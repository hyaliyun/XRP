It has similar function to canstatin, endostatin, restin, and arresten, which also affect angiogenesis.http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=Tumstatin Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing blood vessels, and is important in tumor growth and metastasis. Angiogenesis is stimulated by many growth factors, the most prevalent of which is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Structure and Function Tumstatin is a 28 kDa fragment cleaved from collagen type IV There are two subsegments of the peptide that are active; T3 peptide and T7 peptide.http://www.phoenixpeptide.com/catalog/pnxfoget.php?id=pnxnews_000000444&title;=Compound‚àë=Function. The structure is very similar to that of endostatin, which is cleaved from collagen XVIII. The two proteins share 14% amino acid identity, making them very similar in structure. It has been proven to inhibit many types of cells, including bovine endothelial cells, HeLa cells, endothelial cells, and Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cells. Mechanism of action The tumstatin fragment is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP) at the alpha chain on the collagen strand. Tumstatin interacts with the Œ±vŒ≤3 integrin found in the apoptosis pathway. There are two activation sites on the tumstatin fragment. One is at the N-terminus and is responsible for inhibiting angiogenesis. The other is at the C-terminus end and is primarily responsible for the proapoptotic action. Tumstatin inhibits the activation of FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In addition to affecting these pathways, it also prevents the dissociation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E protein (eIF4E) from 4Ebinding protein 1. These pathways are involved in cell proliferation, so tumstatin reacting with them results in changes in the amount of cell division that occurs. =Antiangiogenesis actions= Since tumstatin has been shown to reduce angiogenesis in tumors, there is great potential to use this knowledge as treatment for cancer. Tumstatin binds to the endothelium of the tumor and is thus able to affect tumor growth. By affecting the apoptotic pathway, tumstatin inhibits the proliferation of endothelial cells. Tumstatin is a cell-specific inhibitor for protein synthesis and therefore affects angiogenesis, which occurs at the protein synthesis level. It has been shown that the efficacy of tumstatin in reducing angiogenesis in tumors increases with tumor size (tumors larger than 500 mm¬≥). In addition to limiting the proliferation of endothelial cells, tumstatin also limits angiogenesis in melanoma cells. The 54-132 amino acid sequence of the tumstatin fragment binds both endothelial and melanoma cells but only inhibits endothelial cell proliferation which the 185-203 amino acid sequence also binds both and inhibits only melanoma proliferation. This is important in discovering the correct binding sites for different cells types and could help to make cancer therapies more cell-type specific. One study showed that mice with a genetic deletion of the Œ±vŒ≤3 integrin showed accelerated tumor growth and that when tumstatin was replaced into the system, the tumor growth was disrupted and the tumor shrunk. It has also been shown that tumstatin has antiangiogenic properties in prostate cancer cells (PCa). PCa was introduced onto a Matrigel and treated with tumstatin, and the formation of new blood vessels as seen in the control did not occur with tumstatin. These studies suggest that tumstatin may be a viable treatment for many types of cancer, including but not limited to melanoma and prostate cancer. Combination treatments involving tumstatin paired with another cancer- fighting drug could be extremely beneficial. One study combined treatments of tumstatin with bevacizumab, or Avastin. This was very successful in downregulating the proliferation of renal carcinoma cells in xenografts. =Proapoptotic actions= The second mechanism of action for tumstatin in combating cancer cells is to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis is induced through the same receptor as the antiangiogenic receptor, Œ±vŒ≤3. It has been shown to increase apoptosis in HUVEC cells as well as HeLa cells. One study has been done to determine the exact pathway used by tumstatin to induce apoptosis. This revealed that the pathway occurs within the mitochondria. The study used HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells to test this, and found that tumstatin upregulated the expression of Caspase-9, Fas, Bax, Bid, and p53 while downregulating Bcl-2. The addition of tumstatin induced the release of cytochrome c by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential. These results show that the proapoptotic activation pathway for tumstatin occurs through mitochondrial regulation, and can aid in determining appropriate cancer treatments. Role in other diseases Since the mechanisms of both of these pathways are not unique to cancer, tumstatin‚Äôs regulation of angiogenesis and apoptosis has potential to treat other diseases affected by these pathways as well. =Diabetes= Diabetic nephropathy as a result of diabetes mellitus is a result of persistent high blood sugar, and is characterized by a lessened globular filtration rate. The mechanism behind diabetic nephropathy is similar to that of angiogenesis, and for this reason, tumstatin may have implications in treating the disease. It was found that VEGF is one of the mediators of glomerular hypertrophy, which causes nephropathy. Since tumstatin inhibits the binding of VEGF, it inhibits diabetic nephropathy as well as resulting in decreased glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration. These findings suggest that tumstatin might be used as a treatment for diabetes by regulating the angiogenesis pathways. =Asthma= In patients with asthma, treatment with tumstatin may be beneficial. Type-IV collagen is present in the basement membrane within normal lungs, and this is reduced in asthmatic patients. There are also increased levels of MMP in the lungs of asthmatics. Since tumstatin is cleaved by MMP from the collagen in the basement membrane, it has been found that there are much lower levels of tumstatin in the airways of asthmatics than in normal patients. This could account for the increased angiogenesis and hyperresponsiveness of the airways. Increasing the levels of tumstatin in the airways would lead to decreased angiogenesis and therefore eased breathing.

This abnormal gene fusion leads to the production of a protein (EML4-ALK) that appears, in many cases, to promote and maintain the malignant behavior of the cancer cells. The transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene was first reported in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in 2007. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of this lung cancer variant seem to mimic those of the underlying major cell type. Diagnosis =Classification= Most lung carcinomas containing the EML4-ALK gene fusion are adenocarcinomas. Some studies suggest that the papillary adenocarcinoma and the signet ring cell adenocarcinoma variants are more likely to carry this fused gene than other histological variants. Screening Micrograph showing an ALK positive adenocarcinoma of the lung. ALK immunostain. Screening for ALK positive lung cancer is now a standard of care in the United States and Canada. Screening can be done with immunostaining, FISH, or next-generation sequencing (NGS). Treatment Crizotinib is a targeted therapy (FDA approved in 2011), manufactured by Pfizer and marketed under the brand name Xalkori and Crizalk that targets the EML4/ALK fusion gene. Ceritinib is a second generation targeted therapy (FDA approved in 2014), manufactured by Novartis and sold under the brand name Zykadia that also targets the EML4 fusion gene, but as a second generation drug it has a smaller molecule that allows superior penetration of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) over Crizotinib and is more capable of protecting the Central Nervous System (CNS).

However, crizotinib showed no improvement on overall survival compared to chemotherapy https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/202570s019lbl.pdf . This may be due to the fact that there was a 70% crossover rate to crizotinib in patients treated initially with chemotherapy. Also, patients who tested negative for EML4/ALK fusion had a response rate to crizotinib of up to 35% https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf11/P110012B.pdf . Epidemiology EML4-ALK gene fusions occur almost exclusively in carcinomas arising in non- smokers. About 4% of non-small-cell lung carcinomas involve an EML4-ALK tyrosine kinase fusion gene. 4-6% of lung adenocarcinomas involve the fusion gene.

Wide Awake!\\" In 1846, the 2d Regiment, Indiana Volunteers, Indiana Brigade was mustered into Federal Service for the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and was again federalized in 1861 during the American Civil War. It was reorganized in 1882 into the Indiana Legion, which was renamed the Indiana National Guard 5 March 1895. The 151st Infantry Regiment is credited with 24 campaigns from the Civil War due to lineage traced to the 7th, 10th, and 11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiments. The Regiment was again federalized in 1898 for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1900, it was reorganized as the First Infantry, Indiana National Guard. The First Infantry was mustered into federal service at Fort Benjamin Harrison in 1916 for service in the Mexican Border Campaign. With the outbreak of World War I, the First Infantry was reorganized into the 151st Infantry Regiment, and assigned to the 76th Infantry Brigade, 38th Division. The division was mobilized for Federal service in 1917 and demobilized in 1919. The division was again activated in 1941 in preparation for World War II.

He graduated from University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1980. His career has spanned four decades. A concern for cities and the well being of its residents unites his many efforts. Early Work At the age of 23 Condon worked as a community organizer in his hometown of Brockton, Massachusetts. There, he collaborated with residents in an impoverished neighbourhood, working with them to lobby for and build a series of neighbourhood improvements including a community built park, Off Street Park, providing a safe recreation area for local families.  Education  Inspired by that effort, Condon pursued professional education as a landscape architect, completing his undergraduate education, graduating summa cumme laude Bachelor of Science in 1978 and a Masters in Landscape Architecture in 1981, both degrees from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  Professional work  He then worked as a city planner in Westfield Massachusetts, a medium-sized city in the Pioneer Valley region of Massachusetts, managing affordable housing programs, downtown restoration efforts, and planning policy changes. He stepped down from his position as Westfield's Director of Community Development in 1984, with the intention of joining academia.  Academic Positions  After a year of European travel, Condon took a tenure track position at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, Department of Landscape Architecture. He was granted tenure at that University in 1990. In 1992 he moved to Canada, taking a position as Chair of the UBC Landscape Architecture Program University of British Columbia. In 1996 he assumed the UBC Chair in Landscape and Livable Environments, a position he still holds.http://www.jtc.sala.ubc.ca/staff.html He was promoted to full professor by UBC in 2006.  Scholarship  For the past 25 years, Condon has devoted his scholastic efforts to working with communities to create affordable and sustainable communities. At the core of his work is the premise that sustainable communities can be spawned only in an atmosphere of collaboration. Many stakeholders must combine efforts to solve sustainability problems, as the variables in such complex problems are too numerous for other methodologies to handle. Notable successes include City of Surrey East Clayton Sustainable Neighbourhood, now nearing completion. The project provided a new model for housing over 10,000 people in affordable and sustainable accommodations in a walkable, mixed use, affordable community. Condon has managed multiparty round table urban design and planning projects in more than 20 communities, many cataloged here: http://www.jtc.sala.ubc.ca/, many of them under the aegis of the UBC Design Centre for Sustainability, a sustainable community design thinktank that he founded in 1998 http://dcs-jtc- charrettes.sala.ubc.ca/  UBC Urban Design Program  Most recently Condon took the lead role in founding the UBC Urban Design Program, whose goal is to equip future urban designers with the knowledge and skills needed to meet the challenges of modern urban growth, now in its fifth year. The intensive 11-month curriculum focuses on enhancing the understanding of urban design at all scales‚Äîfrom the neighbourhood block to the regional. The post-professional course of study integrates design studios with courses in urban design history and theory, economics, and public policy.  Politics  Condon has had a lifelong passion for political engagement. He has put his name before the Vancouver electorate for the position of Vancouver mayor.  Writings  He has worked for many years to advance sustainable urban design in Canada and elsewhere in the world. He has lectured widely, and is the author of several books, notably Design Charrettes for Sustainable Communities (2007) and Seven Rules for Sustainable Communities (2010), both by Island Press. He has published a third book with them, titled Five Rules for Tomorrow's Cities; Design in an age of Urban Migration, Demographic Change, and a Disappearing Middle Class. He and his research partners have collaborated with the City of North Vancouver to produce the \\"100 Year Sustainability Vision\\" a plan to make North Vancouver a zero carbon community. Professor Condon and his partners have received awards from the Canadian Institute of Planners and the American Society of Landscape Architects for their work.

It is a colourless solid that is used for treating cellulose-based heavy fabrics to inhibit wrinkle formation. Dimethylol ethylene urea (DMEU) bonds with the hydroxyl groups present in long cellulose chains and prevents the formation hydrogen bonding between the chains, the primary cause of wrinkling.Klaus Fischer et al. \\"Textile Auxiliaries\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. This treatment produces permanently wrinkle-resistant fabrics and is different from the effects achieved from using fabric softeners. Mechanism Wrinkles form in cotton fabrics due to the free hydroxyl groups. Cotton is a form of cellulose chains linked to form firm three-dimensional structures that offer both tensile strength and flexibility due to their carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bond based backbone. Since cellulose is composed of glucose units, cyclic carbohydrate molecules, cellulose has free hydroxyl groups (-OH) projecting from each monomeric subunit. These hydroxyl groups tend form hydrogen-bonds to neighboring hydroxyl groups. When the fabric is stressed either by heat or pressure, the original hydrogen bonds in the cotton fabric break and reform with nearby atoms at random. This re-forming of the hydrogen bonds, known as cross linking, is the reason for wrinkles, or creases, in the fabric. DMEU works to prevent these wrinkles by covalently bonding to two free hydroxyl groups in the fabric through a dehydration reaction that is not as easily broken as the hydrogen bond before treatment. DMEUcellulose curing As seen in the figure, this formation of a C-O bond through a dehydration reaction (loss of water) allows the fabric to be bleached and heated to reasonable temperatures without fear of breaking the C-O bonds formed. DMEU is applied industrially to the fabric after all the creases desired for design are in place. The fabric is heated and a DMEU resin is slathered on to the fabric. Depending on the procedure, the residue may contain metal catalysts or acid catalysts to help with the reaction. Production The production of DMEU is through the condensation of formaldehyde with ethylene urea:Wayland R. L. Manufacture of Ethylene Urea and the Dimethylol Derivative Thereof. Patent. March 4th, 1958, Serial number: 654,645. :2CH2O + (C2H4N2H2)CO ‚Üí (C2H2N2(CH2OH)2)CO The reaction proceeds around 200 ¬∞C but this temperature can be brought down to around 70 ¬∞C in the presence of an acid catalyst. :DMEU synthesis History Before the development of DMEU, formaldehyde and its derivatives were used as anti-wrinkle agents. These agents could successfully inhibit wrinkle formation. After contact with hydrochlorate bleaches at high temperatures, however, the treated fabric released hydrochloric acid, which degraded the fabric. Additionally, formaldehyde evaporates easily and is pungent. A search for stabler alternatives to formaldehyde led to dimethylol formaldehyde derivatives such as DMEU. The five member ring structure of DMEU, a 2-imidazolidone, resists attack by chlorine during bleaching. As an additional advantage, DMEU can be used to treat fabrics at relatively mild conditions and does not release pungent smells. The use of DMEU on cotton was patented by Rohm and Haas Co. in 1941. As suitable as DMEU was as an anti- wrinkle agent, it decreases dramatically the tensile strength of the fabric. Because DMEU inhibited new hydrogen bond formation, it also hindered cottons ability to shift its cotton fibers to spread out pressure applied to the fabric. This problem regarding the loss of tensile strength is common amongst cotton treatments. Currently, DMEU is used along with other formaldehyde urea derivatives for cotton fabrics of varying tear strength, color, softness, and ease of care. Health Concerns DMEU is a formaldehyde derivative and thus has been known to cause irritation of the skin and allergic reactions from those who are exposed to the resin for extended periods of time. DMEU is a mild irritant and if consumed in moderate quantities may have adverse effects on the body. References Further reading * Vargantwar, P. H.

Centrosomes are the major microtubule organizing centers (MTOC) in mammalian cells. Failure of centrosome regulation can cause mistakes in chromosome segregation and is associated with aneuploidy. A centrosome is composed of two orthogonal cylindrical proteins, called centrioles, which are surrounded by an electron and protein dense amorphous cloud of pericentriolar material (PCM). The PCM is essential for nucleation and organization of microtubules. The centrosome cycle is important to ensure that daughter cells receive a centrosome after cell division. As the cell cycle progresses, the centrosome undergoes a series of morphological and functional changes. Initiation of the centrosome cycle occurs early in the cell cycle in order to have two centrosomes by the time mitosis occurs. Since the centrosome organizes the microtubules of a cell, t has to do with the formation of the mitotic spindle, polarity and, therefore, cell shape, as well as all other processes having to do with the mitotic spindle. The centriole is the inner core of the centrosome, and its conformation is typically somewhat like that of spokes on a wheel. It has a somewhat different conformation amount different organisms, but its overall structure is similar. Plants, on the other hand, do not typically have centrioles. The centrosome cycle consists of four phases that are synchronized to the cell cycle. These include: centrosome duplication during the G1 phase and S Phase, centrosome maturation in the G2 phase, centrosome separation in the mitotic phase, and centrosome disorientation in the late mitotic phase‚ÄîG1 phase. Centriole synthesis Centrioles are generated in new daughter cells through duplication of pre-existing centrioles in the mother cells. Each daughter cell inherits two centrioles (one centrosome) surrounded by pericentriolar material as a result of cell division. However, the two centrioles are of different ages. This is because one centriole originates from the mother cell while the other is replicated from the mother centriole during the cell cycle. It is possible to distinguish between the two preexisting centrioles because the mother and daughter centriole differ in both shape and function. For example, the mother centriole can nucleate and organize microtubules, whereas the daughter centriole can only nucleate. First, procentrioles begin to form near each preexisting centriole as the cell moves from the G1 phase to the S phase. During S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, the procentrioles elongate until they reach the length of the older mother and daughter centrioles. At this point, the daughter centriole which takes on characteristics of a mother centriole. Once they reach full length, the new centriole and its mother centriole form a diplosome. A diplosome is a rigid complex formed by an orthogonal mother and newly formed centriole (now a daughter centriole) that aids in the processes of mitosis. As mitosis occurs, the distance between mother and daughter centriole increases until, congruent with anaphase, the diplosome breaks down and each centriole is surrounded by its own pericentriolar material. Centrosome duplication Cell cycle regulation of centrosome duplication Centrosomes are only supposed to replicate once in each cell cycle and are therefore highly regulated. The centrosome cycle has been found to be regulated by multiple things, including reversible phosphorylation and proteolysis. It also undergoes specific processes in each step of cell division due to the heavy regulation, which is why the process is so efficient. Centrosome duplication is heavily regulated by cell cycle controls. This link between the cell cycle and the centrosome cycle is mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). Cdk2 is a protein kinase (an enzyme) known to regulate the cell cycle. There has been ample evidence that Cdk2 is necessary for both DNA replication and centrosome duplication, which are both key events in S phase. It has also been shown that Cdk2 complexes with both cyclin A and cyclin E and this complex is critical for centrosome duplication. Three Cdk2 substrates have been proposed to be responsible for regulation of centriole duplication: nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), CP110, and MPS1. Nucleophosmin is only found in unreplicated centrosomes and its phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin E removes NPM from the centrosomes, initiating procentriole formation. CP110 is an important centrosomal protein that is phosphorylated by both mitotic and interphase Cdk/cyclin complexes and is thought to influence centrosome duplication in the S phase. [19] MPS1 is a protein kinase that is essential to the spindle assembly checkpoint, and it is thought to possibly remodel an SAS6-cored intermediate between severed mother and daughter centrioles into a pair of cartwheel protein complexes onto which procentrioles assemble. Centrosome maturation Centrosome maturation is defined as the increase or accumulation of Œ≥-tubulin ring complexes and other PCM proteins at the centrosome. This increase in Œ≥ -tubulin gives the mature centrosome greater ability to nucleate microtubules. Phosphorylation plays a key regulatory role in centrosome maturation, and it is thought that Polo-like kinases (Plks) and Aurora kinases are responsible for this phosphorylation. [21] The phosphorylation of downstream targets of Plks and Aurora A lead to the recruitment of Œ≥ ‚Äìtubulin and other proteins that form PCM around the centrioles. [23] Centrosome separation In early mitosis, several motor proteins drive the separation of centrosomes. With the onset of prophase, the motor protein dynein provides the majority of the force required to pull the two centrosomes apart. The separation event actually occurs at the G2/M transition and happens in two steps. In the first step, the connection between the two parental centrioles is destroyed. In the second step, the centrosomes are separated via microtubule motor proteins. Centrosome disorientation Centrosome disorientation refers to the loss of orthogonality between the mother and daughter centrioles. Once disorientation occurs, the mature centriole begins to move toward the cleave furrow. It has been proposed that this movement is a key step in abscission, the terminal phase of cell division. Centrosome reduction Centrosome reduction is the gradual loss of centrosomal components that takes place after mitosis and during differentiation In cycling cells, after mitosis the centrosome has lost most of its pericentriolar material (PCM) and its microtubule nucleation capacity. In sperm, centriole structure is also changed in addition to the loss of PCM and its microtubule nucleation capacity. Dysregulation of the centrosome cycle Improper progression through the centrosome cycle can lead to incorrect numbers of centrosomes and aneuploidy, which could eventually lead to cancer. The role of centrosomes in tumor progression is unclear. The mis- expression of genes such as p53, BRCA1, Mdm2, Aurora-A and survivin causes an increase in the amount of centrosomes present in a cell. However, it is not well understood how these genes influence the centrosome or how an increase in centrosomes influences tumor progression.  The Centrosome Cycle and Disease  Issues with the centrosome can have detrimental effects on the cell, which can lead to diseases in the organisms hosting the cells. Cancer is a heavily studied disease that has been found to have a relation to the cell's centrosome. Dwarfism, microcephaly, and ciliopathies have also recently been genetically linked to centrosome proteins. Centrosomes are believed to be related to cancer due to the fact that they contain tumor suppressor proteins and oncogenes. These proteins have been found to cause detrimental alterations in the centrosome of various tumor cells. There are two main categories of the centrosome alteration: structural and functional. The structural changes can lead to different shapes, sizes, numbers, positions, or composition, while the functional changes can lead to issues with the microtubules and mitotic spindles, therefore becoming detrimental in cell division. Researchers are hopeful that the targeting of carious centrosomal proteins may be a possible treatment to or prevention of cancer.

Part of the 21st Brigade, 7th Division, the battalion was raised from Second Australian Imperial Force volunteers drawn mainly from the state of Victoria. After completing training in Australia in 1940, the battalion deployed to the Middle East where it was stationed in Egypt and Palestine before it saw action against the Vichy French in Syria in June and July 1941, in a short lived campaign. Garrison duties in Lebanon followed before the battalion was withdrawn to Australia in early 1942 as Australian forces were concentrated in the Pacific to respond to the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. After a short period of re-training in Australia to prepare for jungle warfare, the battalion was deployed to New Guinea in August 1942 as the Australians sent reinforcements to the Kokoda Track to fight against Japanese forces that had been advancing towards Port Moresby. After the Japanese were forced to exhaust their supplies they began to fall back towards their beachheads on the north coast. The 2/14th was part of the Australian advance that then saw further action around Gona. In September 1943, after a period of re-organisation in Australia, the battalion took part in the advance on Lae as the Allies went on the offensive in New Guinea, before taking part in the fighting in the Markham and Ramu Valleys of the Finisterre Range campaign. The battalion's final involvement in the war came in the landing on Balikpapan in 1945. The 2/14th was disbanded after the war, in early 1946. History =Formation= The 2/14th Battalion was raised on 26 April 1940 at Puckapunyal, Victoria, shortly after the start of World War II as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), which was established at the time from personnel that had volunteered to serve in combat overseas. The battalion was assigned to the 21st Brigade, 7th Division, and would remain part of this formation throughout its existence. It had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, and most of those were drawn from the state of Victoria, although some were allocated from other states later as reinforcements. Many of the battalion's initial recruits had previous military experience, having served in the Militia prior to volunteering for the 2nd AIF, with the majority having to relinquish rank to transfer. Officially the battalion's average age on formation was 29, although the battalion historian, William Russell, asserts that this is not necessarily accurate as men were found to have altered their ages both up (from as young as 15) and down (from as old as 55) upon recruitment. In keeping with 2nd AIF recruitment practices, there were many pairs of brothers who were early recruits; there was even one case of a father and son who served in the same platoon. Soon after battalion headquarters was established, the battalion's first commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Cannon, began choosing his officers, who then set about the task of forming their own companies and platoons, as the unit structure was built up around four rifle companies ‚Äì designated 'A' through to 'D' ‚Äì with a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company consisting of several specialist platoons including signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administration and mortars. The battalion's companies were formed largely along territorial lines, with 'A' Company being drawn mainly from the Mildura and north-eastern regions of Victoria, while 'B' Company was drawn from Geelong, the Western District, Prahran, Brighton and the Mornington Peninsula. 'C' Company consisted largely of men from Ballarat and Melbourne's inner suburbs, and men of Scottish ancestry, while those of Irish ancestry formed 'D' Company. Once the battalion's complement of men had arrived at Puckapunyal and formation was complete, basic training began in May 1940. On 18 August, the battalion was presented its regimental colours in a ceremony by members of the 14th Battalion, who had served during World War I. This was done in order to establish links with the units of the First Australian Imperial Force, and later, in early October, the 2/14th Battalion changed its unit colour patch from a black over blue diamond to the yellow and blue rectangle of its earlier counterpart. Shortly after this, although still only partially trained, the battalion received orders to deploy overseas, and on 18 October the men embarked upon the Aquitania in Sydney, New South Wales, bound for the Middle East. =Middle East= Travelling via India, where they camped at Deolali, near Bombay, the battalion arrived at Kantara, in Egypt on 25 November 1940 and were transported to Julius Camp in Palestine, where the soldiers undertook further training. Later, they were moved to Dimra in January 1941, before being sent in April to Mersa Matruh, in Egypt, to defend against a possible German attack there during the Siege of Tobruk. Although no German attack came there, during their time at Maaten Bagush the battalion was subjected to aerial attack. It remained there until the end of May when the battalion was relieved by a South African battalion. The 21st Brigade then returned to Palestine to begin preparations for operations in Syria and Lebanon against the Vichy French in order to prevent the area from falling into the hands of the Germans who could then have launched an attack on the Suez Canal from there, or captured the oilfields in Persia (present-day Iran). The 2/14th Battalion's involvement in the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign began on the night of 7/8 June when the unit advanced across the Palestine border from Hanita and attacked Vichy outposts around the village of Alma Chaab. Following this, the battalion advanced along the coast towards Tyre, from where it evicted the French defenders before forcing a crossing over the Litani River. On 11 June, the 21st Brigade's advance towards Sidon came up against determined resistance around the Zahrani River, at Merdjayoun. The 2/14th Battalion found themselves up against troops from the French Foreign Legion's 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment. For the next few days the battalion came under attack from Vichy French aircraft and artillery before being committed to a flanking action on 15 June. Conducting a march during the heat of the day, the Australians approached Sidon through the mountains but arrived just after the town fell to the 2/27th Battalion. alt=Soldiers in tropical uniforms climb on to a truck Following this, on 17 June, the battalion was moved to the central sector of the Allied advance in order to reinforce the 2/31st Battalion, attached to the 25th Brigade, which was holding off a Vichy French counter-attack at Jezzine. After Damascus was captured on 22 June, the 2/14th Battalion was committed to the fighting to secure a number of features on Mount Kharatt, high ground north-east of the town which dominated the surrounding area. These attacks proved unsuccessful, and quite costly for the 2/14th, with 12 killed and 47 wounded on 24 June. The fighting around Jezzine continued until 29 June when the French began to withdraw. After this, the Australians regained the initiative and on 2 July the 2/14th Battalion left Jezzine to begin preparations for the Battle of Damour, to which it was committed on 5 July 1941. Between then and 9 July, the 2/14th were involved in a number of attacks, capturing French positions on Hills 243 and 567. On 12 July, an armistice came into effect, ending the fighting. Following this, the 2/14th Battalion was initially used to conduct battlefield clearance tasks before moving to Beirut where the men were used as garrison troops overseeing the repatriation of captured Vichy soldiers to France. Later, in September, the battalion was transferred to the north to construct defensive positions near Tripoli in Lebanon. In December 1941, following the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor and in Malaya, the decision was made to bring the 6th and 7th Divisions back to Australia. In early January 1942, the 7th Division left Syria, where it had been undertaking garrison duties, and returned to Palestine. The 2/14th were moved to a camp near Jerusalem, and during this time command of the battalion passed to Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Key, who had previously commanded the 2/8th Battalion. On 30 January 1942 the 2/14th Battalion embarked on the transport Ile de France from Port Tewfik in Egypt, bound for Australia. The 2/14th's casualties during its deployment to the Middle East were 21 killed, 94 wounded and 11 captured. =Kokoda Track= The battalion returned to Australia via Bombay, where the infantrymen were transferred to the troopship City of Paris in early February. They arrived in Adelaide, South Australia, on 24 March 1942. After this a period of leave followed, and then the battalion undertook defensive duties and training around Yandina, Queensland, before being dispatched along with the rest of the 7th Division to New Guinea where the situation on the Kokoda Track was becoming critical for the Australians as the Japanese advanced towards Port Moresby. On 13 August 1942, the 21st Brigade, including the 2/14th Battalion, disembarked in Port Moresby. Three days later, 16 August, the battalion was transported on trucks to Ilolo before marching to Uberi, reaching Myola on 21 August. On 25 August, the battalion received orders to relieve the severely depleted 39th Battalion, which was holding the Japanese at Isurava. Due to a shortage of supplies it was only possible for one company to move at a time, and as a result 'C' Company was dispatched to Isurava first, while 'B' and 'D' Companies were dispatched to Alola and 'A' Company moved to Templeton's Crossing. 'C' Company subsequently reached the 39th's position late in the evening of 26 August. The following day, the Japanese launched a fresh offensive with three battalions from the 144th Infantry Regiment, and throughout the day a number of minor engagements took place. On 27 August, the Japanese offensive began in earnest as the 39th Battalion's positions around Isurava were subjected to heavy mortar and artillery fire. Japanese infantry broke into the position through the gaps between one of company's depleted platoons, but the situation was restored by two Australian counter-attacks. alt=A group of weary soldiers in a jungle scene The rest of the 2/14th Battalion arrived on 28 August amidst continuing fighting, bringing with them a mortar for indirect fire support. The 39th Battalion then moved to the rear, but remained in support of the 2/14th in order to help repel the next wave of the Japanese attack. By 29 August, the Japanese had about six battalions around Isurava, and in the morning fresh attacks succeeded in breaking into the 2/14th's position with 'C' Company, on the battalion's right, being forced to give ground. With the situation critical, the Australians launched a counter-attack. As a part of this attack, Private Bruce Kingsbury charged the Japanese, firing his Bren light machine gun from the hip, killing at least 30 of them and forcing others to withdraw. Although Kingsbury was subsequently killed by a sniper, his actions allowed the Australians to briefly regain their positions and later he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, Australia's highest military decoration. Further attacks during the day, however, forced the battalion to fall back down the track. On 30 August, the Japanese began threatening the 2/14th's left flank from the high ground situated there, and as another attack put the battalion's rear in jeopardy, the battalion was forced to give more ground. At this point, the brigade commander, Brigadier Arnold Potts, authorised a withdrawal to Alola. With the Japanese pressing against their rear guard, over the course of the following fortnight, the battalion fought a series of delaying actions and fighting withdrawals towards Ioribaiwa and Imita Ridge. By the time it reached Imita Ridge, the 2/14th was so depleted that it was amalgamated with the 2/16th Battalion to form a composite battalion of just over 300 men, and as the 21st Brigade prepared to make a final stand, the battalions of the 25th Brigade arrived to relieve them. Following this, the composite battalion was withdrawn from the line on 16 September. The 2/14th Battalion had begun the Kokoda campaign with 546 men, but upon arriving at Uberi, where they had been placed in reserve, there were only 88 men available, of whom only three were officers. Casualties were high, with 110 men being killed in action, with two more dying of their wounds and another four being killed in accidents. A further 132 were also wounded. =Gona= Following the 21st Brigade's relief, the fighting in New Guinea began to turn in favour of the Allies, as the Japanese, having exhausted their supplies, began to fall back towards their beachheads on the north coast. By November 1942, although the 2/14th had been reformed at Koitaki, near Port Moresby, it was still not up to full strength, with a total of only 341 men of all ranks. Nevertheless, the situation in New Guinea meant that the 21st Brigade was needed to help capture the Japanese beachhead around Gona on the north-eastern coast. The 2/14th Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Challen who had replaced Key in late September, after the latter had been captured and executed by the Japanese following the fighting around Isurava, was placed in the vanguard of the brigade's move, being air transported to Popondetta on 25 November. Organised into three half-strength companies, the following day the battalion began the march towards Gona. On 29 November, the 2/14th attacked along the coast to the east of Gona. The Japanese positions were well-concealed and amidst strong resistance the 2/14th suffered heavy casualties, losing 13 killed and 23 wounded. Early in the morning on 30 November the battalion lost another three killed before it launched a well-planned deliberate attack on the remaining Japanese fortified position. For only two minor casualties, the 2/14th forced the Japanese defenders to abandon their positions and managed to break through to the beach, securing about along the coast. On 8 December, a reinforced platoon from the 2/14th was ordered to conduct a reconnaissance around Haddy's Village, west of Gona, where the Japanese had landed reinforcements on 6 December. Under the command of Lieutenant Bob Dougherty, the platoon launched a surprise attack against the numerically superior force. In the hand-to-hand fighting that followed over 90 Japanese were killed or wounded, while six men from the 2/14th were wounded. The attack proved a success and enabled the Australians around Gona to attack without concern about being engaged by the Japanese reinforcements. Gona was subsequently taken on 9 December. Dougherty was killed leading a patrol around the village on 11 December. The battalion remained in the area until 8 January 1943, by which time there were only 21 fit personnel left. They were subsequently returned to Australia. Casualties during the fighting around Buna, Gona and Sanananda amounted to 50 killed in action or died of wounds or accidentally, as well as 88 wounded. =Lae and the Finisterres= By the time that the 21st Brigade arrived back in Australia, it was heavily depleted, with only 44 per cent of its authorised strength. The 2/14th subsequently underwent a period of rebuilding around Ravenshoe, in Queensland, in preparation for further operations. During this time the units of the 7th Division were converted to the \\"jungle\\" divisional establishment, which saw a reduction in the 2/14th Battalion's authorised strength to just over 800 men. As the battalion was brought back up to strength, in July there was a change of command. On 5 July, Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner, who had previously commanded the 39th Battalion during the fighting on the Kokoda Track, replaced Challen as commanding officer. In August, along with the rest of the 21st Brigade the battalion moved to Port Moresby where it undertook training for the next month in preparation for the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign. However, the battalion was destined to only take a limited role in the campaign, and on 15 September it was dispatched to the airfields at Nadzab to relieve the US Army's 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment and defend the vital airfields from possible Japanese attack. Brigadier Ivan Dougherty (left), 21st Brigade commander, with his battalion commanders. Lieutenant Colonel Philip Rhoden of the 2/14th is fourth from the left. After this, the 2/14th was committed to the advance into the Markham Valley and Finisterre Range, in the vanguard of the 21st Brigade's advance from Kaiapit to Dumpu in late September and early October. Moving through the 2/16th Battalion's position and advancing on to Marawasa, the 2/14th left the Markham Valley and proceeded into the Ramu Valley. The 2/14th then moved on the 2/16th's right flank, protecting it from any Japanese attacks that might have eventuated from the north. On 4 October 1943, the battalion reached Wampun village. It was there that the battalion's commanding officer, Honner, was seriously wounded when he moved beyond the main defensive position in order to personally carry out a reconnaissance of the surrounding area. A platoon was sent in to extricate Honner as the Japanese began advancing on his position, and after directing a company-level attack against the Japanese, Honner handed over command to Captain Ian Hamilton, commander of 'C' Company, who served as acting commander briefly until Major Mert Lee arrived from brigade headquarters. Lee remained in acting command until the battalion second-in- command, Major Philip Rhoden, returned from a staff course to officially take over command of the battalion as a lieutenant colonel in December. Throughout early 1944, the battalion was mainly involved in patrol operations in support of the 21st Brigade's advance up the Faria River to capture the Japanese positions on the Kankiryo Saddle during the Battle of Shaggy Ridge. As a part of this effort, the battalion's most significant engagement came on 11 October 1943 when 9 Platoon, under Lieutenant Noel Pallier, destroyed a Japanese company in capturing a ridge that overlooked the valley. The Japanese company had been threatening to cut off the supply line of the 2/27th Battalion, which was leading the 21st Brigade's advance and the following day, heavy fighting took place around John's Knoll and Trevor's Ridge. After this, the battalion undertook mainly patrol actions in the following weeks, these actions varied in size from small groups to company-sized forces, and varied in length from one day to up to a week. In late November, the battalion relieve the 2/25th Battalion around John's Knoll, marching . From there, they occupied an outpost position opposite a strong Japanese position, against which they clashed several times throughout December until being withdrawn to the rear around the Lakes area in late December, and then Port Moresby in early January 1944. Although there were only limited engagements with the Japanese during the four months that the 2/14th were involved in the campaign, the battalion still suffered heavily with 958 men being evacuated due to illness or accidental injury during this time. Of these, four died and a further 546 were permanently removed from the theatre. In contrast, battle casualties during this time amounted to seven killed in action, three died of wounds and 25 wounded. =Borneo= 3-inch mortar crew in action around Manggar airstrip, 5 July 1945alt=A mortar crew in action After being withdrawn back to Australia in March 1944, the units of the 7th Division received six weeks' leave before reforming on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Following this the 2/14th Battalion undertook a period of training before finally being committed to their last campaign of the war in mid-1945. This campaign saw them take part in the amphibious landings at Balikpapan on 1 July 1945. During the initial landings early on 1 July, the 2/14th came ashore at the wrong place, landing at Yellow Beach when it had been scheduled to land at Green Beach. Nevertheless, the landing was largely unopposed and after 45 minutes of reorganisation the Australians were able to establish themselves at their correct form up point and begin the advance to their first objective: the bridge over the Klandasan Besar. Advancing unopposed they crossed the bridge and at nightfall dug-in in front of the Stalkudo ridge, along the Vasey Highway. The following day, the battalion captured the Sepinggang airstrip as the 21st Brigade began the advance to the east. The 2/27th Battalion subsequently relieved the 2/14th at Sepinggang and on 3 July, the battalion began to move towards the Manggar airstrip. The 21st Brigade then came up against stronger opposition near the Batakan Ketjil River, which held them up until the evening. The following day the 2/14th resumed its advance towards Manggar and after crossing the river and beginning to move across the strip the battalion's lead company began to receive artillery fire from Japanese coastal defence guns. Naval gunfire support was called in to provide counter- battery fire, but this was only partially effective and the following day air support and tanks were brought it. For the next three days minor infantry actions were undertaken around the periphery of the position while direct and indirect fire support was used to reduce the position, with a view to limiting casualties amongst the infantry. Finally, on 9 July, the battalion attacked the two remaining Japanese positions, which had been named \\"Frost\\" and \\"Brown\\" by the Australians. Supported by a naval bombardment and Liberator heavy bombers which dropped napalm, two companies from the 2/14th Battalion captured the position where it found over 100 Japanese dead along with a number of artillery pieces including two 120 mm naval guns and four 75 mm high-angle guns, as well as numerous heavy mortars and machine-guns. This represented the last of the 2/14th Battalion's major combat actions of the war. The 21st Brigade subsequently captured Sambodja and then as the tempo of operations wound down in anticipation of the end of the war, the Australians began conducting patrol operations in the interior, stretching towards the 25th Brigade's area along the Milford Highway. The battalion's casualties in its final campaign of the war amounted to 21 killed and 41 wounded. =Disbandment= alt=Soldiers marching under arms with rifles at the slope file past a drum band Following the cessation of hostilities in August 1945, the 2/14th Battalion remained on Borneo until October 1945 when it was moved to Makassar in the Celebes Islands (present-day Sulawesi, Indonesia). The battalion's personnel arrived there on 1 October 1945 but shortly thereafter the 2/14th was transported by sea to Pare-Pare, arriving there on 5 October. While there the battalion undertook garrison duties, guarding Japanese prisoners of war and maintaining administration and law and order until the Dutch were in a position to re-assert colonial rule. Despite the complex political situation, the 2/14th Battalion managed to achieve this without violence and on 5 January 1946 the 50th Battalion, Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, began to arrive to relieve them. This was completed by 17 January. On 22 January 1946 the battalion embarked on , bound for Australia. Upon arrival in Brisbane, Queensland, the demobilisation process began and the battalion's ranks were quickly reduced. Finally, on 22 February 1946, at Victoria Barracks the final paperwork was signed off and the battalion was disbanded. During the course of the war, a total of 2,990 men served in the battalion; of these 222 were killed in action or died of wounds, or of illness or accident on active service. A further 378 men from the 2/14th were wounded in action, while 11 men became prisoners of war. The vast majority of these casualties came during the fighting around Kokoda where the battalion suffered 248 battle casualties. For their service during the war, members of the 2/14th received the following gallantry and distinguished service decorations: one Victoria Cross, four Military Crosses, three Distinguished Conduct Medals, 19 Military Medals, one British Empire Medal and 44 Mentions in Despatches. In addition, one member was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. One section from the battalion, 7 Section from 9 Platoon, 'A' Company, is believed to be, according to Dornan, \\"the most highly decorated section in Australian and British military history\\". Of the 11 men that were assigned to 7 Section when it was first formed in 1940, one of them received the Victoria Cross, one received a Distinguished Conduct Medal and four received the Military Medal.

The name of no other German poet resonates in the public mind as much as Goethe's, and he is held in an esteem approaching that accorded to Shakespeare in the realm of literature, Michelangelo, in sculpture, or Beethoven in musical composition. In the 19th century, Goetheforschung was associated with non-academic enthusiasts and collectors such as Woldemar von Biedermann who sought personal betterment and enrichment through immersion in Goethe's life and works. In communist East Germany, Goetheforschung was upheld as part of the regime's conservative cultural policy (German: ') promoting Weimar classicism as the foundation of Germany's cultural heritage. In modern Germany and elsewhere, Goethe is often far better known than read.

It is regarded as one of the biggest feuds in MMA history. All three fights took place under Ultimate Fighting Championship in the United States. All three fights have ended in technical knockout with one of them having been for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. At the first meeting at UFC 40, Ortiz won by technical knockout due to corner stoppage following the third round. By this victory he retained the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. The second time, after The Ultimate Fighter 3, at UFC 61 Ortiz won the rematch by technical knockout at 1:18 in the very first round. At the third and final match-up, Ortiz once again won, making it 3‚Äì0 for himself, by technical knockout at 2:22 in the first round. In 2012, UFC owner Lorenzo Fertitta described the feud; \\"A lot of it had to do with their personalities - Ortiz was young, he was brash, he was irreverent. Ken Shamrock was a guy who was well-respected, had accomplished a lot in this sport.\\"https://thestarphoenix.com/sports/owner+reflects+bouts/6944072/story.html Background The feud began to build on January 8, 1999, at UFC 18. After upsetting top UFC fighter and Lion's Den member Jerry Bohlander, Ortiz, with his fingers, acted like he was shooting at the Lion's Den corner and coach Ken Shamrock and additionally put on a disrespectful shirt in the octagon after the fight with Bohlander which read \\"I just fked your ass\\". On March 5, 1999, at UFC 19, the feud with Ortiz exploded in one of the biggest and most famous altercations in mixed martial arts history. After Ortiz won a referee stoppage in his rematch with Guy Mezger, Ortiz immediately flipped off the Lion's Den corner and then put on a shirt that said \\"Gay Mezger is my Bitch\\". The actions by Ortiz shocked and stunned the MMA world because at the time, the Lion's Den was highly respected and arguably the most elite fight team in MMA and was composed of numerous top fighters. At the top was the leader, Ken Shamrock, who at the time still held a reputation as being one of the scariest and most skilled fighters associated with the UFC. Shamrock, pictured here in 1998, weighed as much as in the late 1990s during the time when his feud with Tito Ortiz began. After Shamrock saw the shirt, he yelled into the octagon \\"Hey Tito, don't let me see you wearing that shirt!\\". Shamrock then famously leaped onto the top of the cage, screaming at Ortiz and angrily waving his finger in Ortiz's face. Referee John McCarthy picked Ortiz up and carried him across the octagon to prevent the situation from escalating further, as a livid Shamrock was on the verge of jumping into the octagon. Shamrock, who was still in the WWF at the time, was furious after the event. UFC matchmaker Joe Silva said: \\"SEG knew this was bad. Ken was really freaking out. Tables were getting flipped, who knows what was going to happen. So they have to usher Tito back to a room and get him away from the Lion's Den. It was craziness, everybody was just looking at each other and saying, 'Did I see that right? Did that shirt really say what I thought that it said?' Everybody's freaking out about it...there was such a buzz about it, everybody was running around everywhere.\\"Shamrock vs. Ortiz: The Untold Truth. Video Documentary. Action Guy Films Silva added, \\"When I think back and remember all the cool things, all the exciting and crazy things in the UFC, that night is definitely burned into my memory.\\" Ortiz's manager, Sal Garcia, added: \\"one of the other fighters comes in at that point and says, 'hey, Ken Shamrock and the Lion's Den, they want to come over and kick Tito and Sal's asses.'\\" The tension backstage was so great that some feared a brawl between the Lion's Den and Tito Ortiz, Kevin Randleman, Mark Coleman and others from the Hammer House (who were in Ortiz's locker room after the event). The situation was escalated to the point that police and security had to be called in to monitor the situation. Jeff Sherwood, creator of Sherdog, wrote after the event: \\"Someone needs to remind Ken Shamrock that it wasn't Monday Night Raw out there. Not saying he wouldn't tear Tito up though.\\" Sherwood was not alone in his opinion that Shamrock would have been too much for Ortiz to deal with at the time. Shamrock had a reputation of thoroughly and brutally dominating everybody in training at the Lion's Den, including top UFC fighters Guy Mezger and Jerry Bohlander, and Shamrock, at north of , was considerably larger than Ortiz and would be a full weight class above him. Ortiz also expressed reluctance in confronting Shamrock, saying shortly after UFC 19: Many fans were upset that this fight probably would never happen due to the weight difference. However, over time, Shamrock began to lose size and by the time he fought Don Frye three years later in 2002, Shamrock was down to around 220 lbs, making it possible to cut weight to 205. UFC 40: Vendetta On November 22, 2002, at UFC 40, nearly four years after the confrontation at UFC 19, Shamrock returned to the UFC for the first time since December 1996 to fight Ortiz in a title match for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship in one of the biggest, most anticipated and most important fights in UFC history. By this time, Shamrock's skills had diminished significantly due to injuries and aging but he was still considered to be a very dangerous and strong opponent. Although it was understood that Shamrock was past his prime, many people gave Shamrock a good chance to win based on his size (Ortiz had not fought someone as big as Shamrock to that point in his career), punching power, wrestling skill and submission skill. Shamrock's apparent size advantage did not factor into the fight, however; Shamrock experienced difficultly cutting weight for the first time and cut too much weight, weighing in at 201 lbs, 4 lbs under the 205 lb. limit. Ortiz shed light upon his feelings before the fight in his book This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion: \\"Ken Shamrock is a real good fighter. I was not intimidated by him, but I guess you can say I was a little bit afraid.\\"This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion, by Tito Ortiz. Page 123 Color commentator Joe Rogan called the fight a \\"dream match\\" and \\"the most incredible night in mixed martial arts history\\" at the start of the show and admitted that he had no idea who was going to win the fight. The hype and buzz surrounding the MGM Grand Garden Arena for the event was unlike anything mixed martial arts had ever seen before. The event was also monumental for the future of the UFC and the sport as a whole in America for a variety of reasons. UFC 40 sold out the MGM Grand Arena and sold 150,000 pay per view buys, a rate over three times larger than the previous Zuffa events. It also garnered mainstream attention from massive media outlets such as ESPN and USA Today, something that was unfathomable for mixed martial arts at that point in time. Many have suggested that the success of UFC 40 and the anticipation for Ken Shamrock vs. Tito Ortiz saved the UFC from bankruptcy; the buyrates of the previous Zuffa shows averaged a mere 45,000 buys per event and the company was suffering deep monetary losses. The commercial success of UFC 40 provided a glimmer of hope for the UFC and kept alive the dream that mixed martial arts could become big. Although many in the mixed martial arts media either deemed the fight too close to call or gave a slight edge to the younger Ortiz, the fight was not nearly as close as originally expected. Shamrock nearly scored a knockout early in round 1, buckling Ortiz's knees with a punch and dropping him to one knee. However, Ortiz recovered shortly after and went on to dominate the fight with takedowns and ground and pound. The manner in which Ortiz easily secured numerous takedowns was surprising to some because Shamrock had displayed excellent wrestling and takedown defense throughout his career to that point. In addition, the fighters at the Lion's Den claimed that nobody took Shamrock down in training. Shamrock provided excitement for the crowd at the end of rounds 2 and 3, dramatically scrambling to his feet after being dominated from his back, but was unable to mount any significant offense after getting up. Right before Round 4 started, Shamrock's cornerman threw in the towel and Ortiz had successfully defended the UFC light heavyweight championship. After the fight was over, Shamrock revealed that he fought Ortiz with a serious knee injury (a torn ACL). Shamrock's ACL injury explained his ineffective wrestling in the fight, which had been an enormous strength for Shamrock throughout his career prior to the Ortiz fight. Bruce Buffer has said on various occasions that this fight was one of the greatest fights he has ever seen and that the energy from the crowd that night was one of the greatest feelings he has ever experienced. Buffer also compared Shamrock and Ortiz's first fight with boxing's \\"Fight of the Century\\" in Ali vs. Frazier.http://www.boxinginsider.com/mma/talkin%E2%80%99-mma-with-bruce- buffer/ Significance of UFC 40 UFC 40 proved to be the most critical event to date in the Zuffa era. The event sold out the MGM Grand Arena and sold 150,000 pay per view buys, a rate over three times larger than the previous Zuffa events. The event featured a card headlined by a highly anticipated championship grudge match between then-current UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz and former UFC Superfight Champion Ken Shamrock, who had previously defected to professional wrestling in the WWE before returning to MMA. It was the first time the UFC hit such a high mark since being forced \\"underground\\" in 1997.UFC's Pay-Per-View Buys Explode in 2006, Ivan's Blog, originally posted on MMAWeekly.com. Last retrieved November 11, 2006 UFC 40 also garnered mainstream attention from massive media outlets such as ESPN and USA Today, something that was unfathomable for mixed martial arts at that point in time. Many have suggested that the success of UFC 40 and the anticipation for Ortiz vs. Shamrock saved the UFC from bankruptcy; the buyrates of the previous Zuffa shows averaged a mere 45,000 buys per event and the company was suffering deep monetary losses. The success of UFC 40 provided a glimmer of hope for the UFC and kept alive the dream that mixed martial arts could become big. Long time UFC referee \\"Big\\" John McCarthy said that he felt UFC 40 was the turning point in whether or not the sport of MMA would survive in America. UFC 61: Bitter Rivals Ortiz went on to face Randy Couture at UFC 44 for the undisputed UFC Light Heavyweight Championship in September 2003. Ortiz was the favorite going into the fight. Despite this, Couture won a unanimous decision in dominant fashion and became the undisputed UFC light heavyweight champion. The loss ended Ortiz's near three and a half-year title reign, which is still the longest light heavyweight championship reign since the title's inception in 1997. Following his loss to Couture, Ortiz faced Chuck Liddell at UFC 47, losing by second round knockout. After six months off, Ortiz returned and took a unanimous decision victory over newcomer Patrick C√¥t√© at UFC 50 and a split decision over Vitor Belfort at UFC 51. Ortiz than fought against previous The Ultimate Fighter 1 winner Forrest Griffin on April 15, 2006. Ortiz won via split decision. On November 21, 2003, at UFC 45, Shamrock, along with Royce Gracie, became the first inductees to the UFC Hall of Fame. The event celebrated the 10th anniversary of the UFC. UFC President Dana White said; After a two-year layoff to recover from ACL surgery, a 40-year-old Shamrock returned to fight the Kimo Leopoldo at UFC 48 in a rematch of the UFC 8 Superfight Championship match. Kimo was coming off an impressive win over Shamrock's longtime rival, Tank Abbott. Shamrock won the bout in the first round by KO via knee to the head. Shamrock's knee strike to Kimo's chin was so hard that he opened up a cut on his knee after landing the shot. Shamrock's mega drawing power was evident when the pay per view numbers came out for the event; UFC 48 amazingly drew more pay per view buys than the ultra hyped mega fight between mixed martial arts stars Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz one event earlier at UFC 47. Shamrock then faced rising star and future UFC Middleweight Champion Rich Franklin in the main event in a light heavyweight bout on the popular reality series The Ultimate Fighter finale on April 9, 2005. Shamrock reportedly originally signed to fight Ortiz in a rematch at this event but Ortiz would not sign the contract to fight Shamrock again. The event was a monumental moment in UFC history because it was the first ever UFC appearance on basic cable TV. Franklin defeated Shamrock by a TKO in the first round after taking advantage of a Shamrock slip while executing a high kick. At 41 years old, this was the first time Shamrock had ever been knocked out in a mixed martial arts fight in his career. Franklin's win over an icon like Shamrock propelled him into UFC stardom and established him as one of the organization's biggest stars. On October 24, 2005, Shamrock lost to fellow mixed martial arts legend Kazushi \\"The Gracie Hunter\\" Sakuraba in Pride: Fully Loaded, by TKO. The years following the first bout, the rivalry between Ortiz and Shamrock remained very heated. Shamrock hassled UFC president Dana White for a second fight, even going as far to openly challenge Ortiz to a fight following Ortiz's victory over Belfort. Ortiz himself confronted Shamrock at the UFC 48 press conference, stating to Shamrock: \\"If you'd like to come down to 205, I'd love to give you another ass whooping.\\" By the end of 2005, fan interest was still very high to see the two fight again. Shamrock accused Ortiz of avoiding a rematch, citing that Ortiz had been offered a fight with Shamrock numerous times yet refused to sign the contract to fight Shamrock. Ortiz also refused to fight Shamrock at heavyweight. On November 19, 2005 at UFC 56, Dana White, the UFC president, announced that Ortiz finally agreed to face Shamrock in a rematch. Shamrock would be one of the coaches (along with Tito Ortiz) for the upcoming third season of The Ultimate Fighter. Leading up to the fight, Shamrock stated that the fight meant everything to him and that he would be the bully this time and capitalize on Ortiz's mistakes. Ortiz went on to say that his goal in 2006 was to defeat Chuck Liddell and regain the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship but that he would first dismantle Shamrock. On July 8, 2006, at UFC 61, the highly anticipated rematch between Shamrock and a heavily favored Tito Ortiz took place. The pay per view numbers set North American MMA records with 775,000 buys on pay-per-view and a $3.4 million gate. Not everyone, however, was thrilled with the fight. At 42 years old, Shamrock was significantly past his prime and no longer a championship caliber fighter. Former UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz said; A small incident between Shamrock and Ortiz took place prior to the fight at the UFC 61 weigh-ins. After Shamrock weighed in at 206, Ortiz threw a fit, arguing that the fight contract was clear about the weight limit being 205. Nevada State rules, however, allow a fighter in a non-title match to go over the limit by one pound, so Shamrock's weight was not against the rules. Ironically, Ortiz proceeded to weigh in at 206.5 lbs. and had to drop the half-pound before weighing in again. Shamrock lost the rematch with Ortiz in 1:18 of the first round by a technical knockout in a fight that ended in chaotic controversy. Shamrock came out firing, landing a combination of punches to back Ortiz into the cage, but Ortiz successfully secured a double leg takedown on Shamrock, lifting him up and slamming him to the mat. Although Shamrock was now on his back in a disadvantageous position, he did have Ortiz in his full guard. Ortiz, while in Shamrock's full guard, was able to land several elbows to Shamrock's head which went undefended. Referee Herb Dean deemed that Shamrock was no longer able to intelligently defend himself and stopped the fight. Watching the slow-mo, Shamrock did go limp from one elbow but revived for the next. Shamrock and the crowd were furious at the early stoppage and Dana White immediately put together a rematch on television. Ortiz vs. Shamrock 3: The Final Chapter On October 10, 2006, at Ortiz vs. Shamrock 3: The Final Chapter, a 42-year-old Shamrock was a massive underdog to the significantly younger Ortiz. Shamrock was dominated again by Ortiz by KO after referee John McCarthy stopped the fight following multiple undefended fist strikes. The fight took place live on Spike TV. The two-hour broadcast drew a 3.1 overall rating, with the main event of Tito Ortiz vs. Ken Shamrock drawing a 4.3 rating. Quoting MMA Weekly's Ivan Trembow, \\"That breaks down to an amazing 5.7 million viewers for the Ortiz vs. Shamrock fight. This shatters the UFC's previous record for the number of people watching a UFC fight at any given time.\\" The overall ratings record would not be matched until UFC 75 on September 8, 2007. Immediately after the fight, Ortiz initially celebrated his victory with a mocking \\"grave digger\\" routine and an offensive T-shirt that said, \\"Punishing Him into Retirement\\" after giving him the finger. However, Shamrock approached Ortiz and, after the two talked for several seconds, Shamrock said they could put all of their animosity aside as it was always \\"just business\\", shaking hands and burying the hatchet. Ortiz then declared that facing Shamrock had made him a better fighter and thanked Ken for \\"passing the torch\\". Ortiz added in his post-fight interview that he has always looked up to Shamrock. Shamrock gave a gracious speech after the fight but left it ambiguous whether he would retire from the sport. In an interview with Sherdog.com, he stated he was not leaning one way or another whether he will not fight again, but he did not want to lead the fans on. Ken also expressed his feelings after the match: UFC President Dana White said the day after Shamrock's fight with Ortiz, \\"Last night was a turning point for the UFC. This will further drive the evolution of mixed martial arts into a mainstream sport.\\" Spike TV President Kevin Kay credited Shamrock's third fight with Ortiz as the beginning of mainstream advertisers coming into mixed martial arts. Kay said, \\"What [the Ortiz-Shamrock ratings] woke people up to was there‚Äôs an opportunity for 18-34s that is unexploited, and 18-to-34-year- old guys love this...I think one was it did, as you said, wake up the press to [the fact that] there‚Äôs something going on here that was unexpected.\\" Kay added, \\"when those numbers hit for Shamrock-Ortiz, it was, like, ‚ÄúWe have to pay attention, and this is clearly getting a loyal young 18-34.‚Äù I think that was the beginning of more mainstream advertisers coming in to Spike and coming to the mixed martial arts.\\"http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Sherdog- Rewind-An-Interview-with-Spike-TV-President-Kevin-Kay-37767 Ultimately, Shamrock's feud with Ortiz was critically important for the UFC's future and present day success. Shamrock and Ortiz's trilogy, along with the emergence of stars like Chuck Liddell and Randy Couture, resulted in the sport's explosion into the mainstream.UFC.com. http://www.ufc.com/news/UFC-Grudge-Report Aftermath Following their third fight, Ortiz went on to face Chuck Liddell in a rematch for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 66 where he lost via technical knockout. Follow the bout, Ortiz cumulated a record 0-4-1 with losses to Lyoto Machida, Forrest Griffin, and Matt Hamill, and a draw with Rashad Evans, making Shamrock the last win inside the octagon until 2011. Following his loss to Machida, Ortiz left the UFC, citing his frustrations with president Dana White as a major factor but has since returned as of August 2009 and fought Ryan Bader at UFC 132 where he defeated him via submission in the first round. The victory snapped Ortiz's 5-year skid without a win. Shamrock, meanwhile, after a brief retirement, was rumored to face Michael Bisping at UFC 75 but was ultimately released from his UFC contract. Shamrock returned to fighting in 2008 and lost to Robert Berry via technical knockout. He then defeated Ross Clifton on February 13, 2009 via submission and was scheduled to face former WWE wrestler Bobby Lashley in an MMA bout, but tested positive for steroids after the Clifton fight in which he served a one year suspension. He then lost his next to bout to Pedro Rizzo via TKO. He would then go on to defeat Johnathan Ivey via unanimous decision and lose to Mike Bourke via technical knockout due to a leg injury. Shamrock was to have competed against Boxing's Heavyweight Champion James Toney in a specialized MMA bout in Fall 2011, but it did not materialize. Since his return, Shamrock has received much criticism for fighting too far past his prime and has currently won 3 out of his last 12 fights.

Following the protests, he went into hiding and published two editorials critical of the Burmese government in the Washington Post and The Guardian on 4 November 2007. He was arrested the same day. In October 2008, he was sentenced to 68 years in prison, including 12 years hard labour; the sentence was reduced to 65 years on appeal. Gambira reportedly protested his imprisonment by organising chanting with other imprisoned monks, boycotting his trial, and going on hunger strike. Human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also protested his imprisonment. Gambira was released during a mass pardon of prisoners on 13 January 2012 as part of the 2011‚Äì2012 Burmese political reforms. He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he had been unable to find a monastery to join due to his status as a former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012.  Early life  Gambira started attending school at age five, but the 1988 pro-democracy protests caused school closings that interrupted Gambira's schooling. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), he ran away from home at age 12 and was recruited as a child soldier by a military unit in Yangon. Once his brother and his friend located him, they removed him from the unit and returned with him to their home in Pauk Township. When the authorities came to investigate, Gambira's parents enrolled him in a local monastery to protect him from arrest or conscription into further military service.  2007 protests and aftermath  Gambira first became well known in August 2007 during widespread protests against the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the military government which had ruled the country since suppressing the previous uprising in 1988. The protests were sparked when the SPDC cut fuel subsidies without warning, causing fuel and other commodity prices to suddenly rise. The city's Buddhist monks took on a leadership role in these demonstrations, forming the All-Burma Monks' Alliance and lending the uprising its nickname of \\"the Saffron Revolution\\", after the colour of the monks' robes. Gambira, then a 29-year-old monk, became one of the new organisation's leaders. He later stated that the monks had been planning an uprising since 2003 or 2004. Because monks are revered in Burma's Buddhist-majority society, the government at first appeared reluctant to suppress their demonstrations. \\"Saffron Revolution\\" protest, September 2007 On 24 September 2007, the All-Burma Monks' Alliance released a statement condemning the military government: \\"In order to banish the common enemy evil regime from Burmese soil forever, united masses of people need to join hands with the united clergy forces ... We pronounce the evil military despotism, which is impoverishing and pauperizing our people of all walks, including the clergy, as the common enemy of all our citizens.\\" During the demonstrations, Gambira split his time between Mandalay and Yangon, moving between the two cities to avoid arrest. After government forces violently broke up the protests, killing some monks and other protesters, Gambira went into hiding. His brother Aung Kyaw Kyaw was arrested on 17 October, in what the AAPP called an attempt by the government to force Gambira out of hiding. On 4 November, Gambira published editorials in The Washington Post and The Guardian calling for the international community to continue sanctions against Burma's leadership, for Russia and China to cease supporting the SPDC on the United Nations Security Council, and for Burma's people to continue to peacefully protest against the military rulers. \\"The regime's use of mass arrests, murder, torture and imprisonment has failed to extinguish our desire for the freedom that was stolen from us so many years ago. We have taken their best punch\\", he wrote in the Post. The day that the editorials appeared, Gambira was arrested in Sagaing Region. His father was arrested as well and detained in Mandalay prison for a month.  Imprisonment  Gambira stated after his release that authorities had beaten him and deprived him of sleep during his imprisonment, and Human Rights Watch reported that he was \\"badly tortured\\" and stripped of his monk's robes. In April 2008, Gambira's sister reported that he was leading a mettƒÅ chanting campaign among other imprisoned monks of Insein Prison to protest against their being issued \\"layperson\\" identification cards for the upcoming constitutional referendum. He was subsequently placed in solitary confinement. In speaking later of conditions in the prison, Gambira stated that he had malaria for seven of his eight months there. Tomas Ojea Quintana, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for Burma, visited Gambira and four other political prisoners at Insein in August. Gambira faced a total of sixteen charges for his role in the protests, including membership in an unlawful association and illegal movement across borders. In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying that the military government would not allow him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the trial of a forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism. In November, Gambira was sentenced to 68 years in prison, at least 12 years of which would be hard labour. In early 2009, five years were taken off his total sentence, reducing it to 63 years. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International protested his sentence, calling for his immediate release. Aung Ko Ko Lwin, Gambira's brother who had sheltered him from authorities, was sentenced to twenty years in prison, and Moe Htet Hlyan, Gambira's brother-in-law, was also imprisoned. Aung Ko Ko Lwin and Moe Htet Hlyan were sent to Arakan State and Mon State, respectively, to serve their sentences. Gambira was transferred to a labour camp in Sagaing Region. When his mother visited him in early 2009, she reported that he was on hunger strike, refusing to eat in protest of the conditions of his confinement. Amnesty International reported that he suffered from nervous tension and was in generally ill health. On 31 October 2011, the organisation issued an \\"urgent action\\" identifying Gambira as a prisoner of conscience and stating that he was being denied hospitalisation necessary to treat complications from being tortured at Hkamti prison in April 2009. Democratic Voice of Burma reported that Gambira was being regularly beaten by guards during the same period and was having seizures as a result. During his imprisonment, Gambira won the Bindmans Law and Campaigning Award in absentia at the 2008 Index on Censorship Freedom of Expression Awards. The prize recognises \\"lawyers and campaigners who have fought repression or who have struggled to change political climates and perceptions, especially those who have used or established legal means to fight injustice in the field of freedom of expression\\", and is sponsored by Bindmans LLP. Also in 2008, the official website of Morbegno, Italy announced that Gambira had been made an honorary citizen of the town.  2012 release and re-arrests  On 13 January 2012, Gambira was released in a mass presidential pardon of political prisoners that also included 88 Generation activists Min Ko Naing, Htay Kywe, and Nilar Thein, as well as Shan leader Khun Htun Oo. Gambira stated in an interview that his imprisonment had left him with depression, frequent headaches, and failing memory; however, he said he had difficulty finding a doctor willing to treat him, for fear that it would draw government reprisals. He attempted to leave the country for treatment, but could not get the necessary paperwork. Gambira told reporters that his organisation would continue to boycott the government despite the amnesty: \\"The government has transformed its external appearance into a civilian one but their efforts to implement democracy are still rather weak, while many cases of human rights violations continue\\". Gambira greets Finnish International Development Minister Heidi Hautala in Yangon, Burma on 22 January 2013 After breaking into and reopening several monasteries closed during the Saffron Revolution, Gambira was rearrested on 10 February during a 2 a.m. raid, and was released after a night in jail. Authorities announced that he was undergoing investigation for illegally squatting at the Maggin Monastery in Yangon's Thingangyun Township without officially registering with the Ministry of Religious Affairs after his release, and for breaking and entering the Sasana Theikpan and Sasana Gonyi Monasteries in Bahan Township. On 6 March 2012, he was once again detained and interrogated over a recent visit he had made to Kachin State, where local ethnic minority groups were engaged in guerrilla warfare against the government. He was released two days later. The following month, he was forced to formally cease to be a monk after several monasteries refused him membership, which he said was due to their fear of government reprisals if they were to allow him to enter. He then returned to his birth name of Nyi Nyi Lwin. In November 2012, Gambira was seated in the front row for a speech by visiting US President Barack Obama, who cautiously praised seeming democratic reforms including the release of political prisoners like Gambira. A few weeks after the speech, authorities arrested Gambira again and sent him to Insein prison. The US Embassy released a statement on the arrest, saying, \\"We're monitoring reports of U Gambira's detention. We urged the government of Burma to be fully transparent and follow due process of law\\". Gambira's family believed that he had been arrested to prevent him from joining protests by a group of monks against a copper mining project. On 11 December, Gambira was released on a bail of 4 million kyat (US$4,686). On 19 January 2016, he was arrested in Mandalay on a politically motivated charge of illegal border crossing. He was sentenced without evidence to 6 months in prison. The Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said that the deprivation of liberty of Gambira was arbitrary, being in contravention with Articles 10 and 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; it falls within category II of the categories applicable to the consideration of the cases submitted to the Working Group.Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention/ Gambira / 2016 / https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Detention/Opinions/Session76/33-2016.pdf He was released on 1 July 2016. Personal life Gambira, who is no longer a monk, has been living in Thailand after being re-arrested several times in 2012, and married to Marie Siochana since 2013, an Australian citizen.

Evolutionary significance Sexologist Alfred Kinsey suggested that the buttocks is the primary sexual presentation site in primates. Some anthropologists and sociobiologists believe that breast fetishism derives from the breasts' similarity to buttocks, but instead provide sexual attraction from the front of the body. In humans, females generally have more round and voluptuous buttocks, caused by estrogen that encourages the body to store fat in the buttocks, hips, and thighs. Testosterone discourages fat storage in these areas. The buttocks in human females thus contain more adipose tissue than in males, especially after puberty. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that rounded buttocks may have evolved as a desirable trait because they provide a visual indication of the woman's youth and fertility. They signal the presence of estrogen and the presence of sufficient fat stores for pregnancy and lactation. Additionally, the buttocks give an indication of the shape and size of the pelvis, which impacts reproductive capability. Since development and pronunciation of the buttocks begins at menarche and declines with age, full buttocks are also a symbol of youth. Biological anthropologist Helen B. Fisher said that \\"perhaps, the fleshy, rounded buttocks attracted males during rear-entry intercourse\\". In a recent study, using 3D models and eye-tracking technology Fisher's claim was tested and was shown that the slight thrusting out of a woman's back influence how attractive others perceive her to be and captures the gaze of both men and women. Bobbi S. Low et al. said that the female buttocks \\"evolved in the context of females competing for the attention and parental commitment of powerful resource- controlling males\\" as an \\"honest display of fat reserves\\" that could not be confused with another type of tissue, although T. M. Caro rejected that as being a necessary conclusion, stating that female fatty deposits on the hips improve individual fitness of the female, regardless of sexual selection. History spanking erotica Venus Kallipygos, a Roman sculpture (thought to be based on a Greek original) that emphasizes the buttocks The female buttocks have been a symbol of fertility and beauty since early human history. Statues created as early as 24,000 BC, such as the Venus of Willendorf, have exaggerated buttocks, hips, and thighs. The erotic beauty of the female buttocks was important to the ancient Greeks, thought to have built such statues as Venus Kallipygos (although only a possible Roman copy survives), that emphasize the buttocks. Bare buttocks were also considered erotic in Ming China, where they were often compared to the bright full moon. Many artists pose models to emphasize the buttocks. The buttocks have been considered an erogenous zone in Western thought for centuries; the eroticization of the female buttocks was due to their association and closeness to the female reproductive organs. The buttocks are often taboo due to their proximity to the anus and association with the excretory system. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud theorized that psychosexual development occurred in three stages‚Äîoral, anal, and genital‚Äîand that fixation in the anal stage caused anal retentiveness and a lasting focus on eroticization of the anus. Spanking was prominent in pornography in Victorian Britain with erotica such as Lady Bumtickler's Revels and Exhibition of Female Flagellants being consumed. In Studies in the Psychology of Sex, published in 1927 and written by British physician and sexual psychologist Havelock Ellis, he describes cultural sexual characteristics of the buttocks. He says: He adds that Ellis also claims that corsets and bustles are meant to emphasize the buttocks. Emphasis on the female buttocks as a sexual characteristic has increased in recent times according to Ray B. Browne, who attributes the change to the popularization of denim jeans: Males One of Wilhelm von Gloeden's male nudes emphasizing the buttocks. While female buttocks are often eroticized in heterosexual erotica, men's buttocks are considered erogenous by many women, and are also eroticized in male homosexuality which often centres on anal intercourse.Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body, page 61.Anal Pleasure & Health: A Guide for Men, Women and Couples, Jack Morin, Jack Morin Ph.

Fetishism A buttocks fetish or buttocks partialism refers to a condition wherein the buttocks becomes a primary focus of sexual attention. It may be associated with coprophilia, panty fetishism, eproctophilia, and sadomasochistic corporal punishment involving the buttocks. Pygophilia refers to sexual arousal caused by the buttocks.

Common chokeholds in grappling used to accomplish a choke-out include the rear naked choke, arm triangle, triangle choke, and the guillotine. The mechanics behind choke-outs are disputed. It has been explained as resulting from directly constraining blood flow to the brain. A competing theory involves compression of the baroreceptors of the carotid artery, confusing the body into thinking blood pressure has risen. Due to the baroreflex, this causes vasodilation, or widening of the brain's blood vessels intended to relieve high pressure. Since no blood pressure increase has actually occurred, the dilation causes a dramatic decrease in blood pressure to the brain, or brain ischemia, which then causes loss of consciousness. Choke-outs should not be confused with erotic asphyxiation or the fainting game, wherein a person loses consciousness intentionally in order to experience a particular sensation. A choke-out should also not be confused with medical conditions that cause fainting without the application of a chokehold.  Mechanics  The vulnerable carotid artery, (large, red tube), and the vagus nerve running parallel on its left Chokeholds can be divided into two primary categories: \\"blood chokes\\" and \\"air chokes\\". A blood choke disrupts blood circulation to the brain, while an air choke disrupts breathing. Blood chokes can be applied to efficiently cause loss of consciousness, i.e. a choke-out, while air chokes do not usually cause loss of consciousness without prolonged application (though air chokes are used to cause discomfort). Blood chokes constrain or disrupt blood circulation to the brain. This is accomplished by compressing one or both of the carotid arteries and/or the jugular veins, ideally with little to no pressure applied to the airway. One theory on the mechanics of choke-outs claims that unconsciousness results from the direct constraint of blood flow to the brain, causing cerebral hypoxia.  Dangers  There is debate over the dangers of choke- outs. After 4 to 6 minutes of sustained cerebral anoxia, permanent brain damage will begin to occur, but the long-term effects of a controlled choke- out for less than 4 minutes (as most are applied for mere seconds and released when unconsciousness is achieved) are disputed. There is always risk of short- term memory loss, hemorrhage and harm to the retina, concussions from falling when unconscious, stroke, seizures, permanent brain damage, coma, and even death. Some argue that when pressure is applied to the carotid artery, the baroreceptors send a signal to the brain via the glossopharyngeal nerveCONSTANTINOS H. DAVOS, LEWIS CERI DAVIES, MASSIMO PIEPOLI. The Effect of Baroreceptor Activity on Cardiovascular Regulation. Hellenic J Cardiol 43: 145-155, 2002. Retrieved from and the heart via the vagus nerve. This signal tells the heart to reduce volume of blood per heartbeat, typically up to one- third, in order to further relieve high pressure. There is a slight chance of the rate dropping to zero, or flatline (asystole). However, there are several studies that showed choking out will result in a few seconds of flat line ECG for a few seconds at least in half of the subjects. This might suggest that choking out or syncope is not as safe as it was assumed to be previously. Some argue that with thousands of tournaments since the sport of Judo began in 1882, hundreds of thousands of chokes have been applied, and the probability of hundreds if not thousands of choke-outs, with no reported deaths due to chokes, the chances of asystole are slim. It might be true that no direct death has reported as a result of chokes but there are numerous reports of these chokes turned out to strokes leaving the subject with permanent brain damage or possible more elaborated long-term effects  Effects  The American Neurological Association's study entitled ‚ÄúSyncope: A videometric analysis of 56 episodes of transient cerebral hypoxia‚Äù observed the effects of cerebral hypoxia on 42 test subjects who completely lost consciousness. Their syncope state lasted 12.1 seconds, plus or minus 4.4 seconds. Muscle jerks occurred in 90% of patients. The most common pattern of movement consisted of multifocal arrhythmic jerks (uncoordinated spasms of multiple muscle groups) in both proximal and distal muscles. Additional movements also occurred such as: righting movements (if the patient had slumped one way while falling asleep they woke up and immediately corrected, if not overcorrected), oral automatisms, and head turns. In most of the patients their eyes remained open. Sixty percent of the patients reported having visual and auditory hallucinations.

It is used to check if the actual execution of a business process, as recorded in the event log, conforms to the model and vice versa. For instance, there may be a process model indicating that purchase orders of more than one million euros require two checks. Analysis of the event log will show whether this rule is followed or not. Another example is the checking of the so-called ‚Äúfour-eyes‚Äù principle stating that particular activities should not be executed by one and the same person. By scanning the event log using a model specifying these requirements, one can discover potential cases of fraud. Hence, conformance checking may be used to detect, locate and explain deviations, and to measure the severity of these deviations. Overview Conformance checking techniques take as input a process model and event log and return a set of differences between the behavior captured in the process model and the behavior captured in the event log. These differences may be represented visually (e.g. overlaid on top of the process model) or textually as lists of natural language statements (e.g., activity x is executed multiple times in the log, but this is not allowed according to the model). Some techniques may also produce a normalized measures (between 0 and 1) indicating to what extent the process model and the event log match each other. The interpretation of non-conformance depends on the purpose of the model: * If the model is intended to be descriptive, discrepancies between model and log indicate that the model needs to be improved to capture reality better. * If the model is normative, then such discrepancies may be interpreted in two ways: they may expose undesirable deviations (i.e., conformance checking signals the need for a better control of the process). or may reveal desirable deviations (i.e., workers may deviate to serve the customers better or to handle circumstances not foreseen by the process model). Techniques The purpose of conformance checking is to identify two types of discrepancies: * Unfitting log behavior: behavior observed in the log that is not allowed by the model. * Additional model behavior: behavior allowed in the model but never observed in the log. There are broadly three families of techniques for detecting unfitting log behavior: replay, trace alignment and behavioral alignment. In replay techniques, each trace is replayed against the process model one event at a time. When a replay error is detected, it is reported and a local correction is made to resume the replay procedure. The local correction may be for example to skip/ignore a task in the process model or to skip/ignore an event in the log. A general limitation of replay methods is that error recovery is performed locally each time that an error is encountered. Hence, these methods might not identify the minimum number of errors that can explain the unfitting log behavior. This limitation is addressed by trace alignment techniques. These latter techniques identify, for each trace in the log, the closest corresponding trace that can be parsed by the model. Trace alignment techniques also compute an alignment showing the points of divergence between these two traces. The output is a set of pairs of aligned traces. Each pair shows a trace in the log that does not match exactly a trace in the model, together with the corresponding closest trace(s) produced by the model. Trace alignment techniques do not explicitly handle concurrent tasks nor cyclic behavior (repetition of tasks). If for example four tasks can occur only in a fixed order in the process model (e.g. [A, B, C, D]), but they can occur concurrently in the log (i.e. in any order), this difference cannot directly detected by trace alignment, because it cannot be observed at the level of individual traces. This limitation is addressed by behavioral alignment techniques These techniques compute an alignment between the state space of the process captured by the model against the state space of the process recorded in the log, and detect states where a task or behavioral relation occur in the model but not in the log. These techniques can hence detect both unfitting behavior and additional behavior. Other methods to identify additional behavior are based on negative events . These methods start by enhancing the traces in the log by inserting fake (negative) events in all or some traces of the log. A negative event is inserted after a given prefix of a trace if this event is never observed preceded by that prefix anywhere in the log. For example, if event C is never observed after prefix AB, then C can be inserted as a negative event after AB.

It is widely considered one of the best examples of early modern Indonesian literature.  Background  Salah Asuhan was written during the colonial period and published by Balai Pustaka, which published books \\"suitable for native Indonesian reading.\\" In order to be published, books had to avoid themes of rebellion and use formal Malay. As such, Salah Asuhan had to be rewritten with the European characters shown in a positive light after Balai Pustaka refused to publish it.  Plot  The story revolves around the Minangkabau Hanafi and his friend, the half-French half-Minangkabau Corrie du Buss√©e. Although Hanafi is Minangkabau and a Muslim, he considers European culture to be superior and has many European friends. After graduating from high school in Solok, Hanafi admits his love to Corrie and kisses her. However, Corrie feels ashamed afterwards and eventually flees to Batavia (Jakarta), leaving a letter for Hanafi saying that they can never be together because he is pribumi. Hanafi is then married to his cousin Rapiah, much to his discontent. He begins taking out his anger on his family, especially Rapiah. After a few years, Hanafi's European friends have left him because of his treatment of his family, including his and Rapiah's baby son. His temperament becomes worse as a result. One day, he is bitten by a rabid dog. He is sent for treatment in Batavia. Upon arrival in Batavia, Hanafi meets Corrie again and they fall in love. They eventually marry and move in together. Hanafi finds employment with the Dutch colonial government, receives the same legal status as a European, and adopts the Christian name Chrisye. He does not think of his family in Solok, even though they are worried about him. Although their married life starts well, eventually Hanafi becomes abusive towards Corrie. Upon hearing that Corrie has befriended a disreputable woman and occasionally meets other men without him knowing, Hanafi loses his temper, accuses Corrie of infidelity and hits her. Corrie runs away from home and eventually starts working at an orphanage in Semarang. Hanafi's coworkers in Batavia ostracise him after hearing of his treatment of Corrie. After one tells him that he is seen to be acting poorly, Hanafi realizes that he was wrong and goes to Semarang to apologize to Corrie. However, upon arrival he finds her dying of cholera. Corrie forgives him, and dies. Hanafi then collapses from the stress. After being treated, Hanafi returns to his village to be with his family. Not long after his arrival, he commits suicide by drinking poison and apologizes to his family on his deathbed, embracing his Minangkabau and Muslim heritage. Rapiah states that she will not raise their son to be like the Europeans.  Themes  Salah Asuhan is generally seen as a warning against excessive Westernization. The failure of the marriage between Hanafi and Corrie is presented as being caused by Hanafi's refusal to follow Minangkabau traditions and aspiring to be more than a pribumi. Hanafi's admiration for European culture and lack of understanding of his own causes him to berate and demean his family, while his inability to live up to those ideals ultimately causes his relationship with Corrie to dissolve.  Reception  Salah Asuhan is generally considered one of the most important works in modern Indonesian Literature and is commonly used as reading material in Indonesian literature classes. Bakri Siregar wrote positively of Salah Asuhan, considering the diction unparalleled in its contemporaries and the characters well fleshed-out. A. Teeuw considered Salah Asuhan one of the three most important pre-war novels. He wrote that the unprecedented frank depiction of racism and social ostracism was tempered by the simple writing style to the point that it could be enjoyed not only as a piece of literature, but also as a love story.A. Teeuw. Sastra Baru Indonesia. 1978. Nusa Indah: Ende. In Indonesian. pp. 93‚Äì95.  In popular culture  Salah Asuhan was made into a film of the same name in 1972 by Asrul Sani.

The vine produces fleshy leaves up to 3 centimeters long and star- shaped white flowers.J. reclinata. Center for Plant Conservation. The plant grows on barrier islands, where it can be found in several types of habitat, such as sand dunes and tropical hardwood hammocks. It grows in sunny open and disturbed areas, bare patches historically created by hurricanes and today sometimes created by human activity. Other plants growing in this type of habitat include seagrape (Coccoloba uvifera) and Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus). In 2001 there were ten known populations of this plant for a total of about 733 individuals. In 2007 it was estimated that the total population had decreased 13% since the year 2000.USFWS. J. reclinata Five-year Review. May 2007. The species is present in Broward, Palm Beach, and Dade Counties. It was known from Martin County but it is thought to be extirpated there. The coastal strips of these counties are heavily populated and constantly expanding, leading to the consumption of natural habitat for residential, commercial, and other uses. Remaining occurrences of the plant are on land that is fragmented and degraded. It is invaded by introduced plant species such as Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius).

Emde did his missionary work by asking children to spread the Gospel of Mark as translated by Bruchner to literate people at the markets. This gospel was widely discussed because of how different it was from other religious texts available at the time. Emde also taught the people of Surabaya about Christianity and how Christians had to be baptised, which had not been taught by Coenrad Laurens Coolen, a previous missionary.

Founded by Pranav Ashar in 2006, the group operates through two related but legally distinct operations: a Film Society structured as a non-profit organization and a DVD label structured as a private limited company. History In 2006, Pranav Ashar, then an 18-year-old student at University of Mumbai, decided to start a film society that would show film classics on the big screen. He was particularly passionate about world cinema and was actively involved with the Mithibai College Film Society. He saw starting a broader film society as a way to share his passion with more likeminded individuals. Thus, Enlighten Film Society started with two screens at Cinemax, which the owners graciously allowed them to use for a nominal fee early on a Sunday morning. In 2008, Enlighten sensed that the market was ripe for a DVD label focused on introducing world cinema to India. They tested the market with nine titles in 2008, leveraging their contacts from the film society and building their own distribution capability to get it done right (instead of tying up with an existing player in the market). After improving upon this effort and ultimately meeting with success, they increased the number of titles in 2009 and even further in 2010. Enlighten Film Society Enlighten Film Society, has 10,000 members across the country and has recently been certified as India‚Äôs largest film society by Federation of Film Societies of India. They charge the members a fixed annual amount (currently Rs. 2,000, inclusive of service tax, up from Rs. 1,500 three years ago) to be a member of our film society. In return, members get a card that entitles them to gain entrance to any of their weekly film screenings, at which they showcase a carefully chosen eclectic blend of the finest in world cinema. The screenings are announced in advance via newspaper ads, SMS, email, and the Enlighten website. Members can come as often as they wish, up to the maximum possible of 50 screenings per year. Additionally, they also organize exclusive events and talks with leading talents of Indian cinema like Anurag Kashyap, Amitabh Bachchan, and Shabana Azmi. They regularly organize, film festivals occasionally focusing on a particular country in a bid to increase the understanding about different cultures. Retrospective of great film makers is another constant practice at Enlighten. Prominent film personalities who have spoken at Enlighten screenings include Anurag Kashyap, Saif Ali Khan, Imtiaz Ali, Javed Akhtar, Sudhir Mishra, Ketan Mehta, Waheeda Rehman, Sriram Raghavan, Amitabh Bachchan, Siddiq Barmak, Sujoy Ghosh, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha, Shabana Azmi, Vivek Agnihotri, and Farhan Akhtar. They have also hosted various award-winning filmmakers from countries like Italy, France, Germany, Russia, Iran, China, Indonesia, the US, Turkey, and Argentina. Another first by Enlighten Film Society, was establishing the World Cinema Day, celebrated on 13 April every year. Today, Taj Enlighten Film Society operates in 5 theatre screens across 4 Indian cities: Mumbai (2 screens), Delhi (1 screen), Bangalore (1 screen), and Surat (1 screen). They will soon be expanding to other major cities like Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad, and Chennai. They also manage programming for numerous smaller film societies across India, many of whom are more niche in nature or at smaller venues. Currently they manage programming for 37 such film societies across India and by the end of the calendar year they plan to help and collaborate with 150 film societies, possibly re-branding some of these under the \\"Enlighten\\" name. =Enlighten Award= Enlighten Film Society confers the prestigious Enlighten Award to leading talents of Indian Cinema. Amitabh Bachchan, Javed Akhtar, Mrinal Sen and Shabana Azmi are some of the recipients of this honour. Enlighten Films DVD label In 2008, Enlighten launched a DVD label focused on world cinema. Enlighten tested the market in a low risk way with nine classic titles from the 1930s and 1940s. They currently have a library of about 150 titles, including not just films but also certain TV serials (e.g. Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs Fauji) under the label ‚ÄòThe Golden Age of Television'. Enlighten have built their own distribution capability rather than tying up with an existing player in the market. They have expanded distribution across all of India, selling directly to retail chains and relying on regional distributors to reach non- chain retailers. Enlighten Film posters In the bid to expand into other complementary film-related areas, Enlighten intends to venture into the distribution of film posters. Enlighten has assembled the largest library of posters in India, and we will start selling copies of these posters via retailers in 2011.

The ihtisab seems to mainly have been a \\"daily opening tax\\", where Shopkeepers would pay each day their shop was open (paying nothing if their shop was closed).Kaya, M.ƒ∞., 2006. Shops and shopkeepers in the ƒ∞stanbul ƒ∞htisab register of 1092/1681 (Doctoral dissertation, Bilkent University). p.12 It was seen as a source of substantial income; people would \\"buy\\" the position of ihtisap aƒüasi from the bey, in order to collect the market tax. This was a form of tax farming, parallel to iltizam and the earlier establishment of feudal monopolies to collect revenue from other economic activity, such as salt production. Hence the only people who became muhtasibs were those who could afford to buy their way into the sinecure. In the later empire, damga resmi (a charge on hallmarks, and stamp duty) was considered to be part of ihtisab. In the early 19th century, before the tanzimat reforms, the difficulty of enforcing ihtisab led the Ottoman government to establish a series of monopolies, called ved-i vahit, to ease collection Ihtisab was eventually replaced by temettu vergisi, a tax on merchants' profits, which was introduced as part of the tanzimat-era tax reforms in 1839. Mahmut II aimed to create a fairer system of taxes based on ability to pay, and which was based on an extensive census across the empire in the 1830s. The new taxes were first introduced in Bursa and Gallipoli before rollout across the rest of the empire; temettu vergisi was enforced by muhassils, who were salaried government officers rather than feudal lords, although the title ihtisap aƒüasi was retained; their role in the regulation of commerce evolved into that of a municipal official.

Common side effects include dizziness, back pain, and upper respiratory tract infections. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, kidney problems, allergic reactions, and electrolyte problems. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. Losartan works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II while hydrochlorothiazide works by decreasing the ability of the kidneys to absorb electrolytes. Interactions include with lithium, agents which increase potassium, and NSAIDs. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 1.50 ¬£ per month as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$2.50. In 2017, it was the 67th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than eleven million prescriptions. Medical uses It is used for high blood pressure (hypertension) once a day. Based on the initial blood pressure response and/or losartan-hydrochlorothiazide side effects, the dosage may be increased or decreased. With each change in dosage, it may take up to a month to see the full effect.  Side Effects  Common side effects include dizziness, headache, back pain, rash, fever, diarrhea, cough, and upper respiratory tract infections. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, kidney problems, allergic reactions, and electrolyte problems. Drug interactions Drug interactions to be aware of include lithium, agents increasing serum levels of potassium, and the use of hydrochlorothiazide with antidiabetic drugs both oral agents and insulin.  Mechanisms  Losartan works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II by preventing it from binding to the angiotensin I receptor while hydrochlorothiazide works by decreasing the ability of the kidneys to absorb electrolytes. The effects of hydrochlorothiazide indirectly lower the levels of serum potassium. However, with coadministration of losartan which is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, the low levels of potassium are reversed. Brand names The losartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination preparation is marketed by Merck under the trade name Hyzaar and by Xeno Pharmaceuticals under the name Anzaplus. Merck, Sharp & Dohme market it as Ocsaar Plus in Israel. It is marketed as Cozaar comp in Sweden and South Africa.

The company archives are deemed a valuable cultural asset and were provided with legal protection. Original Hellerau workshops Company history The workshops were founded October 1, 1898 by Karl Schmidt-Hellerau (1873-1948) under the name Dresdner Werkst√§tten f√ºr Handwerkskunst Schmidt und Engelbrecht, or Schmidt and Engelbrecht Dresdner workshops for craftsmanship. His partner In 1898-1899 Karl Schmidt-Hellerau and Johann Vincenz Cissarz developed a closet using plywood panels. They continued developing the technique of using plywood. In 1941 they received a patent for thermally tempered wood. In 1907, Karl Schmidt-Hellerau established an industrial technical school and training workshops. Its first head was Joseph August Lux. The cornerstone of a new factory was laid in 1909 in what is today Dresden-Hellerau at the same time as work began on the garden city of Hellerau. Following the commissioning of the new production hall, the company moved there in 1910. At the time the firm occupied 450 employees. Despite the severe global economic crisis in 1929, the years of National Socialism and the devastation of the Second World War and the socialist planned economy in the GDR, the company has endured. In 1967 the workshops began mass production of the M√∂belprogramm Deutsche Werkst√§tten (MDW), a modular system developed by Rudolf Horn which remained in production for 24 years. Starting in 1970 Hellerau was the main plant of the Volkseigener Betrieb M√∂belkombinat Hellerau, an industrial grouping of furniture producers of East Germany. Following reunification in 1991, the company was transformed into a GmbH in 1992 and privatized by the Treuhand. It then employed 80 people, with a focus on fulfilling public sector procurement. DWH wall units displayed at the Leipzig Trade Fair, 1974 At the beginning of the 21st century, Deutsche Werkst√§tten Hellerau employed over 200 people worldwide, with foreign subsidiaries and sales representatives in England and France. Social Commitment During his years in England, Karl Schmidt-Hellerau became familiar with the idea of the garden city. In reaction to the conditions of worker's housing in Dresden, he decided together with other people, among them Friedrich Naumann, to build Germany's first garden city. This was accomplished in 1909.

She is currently the Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). She was previously the Head of Science in Society at ICSU, the International Council for Science, and the Executive Director of DIVERSITAS, the international scientific programme dedicated to biodiversity science, under the auspices of ICSU, and UNESCO.  Studies  Anne Larigauderie received her Master's Degree in plant molecular biology from the Universit√© Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France, and her PhD in plant ecology, from the Universit√© des Sciences et Techniques du Languedoc and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) in Montpellier, France. She then spent several years in the USA, working as a research scientist in several scientific projects. In Alaska, for example, she was involved in the first pilot project performing CO2 enrichment of natural ecosystems in the tundra in open top chambers (with Prof. Walter C. Oechel) to understand and predict impact of climate change on plant physiology and ecology. In California (San Diego State University and the University of California ‚Äì Davis) she worked on root competition among California grassland species for soil nutrient pockets (with Prof. Jim Richards). A subsequent project focused on responses of various grass species to various scenarios of elevated CO2 and temperature, the aim of which was to predict response of grasses to future climate change (with Prof. Boyd Strain and Prof. Jim Reynolds, Duke University, North Carolina).  Career  Dr. Larigauderie then returned to Europe, working as a research scientist on the potential acclimation of dark respiration of lowland and alpine plant species to future elevated temperatures (with Prof. Christian K√∂rner, University of Basel, Switzerland). In 1996 she became the coordinator of the Swiss Priority Programme on biodiversity, and the scientific adviser to the Swiss delegation to the Convention on Biological Diversity. In 1999, she joined the International Council for Science (ICSU, Paris), as Environmental Sciences Officer. She was appointed as Executive Director of DIVERSITAS late 2001. Her priorities have been to build DIVERSITAS as a strong international scientific programme dedicated, on one hand, to the sciences of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and, on the other hand, to strengthen the science-policy interface for biodiversity and ecosystem services. She has worked to facilitate, on behalf of the scientific community, the establishment of an IPCC-like mechanism for biodiversity, called IPBES, the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem services. In 2013, she became Head of Science in Society at ICSU, the International Council for Science. In 2010, she was made Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre national de la L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur by the French national Ministry of National Education, Advanced Instruction, and Research.

Generally, both taxes had to be paid, and the terms may at times have been interchangeable - taxation in the Ottoman empire was a complex patchwork of overlapping taxes which evolved over time. The amount of resm-i d√∂n√ºm was proportional to the size of the farm. In some cases, the resm-i d√∂n√ºm was specific to a kind of lease agreement that an otherwise landless peasant would make with a sipahi (feudal lord) and it may actually have resembled a rent more than a tax. Since the rate of resm-i d√∂n√ºm was recorded in tax codes such as kanunname, and the area of a d√∂n√ºm is known, tax documents which detail the amount of resm-i d√∂n√ºm paid by each community allow historians to understand the varying areas of land under cultivation at different times and in different provinces. One preserved kanunname, for the Morea in 1716, set resm-i d√∂n√ºm at 60 ak√ßes per √ßift, although the area of a √ßift would vary between provinces, and it was stated that the area of a √ßift was smaller for high-quality farmland than for low-quality farmland.

Life By 1760 Hutchinson was established as a solicitor in Barnard Castle, County Durham. He was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 15 February 1781, and communicated in November 1788 an 'Account of Antiquities in Lancashire' (Arch√¶ologia, ix. 211-18). Hutchinson died on 7 April 1814, having survived his wife only two or three days. He left three daughters and a son. Works In all his undertakings Hutchinson received assistance from George Allan. In 1785 he published the first volume of his History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham, Newcastle, founded on Allan's manuscript collections; the second volume appeared in 1787, and the third in 1794. His work was carried on while he was prosecuting a lawsuit with the publisher; being unable to find purchasers for the thousand copies which he printed, he disposed of four hundred to John Nichols. Another revised edition was issued at Durham in 1823 in 3 vols. George Allan and William Hutchinson (right), 1814 engraving by Joseph Collyer the Younger. Hutchinson's other topographical works are: * An Excursion to the Lakes in Westmoreland and Cumberland, August 1773 [anon.], 1774. * An Excursion to the Lakes in Westmoreland and Cumberland, with a Tour through part of the Northern Counties in 1773 and 1774, London, 1776. * A View of Northumberland, with an Excursion to the Abbey of Mailross in Scotland, 2 vols. * Newcastle, 1776-8. * 2 vols. He also edited anonymously Thomas Randal's State of the Churches under the Archdeaconry of Northumberland, and in Hexham Peculiar Jurisdiction (1779?). In 1788 he composed a tragedy called Pygmalion, King of Tyre, and soon afterwards another named The Tyrant of Orixa. Both plays were submitted to Thomas Harris, the manager of Covent Garden, but neither was acted or printed. A third play written by him, entitled The Princess of Zanfara, after being rejected by Harris, was printed anonymously in 1792, and frequently performed at provincial theatres. His other writings are: *The Hermitage; a British Story, 1772. *The Doubtful Marriage; a Narrative drawn from Characters in Real Life, 3 vols. 1775 (another edit., 1792). *The Spirit of Masonry, in Moral and Elucidatory Lectures, London, 1775 (other edits., 1796, 1802, and 1843, with notes by George Oliver). *A Week in a Cottage; a Pastoral Tale, 1776. *A Romance after the manner of The Castle of Otranto. *An Oration at the Dedication of Free Mason's Hall in Sunderland on the 16th July 1778. In 1776 Hutchinson edited a volume of Poetical Remains by his brother Robert, who had died in November 1773. It was printed at George Allan's private press at Darlington, which also put out many of Hutchinson's Addresses to his subscribers. He left in manuscript The Pilgrim of the Valley of Hecass; a Tale, and a volume of Letters addressed to the Minister, 1798, by, \\"Freeholder North of Trent\\". He had also prepared a copy of his History of Durham, corrected for a second edition, and a Poetical Sketch of his own life.  Freemasonry  He was initiated into Freemasonry on 4 June 1770 where he eventually became the Worshipful Master of Barnard Castle Lodge of Concord. He was also founding Master of Lodge No. 461 in Raby. His book, the Spirit of Masonry (1775), gained him the title of \\"father of masonic symbolism\\". The book received the sanction of the Grand Lodge of England and went through nine editions during his lifetime.

Project structure Open Compute V2 Server Open Compute V2 Drive Tray, 2nd lower tray extended The initiative was announced in April 2011 by Jonathan Heiliger at Facebook to openly share designs of data center products. The effort came out of a redesign of Facebook's data center in Prineville, Oregon. The Open Compute Project Foundation is a 501(c)(6) non-profit incorporated in the state of Delaware. Rocky Bullock serves as the Foundation's CEO and has a seat on the board of directors. As of July 2020, there are 7 members who serve on the board of directors which is made up of one individual member and six organizational members. Mark Roenigk (Facebook) is the Foundation's president and chairman. Andy Bechtolsheim is the individual member. In addition to Mark Roenigk who represents Facebook, other organizations on the Open Compute board of directors include Intel (Jason Waxman), Microsoft (Kushagra Vaid), Google (Partha Ranganathan), and Rackspace (Jim Hawkins). A current list of members can be found on the opencompute.org website.  OCP projects  The Open Compute Project Foundation maintains a number of OCP projects, such as: =Server designs = Two years after Open Compute Project had started, with regards to a more modular server design, it was admitted that \\"the new design is still a long way from live data centers\\". However, some aspects published were used in Facebook's Prineville data center to improve energy efficiency, as measured by the power usage effectiveness index defined by The Green Grid. (video archive) Efforts to advance server compute node designs included one for Intel processors and one for AMD processors. In 2013, Calxeda contributed a design with ARM architecture processors. Since then, several generations of OCP server designs have been deployed: Freedom (Intel), Spitfire (AMD), Windmill (Intel E5-2600), Watermark (AMD), Winterfell (Intel E5-2600 v2) and Leopard (Intel E5-2600 v3) =Data storage = Open Vault storage building blocks offer high disk densities, with 30 drives in a 2U Open Rack chassis designed for easy disk drive replacement. The 3.5 inch disks are stored in two drawers, five across and three deep in each drawer, with connections via serial attached SCSI. This storage is also called Knox, and there is also a cold storage variant where idle disks power down to reduce energy consumption. Another design concept was contributed by Hyve Solutions, a division of Synnex in 2012. At the OCP Summit 2016 Facebook together with Taiwanese ODM Wistron's spin-off Wiwynn introduced Lightning, a flexible NVMe JBOF (just a bunch of flash), based on the existing Open Vault (Knox) design. =Rack designs = The designs for a mechanical mounting system have been published, so that open racks have the same outside width (600 mm) and depth as standard 19-inch racks, but are designed to mount wider chassis with a 537 mm width (21 inches). This allows more equipment to fit in the same volume and improves air flow. Compute chassis sizes are defined in multiples of an OpenU, which is 48 mm, slightly taller than the typical 44mm rack unit. =Energy efficient data centers = The OCP has published data center designs for energy efficiency. These include power distribution at 277 VAC, which eliminates one transformer stage in typical data centers, a single voltage (12.5 VDC) power supply designed to work with 277 VAC input, and 48 VDC battery backup. =Open networking switches = On May 8, 2013, an effort to define an open network switch was announced. The plan was to allow Facebook to load its own operating system software onto the switch. Press reports predicted that more expensive and higher-performance switches would continue to be popular, while less expensive products treated more like a commodity (using the buzzword \\"top-of- rack\\") might adopt the proposal. The first attempt at an open networking switch by Facebook was designed together with Taiwanese ODM Accton using Broadcom Trident II chip and is called Wedge, the Linux OS that it runs is called FBOSS. Later switch contributions include \\"6-pack\\" and Wedge-100, based on Broadcom Tomahawk chips. Similar switch hardware designs have been contributed by: Edge-Core Networks Corporation (Accton spin-off), Mellanox Technologies, Interface Masters Technologies, Agema Systems. Capable of running Open Network Install Environment (ONIE)-compatible network operating systems such as Cumulus Linux, Switch Light OS by Big Switch Networks, or PICOS by Pica8. A similar project for a custom switch for the Google platform had been rumored, and evolved to use the OpenFlow protocol. Litigation In March, 2015, BladeRoom Group Limited and Bripco (UK) Limited sued Facebook, Emerson Electric Co. and others alleging that Facebook has disclosed BladeRoom and Bripco's trade secrets for prefabricated data centers in the Open Compute Project. Facebook petitioned for the lawsuit to be dismissed, but this was rejected in 2017. A confidential mid-trial settlement was agreed in April 2018.

Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that showed 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same title featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Gael Newton, Silver and Grey: Fifty Years of Australian Photography 1900‚Äì1950 (Angus & Robertson, 1980; )AGNSW website 6 Photographers, Art Gallery of New South WalesChristopher Allen, \\"Decisive Moments\\", The Australian, 27 February 2010 This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties). Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looked not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age ‚Äì the fifties, sixties and seventies. In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured \\"images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware\\". Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Christopher Allen, \\"Unguarded Moments\\", The Australian, 17 July 2010Patrick Emmett, \\"Candid Camera\\", ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (not all of whom were in office when photographed), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops. Photographers represented in Candid Camera *Max Dupain *David Moore *Jeff Carter *Max Pam *Robert McFarlane *Mervyn Bishop *Rennie Ellis *Carol Jerrems *Roger Scott All of these have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century in Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Julie Robinson, A Century in Focus: South Australian Photography 1840s‚Äì1940s (AGSA/Thames & Hudson. 2007; ) The Candid Camera exhibition and catalog both identified a number of different strands within Australian social documentary photography after the first generation ‚Äì new photojournalism in the sixties, and the more personal approaches taken in the seventies ‚Äì along with a number of themes in the subject matter: everyday life, the protest movements of the sixties, street photography and Australia's increasing engagement with Asia. Though Robert McFarlane, formerly photographic critic on the Sydney Morning Herald and one of the photographers included in the exhibition, agrees that the exhibition's time frame was \\"the great period of photo-journalism internationally\\", he also believes that \\"the importance of documentary photography has never been greater, because Australia is changing dramatically in terms of its work habits and its racial make-up, and politically it is changing as well.\\" In this, he echoes the original six photographers and their statement \\"Our manners, mode of living and appearance are changing more rapidly from year to year, and we feel the camera can and should be used to record this constant flux.\\"Six Photographers, exhibition catalog (Sydney 1955) Candid Camera was accompanied by a series of talks, a program of Australian films from the same era, and screenings of Girl in a Mirror, a Rose d'Or-winning documentary about Carol Jerrems, who died in 1980 at the age of 30.Media release, Art Gallery of South AustraliaDaniel Ziffer, \\"ABC Shows Bask in Glory\\", The Age, 1 May 2006  References  Social documentary photography Art museums and galleries in Australia Photography in Australia Photography exhibitions 2010 in art Exhibitions in Australia ","title":"Candid Camera (Australian photographic exhibition)"},{"id":"31547888","text":"Microwork is a series of small tasks which together comprise a large unified project, and are completed by many people over the Internet. Microwork is considered the smallest unit of work in a virtual assembly line. It is most often used to describe tasks for which no efficient algorithm has been devised, and require human intelligence to complete reliably. The term was developed in 2008 by Leila Chirayath Janah of Samasource. Microtasking Microtasking is the process of splitting a large job into small tasks that can be distributed, over the Internet, to many people. Since the inception of microwork, many online services have been developed that specialize in different types of microtasking. Most of them rely on a large, voluntary workforce composed of Internet users from around the world. Typical tasks offered are repetitive but not so simple that they can be automated. Good candidates for microtasks have the following characteristics:Crowdsourcing for Dummies by David Allan Grier, John Wiley & Sons, Mar 27, 2013 * They are large volume tasks * They can be broken down into tasks that are done independently * They require human judgement It may also be known as ubiquitous human computing or human-based computation when focused on computational tasks that are too complex for distributed computing. Microtasks are distinguished from macrotasks, which typically can be done independently. They require a fixed amount of time and they require a specialized skill. The wage paid can range from a few cents per task to hundreds of dollars per project.Jonathan Zittrain, \\"Work the New Digital Sweatshops\\". Newsweek, December 7, 2009. Examples Amazon Mechanical Turk allows workers to choose and perform simple tasks online, reporting directly through the platform to receive payments in exchange. A task can be as complex as algorithm writing or as simple as labelling photos or videos, describing products, or transcribing scanned documents. Employers submit tasks and set their own payments, which are often pennies for each task. This crowdsourcing project was initiated by Amazon as a way for users to find duplicate webpages, and soon it became a service for individuals to contract computer programmers and other individuals to finish tasks that computers are unable to accomplish. Since then this project has expanded from its original form; nowadays, there are people who will complete various Mechanical Turk projects as extra income on the side. LiveOps uses a distributed network of people to run a \\"Cloud Call Center\\", a virtual call center or contact center: contracted workers can answer calls and provide other call center facilities without the need for the physical building or equipment of a traditional call center. The Red Cross used this system successfully during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, to process 17,000+ calls without having to open or hire staff for a call center. A similar model is used by text message question-answering services like 63336. Researchers connect with the service at home and receive questions as they are submitted. InnoCentive allows businesses to post problems and offer payment for answers. These questions are often far less simple than tasks posted on services like Mechanical Turk, and the payments are accordingly higher. For example: \\"Think you can find a way to prevent orange juice stored in see-through bottles from turning brown? There may be $20,000 in it for you.\\" Samasource is a non-profit organization that allows people living in poverty the opportunity to complete microwork for a living wage.

These include driving traffic to websites, gathering data like email addresses or, and labelling or tagging data online. They are also used to accurately translate or transcribe audio clips and pictures, since these are activities that are better suited to humans than computers. These are used both for practical data conversion purposes, but also to improve upon and test the fidelity of machine learning algorithms. Identification of pictures by humans has been used to help in missing persons searches, though to little effect. Other than the manipulation of data, these services are also a good platform for reaching a large population for social studies and surveys since they make it easy to offer monetary incentives. Companies can also outsource projects to specialists on whom they otherwise would have expended more resources hiring and screening. This method of pay per task is attractive to employers; therefore, companies like Microsoft, AT&T;, Yahoo! are currently crowdsourcing some of their work through CrowdFlower, a company that specializes in allocating jobs for foreign and local crowd workers. CrowdFlower alone has completed 450 million completed human intelligence tasks between 2007 and 2012.Robert Munro, CTO of GVF. \\"CrowdFlower's Customers ‚Äî CrowdFlower\\". Crowdflower.com.

Nonetheless, a majority of the digital workforce is educated young adults. The major difference between the American and Indian workforce lies in the gender: 63% of Indian Turkers are male compared to the 37% that makes up American Turkers.Ross, J; Irani, L; Silberman, M.S.; Zaldivar, A; Tomlinson, B (2010). \\"Who are the Crowdworkers? Shifting Demographics in Mechanical Turk\\". CHI 2010. Reasons for using microwork services Microtasking services as they are implemented now allow their workers to work from home. Workers complete tasks on a voluntary basis; other than with time-sensitive jobs like call centers, they choose which jobs to complete and when they complete them. Workers can work from anywhere in the world and receive payment directly over the Internet. Because workers can reside anywhere in the world, microwork can provide job opportunities with large Fortune 500 companies and many smaller companies for people living in poverty who would otherwise not be able to make a living wage. Through services like Samasource work and wealth are distributed from companies in developed countries to a large volume of families in poverty, especially women and youth who would otherwise not be able to generate income. (Some services like Amazon Mechanical Turk, restrict the countries workers can connect from.) For employers, microtasking services provide a platform to quickly get a project online and start receiving results from many workers at the same time. The services offer large workforces which complete tasks concurrently, so large volumes of small tasks can be completed quickly.Lynch, A. (2012, December 08). Crowdsourcing is booming in asia. Retrieved from https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/08/asias-secret-crowdsourcing-boom/ Furthermore, since each task is discretely contained and tasks are usually simple in nature, each individual worker does not have to be fully trained or have complete knowledge of the project to contribute work. Under United States tax law, workers are treated as independent contractors, which means employers do not have to withhold taxes, and they only need to file a form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Service if a given worker earns more than $600 per year. Workers are responsible for paying income taxes, including self- employment tax that would otherwise be paid by their employer. Treatment of workers A small survey of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers found they think Mechanical Turk employers treat workers about as fairly as offline employers in their home country.John J. Horton, J. (2011). The condition of the turking class: Are online employers fair and honest?. Economics Letters, 111(1), 10-12.Amazon Mechanical Turk: The Digital Sweatshop Ellen Cushing Utne Reader January‚ÄìFebruary 2012: Microtasking services have been criticized for not providing healthcare and retirement benefits, sick pay, and minimum wage, because they pay by the piece and treat workers as independent contractors rather than employees. They can also avoid laws on child labor and labor rights. Additionally, workers may have little idea of what their work is used for. The result may be that workers end up contributing to a project which has some negative impact or which they are morally opposed to. Some services, especially Amazon Mechanical Turk and other services that pay pennies on the task, have been called \\"digital sweatshops\\" by analogy with sweatshops in the manufacturing industry that exploit workers and maintain poor conditions.Gillis, A. (2001), Digital sweatshops. This, 34, 6-6. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/203549187 Wages vary considerably depending on the speed of the worker and the per-piece price being offered. Workers choose what tasks they complete based on the task, price, and their experience with the employer. Employers can bid higher for faster completion or for higher-quality workers. On average, unskilled Turkers earn less than $2.00 an hour. This is below minimum wage in the United States; however, for India, this is well above the minimum for most cities (India has more than 1200 minimum wages).http://www.paycheck.in/main/salary/minimumwages Because global services outsource work to underdeveloped or developing regions, competitive pricing and task completion could result in the lower wages. The possibility also exists for true brick and mortar sweatshops to exploit microtasking services by enlisting those that are too poor to afford a computer of their own and aggregating their work and wages. There is also the possibility that the requesters may tell the worker that they reject the work but cheat the worker by using it anyway to avoid paying for it. However, while the dispersed geography of microwork can be used to keep wages low, the very networks that fragment the labour process can also be used by workers for organising and resistance. The San Francisco-based company CrowdFlower has facilitated outsourcing digital tasks to countries with poverty to stimulate their local economies. The crowdsourcing company has a partnership with Samasource, a non-profit organization that brings computer based work to developing countries, they have currently outsourced millions of repetitive microwork to the Kenyan refugee camps. These workers make $2 an hour; to the locals this is above average for refugees.Graham, F. (2010, October 21). Crowdsourcing work: Labour on demand or digital sweatshop?.

He states that the treatment received by the workers are far superior and should not be categorized as a sweatshop, \\"The great thing about digital work is it's really hard to make a sweatshop out of digital work. It's really hard to force someone to do work, you can't beat someone up through a computer screen.\\" See also * InnoCentive (company) * Human-based computation * Citizen science * Micro job * Crowdsourcing * CrowdFlower (company) * For the Win ‚Äî novel involving digital labour conflicts * List of crowdsourcing projects * Digital labor * Wages for housework * Online volunteering External links * Yandex.Toloka References Further reading *Zittrain, J (2008). \\"Ubiquitous human computing\\", Phil.

Eichardt‚Äôs is a significant local landmark, and is listed as a Category 2 historic place by the Historic Places Trust. Eichardt's building in Queenstown  History  William Gilbert Rees, one of the first Europeans to settle the Queenstown area, arrived at the shores of Lake Wakatipu in 1859, seeking pastoral land. Rees built a large hotel down on present day Frankton Road, a homestead on the lakefront and erected a woolshed on the site now occupied by Eichardt's Private Hotel. When gold was discovered in the nearby Shotover River in 1862, Rees found his high country station at the centre of a gold rush - his homestead was declared an official goldfield and the main business area of Queenstown developed around his station. An entrepreneurial Rees quickly turned to the hotel keeping business, his woolshed was given a wooden facade and turned into a hotel named the Queen's Arms. In early 1866, Rees entered into partnership with Albert Eichardt, who went on to become the sole proprietor of the hotel by 1869. Eichardt renamed the hotel Eichardt's Queen's Arms Hotel, it was renamed Eichardt's Hotel during his time.

Taxonomy The species was originally placed in the ant genus Camponotus when described in 2001 as Camponotus (Colobopsis) anderseni. In a revision of the ant subfamily Formicinae published in 2016 the subgenus C. (Colobopsis) found to be phylogenetically distinct from the other subgenera for Componotus. As a result, the subgenus was raised to full genus status as Colobopsis, with the species moved out of Camponotus, resulting in the new binomial Colobopsis anderseni. Description Colobopsis anderseni is light brown and glossy. Like any arthropod, its body contains three sections. The first part is called the prosoma while the middle part is called the mesosoma, and the posterior part is called the metasoma. The dorsum, or posterior side, of the mesosoma on C. anderseni is flattened. It also has distinct metanotum on the posterior of the thorax. It is lacking erect setae under its head, and its body is slightly raised on the tibiae, or fourth joint of each leg. Its eyes elongate looking outward, nearer to the mandibles than the vertex. It is dimorphic, meaning there are two separate forms based on class. In major workers, the clypeus is depressed and finely punctate. The anterior margin is convex. In minor workers, the clypeus is wide, and the anterior margin is convex and projecting. Geography Colobopsis anderseni has only been found in the mangroves of northern Australia. It is found exclusively in twigs of the mangrove tree Sonneratia alba. These trees can be found in the Kimberly region in the North Territory of Western Australia. According to recent studies, C. anderseni are the only species of ant known to live in the twigs of these trees, and recent studies showed that approximately 81% of the ant nests in the canopy of the mangrove tree Sonneratia alba were occupied by C. anderseni. The remaining nests were inhabited by three species of Tapinoma, two species of Crematogaster, Monomorium floricola, and Tetraponera punctulata. Ecology =Flooding in the mangroves= Some select species of ants live in the Australian mangroves because the advantage of living in a mangrove is less competition from other ants. Unfortunately, this is because the mangrove is considered to be highly undesirable by most ant species due to the two daily inundations. However, all mangrove ants have a remarkable ability that allows them to survive these floods which would otherwise exterminate all ant colonies in a single wave. All of these ants use some method to create a sealed pocket of air to protect from any water gathering inside the nest. To avoid drowning during high tide, some ants escape to higher parts of the trees, whereas others hide in air-filled cavities in the mangrove trees or in air pockets in the mangrove mud. These retreats have limited air volumes, and they are therefore subject to extreme changes in the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. This creates a problem when there are limited oxygen levels for large colonies. =Oxygen deprivation in nests= This problem was studied by a group of professors from the Department of Biological Science in the University of Aarhus, Denmark and the School of Science at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia. They studied Colobopsis anderseni in a series of experiments to determine varying carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in nests. During inundation, a soldier sacrifices herself to block the entrance hole with her head which effectively prevents flooding inside the nest. Once this occurs, the area can be very crowded, with the ants and coccids filling up to half the volume, and the conditions in the nests during a flood become hypercapnic and hypoxic. Each nest has only one entrance, and the opening is only about 1.56mm in diameter. The diameter of the galleries is only approximately 2.31 mm. During normal conditions with open nests, the oxygen depletion is substantial in the part of the nest most distant from the opening, and in a 120 mm long nest the oxygen concentration can be as low as 15.7%. During simulated inundation, in which the nest entrances were blocked, the oxygen concentration dropped to less than 0.5% after one hour. After opening the nest entrance, the oxygen concentration increased again, but for a 100 mm long nest it took nearly 20 minutes before the concentration was back to the normal depressed level. The dilemma faced by C. anderseni is to avoid drowning without suffering anoxia or hypercapnia, and they show a remarkable ability to adapt to the extreme conditions in the mangrove and exploit a niche where the density of other ants is insignificant. By adapting to these hostile situations, mangrove ants have developed the ability to switch to anaerobic respiration. This was proven by the observed oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Oxygen uptake in the nests eventually stopped, but the carbon dioxide production continued. This indicates high levels of anaerobic respiration. A similar study was conducted by Nielsen and other associates with another Australian mangrove ant, Polyrhachis sokolova. This mangrove species has been known to use the front four legs as oars and the back two legs as rudders in order to swim back to the nest directly before inundation. At this point, the ants retreat into their nest in the mud, which creates an air pocket and blocks out the incoming tide. The question was again raised about the ant's source of air, and the study on carbon dioxide levels in the nests of Polyrhachis sokolova was conducted. The experiment concluded with results similar to the study of C. anderseni nests with evidence that the ants had achieved anaerobic respiration. C. anderseni and the study involving this species have made significant contributions to the scientific community. This study alongside the study on Polyrhachis sokolova has supplied the only published work explaining the unique ability for mangrove ants to breathe anaerobically. Before these studies, there was no notable explanation among scientists for many ant species surviving in mangrove inundations. Queens and workers In another experiment by Morgens Gissel Nielsen, colonies of Colobopsis aderseni were observed and behaviors were recorded. New queens of C. anderseni were regularly observed gnawing small cavities in the green terminal shoots of Sonneratia trees, and this species occupied all of the examined terminal nest-cavities. It was thereby concluded that all ant galleries in Sonneratia branches are founded by this species. However the densities of these ants in Sonneratia trees differs greatly even in close vicinities because of the remote characteristics of these trees. The base of the Sonneratia trees is usually surrounded by sea water. Therefore, each tree functions as an island. After the queens have landed and lost their wings, they have very limited capacity for dispersal to neighboring trees. One of the notable observations in this study is that queens and workers of C. anderseni were never found in the same nest cavity. No queens were found in any of the 225 dissected nest chambers containing C. anderseni. In an additional 400 nests collected from other areas, queens were only found in the soft green shoots at the terminal ends of the branches of Sonneratia and were never together with workers. In the older nest chambers, workers were always present, regardless of the number of brood and alates. Furthermore, it was not possible the find an egg-laying queen in the main nest chambers of nests. Many believe that the only plausible explanation for the observed demographic variation in the nests of Colobopsis anderseni is to assume that the species has some form of thelytokous parthenogenesis, which is known from only very few species. This hypothesis is currently being tested with DNA micro satellite markers. Behavior Colobopsis anderseni workers of neighboring nests are known to be highly aggressive to each other. This was observed in a careful study from the University of Aarhus by watching neighboring ants in their environment as well as in a laboratory. When ants from different nests were placed together in a Petri dish, several began to fight. This indicates that nests represent separate colonies. Colony size Because each nest represents a separate colony, there are exceptionally small colonies, which are a clear adaptation to the high degree of environmental variability. A large colony requires either many small nest chambers or a few larger ones. The exchange between the many small chambers will increase the time the workers spend outside the nests and therefore also the degree of predation. More important for this species is the possibility of being washed away by the tide, waves or heavy rainstorms. Large nest cavities require very long hollowed twigs, which break easily during strong winds, potentially resulting in the ants being washed away. Larger cavities in thicker branches require the ants to excavate hard wood, which did not seem to be the case for this species. A more serious problem is the coccids, which primarily require cavities with a thin wall. Finally, a large cavity with several entrances and a large volume of air is much more difficult to keep waterproof during flooding. Diet Colobopsis anderseni are rarely seen foraging which has led scientists to believe that these ants rely on another food source. Due to the high numbers of coccids, their main food source is most likely honeydew. Very little is known about the dispersion of coccids to new chambers. It seems unlikely that the new queens transport coccids during nuptial flights, because no coccids are ever found in chambers less than 6 weeks old.

Technique Host recognition of bacteriophages occur via bacteria-binding proteins that have strong binding affinities to specific protein or carbohydrate structures on the surface of the bacterial host. Bacteria-binding proteins derived from bacteriophage coating paramagnetic beads will bind to specific cell components present on the surface of host thus capturing the cells and facilitate the concentration of these bead-attached cells.Kretzer JW, Lehmann R, Banz M, Kim KP, Korn C.

Bach composed the cantata for the third day of Easter in Leipzig and first performed it on 11 April 1724. He based it on his congratulatory cantata , first performed in K√∂then on 1 January 1719.  History and words  The cantata is Bach's second composition for Easter in Leipzig. On Easter Sunday of 1724, he had performed , from his time in M√ºhlhausen. On the second day of Easter, , which he had derived from the secular serenata , composed in K√∂then in 1718. In a similar way, he arranged a cantata for the New Year's Day of 1719 in K√∂then, , for the third day of Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Acts of the Apostles, the sermon of Paul in Antioch (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the appearance of Jesus to the Apostles in Jerusalem (). The unknown poet adapted the dialogues of the secular work of two allegorical figures, Time and Divine Providence, originally written by Christian Friedrich Hunold, one of the notable novelists of his time. In this cantata the poet kept the order of the movements, dropping movements 5 and 6 of the early work. He kept the final chorus as a conclusion, unlike , where it had been moved to the opening and replaced by a chorale. Bach simply wrote the new text below the former text in his score. Bach composed three new recitatives for a second version and first performed it on 27 March 1731. Bach revised the whole cantata, writing a new score with detailed improvements, possibly first performed on 12 April 1735.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for alto and tenor soloists, a four-part choir, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Recitative (alto, tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (alto, tenor): # Aria (alto, tenor): # Recitative (alto, tenor): # Chorus:  Recordings  * J.

The R√°ba has been building axles as well as complete vehicles since 1902. The company has three strategic business units. The company is headquartered in Gy≈ër, employing more than 2000 people. History The company was founded by local investor groups in Gy≈ër in 1896. In 1899, the R√°ba had started to export to foreign countries : it supplied railway passenger carriages to Egypt, the East Indies, Southern Africa, city tramcars to Amsterdam and Antwerp. The carriages of the London underground railway were constructed and manufactured in the R√°ba company. The London Underground Railway ordered 30 multiple-unit trains, 66 passenger cars for multiple-unit trains and bogies. In 1904, the production of the first petrol engine powered trucks started. In 1914, the company started to produce its first passenger automobiles: The R√ÅBA Alpha.

In the 1980s, R√°ba built no more than about 2,000 trucks per year, although it was Hungary's third biggest employer. Being an important provider to Hungarocamion, a publicly operated international trucking firm, helped raise their international profile. In 1985, R√°ba's business mostly consisted of engine and axle manufacturing, with only 15% of turnover being represented by trucks. Of these trucks, however, nearly 90 per cent were exported, with the lion's share going to Yugoslavia. In 1986, R√°ba introduced a more powerful, diesel engine (D11TLL) in order to help their trucks compete internationally and to meet Hungarocamion's needs. The new engine range was loosely based on the earlier MAN units, but were now of 11.05 litres, and were developed together with the Linz Institute of Graz, Austria.

Summary LQAS, sometimes called \\"acceptance sampling\\", involves taking a small random sample from each set of items in the population, and testing each sampled item to determine whether it meets a predetermined standard of quality. LQAS is functionally identical to stratified sampling (where each lot is a single stratum), but requires smaller samples because it does not attempt to construct a precise estimate of population parameters. Instead, after sampling, a researcher using LQAS performs a hypothesis test to determine whether the number of elements of interest in each lot (e.g. defective units in manufacturing, or persons with a particular medical condition in epidemiology) is likely to be greater than a predetermined threshold. Use LQAS was originally designed for use in manufacturing, where it provided a way to perform statistically valid quality- assurance testing at minimum cost. In the context of modern research, LQAS has become an accepted sampling method in the fields of public health and international development.

Active surveillance should not be confused with watchful waiting, another observational strategy for men that would not be candidates for curative therapy (surgery, radiation) because of a limited life expectancy. Active surveillance offers men with a prostate cancer that is thought to have a low risk of causing harm in the absence of treatment, a chance to delay or avoid aggressive treatment and its associated side effects. While prostate cancer is the most common non cutaneous cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men, it is conservatively estimated that approximately 100,000 men per year in the United States who would be eligible for conservative treatment through active surveillance, undergo unnecessary treatments. The management of localized prostate cancer is controversial and men with localized disease diagnosed today often undergo treatments with significant side effects that will not improve overall health outcomes. The 2011 NIH State-of-the-Science Conference Statement on the \\"Role of active surveillance in the management of men with localized prostate cancer\\" pointed out the many unanswered questions about observational strategies for prostate cancer that require further research and clarification. These included: * Improvements in the accuracy and consistency of pathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer * Consensus on which men are the most appropriate candidates for active surveillance * The optimal protocol for active surveillance and the potential for individualizing the approach based on clinical and patient factors * Optimal ways to communicate the option of active surveillance to patients * Methods to assist patient decision-making * Reasons for acceptance or rejection of active surveillance as a treatment strategy * Short- and long-term outcomes of active surveillance The consensus statement highlighted the need for well-designed studies to address these questions as an important health research priority. In the meantime, active surveillance for the treatment of low risk prostate cancer is now being offered to more and more patients where it is generally considered that prostate cancer will not cause the man harm during his lifetime if treatment is delayed or avoided. For these men, surveillance is thought to offer a more targeted approach to management; avoiding unnecessary treatment and its risk of associated side effects, while allowing for curative intervention for those that experience disease progression on observation.  History of prostate cancer in the era of prostate-specific antigens  Prostate-specific antigen based screening for prostate cancer led to earlier detection of prostate cancer (stage migration), and thus altered the course of the disease in the absence of treatment (natural history). Identifying the incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer increased with widespread prostate-specific antigen testing, as did the length of time that men live with their disease, as compared to the pre prostate-specific antigen era. The stage migration that occurred, with application of curative intervention at an earlier stage, undoubtedly led to a reduction inprostate cancer mortality. However, the extent to which this reduction was due to prostate-specific antigen based screening is debatable. Further, because prostate cancer progresses slowly and is found most often in older men with competing risks of mortality, the extent to which these changes in natural history have resulted in benefit and harm are also debatable. History of untreated prostate cancer The course of prostate cancer in the absence of treatment (natural history) has been evaluated both in observational studies and randomized trials. Most of the evidence on the outcomes of men that are not treated for prostate cancer comes from those diagnosed in the era prior to prostate cancer screening when the disease was diagnosed at a more advanced state. =Observational studies= The outcomes of men who are not treated for prostate cancer is dependent on cancer grade (the higher the grade the more aggressive), the life expectancy of the patient with the disease, and whether or not the cancer was detected through screening. Prostate cancers detected by PSA screening are detected at an earlier stage and generally take longer to progress without treatment, as compared to cancers detected because of physical findings (abnormal digital rectal examination) and/or symptoms. Thus, older men with a limited life expectancy, particularly if detected through screening, may not live long enough to be harmed by the cancer. The outcomes of men with moderately differentiated (Gleason scores 5-7) and poorly differentiated (Gleason scores 8-10) cancers managed without treatment (watchful waiting), was compared in the prostate cancer screening era (1992‚Äì2002) and pre prostate cancer screening era (prior to 1992). The rate of death from prostate cancer at 10 years for men age 65‚Äì74 years with moderately differentiated cancers (Gleason score 5-7) diagnosed with screening (in the prostate cancer screening era) and pre prostate cancer screening eras (without screening) were from 2-6%, and from 15-23%, respectively. For men with poorly differentiated cancers the 10-year cancer death rates in the prostate cancer screening and pre PSA eras was from 25-38% and from 50-66%, respectively. In a separate study of men from the pre prostate cancer screening era managed with watchful waiting (56% over age 70 years), progression to distant metastasis or prostate cancer death was 13.9% and 12.3%, respectively for Gleason score 6 or below, but considerably higher at 18.2 and 22.7%, 30% and 20%, 44.4% and 55.6% for Gleason 3+4, 4+3, and 8-10, respectively. It has been estimated that the 15 year rate of death from prostate cancers detected through screening would be 0-2% for men age 55‚Äì74 years with Gleason score 6 or less managed without treatment. These low grade prostate cancers make up 60-70% of the cancers found with prostate- specific antigen based screening. Thus, the pool of disease carrying a low risk of cancer related death without treatment over a 10-15 year period is large with prostate-specific antigen based screening. =Randomized studies= The control arm (untreated) of randomized trials comparing surgery to watchful waiting represents an opportunity for evaluating the natural history of prostate cancer. The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study-4 (SPGS-4) randomized 695 men (mean age 65 years) to observation versus radical prostatectomy; 5% were diagnosed through PSA based screening, 3 of 4 had palpable disease, and the mean PSA level was 13 ng/ml at diagnosis. Recognizing that these men differ from those diagnosed today with PSA screening, the cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer was 20.7% in the untreated group overall, and 11% for men with low risk disease (PSA below 10 ng/ml and Gleason score below 7) - similar to the cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer of 12.3% at 30 years for men with Gleason score 6 cancers managed conservatively in the Swedish observational study cited above. right The Prostate Cancer Intervention versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) randomized 731 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer to radical prostatectomy or observation (mean age 67 years; median PSA 7.8 ng/ml). In the observation group, bone metastases and prostate cancer death occurred in 10.6% and 8.4%, respectively through 12 years. Death from prostate cancer occurred in 5.7% and 17.4% of men diagnosed with Gleason score below 7 and 7 and above, respectively; and 6.2% and 12.8% of men with a PSA of 10 ng/ml or below and above 10 ng/ml, respectively. Stratified by D‚ÄôAmico risk groups (see Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification Table at right for explanation), death from prostate cancer occurred in 2.7%, 10.8%, and 17.5% of men with low, intermediate, and high risk disease, respectively. Recognizing that men in the PIVOT study were more likely to have been diagnosed as a result of PSA based testing as compared to men in the SPGS-4 who were not, it is of interest that cumulative deaths from prostate cancer in the SPGS-4 among men with low risk disease (11%) is comparable to that of men with intermediate risk disease (10.8%) in PIVOT. These data suggest that the outcomes for men with low risk disease in the pre PSA era are comparable with those of men today diagnosed with intermediate risk disease. Rationale for non-curative management of prostate cancer PSA based screening and treatment of prostate cancer at a localized stage can prevent prostate cancer death for some men. However, if curative intervention is the downstream consequence of every screen detected prostate cancer, a large proportion of men will undergo unnecessary treatment and experience functional declines in quality of life due to the side effects of treatment. = Functional outcomes and quality of life after treatment for localized prostate cancer = At 15 years after treatment (radiotherapy or surgery) of localized prostate cancer diagnosed in 1994-1995, declines in urinary, sexual, and bowel function were common. These functional declines in quality of life occur to a significantly greater extent among those that undergo treatment for prostate cancer as compared to a normative aging population without a diagnosis of prostate cancer, and symptom distress is more common among men with prostate cancer that are treated compared to those not treated. In a contemporary study of quality of life after treatment (radiotherapy and surgery) for localized prostate cancer, the authors reported that a substantial proportion of men did not return to baseline function in the domains of bowel, sexual, and urinary function; that changes in quality of life domains were treatment specific; and that patient and partner outcome satisfaction were closely associated with changes in quality of life after treatment. Thus, treatment for prostate cancer commonly results in quality of life changes that affect both the patient and his partner. = Risks of over treatment of prostate cancer = Over diagnosis is the detection of a cancer that would otherwise not have been diagnosed in the lifetime of the host if the detection test (e.g., PSA and/or prostate biopsy) had not been performed. Treatment of men who would otherwise not have known about their cancer in the absence of PSA testing and biopsy are over treated. Over treatment exacts a cost to the health care system and potential harm to a patient (decrease in quality of life), with no benefit. Over treatment is most likely to occur when a low grade prostate cancer is detected, especially in an older man. Data from various sources suggest that in the PSA range where many men are undergoing prostate biopsy today (PSA 2-4 ng/ml), 15-25% will have prostate cancer detected, and 80-90% will be low grade. The rate of overtreatment in the U.S. is similar to the rate of over diagnosis since the majority of men undergo curative intervention after receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis. A range of estimates of over diagnosis between 23% and 42% have been reported based on U.S. incidence. Depending upon the age at diagnosis, and the disease characteristics, the likelihood that a screen detected cancer has been over diagnosed can vary from below 5% to more than 75%. An unintended consequence of new technology is its use among those least likely to benefit. A disturbing trend has been noted in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer treated with robotic surgery and newer forms of radiotherapy (IMRT). A 2013 study reported that the use of advanced treatment technologies had increased among men in the Medicare population least likely to benefit from treatment, despite increasing awareness of the extent of over treatment for low risk disease. Even among the elderly, treatment rates for low risk prostate cancer are high; 59%, 36.6%, and 15.8% of patients age 75 and 79 years, 80 and 84 years, and more than or equal to 85 years were initially treated with radiation therapy in one study using Medicare data. These data highlight an important disconnect between evidence and practice given the results from randomized trials comparing treatment to no treatment (see Comparative outcomes of surgery and observation for prostate cancer below). = Comparative outcomes of surgery and observation for prostate cancer = The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study 4 (SPCG-4) cited previously, compared radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting among men (mean age 65 years) with localized prostate cancer diagnosed in the era prior to PSA screening. After 15 years of follow-up, men that underwent surgical treatment had significantly lower rates of distant metastatic disease and death from prostate cancer. This benefit of surgery was seen only among men below age 65 years, but not in those age 65 years and above in whom surgery did not provide a benefit in terms of freedom from metastatic disease or prostate cancer death. These data highlight an important aspect of prostate cancer management; the unlikely probability that treatment will improve health outcomes for older men with low risk disease (stage T1c/T2a, and PSA below 10 ng/ml, and Gleason score 6). The PSA era Prostate Cancer Intervention versus Observation Trial (PIVOT), compared radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting among 731 men (mean age 67 years) with localized prostate cancer. At 12 years, a subset of men with a PSA above 10 ng/ml and those with intermediate to high risk disease had a reduction in prostate cancer death with surgery as compared to watchful waiting. The findings from the SPGS-4 and PIVOT should inform practice for the older man with low risk disease, especially those with associated comorbidities unlikely to benefit from curative intervention. For these men, no treatment may be the most rational initial management considering that harm (quality of life decrement) is likely to outweigh any benefit (prostate cancer mortality reduction). = Identification of candidates for observation = Prostate cancer is in most cases a slowly progressive disease. However, early localized disease is curable whereas metastatic disease is not. Thus, a continued debate among clinicians is whether to treat early to prevent disseminated disease, or observe and delay treatment until there is evidence of progression. The former risks harm from overtreatment of an indolent disease; whereas the latter risks missing an opportunity for cure among those destined to experience progression. An unmet need is to identify the relatively small proportion of men with a lethal phenotype in whom death can be prevented by curative intervention, while avoiding treatment of the large pool of indolent disease that can be detected with screening. Selection of patients for active surveillance depends upon patient and tumor metrics, as well as a patient's personal preferences. The age, comorbidities, and estimated life expectancy of the patient are important to consider given that prostate cancer can be a slowly progressive disease that may not have time to progress in those whose remaining years of life are limited. In this respect, tools for estimating life expectancy can be useful in decision making. In terms of tumor metrics, natural history studies clearly demonstrate that Gleason score is a powerful predictor of the risk of disease progression and dissemination. It is therefore essential that the diagnosis reflect an accurate grade. For this, MRI-guided targeted biopsies may be superior to conventional TRUS-guided systematic biopsies; a National Institutes of Health study comparing the two biopsy approaches demonstrated that targeted biopsy results led to upgraded TRUS biopsy Gleason scores in 32% of cases, which could rule active surveillance out for those patients. In addition, the supplemental risk factor information provided by both stage and PSA at diagnosis should be included in making an active surveillance decision (see table above). Finally, the preference of a patient for living with cancer or side effects of treatment should be considered in decision making. Patients with similar disease characteristics for whom both observation and curative intervention might be reasonable, may have differing personal preferences. For some, willingness to accept a decline in quality of life to be rid of a cancer that has minimal chance of causing harm over a decade or more may seem reasonable; while others would rather live with a cancer and maintain their quality of life. An understanding of a patient's personal preferences should play a large part in shared decision making. Active surveillance as a management option for localized prostate cancer is offered to appropriate candidates that could also be offered aggressive local therapies (surgery and radiotherapy) with the intent to intervene if the disease progresses. Active surveillance is not recommended for men with high-risk disease, or those with primary Gleason pattern 4 or 5, who have a substantial risk of harboring systemic disease at diagnosis, and of progression to metastatic disease in the absence of treatment. However, active surveillance should be considered for those with very low, low, and intermediate risk prostate cancer (see table above) depending on overall health state and life expectancy, as well as personal preferences. The National Comprehensive Cancer Center Guidelines recommend active surveillance as the preferred management option for men with very low risk disease and a life expectancy below 20 years, and those with low risk disease and a life expectancy below 10 years; and an option for those with low risk disease and a life expectancy of 10 years or more, or intermediate risk disease and a life expectancy less than 10 years. = Definition of progression and triggers for intervention on active surveillance = Most urologists will monitor a patient on surveillance with PSA and digital rectal examination at least biannually, and perform surveillance prostate biopsies at 1-2 year intervals. However, defining disease progression is problematic. Progression in active surveillance programs has been defined based on PSA kinetics or exceeding a given PSA threshold, increased extent of cancer or higher grade disease on prostate biopsy, change in digital rectal examination, and proceeding to curative intervention. Yet, PSA changes and exceeding a given threshold PSA value may not reflect progression of disease. A change in stage or digital rectal examination findings is unusual among patients with low risk disease. Switching from surveillance to curative intervention may be triggered by a patient's personal preference or anxiety and not necessarily by a change in the cancer. Cancer grade is the strongest feature associated with long term freedom from disease in untreated men, and therefore the finding of high grade cancer (Gleason score above 6) is the most universally agreed upon trigger for intervention for men on surveillance. However, it appears that most men who are found to have high grade disease on surveillance biopsies, had the high grade disease missed on the diagnostic biopsy and not progression from low to high grade cancer while on surveillance. This misclassification of disease at diagnosis may be reduced in the future with improvements in imaging and biopsy tissue assessment that go beyond the Gleason score.  The future of active surveillance  Improvements in prostate imaging, biomarker discovery, and genetic profiling of prostate cancers will very likely change the approach to management of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer. Currently, active surveillance is underutilized (in part) because of the dual concerns that a cancer has been misclassified on a prostate biopsy, and the inability to define biologically which cancers have an aggressive phenotype. Thus, there is both over treatment of indolent disease and under treatment of aggressive disease. In the future it is likely that men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer will have had an assessment of the prostate using MRI, targeted biopsies of lesions considered suspicious, and gene expression signatures that focus on profiling the cancer based on molecular pathways associated with aggressiveness. Together with serum and urine biomarkers, this new paradigm may enhance our current stratification systems that rely to a great extent on light microscopic grading. This multidimensional approach may improve the ability to select the most appropriate candidates for surveillance and our ability to longitudinally monitor specific lesions within the prostate for evidence of disease progression. A number of centers are actively enrolling men in Active Surveillance Programs and have published results on this management strategy for prostate cancer. These include the Active Surveillance Program at The James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, the University of Toronto, and UCSF, all of which started in the early 1990s; the multi- institutional,https://web.archive.org/web/20140109163119/http://www.canaryfoundation.org/research/prostate- cancer-clinical-studies/ Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study (PASS) University of Miami, Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS), Royal Marsden, Memorial Sloan Kettering.

Goodall rose from obscure origins to the rank of lieutenant during the Seven Years' War, and continued to rise through the ranks to command his own ships. He ended the war serving in the West Indies and North America, having seen action at the Battle of Havana, and then returned to Britain. He commanded several ships in the peace before the outbreak of the American War of Independence, when he commanded several ships of the line with the Channel Fleet. He was with Keppel at the Battle of Ushant in 1778, and with Fielding at the capture of a Dutch convoy in 1780. Goodall next took part in Darby's relief of Gibraltar and the Second Battle of Ushant in 1781, after which he sailed to the West Indies to join the fleet under Sir George Rodney. Several fleet actions followed, and Goodall distinguished himself with service at the Battle of the Saintes and the subsequent Battle of the Mona Passage, where he was instrumental in the capture of two French ships of the line. After further service in North America, he returned to Britain on the conclusion of the war. The Spanish armament in 1790 provided a chance for further employment, he commissioned a ship, but stepped down with the passing of the crisis, having been promoted to rear-admiral. A brief posting to the Newfoundland command came in 1792, but he returned in winter that year just prior to the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Flying his flag aboard the 98-gun he served with Lord Hood's fleet, first as governor of Toulon during the occupation of that city, and then as second in command of the Mediterranean Fleet, under Hood's successor, Admiral William Hotham. Goodall took part in Hotham's two actions in 1795, the Naval Battle of Genoa and the Naval Battle of Hy√®res Islands, but the nature of the battles prevented any chance of distinguishing himself. Disappointed at not being offered the command of the fleet on Hotham's recall, Goodall struck his flag and retired ashore. He was promoted on the basis of his seniority to admiral of the white, but saw no further active service before his death in 1801. Early service Details of Goodall's family and early life are unknown, though he is presumed to have entered the navy c. 1750. The earliest date he is known to be active is 1 September 1756, when he was made lieutenant. He was promoted to commander on 2 June 1760 and given the 8-gun sloop , capturing the French privateer Duc d'Ayen on 7 August 1760 while she was at anchor off Egersund, Norway. Duc d'Ayen was a dogger armed with seven 4-pounders and had a crew of 65 men. Her capture was alleged to have been in violation of Denmark's neutrality, and Goodall became involved in a lengthy correspondence on the subject. The British fleet approach Havana in 1762 Goodall was then sent out to the West Indies where on 3 January 1762 he was promoted to the rank of post captain and on 13 January was made commander of the 24-gun . He joined the fleet under Sir George Pocock and took part in the Battle of Havana. In June he was sent to silence a battery east of Cojimar as part of the operations to land troops. He moved to the North American Station after this, where he assisted in the protection of the trade on the coast of Georgia before returning to Britain in spring 1764. The draw down of the navy after the Treaty of Paris ended the Seven Years' War left Goodall ashore on half-pay. He returned to service in 1769, commissioning the 32-gun in February and sailing to the Mediterranean in May. Goodall was then despatched in the summer of 1770 to protect British interests in Smyrna. American War of Independence =Channel Fleet= Combat d'Ouessant juillet 1778, by Jean Antoine Th√©odore de Gudin. A depiction of Keppel's action off Ushant on 27 July 1778. The outbreak of the American War of Independence offered further opportunities for employment as the navy built and activated ships. Goodall took command of the 64-gun in February 1778, and joined the fleet under Augustus Keppel in time to fight at the Battle of Ushant on 27 July. Defiance was heavily engaged in the fighting, losing eight men killed and seventeen wounded from her crew. She then joined the squadron under Molyneux Shuldham in December that year. In 1779 Goodall was appointed to the 74-gun , which he would command for the next four years. Goodall spent the first three of these serving with the Channel Fleet, at first under Sir Charles Hardy, and then from December with Commodore Charles Fielding's squadron. He was with the squadron on 31 December 1780 when the British force intercepted a Dutch convoy, and Fielding demanded to be allowed to search the ships. Their commander, Lodewijk van Bylandt refused, and Fielding attacked. After a brief action the Dutch surrendered and the convoy was taken into Portsmouth. Goodall then served under successive commanders of the Channel Fleet, firstly Sir Francis Geary, and then Sir George Darby. On 4 January 1781, while sailing in company with the 64-gun under Lord Mulgrave, a squadron of three French frigates was spotted and chased. Two of them escaped, but the third was chased down and engaged in a heavy fight by Courageux, until being forced to surrender. She was the former , which had been captured by the French in 1778. She had sustained losses of 49 killed and 24 wounded, while Courageux had 10 men killed and seven wounded. Minerva was taken back into the Royal Navy under the name HMS Recovery. =Gibraltar and West Indies= Goodall was next at the relief of Gibraltar by Darby's fleet on 12 April 1781, followed by service in Rear-Admiral Robert Digby's squadron, before returning to Darby's fleet in summer and autumn 1781. He was present at the Second Battle of Ushant with Rear-Admiral Richard Kempenfelt's fleet on 12 December 1781, after which he sailed to the West Indies to join the fleet there under Admiral Sir George Rodney on 28 February 1782. Goodall was engaged at the first clash with the French fleet under the Comte de Grasse off Dominica on 9 April 1782, and again at their decisive defeat at the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April. In the former engagement Valiant was part of the van, and was heavily involved in the fighting, suffering casualties of 38 men killed and wounded. At the Saintes Valiant was in the rear division and had nine killed and 28 wounded. The Battle of the Saintes, 12 April 1782: surrender of the Ville de Paris by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1783 After the victory at the Saintes, and during a period of calm weather, Rodney detached a squadron under his second in command, Sir Samuel Hood, to pursue some of the crippled French ships. Valiant was one of the ships detached with Hood, and on 19 April the squadron caught two ships of the line and three frigates at the entrance to the Mona Passage. The French force, consisting of the 64-gun ships Caton and Jason, and the frigates Astree, Aimable and Ceres attempted to escape, Hood signalling for them to be engaged before they could run themselves ashore. In the ensuing Battle of the Mona Passage, Valiant found herself the headmost ship, and with most of the other British ships becalmed or chasing other ships, Goodall pressed on sail to catch the Caton, and managed to rake her bows, on which she immediately struck. Goodall did not stop to take possession, but instead pressed on after the fleeing Jason, opening fire on her and fighting a fierce engagement for 45 minutes until the French ship surrendered. Valiant had 12 men killed and wounded in the action. Goodall sailed in July that year to North America with Admiral Hugh Pigot, stopping at New York City between September and October, and taking part in the blockade of Cape Fran√ßois in November. He returned to Jamaica in early 1783, and then departed for Britain in April that year to pay Valiant after the Peace of Paris brought about the conclusion of the war. Spanish armament and interwar years Goodall next comes to attention in May 1790 when he commissioned the 80-gun during the period of crisis known as the Spanish armament. Gibraltar was intended for service in the Channel, but the crisis passed over without breaking into open war. Goodall was made rear-admiral of the blue on 21 September 1790, and in 1792 received a posting to command in Newfoundland, hoisting his flag aboard the 50-gun . He returned to Britain in the winter, but was soon back on active service with the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars the following year. French Revolutionary Wars Goodall was promoted to rear-admiral of the red on 3 February 1793, and in April hoisted his flag aboard the 98-gun with orders to take one of the divisions of the fleet and sail south to take up a post as commander-in-chief Mediterranean Fleet. He served under Lord Hood during the occupation of Toulon, during which time he acted as governor of the city until the arrival from Britain of Sir Gilbert Elliott. Goodall then took part in the operations against Corsica, receiving official praise for his efforts from Hood, and a promotion to vice- admiral of the blue on 12 April 1794. He was appointed second in command to Hood's successor in the Mediterranean, Admiral William Hotham, and took part in the Naval Battle of Genoa on 4 March 1795, and the Naval Battle of Hy√®res Islands on 13 July, having been further advanced to vice-admiral of the white on 4 July 1795. These battles were minor victories for the British, though Goodall was unable to distinguish himself, a frustration he shared with another officer, Captain Horatio Nelson of . Goodall supported Nelson, and advised Hotham to press his advantage and call for a general action, but Hotham demurred. Goodall was not offered the command of the fleet after Hotham's recall, and reportedly disappointed by this, he requested permission to strike his flag at the end of 1795. He had no further active service, though he continued to be promoted on the basis of his seniority, reaching the rank of admiral of the blue on 14 February 1799, and admiral of the white on 1 January 1801. Admiral Samuel Goodall died unmarried at Teignmouth on 21 April 1801, and was buried there. He left bequests totalling nearly ¬£20,000 to naval friends and companions, hinting at 'a man who valued friendship and loyalty'.

It is launched by the department on 25 March 2010. Background The Education Bureau announced on 25 March 2010 that secondary schools would be invited to optimise their class structure through a voluntary class-size reduction scheme. It invited schools operating five or more Secondary One (S1) classes to consider optimising their class structure by means of class reduction on a voluntary basis. The arrangement for class reduction starts from S1 and extends to other levels progressively year by year. =Original Scheme Measures= According to the Scheme, schools are allowed to keep their incumbent teachers on the approved teaching staff establishment in the school year preceding the commencement of S1 class reduction for five years, so that the schools concerned can better plan to adjust their staff strength through natural wastage and other means. During the five-year toleration period of surplus teachers, on top of the entitled Senior Secondary Curriculum Support Grant (SSCSG) that these schools will continue to receive, they are also provided with an additional cash provision (extra SSCSG) in the amount of $0.25 million per annum for appointing teachers, teaching assistants and / or procuring services to enhance the quality of education. The measures later on have been enhanced. The enhanced measures for the Voluntary Optimisation of Class Structure Scheme were proposed in November 2010. To facilitate sustainable development of secondary schools under the New Senior Secondary (NSS) academic structure, the Education Bureau (EDB) invited schools operating five or more Secondary One (S1) classes to consider optimising their class structure by means of class reduction on a voluntary basis in March this year. The arrangement for class reduction starts from S1 and extends to other levels progressively year by year. Enhanced Measures To encourage more schools operating five or more S1 classes to join the Scheme, we will increase the flexibility of the Scheme and introduce enhanced measures. The details are as follows: 1. Within the six years from the commencement of S1 class reduction, a school will be given a maximum quota of six teaching posts. During the six-year transitional period, the school may use the quota to absorb surplus teachers arising from the class reduction on a voluntary basis. If there are teachers leaving the school during that period, the school may use the quota flexibly to employ teachers to fill the vacancies, provided that the overall teaching staff establishment does not exceed the approved teaching staff establishment in the school year preceding the commencement of class reduction. 2. The teaching posts in the quota are within the approved establishment and can be used for calculating the number of senior teacher posts and the ratio of graduate teachers in the school. 3. After the six-year transitional period, the teaching post quota will be withdrawn gradually over three years at a rate of two posts per year. 4. The surplus teachers arising from the reduction of classes may basically be absorbed by the six teaching post quota and through natural wastage. If there are surplus teachers arising from class reduction not being absorbed by the aforementioned arrangement, they will be tolerated provided that staff-related resources are first offset (please refer to paragraphs 5 and 6 below for details). Generally, we expect that most schools can resolve their surplus teacher situation through natural wastage after deploying the quota of six teaching posts within nine years from the commencement of class reduction. However, if individual schools still have surplus teachers in the tenth year after the commencement of class reduction, the EDB will extend flexibly the toleration period of surplus teachers according to the actual needs of the school. 5. In line with the existing measures provided under the Scheme, schools will be disbursed with an extra SSCSG provision in the amount of $0.25 million per annum for a total of five years. The designated disbursement period will be the first five years from the commencement of S1 class reduction (please refer to paragraphs 7 and 8 below for details).

Early life Born in Adelaide, South Australia in 1942, he was given a Kodak Box Brownie at the age of 9 by his parents, Bill and Poppy McFarlane. Five years later, while at Brighton High School (today known as Brighton Secondary School) in Adelaide's southern suburbs, he experienced the power of photography first hand, when he used a recently purchased Durst medium format rangefinder camera to capture an image of a teacher striking a pupil at the school assembly. Though talented in English and History, McFarlane was an undistinguished student and left school at 16, finding work as a trainee electric welder. He was deeply influenced , however, by the travelling documentary photography exhibition The Family of Man, which reached Adelaide in 1959. Career Encouraged by his employers during a brief stint as a copy boy in an advertising agency, he began to work more seriously as a photojournalist, gaining a commission from Walkabout to photograph Professor John Bishop, co-founder of the Adelaide Festival of Arts. On the same assignment he also made images of author Patrick White, dancer and choreographer Sir Robert Helpmann, actor John Bell and painter Sidney Nolan. In 1963 McFarlane moved to Sydney, working for The Bulletin and Australian Vogue. With the artist Kate Burness, who became his first wife, he travelled to London in 1969, where he freelanced for The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Times Magazine, and NOVA magazine. He returned to Sydney in 1973 and eventually to Adelaide in 2007. McFarlane was later married to the theatre director Mary-Ann Vale and has two children, Morgan (1974-1994, born to Kate Burness) and Billy (born 1990, to Mary-Ann Vale). Though McFarlane specialises in social issues ‚Äì he is currently working on a book documenting mental illness ‚Äì and performance, he has also taken portraits of a number of notable figures in Australian and international life. These include fellow photographers W Eugene Smith, Don McCullin, Jeff Carter, Max Dupain, David Moore, Trent Parke and Stephen Dupont; political figures such as Bob Hawke, Gough Whitlam, Charlie Perkins and Pauline Hanson; renowned surgeon Sir Edward \\"Weary\\" Dunlop; jazz violinist St√©phane Grappelli; boxer Henry Cooper; and Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun. His theatrical work has seen him cover a number of plays featuring Steven Berkoff, and he photographed the early performances of Geoffrey Rush, Cate Blanchett and Robyn Archer. McFarlane has also worked as a stills photographer for film directors such as Bruce Beresford, John Duigan, Gillian Armstrong, Esben Storm, Phillip Noyce, and PJ Hogan. In 1985, in the lead up to the 1988 bicentenary of Australia's European settlement, McFarlane was among 21 photographers chosen to live and work in remote Aboriginal communities in a project that became known as After 200 Years: Photographic Essays of Aboriginal And Islander Australia Today. It remains the largest single photographic project in Australian history, and was published both as a touring exhibition and a book. McFarlane's work is held in the permanent collections of the National Portrait Gallery (Canberra), the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of South Australia and the National Library of Australia. His most prominent recent exhibition is Received Moments, a 48-year career retrospective, which began touring Australia in December 2009 and concludes in Adelaide in late 2011. McFarlane was a significant contributor to Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s‚Äì1970s at the Art Gallery of South Australia (May to August 2010) which also featured the work of key Australian photographers Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott. McFarlane has written extensively about photography for a number of Australian publications, and was photographic critic for the Sydney Morning Herald for more than 25 years. He currently writes and maintains a website called OzPhotoReview, a blog focusing primarily on fine art and documentary photography in Australia while also discussing technical developments. The Received Moment Though McFarlane has not written extensively on the subject himself, his idea of the \\"received moment\\" has attracted media and curatorial attention. Related in some ways to Henri Cartier-Bresson's \\"decisive moment,\\" McFarlane's formulation is seen as being \\"gentler, more contemplative\\".Blain, Jenny \\"McFarlane Captures Received Moments\\", ABC Arts Blog By suggesting the need for the photographer to remain open to the world around, it also has the advantage of containing the seed of a photographic method. Gael Newton, senior curator of photography at the National Gallery of Australia, has written about McFarlane's approach and quotes him as saying \\"I see making pictures as a receiving of the image. Where you stand, both physically and emotionally, decrees the kind of picture you, through your camera, will receive\\".Newton, Gael \\"Robert McFarlane, Received Moments: Photography 1961-2009\\", Manly Art Gallery & Museum (catalog essay) Awards In 2017 he won the Jim Bettison and Helen James Award, awarded by the Adelaide Film Festival in collaboration with the Bettison and James Foundation.

Innovations included a Polaroid party in 1978, with cameras, flash bulbs and enough film for 320 exposures supplied by the instant photography company, and champagne to loosen inhibitions as participants pinned their pictures on the wall.Beatrice Faust, 'Polaroid proves a Pandora's Box,' The Age, Thursday, 16 Feb 1978, p.2 The first exhibition, Two Views of Erotica: Henry Talbot/Carol Jerrems (14 December 1972 ‚Äì 21 January 1973), was opened by photographer and filmmaker, Paul Cox, who was soon to open The Photographers Gallery around the corner in Punt Rd South Yarra.Anne Latrielle, 'Pictorial gallery open today,' The Age, Wednesday 05 Mar 1975, p.18 This period brought a reawakeningGeoff Strong: \\"With hindsight, most of those involved dismiss the suggestion that this golden age was some kind of Australian photographic renaissance ‚Äì that would be an insult to the older generation who had done much of the work without the support or the fanfare. But something happened in that decade. A convenient starting-point would be when Brummels Gallery first opened with Carol Jerrems' and Henry Talbot's 'Erotica' exhibition in 1972. A convenient finishing-point would be Joyce Evans' decision to close her Church Street Photographic Centre a decade later. The years between saw what was probably the greatest out-pouring of photographic energy that had ever happened in Australia....\\" Strong, Geoff (1988) 'The Melbourne Movement: fashion and faction in the seventies'.

Reception  Cultural commentator Phillip Adams in discussing Australian Grafitti, dubbed Ellis 'Australia's oldest hippy.' Art critic Nancy Borlase remarked, in relation to his inclusion, with Warren Breninger and Godwin Bradbeer in a 1978 Australian Centre for Photography show of the Melbourne photographers, that \\"Ellis, whose assured professionalism, in his The Way of Flesh series, places him in that class of photographers who use the camera as an extension of themselves, effortlessly and with obvious enjoyment,\\" and quoting him as saying \\"I like photographing behind the scenes, like Brassa√Ø.\\"Nancy Borlase, 'Camera on the threshold,' The Sydney Morning Herald, Saturday 04 Feb 1978, p.16  Legacy  Ellis died after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage at the age of 62.

While Jarvis was a student in a German university, he was fired by enthusiasm for the Greek Revolution. Jarvis sailed for Greece with Frank Abney Hastings, a Royal Navy officer, arriving on the island of Hydra on April 3.

Under guidance of Greek engineer M. Kokkinis he also helped fortify both Missolonghi and the island of Aitoliko. In August 1824 under Alexandros Mavrokordatos's leadership, he took part in the expedition to the northern Turkish strongholds of Kravassaras (Amfilochia) and Makrynoros, in the province of Epirus. During the invasion of the Morea by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, he assumed the expenses for the 45 soldiers sent to Methoni. From 1827 until his death on August 11, 1828, Jarvis along with Samuel Gridley Howe and Jonathan Peckam Miller, as members of the philhellenic committee of America, continued to contribute by distributing much needed medication, clothing and food to Greek population who had suffered during this time. George Jarvis died on August 11, 1828 most probably from tetanus or typhus.

The Pineapple gall adelgid (Adelges abietis) is a type of conifer-feeding insect that forms pineapple-shaped plant galls on its host species, commonly Norway and Sitka spruce. The adelgids (genus Adelges) are pear-shaped, soft-bodied green insects with long antennae, closely related to the aphid. \\"Adelges\\" lays up to one hundred eggs at a time, one on each needle. Adelges abietis (Linnaeus, 1758) is one of the most common species; synonyms are A. gallarum-abietis, Chermes abietis and Sacciphantes abietis. The pineapple or pseudocone gallDarlington, Arnold (1975) The Pocket Encyclopaedia of Plant Galls in Colour. Pub. Blandford Press. Poole. . P. 114. is a type of insect-formed gall, or abnormal outgrowth of plant tissue, that develops as a chemically induced distortion of needles, observed mostly on Norway spruce and Sitka spruce. Terminology and distribution Prominent in appearance, the pineapple or pseudocone gall is often confused with the actual cone of the tree, due to their superficial resemblance. Pineapple galls are distinguishable by their small size, position on the base of budding twigs, and habit of the branch growing on and extending past the gall. The pineapple gall adelgid is endemic to Europe, belonging to the 'woolly adelgid' group; it is also widely distributed in the north-eastern United States. Spruce gall aphid, eastern spruce pineapple gall adelges and eastern spruce gall aphid are alternative names.Forestry compendium This insect belongs to the superfamily Aphidoidea, and family Adelgidae. It is the primary pest of Norway Spruce. Another similar species, the Cooley spruce gall adelgid, is indigenous to North America. This adelgid usually affects Colorado Blue, Sitka, Englemann, and Oriental spruces.Cornell Co-operative Extension - Spruce Gall Adelgids. The eastern spruce gall adelgid (Adelges abietis Linnaeus) is an introduced species that feeds only on spruce. At least in 1985, the species was found in Canada from Ontario eastward and in adjacent parts of the United States.  Physical appearance of the pineapple gall  Detail of sectioned galls showing the chambers. An old pineapple pseudocone gall on a Norway spruce branch. The gall is formed from the swelling of the bases of the needles punctured by the feeding activity and activated by the saliva of the insect. The unilarval chambers are set in a woody core. The stem and needles of the host can continue growing beyond the position of the gall.Stubbs, F. B. Edit. (1986) Provisional Keys to British Plant Galls. Pub. Brit Plant Gall Soc. . P. 38. Sitka and Norway spruce are the main hosts, but A. abietis galls can be found on Colorado blue, white, and red spruces. The yellowish green galls pass through pink and then reddish-brown colour phases. On average, they measure 1.5 to 3.0 cm in length. Similar galls are produced by other aphids: on Sitka spruce, by the Cooley spruce gall adelgid, Gilletteela cooleyi, some generations of which migrate to Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia); and on spruce by Cnaphalodes sp., which is heteroecious with larch. The Cooley spruce gall adelgids form a larger gall, long, which usually covers the entire tip of infested new growth.  Life-cycle  A developing pineapple gall on a Norway Spruce. Pseudocone on Sitka Spruce. Only females of the pineapple gall adelgid are known. In spring, the newly hatched nymphs formed from over-wintered eggs feed at the bases of the growing needles; the induced swellings eventually coalesce to form the pseudocone structure, each cell of which contains about twelve nymphs. The nymphs overwinter under wax threads at the base of buds.The eastern spruce gall adelgid They die shortly afterwards, leaving the eggs, which resemble white, cottony twigs, protected beneath their bodies.Forest Pests. In late summer (July‚ÄìSeptember) the fully developed nymphs emerge from the galls and crawl out onto the needles, where they molt and develop wings. These adult adelgids may fly to other susceptible conifers, such as larch (Larix), pine (Pinus) and silver fir (Abies alba) or may continue the cycle on the same tree, as some are poor flyers.Eastern Spruce Gall Adelgid - Ohio University. Several generations are raised on these secondary hosts, however no galls are formed. In July of the following year winged adelgid appear and fly to the spruces to breed there again, completing the life cycle.  Gall forming insects  Some herbivorous insects create their own microhabitats by forming a highly distinctive plant structure called a gall, made up of plant tissue, but controlled by the insect. Galls act as both the habitat, and food sources for the maker of the gall. The interior of a bedeguar gall is formed from the bud, and is composed of edible nutritious and structural tissues. Some galls act as \\"physiologic sinks\\", concentrating resources in the gall from the surrounding plant parts.Larson, K. C., and T. G. Whitham. 1991.

Infestations of pineapple galls  Galls interfere with the natural formation of twigs and cause curling, stunting and the eventual death of new growth. Heavy infestations give the trees a ragged, unsightly appearance. Thus galls prevent twig growth and, if they are abundant, may affect entire trees. Individual trees vary in susceptibility to attack; some appear immune, others suffer growth reduction, and some are eventually killed. By itself, gall growth rarely causes lasting damage, but tends to leave affected trees susceptible to other health problems, including infestation of disease causing organisms and other harmful insects. Trees growing on good sites are generally less susceptible to attack than those on poor sites.  Control  Removal and destruction of newly formed galls will reduce adelgid populations. Although old galls can be unsightly, their removal will not affect adelgid populations because the organisms have already emerged from these galls. On small trees, galled shoot tips can be pruned, but generally, this is a pest that can be tolerated.Royal Horticulture Society =Biological control= There are no known effective parasites or predators of Adelges abietis. Specimen trees in gardens may be afforded a degree of protection by hanging up fat balls to encourage tits which will also feed on the adelgid gall formers.The Gardeners Magazine. April 2008. =Pesticides= If control measures are required, spray with bifenthrin on a dry, mild day in late February to control the overwintering generation. Some insecticides can be applied early, preventing gall formation and insect colonization.

Excepting galls formed by the spruce gall midge, galls are caused by aphid- like insects of the superfamily Phylloxeroidea (family Adelgidae) commonly known as the spruce gall adelgids. They have complex life cycles, some species feeding exclusively on spruce, others feeding on spruce and an alternate conifer. However, galls characteristic of each species are formed only on spruce. Six generations are usually needed to complete the 2-year cycle, and in the case of species having an alternate host, winged adults about 2 mm long are formed only in the generations that move from one host to the other. The spruce gall adelgid (Adelges lariciatus Patch) occurs in alternate years on spruce and larch from Alberta to the Maritimes and in adjacent parts of the United States. The pale spruce gall adelgid (Adelges strobilobius Kaltenbach) has a similar range but prefers black spruce or red spruce to white spruce.

As it includes music from numerous cultures, it is often seen as being a part of ethnomusicology, and indeed a study group looking into music archaeology first emerged from ethnomusicological group the ICTM, not from within archaeology. Definitions \\"In its broadest sense, music archaeology is the study of the phenomenon of past musical behaviours and sounds\\", as music archaeologist Adje Both connects several definitions.Arnd Adje Both, Music Archaeology: Some Methodological and Theoretical Considerations, in: Yearbook for Traditional Music, Vol. 41 , 2009, published by the ICTM Music archaeologists use methods of both musicology and archaeology. A theoretical and methodological basic work is still missing and one of the desiderata of the international community of researchers.Ricardo Eichmann, Einf√ºhrung in die Musikarch√§ologie , 2011 There are different goals in music archaeology: One of the most important is the exploration of excavated artefacts that are relevant for the reconstruction of ancient music, such as sound-producing devices, representations of musical scenes and textual evidence. The archaeological analysis and documentation of such artefacts, their dating and description as well as the explanation of find contexts and cultural contexts can shed light on its use and function in everyday life of the past, and can help us to rebuild them - i.e., to construct playable replicas. To produce music in a broader sense may also mean the investigation of early musical notations and literary sources that are \\"excavated\\" in libraries or other hidden places. These results may illuminate how instruments were played or how music was sung. But ultimately what was played in ancient times must remain in the dark of the past, and much fantasy is needed by modern musicians to imagine how melodies and rhythms may have been composed. Strictly speaking, only the sound of the instruments can be revived - these are the possibilities and limits of Music Archaeology. In the last few years the field has expanded considerably, with the inclusion of neurophysiological, biological, and psychological research. These approaches explore the possible beginnings of sound production by seeking the earliest prerequisites in the evolution of mankind for music making and musical 'understanding'. At the other end of the continuum, newly published evidence for musical notations and theoretical writings, or new literary and iconographic sources relevant to ancient music, can add to our understanding of mostly vanished music cultures. The observation and integration of ethnographic analogies in recent or contemporary societies may also help us discover long lasting traditions in making music which are comparable to the silent past. History A first attempt to join the two distinct disciplines of Musicology and Archaeology took place at the conference of the International Musicological Society at Berkeley in 1977. One of the round tables was designated \\"Music and Archaeology\\", to which were invited specialists to discuss the musical remains of ancient cultures - Bathia Bayer (Israel), Charles Boil√®s (Mexico), Ellen Hickmann (Egypt), David Liang (China), Casja Lund (Scandinavia). The main stimulus for this was the sensational discovery of an ancient Mesopotamian musical system by Anne D. Kilmer, assyriologist in Berkeley. On the basis of this she was able to advance a decipherment and transcription into Western notation of a late Bronze Age hymn in the Hurrian language, excavated from Ugarit, which contained notation based on the Mesopotamian system. With the help of musicologist Richard L. Crocker (Berkeley) and instrument maker Robert Brown, a replica of a Sumerian lyre was made, and Kilmer's version of the Hurrian hymn was recorded, accompanied by a carefully prepared commentary, as Kilmer/Crocker/Brown, Sounds from Silence, Recent Discoveries in Ancient Eastern Music (LP with information booklet, Bit Enki Publications, Berkeley, 1976). At the round table in Berkeley, Kilmer explained their method of reconstruction and demonstrated the resulting sound. This was the starting point of the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology, officially founded within the International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) in Seoul/Korea in 1981, and recognized by the ICTM in New York in 1983 following its first meeting on current music-archaeological research in Cambridge/UK in 1982. The ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology went on to hold international conferences in Stockholm (1984), Hannover/Wolfenb√ºttel (1986), Saint Germain-en-Laye (1990), Li√®ge (1992), Istanbul (1993), Jerusalem (1994/1995, together with the ICTM- Study Group for Iconography), and Limassol, Cyprus (1996). These meetings resulted in comprehensive conference reports. The International Study Group on Music Archaeology (ISGMA) has been founded by Ellen Hickmann and Ricardo Eichmann in 1998. The Study Group emerged from the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology with the objective to obtain closer cooperation with archaeologists. Since then, the ISGMA has worked continuously with the German Archaeological Institute, Berlin (DAI, Deutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut, Berlin). A new series called \\"Studien zur Musikarch√§ologie\\" was created as a sub-series of \\"Orient-Arch√§ologie\\" to present the conference reports of the ISGMA, and to integrate music-archaeological monographs independent of the Study Group's meetings; it is published by the Orient Department of the DAI through the Verlag Marie Leidorf. Between 1998 and 2004, conferences of ISGMA were held every two years at Michaelstein Monastery, Music Academy of Sachsen- Anhalt (Kloster Michaelstein, Landesmusikakademie Sachsen-Anhalt), sponsored by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft). In close cooperation with the Department for Ethnomusicology at the Ethnological Museum Berlin (Ethnologisches Museum Berlin, SMB SPK, Abteilung Musikethnologie, Medien-Technik und Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv), the 5th and 6th Symposium of the ISGMA were held in 2006 respectively in 2008 at the Ethnological Museum Berlin. In friendly cooperation with the Tianjin Conservatory of Music, the 7th Symposium of the ISGMA was held in Tianjin, China, in 2010. The 8th Symposium of the ISGMA (2012) was also held in China, in Suzhou and Beijing, and the 9th Symposium is being planned for September 2014, again held at the Ethnological Museum Berlin. Meanwhile, the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology continued separately, and holds its own events, although a number of researchers are involved in both groups. After a couple of years of no activities, Julia L. J. Sanchez re-established the Study Group in 2003 on the initiative of Anthony Seeger, beginning with meetings in Los Angeles, California (2003), and Wilmington, North Carolina (2006). These were followed by a joint-conference in New York (2009), the 11th of the Study Group since its foundation in 1981 (also the 12th Conference of the Research Center for Music Iconography). The 12th conference was then held in Valladolid, Spain (2011), which was the largest meeting of the ICTM Study Group so far, followed by the 13th symposium of the Study Group held in Guatemala 2013. In 2015, the 14th symposium will be held in Poland. In 2013 it was decided to establish a new series, Publications of the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology, published through Ekho Verlag. On 27 May 2011 a public concert under the banner of Palaeophonics, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Beyond Text programme and the University of Edinburgh Campaign, took place at the George Square Theatre in Edinburgh. The event showcased the outcomes of collaborative research and creative practice by archaeologists, composers, filmmakers and performers from across Europe and the Americas. Whilst inspired and driven by research in music archaeology, Palaeophonics represents the emergence of a new, possibly significant, development within the field and within musicology which approaches the subject through the production and performance of new sound and music based multi-media creative works instead of through direct representation and reproduction. Said by some observers as 'experimental' and 'avant-garde', the event provoked mixed feedback from a wide public audience of around 250 people. A related publication is planned and further Palaeophonics events are thought to be taking place in the future, although none are currently programmed, whilst funding for developing the project is sourced. In 2013, the European Music Archaeology Project (EMAP) has been funded by the EU funding programme EACEA, for the period of 5 years. The project will develop a touring exhibition on ancient music in Europe and an elaborate concert and event program.http://www.archaiologia.gr/en/blog/2013/06/13/listening-to-the-past/ Related fields From within this history, the subject has proliferated, including work on: Prehistoric Music. This has focused on the earliest period of music archaeology. Ancient Music. The most work in the field has been carried out on this period, which lies between prehistory and Early Music, which is often the study of western classical music from the medieval period onwards. In particular there has been substantial research carried out on Music of ancient Greece and Music of Ancient Rome. The Ancient Music wiki page carries more information and links.

The books have placed highly on bestseller lists in Russia, including the political booklist in the Moskva bookshop and the nonfiction list of probooks.ru, which combines sales information from the eight largest retailers and networks. These books discuss aspects of political, economic and ideological life in Russia and the world, and try to predict the future. As of 2011, four books have been published by EKSMO: # Project Russia (2005) # Project Russia, The Choice of the Way (2007) # Project Russia, The Third Millennium (2009) # Project Russia, The Great Idea (2010) Project Russia touched on social questions, saying that Russia faced collapse and needed a unifying idea. State structural problems in Russia were also analyzed, exploring the possibility that the Russian Federation might cease to exist. The authors of Project Russia predicted the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 in their 2005 book, describing the approaching unrest and analyzing its causes and the fall of the world order.Project Russia. Book 1, Preface: \\"Nowadays people behave like short-lived butterflies on a sinking ship. Because of its mental horizon no butterfly can comprehend the fact that the ship is sinking\\". History The first volume was published anonymously in 2005. It was delivered by the DHS delivery service (a federal mail service of the Russian government) to most governmental departments of the Russian Federation (the Federal Security Service, the Presidential Administration of Russia, the Attorney General's office, the Duma and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and public figures, including film director Nikita Mikhalkov. As a result, the book was discussed in Russian political circles. In 2006, Project Russia was published by OLMA Press and Eksmo. The second, third and fourth volumes were published by Eksmo, and the first edition of the third volume had a press run of one million copies. When The Third Millennium was published, advertisements in Kiev had Ukraine as part of Russia. Three days later, the advertisements were ordered to be removed by the Security Service of Ukraine. Mikhalkov said about Project Russia: \\"This book is very serious, very serious. Moreover, this is its anonymity that reveals the seriousness and unwillingness to appear personally and desire to express opinion about what occurs, occurred and will occur. I think that this book was written by very serious, religious and educated people\\". Alexander Khinshtein, a State Duma representative and journalist, said: \\"I completely agree with the words given in the book about the dominance of the people of limited thinking in power. I don‚Äôt mind against monarchy, by the way we are living in the conditions not far from it\\". Project Russia books were seen in the office of First Deputy Chief of the Russian Presidential Administration Vladislav Surkov. Authors Since the Project Russia author was anonymous and the first three volumes were not copyrighted, speculation began about the books' author. According to LDPR founder and leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Kremlin produced Project Russia to create a unitary state. Although Internet reports indicated that the author is Russian ambassador to NATO Dmitry Rogozin, in an interview for the newspaper New Region Rogozin himself neither confirmed nor denied the possibility. According to Alexander Goldfarb, a Russian activist close to oligarch Boris Berezovsky, all that is known for certain is that the project was ordered by the Kremlin. Goldfarb wrote that the CIA had two versions: Putin and his group conceived the project, or Project Russia was produced by high-level officials other than Putin. Possible Freemasonry authorship was mentioned, with similarities noted between Project Russia and the rules of masonic organizations. Sources in the Moscow Patriarchy called it a new sect: \\"Some structure, maybe even having thought out the technology of realization of its plan, spread nets for appealing people to another post-, or super-, or overreligious sect\\". Nothing was known about Project Russia sponsorship, although Russian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin was rumored to be involved. Yakunin is considered a member of Putin's inner circle. When the fourth volume was published in fall 2010, Project Russia author appeared. Several months earlier, a scanned contract on LiveJournal confirmed that the author was Yuriy Shalyganov. Project Russia, The Great Idea was copyrighted by Shalyganov, who gave several interviews. Shalyganov is not well known. According to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, he was born in Moscow in 1967 and may have worked for the KGB.

Gallagher won Britain's first ever Winter Paralympic gold medal during Sochi 2014. Childhood Gallagher was born on 18 May 1985 and was raised in Bangor in the north of County Down. Her father, Patrick Gallagher, was an airline pilot. She is a graduate in mathematics from the University of Bath. Pre- Paralympics Gallagher has oculocutaneous albinism, is visually impaired and competes with a sighted guide. At the 2009 New Zealand Winter Games Gallagher, competing with guide Claire Robb, won gold in her first ever international race, the giant slalom. She was selected for the British team at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in February 2010. Gallagher is funded by the Sport Northern Ireland Athlete Support Programme and supported by the Sports Institute for Northern Ireland and is also backed by Disability Sports NI. 2010 Paralympics Gallagher was one of seven skiers for Great Britain at the 2010 Winter Paralympics and became the first athlete from Northern Ireland to compete in the Winter Paralympics. At the Games she contested the giant slalom and slalom events for visually impaired athletes. She finished sixth in the slalom but achieved the British team's highest finish, missing out on a medal by a single place and 3.36 seconds in the giant slalom. Between Paralympics left Following the Paralympics Gallagher sought a new sighted guide to work with her through to the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi and selected 19-year-old Charlotte Evans from Medway. Evans had been out of the sport after she snapped a cruciate ligament in 2009 but took up the role having become a qualified coach. In January 2011 Gallagher became the first British athlete to win a medal at the IPC World Championships. Competing with Evans the pair won the silver medal in the slalom and bronze in the giant slalom at the event held in Sestriere only five weeks after they started working together. The pairing also won a gold medal in slalom at the 2011 Europa Cup Finals. 2014 Paralympics Gallagher won Britain's first ever Winter Paralympic gold on 10 March 2014, during the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia. She finished first in the visually impaired Super-G competition. She fell during both the super-combined and the giant slalom. She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to sport for people with a visual impairment. The Ski Club of Great Britain awarded her with a Pery Medal along with the other medal winners from the 2014 Olympics and Paralympics. 2017 World Championships and 2018 Paralympics In 2017 Gallagher was selected for the 2017 World Para Alpine Skiing Championships in Tarvisio in Italy. Partnered with Gary Smith, she crashed during training on the championship sloped and injured herself after colliding into the safety netting. She sustained a dislocated elbow and three fractured ribs in the accident and was airlifted to a local hospital. Gallagher's injuries ruled her out of the championship and her subsequent rehabilitation meant that she only returned to the slopes in the season leading up to the 2018 Winter Paralympics. Despite losing time to her injuries Gallagher was still able to secure her place in the Great Britain team for the 2018 Paralympics. 2019 World Championships At the 2019 World Para Alpine Skiing Championships, Gallagher and Smith narrowly missed out on medals in the slalom and the giant slalom by finishing fourth, being pipped to the bronze by a tenth of a second in the latter by team-mates Menna Fitzpatrick and Jennifer Kehoe. However they claimed their first medal of the championships in the downhill, where they took a silver behind Fitzpatrick and Kehoe. They then went on to take two bronzes in the super-G and combined, increasing Gallagher's number of Worlds medals won to nine.

This consists of three fragments now deposited in the Museums of Lyons and Nuremberg, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Discovered by Canon Bock in the old church of Saint Gereon at Cologne, these pieces are of extraordinary interest, and have received intense scrutiny from experts in the textile arts. The pattern is a piece of simple repetition. The chief feature is a circular band enclosing animals‚Äîa bull, a griffin, and a bird. The background has a foundation pattern of triangles upon which is placed ornament of Byzantine style. A border encloses the whole, and consists of floriated bands issuing from grotesque masks. The animals show a certain Oriental influence, rather strongly marked; but otherwise the style, especially in the border, is distinctively Western.\\"Tapestry: The Origins The Cloth of St Gereon is regarded as the oldest or second oldest known European tapestry still existing, dating to the early 11th century,Anzovin, p. 175 \\"The first European tapestry still extant is the Cloth of St. Gereon, originally created for the Church of St. Gereon in Cologne, Germany.

Description  The seven-color tapestry shows medallions with bulls and griffins in combat. It was probably adapted from Byzantine or Syrian silk textiles. The motifs of the tapestry could also have derived from Sassanian textiles found in Cologne. The addition of oriental themes in the framing reveals a first attempt at variety.Hamlyn, p. 11 The border design and background are probably the inspiration of Europe, not oriental. They are similar to 11th-century illuminated manuscripts of Cologne and Western Europe. There are no other examples of tapestry similar to this that survive other than the oldest tapestry panel in the cathedral of Halberstadt depicting \\"Abraham and the Archangel Michael\\", which was probably woven around 1175 A.D.

The background may have been colored (probably brownish-blue), but this is now undeterminable as it is almost completely faded out.Guiffrey, p. 14 Tapestry historian Hunter says the design is of Byzantine origin, however the weave indicates an oriental maker.Hunter, p. 34  History  Scholars place the area it was made in Cologne in the early part of the 11th century.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - Cloth of Saint Gereon The name for the tapestry is taken from the place of origin, the St. Gereon's Basilica in Cologne. It was hung in the church choir area. The tapestry was cut into four fragments by the leading German art historian Dr. Franz Bock.H.M.S.O., p. 22 These were then acquired in or around 1875 by four European museums. The fragments of the Cloth of Saint Gereon are located at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Lyon (one almost complete roundel with linking lion mask roundel), the Kunstgewerbe-Museum in Berlin, Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg (two roundels of the main field, a top segment cut) and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (bottom and right border).Viale, p. 15Hamlyn, p. 15 A large part of the original is now in the museum at Lyon, while smaller parts are at Berlin and Nuremberg.

Guido G. Lanfranco The genus consists of only one species, Cynomorium coccineum (although one of its subspecies is sometimes treated as a separate species). Its placement in the Saxifragales was resolved in 2016 with the help of nuclear, plastid, and mitochondrial sequences obtained from next-generation sequencing. Common names include the misleading Maltese fungus or Maltese mushroom; also desert thumb, red thumb, tarthuth (Bedouin) and suoyang (Chinese). A rare or local species, it grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in salt marshes or other saline habitats close to the coast. It has had a wide variety of uses in European, Arabian and Chinese herbal medicine.ITM Online: CYNOMORIUM: Parasitic Plant Widely Used in Traditional Medicine, by Subhuti Dharmananda, Ph.D., plus The Treasure of Tarthuth, by R.W. Lebling, Jr. (accessed 19 April 2011, 22:24 GMT)The historical guide to the island of Malta and its dependencies. p. 88-89. Description This plant has no chlorophyll and is unable to photosynthesise. It is a geophyte, spending most of its life underground, in the form of a rhizome, which is attached to the roots of its host plant; it is a holoparasite, i.e. totally dependent on its host. The low-growing inflorescence emerges (in spring, following winter rain), on a fleshy, unbranched stem (most of which is underground) with scale-like, membranous leaves. Dark-red or purplish, the inflorescence consists of a dense, erect, club-shaped mass, some long, of minute scarlet flowers, which may be male, female or hermaphrodite.UBC Botanical Garden: Botany Photo of the Day , 26 Feb 2008 (accessed 19 April 2011, 22:24 GMT) It is pollinated by flies, attracted to the plant by its sweet, slightly cabbage-like odour. Once pollinated, the spike turns black. The fruit is a small, indehiscent nut.DELTA (accessed 20 April 2011, 20:44 GMT) In the Mediterranean region, Cynomorium is a parasite of salt-tolerant plants in the Cistaceae (cistus family) or Amaranthaceae (amaranth family); elsewhere it parasitizes Amaranthaceae, Tamaricaceae (tamarisks) and, in China, Nitrariaceae,MOBOT Saxifragales (accessed 20 April 2011, 20:44 GMT) especially Nitraria sibirica. Other authorities suggest the host plants are saltbushes (Atriplex species, Amaranthaceae). DNA studies suggest that Cynomorium is not a member of the Balanophoraceae, as previously thought, but more probably belongs to the Saxifragales, possibly near Crassulaceae (stonecrop family). The issue is complicated by the massive horizontal gene transfer between Cynomorium and its different hosts. Cusimano, N., and S. S. Renner. 2019. Sequential horizontal gene transfers from different hosts in a widespread Eurasian parasitic plant, Cynomorium coccineum. American Journal of Botany 106(5): 679-689. File:Cynomorium coccineum (habitat).jpgHabitat in Sardinia File:Cynomorium coccineum (flowers).jpgClose-up detail of flowers File:Plante desert Wadi Rum.jpgEmerging inflorescence in the desert in Jordan  Taxonomy  Long disputed, Cynomorium was placed in the Saxifragales in 2016, but its placement within that order remains uncertain.  Distribution  Cynomorium coccineum var. coccineum is found in Mediterranean regions, from Lanzarote in the Canary Islands and Mauritania through Tunisia and Bahrain in the south; Spain, Portugal, southern Italy, Sardinia, Sicily, Gozo, Malta and the Eastern Mediterranean.World Checklist of Selected Plant Families (2010). Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (accessed 19 April 2011, 22:44 GMT) Its range extends as far east as Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran. It is also present at the Al Wathba Wetland Reserve in Abu Dhabi. Cynomorium coccineum var. songaricumWorld Checklist of Selected Plant Families (2010). Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (accessed 19 April 2011, 22:44 GMT) is found in Central Asia and Mongolia, where it grows at high altitudes. Several authorities consider this to be a separate species, C. songaricum; it is called \\"suoyang\\" () in China, where it is extensively collected as a herbal remedy for illnesses including sexual worries and nocturnal emissions.Flora of China 13:434 (2007) (accessed 20 April 2011, 20:44 GMT) History and historical uses Sir David Attenborough has suggested that, following the reasoning of the \\"Doctrine of signatures\\", the phallic shape of the inflorescence suggested to early herbalists that Cynomorium should be used as a cure for erectile dysfunction and other sexual problems. Its colour suggested that it would cure anaemia and other diseases of the blood. It has been used for similar purposes in the east and west of its range: crusaders carried dried spikes to help them recover from their wounds. Other traditional uses have included treatments for apoplexy, dysentery, sexually transmitted diseases, hypertension, vomiting and irregular menstruation. The city of Kuyu was also known as Suoyang City (the Chinese name for cynomorium), after the 7th-century general Xue Rengui and his army supposedly survived a siege there by eating the plant. Much later, it was \\"introduced\\" (or possibly imported) to China from Mongolia during the Yuan dynasty as a medicinal plant, and is first mentioned by Zh≈´ DƒÅnxƒ´ () in his Supplement and Expansion of Materia Medica () in 1347. It was an ingredient in his recipe for hidden tiger pills (), used for impotence and weak legs. During the 16th century, the Knights of Malta greatly prized the plant and sent samples of it to European royalty. They incorrectly believed it to be a fungus, and it became known as \\"fungus melitensis\\", \\"Maltese mushroom\\". The Knights jealously guarded \\"Fungus Rock\\", a large rock formation, on whose flat top it grew in abundance, just off the coast of Gozo. They even tried smoothing the outcrop's sides to prevent theft of the plants, which was said to be punishable by death. The only access was by a precarious cable car, which was maintained into the early 19th century. The rock is now a nature reserve, so access is still strictly limited. In the Middle Ages, Arabic physicians called it \\"tarthuth\\" and \\"the treasure of drugs\\". An aqrabadhin, or medical formulary, compiled by Al-Kindi in the 9thcentury lists tarthuth as an ingredient in a salve to relieve skin irritation; later, Rhazes (Al-Razi) recommended it to cure piles, nosebleeds, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. In Saudi Arabia, where Cynomorium is also called \\"tarthuth\\", in addition to the uses detailed above an infusion made from the ground, dried mature spike has been used to treat colic and stomach ulcers. It was eaten on long journeys by the Bedouin people, who would clean and peel the fresh spikes and eat the crisp white interior, which is said to be succulent and sweet, with a flavour of apples and a pleasantly astringent effect. It is also relished by camels. It has often been used as a \\"famine food\\" (last reported during the 19thcentury in the Canary Islands). Among many other uses it has been used as a contraceptive, a toothpaste, and a non-fading crimson fabric dye.

It was from the second marriage that Joseph George Morley was born. George Morley registered his harp making, tuning, and repair business at 95 High St, White Chapel, London, in 1817. His brother, Charles Morley (1796‚Äì1858), entered into partnership with him in 1820.Rensch, Roslyn: Harps and Harpists, Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis, 2007, p. 179, A single-action pedal harp dated around 1810 in the Henry Ford Museum is believed to be the work of George Morley. In the 1860s, Charles' son Robert (1840‚Äì1916) and George's son Joseph George (1847‚Äì1921) were both apprenticed to the Paris harp maker, √ârard. Joseph George Morley Joseph George Morley (1847‚Äì1922) inherited his father's harp business and went on to become Britain's most prominent harp maker. Following the demise of √ârard's London operation in 1890, Joseph George took over √ârard's London stock and goodwill and established a shop and workshops at 6 Sussex Place, South Kensington, London. In 1893 he acquired the business of Philip Holcombe, the maker of both Dodd and Dizi harps. Joseph George Morley designed and built a 48-string pedal harp called The Morley Orchestral Twentieth Century Harp. It was marketed as The Largest Pedal Harp in the World. He was also the author of three books on the harp: Strings, Stringing and Tuning (unknown date), Harp History (1913), and Harp Playing (1918).Marson, John: The Book of the Harp: The techniques, history and lore of a unique musical instrument, Kevin Mayhew, Stowmarket, 2005, p. 222, John Sebastian Morley regulates a Ram's Head pedal harp. John Sebastian Morley After inheriting the family business from his father, John Sebastian Morley (1897‚Äì1988) ran Morleys with his wife, Elizabeth (Betty) Morley, a celebrated harpist and teacher. Morleys became a home away from home for world-famous harpists, who frequently dropped in to do business and exchange news. After the First World War, the demand for new pedal harps had dropped to the point where John Sebastian began to concentrate exclusively on harp repair and the making of small, Irish-style harps. John Sebastian Morley was the founding president of the United Kingdom Harp Association. John Morley, Clive Morley, and Benjamin Morley In 1968, John Sebastian Morley retired and his business became part of Robert Morley and Co Ltd, headed by Robert Morley's descendants, John (b. 1932) and Clive (1936‚Äì2015). Demerging in 1987, Clive Morley took his newly established harp business to Filkins, Gloucestershire, trading as Clive Morley Harps. Since 2006, the company has been run by Clive's son, Ben Morley (b. 1970).

He was an ancestor of the noble Swedish family, Horn af Kanckas. Biography He was the son of Klas Henriksson Horn (c. 1445 ‚Äì c. 1520) and his second wife Kristina Jakobsdotter (c. 1495 ‚Äì c. 1553). His father was a member of the Privy Council of Sweden. His elder half-brother, Krister Laavunpoika of Joensuu (c. 1480 ‚Äì c. 1519) was bailiff of Turku castle. His parents presumably married in 1511 when his father was commander of the Vyborg Castle (Finnish: Viipurin linna). Lady Kristina of Salmenkyl√§ was heiress of T√∂yt√§rinhovi Manor and its estate, as well as of an estate in Reitkalli, an estate in Salmenkyl√§, an estate in Sivatti, an estate in Py√∂li, and a house and harbor estate in Hietakyl√§ (today Hamina), near the medieval church of Vehkalahti, and additionally heiress of a portion of the Vanhakartano Manor of Lammi in the province of H√§me.Sj√∂str√∂m (2011), \\"Medieval landed inheritances of the Junkar and Vilken lineages of Vehkalahti, Finland\\", Journal of the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy, vol 3 issue 5 (January 2011), pp 425‚Äì461 He was not quite ten years old when his father died, probably in summer 1520. Mother and son resided chiefly at Haapaniemi Manor in Kisko, on the borders of Nylandia and Finland, where Kirsti is recorded as widow by 1524 and in 1530. Around 1531, Kristi married Jaakko Vundrank (floruit 1529 ‚Äì c. 1548), an administrator in service of King Gustav Vasa of Sweden and a fiefholder of Elim√§ki in Kymenlaakso. That marriage produced sometime in the 1530s, Tyni Jaakonpoika Vundrank, lord of Salmenkyl√§ (fl. 1560s & 1570s, died before 1584). In the 1530s he was serving King Gustav, both at the royal court and in the military. He was briefly over-governor of Stockholm castle. Then he was inspector of royal revenues in Finland and commander of Finnish infantry. Henrik worked under Gustav and his two oldest sons King Erik XIV of Sweden and King John III of Sweden (who ruled Finland under the title of Duke John). He became chief judge in southern Finland through 1549 - 1561. He was also appointed Governor-General of Finland in 1551. In 1555 he participated in the campaign against Shlisselburg (Swedish: N√∂teborg). King Eric XIV of Sweden knighted him at his royal coronation (1561) and he was sent as commander-in- chief to the Livonian front. Between 1558 and 1563 he was one of Duke John's closest advisors. He then served under King Erik XIV, and was made a colonel during the Livonian War in October 1563 and Governor of Estonia and highest commander of the Swedish Infantry in the Baltic Dominions of Sweden. He defeated a German mercenary force near Tallinn in 1565. He was named to the position of High Councillor in 1566. In 1565 he became governor of Reval and over Livonia. He lost command in 1567 after the failure of the Swedish siege of Narva in 1579 and was replaced by Pontus de la Gardie (c. 1520 ‚Äì 1585). King John III appointed him as Governor-General of Finland and he served as such from 1572 until around 1580. This command included being commander-in- chief of all troops in Finland. He was one of leaders of attempted conquest of Northwestern Russia, in 1578-1580, but successes were only sporadic in midst of all sorts of failures. In the 1580s, he was active in defence tasks: castellan of K√§kisalmi fortress and governor of Eastern Finland. In the 1580s, he settled to Taipale Manor which he had built in Masku, and left Kankainen Manor to his eldest son, Field Marshal Karl Henriksson Horn af Kanckas (1550‚Äì1601). By 1584, his maternal half-brother Tyni Jaakonpoika Vundrank, lord of Salmenkyl√§ (died before 1584) had died, apparently without any progeny, and his holdings in Vehkalahti (estates in Salmenkyl√§, Reitkalli, Hietakyl√§ and Husu-Py√∂li) passed to him. Later, in the early 17th century, a part of the Vehkalahti properties belonged to his grandson Klas Horn and another part (T√∂yt√§rinhovi of Vehkalahti) belonged to his other grandson, Admiral Henrik Fleming (1584‚Äì1650). Personal life In the mid-1540s (presumably around 1544), he married Elin Arvidsdotter of the Ter√§sk√§si- crested family (died 1577 at Kankainen Manor). She was a daughter of Arvid Eriksson (died 1529), lord of Syd√§nmaa Manor, justiciar of Karelia, castellan of H√§meenlinna and his wife Kirsti Nuutintyt√§r of Laukko (fl. 1515; died 1551 at Grabbacka manor, Karjaa), and stepdaughter of Niiles Grabbe, castellan of Viipuri (died 1549 at Grabbacka manor, Karjaa). From his marriage, he had at least ten children, including three sons Karl, Arvid and Yrj√§n√§, and daughters Kirsti, Kaarina, Piriitta, Elina, Elisabeth and Anna. He and his wife became the ancestors of the noble Swedish family, Horn af Kanckas. He died on 21 June 1595 at the age of 83 at Kankainen Manor in Masku in southwestern Finland.

History  = Origins = Since the establishment of the Government of South Korea on August 1948, the Ministry of Social Issues (ÏÇ¨ÌöåÎ∂Ä ;Á§æÊúÉÈÉ®) handled discrimination against women until the department's merge in 1955. Afterwards, the Ministry of Social Issues merged with the Ministry of Health (Î≥¥Í±¥Î∂Ä) to become the Ministry of Social Issues and Health (Î≥¥Í±¥ÏÇ¨ÌöåÎ∂Ä). In 1994, the Ministry of Social Issues and Health became the Ministry of Health and Welfare (Î≥¥Í±¥Î≥µÏßÄÎ∂Ä); consequently, it began to take address discrimination against women. However, the ministries were criticized for the lack of advancement for women's social position and the lack of enforcement of its policies. Specific policies addressing sexism began to be addressed with the establishment of the Department heading state affairs (Ï†ïÎ¨¥Ïû•Í¥ÄÏã§) on February 25, 1998. On February 28, 1998, the Presidential Commission on Women's Affairs (Ïó¨ÏÑ±ÌäπÎ≥ÑÏúÑÏõêÌöå) was formed under President Kim Dae-jung.

The Vice Minister controls the following divisions: the Management Supporting Division; Planning & Coordination Office; Women's Policy Bureau; Youth & Family Policy Office; Women & Youth Rights Promotion Bureau. The Spokesperson is in charge of the Public Relations Division. Controversy  MOGEF has been historically criticized for the involvement of the word Women (Ïó¨ÏÑ±) in its name, which had led to charges of taking a side in the issue of gender inequality and reverse discrimination.In Korean, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family is translated as Ïó¨ÏÑ±Í∞ÄÏ°±Î∂Ä or Ïó¨ÏÑ±Î∂Ä, and the controversy here is that the word 'Ïó¨ÏÑ±,' which could be used to mean women, are included The ministry has been involved in several controversies, which has led to a movement calling for its abolishment in 2006, 2008, and 2013. On 2006, the MOGEF established a policy to pay men not to hire prostitutes on men's New Year's Day parties. Men were told to sign up on the website with their national identification number, and the total budget was 3,600,000 Won (3,175 US Dollars). This led to a signing movement to abolish the ministry. On November 2011, the ministry enforced a System of forced shutdown of teenage gaming (Ï≤≠ÏÜåÎÖÑ Í≤åÏûÑ Í∞ïÏ†ú ÏÖßÎã§Ïö¥Ï†úÎèÑ), which has been involved in heavy controversy.

He did not play first-class cricket the following season, playing two Minor Counties Championship fixtures for Devon instead, but he played first-class cricket for Middlesex again from 1948 to 1954. Routledge played a total of 65 first-class matches, including one for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1951 against Essex. As a batsman at first-class level he was initially a tailender, before developing into a middle-order batsman. In 64 first-class matches for Middlesex, he scored 1,305 runs at a batting average of 16.51, with five half centuries and two centuries. His highest score of 121 came against Worcestershire in 1953. An occasional bowler, Routledge took 38 wickets with his medium pace at a bowling average of 41.57, with best figures of 4/29.

Life Francis Henry Vincent is said to have been born in Dorset in around 1796. He is always referred to as Henry Vincent. Vincent was wounded and lost an eye in the Battle of Waterloo. He was the gaoler at Fremantle from 1831 until he was given the job of constructing the \\"Rottnest Native Establishment\\". He was appointed Superintendent of the Rottnest Island Aboriginal Prison in 1839, and held the position for 27 years, until 1867.Henderson James A. & T. Perigo, \\"Rottnest, (1989) Links In History\\" (Rottnest Island Authority, Perth, 1989), pp. 10-15. Under Vincent's rule many Aborigines died. However this was not unique to his supervision; between 1838, when the prison was opened, and 1931, it is reported that there were 369 Aboriginal fatalities.Pederson, Howard, Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Perth, File No. 88/699 'Deaths of Aborigines in Custody': List of 'Aboriginal Men Who Died At Rottnest Island, 1838-1900' While most deaths were caused by disease, it is reported that five prisoners were hanged.Somerville, W. (1966) \\"Rottnest Island, In History and Legend\\" (Rottnest Island Board, Perth, 1966), p. 74. Vincent was extremely cruel, and eventually his overtly brutal treatment of the prisoners concerned even the colonial authorities, to the extent that the Governor sent an investigator to the island. The investigator was later driven off the island by Vincent. For his treatment of Aboriginal prisoners, Vincent was forced into retirement in 1867, and his place was taken by William Jackson.Henderson James A. & T. Perigo, Rottnest, Links In History (Rottnest Island Authority, Perth, 1989), pp. 10-15. Like many in the Western Australian Swan River colony, Vincent believed that the Aborigines were an inferior race, doomed to extinction. As superintendent of the prison, Henry Vincent left his mark on the island. With Aboriginal labour he designed and built many of the old colonial buildings that can still be seen today. Vincent managed, with the aid of his Aboriginal prisoners, to build and successfully run a farm on the island.Green, Neville (1981) \\"Aborigines and Settlers\\" in C.T. Stannage, ed. A New History Of Western Australia (University of Western Australia Press Nedlands, 1981), p. 89-92. Most of the development took place in Thomson Bay; of particular significance is the Quod that was the prison accommodation for the Aboriginal men. Vincent died on 6 May 1869 when he was said to be 73 years old. The service took place at St John's Church and he was buried in Fremantle Cemetery. . Vincent's other injury: what is not stated in the above notes is that Vincent suffered another injury in the battle of Waterloo. He was shot in the groin. The lead shot was never removed and only in the latter part of his term at Rottnest did lead poisoning cause what is acknowledged as irrational and perhaps aggressive behavior, a common symptom of lead poisoning. In the early part of his tenure, he brought some very interesting construction techniques to roofing probably learnt from his experience in France. For example, one of these was to saw timber beams thereby converting them into a trussed roof frame. He retained a property in Fremantle the frontage of which still exists in 2020 although it is concealed by a much later addition extending from the street boundary.

His 1910 book The Copping Bible illustrated by himself became a best-seller. Biography Born in Camden Town in 1863, he was the second son of journalist Edward Copping (1829‚Äì1904) and Rose Heathilla (n√©e Prout) (1832‚Äì1877), the daughter of John Skinner Prout, the water-colour artist. His brother, Arthur E. Copping, became a noted author, journalist and traveller and was a member of The Salvation Army. Harold Copping entered London's Royal Academy where he won a Landseer Scholarship to study in Paris. He quickly became established as a successful painter and illustrator, living in Croydon and Hornsey during the early years of his career.Copping on the Look and Learn website Copping had links with the missionary societies of his time including the London Missionary Society (LMS), who commissioned him as an illustrator of Biblical scenes. To achieve authenticity and realism for his illustrations he travelled to Palestine and Egypt. The resulting book, The Copping Bible (1910), became a best-seller and led to more Bible commissions. These included A Journalist in the Holy Land (1911), The Golden Land (1911), The Bible Story Book (1923) and My Bible Book (1931). Copping used family, friends and neighbours as models in his paintings, keeping a stock of costumes and props at his home. In many of his Bible paintings one of his wife's striped tea towels can be seen worn on the heads of various Bible characters. Copping's beautifully executed watercolour illustrations were put onto lantern slides and were used by Christian missionaries all over the world. His pictures were also widely reproduced by missionary societies as posters, tracts and as magazine illustrations.Copping's Bible Pictures ‚Äì The Bible Illustration blog Copping and Violet Amy Prout at the time of their engagement (c.1887) Probably the most famous of Copping's Bible illustrations was 'The Hope of the World' (1915). This depicts Jesus sitting with a group of children from different continents. Dr. Sandy Brewer wrote of this image: \\"The Hope of the World, painted by Harold Copping for the London Missionary Society in 1915, is arguably the most popular picture of Jesus produced in Britain in the twentieth century. It was an iconic image in the Sunday school movement between 1915 and 1960\\".Brewer, Sandy 'From Darkest England to The Hope of the World: Protestant Pedagogy and the Visual Culture of the London Missionary Society' ‚Äì Material Religion: The Journal of Objects, Art and Belief Volume 1, Number 1, January 2005 , pp. 98‚Äì124 However, James Thorpe, in his book English Illustration: the Nineties wrote: \\"Harold Copping‚Äôs work, capable and honest as it was, does not inspire any great enthusiasm; there are so many artists doing illustrations equally satisfactory in literal translation and equally lacking in strong personal individuality.\\" Copping was under contract to the Religious Tract Society (RTS) to produce 12 religious paintings a year up until the time of his death. He was paid ¬£50 for each painting and, under the terms of the contract, was not allowed to paint religious paintings for any other publisher. Copping's 'The Hope of the World' (1915) His illustrations for non-religious books included Hammond's Hard Lines (1894), Miss Bobbie (1897), Millionaire (1898), A Queen Among Girls (1900), The Pilgrim's Progress (1903), Westward Ho! (1903), Grace Abounding (1905), Three School Chums (1907), Little Women (1912), Good Wives (1913), A Christmas Carol (1920) and Character Sketches from Boz (1924).Copping on 'Spartacus Educational' He also illustrated the children's books by Mary Angela Dickens based on the novels of her grandfather, Charles Dickens. These included Children's Stories from Dickens (1911) and Dickens' Dream Children (1926). He also illustrated a number of stories set in fictional British public schools, including Boys of the Priory School (1900) and The Boys of Wynport School (1916).'Illustrators: Harold Copping (England, 1863‚Äì1932)' on 'Historical Boys Clothing' website Copping's illustrations were also published in such periodicals as The Leisure Hour, Little Folks, Pearson's Magazine, The Royal Magazine, The Temple Magazine and The Windsor Magazine. A trip to Canada inspired the collection of watercolour sketches Canadian Pictures. Copping married Violet Amy Prout (1865‚Äì1894) in 1888, and their children were Ernest Noel Copping (1889‚Äì1978), Romney Copping (1891‚Äì1910) and Violet Copping (1891‚Äì1892). Following his wife's death aged only 29, Copping married Edith Louise Mothersill (born 1876) in 1897 and had children Joyce Copping (1901‚Äì1934) and John Clarence Copping (1914‚Äì1977). He lived for many years at 'The Studio' in Shoreham in Kent, and here he died on 1 July 1932 aged 68. He was buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul in Shoreham.

The attack  Kornet missile and launcher On 7 April 2011 a bright yellow school bus belonging to the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council was dropping off students near their homes when a Hamas missile hit the rear of the bus. The bus was 50 metres past its stop at Kibbutz Sa'ad. All the children had been dropped off apart from Daniel Viflic, a 16-year-old yeshiva student from Beit Shemesh. He was critically injured by shrapnel which penetrated his brain. Viflic also suffered shrapnel wounds to head, neck and body, and massive blood loss.

Aftermath  Fears that the attack would lead to a second Gaza War did not materialize, but the incident was followed by a several-day stretch of violence in which Palestinians launched over 100 projectiles at Israel in which no Israelis were killed, and at least 20 Israeli strikes from its army, navy, and air force that left 19 dead and at least 45 wounded in Gaza by the time hostilities had ceasedGaza: Israel Kills 12 Amid Cross-border Exchanges, BBC News, (as revised) 9 April 2011IDF refrains from response to Gaza rocket fire as border violence cools, Haaretz. 11 April 2011 Reports varied widely as to how many of the people killed were civilians versus militants: Haaretz said just two were civilians, AFP reported while the violence was still ongoing that seven civilians were killed, and the BBC just said that \\"many\\" were. The dead in Gaza included a mother and her 21-year-old daughter, a policeman, and a 10-year-old boy. Agence France-Presse reported that the interval following the bus attack included \\"the deadliest 24 hours of violence in the Strip since the end of the Gaza war\\" two years previously. After meeting with other militant groups, Hamas agreed to enforce a ceasefire if Israel stopped firing, but both sides continued to fire. The Israeli Air Force bombed two smuggling tunnels in the northern Gaza Strip, injuring four people. Rocket and mortar fire from Gaza began a few hours later, and at least 45 additional Palestinian projectiles were fired into Israel over a three-hour period. No one was killed, but residents were instructed to stay inside their homes, children were ordered to stay inside schools, and police sealed roads in the area for fear of additional attacks.3 more Kassams fired from Gaza; no injuries reported, Jerusalem Post 7 April 2011 One mortar shell damaged a home in the Eshkol Regional Council, but caused no injuries. A Grad rocket fired at Ashkelon was intercepted by an Iron Dome battery, marking the first successful interception of a short-range rocket in history. Immediately afterward, an Israeli aircraft fired at the militant squad that had launched the rocket, and confirmed a hit. The Israeli Air Force and Israeli Navy launched missile attacks on targets in Gaza, while the Israeli Army attacked Palestinian targets with artillery and tank fire.Iron Dome intercepts rockets fired at Ashkelon, Israel News 8 April 2011 News agency Agence France-Presse reported that the effect of Israel's actions included \\"the deadliest 24 hours of violence\\" in Gaza since the Gaza War had ended, two years previously. Israeli forces had conducted more than 20 strikes by the following day. Palestinian militants fired 6 rockets and 24 mortar shells at Israel. An Iron Dome battery intercepted three rockets fired at Ashkelon; a fourth landed in an open field near the city. An Israeli aircraft fired at the Hamas cell that had launched the rockets and scored a direct hit. Israeli aircraft bombed two Palestinian militant cells east of Khan Yunis as they fired mortars at Israel. Palestinian casualties stood at 14 dead and 45 wounded. At least five were Hamas militants, and one was a policeman. Among the civilians reported killed in Gaza were a mother and her 21-year-old daughter. The Israeli military admitted that civilians had been apparently harmed in its attacks, saying that \\"Hamas chooses to operate from within civilian populations and uses them as human shields\\".\\"11 Palestinians die as Israeli planes, tanks hit Gaza\\", AFP.

The Act is still in force in the United Kingdom. It created a law that enabled enclosure of land, at the same time removing the right of commoners' access.  Effect  The Act required the procedure to start with a petition delivered to Parliament signed by the landowner, tithe holders and a majority of people affected. The petition then went through the stages of a bill with a committee meeting to hear any objections. The petition would then go through to Royal Assent after passing through both Houses of Parliament. Commissioners would then visit the area and distribute the land accordingly. The powers granted in the Inclosure Act were often abused by landowners: the preliminary meetings where enclosure was discussed, intended to be held in public, were often made in the presence of only the local landowners. They regularly chose their own solicitors, surveyors and Commissioners to decide on each case. In 1774, Parliament added an amendment to the Act under the Standing Orders that every petition for enclosure had to be affixed to the door of the local church for three consecutive Sundays in August or September. The Act eventually limited the amount of traffic on culverted paths as they often fell within land that was to be enclosed. This often meant that traffic eventually stopped going along certain routes such as the culverted path next to Shit Brook in Much Wenlock.

It aired May 10, 2011 on Fox in the United States. The episode was written by series creator Ian Brennan, directed by Eric Stoltz, and featured the return of guest star Jonathan Groff. In \\"Prom Queen\\", the McKinley High School glee club New Directions is tapped to provide the music for the school's junior prom. The episode shows the myriad dramas surrounding a high school prom, with the high- stakes race for prom king and queen that involves five members of the glee club, students scrambling to find dates and outfits, and the delights and disappointments of the prom itself. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 9.29 million American viewers and garnered a 3.7/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership was up slightly from the previous episode, \\"Rumours\\". The episode received mixed reviews, which generally favored the final segment with the prom king and queen denouement over the earlier portions of the show. The music, however, was mostly received with enthusiasm, and special praise was given to the pre-prom renditions of \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" and \\"Isn't She Lovely\\". Six songs were covered, all of which were released as singles and charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Plot As the McKinley High junior prom approaches, Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) are front-runners to be crowned prom king and queen. Contender Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman (Mark Salling) learns that his relationship with Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) has damaged his bad boy reputation, and resolves to restore it by spiking the prom punch bowl. Meanwhile, Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) intensify their election efforts with their anti-bullying group, the Bully Whips. Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) asks the school glee club, New Directions, to perform at the prom. Dateless members Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) decide to attend as a group on a budget. Rachel's ex-boyfriend Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) returns and sings an impromptu duet of \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" with her. He apologizes for treating her badly, and joins her prom group. Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) asks Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) to the prom; Blaine reveals that he was beaten up after a formal dance at his old school shortly after coming out, but agrees to go. He and Kurt's father Burt (Mike O'Malley) express misgivings about Kurt's daring homemade prom outfit, which includes a kilt, but Kurt is determined to be himself and wear it. Pleased by the sudden absence of homophobic bullying at school, Kurt suggests that his former tormentor Karofsky should consider coming out. Karofsky refuses, but makes a tearful apology to Kurt. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) asks his ex-girlfriend Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) to prom by serenading her with \\"Isn't She Lovely?\\", but she declines, and Artie joins Puck in planning to spike the punch. At the prom, the two of them and Sam sing \\"Friday\\". Rachel performs \\"Jar of Hearts\\", and Blaine, backed up by Brittany and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz), sings \\"I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance with You\\". Upset by Jesse's reunion with Rachel, Finn starts a fight with him. The two are ejected by Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), who also catches Artie pouring liquid into the punch. Artie refuses to implicate Puck in the wrongdoing, and ultimately confesses to using non-alcoholic lemonade. Karofsky is elected prom king, and non-candidate Kurt is elected prom queen. Kurt runs from the gym in humiliation and is consoled by Blaine. Distressed at having lost, Quinn slaps Rachel, though she immediately regrets it, while Santana is comforted by Brittany, who tells her to be herself rather than hide her lesbian identity. Kurt is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment‚Äî\\"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton\\"‚Äîgarners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with another boy in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's suggestion that he come out then and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on the dance floor. Blaine asks Kurt to dance with him, and they are soon joined by the rest of the student body. Production Jesse St. James (Groff), who was the star of rival show choir Vocal Adrenaline and appeared in several episodes to romance Rachel during the first season prior to breaking up with her shortly before the Regionals competition, returned in this episode. Quinn's mother Judy Fabray (Charlotte Ross) also returned. Other recurring characters who appeared included glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans (Overstreet) and Lauren Zizes (Fink), Principal Figgins (Theba), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), Kurt's boyfriend Blaine Anderson (Criss) and former school bully Dave Karofsky (Adler). Adler felt that the episode was the first time viewers saw Karofsky's true self. Following its broadcast, he recounted receiving messages from people who had been inspired to come out, and commented, \\"I can't believe that this episode of television is seriously changing some lives. It's an incredible experience.\\" On April 17, 2011, an extra named Nicole Crowther revealed the prom king and queen result on the social networking Twitter. Co-creator Brad Falchuk replied to her, \\"hope you're qualified to do something besides work in entertainment. Who are you to spoil something talented people have spent months to create?\\" As a result, Crowther was reportedly fired from the show, however, Crowther later claimed that she had not been a Glee extra since October 2010, and that she learned the spoiler from a dinner party and not on set. Following the scandal, speculation arose that the ending might be reshot when Monteith tweeted a photograph of himself standing next to Agron, who was wearing a tiara. The show did not comment on this, though Crowther stated that Glee would not be reshooting. The prom itself took three very long days to shoot, according to Criss, and involved a lot of hard work, though he added that it was \\"so much fun\\" and the actors and extras involved \\"had a blast.\\" In the original script, Kurt was persuaded to attend his coronation by Blaine. Colfer requested that Kurt \\"do that for himself and not be persuaded by a second party\\", and events were duly changed. The actor had serious reservations about the episode, and called it \\"the most difficult\\" he had worked on; he explained that the combination of Kurt as prom queen, wearing a kilt and tiara and dancing to \\"Dancing Queen\\" caused him concern that \\"they were just pushing it way too much\\", and that Kurt's \\"helpful and progressive\\" depiction would be tarnished. Once completed, Colfer conceded, \\"it did turn out to be a beautiful episode. I was so wrong.\\" The episode featured six musical cover versions. Criss performed \\"I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance with You\\" by Black Kids. Rebecca Black's \\"Friday\\" was performed by Salling, McHale and Overstreet. Series co-creator Ryan Murphy explained the use of the viral hit as a tribute to popular culture. Michele and Groff covered John Legend's a cappella arrangement of Adele's \\"Rolling in the Deep\\". Stevie Wonder's \\"Isn't She Lovely?\\" sung by McHale, Christina Perri's \\"Jar of Hearts\\" sung by Michele, and ABBA's \\"Dancing Queen\\" performed by Riley and Rivera were also featured. All six songs were released as singles, available for digital download. Reception =Ratings= \\"Prom Queen\\" was first broadcast on May 10, 2011 in the United States on Fox. It garnered a 3.7/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and received 9.29 million American viewers during its initial airing. It ranked as the second most-watched scripted show of the week among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The total viewership for this episode was up from the previous episode, \\"Rumours\\"‚Äîwhich was watched by 8.85 million American viewers upon first airing‚Äîthough the rating/share remained flat. The episode's Canadian broadcast, also on May 10, 2011, drew 1.82 million viewers and placed sixteenth in the weekly program rankings. Again, viewership increased on \\"Rumours\\", which was watched by 1.49 million viewers and ranked eighteenth. In the UK, where the episode aired on May 23, 2011, it was watched by 2.11 million viewers, which made it the most-watched show on cable for the week. Here too, Glee gained viewers from the previous episode's 2.07 million, which was the second most-watched cable program. In Australia, \\"Prom Queen\\" attracted 1.04 million viewers on June 1, 2011, and was the eighth most-watched program of the night and twenty-sixth of the week. This was again up from \\"Rumours\\", which received 959,000 viewers, and was the twelfth most-watched show of the night and thirty-second of the week. =Critical response= The episode received a somewhat positive reaction from reviewers. IGN Robert Canning was representative of this, and gave it a \\"good\\" rating of 7.5 out of 10: \\"The episode as a whole was fine for what it was, touching on most of the hallmarks of a decent prom episode\\", though he \\"was a bit let down by the final moments of the episode as [he] felt it too quickly tried to pin a happy ending on everything\\". He also called the drama around Rachel and Jesse and Quinn and Finn \\"superficial stuff\\", a view shared by Meghan Brown of The Atlantic who said much of the drama \\"felt shallow and forced\\", except for the first Kurt and Karofsky scene, which she described as \\"painful and poignant\\". Brown's colleague, Kevin Fallon, stated that \\"Like prom, this episode was Glee at its best and its worst\\", and MTV Aly Semigran thought that it \\"wasn't as strong‚Äîor cohesive‚Äîas last week's 'Rumours, but said it \\"certainly had its moments, especially some notably hilarious ones.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote, \\"If the entirety of this show were like the last 10 minutes of this episode, it just might be the best show on TV.\\" As much as VanDerWerff liked \\"Rolling in the Deep\\", he felt the return of Jesse and its resulting storyline \\"was a mess\\" and \\"just didn't work\\". Canning was little moved by the drama surrounding Jesse and Rachel, or the resulting brawl and slap, and Brown thought these developments \\"lacked any real emotional stakes, and seemed tonally inconsistent with the snarky snap of the rest of the episode\\". VanDerWerff found the otherwise excellent final segment marred by Quinn's regression to a \\"generic bitchy cheerleader\\" stereotype, which he was saddened by as Agron is among his favorite Glee performers. Sue's scenes drew little response. Canning referred to her \\"unfunny torture bits\\" and called the idea \\"too over-the-top to actually work\\", though Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times was happy to get \\"more great lines from Sue, who was the right blend of evil and funny\\". VanDerWerff felt that her role was too prominent, and that the Puck and Artie storyline, with the exception of Artie trying to make up with Brittany, was \\"fairly painful\\". Colfer as Kurt received kudos in most reviews. Semigran wrote, \\"I give Chris Colfer all the credit in the world, because no matter what the material, he knocks it out of the park every time.\\" James Poniewozik of Time agreed that given the episode's material, \\"it's important to have it in the hands of an actor as good as Chris Colfer\\". The scene with Kurt, Burt, Finn and Blaine was singled out by Jenna Mullins of E! Online, who observed that it \\"quickly turned into much more than just prom ensembles. It's the jumps from quirky to heavy that make Glee special, and I love watching the cast handle so much in one scene.\\" Although Canning said that the announcement of Kurt as prom queen \\"effectively caught [him] off guard, right in the gut, as good TV should\\", others were critical of the story at that moment, including Brown, who said that there was no logic to Kurt's victory, no explanation of how it might have happened, and no sense in Figgins acceding to it. Semigran and VanDerWerff also called Figgins's actions into question. The sequence after the announcement was lauded by Fallon and Canning, who were impressed by the spliced presentation of multiple aftermaths. Poniewozik said it led to the episode's \\"theme of community‚Äîthat is, that not all these characters' problems may be equal, but that they're best able to handle them when they recognize what they have in common. Everyone ... can feel like an outsider on prom night.\\" VanDerWerff also talked about the sense of community, which \\"has mostly been absent in season two\\", and noted that \\"Glee somehow found a way to show off the best AND worst of high school and worked past its own storytelling issues to capture raw emotion.\\" =Music and performances= The musical performances in \\"Prom Queen\\" were praised more than the episode itself. Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times called it \\"the best musical night this show's had in eight months\\", and Fallon characterized the numbers as \\"pretty darned good\\". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair had the opposite view: he gave three of the six songs a single star out of five, his lowest grade, and two more only received two stars.\\" \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" as sung by Rachel and Jesse received considerable praise, though Berk gave it a single star because it was an Adele song, and Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez would have given it an \\"A\\" if she had \\"never heard the Adele version\\", but as she had, gave it a \\"B‚àí\\" instead. Among the many favorable comments, John Kubicek of BuddyTV called it \\"one of the best vocal performances this show has ever seen\\". Benigno complimented Groff and Michele's \\"fantastic voices\\", gave the song an \\"A\\" and wrote simply, \\"they crush it\\". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman called the performance a \\"passion-filled winner\\", though she detected \\"some oversinging\\". \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" was as enthusiastically received‚Äîit was Brown's \\"favorite number\\", and she added that Artie's \\"voice sounded great\\". It was also Berk's favorite; he commented, \\"I still melt at Artie's serenade\\", and gave it four stars out of five. Gonzalez and Benigno both gave it an \\"A\\", and the latter explained: \\"the arrangement ... gives the track a wonderful, spontaneous feel\\", and \\"this nerdy white boy has himself some soul.\\" Kubicek dissented, and explained that Artie getting emotional in song two weeks in a row \\"is a tad boring\\". While most reviewers disliked \\"Friday\\" in the original, Rebecca Black version, the commentary for the prom incarnation sung by Puck, Sam and Artie was generally positive despite this‚ÄîGonzalez said she hated herself \\"for giving this horrendously addictive version of a horrendous song a B.\\" VanDerWerff said the song was \\"way, way, way too long, though it was more fun than [he] expected it to be\\", Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called it \\"darn good and infectious\\", and Mullins said it was \\"much catchier than the original\\". Benigno gave the song an \\"A‚àí\\", and called it a \\"rafter- raiser\\". The remaining songs were reviewed less widely. \\"Jar of Hearts\\" was praised by Mullins as an \\"absolutely beautiful performance\\", and Fallon said it was \\"haunting and filmed gorgeously\\". Kubicek wrote, \\"it's nice to just hear her sing a song\\", and also stated that the two songs Rachel sang in the episode were \\"two of [his] favorite songs from the entire season\\". Benigno gave it a \\"B\\", his lowest grade of the night, and asked the show to \\"stop doing these numbers\\": \\"We get it. She's in pain and she can sing. Move on.\\" He gave \\"I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance With You\\" an \\"A\\", and questioned why it had taken so long for Criss to receive numbers independent of the Warblers. Kubicek wrote that it was \\"Blaine doing what Blaine does best: fun bubblegum pop\\", but Gonzalez was surprised that she did not love it and gave it a \\"B\\", as she \\"really missed the backing of Blaine's Warbler cohorts.\\" The use of \\"Dancing Queen\\" as the song for Kurt's dance was questioned by Benigno, who called it \\"borderline poor taste\\", and by VanDerWerff, who felt it was not the \\"deftest of musical choices\\"‚ÄîVanDerWerff was also critical of the illogic behind Santana singing the song for the king- and-queen dance when she was a known prom queen candidate‚Äîthough Benigno nevertheless gave the song an \\"A\\", and Gonzalez gave it an \\"A‚àí\\". Some reviewers criticized the performance on musical grounds: Kubicek called it \\"a simple karaoke version\\", and lamented that it suffered in comparison to the previous Santana and Mercedes duet, \\"River Deep ‚Äì Mountain High\\", while Futterman faulted the arrangement, which \\"waters down power vocals\\", and gave the duo \\"the thin sound of Abba's original even though they're both much better than that.\\" =Chart history= All six of the cover versions featured debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and most featured on other musical charts. On the Hot 100, the show's rendition of \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" debuted at number twenty-nine, in the same week that Adele's original version remained at the top of the same chart.Peak chart positions for season 2 singles in the United States: \\"Rolling In The Deep\\", \\"Friday\\", \\"Jar Of Hearts\\", \\"Isn't She Lovely\\", and \\"I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How To Dance With You\\" It was at number thirty-one on the Canadian Hot 100. The cover of Rebecca Black's \\"Friday\\" was at number thirty-four on the Hot 100, and charted higher than Black's original, which peaked at number fifty-eight. It was number thirty- three on the Canadian Hot 100. The other four songs on the Hot 100 were \\"Jar Of Hearts\\" at number forty-nine, which also made number thirty-nine on the Canadian Hot 100; \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" at number sixty-five, which also made number eighty-three on the Canadian Hot 100; \\"I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How To Dance With You\\" at number seventy-two, which also made number eighty-seven on the Canadian Hot 100; and \\"Dancing Queen\\" at number seventy- four. Out of the six songs that were featured in the episode, three were featured on the eighth soundtrack album of the series, Glee: The Music, Volume 6: \\"Rolling In The Deep\\", \\"Isn't She Lovely\\", and \\"Dancing Queen\\".

It first aired May 17, 2011 on Fox in the United States, and was written by series creator Ryan Murphy and directed by Bradley Buecker. The episode featured Jonathan Groff guest starring as Jesse St. James, who is brought in as a consultant to help the New Directions glee club prepare for the National Show Choir competition. Sue Sylvester's (Jane Lynch) sister Jean (Robin Trocki) dies unexpectedly, and the glee club helps Sue plan her funeral. The episode received a wide range of reviews, from highly enthusiastic to harshly critical. The performances of the five songs covered were generally well- liked, though having four of them arranged as a series of auditions in the middle of the show met with disapproval. All five songs were released as singles, and three of them charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 8.97 million American viewers and garnered a 3.6/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were down slightly from the previous episode, \\"Prom Queen\\". Lynch was nominated for an Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards for her work on the show, and submitted this episode for judging. Plot Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), director of New Directions, the McKinley High School glee club, hires Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff)‚Äîan alumnus of championship-winning rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline‚Äîas a consultant to help them develop a strategy to win the upcoming Nationals competition. Jesse convinces Will to use Vocal Adrenaline's methodology, which is to identify the club's best performer and center the entire performance on that person, and Will decides to hold auditions to determine who will be featured. Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) all audition, with Jesse and Will as judges. Jesse is highly critical of the performances by Santana, Kurt and Mercedes, while he praises his former girlfriend Rachel's performance. He tells Will that Rachel is the clear winner, which angers the other three. Ultimately, Will decides to ignore Jesse's advice and instead plans to do for Nationals what brought them victory at the Regionals competition: having the whole group sing original songs. In this episode, Sue (Lynch, left) is thankful to Will (Morrison, right) for supporting her through her sister's funeral. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is deeply upset by the death of her sister, Jean (Robin Trocki). She lashes out by having the glee club's flight to Nationals in New York City rerouted so it has a layover in war-ravaged Tripoli and kicks Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) off the Cheerios. Sue allows Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) and Kurt to plan Jean's funeral and help her sort through Jean's personal belongings, and agrees to have the glee club to perform at the funeral, as she believes no one will attend otherwise. While going through Jean's belongings, Finn and Kurt discover that her favorite movie was Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, and arrange a funeral inspired by the film. At the funeral, an emotional Sue is unable to continue reading her eulogy after a few sentences, and Will reads the remainder for her. The glee club then sings \\"Pure Imagination\\", the theme song of the film. Touched by Will's support, Sue later tells him that he is a good friend and he has what Jean had and she does not: a pure heart. She says that she will no longer attempt to destroy the glee club, and announces that she is planning to run for the United States House of Representatives. For the first time, she wishes him good luck. Sue also apologizes to Becky, reinstates her as a member of the Cheerios, and tells her she will be captain of the squad in the fall. Sue asks for and receives a hug from Becky. Finn realizes his true feelings for Rachel during the funeral, and breaks up with Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) afterward. He later thanks her for not quitting glee club because of their breakup; Quinn tells him that quitting would have ruined her \\"big plans\\" for New York, and refuses to tell him what they are. Finn sees Jesse and Rachel sharing a brief kiss on stage; after they leave, he brings a flower from behind his back. Will's ex-wife, Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), who aided Sue's earlier plot to sabotage the glee club's flights, gives Will first-class plane tickets to New York for the entire club, revealing that they were a donation from an airline executive. She tells him she is moving to Miami to start over with her life and to pursue her retail management career, and they say goodbye. Production The episode was written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy and directed by Bradley Buecker. Two months before it aired, Murphy confirmed at PaleyFest 2011 that there was a death planned before the end of the season, but that it would not be recurring character Dave Karofsky, despite rumors that his death would be paving the way for Kurt's return to McKinley High. Further details were eventually supplied by entertainment reporter Michael Ausiello, who reported on April 19, 2011 that a \\"beloved character\\" would be dying in the \\"season's penultimate episode\\", and one week later that the character was female. Morrison confirmed in late April that there would indeed be a death, and added: \\"The episode right before the finale is called 'Funeral'. We were actually at a funeral home yesterday, shooting all day. It was a very taxing day.\\" The day the episode aired, Lynch revealed in an interview that Murphy had conferred with her before proceeding with the storyline: \\"He took me aside at a party and said 'I want your blessing on this before we move forward.' I said, 'It sounds like a really great storyline.' It‚Äôs the thing that will break Sue Sylvester‚Äôs heart and get to where she lives.\\" Lynch was nominated for an Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards for her work on the show, and submitted \\"Funeral\\" to be the episode by which she would be judged. Groff returns for the second of three consecutive episodes as Jesse. Terri's colleague Howard Bamboo (Kent Avenido) also returns, and makes his only appearance of the second season after having featured in several episodes during the first. Other recurring guest stars in the episode include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) and Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), and in an uncredited appearance in a video shown during the funeral scene, Sue's sister Jean Sylvester (Robin Trocki). Additional guests include Becky's mother Donna Jackson (Kari Coleman), and Jim Metzler as the Reverend who presides at the funeral. \\"Funeral\\" features cover versions of five songs: \\"Back to Black\\" by Amy Winehouse, sung by Rivera; \\"Some People\\" from Gypsy, performed by Colfer; \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" by Otis Redding, sung by Riley; \\"My Man\\" in the Barbra Streisand version from the film of Funny Girl, performed by Michele; and \\"Pure Imagination\\" from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, sung by New Directions. Reception =Ratings= \\"Funeral\\" was first broadcast on May 17, 2011 in the United States on Fox. It garnered a 3.6/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and received 8.97 million American viewers during its initial airing, despite airing simultaneously with the NCIS season finale on CBS, The Biggest Loser on NBC, Dancing With the Stars Freestyle Special on ABC, and the One Tree Hill season finale on The CW. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were down slightly from those of the previous episode, \\"Prom Queen\\"‚Äîwhich was watched by 9.29 million American viewers and acquired a 3.7/11 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic upon first airing on television. The episode's Canadian broadcast, also on May 17, 2011, drew 1.58 million viewers. It was the fourteenth most-watched show of the week, and ranked two places higher than the previous week's \\"Prom Queen\\", even though it drew 13% fewer viewers than the 1.82 million recorded for that episode. In Australia, the episode was watched by 1.07 million viewers on June 8, 2011, which made Glee the seventh most-watched show of the night and the twenty-first most-watched for the week. This was up slightly from \\"Prom Queen\\", which attracted 1.04 million viewers on June 1, 2011, and was the eighth most-watched program of the night and twenty-sixth of the week. In the UK, the episode debuted on June 7, 2011, and was watched by 2.19 million viewers (1.76 million on E4, and 427,000 on E4+1), which made it the most- watched show on E4 and E4+1 for the week, and the most-watched show on cable for the week. This was up slightly over \\"Prom Queen\\", which aired on May 23, 2011, and was watched by 2.11 million viewers, again the most-watched show on cable for the week. =Critical response= \\"Funeral\\" was met with a wide range of reviews, from highly enthusiastic to harshly critical. Lisa Respers France of CNN said it was \\"one of the best episodes ever\\", and MTV's Aly Semigran called it \\"authentic\\" and \\"one of the very best\\" of the season if not the series as a whole. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that it was \\"a great episode that truly showcased the talents of Jane Lynch\\" and rated it 8.5 out of 10. Rolling Stone Erica Futterman said that the episode \\"felt like a recycled version of things we've seen previously\\" and added that the show is \\"not as entertaining when it's simply a showcase\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"C\\" and characterized the funeral scene as \\"the highlight of an uneven episode\\". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon wrote, \\"Killing off Sue's sister seemed cruel, but ultimately paid off‚Äîit's too bad the episode completely derailed afterward, dying its own rapid death in turn.\\" Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times had little good to say, and singled out the writers for doing \\"such a crappy job\\" on the penultimate episode of the season. Lynch as Sue received high praise for her acting. Canning wrote that she \\"stole the episode\\" and \\"perfectly portrayed a woman [whose] hard heart was trying terribly not to break, but not being able to stop it.\\" BuddyTV John Kubicek stated, \\"it's impossible for me to say that Lynch wasn't exceptional, because her slow breakdown and attempt to cover-up her emotions was well done and fit perfectly with the character.\\" Respers France commented that \\"we got to see the range and complexity of Sue Sylvester\\", and Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly said that Lynch did an \\"outstanding job of delivering even the funniest quips with an underlying sense of sadness\\". Sue's characterization in the series was criticized by several reviewers, however. Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times stated that the \\"consistent inconsistency of Sue's character is wearing thin\\", and that \\"our sense of her fails to advance, wandering endlessly between pure evil and pure love for her sister.\\" Futterman called the episode a \\"too-little-too late attempt at redemption for Sue's poor characterization this season.\\" VanDerWerff wrote that the episode \\"feels very self-consciously like a way to just remove her character from the table for the season finale\\", that \\"it feels very self-consciously like an attempt by the show to address the fact that the character doesn't make any sense\\", and criticized the death of Jean: \\"killing her solely to right a wayward character arc is lazy writing, and no amount of actor commitment can wholly save it.\\" Fallon described the funeral plot line as \\"pure, classic Glee: Egregiously random, emotionally manipulative, wholly unnecessary to plot development, and, in the end, deeply moving.\\" The secondary plot line, about the auditions for New Directions soloist at Nationals, was roundly criticized. Canning called it a \\"faux drama\\", though he added that Jesse was \\"a delight to despise\\", and VanDerWerff said it was \\"completely ridiculous to do this with Nationals coming up\\" in a week's time, and \\"constructed almost entirely\\" to make Jesse a \\"jerk\\". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also hit on the lack of preparation for the upcoming competition and stated that it seemed \\"like a very bad idea\\" to be going without a setlist already decided on, much less with songs unwritten. He said the four audition numbers were \\"awkwardly paced\\", though he thought they were \\"fantastic\\"; Reiter said they \\"stood out like glinting gems in a somewhat muddy episode\\". Canning and VanDerWerff also criticized the block of four songs in the middle of the episode which, as VanDerWerff put it, \\"stops the show cold\\". James Poniewozik of Time was unhappy for another reason altogether: \\"Having four people stand up and sing solos into a microphone may be music; but it ain't a musical.\\" Poniewozik wrote of Will's Broadway plans that \\"his ambitions, and guilt over them, make a much more believable and compelling conflict than Matthew Morrison has had to convey for much of the season.\\" VanDerWerff complimented Morrison on his portrayal of Will: \\"every time the show hands him anything to play that's something that makes vague sense, he does a good job with it.\\" Other kudos for the actors were provided by Respers France, who highlighted the \\"further great acting\\" seen during \\"Finn and Quinn's moment in his truck\\", and E! Online Jenna Mullins, who called the scene where Finn and Kurt help Sue with her sister's room \\"positively heartbreaking\\", and the trio of characters \\"magnificent\\". Although Canning stated that \\"Terri leaving lacked much punch\\", Poniewozik commented that it was \\"satisfying to see her realized as an adult for once\\". =Musical commentary= While the placement of the four solos together in the middle of the episode was questioned, the songs themselves were met with approbation: VanDerWerff called all four \\"really good performances\\". Santana's rendition of \\"Back to Black\\" was declared \\"spot on\\" by Futterman, and Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal wrote that it was performed \\"with raspy sensitivity\\", and went \\"deep into the emotional truth of the song\\". Kubicek was less enthusiastic, and called it \\"pretty good, but nothing groundbreaking or special\\", and Semigran called it \\"decent\\". Benigno said that \\"Rivera's delivery gives this song its smoldering swagger\\" and gave it an \\"A‚àí\\", and Poniewozik praised Rivera as \\"really impressive\\". \\"Some People\\" received adequate to good reviews. Gonzalez missed Kurt's usual charisma and thought the performance \\"a bit lackluster\\", and Benigno called it \\"kind of a boring cover\\". It received their lowest grades of the show, \\"B\\" and \\"B‚àí\\", respectively. Kubicek stated, \\"Kurt has a unique voice that sounds positively beautiful with the right melodic song, but this is a terrible song for his style\\", and Vanity Fair Brett Berk added, after he gave it two out of five stars, that it was \\"not the best showcase of Kurt's talents\\". Futterman and Reiter referred approvingly to Kurt's \\"upper register\\", and both Reiter and Respers France said he \\"ripped it\\" on his song. \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" received a stream of bouquets from the critics. Kubicek raved that Mercedes \\"gave 100% of what she has to offer, which is pure greatness\\", and Respers France said she \\"stole the night\\" and was \\"amazing\\". Berk broke his own scale of one to five stars with six stars, and praised \\"the unstinting instrument that is Mercedes' voice\\". Gonzalez gave it an \\"A\\" and called it \\"pure perfection\\", but Benigno was more restrained with a \\"B+\\", and wrote \\"she hits a little too hard for my taste\\" and \\"the vocals ‚Ä¶ threaten to engulf the song itself\\". \\"My Man\\" was also lauded. Flandez called it \\"heartstopping\\", and Futterman summed up with, \\"she nails the Funny Girl closer, making it one of Rachel's top performances on the show\\". Berk called it \\"good singing\\" and gave it three stars out of five, and Gonzalez gave it an \\"A‚àí\\". Benigno was more generous with an \\"A\\" grade, and said, \\"even by Lea Michele's standards, the vocals here are fan-fucking-tastic\\". Hankinson agreed: \\"Rachel truly nailed the most difficult song she's ever sung.\\" The one group number, \\"Pure Imagination\\", received reviews that touched on the song itself as much as the performance. Fallon called it \\"unsettling yet touching\\" and Poniewozik described it as \\"odd but perfect\\". Berk, on the other hand, characterized it as \\"pure dreck\\". Benigno felt that while the song was \\"really quite good\\", the \\"stupidity of the scene\\" it was in detracted from it, resulting in a grade of \\"B+\\", while Gonzalez, when she gave it an \\"A‚àí\\", said she hadn't been a \\"huge fan of the cover\\" when she heard it before the show aired, but it grew on her in context. Futterman wrote, \\"The New Directions break into a restrained, tender take on \\"Pure Imagination\\" with lush harmonies on the chorus that's exactly right for the moment.\\" =Chart history= Only three of the five cover versions debuted on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Pure Imagination\\" debuted at number fifty-nine, \\"Back to Black\\" at number eighty-two, and \\"My Man\\" at number ninety-four.Peak chart positions for season 2 singles in the United States: \\"Pure Imagination\\", \\"Back to Black\\", and \\"My Man\\" \\"Pure Imagination\\" was the only song to make the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 at number eighty- seven. Of the five songs that were featured in the episode, three were featured on the eighth soundtrack album of the series, Glee: The Music, Volume 6: \\"Pure Imagination\\", \\"My Man\\", and \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\". The album was released on May 23, 2011, and debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200, selling 80,000 copies in its first week, which was the second-lowest opening sales figure for a Glee release next to the extended play Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show, and lower than the 86,000 sold by Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers in its first week the previous month. The album was also at number four on the Canadian Album charts.

Cray was a right-handed batsman and known to fellow players as Chick. He was born in Stratford, Essex. Cray made his first-class debut for Essex against Worcestershire in the 1938 County Championship. He became a regular in the Essex team in 1939, but the start of the Second World War abruptly ended his first-class career with Essex in its tracks. Serving in the war, Cray served in the British Raj, while stationed there he played two first-class matches for a Services XI against an Indian XI and a Bengal Governor's XI, both in 1944. Following the war, Cray returned to Essex, where he played first-class cricket once more from 1946 to 1950. As well as his appearances for Essex and a Services XI, he also played a single first-class match for a combined Essex and Middlesex team against a combined Surrey and Kent team in 1947. Cray was a member of the Essex team which tied with Northamptonshire in 1947, a match in which he scored a century in the Essex first-innings. In total he made 99 first-class appearances for the county, scoring 4,062 runs at a batting average of 24.46, with sixteen half centuries, seven centuries and a high score of 163. His highest first-class score came against Nottinghamshire in 1950. Cray passed 1,000 runs for a season twice, in 1947 and 1949. Following the 1950 season, Cray coached in South Africa when out of the blue he received a phonecall informing him his services were no longer required by Essex. Following his release he played Minor Counties Championship cricket for Devon on two occasions, firstly in 1954 against the Surrey Second XI and secondly against Oxfordshire in 1957. While in Devon he was the professional at Paignton Cricket Club. He retired fully from playing and coaching in 1961, following problems with a hand injury he had sustained in a car accident. He had a number of jobs outside of cricket, including as a postman and a kitchen assistant. One of the few cricketers to have played first-class cricket before the war, Cray died in Torquay, Devon on 10 October 2008.

The definitive title of Gobseck would appear in 1842 in the Furne edition of La Com√©die humaine. Plot Summary The plot of Gobseck, set during the French Restoration, is framed within a conversation between lawyer Ma√Ætre Derville and Vicomtesse de Grandlieu. Derville tells a story which focuses on Anastasie de Restaud, n√©e Goriot. Anastasie de Restaud is the daughter of a rich bourgeois who has married into the aristocracy, but is bored by her marriage, which is loveless and passionless.Patricia Mainardi, Husbands, wives, and lovers: marriage and its discontents in nineteenth- century France (Yale University Press, 2003), 169. Anastasie de Restaud has an affair with Maxime de Trailles, and spends her fortune on de Trailles. She turns to the usurer Jean-Esther van Gobseck for financial assistance. Ma√Ætre Derville acts as Gobseck‚Äôs lawyer while Derville's future wife is also one of Gobseck's debtors. Anastasie's husband finds out about her debts, so he signs a convoluted contract with Gobseck which is supposed to benefit his and Anastasie's children. However, Anastasie destroys that contract during her irrational schemings. Subsequently, both Anastasie's marriage is destroyed and her family fortune is lost. Eventually, elderly Gobseck gains an even larger fortune through factoring. Shortly after his death, Derville discovers many treasures in Gobseck's home, including loads of spoiled food which Gobseck had intended to sell.

Keyes was the executive director of Advancing Human Rights, the co-founder of CyberDissidents.org, and the head of Movements.org, a platform for crowdsourcing human rights. The New York Times called Keyes \\"a pioneer in online activism.\\" From 2016 to 2018, Keyes was the foreign media advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu praised Keyes for his \\"great contribution to Israel's information effort\\" and his \\"groundbreaking videos\\" that were viewed by millions of people. Israeli political commentator Amit Segal said that Keyes was \\"responsible for one of the biggest new media achievements in history.\\"  Early life  Keyes was born in Los Angeles, California. He attended Shalhevet High School and University High School. In his youth, he was a top-ranked tennis player in California and played in the junior national championships. He once trained with Andre Agassi and wanted to be a professional tennis player. Keyes graduated with honors from the University of California in Los Angeles with a degree in Middle Eastern studies. While in college, he ran a group called Students Against Dictators and wrote for the UCLA newspaper, the Daily Bruin. In 2004, Keyes conducted research at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, where he specialized in terrorism and assisted Dore Gold, Israel's former ambassador to the United Nations. In 2005, Keyes was a research intern at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. After immigrating to Israel, Keyes served in the Strategic Division of the Israel Defense Forces and completed a master's degree in diplomacy at Tel Aviv University. He is fluent in Hebrew and Arabic.  Career  = Human rights activism = While working for former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky in Israel, Keyes founded CyberDissidents.org, a site meant to \\"highlight the voices of democratic online activists in the Middle East.\\" CyberDissidents was a database and a platform for dissidents who wanted to reach a wider audience. Keyes was a keynote speaker at a conference on internet freedom organized by former President George W. Bush. In his speech, Keyes explained his agenda: to make dissidents famous. In 2008, Keyes organized a protest at the Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv to decry the ongoing detention of Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer. The assistant Egyptian consul emerged to speak with the protesters and claimed he had no knowledge of Amer's imprisonment. In February 2010, Keyes published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal criticizing the ban on YouTube in Turkey. Keyes wrote that Turkey's status as a \\"European Capital of Culture\\" should be suspended until the YouTube ban was repealed. The op-ed sparked a protest movement for free speech in Turkey after it was reprinted in Turkish media. In October 2010, the Turkish government lifted the YouTube ban but continues to periodically restrict access to the site. In 2010, Keyes was approached by Robert L. Bernstein, the founder of Human Rights Watch. Bernstein was interested in finding new ways to open closed societies. Bernstein said Keyes was \\"a source of knowledge about all issues in the Middle East.\\" Bernstein saw potential in CyberDissidents and asked Keyes to help establish a new group called Advancing Human Rights. In 2011, Keyes proposed holding a Saudi Women's Grand Prix in order to protest the ban on women driving in the kingdom. In Saudi Arabia, women have been sentenced to lashings for driving a car. Keyes said that the goal of his campaign was to encourage the Saudi king to empower Saudi women and allow them to leave home without a man's permission. Keyes became well known in Saudi Arabia for being behind the campaign to allow Saudi women to drive. During an interview on MSNBC, Keyes displayed a whip that Saudi authorities use to lash women who are convicted of leaving home without a male relative. The senior editor of Commentary called Keyes' campaign for Saudi women's rights \\"the cleverest human-rights campaign of 2011.\\" In 2012, Keyes became the head of Movements, an online platform for human rights activists founded in 2008 by Jared Cohen, the director of Google Ideas. Cohen said his group was looking for a partner and reviewed many human rights organizations before approaching Keyes. Cohen said he was impressed with Keyes' \\"phenomenal network of cyberactivists in the Middle East and North Africa.\\" With Keyes at the helm, Movements declared June 2013 to be \\"Dictator Appreciation Month\\" ‚Äì an initiative that highlighted human rights activists who use satire to make fun of oppressive regimes. Keyes reintroduced Movements in 2014 as a platform for crowdsourcing human rights. Less than one year later, Tablet magazine wrote that what Movements did for human rights was \\"what Amazon did to shopping or Craigslist to ads.\\" In 2013, Keyes confronted Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in New York about human rights in Iran. Keyes asked Zarif when Majid Tavakoli, one of Iran's most prominent student activists, would be freed from prison. Zarif responded: \\"I don't know him.\\" Soon after, thousands of Iranians took to social media to demand to know how it was possible that their foreign minister was unaware of his nation's most famous political prisoners. As a result of the uproar, Tavakoli was granted leave from prison. Keyes said he was \\"totally overjoyed\\" that his confrontation with Zarif led to Tavakoli's release. On 13 November 2013, Keyes co-authored an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal with Garry Kasparov, a former presidential candidate in Russia and former world chess champion. The article launched Keyes' new initiative, Dissident Squared, to rename the streets in front of the embassies of dictatorships after political prisoners. The Daily Beast cited Keyes as the \\"brainchild\\" of Dissident Squared and said it had \\"earned the support of major human rights luminaries and fighters for freedom around the world.\\" In 2014, Keyes was the driving force behind the bipartisan effort in Congress to rename the street address of the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC, to No. 1 Liu Xiaobo Plaza, after the famed Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner. The regime of Xi Jinping became obsessed with the possibility that Congress would pass legislation renaming the street. The Washington Post reported that Chinese officials demanded that the U.S. administration bury the bill. The issue threatened to become a major irritant in U.S.-China relations.  Satirical stunts  Keyes is a fellow at the Disruptor Foundation, an organization whose mission is to raise awareness of disruptive innovation theory and encourage its application in order to bring about changes in society. In 2015, Keyes increased his use of humor and satire in order to highlight the human rights records of oppressive regimes. He published a number of videos documenting his \\"punkings\\" of Saudi and Iranian diplomats. In April 2015, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif gave a talk at New York University. Outside the hall, Keyes led a \\"celebration\\" of a milestone: Iran hanging 1,000 prisoners in 18 months. Keyes parked a van on the street and offered free ice cream to passers-by. The theme of the mock celebration was, \\"Free ice cream; free Iran‚Äôs political prisoners.\\" In May 2015, the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission announced that its annual job fair would be taking place at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center. Keyes used the opportunity to protest Saudi Arabia's treatment of homosexuals; he threw a \\"big gay party\\" in the lobby of the Gaylord. Keyes also prodded Saudi Arabia in a video called \\"Abdullah: Let Your Women Drive.\\" He delivered his address in fluent Arabic. In summer 2015, Keyes ambushed Iranian diplomats at the nuclear negotiations in Vienna and asked them on camera, \\"Who's your favorite political prisoner, if you could only pick one?\\" In a hallway inside the hotel, Keyes told Wendy Sherman, the chief US negotiator in Vienna, \\"Wendy, congrats on all the success of reducing the rate of hangings in Iran hopefully to only once every two-and-a-half hours.\\" After hearing Keyes' comment, Sherman dropped her purse. = Spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister = left Keyes looks on as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz sign a memorandum of understanding, 16 May 2016. In March 2016, Keyes was named the Prime Minister of Israel's spokesperson to foreign media. Keyes replaced Mark Regev, who became Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom. A senior official close to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actively recruited Keyes for the position. Before his appointment, Keyes was known as a \\"wunderkind of online activism.\\" Keyes boosted Netanyahu's performance on social media. Over the next few months, Netanyahu published a series of videos that garnered nearly 40 million views. The Jerusalem Post reported that Netanyahu's viral videos \\"bear the hallmark of David Keyes.\\" Keyes was credited with writing Netanyahu's viral video response to the Orlando nightclub shooting in June 2016. In the video, Netanyahu said the casualties were victims of homophobia and intolerance and called on people not to give in to \\"hate and fear.\\" Netanyahu called on people to embrace the LGBT community, \\"comfort them, tell them you stand together, we stand together as one, and that you will always remember the victims.\\" The Financial Times called the video \\"a masterclass in responding to tragedy.\\" The video was seen by more than 22 million people. It was by far the most-watched video statement ever put out by Netanyahu. In December 2016, Keyes said that Israel had \\"ironclad\\" information from sources in the Arab world that the Obama administration helped craft a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israel for housing construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem and \\"pushed hard\\" to ensure its passage. Keyes said on CNN that it was outrageous that the Security Council resolution considered the Western Wall to be part of \\"occupied Palestinian territory.\\" In February 2018, an armed Iranian drone infiltrated Israeli airspace from Syria and was shot down by the Israel Air Force. Keyes proposed that Netanyahu display a piece of the drone at the upcoming Munich Security Conference. Keyes stashed the drone piece under the podium before Netanyahu's speech. While delivering his remarks, Netanyahu brandished the wing flap from the Iranian drone and taunted the Iranian foreign minister. \\"Mr. Zarif, do you recognize this?\\" Netanyahu asked. \\"You should. It's yours.\\" Netanyahu's dramatic display grabbed headlines around the world and inspired memes on social media. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called Netanyahu's prop a \\"cartoonish circus\\" that \\"does not even deserve the dignity of a response.\\" Netanyahu said the fact that Zarif was forced to respond was \\"the whole point\\" of the display and a public relations win. Keyes was credited for his role in shaping the prime minister's media strategy. In April 2018, Keyes said that Yasser Murtaja, a Palestinian photographer killed by Israeli soldiers during demonstrations on the Gaza border, was a Hamas officer who used his drone to collect intelligence on Israeli positions. \\"I saw the intelligence myself,\\" Keyes said. \\"There is not a scintilla of doubt.\\" Prime Minister Netanyahu displays a piece of an armed Iranian drone that was shot down over Israel after infiltrating from Syria. The idea to display the drone piece came from David Keyes. In June 2018, Keyes was credited with producing a viral video in which Netanyahu offered to share Israeli water technology with Iran, which suffers from severe drought. \\"The Iranian people are the victims of a cruel and tyrannical regime that denies them vital water,\\" Netanyahu said. \\"Israel stands with the people of Iran and that is why I want to help save countless Iranian lives.\\" The video received five million views in five days. In addition, nearly 100,000 Iranians joined the Israeli government's Persian-language Telegram account in a 24-hour period. The video received wide media coverage in Iran, and many Iranian people reacted positively. The Iranian regime responded to the video by rejecting Netanyahu's offer of help. Keyes said that the main goal of publishing videos about Iran was to \\"[r]each out directly to the Iranian people and show them that Israel is their friend, not ‚Äì as the Iranian regime says ‚Äì their enemy.\\" Eli Lake, a foreign policy columnist for Bloomberg, credited Keyes' \\"revolutionary pedigree\\" from his time as a human rights activist for encouraging Netanyahu to speak directly to the Iranian people. In July 2018, Keyes crafted a video for Netanyahu that called on the world to help Iranians improve their lives by standing up to \\"a regime that oppresses them and denies them a life of dignity, prosperity, and respect.\\" Netanyahu told the story of an imaginary 15-year-old girl called Fatemeh whose daily life is full of hardships. The video was viewed more than 1.5 million times in ten days on Netanyahu's social media accounts. Fox News' Sean Hannity put the video on the top of his Twitter feed for more than 16 hours, where US President Donald Trump, along with Hannity's 3.6 million other followers, would likely see it. An Iranian student seeking political asylum in the United States said that Netanyahu's video messages to the Iranian people \\"resonated with many Iranians\\" and \\"made Israel popular in Iran.\\" In July 2018, Keyes was reported to be the leading candidate to replace Danny Danon as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. Keyes resigned from his position in December 2018 in order to pursue opportunities in the private sector.  Controversy  Before Keyes formally began his role as Netanyahu's spokesman, he underwent a lengthy vetting process for the job that brought him into the prime minister's inner circle. As part of the vetting process, Keyes passed a polygraph test during which he was asked questions about whether he was involved in any criminal or sexual offenses. In April 2016, one day after Keyes posted his first official tweet as Netanyahu's spokesperson, an anonymous complaint of sexual assault against Keyes was reported in Israeli media. The Jerusalem Post reported at the time that the complaint came from an anti-Israel activist who was denied entry to Israel in 2014. Keyes unequivocally denied the allegation. In September 2018, New York Senate candidate Julia Salazar, publicly accused Keyes of sexual assault.Netanyahu Spokesman Denies Sexual Assault Claim by N.Y. State Senate Candidate Julia Salazar, Haaretz, 12 September 2018 Salazar said she did so in order to preempt a planned story by The Daily Caller that she learned about beforehand which would have named her as the anonymous complainant from April 2016. Keyes denied her allegations, saying, \\"This false accusation is made by someone who has proven to be repeatedly dishonest about her own life. This is yet another example of her dishonesty.\\" Following these reports, a total of fourteen additional women subsequently came out with allegations of improper behavior; ten of them remained anonymous. One report said that in 2013, Keyes had been barred from entering The Wall Street Journal opinion section's offices without appointment due to complaints made by female employees. Another women, a North American immigrant to Israel, described an \\"aggressive, sexual advance\\", which she described in detail, made by Keyes weeks after he became Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesperson for the international media She added that Keyes had made it very clear exactly who he was, what he did at the time, referring to his position at the Prime Minister's office. Israel's Channel 10 reported that two female employees at the Washington, DC, think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies had also complained to their superiors about Keyes having \\"harassed\\" them in 2013. In response, Keyes said that \\"all of the accusations are deeply misleading and many of them are categorically false.\\" In September 2018, the Israeli Civil Service Commission looked into the complaints voiced about Keyes. The commission also investigated the role of Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer who had acknowledged that he was warned that Keyes was likely to be a threat to women working at the Prime Minister's office, but failed to alert the relevant authorities. Two months later, the commission closed its case. \\"There is no evidence or even a snippet of evidence to indicate a disciplinary offense or an act that constitutes sexual harassment by Keyes during the time he served as a civil servant,\\" the commission said in a letter. The commissioner, Prof. Hershkovitz explained that his reason for closing the enquiry was that the alleged offences had taken place before Mr Keyes was a government employee and that no complaint had criminal complaint had been registered with the police. On 12 December 2018, Keyes resigned from his post. Keyes released a statement after his resignation, saying, \\"I thank the Israel Civil Service Commission for closing its probe against me, stating 'There is no evidence or even a shred of evidence' of wrongdoing as an employee of the government.\\" Following Keyes' resignation, Netanyahu published a statement praising Keyes for his work. \\"I thank David Keyes for his great contribution to Israel's information effort,\\" Netanyahu said. \\"David pioneered groundbreaking videos which presented basic facts about Israel and enabled me to present Israel's policies to a global audience. Millions of people around the world viewed these videos with appreciation, and the messages aimed at the Iranian public were received with particular enthusiasm by many Iranian citizens. All this attests to David's talents and his contribution. I wish him much success on his future course.\\" References Living people University High School (Los Angeles) alumni University of California, Los Angeles alumni Tel Aviv University alumni American emigrants to Israel American democracy activists American human rights activists American Jews American public relations people Israeli human rights activists Israeli people of American- Jewish descent Year of birth missing (living people) Spokespersons Social media influencers ","title":"David Keyes"},{"id":"31549438","text":"Gilbert Jones was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1640.

The Lackawanna Cut-Off goes straight toward the upper right, while NJ Transit's Montclair-Boonton Line to Hackettstown, New Jersey, curves off to the left. Port Morris Junction is the railroad connection between NJ Transit's Montclair-Boonton Line and the Lackawanna Cut-Off. Opened in 1911 by the Lackawanna Railroad, it is in the Port Morris, New Jersey section of Roxbury Township, New Jersey, south of Lake Hopatcong. A temporary connection between NJ Transit's Montclair-Boonton Line, left, joins the Lackawanna Cut-Off at Port Morris Yard. Plans call for the junction to be returned to its historic location about 100 yards (100 m) to the east. When returned to service, it will be known as UN Junction after the former call letters of Port Morris Tower.  History  Soon after rail service began in the 1850s, the Lackawanna Railroad built a rail yard on the east side of the Morris Canal. The yard was initially used to shift coal from railcars to canal barges. By the turn of the 20th century, however, the canal was little used (it would be abandoned in 1924) and the yard was used primarily to store freight cars. As Lackawanna officials planned a route to shorten travel time from New York City to Buffalo, New York, the yard offered a compelling reason to begin the Cut-Off at Port Morris.The Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad in the Nineteenth Century (1 volume) and the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad in the Twentieth Century (2 volumes) by Thomas Townsend Taber III, Lycoming Printing Company, 1977, 1980, 1981. Port Morris Tower opened on December 23, 1911, and the first train to use the Cut-Off passed shortly after midnight the following morning. Port Morris Junction was part of the Lackawanna until October 17, 1960; the Erie Lackawanna Railroad until April 1, 1976; and Conrail until February 27, 1979, when the tower was closed.Lackawanna's Silent Sentinels ‚Äì Their Concrete Towers, by Bob Bahrs; Flags, Diamonds & Statues, Volume 21, No. 2 (April 2012). Conrail abandoned the Cut-Off in 1983 and pulled up the tracks at the junction in October 1984. During 1983, NJ Transit (NJT) had taken over the operation of commuter rail service in New Jersey, including through the old Port Morris Junction area. Later that decade, NJT began operating a rail yard there. Initially, the bridge department began operating out of Port Morris Yard. Then, in the 1990s, a commuter rail yard was built at Port Morris, allowing commuter trainsets to begin their weekday morning eastbound runs at Hackettstown, Mount Olive, Netcong or Lake Hopatcong from the yard rather than the yard in Dover, as had previously been the case. These trains then proceed to Denville where they travel to Hoboken via the Morristown Line or the Montclair-Boonton Line. Connections along the way allow travel to New York City. Westbound travel runs this pattern in reverse. (As of 2018, there was no weekend service west of Dover.) Port Morris Junction on April 9, 2011, looking west-northwest.

As of 2019, the junction is to be rebuilt, with tracks being relaid on the Cut-Off for commuter service to Andover, New Jersey, northwest of Port Morris Junction.

Co., 160 U.S. 668 (1896), was a case to prevent trolley operations on the Gettysburg Battlefield. The dispute began in August 1891 when the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association's board approved attorney Samuel Swope's motion to deny trolley right-of-way along GBMA roads. (cited by Unrau p. 64) NOTE: In 1894 during the trolley suit, Swope became a judge. Despite the 1896 US Supreme Court ruling that the railway could be seized for historic preservation, as well as earlier legislative efforts to appropriate federal acquisition funds, create a War Department commission, and form the Gettysburg National Military Park; the trolley continued operations until obsolete in 1916. Background Near the end of the 19th century, tourists to the 1863 Gettysburg Battlefield typically arrived at the borough by train and paid fees for horse-drawn jitney taxis to travel over the battlefield on primitive wagon roads of the private Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association. The GBMA owned less than of the battlefield's much larger area, and nearly all military engagement areas were privately owned and had twelve small GBMA-owned monument plots of . Some owners rented land for camping, sold souvenirs/refreshments, and by 1894 required top dollar prices for real estate purchases. Similarly, the original battlefield roads had fallen into disrepair after the GBMA funds had become nearly exhausted by late 1882. Despite the preceding 1884 Round Top Branch steamtrain railroad that operated across the field of Pickett's Charge and Hancock Avenue to Round Top Station, an 1892 meeting next-door at the Round Top School formed an opposition committee of Cumberland Township voters (William H. Tipton was the only attendee favoring the trolley, also attended (1892 Gettysburg Compiler, 1942 Out of the Past articles) and the township subsequently granted road right-of-way.) =Gettysburg Park Commission= The Gettysburg Park Commission (GPC) was established by the United States Department of War on March 3, 1893, (NPS webpage for monument MN508) for \\"ascertaining the extent of...the trolley\\" (trolley track construction began April 1893). The Appropriations Act of 1893 on March 3 had funded $25,000, a June 9 supplemental act directed \\"acquisition and designation by tablets of the lines of battle\\", and the battlefield survey \\"was at once commenced\\" after topographer Emmor Cope was selected at the first commission meeting on July 1. Federal acquisition of land that would become the 1895 Gettysburg National Military Park began on June 2, 1893, with a tract of from John H. Miller & wife. By July 1893, GPC commissioner John B. Bachelder reported to the Secretary of War (local article, New York Times article) about battlefield railbed construction (notably planned along the west of The Angle's historic stone wall), and acting secretary Lewis A. Grant referred the complaint to the acting Judge Advocate General. Trolley right-of-way over the private 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry Monument tract at The Angle was denied by June 13, 1893; and the route was changed to instead use the Emmitsburg Road. During the July 2‚Äì3, 1893, New York Monuments Commission visit for dedicating the 44th New York monument with observation deck on Little Round Top, two altercations against photographer Tipton resulted in a writ by local judge McClean against General Daniel Sickles, General Daniel Butterfield, and two civil war colonels. The writ was followed by an August 2, 1893, trolley complaint to the commonwealth by the GBMA, Edward McPherson, and thirty-nine other citizens; and a counter petition by 268 Gettysburg and 58 Cumberland township citizens favoring the trolley. The PA Attorney General denied action after the subsequent hearing: \\"the right of owners of private property‚Äîwhatever public interest may attach to it‚Äîto dispose of it to passenger railway corporations, cannot be disputed. ...the line itself...has been chosen with a view of affording tourists the best possible means of visiting and viewing this great battlefield and doing the least possible injury to its natural conditions\\". (published in Gettysburg Times, August 15) Despite a lack of funds that halted construction in August 1893, the railway began operations as early as September 1893 and was completed to Tipton Park and Round Top Park in 1894. Also despite the lawsuit, a new trolley powerhouse was built to replace the original in the borough that had burnt down by January 22, 1895, and by October 1895 total trackage was . The trolley system had been sold to a new owner in the month prior to passage of the February 11, 1895, \\"Sickles Gettysburg Park Bill\\" that authorized federal land acquisition to form the Gettysburg National Military Park. Also during the federal suit, the railway company became insolvent and Judge Dallas had placed it into receivership by September 1895. Federal case US v. Gett. Elec. Ry. Co. began with the GBMA's April 7, 1894, bill in equity to block trolley use of a particular railway section over Hancock Avenue as recommended by the 72nd PA Infantry committee in 1893: \\"set aside spots right in the route of the trolley\\". Likewise, the US District Attorneyhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7VRAAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=g_8FAAAAIBAJ&dq;=switch%20carlisle- street%20gettysburg&pg;=3571%2C3432350 petitioned for condemnation of a strip of of land on May 3, 1894; and the trolley company responded with a bill in equity to stop the US eminent domain acquisition . (Attorneys Hart, Hebner, & David Wills) The US motion to stop construction was dismissed by Judge Dallas of the United States Circuit Court: \\"powers of congress are distinctly enumerated in the constitution, and in that enumeration none is included to which the uses for which it is proposed to condemn this land can be related, without, in my opinion, enlarging the constitutional grant by grafting upon its express terms a construction so lax and comprehensive as to be subversive of its limited character.\\" Judge Dallas swore in the jury of Adams County residents on June 29, 1894; and the local hearing in front of the jury was September 11‚Äì15 after which \\"they adjourned for argument in Philadelphia.\\" On November 3, 1894, the jury identified $30,000 \\"as the measure of damage that would be done the Trolley by the proposed change\\".The Star and Sentinel - Google News Archive Search Both parties appealed the jury amount as too high/low (the company on November 12, 1894), \\"On \\"July 8, 1894, the Attorney-General of the United States directed proceedings to be commenced against the electric railway at Gettysburg\\". and the company agreed on November 13 to move tracks from the vicinity of Devil's Den and Tipton Station if the expense would be paid (refused ). The US attorney Ellery P. Ingham filed an additional petition for condemning a second tract in January 1895, which along with his June 7 petition were denied by the Philadelphia federal court. (dissenting opinion, PA Judge Butler) The 1896 reversal by the Supreme Court of the United States ruled historic preservation \\"seems\\" to be \\"a public use\\". Aftermath \\"The impression in the town\\" was the Secretary of War would not pay the $30,000 nor \\"take further steps\\" to acquire the railway, and the trolley operated even after the Commission‚Äîfollowing a May 7 federal hearing‚Äîacquired 2 William H. Tipton tracts of on December 31, 1901. In 1908, Borough of Gettysburg vs. Gettysburg Transit Co. required trolley payment of \\"car tax\\" assessed after the company failed to perform agreed maintenance of borough streets [cited by Google News Archive (Gettysburg Compiler)] (reversed August 1908). In 1909, C. Taylor Leland vs. The Gettysburg Transit Company ordered a trustee's auction in the foreclosure of the 1898 mortgage (purchased in September), and an injury lawsuit was initiated for trolley cars colliding on August 15 near Devil's Den. Trolley operations ended in November 1916 when the railway had become obsolete with disrepair and increased use of battlefield avenues that had been improved with War Department Telford piking. =First Army Appropriations Act of 1917= Congressional funding for the seizure failed in an attempted amendment on February 26, 1917.Congressional Record containing the Proceedings and Debates of the Second Session of the Sixty-Fourth Congress of The United States of America, Volume LIV, Part 5; From February 25, 1917, to March 4, 1917; page 4334 After annual trolley operations on the battlefield hadn't commenced in the spring, the First Army Appropriations Act of 1917 funded $30,000 on May 9 for the \\"practically abandoned property\\". Instead of paying damages to the trolley company, the funds paid for removing the tracks and acquiring the associated landowners' tracts (most had been deeded to the US years earlier). Remnants of the trolley were entered-documented in 2004 as historic contributing structures of the Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District. Similar eminent domain acquisitions include the 1904 United States v. Five Tracts of land that seized land near Reynolds Grove and, on September 18, 1905, Cunningham Grove. The 1974 Gettysburg National Tower, which was on private land not used for military engagements and which had been granted use of federal land, was seized in 2000 and demolished due to its appearance.

There are eyewitnesses who have noted that the incident happened in a fit of rage but are clueless about what actually transpired before Ramachandran used his weapon and even Ramachandran has pleaded guilty without being ready to disclose anything else.

This cylinder is coated with a special mixture. Only 25 instruments were ever built by Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann, the son of Johann David Buschmann, the inventor of this instrument. Johann David Buschmann was first a passementier, then he started repairing key instruments. By 1817 the instrument spanned a range of 5 1/2 octaves. * 1821 one instrument came into London.The Quarterly journal, Band 11, Royal Institution of Great Britain - 1821 Online * 1821 David Buschmann sold a licence for building terpodions to the instrument builder David Loescham and the cheesemonger James Allwright.The London journal of arts and sciences, Band 6, 14.

J√§nner 1841, Page 350, Online Examples of these instruments can be seen in museums all over Europe, including museums in Copenhagen, Leipzig, Vienna, London, Brussels, Stockholm, Jevisovice and Frankfurt/Oder. Technical explanation A Terpodion being played Terpodion Innenansicht, Inv.-Nr.: V/J 417, St√§dtische Museen Junge Kunst und Viadrina, 15230 Frankfurt (Oder) Terpodion Patentzeichnung There is a certain relationship with the glass harmonica and the clavic cylinder. The glass harmonica produces the sound by friction from touching the rotating bells with wet fingers. With the terpodion, operating the keyboard pushes a wooden or metal arm against a rotating coated cylinder of wood or other material, producing sounds by friction. For the lower notes the arms are mainly made of wood and for the higher notes they are made of metal. The arms are adjustable so the pitch of each note can be adjusted within the tuning process. The terpodion rarely requires tuning. The rotating cylinder is made from box wood (Buxus sempervirens), but the patent states it could be any material. The most important aspect of the cylinder is the coating. The exact mixture can be seen in the patent writing. (2 parts ethanol, 1 part mastic, 1 part sandarac, 1/16 part campher). The vibrating parts are pushed by the key mechanism toward the rotating cylinder so a sort of hammer that is covered by soft rough leather, which is coated with same mixture as the cylinder. The volume of the sound is dependent on the amount of pressure applied to the keys. The lower register requires more pressure for the same amount of volume as the higher register. The instrument didn't stay playable for long and had to be serviced from time to time. This may be one of the reasons why the Buschmanns did look for other ways of producing the sound, and replaced the friction sound production by free reeds on other instruments. The instrument had piano keys, and a similar look as the later reed organs. On the other hand, there were also instruments built that had both a keyboard for the friction sound and another one for the free reed sound. Buschmann was one of the first to use vacuum type reeds in his physharmonicas. =The Melodion of Dietz= The melodion was very much like the terpodion. The one invented in 1806 by Dietz in Emmerich was presented to the public by Petzhold (or Betzold) in many places in Europe. There was only one main difference; all the sound came from vibrating metal structures. > \\"Der Ton wird durch die Reibung metallener St√§be [...] mittelst dem mit > einem elastischen K√∂rper umringten, sich umdrehenden Cylinders > hervorgebracht, welcher [...] mit den F√ºssen des Spielers in Bewegung > gehalten wird, [...]\\" Vom Melodion wurden bei weitem mehr Instrumente gebaut > als vom Terpodeon. \\"Seine Fabrik ist bereits in solchem Flor[irenden > Zustand], dass best√§ndig gegen dreyssig [(30)] Instrumente in Arbeit sind. > Der meiste Absatz schr√§nkt sich jetzt nur noch auf das benachbarte Holland > und Westphalen ein, wo der Erfinder auf einer kleinen Reise selbst dieses > Instrument [vorf√ºhrte] [...].\\"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Band 8, Seite > 715 - 718, Online Befeuchtet wurde im Gegensatz zum Clavicylinder dabei > nichts. \\"- Und ohne Gebrauch des Wassers hervorgebracht; der innere [...] > Mechanismus, hat wol die meiste Aehnlichkeit mit dem, des Chladnischen > Klavieylinders, ist aber weniger zusammengesetzt und weit vollkommener > ausgef√ºhrt.\\" Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Band 8, Page 526, 527, Online The tuning or retuning to up to a quarter note could be adjusted by screws for each note individually. Readjusting did not have to take place at all if one was happy with the tuning reverence note. The metal structures kept better to the pitch than wooden parts. Dietz also invented the chalybssonnans. This used friction on glass or metal rods by rubbing the rods along their length. The sound was much like the one produced by the glass harmonicas. Newsletter articles (All following quotes are adjusted to modern German, please feel free to translate) Die Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung, Nr. 30 vom 25. April 1810 berichtet auf Seite 469 und 470 folgendes: ¬´Bei der Gelegenheit einige Gedanken √ºber den Clavicylinder. Runde oder auch viereckige Glasscheiben geben bekanntlich, wenn sie am Rande an einem Punkt befestigt sind, [...] einen Ton ab, wenn sie von einem andern glatten Glask√∂rper auf der hohen, glatt geschliffenen Kante gerieben werden. ‚Äî Der Befestigungspunkt sowohl als auch der Ber√ºhrungspunkt beim Reiben muss sorgf√§ltig gesucht werden. ‚Äî Ebenso muss die Tongr√∂√üe der Glasscheiben untersucht werden. ‚Äî K√∂nnen an eine Tastatur solche Glasscheiben mit bestimmter Tongr√∂√üe am hinterm Ende befestigt werden, so wird ein gemeinschaftlicher Zylinder, welcher die Glasscheiben reibt, sobald durch den Druck der Tasten dieselben an den Zylinder treffen, den jeder Glasscheibe eigent√ºmlichen Ton entlocken. Es versteht sich, dass jede Taste am vorderen Ende so viel Gegengewicht braucht, als die Glasscheibe am hinterm Ende hat. Ein neu erfundenes Tasteninstrument, wird Uranion genannt. Dieses Instrument hat in der Gestalt und Spielart viel √Ñhnlichkeit mit dem Melodion. Es ist 4 Fu√ü lang, 2 Fu√ü breit, und 1 Fu√ü hoch; es hat daher ein kompaktes und ein gef√§lliges √Ñu√üeres. Der Umfang der T√∂ne ist 5 1/2 Oktaven; n√§mlich vom Contra-F bis zum vier-gestrichenen c. Der Zylinder in demselben ist mit Tuch umzogen und wird mittels eines Fu√ütritts und Rades in Bewegung gesetzt. Da der Mechanismus dieses Instruments √§u√üerst einfach ist, und die Hauptsache bei der Herzvorbringung des Tons eine Fraktion an Holz, und nicht an Metall oder Glas ist so ist dasselbe nicht nur leichter, als ein gew√∂hnliches Fortepiano, sondern es kann auch in der Folge gewiss um einen g√ºnstigen Preis angeschafft werden. Als ich das Melodion, von Petzold gespielt, h√∂rte, fand ich, dass die Basst√∂ne verh√§ltnism√§√üig [...] schwach waren, welchen Fehler das Uranion keineswegs hat; auch sind bei diesem die hohen mittleren und tiefen T√∂ne nicht so verschiedenartig als bei jenem, und lassen alle Abstufungen vom leisesten Piano bis zu betr√§chtlichem Forte zu. Sein Ton ist wahrhaft himmlisch und wirkt stark auf das Herz. Der Erfinder hei√üt Buschmann, und wohnt in dem 1 Meile von Gotha gelegenen Bergst√§dtchen Friedrichroda. Er ist ein Posamentirer von Profession und versuchte es vor mehreren Jahren, da er an dergleichen Besch√§ftigungen Vergn√ºgen fand, alte Klaviere und andere Tasten - Instrumente zu reparieren; lernte dabei ihren Innern Bau immer genauer kennen; baute bald selbst einige solche Instrumente, und machte sich endlich auch an die Ausf√ºhrung dieses so vortrefflichen Instrumentes, dem er auf Anraten den Nahmen Uranion gegeben hat. Er hat jetzt eine Reise damit angetreten und sich zuerst in Schmalkalden h√∂ren lassen, wo mehrere Kenner, und vorz√ºglich [auch] Pierling, dem Instrumente ihren Beifall schenkten.¬ªDie Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Nr. 30 vom 25.

The endocardial heart tubes derive from the visceral mesoderm and initially are formed by a confluence of angioblastic blood vessels on either side of the embryonic midline. The endocardial tubes have an intimate proximity to the foregut or pharyngeal endoderm.

According to jail officials, Chowdhury asked for mercy in a petition to the President of Bangladesh, but his appeal was rejected.  Execution  On 22 November 2015, at 12:45 in the morning, Chowdhury was executed by hanging at Dhaka Central Jail. Another convict, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, was also executed around the same time.

Their children include Farzin, Hummam (b. 1983) and Fazlul. In August 2016, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International alleged that Hummam was arrested on 4 August 2016, and disappeared. Amnesty says multiple credible sources place him at Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) headquarters in Dhaka on 12 August, but authorities have denied having him in custody. Hummam returned home in March 2017. Chowdhury's brother, Giasuddin Quader Chowdhury, was a member of parliament from Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Other two brothers were Saifuddin and Jamaluddin.

He is married with two daughters and lives in San Francisco. Research Lustig's research examines links between excess consumption of fructose‚Äîa component of sucrose (table sugar), honey, fruit and some vegetables‚Äîand the development of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome can include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity and the phenomenon \\"TOFI\\" (\\"thin-outside-fat-inside\\"). Lustig argues that fructose can be consumed safely within whole fruits and vegetables because of the role played by the accompanying dietary fiber. But he maintains that the liver is damaged by the fructose in table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup that are added to food and beverages (particularly convenience food and soft drinks), and by the fructose in fruit juice and vegetable juice. His position is that sugars are not simply empty calories; he rejects the idea that \\"a calorie is a calorie.\\"Gary Taube, \\"Is Sugar Toxic?\\", The New York Times, 13 April 2011. Lustig was a co-author in 2009 of the American Heart Association's guideline on sugar intake, which recommended that women consume no more than 100 calories daily from added sugars and men no more than 150. That year, a 90-minute lecture by Lustig, \\"Sugar: The Bitter Truth,\\" recorded in May 2009 for University of California Television, became popular on YouTube. By February 2017, the video had been viewed almost seven million times.Ian Leslie, \\"The sugar conspiracy\\", The Guardian, 7 April 2016.

Criticism Lustig's statements on fructose metabolism and weight gain were disputed in a systematic review of clinical research on obesity and metabolic syndrome. The review and its authors were subsequently criticized because they have been funded by the sugar and soft drink industries; one author, John Sievenpiper, has also been retained as an expert witness by the Corn Refiners Association.

The RCSP was drawn from Alabama businesses, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations. It announced entry into the competition on 7 September 2010, and departed from the competition after the team was acquired by Moon Express in December 2012. History In December 2012, the Rocket City Space Pioneers team was acquired by one of the other Google Lunar X-Prize teams, Moon Express, from Dynetics for an undisclosed sum. The new agreement makes Tim Pickens, the former lead of the RCSP team, the Chief Propulsion Engineer for MoonEx. Mission The Rocket City Space Pioneers' stated primary mission was to capture the GLXP $20 million Grand Prize, as well as the $4 million Apollo Heritage Bonus Prize. The RCSP was developing a low-cost lunar lander/rover system for conducting commercial and scientific missions on the Moon. This system was intended to be capable of making a soft landing on the Moon and deploying a robotic rover. It was to be launched from the Earth by a medium-lift launch vehicle as part of a larger payload, then taken to a lunar orbit by a ‚Äútug‚Äù rocket-propulsion unit, and finally dropped to the Moon's surface. =Flight Sequence= A Falcon 9 two-stage rocket, built by SpaceX, was notionally planned to be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to place several metric tons of payload into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). This RCSP payload was planned to consist of a primary payload, multiple rideshare payloads, and a tug (an ESPA ring with an added propulsion module). Once in Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit, the primary payload was to be deployed, along with three secondary payloads. The tug, containing the remaining three payloads, was to have separated from the Falcon 9 second stage and perform a Trans Lunar Injection burn. As the tug neared the Moon, it was planned to make a final braking burn, inserting it with its payloads in a Low Lunar Orbit (LLO) Once in LLO, the tug was to have deployed the remaining three payloads, including the RCSP lander. The lander/rover will have its own small retrorocket, and, after being jettisoned from the tug, was projected to conduct a braking maneuver to land softly on the lunar surface. Once on the surface, the lander, would deploy a small rover for the required exploration. =Surface Exploration= As initially planned by the RCSP team, the rover was to have been capable of driving at least when it reached the lunar surface; this is twice the required GXLP roving distance. The rover was projected to be approximately in size and less than in mass. The early design included a plan to leave the rover tethered to the lander, with all external control and communications through this multi-circuit tether. The rover was to have carried two or more high-definition video cameras and possibly other sensors. The lander was to contain the system for communicating with the control center on the Earth, possibly being relayed through the orbiting tug. The specific landing site and exploration traverse was never announced. Team members The RCSP is based in and named after Huntsville, Alabama (widely known as \\"The Rocket City\\"). Huntsville has been a leader in rocket development and space exploration since the arrival of Wernher von Braun and his team in 1950.Ward, Bob; Dr. Space: The Life of Wernher von Braun, Naval Institute Press, 2005 Members of the RSCP come from businesses, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations having operations in the Huntsville community.

Some equipment came from the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Armored Division, whose equipment was acquired by a unit of the Polish Military Organization. Several armored trains fought supporting the Polish forces in the Greater Poland uprising (1918‚Äì9) and the Polish-Ukrainian War (1918‚Äì19). The armored trains saw major action in the Polish-Soviet War (1919‚Äì21). Approximately 50 armored trains participated in that conflict on the Polish side; on average, about twenty were in active service at any given time. Sixteen armored trains supported the Polish insurgents during the Third Silesian Uprising. Artillery wagon, used in Polish armored trains \\"≈ömia≈Çy\\" and \\"Pi≈Çsudczyk\\" (before 1939) In 1921 the armored trains forces were reorganized into 6 divisions, each composed of two trains, attached to train engineers regiments (1st in Krak√≥w, 2nd in Jab≈Çonna (Legionowo) and 3rd in Pozna≈Ñ). In 1924 the 3rd Regiment was disbanded, and the remaining armored train divisions were transformed into the Armored Trains Training Division in Jab≈Çonna (Legionowo). The Training Division, in 1925 renamed to Educational Division, in 1927 was reorganized into the 1st Armored Train Division. In 1928 the 2nd Armored Train Division was formed in Niepo≈Çomice. Each division had 6 trains. In 1929, the Polish Engineering Force was reorganized, with the 1st and 2nd Train Engineer Regiments being transformed into Train Bridges Battalions. In 1931 the modernization of armored trains was finished with similar armament installed on most units. The trains were classified as either \\"light\\" or \\"heavy\\". \\"Light\\" trains had two artillery and one infantry wagons, and World War I-era Austro-Hungarian or Russian weapons (two to four 75mm guns, eight to sixteen heavy machine guns, and two anti-aircraft heavy machine guns). \\"Heavy\\" trains had a better engine (Ti3), 100mm guns in addition to the 75mm pieces and gun turrets for the heavy machine guns. The trains were also accompanied by several light tanks (FT-17s or tankettes). Each train had its own supply train that contained living quarters, kitchen, workshop, a compartment for the wounded personnel, and supplies. Together, a train (combat and supply) had a crew of 8 officers, 59 warrant officers and 124 regular infantrymen. Around the mid-1930s, revisions to Poland's tactical and strategic doctrines meant that armored trains, previously considered a high-quality force, begun to be seen as increasingly obsolete on the battlefield.  1939‚Äì1945 (WWII)  Combat operations of Polish armored trains in the Polish September Campaign (1939) The ten trains of the 1st and 2nd Armored Trains Divisions were mobilized in late August to early September, and received numbers 11‚Äì5 (1st Division) and 51‚Äì5 (2nd Division). With the exceptions of trains 14 and 15 which finished forming on 3 September and were assigned to the reserves of the High Command, all other trains finished forming before the start of hostilities on 1 September. The 2nd Division also fielded a lightly armed training armored train, although it was not supposed to be used in the frontline combat. The command of the Land Coastal Defence decided to field improvised trains to bolster its defenses. The first was ready before the war began, two others were finished during the hostilities. They used weapons from the Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy and the unfinished ORP Orkan and Huragan destroyers. The first train was destroyed after four days of fighting on 4 September, the second, less than a day after it entered service (it entered service on 3 September and was destroyed on the night of 3 to 4 September). The last train, \\"Smok Kaszybski\\" (Kashubian Dragon) entered combat on 7 September, and was operational till 12 September. On 20 September, during the siege of Warsaw, two improvised armored trains were formed (Nr. 1 and Nr. 2). Not much is known about their combat operations; the first train entered service on 22 September, and the second a day later.

During the Polish September Campaign, Polish armored trains took part in roughly 90 clashes with the German units. They played a significant role in several encounters, most notably, no 53 made an important contribution to the Polish victory in the Battle of Mokra, and no 54 was used very successfully in the defense of Silesia. Armored trains were responsible for destroying or damaging several dozens of armored vehicles, including tanks, shot down or damaged three airplanes, and inflicted numerous infantry casualties. Only two trains (no 11 and 55) were destroyed in direct combat by the German land forces, and only no 13 was destroyed by the German air force. Remaining trains were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews when they ran out of munitions and could no longer retreat. The successful role of the armored trains, considered obsolete by both Polish and German strategists, caused the revision of that judgment by both sides. About a dozen Polish armoured trains in Britain were formed by the Polish Armed Forces in the West, and were assigned to patrol the British railways in 1940. They saw no combat, and were disbanded by July 1943.  1945‚Äì1952  After the war, in the Republic of Poland, Railroad Guards (Stra≈º Ochrony Kolei) used four armored trains from 1945 to 1950. In 1947, a Train Artillery Division was formed, and disbanded in 1952.

Though she never earned a salary of more than $4,000 per year, she amassed a fortune of $22 million through frugal living and investing. Career Anne Scheiber was an unknown, reclusive and extremely frugal New York woman who worked as an auditor for the United States Internal Revenue Service, retiring from the IRS in 1944. She never earned a salary of more than $4,000 per year, and although she was an exemplary worker, she never received a promotion. This likely reflected discrimination towards women in the workforce in general during that period, as well as attitudes of antisemitism that were endemic in elite American institutions in the mid-20th century, including the U.S. government. Despite her experiences with discrimination, Scheiber's life became noteworthy for her accomplishment as an extremely skillful investor during her 50 years of retirement, and ultimately as a surprise philanthropist in support of women's education. Scheiber was born in Brooklyn, New York, and lived to the age of 101. She had nine siblings, but apparently had few close family members or friends and never married. Her father died when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, and thus began working in her teen years to earn money. Despite the difficulties of her early years, Scheiber managed to graduate both from college and law school, but chose to work as an auditor with the IRS. Her only known acquaintances were Ben Clark, her attorney, and William Fay, her broker at Merrill Lynch. In her early adult years, Scheiber had a series of negative experiences with financial brokers in the 1930s, and eventually retired from her job as an auditor at the IRS in the mid-1940s, with only $5,000 saved up and a $3,100 annual pension. She then spent the next 50 years studying the markets and accumulating wealth while living in her frugal New York apartment. By making a series of wise financial investments, share purchases, and savings, Scheiber managed to accumulate a net worth of $22 million by the end of her life. Despite her extensive wealth, she had a reputation for frugality and eccentricity, including one incident in which she took food from a meeting of shareholders and consumed it over the next three days. At the end of her life, she lived in the same apartment and wore the same clothing that she did in 1944. After her death in 1995 at the age of 101, she donated her fortune to establishing scholarships for women at Yeshiva University's Stern College for Women, and the Albert Einstein School of Medicine, with the intention of enabling younger women to overcome the discrimination that she herself had endured during her working years. Her gift shocked and surprised many, not only for its size but that its source came from a donor who was unknown and lived in virtual obscurity. Scheiber's investment strategy developed over her lifetime has become known in recent years as a premier example of the \\"buy and hold\\" philosophy of investing in businesses. She became an astute student of the markets, likely benefiting from her prior work as a tax auditor, applied and exemplified a very tax-efficient strategy of investing in high quality companies for long term growth, and selling few of her investments during her lifetime, thus avoiding significant tax payments on capital gains. Upon bequeathal of her entire fortune to Yeshiva University at the time of her death, she ensured that little taxes were ever paid to her former employer, other than small payments on dividends and on her modest pension. With this feat she can be considered one of the great equity investors of the 20th century, as well as a noteworthy philanthropist in supporting educational opportunities for women. Her executor, Benjamin Clark, said that the claims about Scheiber's investing skill have been exaggerated. Her 1936 tax return showed dividend income of $900, which would indicate she had a substantial portfolio several years before her retirement. If her stocks earned an average dividend yield for 1936, her portfolio would have been about $21,000. Compounding $21,000 for almost 60 years and winding up with $22 million indicates a return slightly higher than the S&P500.; References External links * How Anne Schieber Amassed Her Fortune * The Most Successful Dividend Investors of all times 1893 births 1995 deaths 20th-century American businesspeople American philanthropists 20th-century philanthropists ","title":"Anne Scheiber"},{"id":"31550084","text":"Petr√≥polis is a neighbourhood in the city of Porto Alegre, the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil.

Van Amburgh (1808‚Äì1865) was an American animal trainer who developed the first trained wild animal act in modern times.Culhane, John. The American Circus, Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 20 By introducing jungle acts into the circus, Van Amburgh paved the way for combining menageries with circuses. After that, menageries began using equestrian and clown performances in circus rings. Gradually the distinction between circus and menagerie faded.Culhane, John. The American Circus, Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 17 From the humble beginning of cage-cleaner in the Zoological Institute of New York, Van Amburgh quickly gained notoriety for his acts of daring, for example placing his bare arm and even head inside the jaws of a wild cat.History Magazine, \\"Step Right Up,\\" October/November 2001 issue http://www.history- magazine.com/circuses.html. Also known for his domineering attitude toward his animals, he earned the title \\"The Lion King.\\" Despite the disapproval of some for his brutal treatment of animals, Van Amburgh remained very popular and successful, beginning his own menagerie which he took to Europe. He died a wealthy man, and his name continued to be used in the circus world for more than a century after.Culhane, John. The American Circus, Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 149 Early life and beginning of career Isaac A. Van Amburgh (a name adopted by his American Indian grandfather) was born on May 26, 1808 in Fishkill, New York. Van Amburgh's early life, though atypical, proved to be of great training for his later adventures as \\"the Lion King.\\" Van Amburgh's father died when he was still an infant, leaving him and his mother with very little. The night before Amburgh was born, his mom had a strange dream. According to Richard Horne in The Life of Van Amburgh, the Brute-Tamer: With Anecdotes of His Extraordinary Pupils, she dreamt that she walked into an old barn with rows of cooking kettles lined up. As she opened the kettles one by one, she found different parts of a lion's body cooking in the kettle. She then proceeded to devour the lion part by part and put the lion's whole head in her mouth. She woke up extremely disturbed, having no idea what this dream meant for her son's future. Horne goes on to describe how Isaac's mom was constantly worried about him while he was growing up. Legend dictates that while reading the Bible, young Isaac came upon the tale of Daniel in the lion's den, and, from then on, was determined to be a lion tamer.Johnson, William M., The Rose-Tinted Menagerie (http://www.iridescent- publishing.com/rtm/ch1p3.htm). Van Amburgh never showed the same interests in material objects or even games as the other children. Rather, he spent his time surrounded by roaches, mice, and rats, feeding them pieces of his dinner to attract and even train them. He soon became a sort of animal authority to call when the local wildlife disrupted neighborhood homes and farms. Van Amburgh would investigate reports of destroyed or stolen crops and livestock and seek out the animal responsible. Upon finding the offender, he would beat the creature into submission, effectively preventing it from causing additional problems. He found his start in the Zoological Institute of New York. =Zoological Institute of New York= At nineteen, Isaac left his home in Peekskill, New York to look for a job in neighboring North Salem. There he found a job as a cage cleaner in the Zoological Institute of New York. Despite its lofty-sounding name, the Zoological Institute was not a zoo at all, but rather a tiny traveling menagerie. In a period of time when amusement was regarded with suspicion, it was from its name that this show got its value.Culhane, John. The American Circus, Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 16 Although he started out as a \\"cage boy,\\" Isaac showed an aptitude for training the wild animals whose cages he cleaned. One of the owners of the Zoological Institute, Titus, was a dealer in wild animals. So he appreciated the novelty of trained wild animals, recognizing that \\"novelty plus publicity meant money.\\" June, Titus, and Angevine distributed posters by the thousands. They put Isaac in costume ‚Äì a Roman toga, in reference to the gladiators of ancient Rome's Circus Maximus. In the winter, Van Amburgh trained his wild animals in the barns of New York's upper Westchester and the lower Putnam counties. The next year, 1821, the Van Amburgh Menagerie hit New York City. The Lion King Isaac van Amburgh (1808‚Äì1865) by T. C. Wilson 1838 in National Portrait Gallery, London. In 1833, at age twenty-two, Isaac A. Van Amburgh entered a cage of wild cats at the Zoological Institute. In the cage were a lion, a lioness, leopard, leopardess, black-maned Cape lion, and a panther.#\\"Circus in America\\" ¬© to Lavahn G.

The Lion halted and stood transfixed. The Tiger crouched. The Panther with a suppressed growl of rage sprang back, while the Leopard receded gradually from its master. The spectators were overwhelmed with wonder .... Then came the most effective tableaux of all. Van Amburgh with his strong will bade them come to him while he reclined in the back of the cage ‚Äì the proud King of animal creation.\\"Ferguson, O. J. Biographical Sketch of I. A. Van Amburgh. Booth & Co., 1865. Van Amburgh did more than just enter the cage. Nathaniel Hawthorne described a menagerie he saw on September 4, 1828, near North Adams, Massachusetts: \\"A man put his arm and head into the lion's mouth, ‚Äì all the spectators looking on so attentively that a breath could not be heard. That was impressive, ‚Äì its effect on a thousand persons, ‚Äì more than the thing itself.\\"Hawthorne, Nathaniel. Passages from the American Note-Books of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1898. Entry for September 4, 1838. As Van Amburgh was one of the few performers of the time to perform this way, it was probably Van Amburgh that Hawthorne saw.Culhane, John. The American Circus, Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 21. In fact, Van Amburgh is usually credited with being the first man ever to put his head into the mouth of a lion. On July 7, 1838, the New York Mirror also described how Van Amburgh's \\"fearless acts of placing his bare arm moist with blood, in the lion's mouth and thrusting his head into the distended jaws of the tiger\\" were watched with keen interest. =Van Amburgh's Menagerie= Van Amburgh, made an instant hero, discovered he now had the freedom to make his own decisions. By entering lions' dens in and out of the country, he began earning real money. Featured in the \\"Flatfoot shows,\\" he was able to earn up to four hundred dollars per week. By age twenty-three, he had his own travelling menagerie, and by the mid-1840s his was the largest traveling show in England. In 1861, it was one of America's eleven big traveling shows.Van Amburgh had a structure to his shows that allowed his act to be easily transportable and sustainable, while also providing audience members with knowledge of what they were purchasing tickets to see. A typical show for Isaac Van Amburgh featured several animals including tigers, leopards, lambs, and lions. He showcased animals of all shapes and sizes to promote variety as well as showcase how he could train animals who normally do not get along well together in the same space. He performed his shows in cages that were transportable so that he could move to various venues easily. These venues were popular including the famous Drury Lane Theatre, in which Queen Victoria watched him perform. During his act, he performed several tricks that were known among his audiences. He would ride on the back of a lion, lay the lion and the lamb side by side to show how well tamed they were, and most impressively, stuck his own head inside the mouth of the lion to show how docile he had rendered the animal.Culhane, John, 1990 The American Circus, pg. 66. Even after the 1868 fire that killed Van Amburgh's animals and destroyed other circus artifacts, the potent name of Van Amburgh continued to be used by circuses until 1922.Culhane, John, 1990 The American Circus, pg. 97.Culhane, John, 1990 The American Circus, pg. 13. =London and Queen Victoria= Isaac van Amburgh with his Animals by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer In the late 1830s, Van Amburgh took his act to England and Europe for several years.Thayer, Stuart. American Circus Anthology, Essays of the Early Years, arranged and edited by William L. Slout. Copyright ¬© 2005 by Stuart Thayer and William L. Slout. He made his debut in London at Astley's on August 27, 1838, and his said to have made ¬£300 per week there.Culhane, John, 1990 The American Circus, pg. 24. While in England, Van Amburgh performed for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1844.Culhane, John, 1990 The American Circus, pg. 55. The former took special interest in him. In fact, the Queen commissioned artist Edwin Landseer to paint a portrait of Van Amburgh and his cats. Upon its completion, the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy, an impressive honor for the time. In 1839, Queen Victoria traveled six times in as many months solely to watch Van Amburgh perform at Drury Lane.Culhane, John, 1990 The American Circus, pg. 39. She even remained after one evening's performance in order to watch his feeding the cats. Even before his 1838 European debut, Van Amburgh was one of America's most celebrated characters. But after such special royal favor, Van Amburgh \\"became a figure that even the American upper crust could admit to appreciating.\\" He was the first major American wild animal trainer to achieve such an international celebrity status. Criticisms Van Amburgh in the Wild Cat Cage Circuses were regularly under attack in the press and at the pulpit as \\"traveling death\\" and \\"moral ruin.\\" Culhane, John, 1990 The American Circus, pg. 31. But predecessors of Van Amburgh were less inhumane.Band Wagon, \\"The Keeper Will Enter the Cage: Early American Wild Animal Trainers,\\" November‚ÄìDecember 1982. Despite his great success and popularity, Van Amburgh regularly faced criticism for the cruelty he showed to his animals. Van Amburgh reportedly beat his animals with a crowbar. In costume, whether in loose-fitting jungle clothing or ancient Roman gladiatorial garb, Van Amburgh would bait the animals, attempting to evoke as much ferocity on their part as he could. Thereupon, he would beat them into submission. \\"His piece de resistance was forcing the lions to ... lick his boots as the ultimate sign of his conquest and the animals' abject subservience.\\" Van Amburgh's own publicity agent, Hyat Frost, reported that Van Amburgh starved his lions for three days before one of these royal command performances. They were so hungry when it came time to perform that he was forced to \\"lash them furiously with his whip 'into the most abject and crouching submission.'\\" In response to these attacks, Van Amburgh cited Bible verses to justify his touring menagerie. He quoted Genesis 1:26, arguing that God had given men dominion over animals. Thus \\"it was a religious act for trained animals to kneel at his feet.\\" He is also well-remembered for having acted out a scene from the Bible by forcing a lion and a lamb to lie down together and even inviting a child from the audience into the den. Death and legacy In August 1838, the editor of the Age reported that \\"there have already been several cases in which lions have snapped off the heads of persons persisting in this sort of foolish experiment.\\" Van Amburgh, however, was one of the few early lion tamers who died in bed. On November 29, 1865, at age fifty-four, Isaac A. Van Amburgh suffered a fatal heart attack in Philadelphia. He died a very wealthy man. Even after Van Amburgh's death, Hyatt Frost, his manager since 1865, continued using the Van Amburgh name. From him it was leased by the Ringling Brothers in 1889. Van Amburgh himself lived to hear his deeds put to a popular song, \\"The Menagerie.\\" Dr. W. J. Wetmore, M.D., published \\"Van Amburgh's Menagerie\\" in 1865, which began like this:https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/14693 .

Soaring Society of America, USPS 499-920 Design and development The HP-22 project was publicly announced in June 1984 in Soaring and, in comparison to Schreder's previous glider designs, was intended for \\"much easier building and for more versatile fun-flying when it's finished\\". The aircraft was intended to accommodate two people in side-by-side seating under a bubble canopy. The engine was to be mounted above and behind the cockpit and to retract rearward to lie in a bay when not in use. The mid-mounted wing was to have a span of and a constant chord, built with an aluminium spar, foam ribs and covered with aluminium skins. The tail would be similarly constructed. The wings also included coupled ailerons and flaps. The intention was that the flying boat hull would be constructed from four panels of PVC foam covered on both sides with fiberglass at the factory, with the builder just epoxying them together around pre-formed bulkheads. The landing gear was to consist of a retractable tricycle gear, with the main gear swiveling aft and nose wheel retracting forward to act as a docking bumper on the nose. The landing gear main wheel design included disc brakes. The planing hull featured a normal step cut out and Schreder indicated that if this was shown to create too much drag during flight testing that he would design a retractable fairing for it. His intention was to have retractable tip floats that would swing outboard to form wing tips in flight in the same manner as on the Consolidated PBY Catalina, which Schreder had flown during the Second World War. Despite its flying boat design, the HP-22 was intended as a soaring motor glider and the designer estimated its glide ratio at 30:1 and its minimum sink speed at 2.0 feet per second. Schreder started work on the HP-22 before the HP-21 was finished and did not finish, register or fly either aircraft.

Mesozoic Spiders (Araneae): Ancient Spider Faunas and Spider Evolution, Beitr√§ge zur Araneologie 9:21-408 History and classification Mongolarachne jurassica is known only from two fossils, the holotype, specimen number \\"CNU- ARA-NN2010008\\" which is a mostly complete adult female and the later described allotopotype male, number CNU-ARA-NN2011001-1 (part) and CNU-ARA-NN20110001-2 (counterpart). The individuals are preserved as compression fossils in a pale grey finely laminated sedimentary tuff. The fossil specimens are from outcrops of the Jiulongshan Formation exposed in the Wuhua Township. The type specimens is currently preserved in the Key Lab of Insect Evolution & Environmental Changes collections housed in the Capital Normal University, located in Beijing, China. Mongolarachne jurassica was first studied by Paul Selden of the University of Kansas and the Natural History Museum along with Dong Ren and ChungKun Shih both of the Capital Normal University. Their 2011 type description of the genus and species was published online in the journal Biology Letters. The etymology of the specific epithet jurassica refers to the age of the species. The genus name Mongolarachne is derived from (Inner) Mongolia, where the fossils were found, and the Latin arachne meaning \\"spider\\". The family name is a derivative of the genus name. If it had been confirmed, placement of Mongolarachne jurassica in the genus Nephila would have made it the oldest described species of the genus Nephila, extending the known fossil range of the genus back 130 million years. and making Nephila the longest lived modern spider genus known. However, with the removal of M. jurassica the oldest species in Nephila is again the Late Eocene species Nephila pennatipes from Colorados Florissant Formation. The oldest recognized member of the family Nephilidae is the Cretaceous species Cretaraneus vilaltae of Spain. Fossils of female specimens are known only from N. pennatipes, all other fossil nephilids having been described from male specimens. The placement of M. jurassica was first questioned by Kuntner et al. in 2013, who claimed that M jurassica differs from extant members of the genus Nephila in many anatomical traits and cannot be assigned to this genus, or indeed to the family Nephilidae. According to Kuntner et al. (2013) in an academic conference presentation following the description of the species Paul Selden (the first author of the description of M. jurassica) suggested that M. jurassica might be cribellate; if confirmed this would have made it the only known cribellate member of Nephila and the only known cribellate araneoid. Kuntner et al. themselves considered the presence of cribellum to be a piece of evidence that M. jurassica was not in fact a nephilid. The authors suggested that M. jurassica lacked a striated cheliceral boss, which the authors considered to be \\"a key nephilid synapomorphy\\". The authors considered it more likely that this species is actually a stem-orbicularian. This assessment was confirmed later in 2013 by Paul Selden, ChungKun Shih, and Dong Ren, with the description of a male M. jurassica which has notably different pedipalp morphology from that of male Nephila. The authors moved the species to the new genus Mongolarachne, which they assigned to a separate family Mongolarachnidae. The authors considered it most likely that M. jurassica is a stem-orbicularian, more distantly related to the group Araneoidea (including nephilids) than deinopids and uloborids are. Description The holotype female is fossilized with her underside facing up. Portions of all but two of the legs are missing from the fossil. The carapace of the holotype is and the opisthosoma is . The total body length is approximately while the front legs reach about in length. This puts M. jurassica females in the same size range as modern females of Nephila, and makes M. jurassica the largest described fossil spider. The tibia of the third leg features tufts of setae called gaiters, which are also found on the other three tibia. The feature of a gaiter on the third tibia is found only in modern Nephila and, according to the original authors of description of M. jurassica, its presence along with the large size indicated the species was part of the genus. The allotopotype male has a body length of with elongated pedipalps.

As with most HP calculators then and now, the HP-25 used RPN entry logic, with a four-level stack. It also had ten user-accessible memory registers. As was normal at the time, memory was not preserved on power-down. Its principal functions were (1) time value of money (TVM) calculations, where the user could enter any three of the variables and the fourth would be calculated, and (2) statistics calculations, including linear regression. Basic logarithmic and exponential functions were also provided. For TVM calculations, a physical slider switch labelled \\"begin\\" and \\"end\\" could be used to specify whether payments would be applied at the beginning or end of periods. It had a 12-digit LED display. A shift key provided access to functions whose legends were printed on the faceplate above the corresponding keys.

Music Bakersfield has its share of notable \\"native-born\\" musicians, including Country Music Hall of Famer Merle Haggard, renowned jazz pianist David Benoit, Hall of Fame guitarist Bill Aken (one of the first members of 'The Wrecking Crew'), country music artist Buck Owens, and American Latin jazz musician Louie Cruz Beltran. =Country= Buck Owens Crystal Palace has rapidly become the symbol of Bakersfield's country music heritage. In the 1950s and 1960s, local musicians such as Bill Woods, Tommy Collins, Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, and Wynn Stewart developed a streamlined country music style called the Bakersfield sound, which emphasized pedal steel guitar, the Fender Telecaster electric guitar and intense vocals. Bakersfield country was considered a spinoff of the honky-tonk style of country music that emerged from Texas, appropriate since many musicians there hailed from either Texas or surrounding states. Today, Bakersfield is third only to Nashville, Tennessee and Texas in country music fame, and Bakersfield continues to produce famous country music artists. The Buck Owens Crystal Palace is a respected concert venue, regularly featuring new recording artists as well as established country music stars. Buddy Alan (Buck's eldest son) performs with The Buckaroos (Doyle Curtsinger, Jim Shaw, Terry Christoffersen and David Wulfekuehler) regularly. Country music artist Gary Allan bases his music on the Bakersfield sound. =Rock= In 1972, Bob Weir released the song \\"Mexicali Blues\\" on his first solo album, Ace. Not only does the sound of the song pay tribute to the Bakersfield sound, the name of the city is referenced in the lyrics. In 1978, The Rolling Stones released the song \\"Far Away Eyes\\" on the album Some Girls. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards collaborated extensively on writing the song and it was recorded in late 1977. The Rolling Stones, longtime country music fans, incorporated many aspects of \\"Bakersfield sound\\" country music into this song. Bakersfield is mentioned in the first line of the song. In the early 1990s, a group of friends from the lower and middle-class parts of Northeast and East Bakersfield formed the band Korn. The members of the band attended Highland High School (Jonathan Davis and Reginald \\"Fieldy\\" Arvizu), East High School (James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer and former lead guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch) and South High School (David Silveria). The band has gone on to write nine full-length albums (with a 10th in production). They have also achieved multi-platinum success and won two Grammys. =Venues= Fox Theater is one of many performance venues in Bakersfield. Music is performed in a variety of locations throughout the city. The Buck Owens Crystal Palace, which symbolizes Bakersfield's country western music heritage, is a venue for that type of music. Other major theater locations include Rabobank Theater, Rabobank Arena, and the Fox Theater. There are also a variety of outdoor amphitheaters. They include: Brighthouse Amphitheater at The Park at River Walk, Outdoor Theater at Bakersfield College and Amphitheater at Cal State Bakersfield. There are additional outdoor amphitheaters (although much smaller) at Beale Park, Jastro Park, and Jefferson Park. In addition, several bars and restaurants also have space for musicians. The largest is the Nile Bar and Grill, which occupies the former Nile Theater in the Arts District, downtown. In addition to these venues, two others were proposed but were never built. For years, the Bakersfield Symphony has wanted a \\"home theater\\" to perform their music. Currently, they share the Rabobank Theater. It has been suggest that the complex be a performing arts center, with multiple theaters of varying sizes similar to the Lincoln Center in New York City or the Music Center in Los Angeles. However, the proposal has never evolved beyond the conceptual phase.Summary Report. Bakersfield Vision 2020. January, 2001. Page 43. Accessed: April 18, 2011.

Currently, there are six local theatre venues, each offering a different type of theater experience. The Bakersfield Music Theatre, also known as Stars Theatre, performs musical theatre productions at Harvey Auditorium. Stars Theatre is a dinner theatre which performs a variety of stage productions (although their theater does not have a scenery loft) in the Arts District, downtown. They also have a venue that do plays called Stars Playhouse. The Ovation Theatre performs small, intimate productions, also located in the Arts District, downtown. Typically, only a few actors are used and no sets, except for possibly a table, chair, etc. The Empty Space Theatre performs shows performed by local actors, producers, directors and stagehands. They used to do shows for free with people donating after the show is done, but they went to a more traditional payment structure. They still keep a minimum of ten seats available on donation to remember their past. Bakersfield Community Theatre is the longest continually running community theatre in California. It also has the only free summer youth theatre program in Bakersfield. Gaslight Melodrama performs melodramatic locally produced productions which typically require audience participation. Their theatre is located in Rosedale, Northwest Bakersfield.Attractions. Bakersfield Bakersfield Convention & Visitors Bureau. Accessed: April 18, 2011. In addition, Bakersfield hosts traveling productions. Most are performed at the Rabobank Theater in the Civic Center, downtown, or the Fox Theater in the Arts District, downtown.

It is an intensive 5-day course and a 3-day short course, created to familiarize students with tropical diseases they may encounter overseas. The course is open to Physicians, Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners, ESO, 18D, or other medical personnel. The course is run by the military and designed for personnel of the US Military (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force) and several other US government agencies. History Location of the Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course within Walter Reed Army Institute of Research The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) was established in 1893 as the Army Medical School by War Department General Orders No. 51, dated 24 Jan 1893.CATALOGUE OF THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS OF THE FIFTY-THIRD CONGRESS AND OF ALL DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE PERIOD FROM March 4, 1893, To June 30, 1895, page 30. The Tropical Medicine course began in that school in July 1941 while BG G. Russell Callendar was Commandant. At that time, the course ran for 30 days and consisted of didactic and laboratory sessions similar to today‚Äôs course. Very much like the majority of the 52 years that this course was offered at WRAIR, that first course presented continuing education to approximately 30 officers.The Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course (Lab Manual); Fourth edition (2011); ASIN: B0070AOM4S The course in named in honor of Walter Reed Over the next fifty years, the course changed names and length but remained dedicated to teaching continuing tropical medicine education to military officers. In 1954, the Institute began the ‚ÄúAdvanced Military Preventive Medicine Course‚Äù which carried on the tropical medicine education tradition begun in 1941. This course was eventually supplanted by the ‚ÄúGlobal Medicine Course‚Äù in December 1966. During the next four and a half years, the Global Medicine course was offered on 8 separate occasions. This 12-week course was divided into 4 weeks of ‚ÄúEpidemiology and Applied Biostatistics‚Äù, 3 weeks of ‚ÄúEcology and Disease‚Äù, and 5 weeks of ‚ÄúTropical Medicine‚Äù. In February 1972, the Global Medicine course was split into a 5-week course called ‚ÄúMilitary Medical Ecology‚Äù and a 6-week course called the ‚ÄúTropical Medicine Course‚Äù. The first Tropical Medicine Course was offered in July and August 1972 and was attended by 11 medical officers and 4 clinical clerks. The course endured until 1993 and was the only surviving remnant of the original Army Medical School educational offerings.The Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course (Lab Manual); Fourth edition (2011); ASIN: B0070AOM4S In 1991, the Institute celebrated its 50-year tradition of tropical medicine education. In memory of his significant contributions to tropical medicine education, the Institute established ‚ÄúThe Colonel George W. Hunter III Certificate‚Äù. This award was to be presented yearly to no more than two course lecturers who embody excellence and longevity as senior lecturers in the course. The first two recipients of the award were Dr. Jay P. Sanford (former University President and Dean of the Medical School at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences) and Dr. Theodore E. Woodward (Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the University Of Maryland School of Medicine). A special presentation of this award was made to Colonel Richard N. Miller, former Tropical Medicine Course Director, for his significant contributions to this course and its organization over the previous 12 years. Due to the frequency of the course changing from once a year to once a quarter, the presentation frequency of the Hunter Certificate was changed to no more than 4 per year (one per course iteration). The 50 year celebration also was particularly honored by the commencement address given by Dr. Theodore E. Woodward who attended the first course in 1941.The Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course (Lab Manual); Fourth edition (2011); ASIN: B0070AOM4S Due to operational needs of the Special Operations Command and the newly formed Africa Command, in 2010 it was decided to resurrect the former 6 week course at WRAIR and convert it to a targeted short course that would provide a broader spectrum of individuals with the knowledge they need to combat international infectious disease threats. Operational demands upon the U.S. military facing wars on multiple fronts in areas affected with tropical disease identified a vital need for an intensely focused short course to familiarize medical personnel at all educational levels in tropical medicine.The Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course (Lab Manual); Fourth edition (2011); ASIN: B0070AOM4S In 2014 the Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course was renamed 'Operational Clinical Infectious Disease' (OCID) Course. =Recipients of \\"The Colonel George W.

Specifically, this view contends: ‚Äúorganization is an effect of communication not its predecessor.\\" This perspective is part of a broader constitutive view of communication arguing, \\"elements of communication, rather than being fixed in advance, are reflexively constituted within the act of communication itself\\". CCO is one of several views or metaphors of organizing, see Images of Organization and Organizing (management) for contrasting and complementary views. There are three popular branches, schools, or perspectives of the CCO: 1) McPhee & Zaug's Four Flows 2) The Montr√©al School, and 3) Luhman's Social Systems. Background of the perspective The model of communication as constitutive of organizations has origins in the linguistic approach to organizational communication taken in the 1980s. Theorists such as Karl E. Weick were among the first to posit that organizations were not static but inherently comprised by a dynamic process of communicating. The notion of a communicative constitution of organization comprises three schools of thought: (1) The Montr√©al School, (2) the McPhee's Four Flows based on Gidden's Structuration Theory, and (3), Luhmann's Theory of Social Systems. All CCO perspectives agree that ‚Äúcommunication is the primary mode of explaining social reality‚Äù. While the Montreal School emphasizes speech acts, the four-flows highlights internal and external relations of the organization to members, members to other members, and the organization to outsiders. Luhmann contends that only decision-oriented messages allow the organization to emerge. McPhee & Zaug's Four Flows In their seminal 2000 article, which was republished in 2009 The Communicative Constitution of Organizations: A Framework for Explanation, Robert D. McPhee and Pamela Zaug distinguish four types of communicative flows generate a social structure through interaction. The flows, though distinct, can affect one another in the model and lead to multi-way conversation or texts typically involving reproduction of as well as resistance to the rules and resources of the organization. Model of the four flows or interaction processes which constitute an organization. = Organizational self- structuring = Reflexive self-structuring separates organizations from other groupings such as a crowd or mob. The self-structuring process is deliberately carried out through communication among role-holders and groups. Communication regarding self-structuring is recursive and dialogic in nature. It concerns the control, design, and documentation of an organization's relations, norms, processes, and entities. Communication of formal structure predetermines work routines rather than allowing them to emerge and controls the collaboration and membership-negotiation processes. Physical examples of organizational self-structuring include a charter, organizational chart, and policy manual. Organizational self-structuring is a political, subjective process that can be affected by systems, individuals, interests, and traditions in which it takes place. Reprinted in: It is not necessarily free of error or ambiguity. To constitute an organization, the communication must imply the formation and governance of a differentiated whole with its own reflexive response cycle and mechanisms. = Membership negotiation = Organizations are necessarily composed of, yet are distinct from, individual members. Because humans are not inherently members of organizations, negotiatory communication must occur to incorporate them. Membership negotiation links an organization to its members by establishing and maintaining relationships. Practices in membership negotiation include job recruitment and socialization. In recruitment, potential members are evaluated, both parties must agree to a relationship, and the member must be incorporated into the structure of the organization. The negotiation process can be influenced by powers including prior existence and supervision, and all parties involved may redefine themselves to fit expectations. Among higher status members, power-claiming and spokesmanship are examples of negotiation processes to gain resources of an organization. = Activity coordination = Activity coordination is a result of the fact that organizations inherently have at least one purpose to which the members' activity is contributing. Often an organization's self-structuring defines the division of labor, work flow sequences, policies, etc. that set the course for activity coordination. The structure is reflexively changing and may not be complete, relevant, fully understood, or free of problems. Therefore, a necessity of communication arises among members to amend and adjust the work process. Activity coordination can include adjusting the work process and resolving immediate or unforeseen practical problems. Activity coordination operates on the assumption that members are working in an interdependent social unit beyond the work tasks themselves. It incorporates any processes and attitudes and therefore includes coordination for members to not complete work or to seek power over one another. The work of Dr. Henry Mintzberg exemplifies activity coordination in the mechanism of mutual adjustment in his theory of organizational forms. In this example, co-workers informally coordinate work arounds for issues on the job. = Institutional positioning = Institutional positioning links the organization to the environment outside the organization at a macro level. Examples of entities outside the organization include suppliers, customers, and competitors. Communication outside the organization negotiates terms of recognition of the organization‚Äôs existence and place in what is called \\"identity negotiation\\" or \\"positioning\\". Often the communicators of this message are individuals who concurrently negotiate their own relationships but messages can come from the greater organization as a whole. Though there is not one configuration that an organization must embody, in order to be considered by peer institutions, the minimum process involves negotiating inclusion in the environment. Organizations must establish and maintain a presence, image, status, and a two-way communication channel with partners. Objects such as organizational charts can assert a particular image and demonstrate legitimacy. Organizations which are marginalized due to their lack of institutional positioning include startup companies and illegal groups such as the Mafia. Generally, the more secure an organization, the stronger relationships and control over uncertainty and resources it has in its environment. Pre-existing institutional (corporations, agencies), political, legal, cultural, etc. structures allow for easier constitution of complex organizations.  The Montr√©al School  One of the most distinctive stances of the Montreal School approach, birthed in the Universit√© de Montr√©al by James Taylor, Francois Cooren (see particularly Cooren, 2004), and Bruno Latour amongst others, is that texts have agency. Texts do something to humans that is not reducible to certain human interactions and human actions.Cooren, F. (2004). Textual Agency: How Texts Do Tings in Organizational Settings. Organization, 11, pp. 373-393. DOI 10.1177/1350508404041998 The Montreal flavor of CCO is exemplified by Taylor et al. (1996) Taylor, J. R., Cooren, F., Giroux, N., & Robichaud, D. (1996). The communicational basis of organization: Between the conversation and the text. Communication theory, 6(1), 1-39. and the volume edited by Cooren, Taylor, and Van Emery (2006).Cooren F., Taylor J. R., Van Emery E. J. (2006). Communication as organizing: Empirical and theoretical exploration in the dynamic of text and conversation. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. The Montr√©al school foregrounds process of coorientation, or the orientation of two individuals to one another, and the object of conversation. Cooren, Kuhn, Cornelissen, and Clark (2011) Cooren F., Kuhn T., Cornelissen J. P., Clark T. (2011). Communication, organizing, and organization: An overview and introduction to the special issue. Organization Studies, 32, 1149-1170. suggest that coorientation occurs when individuals focus on each other and the multitudes of agencies within the organizational environment. Cooren et al. (2011), the current leading voice in the Montr√©al school, suggests that Greimas language theory (described by Cooren & Taylor, 2006 as almost incomprehensible) and Latour‚Äôs (1995, 2005) Actor Network Theory are the basis of the Montr√©al school‚Äôs thinking. Taylor and Van Every (2001) rely on Austin‚Äôs (1962) and Searle‚Äôs (1975) Speech Act Theory. Two central terms to the Montr√©al school are derived from Austin‚Äôs work on language: text and conversation. The text represents big ‚ÄòD‚Äô Discourse in the organization, or the way people talk, while conversation represents the messages exchanged between two parties that solidify into text. In this way, Taylor et al. (1996) claim that organizations are not real in the material sense; instead, organizations are a culmination of conversations and texts. Further, Taylor et al. (1996) suggest that organizations always speak through an agent. Over the course of time, distanciation, or solidification of various texts lead to what laypeople refer to as the organization, occurs. Taylor et al. (1996) propose several degrees of separation between text and conversation. First, text is translated into action through the ability of communication to carry intention. Second, conversation turns into a narrative representation as interlocutors agree on meaning. Third, text is translating into (semi)permanent medium; for example, we write down regulations in an employee handbook. Such medium permits storage of texts to help them become conversation. Fourth, these media specialize the language as professionalism. Fifth, physical and material structures are created by the organization to perpetuate conversation. Finally, publication, dissemination, diffusion, and other forms of broadcast are employed to convey the message created by members of the organization. Through this CCO process, the social arrangements of the workplace become codified. The Montr√©al school‚Äôs proponents contend that the essence of organizing is captured in the submission, imbrication, and embeddedness of text and conversation (Schoeneborn et al., 2014).Schoeneborn, D., Blaschke, S., Cooren, F., McPhee, R. D., Seidl, D., & Taylor, J. R. (2014). The three schools of CCO thinking: Interactive dialogue and systematic comparison. Management Communication Quarterly, 28(2), 285-316. Several other key terms are related with the Montr√©al school: coorientation (Taylor, 2009),Taylor, James R. 2009 Organizing from the bottom up? Reflections on the constitution of organization in communication in Building theories of organization: The constitutive role of communication. L. L. Putnam and A. M. Nicotera (eds.), 153-186.

(Eds.), Communication as organizing: Empirical and theoretical explorations in the dynamic of text and conversations (pp. 81-100).

Organization Studies, 32(9), 1273-1294. and most recently ventriloquism (Cooren et al. 2013). Coorientation, as described above is an A-B-X relationship between two actors and an object; the object can be psychological, physical, or social. A plenum of agencies refers to the potential of both human and non-human actants (a term borrowed from Actor Network Theory; Latour, 1995) to interact within the organizational environment. Closure is the punctuation of conversations to provide deeper understanding by interlocutors. Hybridity refers to human and nonhuman actants working together to co-orient a claim. Imbrication refers to the emerging structures created by discourse in the organization over time that become an unquestioned part of what we call the organization. Finally, ventriloquism is the study of how interacts (both human and non-human) position and are positioned by the need to act via different values, principles, interests, norms, experiences, and other structures.  Luhmann's Social Systems  Luhmann's systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work. # Systems theory as societal theory # Communication theory and # Evolution theory The core element of Luhmann's theory is communication. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society. A system is defined by a boundary between itself and its environment, dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called \\"reduction of complexity\\". The criterion according to which information is selected and processed is meaning (in German, Sinn). Both social systems and psychical or personal systems (see below for an explanation of this distinction) operate by processing meaning. The third strand of CCO was first acknowledged by Taylor (1995)Putnam, L. L., Phillips, N., & Chapman, P. (1996). Metaphors of communication and organizations. In S. R. Clegg, & W. R. Nord (Eds.), Handbook of organization studies (pp. 375-408). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. but has only recently been included as a strand of CCO theorizing. Luhmann (1995)Luhmann, N. (1995). Social systems. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. claims that individuals do not create meaning, instead all meaning comes from social systems. Perhaps this is why Luhmann‚Äôs general system perspective has only recently been considered a part of the CCO body of scholarship. Luhmann takes care to define communication as a tripartite conceptualization of interactive forces. Specifically, Seidl (2014) explains that Luhmann suggests communication is an amalgam of information, utterance, and understanding. Whereas information is what is contained in a message, utterance is how the communication is conducted, and understanding ‚Äúrefers to the distinction between information and utterance‚Äù (p. 290). Luhmann‚Äôs perspective is a radical departure from traditional communication scholarship. Putnam and Fairhurst (2015) explain that the Luhmannian perspective is wholly communicative; that is, meaning is complete up to utterances in a given communicative interaction. Luhmann‚Äôs perspective gives less value to human agency in favor of a social agentic perspective. For this reason, Seidl claims that CCO research using Luhmann‚Äôs version should focus on communication not on actors. Human agency is minimized by this perspective. Psychic systems (i.e., the mind) interact with social systems (i.e., an organic conglomerate of multiple psychic systems) and human actors are not relevant to the constitution of organizations.  Similarities in CCO Perspectives  Six premises are shared by each CCO perspective. Premise 1 is that CCO scholarship looks at communication events. Any ‚Äúturn of talk, discourse, artifact, metaphor, architectural element, body, text or narrative‚Äù is potentially important in producing and reproducing the organization. Premise 2 is that CCO scholarship includes any communicative act in the analysis of organizational communication. That is, macro and micro communication matter in constituting the organization. Scholars broadly as ‚Äúthe ongoing, dynamic, interactive process of manipulating symbols toward the creation, maintenance, destruction and/or transformation of meanings which are axial‚Äînot peripheral‚Äîto organizational existence and organizing phenomena‚Äù Premise 3 is that CCO acknowledges the co-constructed/co-oriented nature of communication. Communication is not an individual experience it is an inherently social phenomenon. Meaning is an ongoing, updating, and always social process. Premise 4 is that the agent of action (both human and non-human) remains an open question. CCO theory embraces the ability of artifacts to shape the actions of members of the organization. For example, McPhee and Iverson (2009)McPhee, R. D., & Iverson, J. (2009). Agents of constitution in communidad. Building theories of organization: The constitutive role of communication, 49-87. explore how a communidad in Mexico was able take action against entities threatening land use; in this example, both humans and cattle affect who can own land and how it is used by such an unusual organization. Premise 5 is that CCO scholarship does not extend beyond the realm of communication events. This premise suggests what CCO is not: > ‚ÄúSomething as material and (apparently) inert as a building, for instance, > participates in the constitution of an organization through what it does: > sheltering operations, channeling activities, impressing visitors, > communicating some specific values, norms, and ideologies‚Ä¶ Paraphrasing the > two Jameses (Dewey and Taylor) it is in communication that such figures will > make a difference (or not) through the way their action is negotiated, > imposed or debated.‚Äù Premise 6 is that CCO favors neither organizing nor organization. That is, in the words of Putnam and Fairhurst (2015), organizations are not just continually becoming they are grounded in action. Further, these premises do not privilege any particular methodology and instead focus on an ontological and epistemological claim.

Biography Konstantin was born into a family of St. Petersburg merchants. His father had been born a peasant, but had risen to the merchant class through the selling of firewood. Konstantin was one of ten children. At the age of six he began attending a primary school. He later attended the cheap private Aimee and Kestner pensions, as well as the St. Petersburg city school, but left before completing the second form after his father went bankrupt and became a mystic. As a result, Konstantin didn't receive a formal education. He made up for his lack of education by the constant reading of magazines and books, sometimes messy, but extremely diverse. His reading was clearly on an ad hoc basis, but he was fascinated by books, becoming addicted to poetry at the age of thirteen, and beginning to write his own verses.Fofanov at the Russian Writers dictionary // \\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏\\". –ë–∏–æ–±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å. –¢–æ–º 2. –ú--–Ø. –ü–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏–µ–π –ü. –ê. –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∞. –ú., \\"–ü—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ\\", 1990 He made his debut in print in 1881. He published poems in the illustrated weeklies, and in the newspaper New Times, ran by Aleksey Suvorin. After the success of his first collection Poems (1887), Suvorin issued a second book of poetry by Fofanov with the same title in 1889. After this Fofanov published Shadows and Mystery (1892), a novella in verse The Baron Clasco (1892) and Poems (in five parts, 1896). In general, the period from the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s in the history of Russian poetry, is often called \\"Fofanovism\\" because the poetry of Fofanov had the support of popular sentiment, found a wide response from readers and provoked much imitation. His talent was praised by fellow poets Yakov Polonsky and Apollon Maykov and writers such as Leo Tolstoy and Nikolai Leskov. Fofanov is considered to be a precursor of the Symbolists.Wolfgang Kasack / –ö–∞–∑–∞–∫ –í. –õ–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–æ–Ω —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã XX –≤–µ–∫–∞ = Lexikon der russischen Literatur ab 1917 / [–ø–µ—Ä. —Å –Ω–µ–º.]. ‚Äî –ú. : –†–ò–ö ¬´–ö—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞¬ª, 1996. . –°. 440. Fofanov was an alcoholic, and in the early 1890s suffered from a severe mental illness. The last ten years of his life were spent in poverty and drunkenness.

Thomas Dunham Whitaker, 1816 engraving by William Holl the elder after a portrait by James Northcote. Life Born at Raynham, Norfolk, on 8 June 1759, he was the son of William Whitaker (1730‚Äì1782), curate of Raynham, Norfolk, and his wife Lucy, daughter of Robert Dunham, and widow of Ambrose Allen. In 1760 his father moved to his ancestral house at Holme, in the township of Cliviger, Lancashire, and the boy was in November 1766 placed under the care of the Rev. John Shaw of Rochdale. In November 1774, after spending a short time with the Rev. William Sheepshanks of Grassington in Craven, he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, and went into residence in October 1775. He took the degree of LL.B. in November 1781. His intention to enter the legal profession changed on the death of his father in the following year, when he settled at Holme. He was ordained in 1785, but remained without pastoral charge until 1797, when he was licensed to the perpetual curacy of Holme Chapel, where he had rebuilt the chapel at his own cost in 1788. He completed his degree of LL.D. in 1801. In 1809 he became vicar of the extensive parish of Whalley, Lancashire. The rectory of Heysham, near Lancaster, was presented to him in January 1813. He resigned it in 1819. On 7 November 1818 he became vicar of Blackburn, a benefice he retained, together with Whalley, until his death. When settled at Holme he instituted a local literary club. He had influence with the people of his parishes, and on several occasions exerted it to quell disturbances, particularly at Blackburn in 1817. For his 'patriotic services' he was presented with a public testimonial in April 1821. He was also very interested in topography and forestry, writing books on the subjects. In 1818 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society as \\"a Gentleman well versed in various Branches of Natural Knowledge being desirous of becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society\\" He died at Blackburn vicarage on 18 December 1821, and was interred at Holme. He married, 13 January 1783, Lucy, daughter of Thomas Thoresby of Leeds, and left several children, of whom one, Robert Nowell Whitaker, also became vicar of Whalley. A monument raised by public subscription was placed in the Church of St Mary and All Saints, Whalley in 1842. His library was sold at Sotheby's in 1823, and his coins and antiquities, with the exception of his Roman altars and inscriptions, which he bequeathed to St John's College, Cambridge, were dispersed in 1824.

At least some of his works were painted in 304 BC. No tradition of Roman painting exists earlier than the time of Fabius, nor does his example appear to have been followed by any of his contemporaries; for an interval of nearly a hundred and fifty years occurs before any mention is made of another Roman painter. Fabius, called Pictor, a Roman artist, descended from the celebrated family of the Fabii, painted principally at Rome. Pictor was the grandfather of the Roman historian Quintus Fabius Pictor. In 304 BC, Pictor decorated the Temple of Salus on the Quirinal Hill, with a representation (presumably) of the battle gained by Bubulcus over the Samnites. His paintings were preserved until the reign of the Emperor Gaius, when the temple was destroyed by fire. They were probably held in little estimation, as Pliny, to whom they must have been known, neither acquaints us with the subjects, nor commends the execution. The art of painting in its rude and early forms was general in Italy, but was founded on the Etruscan style, which never advanced beyond a flat polychromatic treatment. In painting Romans never acquired the individuality in which it did in the other arts. Painting was then little respected by the Romans, and that the title of Pictor was not considered as an honourable distinction, but rather intended to stigmatize the illustrious character who had degraded his dignity by the practice of an art which was held in no consideration, may be inferred from a passage of Cicero, in the first book of his Tusculan Disputations: \\"An censemus si Fabio nobilissimo homini laudatum esset quod pingeret, non multos etiam apud nos Polycletos et Parrhasios fuisse.\\" (That is: \\"Do we imagine that if it had been considered commendable in Fabius, a man of the highest rank, to paint, we should not have had many Polycleti and Parrbasii.\\") Notes Sources *World Book Encyclopedia.

He was also a member of the Mississippi Legislature before and during the war. Early life His grandfather Joseph Drake was one of Daniel Boone's Kentucky \\"Long Hunters\\" and was killed by Indians near Boonesborough, Kentucky in August, 1778. Sometime between 1807-1816 his family moved to Bedford County, Tennessee and later to Franklin County, Tennessee. He attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia during 1825-26. Joseph registered and was sworn in as an attorney and counselor at law of Carroll County, Mississippi in 1834. In 1835, Drake served in the capacity of district attorney of the Circuit Court of the county. He was married there on November 14, 1837 to Martha M. Burton. He represented Carroll County in the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1838‚Äì39 and was a probate Judge of Carroll County, from 1855-61. Civil War Joseph Drake was Captain of Company H, \\"Carroll County Rebels,\\" which mustered into State service at Carrollton, Mississippi August 24, 1861 and organized at Grenada, Mississippi as the Fourth Regiment, Second Brigade, Army of Mississippi, and enlisted for twelve months. He was elected Colonel on September 11 in a camp near Trenton, Tennessee. This regiment was then put under Van Dorn's command. After being promoted to major general on September 19, 1861, Van Dorn was transferred to Virginia and on October 4, was given command of the 1st Division in Beauregard's corps in the Army of the Potomac, under Joseph E. Johnston. The Fourth Mississippi infantry, which had been detached from Van Dorn's division of the Army of the Potomac, was one of the two regiments at Fort Henry which were at all experienced in war, and the men conducted themselves as veterans. Col. Joseph Drake sent two companies of Mississippians to meet the first advance of the enemy on February 4, who held the rifle-pits alone until reinforced. During the bombardment of the 6th, which resulted in the surrender of Fort Henry, Colonel Drake commanded General Tilghman's Second Brigade. After the naval attack compelled the surrender of Fort Henry, Drake retreated to Fort Donelson, where he commanded Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson's 3rd brigade. The Fourth was under fire in the trenches at Donelson during February 13 and 14, and participated in the assault which was made on the 15th for the purpose of opening a line of retreat. Gen. Johnson reported that Drake's Brigade, under its very gallant, steady and efficient commander, moved in admirable order, almost constantly under fire, driving the enemy slowly from hill to hill until about 1 p.m., when he was instructed to return to the rifle pits, leaving Drake's Brigade for a time unsupported. Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest went to Drake's support and advised him to fall back, which he did without disorder. Col. Smith's brigade advanced a short distance up the hill, repeatedly rushing and then falling to the ground in the prone position, all the while listening to taunts from Drake's Confederate brigade opposing them. The surrender followed on the 16th. It is said that Colonel Drake broke his sword and threw it in the river when told of the surrender. His son John Beckenridge Drake (1840‚Äì1922) joined Company K, 30th Mississippi infantry on February 27, 1862, shortly after his father was captured. He was imprisoned at Johnson's Island, then admitted Feb 21 1862 to U.S.A. Prison Hospital, Camp Douglas Chicago, Illinois received at Camp Chase Columbus, Ohio on March 1, transferred March 6, to Fort Warren, Boston and released on parole on 7 April for the purpose of exchange for Colonel Milton Cogswell, 42d New York Volunteers, April 11, 1862, awaiting exchange at Baltimore, to report to Maj. Gen. John E. Wool at Fort Monroe, Virginia. He retired after he was exchanged on August 27, 1862, considered too old for active service. He was 56. Postbellum career Drake returned to his plantation and served as a member the Mississippi Senate from Carroll County in 1864.

A rally car introduced in early 1995 under kit-car rules (Gr.A7K). It was used to represent the brand in various national championships such as the French Rally Championship in France in the hands of Philippe Bugalski and Jean Ragnotti, the Belgian Rally Championship in Belgium with Bernard Munster, and in the British Rally Championship with Alain Oreille and Robbie Head, with the French and British rally teams also competing in the World Rally Championship. The most notable exterior differences are wider wheel arches to accommodate bigger wheels and wider track, different front and rear bumpers and a carbon fibre rear wing. Other exterior differences are another bonnet vent for dissipating heat from the engine bay and fuel cap in a different location. The most commonly used rims were Speedline 2012 \\"Acropoli Due\\" and Speedline 2010 (used mostly on the front wheels). Rims were made from magnesium and were 16‚Ä≥ or 15‚Ä≥ for gravel and 17‚Ä≥ for tarmac stages. Suspension (3-way adjustable) was made by Proflex and track was widened to 1590 mm. The Maxi had much thicker anti- roll bars (up to 35 mm for tarmac stages). Hubs were made of aluminium and were bespoke items. Rear beam was also modified with thicker ARB and allowed different camber and toe settings. Brakes were made by Alcon. Front discs were on aluminium bells and were 332 mm in diameter with 4 pot Alcon calipers. Rear discs were 266 mm in diameter with 2 pot Alcon calipers. Roll Cage and shell reinforcements were done by Matter France. The F7R engine was tuned by Sodemo and produced around 250 hp in early evolutions (around 275 hp for last evolutions with a destroked engine). The main difference to the Gr.A car was the use of individual throttle bodies and even wilder cams. Other differences include modified head for improved gas flow and modified block for better cooling. Extremely wild cams with maximum lift up to 15 mm required the use of solid lifters and titanium valves, springs and retainers. Pistons and rods were made by Pankl. Pistons were a forged \\"slipper\\" design and rods were forged H section with custom 150 mm length to compensate for different piston compression height. Compression ratio was 12.5:1 and ran on special racing fuel. Exhaust manifold was a 4-2-1 design and was made from Inconel alloy. Clutch was made by AP Racing. Transmission was either a 6-speed Sadev manual or 6-speed RST Hewland sequential gearbox (7-speed sequential gearbox from the Megane Maxi can be retrofitted, but is not homologated). The Clio Maxi was one of the first, if not the first, rally cars with a sequential gearbox. The interior featured an instrument panel made by Stack and Magnetti Marelli, seats were made by Sabelt or Sparco. By 1996, when the Clio Williams Maxi's successor came out (Megane Maxi), 50 cars were made. More cars were made from kits, and sold direct to the customer.

The hill above was partially blasted away in the aborted effort to create an open cut, not a tunnel. Eastbound view of the interior of Roseville Tunnel, near the west portal, on April 21, 2011. A 100-foot (30 m) section of concrete lining, applied during the 1970s, failed to eliminate drainage problems. Roseville Tunnel is a two-track railroad tunnel on the Lackawanna Cut-Off in Byram Township, Sussex County, New Jersey. It is on a straight section of railroad between mileposts 51.6 and 51.8 (83 km), about west of Port Morris Junction. The tunnel was built between 1908 and 1911 by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W;) as part of the Lackawanna Cut-Off, an immense, spare-no-expense project intended to create the straightest, flattest route practicable for its main line through the mountains of northwestern New Jersey. The contractor was David W. Flickwir of Roanoke, Virginia. Originally, the DL&W; had planned to have a cut, not a tunnel, at this location. At deep, it would have been the deepest on the Cut- Off. But in October 1909, anticlinal rock was encountered, described as \\"bastard granite\\", which contractors said was \\"so brittle and soft that you could scoop it up by the handful. It was white in color and looked much like Roquefort cheese.\\" The fear was that this decayed rock could not be relied upon to provide sufficiently rigid support for a cut.The Lackawanna Railroad in Northwestern New Jersey by Larry Lowenthal and William T. Greenberg, Jr., p. 75, Tri-State Railway Historical Society, Inc., 1987.

Ultimately, some 35,000 cubic yards of material were removed to create the bore. Roseville Tunnel opened on December 24, 1911, and permitted a 70 mph (113 km/hr) speed limit. In 1958, the DL&W; single-tracked the line in anticipation of a merger with the Erie Railroad. Its successor, the Erie Lackawanna Railway (EL), shifted the remaining track in the tunnel several feet north to boost clearance for high-and-wide railroad cars. In 1976, Conrail assumed operations of the EL, but would operate the line for less than three years, placing the Cut-Off out of service in January 1979. After a protracted effort to prevent the rail from being removed failed, Conrail pulled up the tracks during the summer of 1984 and subsequently sold the right-of-way to two different land developers. The State of New Jersey acquired the right-of-way in 2001 and in 2011 NJ Transit began re-construction on the line. Rockslides A 1988 photo of a rockslide detector in Colby Cut just west of Roseville Tunnel. If a rock broke through the screen, the trackside signals would automatically be set to stop. New Jersey geology makes rockslides, which can derail trains, a constant threat in deep cuts. After the Cut-Off was closed for a month by a 1941 slide in Armstrong Cut just west of Johnsonburg, DL&W; brought in heavy equipment to lessen the slope on the cut's northern side, making it nearly impossible for another rockslide to occur there. But Roseville proved to be a different matter. Unless the Lackawanna was willing to close the line for a prolonged period, there was no way to safely scale back the tall, steep rockwalls through Colby Cut, the tunnel's western approach. Instead, after the Armstrong Cut Slide, the DL&W; paid a shantyman to watch for fallen rocks at Roseville. A hand-thrown switch had already been installed in 1913 to allow trains to shift tracks if one were blocked by fallen rocks, indicating that the railroad was acutely aware of the potential threat from almost the very beginning. In later years (probably around 1950), electronic detectors were installed that could automatically set trackside signals to red if rocks broke through the detector fencing. In the 1970s, a concrete lining was applied to the westernmost 133 feet (41 m)http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/LackawannaEAJune2008.pdf of the tunnel to prevent rockfalls inside. This work did not prevent chunks of rock from dislodging later on, after the abandonment of the Cut-Off. Rehabilitation for Andover service In 2011, New Jersey Transit received approval to re-lay 7.3 miles (11.8 km) of track from Port Morris Junction through the tunnel in order to open commuter rail service westward to Andover, New Jersey. The tunnel work, as stated in the invitation to bidders, will include: \\"removal of loose rock, rock bolting to secure unstable rock blocks, repair of the existing concrete tunnel liner, installation of a membrane liner that will provide a continuous tunnel waterproofing system, installation of CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras at both portals, and installation of a lighted pedestrian path inside the tunnel that extends a minimum of 50 feet (15 m) beyond both portals. A radio system must also be installed that provides radio signal and coverage inside the tunnel. The requirements will also include rock excavation from the west tunnel portal, effectively reducing the overall tunnel length by a minimum of 15 feet (4.6 m). The work also includes railroad track bed excavation, initial ballast placement, and rock excavation and slope protection and stabilization of loose and potentially loose rock on both the west and east rock cut approaches to the tunnel. This slope protection shall address rockfall hazard protection including construction of adequate catchment areas, the installation of cable mesh and/or netting, vegetation and tree removal, removal of loose rock and rock bolting to secure unstable blocks. The protection shall extend approximately 1,700 feet (520 m) from the west portal and 200 feet (61 m) from the east portal. The work also includes a section of track roadbed restoration beyond the west portal, including cutting, clearing, and disposal of all brush, trees, and vegetative matter, and its drainage system, approximately 8,000 feet (2460 m) long.\\" This work is to be completed within 730 days (two years). In all, the Roseville Tunnel part of the reactivation project will cost $24 million. The re-opening of the line to Andover is projected to occur no earlier than 2021.

The company was originally named \\"Mr Chip Software\\" but renamed \\"Magnetic Fields (Software Design) Ltd.\\" usually simply referred to as \\"Magnetic Fields\\", in 1988.  History  Between 1982 and 1984 they released the developed games themselves with limited success. In 1984 they ceased publishing games themselves and instead developed for Publishers Mastertronic and then later for Alternative Software, Gremlin Graphics and other publishers. Probably the best known game released under the Mr. Chip Software company name was Trailblazer which led to several sequels and ports to other systems. Most of the other games released under the Mr. Chip Software label were already focused on racing like Kikstart 2, but also some non-racing games found a fanbase like P.O.D.. Although early development was focused on the Commodore 64 and Commodore VIC-20 platforms the company widened the number of target platforms for their games in the mid 1980s. One of the other platforms included the Commodore 16, which featured a few conversions (including an impressive conversion of Trailblazer), but also a number of unique titles including Arthur Noid and Bandits and Zero. Shaun also wrote a completely different version of Kikstart for the machine to what was produced for the C64. With the switch to the \\"Magnetic Fields\\" name the company also switched from 8-Bit systems to the rather new 16-Bit systems, with their last 8-bit release being Super Scramble Simulator (a sort of silent 3rd game in the Kikstart series). While developing games belonging to many different genres, Magnetic Fields soon focussed on racing games. The 1985 release of \\"Formula 1 Simulator\\" was already technically on par with the competing racing games of that time. The company became well known in 1990 for their releases of Super Cars and Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge on most common home computer systems of the time. Especially the strong sales on the Amiga 500 and Atari ST platforms led to sequels in 1991. All three Lotus titles had the nice additional touch of including hidden games in them, with the sequel containing Shaun's classic Duck Shoot game from the Vic 20. Lotus III: The Ultimate Challenge featured on the TV series GamesMaster (S2/E11) where it was played by Formula One driver, Johnny Herbert.YouTube - Gamesmaster S02-E11 - Johnny Herbert, YouTube In 1996 the company released Network Q RAC Rally Championship for the MS-DOS platform which received many favourable reviewsexpert Reviews: Network Q RAC Rally Championship, expert ReviewsGamespot Review: Network Q RAC Rally Championship, GameSpot and led to several expansions and sequels, including the X-Miles and International Rally Championship. The last release of the company was Mobil 1 Rally Championship for Windows and PlayStation platforms in 1999. In 2000 Shaun Southern and Andrew Morris founded a new company called \\"Eugenicy\\" to develop more racing games but the company was closed down before anything was ever released.Internet Archive - Snapshot of Eugenicy Website, Internet Archive Andrew Morris released the original promotional trailer for Eugenicy on his YouTube channel in 2009.YouTube - Eugenicy Promotional Trailer, YouTube The company has agreed to let fans distribute their 8-Bit system software as long as no profit is made from these.Mr_Chip_MF_DL C64 Game Guide - Available MCS/MF 8-Bit releases, C64 Game Guide (archived)Permissions on lemon64.com This has led to additional interest in the company among users of emulators for such older hardware. Kikstart I and II were released in 2010 for the Commodore 64 emulator on the iPhone. On 5 May 2018 a retrospective video documentary/review produced by Everything Amiga was published on the subject of Kid Chaos. It tells the story of the games' troubled development history, and assesses its impact on the Amiga scene at the time, and long after. Former Magnetic Fields artist, Andrew Morris, agreed for a scan of his original protagonist concept artwork to be included. This was the first time it had been revealed to the public. 'Cosmic Kitten' (alternatively 'Claws') as he was then known was to be the Amiga's answers to Sonic the Hedgehog. However, before publication the character was re-designed as a caveboy known simply as 'Kid' to avoid any legal conflict with SEGA who have always been very protective of their intellectual property.

True to their name, they possess nine chances at life as long as they are not \\"too dead\\". In order to return to their home planet, they must give eight of their lives to a human master. The 9-Lives are treated as second-class citizens or pets. A young 9-Life named Conri is looking for his twin sister while avoiding becoming anyone's pet. While being chased for stealing some food, he is saved by a human named Adrian. Conri secretly follows Adrian back to his house and eats all his food. Adrian catches him and they come to a mutual agreement that Conri can stay in Adrian's house as long as he cleans the house. Sadly, he isn't a very good cleaner and breaks more than he cleans. Conri and Adrian go through an emergency hospital visit and get tangled up in a gang war, but in the end, they come to know more about each other and trust the other a little more.  Main characters  ; Conri: A male calico 9-Life and one of the two main characters of this story. Conri just wants to live a life of freedom while also trying to find his twin sister. He was living in hiding, avoiding possible 9-Life owners and getting angry at all the injustice he sees being done to his people such as tight collars, pornography, and wasted food (which he sees no harm in taking until he gets caught). As an angry mob chases him (for this crime), he is saved by Adrian, resulting in their future friendship. Conri is a typical cat in a human body: lazy, gluttonous, proud, likes to chase mice, and hates strong-smelling foods. He does not trust easily and at the end of the first book, it seems as though Adrian must still earn some of Conri's trust. ; Adrian: A normal human male who is unexpectedly thrown into a life with Conri. After saving the little cat-boy, he claims that he does not want nor will he ever want a pet. Little does Conri know that this decision resulted from the death of one of his past friends as they saved their pet. Because this experience was traumatic, he is distant‚Äînot really a bad person, just not wanting to get too attached to anyone or anything. He has a strange Indonesian neighbor who claims Adrian's favorite food is stinky bean paste, something that Conri strongly dislikes. Adrian's personality is honest, kind, generous, and understanding, though sometimes these traits are masked in hostility.  Memorable Quotes  ; Adrian: *(Comes through the door) I'm ho...*sees Conri and his neighbor have fallen on each other*...mo? *(Conri bites him after saving him from the mob) *SMACK!* How DARE you bite your savior!? *(After taking Conri to the hospital for slitting his wrists) You don't understand. On earth when someone tells you to drop dead, you're not supposed to take it literally. *(After a nurse says it doesn't matter if Conri would have died because of his many lives) That's horrible! EveryONE of his lives are just as precious as yours or mine! ; Conri: *(Adrian says) Isn't there ever a time you're NOT angry? *Conri thinks* When I'm eating!

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82311 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Verde in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Coast Guard Historian websiteScheina, p 72 Design and construction details Point Verde was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 After 1990 she was refit with Caterpillar diesel main drive engines. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Verde included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in- charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 History After delivery in 1961, Point Verde was assigned a homeport of Venice, Louisiana, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. In September 1965 she assisted in cleanup operations in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Betsy. Escort duty was performed in November 1965 of a raised barge carrying chlorine. After Norwegian MV Sage Sky struck a submerged object, Point Verde escorted her to Southwest Pass. The crew of Point Verde used their law enforcement experience after a knife fight aboard MV Ashley Lykes by taking two seamen into custody near Southwest Pass on 26 February 1967. On 2 April 1967 she escorted the disabled FV Lovie D. to South Pass. On 30 October 1967 she medevaced a passenger from MV Bashkara Jayanti 380 miles southeast of New Orleans. Point Verde assisted in fighting a fire on MV Gulf Supreme in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana on 25 December 1967. She towed a disabled pleasure craft near Mobile Point to Dauphin Island, Alabama on 30 October 1968. While in dry dock at New Orleans she sustained a fire during January 1969.Scheina, p 78 From 1969 to 1979 Point Verde was homeported at Dauphin Island. After 1979 she was stationed at Pensacola, Florida. On 12 June 1991 Point Verde was decommissioned and transferred to the government of Mexico.

The agency is headquartered in the city of Madrid and it extends its authority to the whole country. Apart from the AEPD, there are regional data protection agencies. These agencies have limited access to the files of public administrations because all that information remains the responsibility of the national agency. Currently there are only two regional agencies: the Catalan Data Protection Authority and the Basque Data Protection Agency. From 1995 to 2013, it also existed the Data Protection Agency of the Community of Madrid.  Legal basis and foundation  The AEPD was established by Royal Decree 428/1993 of 26 March, as amended by Organic Act 15/1999 on the Protection of Personal Data. This amendment implemented Directive 95/46/EC. The agency was created in the context of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, Article 18.4, stating that \\"the law shall restrict the use of informatics in order to protect the honour and the personal and family privacy of Spanish citizens, as well as the full exercise of their rights\\" as elaborated by Organic Law 5/1992.See espa√±ola de 1978: 03#Art_18 Wikisource for Spanish Constitution of 1978  Major activities  The AEPD is a public law authority enjoying \\"absolute independence from the Public Administration\\". It is responsible for: * Information awareness about its activities and the right to protection of personal data (including 450 interviews and 850 \\"impacts\\" on media) * Direct assistance in response to citizen queries (47,741 in 2007) * Procedures to protect rights of individuals to access, rectify, cancel, and object.

He also studied at the University of Strasbourg and the School of Political Sciences in Paris. Beginnings as a diplomat In 1909, he joined the German diplomatic corps, becoming attach√© of the embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria. In 1910, he was transferred to London, and in 1912 to Brussels. After a short period of time in Berlin with the central office of the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he moved to Madrid, where he learned to speak fluent Spanish and organized an intelligence network closely associated, apparently, to German Ambassador Leopold von Hoesch. In 1925, he married Maria Ursula von Stohrer, n√©e von Gunther. She was the daughter of cavalry officer Franz von G√ºnther and Ilse von Koch, born in Wannsee, Berlin, who spent her childhood between Berlin and the countryside. After World War I, he moved to Berlin, and rose through the ranks of the diplomatic corps. In 1927, he was named Germany's envoy to Egypt, and he negotiated a treaty of friendship between Germany and the Kingdom of Hijaz in 1929.Schwanitz, p. 132 He was an avid automobile racer and became lost during an April 1936 race between Cairo and the Bahariya Oasis.Special cable to the New York Times. \\"Reich envoy to Egypt lost in desert in an auto race\\", The New York Times.

In evolutionary theory, the court-jester hypothesis contrasts the Red Queen hypothesis.

J.B.C. Jackson, Paul N. Pearson, Andy Purvis, Robert D. Westfall, and Constance I. Millar) have started to use the term \\"Court Jester hypothesis\\" to describe the view that evolution at a macro scale is driven by abiotic factors more than the biotic competition called the Red Queen hypothesis. Content of hypothesis The court jester hypothesis builds upon the punctuated equilibrium theory of Stephen Gould (1972) Reprinted in by providing a primary mechanism for it. The 2001 paper by Barnosky that is one of the first to use the term appropriate for the Court Jester side of the debate: the Stability hypothesis of Stenseth and Maynard Smith (1984), Vrba's Habitat Theory (1992), Vrba's Turn-over pulse hypothesis (1985), Vrba's Traffic light hypothesis and Relay Model (1995), Gould's Tiers of Time (1985), Brett and Baird's Coordinated Statis (1995), and Graham and Lundelius' Coevolutionary Disequilibrium (1984) theories. Barnosky's 2001 paper that was one of the first to introduce the term, explains what the Court Jester hypothesis means, describing it as one side of a debate over: :\\"[W]hether this march of morphology and species compositions through time, so well documented not only for mammals but throughout the fossil record, is more strongly influenced by interactions among species (Red Queen hypotheses), or by random perturbations to the physical environment such as climate change, tectonic events, or even bolide impacts that change the ground rules for the biota (Court Jester hypotheses). . . . A class of alternative ideas, here termed Court Jester hypotheses, share the basic tenet that changes in the physical environment rather than biotic interactions themselves are the initiators of major changes in organisms and ecosystems. . . . Court Jester hypotheses imply that events random in respect to the biota occasionally change the rules on the biotic playing field. Accelerated biotic response (relative to background rates) is the result.\\" The Red Queen hypothesis (focusing on evolution by biotic interactions) and Court Jester hypothesis (focusing on evolution by abiotic factors such as stochastic environmental perturbations) both influence coevolutionary switching in host- parasite interaction. Barnosky acknowledges in the 2001 paper that the Court Jester hypothesis is not necessarily inconsistent with the Red Queen hypothesis: :\\"Indeed, as Ned Johnson remarked (after listening to a lecture expressing these ideas), ‚Äò‚ÄòMaybe it is time for the Court Jester to marry the Red Queen.‚Äô‚Äô That is, perhaps the dichotomy between the two hypotheses is really a dichotomy of scale, and that as we look for ways to travel across biological levels, we will find ways to resolve the dichotomies.\\"  The red queen hypothesis  The Red Queen Hypothesis is a term coined by Leigh Van Valen, in 1973, in a reference to the Lewis Carroll book Through the Looking Glass. It refers in evolution theory to the arms race of evolutionary developments and counter-developments that cause co-evolving species to mutually drive each other to adapt. There is dispute over how strongly evolution at the scale of speciation is driven by these competitions between species, and how much it is driven instead by abiotic factors like meteor strikes and climate change, but there was not an artful metaphor to capture this alternative until one was coined by Anthony Barnosky.

Passing by the Central Steel Company plant (then under construction) on a train, Fairless decided not to see the march.Hillyer, William Hurd. \\"Men of Achievement ‚Äî Benjamin F. Fairless.\\" Forbes. May 1, 1948, p. 16. Instead, he got off the train, went to the steel plant construction site, and asked the surveying team foreman for a job.Rienow and Rienow, p. 121. He was given a job on the spot.Fairless, p. 170. Accessed 2012-03-15. He was promoted from \\"transit man\\" (someone who operated a theodolite for the surveying team) to engineer when another person failed to show up for work for a week.Fairless, p. 172. Accessed 2012-03-15. After the plant was finished, he was asked to stay on at the steel mill rather than travel to another Central Steel construction site near Chicago. Early steel industry career Knowing next to nothing about the manufacture of steel, Fairless spent extra time at the Central Steel plant learning about the manufacturing process and the creation of light alloy steel.Fairless, p. 174. Accessed 2012-03-15. He was mentored by F.J. Griffiths, one of two key managers at Central Steel. By 1921, he had been promoted to mill superintendent, general superintendent, and finally executive vice president in charge of operations. In July 1926, Central Steel merged with the United Alloy Steel Corporation.\\"Alloy Steel Merger Approved By Boards.\\" Associated Press. July 23, 1926. Fairless was made vice president and general manager of the new company, Central Alloy Steel, and in 1928 promoted to president of the firm. On January 27, 1930, Central Alloy Steel merged with Republic Iron & Steel Company, Donner Steel Company, Trumbell-Cliffs Furnace Company, and the Bourne-Fuller Company to form a new firm, Republic Steel Corporation.\\"Terms of Merger for Republic Steel.\\" New York Times.

Over the next five years, Girdler made Fairless his proteg√©. Fairless became a critical manager at Republic Steel, overseeing executives and operations at Buffalo, New York; Birmingham, Alabama; Canton, Ohio; Chicago; Cleveland, Ohio; Massillon; Moline, Illinois; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Warren, Ohio.\\"Girdler Aide to Join Staff of U.S. Steel.\\" New York Times. August 22, 1935. In 1935, the U.S. Steel company, which had lost $130 million from 1932 to 1934 and was just barely breaking even in 1935, approached Fairless with the offer to become president of its newly formed Carnegie-Illinois Steel subsidiary.Fairless, p. 174, 1976. According to Fairless, Girdler then offered Fairless the presidency of Republic Steel (one of his own positions; the other was chairman of the board of directors) at a higher salary than U.S. Steel was offering. Fairless later said he knew next to nothing about U.S. Steel's operations, corporate or manufacturing structure, or merchandising. But he resigned from Republic Steel effective September 15, 1935, to join U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel career =Carnegie-Illinois Steel= On August 28, U.S. Steel announced that it was merging its Illinois Steel (headquartered in Chicago) and Carnegie Steel (headquartered in Pittsburgh) subsidiaries into a single Carnegie-Illinois Steel Company (with headquarters in Pittsburgh), and that Fairless would be president of the new company.\\"U.S. Steel to Unify Plant Operations.\\" New York Times. August 29, 1935; \\"U.S. Steel to Unify Plant Operations.\\" New York Times. September 17, 1935.

September 18, 1935. Fairless assumed the presidency of the new subsidiary on October 1, 1935.\\"Failress In New Post, Optimistic For Steel.\\" New York Times. October 2, 1935. Carnegie-Illinois rapidly expanded under Fairless. In December 1935, it opened a $35 million steel works in Clairton, Pennsylvania,\\"$35,000,000 Plant for U.S. Steel Unit.\\" New York Times. December 27, 1935. and in May 1928 another U.S. Steel subsidiary, American Sheet and Tin Plate Company, merged with it.\\"U.S. Steel Releases One Chief.\\" New York Times. May 28, 1936. During Fairless' tenure as president of Carnegie-Illinois Steel, his company was unionized. The National Labor Relations Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 5, 1935. The Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) formed as a caucus within the American Federation of Labor on November 8, 1935. The CIO was intent on organizing all workers in a plant (a philosophy known as industrial unionism), while the AFL supported organizing only highly skilled workers along job lines (known as craft unionism). In order to avoid antagonizing the AFL but eager to begin an organizing drive in steel along industrial union lines, the CIO resolved to work through the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (\\"the AA\\"), a nearly defunct steel union organized along craft lines.Brody, p. 20; Zieger, p. 29-33; Phelan, p. 129-142. Subsequently, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) was formed in Pittsburgh on June 7, 1936.Phelan, p. 136; Brody, p. 21. AFL president William Green was outraged. He denounced what he saw as the takeover of the AA on June 5, and declared that the CIO steelworker organizing drive would fail. More importantly, however, Green interpreted the move as proof that the CIO was engaging in dual unionism. After charges were drawn up and a trial conducted, on September 10, 1936, the AFL suspended the 10 unions which belonged to the CIO‚Äîincluding the AA (which was now operating as part of SWOC) among them.Phelan, p. 136-142. SWOC initially began a heavy organizing drive among steel workers nationwide, employing more than 400 union organizers.Zieger, p. 56. But the steel industry responded by almost universally creating \\"employee representation plans\\" (ERPs). These ERPs were thinly disguised company unions, and by mid-1935 nearly 90 percent of all workers in the U.S. steel industry belonged to an ERP. U.S. Steel, in particular, saw the ERPs as a legitimate way of learning about employee concerns, and the ERPs in that company began to become more independent. SWOC found little traction in the steel industry, so SWOC focused on gaining control of the ERPs in 1935 and 1936.Zieger, p. 56-59. Fairless was caught in this strategy. In July 1936, he publicly warned his employees against joining \\"outside unions\\".\\"Warns Fmployes of Stampede.\\" Associated Press. July 2, 1936. So long as the ERPs had not challenged management prerogatives or demanded pay increases, U.S. Steel was content to let them operate, even independently. But in August 1936, the ERP at Carnegie- Illinois demanded a 10 cent an hour pay increase,\\"Agree on Steel Demands.\\" New York Times. August 12, 1936. which Fairless personally denied on September 12.\\"Carnegie-Illinois Bars Pay Rise Now.\\" Associated Press. September 13, 1936. Philip Murray, director of SWOC, said Fairless' actions were not discouraging and predicted that his union would soon have enough power in the ERPs to force management to accept a collective bargaining agreement.\\"Murray Projects Steel Pay Talks.\\" New York Times. September 27, 1936. Murray proved correct: By early November 1936, Fairless had been forced to schedule a meeting for ERP representatives in the Pittsburgh area to discuss a 10 cent an hour wage increase.\\"Steel Wage Rise Reported Assured.\\" Associated Press. November 6, 1936. By November 10, Fairless had agreed to a cost of living adjustment for 53,000 of Carnegie-Illinois' 100,000 workers.\\"New Angle to One Increase.\\" Associated Press. November 11, 1936. With SWOC continuing to gain strength in Carnegie-Illinois' ERPs, in early January 1937 Fairless established a grievance committee composed of four pro-union ERP representatives with power to hear and adjudicate employee grievances, including the power to chastise managers and recommend punishment.\\"Tribunal Set Up By Carnegie Steel.\\" New York Times. January 10, 1937. But this failed to blunt the union drive. On February 11, ERP representatives throughout Carnegie-Illinois Steel demanded a $5 per day minimum wage, an 80 cent a day wage increase, and a 40-hour work week.\\"Board for Wage Rise at Carnegie- Illinois.\\" New York Times. February 12, 1937. Events elsewhere forced Fairless' hand. On Saturday, January 9, 1937, CIO president John L. Lewis had a chance encounter with U.S. Steel chairman Myron C. Taylor in the dining room at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. The two men talked animatedly at a table for a half hour, then met secretly at the Mayflower over the next two days.Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 273-274. Beginning February 17, the two men met secretly for two weeks at Taylor's Upper East Side townhouse in New York City.Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 274. On Sunday, March 1, Lewis met with Murray, CIO general counsel Lee Pressman, and Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America president Sidney Hillman and told them that Taylor had just signed an agreement agreeing to recognize SWOC as a labor union representing workers at U.S. Steel; bargain collectively with SWOC; establish grievance and seniority procedures; grant an across-the-board wage increase; establish a five-day, eight-hour workwork; and grant time-and-a-half for overtime. Lewis told Murray to appear in Fairless' office on Monday morning, where an agreement would be signed. Murray and Fairless met on March 2, and a recognition agreement was signed that day.Stark, Louis. \\"Carnegie-Illinois Confers with C.I.O.\\" New York Times. March 2, 1937; \\"Strike Is Averted.\\" New York Times. March 3, 1937. Negotiations on additional terms of the agreement began between Fairless and Murray on March 13, and a one-year agreement reached four days later that provided for seniority rights; a week of paid vacation for any worker with more than five years of seniority; two weeks' notice of dismissal; arbitration of grievances; a no-strike clause; and a clause guaranteeing employer neutrality during union elections.\\"Demands on Steel Widened By C.I.O.\\" New York Times. March 14, 1937; \\"C.I.O. Peace Pledge Given to U.S. Steel.\\" New York Times. March 18, 1937. =U.S. Steel presidency= Seven months later, Myron C. Taylor announced he was retiring as chairman of U.S. Steel effective April 4, 1938. Edward R. Stettinius Jr. was named his replacement.

October 27, 1937; \\"Big Steel Gets New Blood and Faces.\\" Life. November 8, 1937, p. 36. Accessed 2012-03-14. On December 8, U.S. Steel's board of directors agreed to reincorporate as a Delaware company and to move the corporate headquarters from New York City to Pittsburgh.\\"U.S. Steel to Move to Pittsburgh Jan. 1.\\" New York Times. December 9, 1937. The following day, Fairless was named chairman of the board's executive committee.\\"Fairless to Head New U.S. Steel Unit.\\" New York Times. December 10, 1937. In 1938, Fairless' first year as president of U.S. Steel, an indefinite extension was negotiated to the SWOC collective bargaining agreement, effectively preventing a major wage cut at the company.\\"U.S. Steel Extends C.I.O. Pay Contract.\\" New York Times. February 10, 1938. In April, Fairless was also named the chief administrative officer of the company.\\"Three Are Named to Guide U.S. Steel.\\" New York Times. April 6, 1938. The following year, Fairless embroiled U.S. Steel in an investigation into monopolies. The Temporary National Economic Commission, with membership drawn from Congress as well as the Federal Trade Commission, was created in 1938 to investigate monopolies in key sectors of the economy.Zey, p. 193. In November 1939, Fairless admitted to the committee that steel companies often consulted one another when setting prices.\\"Fairless Admits 'Extra' Price Talks.\\" New York Times. November 8, 1939. His comments ignited a firestorm of controversy. Nathan L. Miller, former Governor of New York and U.S. Steel's general counsel, testified that he had advised the company that such consultations were legal.\\"Trust Law Advice to U.S. Steel Is Told.\\" New York Times. November 9, 1939. Fairless and other steel executives hurriedly testified again before the committee, attempting to downplay the nature of these talks.Austin, Kenneth L. \\"Steel Status Seen Clarified By Talks.\\" New York Times. November 19, 1939. Fairless was called to testify before the committee a third time in January 1940.\\"To Resume Steel Inquiry.\\" New York Times. January 22, 1940. He successfully defended the steel industry's practice before the committee,\\"Fairless Defends Steel Price System.\\" New York Times. January 30, 1940. although the arguments used would later lead to amendments to U.S. antitrust law. Fairless was also active in mobilizing the U.S. steel industry for defense purposes during World War II. Initially, Fairless argued against allowing the United States to enter the war in Europe, and believed that the U.S. embargo on steel sales to American allies in Europe should not be lifted.\\"Steel Men at Odds on Embargo Action.\\" New York Times. September 27, 1939. But by February 1941, Fairless had come to see the necessity of rapid expansion of domestic industry to meet the increasingly likely threat of war. He joined with a group of other top steel executives and met with William S. Knudsen, an automotive industry executive who had been appointed Director of the Office of Production Management (a federal agency tasked with promoting defense mobilization). Fairless agreed to increase steel production and devote more steel to defense rather than consumer needs.Hurd, Charles. \\"Steel Men Pledge Full Defense Aid.\\" New York Times. February 1, 1941. On February 19, Fairless and Ransom E. Olds (founder of Oldsmobile) met with President Roosevelt in the White House to discuss mobilization needs.\\"Roosevelt Conf with B. F. Fairless and R. E. Olds.\\" New York Times. February 20, 1941. In mid-March, Fairless formed and chaired an Iron and Steel Industry Defense Committee to help improve steel and iron production even further.Austin, Kennth L. \\"Steel Committee to Aid in Defense.\\" New York Times. March 16, 1941. More than 140 steel companies formally joined the committee at its first meeting in May 1941.\\"Steel Men Set Up Group for Defense.\\" New York Times. May 8, 1941. Fairless' commitment to defense mobilization led to clashes with labor unions, however. In April 1941, Fairless agreed to a 10 cents an hour wage increase to avert a SWOC strike in steel.\\"Strike Is Averted in Steel Industry By Wage Increase.\\" New York Times. April 15, 1941. But seven months later, Fairless refused to give in when John L. Lewis and the United Mine Workers (UMW) demanded a union shop clause in contracts with mines owned by steel companies. Lewis, who believed that labor standards would be frozen in the forthcoming war, wanted these so-called \\"captive mines\\" to grant the union shop as all other mining companies had.Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 397. Steel company executives resisted this demand for fear they would be forced to grant it in their steel mills as well.Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 398. Myron C. Taylor, still on the U.S. Steel board of directors, wrote a confidential letter to President Roosevelt offering to agree to the union shop in captive mines but only if Roosevelt issued an executive order or Congress enacted legislation requiring it. His reasoning was that federal action would enable the steel companies to resist agreeing to union shops in steel mills. On September 15, the UMW went out on strike. Lewis agreed to resume work after a week in order to allow the National Defense Mediation Board (NDMB; a federal agency established to provide quick resolution of labor disputes in defense- critical industries) to study the matter. The UMW walked out again on October 28, and two days later Taylor and Lewis agreed to allow the entire NDMB to rule on the issue. But unexpectedly, the NDMB ruled 9-to-2 against the union shop provisions on November 10.Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 402. Lewis set a new strike date of November 15, and on November 13 Fairless predicted that any coal strike in the \\"captive mines\\" would be a short one.\\"Predict Quick End of a Coal Strike.\\" Associated Press. November 13, 1941. Roosevelt summoned Fairless; Eugene Grace, president of Bethlehem Steel; and Frank Purnell, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube, to the White House on November 14 along with Lewis and two other top UMW leaders. He told them that neither he nor Congress would order a union shop, and asked that work continue in the mines while the two sides negotiated.Stark, Louis. \\"President Is Stern.\\" New York Times. November 15, 1941. But Fairless reported that no progress was made, and Lewis threatened to close all coal mines nationwide.Lawrence, W.H. \\"53,000 Told to Quit.\\" New York Times. November 16, 1941; Lawrence, W.H. \\"Refuse Union Shop.\\" New York Times. November 17, 1941. Violence between striking miners, law enforcement officials, and miners willing to cross picket lines broke out almost immediately, and some miners in non-captive coal mines walked off the job in solidarity with the steel company miners.Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 403. Roosevelt asked Lewis to agree to allow the NDMB arbitrate the decision, but Lewis said Roosevelt had shown such prejudicial behavior already that he would not do so.Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 403-404. On November 22, Roosevelt asked Fairless, Lewis, and Dr. John R. Steelman (professor of economics and former director of the U.S. Conciliation Service) to form a committee to arbitrate the dispute themselves.Lawrence, W.H. \\"Dr. Steelman Chief.\\" New York Times. November 23, 1941. Although Lewis knew that Steelman favored the union shop,Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 404. the steel companies accepted the arbitration agreement without that knowledge. Nonetheless, the government board provided the steel companies with the cover they needed to oppose the spread of the union shop into the steel mills, and steel companies and \\"captive mine\\" owners agreed to accept the arbitration panel's decision.\\"Steel Leaders See All Accepting Pact.\\" New York Times. November 29, 1941. The panel voted 2-to-1 (with Fairless still defending the open shop) to grant the union shop on December 7, 1941.\\"Lewis Wins Captive Mine Fight.\\" New York Times. December 8, 1941. =War years= December 7, 1941, also proved to be the start of World War II for the United States. During the war, Fairless led U.S. Steel in rapidly increasing production. In 1943, however, the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Company was found to be supplying inferior steel to the United States Navy. The informer was fired by Carnegie-Illinois, and subsequently sued for $2 million under a law enacted during the American Civil War.\\"'Informer' On Steel Sues for $2,000,000.\\" New York Times. March 25, 1943. Fairless angrily defended U.S. Steel from accusations of war profiteering, and announced an investigation into the shipments of inferior steel. Three weeks later, Fairless personally testified before the War Production Board that several managers at Carnegie-Illinois had falsified tests so that inferior grade steel could be sold to the government, and had pocketed the money saved as profits. He said he had fired the individuals responsible.\\"Ousts Falsifiers of Tests on Steel.\\" New York Times. April 9, 1943. In October 1943, President Roosevelt asked Fairless to sit on a new advisory panel on eliminating bottlenecks in steel production.\\"President Meets With New Industry Body.\\" New York Times. October 28, 1943. Fairless again confronted the UMW in late 1943. Throughout the year, UMW members had engaged in wildcat strikes against various sectors of the coal industry, demanding wage increases significantly higher than those granted in other industries by the National War Labor Board (which, in exchange for a no-strike pledge by the nation's labor unions, had achieved complete legal authority to approve all union contracts).Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 420-438. These strikes, Fairless said, significantly impeded U.S. Steel's ability to meet production goals.\\"U.S. Steel to Miss New Output Mark.\\" New York Times. November 19, 1943. Although wage increases were inflationary, Fairless announced on December 8 that he was reopening negotiations with SWOC in order to award a pay increase and attempt to raise production.\\"U.S. Steel Agrees to Wage Parleys.\\" Associated Press. December 9, 1943. SWOC asked for back pay to make up for purchasing power lost due to severe wartime inflation. But Fairless refused to consider this request.\\"U.S. Steel balks at Back-Pay Rise.\\" New York Times. December 18, 1943. More than 170,000 SWOC members went out on strike. Fairless gave in to union demands on December 28.\\"Steel Strike Ends With Rush to Work.\\" Associated Press. December 29, 1943. Fairless was infuriated by the negotiations and subsequent contract, and in January 1944 said that he favored a return to the open shop as a means of reining in SWOC's power at the bargaining table.\\"Fairless Attacks Job Rule By Union.\\" New York Times. January 21, 1944. In August 1944, Blaine Fairless wed Caroline Sproul. Less than two months later, Benjamin Fairless married Hazel Hatfield Sproul on October 14, 1944. She was the daughter of Dr. Henry D. Hatfield, a physician, former Governor of West Virginia, and former United States Senator from West Virginia. She had only recently divorced John Roach Sproul, son of William Cameron Sproul (a former Governor of Pennsylvania). The couple were married by the pastor of the Shadyside Presbyterian Church at Mrs. Sproul's parents' home in Huntington, West Virginia.\\"Benjamin Fairless to Wed Mrs. Sproul.\\" New York Times. October 14, 1944; \\"Mrs. Sproul, Bride of U.S. Steel Head.\\" New York Times. October 15, 1944. =Post-war years= As World War II ended, Fairless led U.S. Streel through yet another major steel strike. The United Steelworkers demanded a significant pay increase in order to once more bring pay in line with the heavy inflation brought about by the war. With prices still strictly regulated by the federal government, in November 1945 Fairless refused to grant any pay increase unless the government approved a $2 per ton increase in the price of steel.\\"Fairless Opposes Rise in Steel Pay.\\" New York Times. September 15, 1945. Secretary of Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach urged the parties to come to an agreement out of a concern for national security,\\"Calls on U.S. Steel to Settle Dispute.\\" United Press International.

Steel industry executives asked the National Labor Relations Board to prevent a strike, but the agency said it lacked the power.\\"NLRB Admits Power Lack To Halt Any Strike Vote.\\" New York Times. November 9, 1945. The Office of Price Administration on November 24 declined to permit a price increase, arguing it would violate its price regulations.\\"Steel Price Rise Rejected By OPA.\\" New York Times. November 24, 1945. But the union agreed to a 30-day cooling off period, and on December 31 President Harry S. Truman won agreement from Fairless and Murray to establish a fact-finding board to study the issue.Whitney, Robert F. \\"President Names Steel Fact Board, Asks Price Study.\\" New York Times. January 1, 1946. One week later, the president conferred with OPA Administrator Chester Bowles, and Bowles agreed to consider a $2.50 per ton increase in the price of steel.Stark, Louis. \\"Truman Intervenes in Steel Price Case.\\" New York Times. January 8, 1946. But OPA's fact-finding was nowhere near complete. With the steel strike scheduled to begin on January 13, Truman summoned Fairless and Murray to the White House on January 11.Porter, Russell. \\"Steel Leaders Summoned to Confer in White House.\\" New York Times. January 12, 1946. Truman convinced Murray to delay the strike one week, but the two sides were still far apart on the pay rise (Murray demanding 19 cents an hour, and Fairless offering just 15 cents an hour).Stark, Louis. \\"Truman Plea Wins.\\" New York Times. January 13, 1946. On January 13, Fairless consulted with other steel industry executives about the talks.\\"Fairless Here for Talks.\\" New York Times. January 14, 1946. The following day, Truman indicated publicly that he would approve a $4 per ton price increase, but only if the two sides came to agreement via collective bargaining on a wage increase.Stark, Louis. \\"$4 Steel Price Rise Hinges On Pay Pact Barring Strike.\\" New York Times. January 15, 1946. Murray indicated he would accept Truman's offer.Stark, Louis. \\"Replies Due Today.\\" New York Times. January 18, 1946. But Murray also reportedly said that the steel industry was engaged in a \\"conspiracy\\" to destroy the labor movement, a statement which outraged Fairless and led to a breakdown in talks.\\"Fairless Says Murray Told 'a Base Falsehood'.\\" New York Times. January 19, 1946; \\"Says Steel Fights for Its Consumers.\\" New York Times. January 23, 1946. With no resolution, the strike occurred as scheduled on January 19. Fairless denounced the strike as an attack on the president's wartime reconversion program, industry, and the public good.Raskin, A.H. \\"States Steel Case.\\" New York Times. January 24, 1946. On January 24, Fairless asked the president to call a national wage and price conference covering all major industries to establish new national wage and price levels.Raskin, A.H. \\"Fearless First Offered Plan At White House, Aide Says.\\" New York Times. January 25, 1946. But Truman rejected the plan, and reiterated that his basic proposal from January was the only one he would consider.Stark, Louis. \\"President Is Sharp.\\" New York Times. January 25, 1946. On January 28, Fairless opened talks with the United Steelworkers.Stark, Louis. \\"Hear Steel Seeks Pledge on Prices.\\" New York Times. January 29, 1946. As the strike continued into February 1946 without resolution, Congress began holding hearings on the issue. On February 9, Murray testified that Fairless had offered him a 19 cents per hour wage increase on January 12.\\"Murray Testifies He Got 19 C Offer.\\" New York Times. February 10, 1946. Congressional and public opinion turned against Fairless, and on February 15 he and Murray agreed to an 18 cent an hour wage increase. Strikes during and shortly after World War II convinced many in Congress that federal labor law should be amended to prevent these threats to national security. In 1947, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act over Truman's veto. The legislation established a National Labor-Management Panel to advise the president on how to avoid major disruptions in critical economic sectors in the future. In December 1947, Truman appointed Fairless to this panel as one of six representatives from industry.\\"Truman Names 12 to Taft Act Panel.\\" New York Times. December 19, 1947. When the 1946 collective bargaining agreement expired in 1949, the United Steelworkers demanded that U.S. Steel provide each worker a pension. The Taft-Hartley Act's provisions permitting an injunction against a strike in an industry critical to national security were invoked an hour after the United Steelworkers walked off the job on July 7.\\"Murray Hints at 'Rolling Strike'.\\" United Press International.

July 15, 1949. and President Truman accepted the plan the following day.Stark, Louis. \\"Steel Walkout Is Averted.\\" New York Times. July 16, 1949. As the fact-finding board conducted its hearings, in August Fairless publicly denounced what he called was \\"dictatorial\\" governmental regulation of wages and prices.\\"Peacetime Dictation Assailed by Fairless.\\" New York Times. August 6, 1949. On September 14, the fact-finding board issued its report, and said that U.S. Steel should provide pensions for its workers. Fairless denounced the recommendation as a \\"revolution\\" against free enterprise, and rejected the fact-finding panel's report wholesale.Raskin, A.H. \\"U.S. Steel Rejects Findings of President's Fact Board as 'Revolutionary Doctrine'.\\" New York Times. September 15, 1949. Nonetheless, Fairless agreed to attend a mediation session in Washington, D.C., two days later.\\"Steel Disputants Accept Bid By U.S. to a Parley Monday.\\" New York Times. September 17, 1949. On September 17, Murray accused Fairless of imposing a double standard on workers when he revealed that U.S. Steel was paying the pensions of its executives.\\"'Double-Standard' Charged to Steel.\\" New York Times. September 18, 1949. Public opinion turned sharply against Fairless, and with the Taft-Hartley injunction due to expire Murray announced that the union would strike.Stark, Louis. \\"Steel Must Accept Pensions Or Face Strike, Murray Says.\\" New York Times. September 20, 1949. Fairless opened bargaining with the union, and President Truman won a postponement of the strike until October 1 in order to allow negotiations to bear fruit.Stark, Louis. \\"Truman Asks Steel Truce to Oct. 1, New Bargaining.\\" New York Times. September 22, 1949. But the negotiations did not result in a contract, and the union struck on schedule.Raskin, A.H. \\"Parleys Collapse.\\" New York Times. October 1, 1949. Murray announced on October 13 that the union would settle for a pension plan funded by a 29 cents per hour contribution from U.S. Steel.Raskin, A.H. \\"29c Steel Pension Is Cited By Murray.\\" New York Times. October 14, 1949. Fairless continued to resist the pension plan idea. But as layoffs spread throughout the steel industry, other steel companies began meeting with Ching to seek a resolution. On October 18, Fairless quietly sent an aide to meet with Ching and to discuss the pension plan proposal.Raskin, A.H. \\"Ching to Bid Today for Peace in Steel as Layoffs Spread.\\" New York Times. October 19, 1949. On October 31, Bethlehem Steel reached an agreement with the United Steelworkers that implemented a pension plan. Under pressure to agree to the same terms, Fairless agreed to meet with Ching and Murray.Raskin, A.H. \\"U.S. Steel Bid Spurs Hope For Quick Peace in Industry.\\" New York Times. November 1, 1949. But no agreement was forthcoming. Jones & Laughlin Steel signed a pension plan deal with the union on November 7,\\"Jones & Laughlin Signs With Union.\\" New York Times.

With all the other major steel companies resuming production, Fairless set aside his previous opposition to the pension plan and signed with the union on November 11.Levey, Stanley. \\"U.S. Steel Signs 2-Year Union Pact.\\" New York Times. November 12, 1949. Fairless subsequently approved a large increase in the price of steel in December 1949. Fairless was strongly criticized by members of Congress for this price increase, but he defended it as absolutely necessary given the recent wage negotiations.Mullaney, Thomas E. \\"Head of U.S. Steel Defends Price Rise, Welcomes Inquiry.\\" New York Times. December 17, 1949. Congress opened hearings into steel industry pricing in January 1950, and Fairless was called to testify. On January 24, Fairless testified that the price increase was caused by the recent collective bargaining agreement.Cloke, H. Walton. \\"Testifies on Steel Rates.\\" New York Times. January 25, 1950. But the pressure on Fairless did not abate. Congress held additional hearings in April. Several members of Congress accused Fairless of being part of an illegal cartel to keep steel prices high, an accusation Fairless categorically denied on April 24.\\"Fairless Denies Pact.\\" New York Times. April 25, 1950. Two days later, however, the United States Department of Justice opened a legal inquiry into interlocking boards of directors in the steel industry.Egan, Charles E. \\"Steel Official Faces Justice Action Over Interlocking Directorships.\\" New York Times. April 26, 1950. Fairless denounced the inquiry, declaring it an attack on business.Egan, Charles E. \\"Fairless Strikes Back at Critics.\\" New York Times. April 27, 1950. Although no legal action was taken against Fairless by the Justice Department, Fairless later called for major revisions in U.S. antitrust law to clarify rules regarding interlocking directorships, price fixing, and other business consultations.Fenton, John H. \\"Fairless Demands Trust Act Revision.\\" New York Times. May 19, 1950. In 1945, when Fairless was still President of USS, he met with a mining engineer named Mack Lake. Lake told Fairless that he believed there was iron ore in Venezuela, south of the Orinoco River. He asked Fairless to subsidize the research for the ore and Fairless agreed. Lake proved there was massive quantities of high grade ore in that area. U.S. Steel bought and developed the Orinoco Ore Mine. Under pressure from the Truman Administration to increase steel capacity as a pre-emptive measure in response to the Cold War, U.S. Steel and Fairless began drawing up plans for a totally new and modern steel mill on the East Coast to take advantage of the Venezuela Orinoco ore. A site was chosen on the east border of Pennsylvania on the Delaware River 30 mile north of Philadelphia, near Morrisville, Pa. Ore ships could steam from Venezuela and up the Delaware to unload without travelling the Panama Canal, saving shipping costs. Ben Fairless oversaw every aspect of the new mill's design and construction. The new Fairless Works was named after him. His daughters and granddaughters helped to christen and start the new Fairless Works on December 11, 1952. Retirement In retirement, Fairless remained active in business affairs and public service. In May 1955, he was elected president of the American Iron and Steel Institute.\\"Fairless Heads Steel Institute.\\" New York Times. May 27, 1955. In January 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower named Fairless to the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities (a predecessor to the President's Intelligence Advisory Board).Leviero, Anthony. \\"President Names Board to Review U.S. Intelligence.\\" New York Times. January 14, 1956. In September 1956, President Eisenhower appointed Fairless chairman of International Development Advisory Board, a new federal commission of leading citizens charged with studying American foreign aid policies and making recommendations regarding its distribution.Schmidt, Dana Adams. \\"Fairless to Lead Study of U.S. Aid.\\" New York Times. September 6, 1956. Over the next four months, Fairless and the other members of the commission traveled around the globe, observing foreign aid projects and interviewing officials in other governments. The advisory board issued an interim report on December 22 that advocated fewer funds but easing restrictions on their use.White, William S. \\"Foreign Aid Study Asks Freer Trade.\\" New York Times. December 23, 1956. But when the board's final report came out in March 1957, it backed off the reduction in funds. Rather, Fairless and the advisory board members advocated keeping funding at current levels, easing restrictions on their use, and reducing barriers to international trade to encourage economic growth so that fewer funds would be necessary.Dale, Jr., Edwin L. \\"Aid Study Backs Outlays Abroad At Present Pace.\\" New York Times. March 6, 1957. Fairless also urged Congress to expand American foreign aid programs to nations which had chosen a neutral role in the Cold War.Dale, Jr., Edwin L. \\"U.S. Urged to Aid Backward Lands, Neutral Or Not.\\" New York Times. March 8, 1957. Death Fairless retired to his home in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. On November 2, 1961, he sued for divorce from his wife on grounds that she had publicly humiliated him and committed \\"indignities\\".\\"Fairless Sues for Divorce.\\" Associated Press. November 4, 1961. The divorce was granted in early December 1961. He was hospitalized with pleurisy in mid-November 1961, and died on January 1, 1962.

Its several variants sold in large numbers. In 1987 a Flyer became the first ultralight to land at the North Pole. Design and development The kitbuilt two seat lightplane was designed by Dean Wilson in 1983, the first prototype flying in 1983 and appearing at Oshkosh that year. Kits were produced by Light Aero with several names (Bandit, Lite, Magnum and Mk.IV) with many options including two wing designs, the choice of tricycle, tailwheel, ski or float undercarriages, rescue parachutes and a variety of engines. Lite Aero production continued until the company went bankrupt in 1998. Avid Aircraft reappeared in 2003, but by 2010 the kits, including new variants, and components were produced by Airdale Flyer. Avid Flyer Hi-Gross The Avid Flyer is a conventional layout, single engine, side by side two seat light aircraft, with a strut-braced high wing configuration. Aluminum tubes serve as leading edge/main spar and rear spar, each wing being supported by a pair of tubular lift struts. Sawn plywood wing ribs are bonded to the aluminum tube spars using a filled epoxy compound. The Avid Flyer features Junkers style one-piece flaperons supported by three offset hinge arms. The Junkers design moves the control surfaces well underneath the wing, where they remain in undisturbed smooth airflow at low speed and/or higher climb angles. The welded steel tube fuselage is flat sided, narrowing towards a braced cruciform tail group. The horizontal tailplane is carried on the fin just above the upper fuselage line. The aircraft's conventional rudder and elevator controls are cable operated. Wilson's original intent developing the Avid Flyer was to offer an economical home-built aircraft to bridge the gap between conventional aircraft of the \\"Piper Cub\\" / \\"Taylorcraft\\" / \\"Aeronca\\" category and the minimalist ultralight aircraft such as the \\"Quicksilver\\" that had not yet matured into acceptable levels of reliability and safety in the early 1980s. The ability to fly from short, unimproved, and back-country strips was also one of Wilson's design priorities. Due to its light weight, good power-to-weight ratio, and design features such as the Junkers flaperons, the Avid Flyer excels in this type of environment and STOL operations. Recent developments in small aircraft engine design and reliability have brought the Avid Flyer well into the realm of being seen as a highly capable and economically viable choice for light sport use. Operational history By about 2008, some 2,000 Flyer kits had been built over five continents. 346 Flyers and Magnums appear on the European (excluding Russian) civil registers. Perhaps the most remarkable flight was that made by Hubert de Chevigny in an Avid Lite 532 equipped with an additional 300 L (66 Imp gal, 79 US gal) fuel tank. Accompanied by Nicholas Hulot in an Aviasud Mistral, he left from Resolute, Canada on 2 April 1987, reaching the North Pole on 7 May in three stages. They were the first ultralights to do so.

The incidents were the cause of the destruction in Trieste of the Hotel Balkan by Italian Fascists. Background Location of the Adriatic Sea. The confrontations were the product of a centuries-long struggle for the control of the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea between South Slavs and Italians. During the second half of the 19th century Split saw antagonism between the pro-Italian Autonomist Party and the pro-Yugoslav People's Party. Hostilities between the two ethnicities increased after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when Italian irredentists called for the annexation of several formerly Austro-Hungarian cities on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, which were home to both South Slavs and Italians, into Italy, and occupied several of them by force. Population According to the 1910 census the population of Split numbered 20,275, of which 18,176 (85.18%) were Croats or Serbs (Croats were the majority, but the census made no distinction between the two), while 2,082 (9.73%) were Italians.G.Perselli, I censimenti della popolazione dell'Istria, con Fiume e Trieste, e di alcune citt√† della Dalmazia tra il 1850 e il 1936, Unione Italiana Fiume-Universit√† Popolare di Trieste, Trieste-Rovigno 1993 In the city of Split there was an autochthonous Italian community, which was reorganized in November 1918 through the foundation of the \\"National Fasces\\" (not related to fascism) led by Leonardo Pezzoli, Antonio Tacconi, Edoardo Pervan and Stefano Selem, former members of the Autonomist Party, which had been dissolved by the Austrian authorities in 1915. This census data had understated the number of Italians in the city area and this mistake seems to be confirmed by a series of subsequent events. Indeed, following the Treaty of Rapallo, the Italians of Dalmatia could opt for the acquisition of Italian citizenship instead of the Yugoslavian one, while maintaining residence: despite a violent campaign of intimidation on the part of Yugoslavia, over 900 families of Italian speaking \\"Spalatini\\" had exercised the option to be Italians.Luciano Monzali.Antonio Tacconi e la comunit√† italiana di Spalato p. 165 Furthermore, a Census of Italians living outside Italy was carried out in 1927: in Spalato and surrounding area 3,337 Italian citizens were counted.Luciano Monzali. Antonio Tacconi e la comunit√† italiana di Spalato p.167 According to Antonio Tacconi, given that about 1,000 Italians left the city following its incorporation into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and estimating that a certain percentage of Italians accepted the Yugoslavian citizenship, it is possible to estimate the Italian population of Split in 1918/1919 in 7.000 people. This number is obtained by analyzing the membership in Italian associations of Spalato in 1918/1919. This amount is more than 3 times the data from the 1910 Austrian Census. History After the Austrian defeat, in the first half of November 1918 Italian troops unilaterally occupied territories of Austria-Hungary promised to Italy by the secret 1915 Pact of London.L. Monzali, Italiani di Dalmazia. 1914‚Äì1924(section: Un difficile dopoguerra. L'occupazione italiana della Dalmazia settentrionale) p. 50 Split was not one of those areas and was placed under Allied military occupation; the Italians sent two warships - the torpedo boat Riboty and the protected cruiser - while the Italian minority publicly demanded the annexation of the city into Italy, supported by some Italian political circles. At the same time, Croats formed the National Guard, a local militia to guarantee public order. On 9 November 1918, two French destroyers entered the port of Split. The Italians displayed the flag of Italy in the windows of their homes to give the impression citizens supported Italy's bid for annexation. This however incited a riot and the flags were torn down. The commander of a former Austrian ship already docked at the port ordered the removal of the flags. Other incidents and demonstrations against Italy happened in other cities, like Trogir and the Ka≈°tela. Italian Admiral Enrico Millo, appointed temporary military commander for the parts of Dalmatia occupied by Italy, unilaterally dispatched Italian naval vessels to the city. On 12 January, Puglia arrived among large protests.Silvio Salza. La marina italiana nella grande guerra p.808 On 12 September 1919, Gabriele D'Annunzio led around 2,600 rebel troops from the Italian Army - some units of the Sardinia Grenadiers - Italian nationalists and irredentists to seize the Adriatic port city of Fiume, forcing the withdrawal of the inter-Allied (American, British, Italian and French) occupying forces, and later proceeding south to occupy the Dalmatian city of Zara. As a consequence armed nationalist irregulars commanded by Dalmatian Italian Count Fanfogna proceeded further south to Split's neighbouring city of Trogir and organized a similar occupation, quickly nipped by the Allies.New York Times: Count Fanfogna \\"Dictator\\" of Trogirhttps://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship- histories/danfs/o/olympia.htmlUnited States Army and Navy Journal and Gazette of the Regular and Volunteer Forces, Volume 57, Part 1 In Split, located just south across the Ka≈°tela Bay from Trogir, the citizens feared their (significantly larger) city would be next in line, and that the joint Allied military administration would once again stand aside while another Dalmatian city came under the control of armed Italian nationalist irregulars.G.Menini, Passione adriatica. Ricordi di Dalmazia 1918‚Äì1920 p.187-188 =27 January Split incident= The fear of an annexation by Italy led to a violent attitude by some members of the Croat majority towards the Italian minority; both in Split and Trogir, Italians were assaulted in several instances and their property damaged, especially after Fanfogna's attempt to seize Trogir. The most serious incident happened on 27 January 1920, after the Allies had sent to Belgrade an unwelcome note about the settlement of the new Italian-Yugoslav border. A public rally against Italian imperialism was organized, but it ended in an assault on the offices of some Italian associations and about twenty Italian shops, whose signs, shutters and windows were shattered.Luciano Monzali, Antonio Tacconi e la comunit√† italiana di Spalato, Venezia, 2007.Gli incidenti di Spalato.Mladen ƒåuliƒá Dalbello, Antonello Razza, Per una storia delle comunit√† italiane della Dalmazia, Trieste, 2004. =11 July Split incident= On 11 July 1920, street conflict erupted between Italians and Croats. Accounts diverge about the cause of these clashes: according to Croat sources, they were triggered by the removal of a Yugoslav flag by two officers from Puglia; according to Italian sources, they were started by people who had just attended to a conference held by a Croat nationalist.Valentina Petaros Jeromela, 11 luglio 1920: l'incidente di Spalato e le scelte politico- militari, in Quaderni - Centro di Ricerche Storiche Rovigno, XXV, Universit√† Popolare Trieste, 2014, pp. 307-336.O po≈æigu Narodnega doma v Trstu, Delo, 13 July 2010 During the riots, a group of officers of Puglia found refuge in a place near the docks: captain Gulli ordered a boat under the command of lieutenant Gallo to rescue them, but it was blocked by the crowd. Gallo then fired \\"warning shots\\" into the air.G.Menini, Passione adriatica. p.207 Soon captain Gulli went ashore himself on a motorboat, but on approaching the docks found a large crowd and shots were exchanged. A hand grenade thrown at the vessel fatally wounded sailor Aldo Rossi and hurt several others.L.Monzali. Antonio Tacconi e la comunit√† italiana di Spalato p.137 A civilian in the crowd, Matej Mi≈°, was shot and killed, and Captain Gulli was also hit by a shot, dying the next day. In Italy the reaction to what happened in Split was indignation, while in the city of Trieste (another former Austro-Hungarian annexed by Italy) Italian proto-fascists and nationalists destroyed the Trieste National Hall (Narodni dom), the center of the Slovene theatre in Trieste and other activities.

Velu (Sri), a teenager, works in a roadside shop. He meets Jyothi (Urmila Mahanta), who is a maidservant at a few of the nearby apartments. Velu falls in love with Jyothi. Aarthy (Manisha Yadav) lives in one of the apartment buildings. Dinesh (Mithun Murali) is a student who resides in the same building. Dinesh is a spoilt brat. As luck would have it, Aarthy falls for him without knowing his true intentions. Dinesh too is attracted to Aarthy. He seizes the opportunity and shoots video clips of her private moments on his mobile phone and even circulates them among his friends via MMS. When Aarthy finds out, she is aghast and threatens to approach the police. An angry Dinesh plans to ruin Aarthy's life by engaging in an acid attack but Jyothi accidentally intervenes and thus, sustains serious injuries in the process. The movie picks up speed as the corrupt Police Inspector Kumaravel (Muthuraman) begins investigations. Kumaravel negotiates with Dinesh's mother, who is a school correspondent but refuses later, due to her stubborn character and completes the investigation with Dinesh as the culprit of the murder attempt. But, Dinesh's mother approaches the minister with whom she's having an affair and asks him to intervene. The Minister and Kumaravel negotiate, finally agreeing upon for an amount of ten lakh rupees to be paid to the latter by the former for the release of Dinesh from the investigation. Kumaravel then backmails Velu into standing in the shoes of the accused in front of the court, if he wants to cure Jyothi. Velu accepts and is sentenced for several years in prison. Kumaravel, with the money he received, completes the construction of his house and gives nothing to Jyothi, unlike what he had promised. Later, Jyothi gets to know that Velu did not commit the crime and is falsely accused in order for her to be cured. She realises that Kumaravel has cheated her and Velu. Angry, she gets to the court and throws acid on Kumaravel. Jyothi is immediately arrested and as enquiries run course, the Judiciary finds Velu innocent and releases him. Dinesh is arrested and Jyothi is sentenced for years in prison for the crime she did. In the final scene, Velu meets Jyothi in prison and proposes his love and tells her that he will be waiting for her. As he leaves the cell, the door closes with the disfigured face of Jyothi shown on screen.

He was working on the scriptment for over 15 months and finished the entire script by early 2010. Sakthivel said that he had completed the middle portion and the climax part of the film but was unsure about how to start the film, taking over one year to finalize on the opening sequences, which he worked on with Linguswamy. He disclosed that the film would focus on relationships and \\"so-called love\\" of today's generation, set in a city, describing it as a \\"teenage thriller\\". He further informed that the climax was inspired from a news report. Sakthivel decided to cast new faces in the lead and most of the character roles as well, with early reports claiming that Naveen Rai and Prajna were being introduced in the lead roles. In May 2010, it was reported that the director had done a screen test and test shoots with the son of senior communist leader and progressive writer C. Mahendran. Only after the completion of filming, Sakthivel revealed the final cast; Mithun Murali, who has appeared in three Malayalam before, and Sri, who has been part of the television serial Kana Kaanum Kaalangal that was aired on Vijay TV, played the male leads, while the lead female characters were played by Urmila Mahanta, a student of the Pune Film Institute, hailing from Assam, and Manisha Yadav, a model from Bangalore. Filming was supposed to commence in early March 2010, but eventually started in August 2010, with shootings held in and around Dharmapuri. Cinematographer Vijay Milton used a Canon EOS 7D digital camera for the filming. Noted guitarist R. Prasanna, who Sakthivel was supposed to work with in his previous venture Kalloori, was chosen to compose the film's soundtrack and background score, replacing his usual associate Joshua Sridhar. The composer was chosen only after the filming was completed. Soundtrack The soundtrack album and background score was composed by noted guitarist R. Prasanna, making his debut as a feature film composer. The album features three tracks, with two songs named as \\"Oru Kural\\" and \\"Vaanathai\\", in which for the former had lyrics written by Na. Muthukumar and sung by Karthik, with the latter was penned and sung by Kadhal Dhandapani, and an instrumental theme music. The songs, excluding the theme music, were recorded through acapella versions, in which the songs will not feature, a background music or any instruments. For the theme music, Prasanna collaborated with several international musicians, including Argentinian singer Sofia Tosello, Venezuelan cuatro player Juancho Herrera, American pianist Victor Gould, Argentinian bassist Andres Rotmistrovsky and Hungarian drummer Ferenc Nemeth along with Indian flautist Kamalakar to create a mix of various genres. The album was released on 4 April 2012, in an audio launch event and subsequently premiered on an FM Radio Station. Release The satellite rights of the film were secured by STAR Vijay. The film was given a \\"U/A\\" certificate by the Indian Censor Board. Vazhakku En 18/9, was initially slated to release on 27 April 2012, however the success of Udhayanidhi Stalin's Oru Kal Oru Kannadi, made its release postponed to 4 May 2012. Reception Vazhakku Enn 18/9 received high critical acclaim upon release. The Times of India gave it 4.5 out of 5, the highest rating ever for a Tamil film since its inception in April 2008, with its reviewer M. Suganth calling the film a \\"bravura piece of filmmaking that will leave you stunned - and even invigorated - by the time it ends\\". Rediff's Pavithra Srinivasan gave the film 3.5 out of 5, citing that Vazhakku En 18/9 was \\"hard-hitting\\" and a \\"must-watch\\". Sify's critic labelled the film as \\"excellent\\" and commented that it was \\"refreshing, captivating and engrossing\\". Rohit Ramachandran of Nowrunning.com rated it 3.5/5 stating that Vazhakku Enn 18/9 was a \\"rewarding piece of cinema that establishes Balaji Sakthivel as a film-maker to look out for\\". Malathi Rangarajan from The Hindu wrote: \\"The acumen of the ace story teller comes to the fore yet again in Vazhakku Enn: 18/9. A neat presentation with an all new-cast could have been a tough proposition. But Sakthivel achieves it with √©lan\\", concluding that the film was \\"another product Sakthivel can be proud of\\". Indiaglitz.com stated that it had \\"moments that leave a lump in your throat\\", further writing that it \\"needs a man with conviction like Balaji Shakthivel to come up with such a convincing film\\", while calling it a \\"splendid show\\". Romal M. Singh from Daily News & Analysis wrote: \\"Simply put, Vazhakku Enn 18/9 is the much-sought after cinematic ‚Äòvoice‚Äô, representing the world we live in ‚Äî as is ‚Äî no glamourising, no touch-ups and definitely no un-needed glorifying\\". Vishnupriya Bhandaram of The Hindu in her review of the Telugu version Premalo Padithe said: \\"What is perhaps beautiful about the story is that it is an amalgamation of two levels in society ‚Äî the high, mighty and rich and the poor\\". She further continued: \\"With a heavy heart and a mind ridden with hard truths, take away what you can: a semblance of love in a promise to wait a lifetime for a half-burnt face\\".

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 8, 2011. This episode mainly centers around the couple of Stan and Francine, whom become divided over the architectural style wanted for the renovation of their kitchen. Greg and Terry, the Smiths' gay neighbors, intervene in the situation. Greg and Terry criticize the strength of Stan and Francine's marriage, much to their frustration. A bet is made in regard to the Smiths' rocky relationship: if Terry and Greg were to win the bet, they would receive the marriage license of Stan and Francine. Meanwhile, Steve, his friends, and Principal Lewis take advantage of Barry's proficient ability to count cards; however things become awry when they try to remove Lewis of his cut. This episode was written by Alan Freedland and Alan R. Cohen, and directed by Joe Daniello. It was met with mixed reception from television critics, who went on to criticize the episode's humor. During its initial airing, the episode was viewed by 3.29 million households and achieved a 1.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielsen ratings. It featured a guest appearance from Maurice LaMarche, as well as several recurring voice actors and actresses for the series. Plot After Hayley is hit in the forehead with a plate from the cabinet, she and Jeff start arguing over their new checks. Stan admonishes Jeff and Hayley about their bickering and points out Stan and Francine's romantic harmony. Hearing from Roger that Greg and Terry just remodeled their kitchen, Hayley, Jeff, Stan and Francine head over to take a look. Admiring the new kitchen, they consider their own remodel but Greg and Terry tell them their marriage could not handle the strain. Stan takes up the challenge; if they can remodel without breaking up, Greg and Terry will pay for the remodel. If they fail, Greg and Terry get the Smiths' marriage license. Stan and Francine have a minor disagreement when they both choose white for the new color but pick different shades, but things start to fall about when Francine wants a modern kitchen while Stan wants a traditional one. With Greg and Terry present, Stan overrides Francine with the contractor, insisting on his kitchen choice. Francine retaliates by asking the contractor to put a bay window in the kitchen. When Stan finds out, they start to bicker but when they notice Greg and Terry watching pretend that everything is still fine. As the remodel spreads through the house, Stan and Francine's marital harmony breaks down until they finally divide the house in two, each decorating in their chosen style. Not satisfied, they each attempt to drive the other out of the house until they erect a block wall between the two halves of the house, inside and out. As the rest of the family spends one holiday after another with first Francine, then Stan (celebrating several holidays in a single week in their attempts to make each other feel bad), they leave the other alone and miserable. After several days of being alone, they hear each other across the wall and cannot bear to be apart any longer. They tear down the wall and agree to return the house the way it used to be, despite the removal of the wall causing the rest of the house to collapse. Meanwhile, at Pearl Bailey High School, when Principal Lewis knocks a box of candy out of Barry's hands, Barry is quickly able to determine what was lost. Deciding to test Barry, Principal Lewis runs through a deck of cards and Barry is successful in determining the remaining cards. Principal Lewis takes the boys out to a gambling house where he turns Barry loose at the blackjack table where he quickly wins big. But when Principal Lewis leaves them stuck in the car while he goes to a strip club with the winnings, the boys decide to strike out on their own. They are successful until Principal Lewis finds them and threatens to sell them out, exposing Principal Lewis who owes the casino money. Lewis blurts that the kids were counting cards and the casino owner orders that they all be shot. Fleeing the casino's goons, they hide behind a trash can until the goons empty their weapons. Barry betrays Principal Lewis by claiming the goons are out of ammunition when one of them has a single bullet left. Principal Lewis bursts out in confidence but is shot in the shoulder as the goons leave. Barry then jams his finger into Principal Lewis' bullet wound as part of his revenge. Production and development \\"Home Wrecker\\" was originally intended to air as the eighteenth episode of the sixth season of American Dad!, airing a week after the third part of a fictional crossover event between American Dad!, The Cleveland Show, and Family Guy. However just two days before its planned airing, it was announced by the executive of the entertainment division of the Fox Broadcasting Company that the event was pushed back until next season, due to a series of tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the Southern United States. In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Maurice LaMarche guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actors Curtis Armstrong, Daisuke Suzuki and Eddie Kaye Thomas guest starred as Steve's friends in the episode, while Kevin Michael Richardson would return to play his part as Principal Lewis. Jeff Fischer returns to resume his role as Hayley's husband while writer Mike Barker would return to play his part as Terry Bates. In addition to his roles of Stan and Roger, series creator Seth MacFarlane reprised his role of Greg Corbin. Armstrong, Suzuki, Thomas, Fischer, and Richardson previously reprised their roles in the season six episode \\"Jenny Fromdabloc\\", while Barker previously reprised his role in the season six episode \\"The People vs. Martin Sugar\\". Cultural references The 1978 musical film Grease, which starred Olivia Newton-John (left) and John Travolta (right), was parodied in the episode \\"Home Wrecker\\" contains several references relating to music, media, film, and other pop culture phenomenon. The musical number that was performed by the Smith family is a parody to the performance of the song \\"We Go Together\\" in the 1978 musical film, Grease. Francine and Stan closely resembled Sandy Olsson and Danny Zuko, whom were played by Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta, respectively. The episode's subplot is a parodical combination of the 1988 comedy film Rain Man and the 2008 drama film 21. The British film director and producer Alfred Hitchcock was referenced in the episode, in which he can be seen at the strip club where Principal Lewis goes to as a silhouette. This episode satirizes several stereotypes in regard to the homosexual community, particularly among gay men. Among these stereotypes include, their love for musicals, their love for redecorating and their love for the finer things in life (Terry's reference to olives at Mediterranean temperature). The scene in which Stan and Francine divides the house to fit their needs is similar to the style of that seen in the television sitcom The Brady Bunch. Several songs were satirized and parodied in the episode. Toshi sings in English when singing with Steve, Snot, and Barry \\"Yah Mo B There\\". The music that binds Fran and Stan sounds like Barry Mann's \\"Who Put The Bomp\\". Reception \\"Home Wrecker\\" first aired on May 8, 2011 in the United States as part of the animated television night on Fox. Like with much of the latter half of the season, the episode was first in the animation television line-up. It was succeeded by episodes of The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, and its sister shows Family Guy and The Cleveland Show. It was viewed by over 3.29 million viewers, despite airing simultaneously with 60 Minutes on CBS, Dateline on NBC, and America's Funniest Home Videos on ABC. The total viewership of \\"Home Wrecker\\" was the lowest of the season, and it also became the lowest rated episode in the series' history. It garnered a 1.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielsen ratings. The total viewership and ratings for the episode were significantly down from the previous episode, \\"Jenny Fromdabloc\\", which was viewed by 4.74 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic. Television critics were polarized with the episode. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club was impartial on the episode, ultimately giving it a 'C+' grade. This would be the second lowest grade of the night: \\"Home Wrecker\\" went on to score higher than The Simpsons episode \\"Homer Scissorhands\\" but score lower than Family Guy episode \\"The Big Bang Theory\\", the Bob's Burgers episode \\"Weekend at Mort's\\", and The Cleveland Show episode \\"Your Show of Shows\\". Kaiser called it \\"a [fucking] weird episode of American Dad\\". He expressed discontentment for the episode's humor, saying that there was an excessive tendency to use meta-jokes. Kaiser also felt that the episode was over-saturated with humor. More criticism stemmed into the show's use of Roger in the episode, as he wrote: \\"Roger is sadly generally lacking [...] as is the manic pacing of most American Dad episodes. I like that they try weird random [shit], but I don't think it really succeeded here.\\" In his review for \\"Home Wrecker\\", Rowan Kaiser concluded that the episode \\"wasn't a total waste\\". He continued: \\"There are some good bits, most notable a montage as Francine and Stan celebrate various holidays apart from one another over the course of a week.\\" References  External links  2011 American television episodes American Dad!

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 15, 2011, and is written by Keith Heisler and directed by Pam Cooke. In the episode, Francine begins working at the CIA office with Stan, which makes Stan uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Steve and Roger build birdhouses for cash. Plot During the apparent filming of a Dutch documentary, Deputy Director Bullock is forced to promote one of the office workers Lorraine and hires Francine as a replacement. Francine soon finds out that the entire office flirts with each other and soon gets into the spirit of things. Stan is less enthused as he is very popular with the office ladies due to his muscular buttocks and is forced to restrain himself in front of Francine. When Francine finds out she tells him he can relax and continue his flirtations but when Stan sees the others in the office flirting back with Francine he starts to have reservations. When Lorraine finds that the guys are no longer interested in her she becomes angry. Eating lunch with a depressed Stan, they both commiserate over how they need to get Francine out of the office. But as Bullock finds his partially eaten sandwich in Francine's desk that had been planted by Stan, Lorraine throws acid in Francine's face, disfiguring her horribly. After being told that it could take years for a skin donation to become available, Stan confesses to Francine that he only intended her to be fired and Francine kicks him out of her hospital room. Francine returns to work to everyone's horror. Desperate to find someone to pay attention to Francine, Stan threatens to shoot Dick in the crotch but he ended up taking the bullet rather than face Francine. Stan then turns to Butch Johnson who confesses to being a Chinese spy rather than face Francine, although he fails to notice the Dutch film crew are also Chinese spies. Chatting with the \\"film crew\\", they suggest he should pay more attention to Francine himself. Stan agrees and feels much better, to which Butch asks Stan if he's in trouble for being a chinese spy and Stan says yes and shoots Butch, killing him. When he goes home, Francine is resistant to his flirting at first as it feels like it shouldn't count because they're married, but soon warms up to the idea. As they embrace and Francine calls him by his office nickname \\"Thunderbutt\\", Stan hits on the idea of having some of his skin and muscles removed from his buttocks to be transplanted into Francine's face, restoring her looks. Meanwhile, Roger sees Steve building a birdhouse and talks him into starting a birdhouse building business. When the orders start rolling in Steve asks Roger to buy more supplies. But when Roger buys cheap supplies to pocket the cash difference for drugs and girls, resulting in the death of a family of birds, Steve breaks up their partnership. Roger later arrives and claims to have cleaned up his act. As they bid each other farewell, Steve gives a voice over monologue that he knew Roger was faking it and within minutes he died of a drug overdose, the camera pulling back to show Roger on the kitchen floor. Reception The episode received mixed reviews. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, saying \\"This episode is remarkably resistant to criticism. In some respects, its reliance on horrific violence and awkward humor make it seem more like Family Guy than American Dad at its best. A conversation between Steve and an apparently-clean Roger that seems like a reference to a movie just outside of my memory exemplifies this ‚Äì it's awkward, but it's a reference, so it's okay? I'm not sure about this episode of American Dad, but I know what I hate, and I didn't hate that.\\" Dyanamaria Leifsson of TV Equals gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"I did love Stan‚Äôs thunder-butt thunderclap and I thought the ending was pretty cute with Francine calling Stan \\"Crater Butt\\" and Stan calling her \\"Ass Face\\" ‚Äì thank goodness they‚Äôve got such a great plastic surgeon in town. Although American Dad normally has a twisted sense of humor, this episode was much darker than I normally expect. If you‚Äôre the kind of American Dad fan that loves when the humor gets really depraved, this episode is bound to be among your favorites. I just hope I‚Äôll be able to forget Francine‚Äôs scabby melted face or it will be hard for me to look at her the same way ever again.\\" The episode was watched by a total of 3.89 million people, this made it the fifth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to Bob's Burgers, The Cleveland Show, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 6.55 million.

After finishing elementary school at the age of 10, Toma≈°iƒá moved to Canada where she finished high school and a police college. As a police officer, she worked on the prevention of juvenile delinquency and combatting drug trafficking. After Croatian president Franjo Tuƒëman invited her to return to Croatia in 1990, Toma≈°iƒá accepted and started working as a member of Tuƒëman's personal security. After beating ovarian cancer, she decided to leave police work and engage in politics. From 2003 to 2008 she was a member of the Croatian Parliament elected from the list of the Croatian Party of Rights and from December 2011 to July 2013 as an MP for the Croatian Party of Rights Dr. Ante Starƒçeviƒá. At the 2013 and 2014 EP elections, Toma≈°iƒá won second most preference votes of all the candidates, and at the 2019 EP elections, most preference votes. On 17 January 2015 she joined the newly founded Croatian Conservative Party. In the European Parliament, Toma≈°iƒá sits in the European Conservatives and Reformists group. As of 2019, the European Parliament adopted 5 of her reports, 28 reports on which she worked as a shadow rapporteur, 573 of her amendments and 293 resolutions which, in addition to delivering more than 1000 speeches and sending 146 parliamentary questions to the EU Commission and the Council, made her the most active Croatian MEP. Early life Ru≈æa Toma≈°iƒá was born in the village of Mlado≈°evica, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina,and grew up with her parents, six sisters and a brother in the Slavonian village of Velika Kopanica. At age 15, she left Croatia and joined her older sister, who was married and lived in Toronto, Canada. Toma≈°iƒá worked on a variety of jobs to support herself before enrolling in 13-week program at Ontario Police College, from which she graduated in 1981. In her career as a police officer in Toronto and Vancouver, she primarily dealt with juvenile delinquency and illegal drug trade, which included undercover work. Return to Croatia In September 1990, Toma≈°iƒá moved to Croatia, by invitation from then-President Franjo Tuƒëman who met her during his state visit to Canada, and served as a bodyguard for top Croatian government officials. In 1992, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer, and chose to go back to Canada for medical treatment. After recovering completely from her illness in 1998 she decided to move to Croatia again. In the meantime, Toma≈°iƒá appeared in approximately 20 episodes of The X-Files and Millennium as a stuntwoman, drawing on her experience of riding a police motorcycle in the mid-1980s. Politics and activism Toma≈°iƒá was politically active in the Croatian Canadian community, and became a member of the nationalist Croatian Party of Rights in 1990. After settling in Croatia with her family in 1998, she began a more earnest involvement in politics, became a vice-president of the Croatian Party of Rights, and entered the 2003 election in the top spot on her party's list in the 10th electoral unit, which brought her a seat in Sabor. Her term ended in January 2008. In 2009 Toma≈°iƒá left the Croatian Party of Rights over disagreements with its president Anto ƒêapiƒá. She accused ƒêapiƒá of \\"betraying the party\\" and of using his position for personal gain. In September 2009 she was elected president of a new party, Croatian Party of Rights Dr. Ante Starƒçeviƒá. Known as an anti-drug activist, she reportedly received a number of death threats in 2006. In 2007 it was reported that organized crime groups had been allegedly planning her assassination. By that time, she had started carrying a pistol for self-defense, and her family received police protection. In December 2010 Toma≈°iƒá received the Order of Stjepan Radiƒá in recognition of her efforts fighting organized crime. In March 2013, she made headlines after she was quoted saying \\"Croatia is for Croats while everyone else is a guest\\", a claim she disputed. On 3 November 2014 Toma≈°iƒá left the Croatian Party of Rights Dr. Ante Starƒçeviƒá. =Member of European Parliament= In the European election of 14 April 2013, Toma≈°iƒá was elected in the European Parliament, placing 6th in the candidates list of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). On 1 July 2013, after Croatia joined the European Union, she took office as Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Toma≈°iƒá joined European Conservatives and Reformists Group and became member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and Special Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering. She was re-elected MEP following European election of 25 May 2014, serving her second term in office, placing 5th in the candidates list of HDZ. Controversies Commenting on the statement by Serbian Labour Minister Aleksandar Vulin, who said Croatia cannot give lessons to Serbia about war crimes after Croatia's Interior Minister Ranko Ostojiƒá said that Serbia could improve its path to join the European Union by holding a trial for the murder of twelve Croatian police officers in Borovo Selo during the Croatian War of Independence, Toma≈°iƒá stated: \\"Let them [Serbs] pray to God that we do not clean up our yard because if we start to clean our yard you will have a lot more Serbs from Croatia who will have to go to Serbia. They hold this state for their treasury and supermarket and give nothing to the state\\". Her statement was criticised by many, including the Committee on Human Rights and National Minorities of the Croatian Parliament. Three days later, Toma≈°iƒá wrote on her official Facebook page that she was referring to those Serbs who committed war crimes during the 1990s Croatian War of Independence and were never tried. Personal life Toma≈°iƒá lives in Brna, on the island of Korƒçula, which is the birthplace of her husband Vlado, whom she married in 1987. They have two children. She is a practising Roman Catholic and declares her adherence to traditional Christian values.

Background The awards have been presented annually since 2002 by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service to celebrate excellence in the U.S. federal civil service, and are named for Samuel J. Heyman, the organization's founder. To date, over 120 individuals and teams have been recognized. Selection process The Sammies are chosen from nominations collected each winter, and narrowed down to about 30 finalists announced mid-spring of each year during Public Service Recognition Week. The finalists are assessed, and from their ranks, eight awardees are selected by early fall. The Sammies selection committee is composed of nationally known journalists, political leaders, educators, and executives of large corporations. The eight awards cover the various sectors of federal public service. Honorees are chosen for their commitment and innovation, as well as the impact of their work on addressing the needs of the republic. Awardees are announced each fall at a dinner and awards ceremony in Washington, D.C. The Sammies finalists are those federal employees confronting complex issues of governance, including environmental, national security, and economic challenges. One criterion of the award is to qualify from among a dynamic group of talented, bright individuals working on behalf of the American people.

It is most famous for being the battlefield for Skanderbeg's first battle against the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Torvioll which took place on 29 June 1444. According to a defter gathered by the Ottomans in 1467, the region of Lower Dibra included the northern half of Dibran territory.Frash√´ri, Kristo (2002) (in Albanian), Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu: jeta dhe vepra, p. 139. The plain, according to Giammaria Biemmi's work, one of the primary sources on Skanderbeg and his campaigns, was long and wide, stretching from Mount Maran in Lower Dibra to the Mokra Mountains. He also says that it is closed by a series of hills at whose feet runs the Shkumbin River and two heavily-wooded mountains where Skanderbeg hid his ambushing force. However, the Shkumbin River does not run through Lower Dibra.Frash√´ri, Kristo (2002) (in Albanian), Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu: jeta dhe vepra, p. 140. Instead, the Black Drin does. Kristo Frash√´ri, an eminent historian on the study of Skanderbeg, states that Biemmi lapsed, confusing the Black Drin with the Shkumbin. Furthermore, the Black Drin matches all of the geographical features described by Biemmi, as does the modern-day Plain of Shumbat. Biemmi furthermore states that the plain derived its name from a nearby village. It is not sure if this village actually existed, but it is assumed that Torvioll lends its etymology to the word tevioll in the Dib√´r dialect meaning land without a lord, noting that it did not have any owners and any shepherd could feed his livestock there. It is therefore possible that the battle was originally named after Tevioll and was corrupted to Torvioll.Frash√´ri, Kristo (2002) (in Albanian), Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu: jeta dhe vepra, p. 141.

Her parents hosted numerous guests, ranging from visiting academics to exchange students, that gave Berie \\"a tin ear for languages\\" and made it difficult for her to understand \\"foreignness, code, mood\\". Berie and Sils made friends with their co-workers at Storyland and saved frogs from teenage boys until Sils began dating Mike, a local boy with a motorcycle. Mike dominated Sils' time, leaving Berie out and confused by her absence. When Sils became pregnant, Berie stole money from the Storyland register to pay for an abortion. In between recollections of Horsehearts, Berie details her troubles with Daniel, her husband. Recently, they fought and he pushed her down the stairs of their apartment, resulting in a damaged hip. Daniel is distant from Berie, and she seeks companionship from friends like Marguerite, a Parisian artist, but is ultimately unable to recreate the closeness of her relationship with Sils. After Sils' abortion, Berie noticed her manager watching her at odd times. An accident on a ride in the park temporarily forestalled exposure, but she was eventually caught and fired. Baptized by Reverend Filo at a summer camp, she explored organized religion before finally getting her period late in adolescence. Sent to a boarding school, she achieved academic success and was astonished by her own physical development. Berie and Sils later met at a high school reunion but found that their relationship changed as they face middle age. Berie pays a last visit to LaRoue, who later commits suicide after being institutionalized for years, and the novel ends as Berie settles for comfortable distance from Daniel and her past.

It was built to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Canadian confederation and was to be named The Diamond Jubilee of Confederation Gates. The structure's name was changed when it was learned that Edward, Prince of Wales and Prince George were travelling to Toronto. The princes cut the ribbon on the structure on August 30, 1927. Design The Goddess of Winged Victory atop the central arch of the gate. The triumphal arch was designed in a neoclassical style by Chapman and Oxley, a Toronto- based architectural firm. The gates are made of a mix of stone and concrete, and the statue was poured concrete and weighed 12-tons. Above the arch are the words \\"Canadian National Exhibition 1879 1927\\". The end of the gate structure features two water fountains and above them the coat of arms of Ontario. The gates are a -long, 18-column structure with a -high central arch, topped by the Goddess of Winged Victory statue, an interpretation of the original Winged Victory of Samothrace, designed by architect Alfred Chapman of Chapman and Oxley and carved by Charles McKechnie. In her hand she holds a single maple leaf. Flanking the Winged Victory statue are various figures representing progress, industry, agriculture, arts, and science. There are nine pillars to either side of the main arch, representing the nine Canadian provinces in existence at the time of construction. Each column is topped with a flag pole. The plaza has an additional, taller flag pole, to the north of the central arch. The Princes' Gates image has been adopted by the Canadian National Exhibition Association (CNEA) as an official mark. The CNEA objected when a casino proposal used an image of the gates in their promotion materials. History Original architectural model of Princes' Gate, 1926. The Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) Exhibition Grounds, which was situated further to the west, was slowly growing eastward. Permanent buildings were being built further and further to the east, including the Coliseum, the Electrical and Engineering Building and the Automotive Building. The only gate to the exhibition was the Dufferin Gates at the west end of the grounds, although entry was possible by Strachan Avenue which turned west just south of the railway lines and continued west to the grounds. The CNE decided to build a new eastern gate to the grounds as a project to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of Canadian Confederation. The Princes' Gates were built in four months by the Sullivan and Fried Company of Toronto. The gates were officially opened by Princes Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII), and George (later the Duke of Kent), on August 30, 1927, during that year's CNE. The gates were originally to be called The Diamond Jubilee of Confederation Gates. Just 25 days before, the CNE changed the name when it was learned that a tour of Canada by the Princes was taking place. On the date of opening, the first to pass through the gate were 15,000 veterans in the annual Warriors' Day veterans' parade. At the same time, Strachan Avenue was extended south to the front of the Gates. Princes' Boulevard was built inside the grounds along an east-west axis starting at the Gates. At the time of construction, the Lake Ontario shoreline was just south of the Princes' Gates. Coronation Park would be constructed to the south and south-east in the 1930s. On August 25, 1928, the ceremonial plaque commemorating the Princes' unveiling was installed on the structure. On the Gates' 50th anniversary, a historical plaque was unveiled by W. B. Sullivan, one of the original builders. The official ribbon cutting of the Princes' Gates During 1986 and 1987, the Princes' Gates underwent a major restoration. In the fall of 1986, the Winged Victory statue was taken down and found to be seriously deteriorating. It was subsequently replaced by a glass-reinforced polymer plastic copy in 1987 to withstand the elements for over a century. That same year the gates officially became a listed building under the Ontario Heritage Act. In 2006, the piazza around the base of the arch was renovated at the cost of 2 million. It added landscaped gardens, new paving stones, new sidewalk and bike lanes. It was a joint effort with Italian design firms of Milan, which is Toronto's twin city and where Toronto firms had worked previously on piazzas there. In 2010, as part of a project of restorations and improvements of several buildings at the CNE, the Princes' Gates underwent further restorations to its masonry. The restoration was funded by the Government of Canada.

While there he served as chief of the Infectious Diseases Division, director of the Diagnostic Microbiology Laboratory, and vice-chairman of the Department of Medicine. In 1970, following his presentation at Grand Rounds on newer antibiotics, Sanford conceived the idea that doctors everywhere needed a practical guide to antibiotic use. He then led his fellows and faculty in a brain storming session on what should be included in this guide. The result was The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy.Sanford Guide- Retrieved 2017-01-24 Over the years Sanford and his family published the Guide, which is in its 45th edition and used by health care professionals worldwide. His expertise in infectious diseases and his leadership skills brought him to the forefront of many national organizations. Sanford served as councilor, secretary and then president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (1966 to 1979.) He also served as chairman of the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education, chairman of the American Board of Internal Medicine, and chairman of the ABIM's Subspecialty Committee on Infectious Diseases.

Hosted on Chortle.co.uk and accessible via iTunes, and RSS the show started in 2009 as a spiritual sequel to the Ray Peacock Podcast. A live show spawned from the podcast, the Peacock and Gamble Emergency Broadcast, which was performed at the Edinburgh Fringe as part of a tour. They also performed a live show in the winter of 2009, which has not been released for download. The podcast is well-acclaimed, having been nominated for numerous Chortle awards. Podcast history =The Ray Peacock Podcast= Ray Peacock (real name Ian Boldsworth) met Ed Gamble at a revue at Durham University. Their first podcast work together was the Ray Peacock Podcast, which was co-hosted with \\"Little Raji James who used to be in EastEnders but ruined it\\" - Peacock's actor friend, Raji James. Ed Gamble first joined the cast in episode 4 of the first series, and became a permanent host from series 2 onwards. Raji's role in the show was mainly as the butt of the jokes, with features such as \\"Raji's Autobiography\\" and \\"Letters for Raji\\" being written by Peacock and Gamble on his behalf, exaggerating traits such as his poor grammar and his floundering career. The Ray Peacock Podcast was successful, spawning live shows (attended by special guests such as Harry HillThe Ray Peacock Podcast - Episode 33 and The Office actor Ewen MacIntoshThe Ray Peacock Podcast - Episode 32), but ended after four series, as the presenters felt they were spending too much time making fun of Raji. Only forty-nine episodes of the Ray Peacock Podcast were recorded, in its original run, and only forty-eight of them were released. However, a final fiftieth show was recorded in September 2010, and released in conjunction with the fiftieth episode of Peacock and Gamble. =Peacock and Gamble Podcast= The first episode of the Peacock and Gamble Podcast was released in the spring of 2009, a brand new show following in the wake of The Ray Peacock Podcast. No longer presented by Raji James, the show was slightly more freeform than the previous podcast, with fewer recurring features - the humour being more autobiographical and anecdotal than its predecessor. The podcast was released weekly on Tuesdays, through Chortle.co.uk. The Peacock and Gamble Podcast featured more fan interaction than the Ray Peacock Podcast before it, with many features - such as \\"Fan of the Week\\" - being based around the show's official Facebook group, or since the website went live the Peacock and Gamble Forum. The show was devised in part by agent James Taylor, who suggested that Peacock and Gamble should establish an online presence in connection with a television show they were then writing.The Peacock and Gamble Podcast - Episode One. The television programme was occasionally mentioned in the show, which then progressed to the pilot stage. The pilot was shown to test audiences at the Peacock and Gamble Emergency Broadcast. Features / sections =Complaint Letters= The complaint letters feature was a double- headed feature produced by both presenters. The concept was that they would send complaint letters to big businesses in order to trick them into giving them free merchandise as compensation, the joke being that the complaints were incredibly unrealistic and often badly-written. The complaints would invariably report the mishaps befalling an eight-year-old boy Fraser, the letters written from the perspective of his mother, Mrs. Fraser. Although some details of the letters were inconsistent - with Mrs. Fraser's husband's backstory in particular changing from week to week - Fraser's maladies remained remarkably constant with ailments from previous weeks being insistently referenced. At the beginning of the show's run, Fraser was a perfectly healthy - if somewhat dim - child, but by the feature's end he was terminally ill and the character was officially killed off at the 2009 live shows. =Ed's Amazing Births= This feature, ostensibly a celebration of the miracle of birth, was hosted by Ed Gamble throughout much of 2010. Ed would research interesting births - usually urban legends or children with tragic deformities - and report them back to Peacock, who would usually criticise Gamble for believing some of the more ridiculous ones to be true, or for referring to some of the more tragic ones as \\"amazing.\\" Peacock would also bemoan Gamble's lack of research, and it eventually became apparent that Gamble tended to simply type non-sequiturs into Google and report back if he found any relevant results. This method did however often result in stories that were actually true, such as the one about a baby being born on a train in India and falling onto the tracks through the toilet. The presenters have claimed that Ed's Amazing Births is one of the most complained-about features, following an episode where Gamble failed to thoroughly research a story, which he read out without realising that the story was remorselessly tragic, if not harrowing. =Ed's Amazing Deaths= A sequel to Ed's Amazing Births, this feature was based around user generated content. Rather than using Google, Gamble appealed for users of the Peacock and Gamble Forum to recount deaths that had happened to their own families and friends. People did respond to the appeal,Peacock and Gamble Forum - Ed's Amazing Deaths but Peacock contended that many of the users were probably inventing deaths in order to get mentioned on the podcast. =Ray Says a Food (or Drink)= In early incarnations of the feature, Peacock would suggest a \\"forgotten food\\" that the listener may not have recently eaten, such as pickled eggs and beef jerky, in order to encourage them to eat it again. However, as the feature continued, the concept wandered a little. By episode 40, Peacock would embark upon a two- minute soliloquy, ranting about increasingly mundane foods and suggesting that the listener eat them in bizarre, improbable ways - imploring the listener, for instance, to travel to Egypt and eat a Cadbury Boost on a sphinx. For the last few episodes of the feature's run, the \\"foods\\" that Peacock suggested were no longer even edible - rather, he would ramble for two minutes, asking the listener to eat tractors or ghosts, or ambiguous concepts such as physics and religion. =Other features= Gamble ran a short-lived feature called \\"Ed's Film Pitches\\", whereby he would pitch pre-written film ideas to Peacock. These would generally be nonsensical in nature, but purport to deal with significant issues. One such pitch was Hangnail - a CGI film about hangnails. This led to a similar feature, currently running, in which Gamble attempts to summarise films that he either hasn't seen, or hasn't watched in a very long time. A recurring theme across both of these features is that he will usually cast Gabourey Sidibe in one of the roles, referring to her exclusively by the name \\"Precious from Precious.\\" This would usually be a role that she is entirely unsuitable for. Another, looser feature was dedicated to taking care of \\"business\\" - \\"Ray's Business Section\\" was mainly used to take care of general administration to do with the podcast, stemming both from the Facebook page and real life. This was composed of smaller sections, including \\"Fan of the Week\\" in which the two presenters would suggest names, and if someone with that name contacted them on Facebook they would be selected. This spawned \\"Fish of the Week\\" - a similar idea, seeking real people who had names relating to fish. Another subsection involved Peacock recounting a list of Facebook groups he'd joined in the past week. Another fan-based feature was PG Tips, in which Peacock and Gamble would deal out advice to problems sent in by listeners, regardless of their lack of credentials. Music The podcast uses music kindly donated by popular comedy-musicians the Tiger Lillies and Frank Sidebottom. The Tiger Lillies contributed \\"Gouge My Eyes Out\\", which is used as the show's theme tune, whereas \\"Vagina\\", \\"Maggots\\", and \\"Banging in the Nails\\" are used between sections. The closing theme is an instrumental version of Sidebottom's cover of The Smiths' \\"Panic\\". Sidebottom was a friend of the duo, and upon the occasion of his death, Peacock and Gamble dedicated a section of the podcast to the man's life, and ended the show with his cover of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Reception The Peacock and Gamble Podcast, while not broadly acknowledged by the mass media, has been praised by critics. Hazel Davis of The Guardian listed the podcast first in a run-down of the top 10 comedy podcasts, describing it as \\"35 minutes of pure gold.\\" It was nominated for a Chortle award in 2011.

TS King George V (the \\"KGV\\") was a pioneering Clyde passenger turbine steamer, built in 1926. She was a popular boat, seeing service to Inveraray and later based in Oban, and withdrawn in 1974. History View from tender in 1970, when anchored off Iona. King George V was built by William Denny and Brothers for the Turbine Steamers Ltd as a pioneering turbine powered vessel intended for longer routes. She passed to the ownership of David MacBrayne Ltd in October 1935, when plans to rename her were never enacted. Displaced by , she was withdrawn from service in 1974. Several attempts were made to preserve her as a floating pub or restaurant, but all failed. King George V was burnt out at Cardiff docks in 1981 and scrapped in 1984. View of capstan in 1970 off Staffa. Layout King George V was novel in design, providing spacious accommodation with an enclosed promenade deck, the saloon extending the full width of the hull and half the length of the vessel. Above this was an observation deck. The restaurant was aft on the main deck, with large observation windows. Her machinery was even more innovative. Seven turbines, with two very high pressure boilers, were linked by gears to twin propellers. The boilers had to be replaced after tubes burst. A first incident happened off Irvine at the end of the 1927 season, when two firemen were killed. A second incident was in Kilbrannan Sound, with no loss of life. She was re-boilered in 1929 and again 1935. In 1935, one turbine was removed to simplify the power system and two new, slightly broader funnels were fitted. A main mast was fitted in 1952, radar in 1958 and in 1959, inflatable life rafts replaced two of her lifeboats. She was further modernised in the winter refits of 1960 and 1961. Service King George V was initially mainly used on the Inveraray service but also visited Campbeltown. She became a much loved ship. After 1935, she was based in Oban cruising round Mull, to Iona, Staffa and Fort William. In World War II, she was requisitioned as a troop carrier, initially based at Southampton. In 1940, she evacuated troops from Rotterdam, Ostend, Calais, Boulogne and famously, Dunkirk, landing 4300 men at Dover. Returning to the Clyde in 1941 for tendering duties, she carried Prime Minister, Winston Churchill to his battleship en route to the Atlantic Conference. After the war, she resumed MacBrayne cruises on the Clyde in 1946, including the summer Ardrishaig mail service. She was back to Oban in 1947 and each summer until withdrawn in 1974. In her final years she also undertook charters, including one to Bangor in Ireland.

It was designed by Jewish-Croatian architect Hugo Ehrlich to serve needs of Zemun's Evangelical community at the time mostly consisted of Germans. Its plan is reminiscent of a trefoil, a rotunda with a prominent east apse and two side wings placed symmetrically in relation to the main entrance. A narrow narthex and the side wings are covered with hip roofs above which rises a larger-sized drum supporting a dome. The lantern mounted on top of the dome originally was surmounted by the cross, a symbol of Christ‚Äôs passion. The facades feature a reduced number of symmetrically arranged openings. The compact design, important attribute of the architectural school of Hugo Ehrlich and Viktor Kovaƒçiƒá, has townscape value that stems from the building‚Äôs successful positioning in relation to a crossroad on the approach to the Historic Core of Zemun. The Evangelical church shows an original, rarely employed and consistently modernist architectural design. After the end of World War II, all church activities ceased, building was nationalised and served as administrative office for a prolonged period of time in Socialist Yugoslavia. In this period many elements of church's original architecture were altered and cross on top of the dome replaced with five-pointed star, symbol of communism. Its misuse continued after the breakup of Yugoslavia when it served as a night club and gaming house. Finally in 2004. its historical and cultural value was officially recognised and church declared to be cultural monument under the protection of the state. In the same year Municipality of Zemun decided to return building to its original purpose - to serve Zemun's Evangelical community. However, at present time Evangelical community is no longer mostly consisted of Germans but of Slovaks. For that reason in 2006. additional agreement regarding jurisdiction was concluded between the German and that also received support from Evangelical Church in W√ºrttemberg. In November of 2006. first post-war deacon was appointed - Mgr. Vladislav Iviƒçiak.

This species is considered one of five known Lilium species native to specific sites in the United States' southeast region.LILIES and Related Plants In 1940, this species was discovered by Mary Henry in its habitat. She named the lily in reference to a \\"pot of gold at the end of the rainbow\\". Lilium iridollae is the most demanding of specific conditions, that is one reason why this lily has been elusive to many enthusiasts. In general, the southeastern region of the United States is not considered \\"lily growing country\\" since it has warm winter temperatures and high humidity which are not suitable conditions for garden lilies. Common names Lilium iridollae is more commonly known by these two names: pot-of-gold lily and panhandle lily. In Florida and Alabama, Lilium iridollae is referred by panhandle lily. In North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, Lilium iridollae is referred to as pot-of-gold lily.USDA Plants Profile Distribution Distribution of Lilium iridollae Lilium iridollae grows along streams in wet pine woodlands and in pitcher plant bogs in the southeastern United States.USBG: Lilium iridollae It is mainly found in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Virginia. This species has become endangered in Florida and threatened in North Carolina. The balance of the habitat of this endangered plant, Lilium iridollae, is reliant on episodic, naturally occurring fires caused by lightning strikes. The fires reduce competition from other plants and release nutrients and organic substance from burned peat moss and leaves into the acidic, nutrient-poor soil. Lilium iridollae‚Äôs sensitivity to changes in drainage patterns and water quality make them predominantly susceptible to disturbances in its ecosystem. For example, they might be overgrazed by livestock and urban development in nearby areas. Description The flower stalk may grow to be 6 feet tall, but more often they are a foot or two shorter. The individual flower stalks only create one solitary flower that hangs downward from the stem.Native Florida Wildflowers Each flower is about 3-4 inches wide. The colors of the flowers ranges from a pale yellow to a rich orange. The petals on the flower are recurved that causes them to touch each other over the back of the stem while the stamens and the stigma hang downward in the open space. In addition, the petals also have heavy brownish-black spots. The flowers are non-fragrant. Pollination Swallowtail butterfly (main pollinators of Lilium iridollae Lilium iridollae and many other related species are pollinated mostly by large swallowtail butterflies. In addition, this plant is also attractive to bees and/or birds. When pollination occurs, a large seed capsule ultimately develops that can contain many hundreds of seeds. How they grow Lilium iridollae are deciduous and they return to its bulb stage in late fall. Near early spring, brand new leaves form and they develop into a basal rosette immediately. In late spring, the basic rosette begins to elongate. Then by mid- to late-July they being to flower. Seed is light brown and delayed-hypogeal without stratification in 1‚Äì2 months. There are often situations where Native lilies neglect to flower if the conditions are not right. In that case, they might spend years appearing each spring as a basal rosette of leaves. In addition, young plants, in optimal conditions, take more than two years to develop into a flower from a seed because they mature at a slow pace. Similar or related rare species Lilium superbum in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina Lilium iridollae is closely related to Lilium superbum or referred by common names such as Turk‚Äôs Cap Lily, Turban Lily, Swamp lily or American Tiger Lily. Lilium superbum has dark orange, non-fragrant flowers with purple spots. It has leaves in 6 - 10 whorls on a 6 - foot stem.Florida Natural Areas Inventory Lilium michauxii Lilium michauxii or Carolina Lily is another species similar to Lilium iridollae. Lilium michauxii has flowers that resemble flowers of Turk‚Äôs Cap Lily, but the differences are that the flowers are fragrant and the stem is only 2 ‚Äì 3 feet tall. In addition, the leaves are broadly lance-shaped. Protection and management Since Lilium iridollae has become an endangered and threatened species there are ways to protect and manage them. One way is to protect streams from siltation or sedimentation during logging and road construction. In addition, avoid logging on slope forests. Furthermore, avoid draining and filling wetlands. Since wildfires benefit Lilium iridollae, we should avoid placing firebreaks in ecotones. The wildfires should be allowed to burn into edges of streamside forests. Lastly, eradicate feral hogs because they can be harmful.

He was investigated for potential violations of federal rules about conflict of interest after he arranged for Doug Hampton, Cynthia's husband and formerly a top staffer in his Washington, DC office, to gain a private lobbying job and apparently used his federal position to benefit Hampton's clients. Ensign resigned from the Senate in 2011 during a Senate Ethics Committee investigation and returned to Las Vegas, Nevada. The committee turned its report over to the Department of Justice for investigation of potential violation of laws. The DOJ found evidence of strong-arm tactics, but decided against prosecution of Ensign, according to internal federal documents released under a FOIA request in late 2014. Doug Hampton was prosecuted and reached a plea deal with the government in May 2012. Affair At the time of the affair, Cynthia Hampton worked for Ensign as treasurer of the Senate and Battle Born PAC (a conservative political action committee of which Ensign was the honorary chairman). She and her husband Douglas Hampton were close friends of Ensign and his wife; Doug worked as a top administrative aide in Senator Ensign's Capitol Hill office.Herszenhorn, David M., \\"Senator Ensign Admits Extramarital Affair\\", The New York Times Caucus blog, June 16, 2009, 6:24 pm EDT. Retrieved 6/16/09. When the affair was revealed by Doug Hampton in 2009, an Ensign spokesperson asserted that it had occurred between December 2007 and August 2008, but Hampton said that it began at Christmas 2006. Neither of the Hamptons worked for Ensign after May 2008.AP foreign, \\"Sen. Ensign admits affair with ex- campaign staffer\\", The Guardian, 16 June 2009, accessed 20 October 2015 Cynthia Hampton never spoke publicly about the affair. She testified to the Senate Ethics Committee in 2011 in its investigation.Laura Myers, \\"Ensign's former mistress speaks in ethics report\\", Las Vegas Review-Journal, 13 May 2011, accessed 20 October 2015 =Lobbying position for Douglas Hampton= In early 2008, Douglas Hampton confronted Ensign about the affair. Ensign contacted political and corporate supporters in Nevada, seeking work for Hampton. Within the next few months, Ensign arranged for Hampton to join a political consulting firm in Nevada and lined up several corporations who had been Ensign campaign donors as lobbying clients for Hampton. Under federal law senior aides such as Hampton are prohibited from lobbying the Senate for a year after leaving their posts. Hampton later said he and Ensign were aware of the lobbying restriction but chose to ignore it. Cynthia Hampton also lost her job with Ensign's PAC in May 2008. In 2008, after Hampton began working for the political consulting firm, Ensign and his staff repeatedly contacted federal agencies, often after requests from Hampton, on behalf of the companies that were Hampton's clients. In a statement published on October 1, the date that The New York Times reported on Ensign's arrangements for Douglas Hampton, Ensign said: \\"I am confident we fully complied with the relevant laws and rules governing current and past employees. I have worked on these Nevada issues with these Nevada companies for years, long before Doug Hampton left my office.\\" =Financial settlement= In April 2008, Ensign's parents gave Cynthia Hampton and her family $96,000. On July 9, 2009, when the payments were reported in the news, Ensign's lawyer, Paul Coggins, issued a statement on Ensign's behalf stating, \\"The payments were made as gifts, accepted as gifts and complied with tax rules governing gifts.\\" In late 2009, Doug Hampton disputed this interpretation, telling Nightline that it was \\"crystal clear\\" that the $96,000 was severance for him for leaving his job as staffer to Ensign and not a gift. Public scandal On June 11, 2009, Douglas Hampton sent a letter to Megyn Kelly, a Fox News reporter, in which he said, \\"The actions of Senator Ensign have ruined our lives and careers and left my family in shambles\\", and that \\"I need justice, help and restitution for what Senator Ensign has done to me and my family\\". The network said it did not receive a mailed letter, but got the letter as an e-mail attachment on June 15. In a statement on June 16, 2009, Ensign admitted that he had the affair. That day Ensign's wife Darlene issued a statement that said, in part, \\"Since we found out last year we have worked through the situation and we have come to a reconciliation.\\" On June 17, 2009, Ensign stepped down from his post as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, the fourth-ranking spot in the Republican Party's leadership. On June 19, the date that Douglas Hampton's June 11 letter to Fox News was made public, Ensign's office issued a statement, saying \\"within the past month, Doug Hampton's legal counsel made exorbitant demands for cash and other financial benefits on behalf of his client.\\" The Hamptons' attorney said that the couple was weighing how to respond to the Ensign statement. =Sen. Coburn intervenes= On July 8, the Las Vegas Sun reported that Douglas Hampton had spoken publicly for the first time about the affair. He said that Ensign and Cynthia Hampton continued the affair, although intermediaries, including Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, tried to persuade the senator to end it. Doug Hampton asserted that Coburn suggested that Ensign help the Hamptons pay off their home and move to Colorado. According to Douglas Hampton, in a meeting with Ensign arranged by Coburn, \\"Senator Coburn said, 'What I would do, Doug, if I was you, is I would have them buy your home, give you a million bucks so you can start over, and that is what I am willing to help you negotiate,'\\" he said. \\"John said, 'No can do, not going to happen.' [Coburn] volunteered to help. He called me. And he recommended a significant number as one that he would float to the Ensigns.\\" =Aftermath= According to Politico, Ensign became increasingly isolated after he admitted having an affair, with fellow Republican Senators keeping a distance. Both the Hamptons had been dismissed from their positions with Ensign before the affair was revealed. They later divorced. In September 2010, the Hamptons' home was scheduled for public auction. Douglas Hampton stated that he had been unable to find work since revealing the affair. In March 2011, Ensign said he would not seek re-election in 2012. He said his decision not to seek re-election was not influenced by the Senate Ethics Committee investigation. \\"If I was concerned about that, I would resign,\\" he said.Memoli, Michael A., Lisa Mascaro, and Ashley Powers. \\"Nevada GOP Sen.

In April 2011, three weeks before the committee delivered its findings, Ensign announced that he would resign his seat effective May 3, 2011. In May 2012, Doug Hampton reached a plea deal with prosecutors, the details of which have not yet been released.Steve Tetreault, \\"Doug Hampton reaches plea deal in illegal lobbying charges\\", Las Vegas Review-Journal, 15 May 2012, accessed 20 October 2015 In 2014, after the New York Times reported on internal Department of Justice considerations in the decision not to prosecute Ensign, Hampton expressed bitterness that he had lost so much and Ensign had not been punished for his actions. Investigations In January 2010, Politico reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating possible criminal violations in connection with the affair. It was reported in July 2010 that Senator Tom Coburn had assisted federal authorities in their investigation by turning over e-mails, seen as a sign that the official investigation is gathering steam. On November 10, 2010, the Federal Election Commission dismissed a complaint against Ensign over the $96,000 payment Ensign's parents made. In December 2010, the Department of Justice dropped its investigation.Fahrenthold, David A., \\"Justice Department stops investigating John Ensign, Washington Post, December 1, 2010 11:41 pm ET.

Cynthia Hampton has not commented on this. Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW, said to ABC that if true, the $96,000 unreported severance payoff for Douglas and Cynthia Hampton, Ensign's actions in aiding and abetting Hampton's violation of the one-year lobbying prohibition for ex- Senate staffers, or Ensign sexually harassing Cynthia Hampton, would amount to felonies.McFadden, Cynthia, Arons, Melinda & Sher, Lauren (November 23, 2009).\\"Exclusive: Doug Hampton Speaks Out on Sen.

Hours later Ensign said that his re-election campaign was increasing its fundraising efforts. According to Politico, senior Nevada Republicans and Republican Senate colleagues privately expressed concern that Ensign could cause them to lose his Senate seat. Senator Coburn was interviewed by the Ethics Committee in early March 2011. After investigating for twenty-two months, the Senate Ethics Committee concluded in May 2011 there was \\"substantial and credible evidence\\" that Ensign broke federal laws in his effort to cover up the extramarital affair. They referred the case to the Department of Justice and Federal Election Commission for further investigation. Their report said that Ensign may have violated laws related to \\"conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making false statements in attempting to cover up the affair and smooth over its aftermath.\\" =Renewed DOJ investigation= Sen.

These seven highways are sections of old alignments of MD 26, most of which are named Old Liberty Road, in the communities of Taylorsville, Winfield, and Eldersburg in southern Carroll County. There are also at least three former sections of MD 850: two are in Eldersburg and one is in Frederick. MD 26 was constructed west of Eldersburg between the early 1920s and early 1930s. That highway was extensively relocated and reconstructed across southern Carroll County in the late 1950s and early 1960s; many of the segments of Old Liberty Road became portions of MD 850. Route descriptions View east along MD 850E between Taylorsville and Winfield The two longest segments of MD 850 are MD 850H and MD 850J, which have lengths of and , respectively. MD 850H runs along the eastbound side of MD 26 from a dead end east of Winfield east to MD 26 in Eldersburg. The highway heads east as a two-lane undivided road and immediately intersects county-maintained Freter Road, which provides access to MD 26. The highway gradually veers away from the main highway. In the hamlet of Dorsey Crossroads, MD 850H meets MD 97 (Old Washington Road) at a roundabout a short distance south of MD 97's interchange with MD 26. A park and ride lot is located northwest of this roundabout. MD 850H continues east and gradually approaches the parallel MD 26. The state highway curves north and ends at MD 26's intersection with Klee Mill Road. MD 850J runs between two dead ends on the westbound side of MD 26 in Winfield. The highway begins at a dead end a short distance west of Salem Bottom Road. The state highway heads east as a two-lane undivided road and intersects county-maintained Salem Bottom Road, which provides access to MD 26. MD 850J starts to closely parallel MD 26; the two highways are connected by spurs on either side of South Carroll High School, east of which the state highway reaches its eastern terminus at a dead end. There are five other extant segments of MD 850. From west to east: *MD 850D is the designation for a pair of disjoint sections of Old Liberty Road on the eastbound side of MD 26 at the Frederick-Carroll county line near Taylorsville. The western segment runs from a dead end east to Buffalo Road, which follows the county boundary. The eastern segment runs from Roop Road east to a dead end. *MD 850C is the designation for a section of Old Liberty Road between two dead ends on the eastbound side of MD 26 between MD 850D and MD 27 in Taylorsville. The state highway is connected to MD 26 by county- maintained Franklinville Road. *MD 850E is the designation for a section of Old Liberty Road that follows the eastbound side of MD 26 from a dead end in Taylorsville east to an intersection with MD 26 just west of MD 850J's west end in Winfield. *MD 850I is the designation for a section of Old Liberty Road on the westbound side of MD 26 between MD 850J and MD 850H east of Winfield. MD 850I is connected to MD 26 by MD 26A. *MD 850K runs from MD 850H in Eldersburg, just south of the latter route's eastern terminus at MD 26, east to a dead end. History MD 850 comprises several segments of the old alignment of MD 26 from the Frederick-Carroll county line east to Eldersburg. MD 26 from Eldersburg toward Libertytown was built as a concrete road starting with the completion of the road from MD 32 to Dorsey Crossroads, the site of the MD 97 intersection, by 1923. The highway was extended through Winfield in 1924 and 1925. The concrete road was extended to just east of Taylorsville in 1928. The road to Taylorsville was completed in 1930. The final section of MD 26 between Baltimore and Frederick was completed from Taylorsville to west of the Carroll-Frederick county line in 1933. Modernization of MD 26 from the Frederick-Carroll County line to Eldersburg began in 1956 when the section from west of the county line to Taylorsville was placed under construction, including bypasses of MD 850C and MD 850D. In 1957, work began on relocating, widening, and resurfacing MD 26 through Eldersburg and between Taylorsville and Winfield, leading to the designation of MD 850E to the old section of the main highway west of Winfield. The final section of MD 26 in Carroll County to be placed in its modern form was from the western edge of Eldersurg to Winfield, which was completed in 1962 with a grade separation and interchange ramps at the MD 97 junction; Old Liberty Road in that area became MD 850H, MD 850I, and MD 850J. There have been several changes in the existing segments of MD 850 since they were designated. MD 850D was once a single segment that spanned two counties. The section of Old Liberty Road between the now-disjoint segments of MD 850D was transferred from state to private maintenance in 2001. In 2004, MD 850I was shortened from to its current length. MD 850H's roundabout at MD 97 was installed in 2005. MD 850K was assigned to what had been the eastern end of MD 850H in 2010 when MD 850H was rerouted to use a previously unnumbered spur to MD 26. There are at least three former sections of MD 850. MD 850F was the designation for a stretch of old alignment of MD 26 on the eastbound side of the state highway between MD 26 and a dead end adjacent to the main highway's intersection with Martz Road in Eldersburg. The state highway started as Emerald Lane, then turned east parallel to MD 26 and became Old Liberty Road. MD 850G was the designation for a section of Old Liberty Road between two dead ends on the westbound side of MD 26 in Eldersburg. The state highway was connected to MD 26 by county-maintained Linton Road. The eastern end of former MD 850G has been obliterated by new suburban development. MD 850F and MD 850G were created after the relocation of MD 26 through Eldersburg starting in 1957. The highways were removed from the state highway system in 2002. There are two other county-maintained segments of Old Liberty Road east of MD 32 in Eldersburg. One is along the eastbound side of MD 26 east of Carroll Highlands Road. The second is a spur on the westbound side of MD 26 at Oakland Mill Road between two arms of Liberty Reservoir just west of the Carroll-Baltimore county line. MD 850K was the designation for the section of Market Street between MD 355, which headed south as Market Street and north as Routzahn Way, and a partial intersection with MD 26 on the north side of Frederick. MD 850K was the original western end of MD 26 at U.S. Route 15 (US 15). The highway was paved as a macadam road by 1921. The highway was designated MD 31 in 1927 but became part of MD 26 in 1933. This segment was bypassed when MD 26 was extended west as a divided highway from Market Street to modern US 15 when the latter highway was completed in 1959. MD 850K was transferred from the state highway system to municipal maintenance in 2009 concurrent with MD 355 being truncated to south of Frederick.

Throughout this period, he was a specialist in military signals and a pioneer in the development of Radar. During the latter part of the First World War, Hart was a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps and RAF. Between the wars, Hart was a junior and middle-ranking officer in the RAF. Early life Hart was born in Merton, Surrey on 28 February 1899 and was educated at the Simon Langton School. First World War Hart joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1917 and was posted to the Western Front with 15 Squadron. On 11 April 1918 he was flying a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 two- seat biplane on a artillery observation patrol. Over Bouzincourt he was attacked by four German fighters, the elevator controls were damaged by gun fire and Hart attempted to recover the aircraft. His observer Second Lieutenant L.F. Handford managed to shoot three of the fighters down. The R.E.8 crashed and Hart and Handford were wounded. Both men were later awarded the Military Cross for the action. Royal Air Force Hart rejoined the Royal Air Force in 1926 and from 1936 he worked at RAF Bawdsey on the first experimental radar station. In 1941 he moved to the Air Ministry as Deputy Director of Radar before moving to Fighter Command as the Command Signals Officer. In 1944 Hart became Chief Air Signals Officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force whener he was involved in the planning for the D-Day landings. After the war he became Air Officer Commanding of No. 90 Group and from 1951 in the Air Ministry as Director General of Engineering and later Controller of Engineering and Equipment before he retired in 1959. Family life Hart was married and had one son. Hart died on 16 July 1960 at his home at Aston Rowant in Oxfordshire, he was electrocuted while connecting power to an electric lawn mower, he was aged 61.

The HPCC platform incorporates a software architecture implemented on commodity computing clusters to provide high-performance, data-parallel processing for applications utilizing big data. Handbook of Cloud Computing, \\"Data-Intensive Technologies for Cloud Computing,\\" by A.M. Middleton. Handbook of Cloud Computing. Springer, 2010. The HPCC platform includes system configurations to support both parallel batch data processing (Thor) and high-performance online query applications using indexed data files (Roxie). The HPCC platform also includes a data- centric declarative programming language for parallel data processing called ECL. Handbook of Data Intensive Computing, \\"ECL/HPCC: A Unified Approach to Big Data,\\" by A.M. Middleton. Handbook of Data Intensive Computing. Springer, 2011. The public release of HPCC was announced in 2011, after ten years of in- house development (according to LexisNexis). It is an alternative to Hadoop and other Big data platforms.  System architecture  Figure 2. Thor processing cluster The HPCC system architecture includes two distinct cluster processing environments Thor and Roxie, each of which can be optimized independently for its parallel data processing purpose. The first of these platforms is called Thor, a data refinery whose overall purpose is the general processing of massive volumes of raw data of any type for any purpose but typically used for data cleansing and hygiene, ETL (extract, transform, load) processing of the raw data, record linking and entity resolution, large-scale ad-hoc complex analytics, and creation of keyed data and indexes to support high-performance structured queries and data warehouse applications. The data refinery name Thor is a reference to the mythical Norse god of thunder with the large hammer symbolic of crushing large amounts of raw data into useful information. A Thor cluster is similar in its function, execution environment, filesystem, and capabilities to the Google and Hadoop MapReduce platforms. Figure 2 shows a representation of a physical Thor processing cluster which functions as a batch job execution engine for scalable data-intensive computing applications. In addition to the Thor master and slave nodes, additional auxiliary and common components are needed to implement a complete HPCC processing environment. Figure 3. Roxie processing cluster The second of the parallel data processing platforms is called Roxie and functions as a rapid data delivery engine. This platform is designed as an online high- performance structured query and analysis platform or data warehouse delivering the parallel data access processing requirements of online applications through Web services interfaces supporting thousands of simultaneous queries and users with sub-second response times. Roxie utilizes a distributed indexed filesystem to provide parallel processing of queries using an optimized execution environment and filesystem for high-performance online processing. A Roxie cluster is similar in its function and capabilities to ElasticSearch and Hadoop with HBase and Hive capabilities added, and provides for near real time predictable query latencies. Both Thor and Roxie clusters utilize the ECL programming language for implementing applications, increasing continuity and programmer productivity. Figure 3 shows a representation of a physical Roxie processing cluster which functions as an online query execution engine for high-performance query and data warehousing applications. A Roxie cluster includes multiple nodes with server and worker processes for processing queries; an additional auxiliary component called an ESP server which provides interfaces for external client access to the cluster; and additional common components which are shared with a Thor cluster in an HPCC environment. Although a Thor processing cluster can be implemented and used without a Roxie cluster, an HPCC environment which includes a Roxie cluster should also include a Thor cluster. The Thor cluster is used to build the distributed index files used by the Roxie cluster and to develop online queries which will be deployed with the index files to the Roxie cluster. Figure 4. HPCC software architecture  Software architecture  The HPCC software architecture incorporates the Thor and Roxie clusters as well as common middleware components, an external communications layer, client interfaces which provide both end-user services and system management tools, and auxiliary components to support monitoring and to facilitate loading and storing of filesystem data from external sources. Usually a HPCC environment includes only Thor clusters, or both Thor and Roxie clusters, although Roxie occasionally is used to build its own indexes. The overall HPCC software architecture is shown in Figure 4. HPCC Systems HPCC Systems (High Performance Computing Cluster) is part of LexisNexis Risk Solutions and was formed to promote and sell the HPCC software. In June 2011, it announced the offering of the software under an open source dual license model. HPCC Systems offers both a Community Edition and an Enterprise Edition. The Community Edition is free to download, includes the source code and is released under the Apache License 2.0. The Enterprise Edition is available under a paid commercial license and includes training, support, indemnification and additional modules. In November 2011, HPCC Systems announced the availability of its Thor Data Refinery Cluster on Amazon Web Services. In January 2012, HPCC Systems announced distributed machine learning algorithms.

Vitautus Alphonsus \\"Vito\\" Paulekas (20 May 1913 - 25 October 1992) was an American artist and bohemian, who was most notable for his leading role in the Southern California \\"freak scene\\" of the 1960s, and his influence on musicians including The Byrds, Love and Frank Zappa. Biography Paulekas was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, the son of Lithuanian immigrants. After some time spent in a reformatory as a teenager, he learned wood carving and won competitions as a marathon dancer in the 1930s. He was convicted of armed robbery in 1938, but was released in 1942 and joined the US Merchant Marine. Around 1946, he moved to Los Angeles where, by the early 1960s, he had set up home on Beverly Boulevard. There he established an art studio where he \\"made a living of sorts by giving clay modeling lessons to Beverly Hills matrons who found the atmosphere in his studio exciting,\\" and also ran dance classes. He married in 1961; his wife, Szou (b. Sueanne C. Shaffer, 1943) established a clothing boutique which was credited with being one of the first to introduce \\"hippie\\" fashions. Johnny Rogan, The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, p.66 Michael Walker, Laurel Canyon: The Inside Story of Rock-and-Roll's Legendary Neighborhood, p.28 By about 1963, Vito, Szou, and their friend Carl Franzoni (b. 1934 in Cincinnati, Ohio), also known at the time as \\"Captain Fuck\\", had begun going to clubs with a growing group of self-styled \\"freaks\\", who reputedly \\"lived a semi-communal life and engaged in sex orgies and free-form dancing whenever they could\\". According to writer Johnny Rogan, Paulekas' \\"free thinking lifestyle and artistic passion inspired beatniks, aspiring existentialists and Valley girls in need of rebellion.\\" In 1964, Paulekas offered rehearsal space to the Byrds, and the following year the troupe of free-form dancers, with Paulekas and Franzoni, accompanied the group on their nationwide tour. Later, Arthur Lee and Love also used his premises for rehearsals. In some clubs, Paulekas and the dancers became as big an attraction as the onstage entertainment. The troupe - including several of the young women later to become known as The GTOs, and members of the Fraternity of Man - occupied the Log Cabin in Laurel Canyon formerly occupied by Tom Mix and later by Frank Zappa. Credited as \\"Vito and the Hands\\", Paulekas recorded a single, \\"Where It's At,\\" which featured some of the Mothers of Invention, with producer Kim Fowley in 1966. He has been credited with first using the terms \\"freak\\" and \\"freak-out\\" to describe the scene, and with Franzoni and other members of the troupe contributed to the first album by Zappa and the Mothers, Freak Out!. He appeared in several documentaries of the period, including Mondo Hollywood (1967) and You Are What You Eat (1968).United Mutations: Vito Paulekas After Richard Nixon's election as US President in 1968, he moved to Haiti and later Jamaica, before returning to settle in Cotati, California. There, he and Franzoni established the Freestore street theatre and performance group, and built a bandstand for the town as well as contributing sculptures. City of Cotati official website: In the sixties Prudence and Lloyd Draper, Cotati, 2004 He and Szou divorced in 1975. They had five children, Gruvi, BB, Sky, Phreekus (Mark) and Godot who died as a child. Vito also had another child, Sophia Creme with Yara Mery in 1979. Paulekas died in Cotati in 1992, aged 79.

It includes instrumental chamber music, vocal-instrumental works both sacred and secular, orchestral concertos, and monumental works in the genres of opera and oratorio. Playing on original instruments, supported by study of period sources and aesthetics, has become indispensable and at the same time a characteristic trait of the ensemble. Musica Florea enjoyed soon its first notable success, including a performance and recording of Jan Dismas Zelenka's Missa Sanctissimae Trinitatis, which received an award from the music magazine Diapason in 1995. A recording of Johann Sebastian Bach's arias from cantatas and oratoria with Czech mezzo- soprano Magdalena Ko≈æen√° received Czech music award Golden Harmony in 1997. For the time being, the most success of the ensemble was Cannes Classical Award for the recording of Zelenka's melodrama Sub olea pacis et palma virtutis in 2003.

History In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1886, Morton County was established, which included land for modern day Wilburton. A post office was opened in Wilburton in 1913, and remained in operation until 1957. In the 1930s, the prosperity of the area was severely affected by its location within the Dust Bowl. This catastrophe intensified the economic impact of the Great Depression in the region. But up until the mid-1950s, the town held its own with a population of 1000‚Äì1500, served by a grocery, dry goods store, gas station, repair garage, a restaurant, complete system of public schools and several churches. Additional businesses included several grain elevators and a lumber yard. There was also a railroad station. From 1960 onward, Wilburton deteriorated very rapidly. It was disincorporated by the start of that decade. Businesses and services were all gone by the 1970s, and by the opening of the 21st century, most homes were gone or abandoned also, leaving one house opening onto Route 56 and two farms on a side road across the railroad tracks. Some have even designated it a ghost town, although all unused buildings have been torn down or moved.

It is one of three Last Supper frescoes painted by Ghirlandaio in Florence, the others being for the Badia di Passignano (1476) and for the Cenacolo di San Marco (1486). History The layout of the scene resembles that seen in the Andrea del Castagno's Last Supper frescoed some 3 to 4 decades earlier for the refectory of Sant'Apollonia in Florence, wherein the apostles sit in a shallow U-shaped setting, with only the two flanking apostles sitting at a 90 degree angle with the others. John the Apostle at Christ's left has fallen to sleep. Judas sits apart on the near side of the table, as is common in early depictions of the Last Supper in Christian art.

The halos of the apostles have narrowed into thin circles; and the apostles cast shadows. St Peter and another apostle appear to challenge Judas. Detail of the fresco Ghirlandaio was well known when he received the commission for this fresco, and soon after its completion, he was called to Rome to help decorate the Sistine Chapel. It is likely that Leonardo da Vinci was familiar with this treatment of the subject, as well as that of Castagno, and painted his own Last Supper in a more dramatic form to contrast with the stillness of these works, so that more emotion would be displayed.Leonardo da Vinci, the Last Supper: a cosmic drama and an act of redemption by Michael Ladwein 2006 page 27 During the restoration of this fresco, a preliminary sketch of it was discovered on the left wall of the refectory in Cenacolo di Ognissanti.

The series was filmed at Australian locations. Plot The protagonist Moss Andrews (played by Ty Hardin, who had previously appeared in Bronco) is a once successful US-American businessman who took a sabbatical after his wife had died prematurely. The widower undertook a long sailing trip, hoping that experiencing pure nature would give him some peace of mind. In Australia, the beautiful environment helped him to pull himself together again and therefore he has decided to stay for the time being, operating a charter boat company along the eastern seaboard. However, he is frequently bothered by suspicious characters who try to follow through on hidden schemes. He always manages eventually to put paid to all looming menaces. Production The show was announced in 1966 as Charter Boat. The series was filmed in colour. The budget was sufficient. Word is, Ty Hardin openly admitted being pleased: \\"We can make a Riptide episode here for $70,000. In the States it would cost $200,000.\\" Unfortunately for him, the reception of this product didn't meet the expectations of its producers. US-American broadcasters rejected the series and the enthusiasm of audiences in Australia and Europe was merely lukewarm. Subsequently, there was no second season for this TV show.

Stendahl (December 11, 1888 - May 18, 1966) was a pioneering American art dealer known for promoting California Impressionism, modern and pre- Columbian art. The gallery celebrated its centennial in 2011. Early life Stendahl was born in Menomonie, Wisconsin. His parents were confectioners. Career Stendahl moved to the Los Angeles area, where he opened his own candy store. He opened his first gallery in Pasadena, California in 1913. By 1921, he moved his gallery to the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He maintained a gallery on Wilshire Boulevard until 1949, where he moved it to his house on Hillside Avenue. Stendahl's son, Alfred E. Stendahl and son-in- law, Joseph Dammann, joined the family business. By the 1930s, the gallerist had established his reputation as the premier dealer in painters of the California Impressionist School. William Wendt, Guy Rose, Edgar Payne, Joseph Kleitsch and Nicolai Fechin were part of the early Stendahl stable of artists. Stendahl introduced Modern art to the West Coast with works by Matisse, Chagall, Klee, Feitelson, Siqueiros, Cant√∫, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. As early as 1935, Stendahl began promoting ancient artifacts from Mexico and Central America before branching out to become a significant dealer of the Pre-Columbian art of his day. He sold Mexican and Central American antiquities that were often stolen, looted, or assembled from disparate fragments. Often sold to Hollywood collectors, to museums, and even department stores. Stendahl's archives were recently donated to the Getty. By studying the photos and records researchers can trace the history of Pre-Hispanic artworks of ceramic and stone that passed through Stendahl's gallery. Personal life, death and legacy With his wife Enid, Stendahl had a son, Alfred, and a daughter, Mrs Eleanor E. Damman. They resided at 7055-65 Hillside Avenue in Hollywood, California. Stendahl died on May 18, 1966 in Morocco. His gallery archives were donated to the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art in 1976. The Stendahl Gallery continues to operate, celebrating its centennial in 2011, with Earl Stendahl's grandson, Ronald W. Dammann, presiding.

It is a parody of \\"Born This Way\\" by Lady Gaga. The lyrics are told from the point of view of Gaga and describe her performance style and fashion sense. The song is the sixth single from Yankovic's 2011 album Alpocalypse, and all the proceeds were donated to the Human Rights Campaign charity. Gaga herself has praised the work and has additionally described herself as a \\"Weird Al\\" fan. The song entered and peaked at number six on the Comedy Digital Tracks chart of Billboard, remaining for a total of eight weeks. Development Yankovic had already completed 11 songs for Alpocalypse, but still felt the need for another song to be the lead single. As \\"Born This Way\\" was becoming more and more popular, he started to consider parodying it, but he became reluctant after hearing the song, considering that spoofing \\"such an earnest human rights anthem\\" could be in bad taste, and also because a Lady Gaga parody was \\"what everybody in the universe was already assuming I would do, and I hate to be so predictable\\". Then Yankovic came to the idea of doing the spoof about Gaga herself, as he thought it \\"wasn‚Äôt really going to offend anybody\\". Yankovic then \\"worked around the clock to get the lyrics out\\" and interrupted a family vacation to record a demo that could be used to ask for Gaga's approval. Approval by Lady Gaga In April 2011, Yankovic reported that Lady Gaga refused him permission to release \\"Perform This Way\\", which he had hoped to use as the lead single for his upcoming album. Yankovic had originally sent the request to parody the song to Gaga's manager, who responded that they would need to see his lyrics to make an assessment. Yankovic was touring in Australia at the time, and hastily created the lyrics for approval. Yankovic further stated that Gaga's management insisted on reviewing a recorded version of the song, and he had cut a family vacation short to turn the recorded version around. Ultimately, he was told that she refused to allow the parody. Yankovic had considered the song key to his Alpocalypse album, but due to the rejection, he had begun the process to postpone its release until he could record a new song to take the place of \\"Perform This Way\\". Following the refusal, he released his parody online on April 20, 2011, and encouraged donations to the Human Rights Campaign. Yankovic was initially fearful of parodying Gaga's song, considering it \\"an important gay-rights anthem\\", but had hit upon making the parody about Gaga's fashion, and tying in the sales of the song and video to charity as an act of \\"good karma\\" due to the human rights message of the original song. Shortly after its upload to YouTube, word about the song spread among Yankovic's fans, primarily along Twitter, according to Yankovic, and the video had received over 2 million views. The word spread to Lady Gaga and her staff, and eventually it was discovered she herself had not yet heard the song and the refusal had come from Gaga's manager without her input. As Lady Gaga is \\"a huge Weird Al fan\\", she subsequently gave Yankovic the green light to include the song on his upcoming album and said she loved the parody. Lady Gaga later considered being parodied by Yankovic as a \\"rite of passage\\" for her musical career and considered the song \\"very empowering\\". Within a day of receiving permission to use the parody, Yankovic had reaffirmed the song's inclusion on Alpocalypse and was able to set the day of release for the album; Yankovic claimed that \\"Twitter saved my album\\". Regardless of Gaga's permission, Yankovic will still contribute sales of the song to charity. Music video Yankovic had confirmed that the song would have a video to be released along with the album that would be \\"beyond awesome, and disturbing on many levels\\". A thirty-second video teaser was released on June 17, 2011, and the video was released on June 20, 2011, on Vevo and YouTube. The video was shown on VH1 Online, AMTV and Jump Start. The video was directed by Yankovic himself, and features Al's head superimposed on the bodies of dancer Vlada Gorbaneva and contortionist Marissa Heart using CG effects. Throughout the video, \\"Yankovic\\" dances in a number of different outlandish outfits, some inspired by the song's lyrics such as a gold lam√© straitjacket, while others are parodies of outfits that Lady Gaga has worn, such as her meat dress and a dress made out of bubbles for The Fame Ball Tour. One of the outfits, a peacock costume, is worn by Yankovic on live performances of the song. Yankovic found it a challenge to distill Gaga's public performances as \\"she's got so many different looks\\", and had difficulty \\"figuring out how we're going to do two dozen costumes in three minutes\\" for the video. Work on the video started immediately after Yankovic was able to affirm Gaga's permission for the parody, and was completed only days before its release on YouTube. The video includes a Madonna lookalike played by Holly Beavon, a reference to numerous comparisons between Madonna and Gaga's musical styles, and also to the similarities between \\"Born This Way\\" with Madonna's \\"Express Yourself\\". Yankovic considered this his last big-budget video that he would produce. While the label fronted him the money to produce it, Yankovic had to pay that back through royalties. The cost was considerably high due to the large number of costumes involved, and Yankovic noted that record labels are not as flush with money as they used to be to fund extravagant videos. At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, the video was nominated in the category of Best Short Form Music Video.

(n.d.). Dictionary.com  Free Online Dictionary for English Definitions. Retrieved April 28, 2011, from http://dictionary.reference.com The word \\"reverence\\" in the modern day is often used in relationship with religion. This is because religion often stimulates the emotion through recognition of God, the supernatural, and the ineffable. Reverence involves a humbling of the self in respectful recognition of something perceived to be greater than the self. Thus religion is commonly a place where reverence is felt. However, similar to awe, reverence is an emotion in its own right, and can be felt outside of the realm of religion. Whereas awe may be characterized as an overwhelming \\"sensitivity to greatness,\\" reverence is seen more as \\"acknowledging a subjective response to something excellent in a personal (moral or spiritual) way, but qualitatively above oneself\\" Roberts, R. C. (2003). Emotions: An essay in aid of moral psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 268 Solomon describes awe as passive, but reverence as active, noting that the feeling of awe (i.e., becoming awestruck) implies paralysis, whereas feelings of reverence are associated more with active engagement and responsibility toward that which one reveres.Solomon, R. C. (2002). Spirituality for the skeptic: The thoughtful love of life. New York: Oxford University Press Nature, science, literature, philosophy, great philosophers, leaders, artists, art, music, wisdom, and beauty may each act as the stimulus and focus of reverence.  Religion and music  David Pugmire's article, \\"The Secular Reception of Religious Music\\" explores the unique experience of reverence through music. In particular he looks at how religious music has the capacity to instill emotions of reverence, awe, wonder, and veneration in secular people who lack the context to fully understand the transcendent through religion. \\"Sacred music seems to have a surprising power over unbelievers not just to quicken or delight them as other music does, but also to ply them, as little else can, with what might be called devotional feelings\\".Pugmire, D. (2006). The Secular Reception of Religious Music. Philosophy, 81(315), 65-79. Even with this though, Pugmire argues that the secularist cannot fully comprehend the nature of sacred art including sacred music. \\"Its undoubted expressiveness can lead him at most to accesses of feeling, not to emotion in the fullest sense, i.e., emotion with appropriate objects sustained by appropriate judgments\\". Pugmire believes that reverence belongs to the range of emotions that can be classified in their devotional or sacred forms, \\"Emotions of reverence, solemnity, agape, hope, serenity, and ecstasy\\". But this classification of emotions poses an interesting question: can any emotion be purely religious? \\"A central candidate for a distinctively religious emotion would be reverence\\". But it is not entirely distinct from the rest of the emotions that are not related to transcendence or religion. \\"Reverence is indeed graver, and an attitude in which one is more given over, than its secular approximations in the shape of approval or esteem or respect\\". But this does not make it purely religious. In fact, \\"Kant was able to claim reverence as our principal moral emotion without invoking any grounding theological basis for this\\". \\"Similarly for its bracing sibling, awe: it figures in our experience of the sublime, of which Kant purports to find an entirely secular account\\". To connect the secular and the sacred emotions Pugmire looks at the emotions which can be experienced equally in both contexts. These are, \\"Love, humility, sorrow, pity, joy, serenity, ecstasy\\". Pugmire then suggests that devotional emotion is: \\"The transfiguring of mundane emotion into what one might call emotion of the last instance, to the reception and expression of which religious imagery is especially well-suited, and not accidentally\\". The emotion of the last instance refers to the capacity of the emotional imagination to lose the sense of self and engage in the infinite and the ineffable. Pugmire is suggesting that religion, \\"Provides a strikingly apt vocabulary for the expression of emotion of the last instance\\". Reverence is perhaps the most critical of these \\"emotions of the last instance\\" and can be adequately accessed through religious music. Theorists = Paul Woodruff = Paul Woodruff in his book, Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue, assesses the current understanding of the emotion reverence in the modern era. He assesses that a true understanding of reverence is missing from both modern society and the \\"modern discussions of the ancient cultures that prized it\\" (Woodruff, p. 3). Specifically these ancient cultures include Greece and China. Woodruff's best definition of Reverence is, \\"The well-developed capacity to have the feelings of awe, respect, and shame when these are the right feelings to have\\" (Woodruff, p. 8). Thus Woodruff's definition of reverence includes the combination of three other emotions: respect, shame, and awe. \\"Respect is for other people, shame is over one‚Äôs own shortcomings, and awe is usually felt toward something transcendent\\" (Woodruff, p. 65). Although Woodruff acknowledges the relationship between reverence and religion he argues that, \\"Reverence has more to do with politics than with religion\\" (Woodruff, p. 4). Woodruff in his book is trying to separate the common misunderstanding that reverent emotions can only be related to religion. Woodruff sees ceremony and ritual as key elements in meaningful human life when practiced with reverence. \\"Without reverence, rituals are empty\\" (Woodruff, p. 19). Ceremony and ritual are found at home, in meetings, in voting, and in religion and these acts provide the context for feeling reverence. But often these situations are so common the emotion reverence disappears from human consciousness. \\"Ritual and reverence in common life are so familiar that we scarcely notice them until they are gone\\" (Woodruff, p. 35). Woodruff argues that, \\"Reverence, ceremony and respect do not disappear, they cannot disappear from a functioning society\\" (Woodruff, p. 36). He states that \\"What we are losing is not reverence, but the idea of reverence\\" (Woodruff, p. 36). It is his hope that the importance of reverence will be recognized in society again and that this recognition will better humanity. He proposes to \\"Restore the idea of reverence to its proper place in ethical and political thought\\" (Woodruff, p. 38). Woodruff understands true reverence to be for things beyond human control. \\"The object of reverence is the ideal of unity, because that transcends politics altogether\\" (Woodruff, p. 28). Thus reverence focuses on an ideal that transcends the scope of humankind. This ideal can vary from God, to unity, to anything else that transcends human capacity. \\"Reverence sets a higher value on the truth than on any human product that is supposed to have captured the truth\\" (Woodruff, p. 39). He goes on to say that, \\"The principal object of reverence is Something that reminds us of human limitations\\" (Woodruff, p. 65). Reverence therefore is related to truth and the recognition that mankind cannot acquire absolute truth and that human life is finite. Woodruff describes how reverence is often activated through music. Woodruff claims that \\"Reverence cannot be expressed in a creed; its most apt expression is in music\\" (Woodruff, p. 123). He gives the analogy of a quartet of varying skill levels playing a piece by Mozart. They embody reverence because: \\"(1) The musicians have been engaged, more or less harmoniously, on a project as a group; (2) their project involved ceremony; (3) they have felt themselves largely without ego; (4) they have felt themselves to be part of a clearly defined hierarchy that was painless for all of them; and (5) they have achieved in the end a shared feeling of inarticulate awe\\" (Woodruff, p. 48-49). This coincides with his belief that \\"Art speaks the language of reverence better than philosophy does, and speak(s) it to the reverence that is already in the town\\" (Woodruff, p. 25). By \\"in the town\\" Woodruff is referring to the recognition of reverence that is already present. \\"In the presence of death we expect ourselves and others to be reverent; the expectation feels natural, and yet the ceremonies through which we express reverence at such times take very different forms in different cultures\\" (Woodruff, p. 50). In his conversation on funerals as times of reverence he makes the point that reverence transcends faith and that it is constant throughout human history even when religions change (Woodruff, p. 54.). \\"You need not believe in God to be reverent, but to develop an occasion for reverence you must share a culture with others, and this must support a degree of ceremony\\" (Woodruff, p. 50). Reverence is not dependent on religion, but true religious experience is dependent on the emotion reverence. Paul Woodruff builds his case on reverence by analyzing the historical significance of reverence as a virtue. In Ancient Greek and Chinese civilizations, \\"Both cultures celebrate reverence in the belief that it is reverence above all that maintains social order and harmony\\" (Woodruff, p. 60). For the Greeks reverence was rooted in mythology. \\"Protagoras invented a myth in which the highest god gave reverence and justice to human beings as means for the survival of society\\" (Woodruff, p. 57). This foundation was critical because \\"Emotions affect action; they are motivators\\" (Woodruff, p. 62). Reverence in classical Greek society then motivated the populous to act rightly and be humble to improve society. \\"We feel awe for what we believe is above us all as human beings, and this feeling helps us to avoid treating other human beings with contempt\\" (Woodruff, p. 63). Woodruff uses the Greek heroes and Athenian tragedies to illustrate his conception of reverence. He uses the story of Croesus by Herodotus to help shape an understanding of reverence that includes respect for those lower in hierarchical status. \\"A reverent soul listens to other people even when they are inferior; that is a large part of remembering that you are human together with them\\" (Woodruff, p. 83). He also illustrates reverence with the Iliad, Antigone, Pentheus, Pericles, Socrates, Plato, Oedipus, and the Odyssey. Through these figures he shows that reverence was quite significant in Greek culture. In Oedipus, Woodruff asserts that, \\"Hubris is best understood simply as the opposite of reverence, in action or attitude\\" (Woodruff, p. 91). After building his case with a look at classical Greek culture he looks at classical Chinese Confucian society. \\"Filial piety expresses reverence within the family\\" (Woodruff, p. 103). The most important part of his connection between reverence and the Chinese is his understanding of li. \\"Li refers also to civility or reverence\\" (Woodruff, p. 105). One interesting connection between Greek and Chinese societies is that, \\"Both conceptions of reverence blossom with the passing away of polytheism and the rise of agnosticism. Reverence survives and flourishes in these circumstances because it is something that human beings need in order to face the most obvious, common, and inevitable facts of human life ‚Äì family, hierarchy, and death\\" (Woodruff, p. 110). Most of his information on reverence in Chinese culture derives from the Analects. Woodruff believes that a break in tradition is not necessarily irreverent and that relativism is flawed. People should be critical of all cultures and forms of reverence (Woodruff, p. 155). = Abraham Maslow = Abraham Maslow in his significant work, Religions, Values, and Peak-Experiences, deals extensively with reverence. Reverence is critical in having a peak-experience. He makes the case that peak-experiences happen for the religious and non-religious alike and that they are critical to having a fulfilling life. For Maslow the distinction between the secular and the profane is unfortunate. Maslow points out that, \\"Religionizing only one part of life secularizes the rest of it\\".Maslow, A. H. (1964). Religions, values, and peak-experiences, . Columbus: Ohio State University Press Maslow contends that religion seeks to make the emotion reverence possible through ritual, but that the familiarity of it often negates any reverent feelings. In defining peak-experiences Maslow states that, \\"Such emotions as wonder, awe, reverence, humility, surrender, and even worship before the greatness of the experience are often reported\\". Reverence therefore is a key ingredient in the peak- experiences that make life worth living and make mankind feel fully human. = Albert Schweitzer = Albert Schweitzer, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and holder of four PhD degrees, sought for years for the basis of a new worldview. One day, while in a boat on the river in Gabon, it struck him with great force and clarity: \\"Reverence for life\\" (In German: Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben).  Empirical studies  = Patient recovery = Empirical studies on reverence are scarce. However, one intriguing study on reverence is, \\"Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass,\\" conducted by Ai et al. (2009).Ai, A. L., Wink, P., Tice, T. N., Bolling, S. F., & Shearer, M. (2009). Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 32(6), 570-581. These researchers looked at reverence following a coronary artery bypass. Ai et al. (2009) examined a \\"sense of reverence in religious and secular contexts\\" by interviewing 177 patients. Specifically they were investigating the faith-health relationship and seeking to find if religious forms of reverence practiced through faith and prayer yielded similar results to secular forms of reverence in patient recovery. Ai et al. (2009)state that, \\"Because reverence includes an affective as well as a cognitive component, we see it as a form of positive feeling/emotion associated with injection of the sacred into various worldviews\\". These positive emotions were believed to help in patient recovery. The first finding of Ai et al. (2009) was consistent with other research that found \\"Positive influences of traditional religious involvement on health outcomes\\". The second finding of Ai et al. (2009) was the \\"Positive effect of secular reverence on postoperative no-complication\\". From this Ai et al. (2009) inferred that, \\"The capacity to sense reverence in significant naturalistic, moralistic, and aesthetic contexts seems to enhance recovery following bypass\\". Strangely, \\"Religious reverence did not have the same beneficial effect as secular reverence on bypass recovery\\". This inconsistency suggests that more research needs to be done on reverence in patient recovery. = Awe = Keltner and Haidt's extensive study on awe focuses on the importance of vastness and accommodation in experiencing awe. \\"Vastness refers to anything that is experienced as being much larger that the self\\".Keltner, D., & Haidt, J. (2003). Approaching awe, a moral, spiritual, and aesthetic emotion. Cognition and Emotion, 17(2), 297-314. Accommodation refers to the \\"Process of adjusting mental structures that cannot assimilate a new experience\\". Their research on awe, which is a part of reverence, and how it is experienced through moral, spiritual, and aesthetic means, sheds light on the greater understanding of reverence. Their study also consists of a comprehensive summary on what has been \\"Written about awe in religion, philosophy, sociology, and psychology\\" and their own addition of \\"Related states such as admiration, elevation, and the epiphanic experience\\". Haidt (2000) Haidt, J. (2000). The positive emotion of elevation. Prevention and Treatment, 3 Article 3. p 287. Available online at: http://journals.apa.org/prevention/volume3/pre0030003c.html notes that since Maslow (1964) studied the changes that actualizing experiences can bring about in people's identities and in their moral and spiritual lives, little empirical research has been done to examine the peak experiences and moral transformations associated with positive moral emotions such as gratitude, elevation, awe, admiration, and reverence. Haidt's own work in these areas suggests that potent feelings of reverence may be associated with the peak experiences accompanying moral transformations, where, \\"Powerful moments of elevation sometimes seem to push a mental ‚Äòreset button,‚Äô wiping out feelings of cynicism and replacing them with feelings of hope, love, and optimism, and a sense of moral inspiration.\\" Haidt, J. (2000), p 287 = Art and mortality = Great artists in the creation of their art sometimes give concrete form to the culturally derived beliefs, values, and group identities that provide meaning and purpose to existence. Moreover, reverence for artwork that instantiates these central aspects of culture can provide a means of buffering the existential anxiety that follows from reminders of the inevitability of human mortality.Landau, M. J., Sullivan, D., & Solomon, S. (2010) On graves and graven images: A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of art. European Review of Social psychology, 21, 114-154 Across history, cultures have revered art as a \\"forum for representing in an enduring medium those individuals who are held up as embodiments of virtue and lasting significance.\\" Landau et al. (2010), p. 123 = Transpersonality = Thomas and Schlutsmeyer in, \\"A Place for the Aesthetic in Experiential Personal Construct Psychology,\\" look at reverence through the lens of experiential personal construct psychology (EPCP). Leitner & Pfenninger, in 1994, theorized this form of psychology in \\"Sociality and optimal functioning.\\" Under this umbrella of psychology, \\"Reverence felt in meaningful interpersonal connectedness is one starting point for the development of a larger sense of connection with the world and the many others (human and nonhuman) in it\\".Thomas, J. C., & Schlutsmeyer, M. W. (2004). A place for the aesthetic in experiential personal construct psychology. Journal of Constructivist Psychology, 17(4), 313-335. This is referred to as transpersonal reverence. Thomas and Schlutsmeyer make the case for reverence in therapy: \\"In EPCP, reverence, as we stated earlier, is a goal of therapy, a sign of optimal functioning\\". The therapist must revere the patient and the patient must learn to revere others and themselves in order for the therapy to be effective.

The comic was created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Jason Howard, who had previously worked together on Image's The Astounding Wolf-Man.  Publication history  The idea for Super Dinosaur originated approximately two years prior to the series debut. Jason Howard drew a picture of a Tyrannosaurus with a cape for his then-five-year-old son. Howard shared the sketch with Robert Kirkman, who suggested the dinosaur's natural small arms could control larger robotic ones. \\"It was that goofy visual that was the beginning of the concept,\\" Kirkman told USA Today. Both Kirkman and Howard wanted to create a comic that they could read with their children and enjoy together. Kirkman described Super Dinosaur as \\"a Pixar movie on paper ... I want it to be a true all-ages book in that it's appropriate for kids young enough but still able to read, and it's still something that my fan base will probably enjoy.\\"  Plot synopsis  Scientists Doctor Dynamo and Max Maximus discovered a hole in the Earth that led to Inner Earth, a place where dinosaurs live. In addition to dinosaurs, Inner Earth is home to DynOre, a valuable deposit of solar power contained in a rock. While conducting experiments there, Maximus genetically altered a Tyrannosaurus, with which he tried to take over the world. Doctor Dynamo and his son, Derek, stopped him and formed a team with the Super Dinosaur to protect Inner Earth from Maximus. As Kirkman explains:  Characters  Heroes *Derek Dynamo: 10-year-old son of Doctor Dynamo; genius inventor. Derek is a fun-loving, enthusiastic boy who possesses genius-level intelligence and has decided to use it to fight crime alongside his friend and partner, Super Dinosaur. At the start of the series, Derek is shown living with his father and Super Dinosaur at a secret military installation called the Dynamo Dome, shown inventing various combat devices to be used against rogues such as the evil Doctor Maximus. When crime-fighting, Derek uses a variety of technical inventions, such as wrist-mounted battle gauntlets, mechanical exoskeletons, and a transforming robot called Wheels. Very little has been shown of Derek's past, but what is known is that Derek was badly injured in a fight with Max Maximus, an injury so bad that some of his memories were lost, mainly those of his mother. Derek is cocky, arrogant and sore loser; he openly taunts his foes in battle. But he is also honourable, determined and kind. Due to his need to see what The Exile looked like, he had indirectly set himself up for capture. When The Exile took over Earth Corps HQ, he hacked into the systems and kidnapped Derek with the hopes of presenting him to his people, as proof that life exists on Outer Earth. *Super Dinosaur: genetically altered Tyrannosaurus rex; Derek's best friend. Often referred to as SD, Super Dinosaur was created several years prior when Doctor Dynamo and Doctor Maximus first discovered the Inner Earth, a prehistoric land inhabited by ancient dinosaurs and found underneath the Earth's crust. Without Dynamo's knowledge, Maximus took an unhatched T-Rex egg back to the surface to study, and went about experimenting on the egg which contain a fetal Super Dinosaur. In addition to increasing his intelligence, Maximus limited Super Dinosaur's size to make him more manageable; with the intent of using him as prototype for a race of genetically engineered dinosaur soldiers by which to conquer the world. Unfortunately for Maximus, Super Dinosaur proved too intelligent, and turned against him in order to fight evil with the Dynamos. When fighting super- villains, Super Dinosaur wears several types of mechanical harnesses that act as exoskeletons which he operates with miniature control pads customized for his limited reach. Super Dinosaur enjoys playing video games, basketball, and using slang introduced to him by Derek when relaxing at the Dynamo Dome. *Doctor Dexter Dynamo: Derek's father and scientist; co-discoverer of Inner Earth and the energy-producing element Dynore with former partner Max Maximus. Prior to the start of the series, he was involved in an industrial explosion caused by Maximus which left his intelligence stunted to the point where Derek oversees the majority of his work. Maximus not only limited Dynamo's intelligence, but also erased the memories of his missing wife, Julianna, from both Derek and Dynamo's minds, as well as capturing her to use as leverage. Doctor Dynamo later agrees to aid Maximus in his escape from prison under the condition that Maximus release Julianna. *General Casey: Military administrator to the Dynamos and their super-heroic activities; oversees the majority of their funding, deployment into combat situations, and imprisonment of defeated super-villains at Earthcore Headquarters. In combat against The Exile, he is shown to use a power-suit and \\"Gun-Hammer\\", an energy-rifle that can transform into a gravity-hammer. Battle Shock: General Casey's impulsive son. A young boy, about the same age as Derek, who attempted to capture a destitute Squidious single-handedly with stolen military equipment (imitating the antics of Derek). He was later grounded by Casey. *Wheels: a robot created by Derek (with a head similar to Allen the Alien) that he often uses as an impromptu transportation device. Can transform into a skateboard, hover-board, jetpack, and underwater diving motor. *The Kingstons: A family of mechanics who recently moved into the Dynamo's headquarters to provide technical support; responsible for building and repairing Derek and Super Dinosaur's combat equipment. Bruce: Husband to Sarah and father to Erin and Erica. Sarah: Wife to Bruce and mother to Erin and Erica. Erin: A charismatic and curious girl who makes quick friends with Derek upon the Kingston's arrival to the Dynamo Dome. She is fascinated by all the amazing technology created by Doctor Dynamo and Derek and responds to her family's move much more positively than her sister. She has a crush on Derek. Erica: An initially sullen girl who remains uncooperative with the thought of living with the Dynamos and moving away from her life in Washington D.C.. She somewhat maliciously re- activated a tracking device which led to Maximus learning the location of the Dynamo Dome and attacking it with the massive Mega-Raptor in hopes of killing Doctor Dynamo and Derek. She expressed regret over these actions, and admitted that she thought if the location of the Dynamo Dome was compromised that she would be able to go back home. Derek and her family later forgave her after the fight with Maximus, being that her actions indirectly led to his capture. She is next seen warming up to Super Dinosaur by asking him to teach her how to play basketball. *Pixie: a robot created by Derek (a replica of Wheels but with a pink color-scheme) and given to Erin as a gift so that she would have her own robot. Villains *Doctor Max Maximus: evil scientist; former colleague of Doctor Dynamo. Maximus is responsible for the majority of tragedies that have befallen the Dynamos, such as his attempts to steal Dynore (which he refers to as Maxinite), conquer the surface world and Inner Earth, and erasing Doctor Dynamo's wife from his and Derek's memories. In retrospect, Maximus' repeated attempts to rediscover Inner Earth are hampered by the fact that the majority of his memories were erased by the Dynamos after his first betrayal, making their current situation somewhat retaliatory from Maximus' perspective. Sporting a shaved head and goatee, he is prone to traditional mad scientist megalomania and believes himself to be vastly more intelligent and worthy of recognition than either of the Dynamos, much to the point that many of his schemes revolve around destroying them first and then taking over the world. He is currently holding Doctor Dynamo's wife, Julianna, captive in exchange for Dynamo breaking him out of prison. His left arm is a robotic prosthetic made to replace the one that was bitten off by Super Dinosaur during his first battle the Dynamos, and he has been shown to wear a pair of jet-boots capable of flight. *Dino-Men: A group of genetically engineered anthropomorphized dinosaur/human hybrids who formerly served Maximus but currently hold world- conquering plans of their own. Unlike Super Dinosaur, they remain at full physically size/intelligence and often rely on their brute strength to solve problems. The Exile: Former leader of the Dino-Men. Shown wearing black-and- yellow armor with a volatile energy staff composed of Dynore. He believes in the genetic superiority of the Dino-Men over the human race, and has been seen working with Squidious to reach his goals. The first person to be betrayed by him was Squidious, he anticipated that at some point the latter would act irrationally. Squidious confirmed this when he attacked Derek and SD rather than defuse any explosives they planted on near-by cave entrances. In his absence, The Exile began to sow the seeds of mutiny aboard Squidious' ship; thus he ousted Squidious from his own ship, turning his own crew against him. During his first battle with Super Dinosaur and Derek, Derek notes that the source of power of the staff was Dynore, and that he had never seen it used so elegantly, with the capability to keep it stabilized and use it as a weapon. He wishes to take control of Earth by using the Dino-men under his leadership as pawns. After several clashes with Derek and SD, The Exile is later captured by the duo and unmasked, revealing that he is actually a highly evolved form of reptile who claims to be the vanguard of The Reptiloid Empire, a humanoid race of lizard-men from Inner Earth who seek war with the human race. In issues 12 through to 15, it is revealed that The Exile is actually from the very centre of the planet. He was exiled because his brother, the ruler of the empire, was suspicious of him attempting a coup because he wanted to explore Outer-Earth. The Exile's attempts to get into inner earth were not to start an illegal mining operation as was first thought, but rather to get back home with the hopes of summoning an invasion army. During his attempts, he figured that simply entering alone would not suffice, he had to bring back evidence of intelligent life, a prisoner, Derek Dynamo. Tricerachops: A female triceratops who wields a battle-axe. She initially holds no ill-will towards Derek and Super Dinosaur for attacking Dino-Men loyal to Maximus and questions why they must be enemies rather than allies. However, as Derek points out, while some Dino-Men are not minions of Maximus, they all still want to take over the world. Tricerachops later joins Tryannosaurus-X and becomes his mate. Terrordactyl: A pterodactyl who uses air-based weaponry. While hiding in Squidious' underwater lair, he is revealed to have some form of aquaphobia which causes him to have a panic attack and escape to the surface where he inadvertently catches the attention of Derek and Super Dinosaur. Dreadasaurus: A stegosaurus. Breakeosaurus: A brachiosaurus. *Maximus' Dino-Men: A subset of dinosaur minions created to be completely loyal to Professor Maximus. Painkylosaurus: An ankylosaurus; wields a sword. Doometrodon: A dimetrodon; has a mini-gun shoulder-mounted on his right arm. Byronobeast: A raptor. Type unknown. Unnamed Parasaurolophus: A parasaurolophus. Mega-Raptor: A gigantic velociraptor created by Maximus to be the anti-thesis of Super Dinosaur; he is easier to control because he is twice as large and only half as intelligent. Also referred to as Project X, Mega-Raptor uses a pair of mechanical talons attached to its forearms as weapons. It is used by Maximus during his assault on the Dynamo Dome before being fought and taken down by Derek and Super Dinosaur. Ironically, Maximus' repeated boasting about his total control over Mega-Raptor's actions lead Derek to believe that Maximus was so paranoid of Mega-Raptor turning against him that he included an \\"off-switch\\" somewhere on the creature (which later turned out to be true) to keep him in check. Minimus: An imperfect clone of Maximus created to be the ideal lab assistant capable of carrying out Maximus' schemes while in prison. Although initially human, Minimus was genetically altered with dinosaur DNA to perfect his inherent cellular degradation, a process which is slowly causing him to \\"evolve\\" into a Dino-man himself. After Maximus helps him by overdosing him on Dynore, he evolves into a larger, muscular anthropomorph T-rex form and taxes the name Tyrannosaurus-X. While initially he replaces Maximus as a tyrant over the Dino-Men, his defeat by Derek makes him realize they can only beat the Dynamos together, as equals. *Squidious: A super-intelligent giant squid with the ability to manipulate minerals, such as coral and molten rock, into handheld weapons and humanoid limbs. Squidious is known to have a short temper and is prone to rampage when people disrespect him, as shown when Derek refers to him as Squidiot during a fight. Throughout the series, he claims dominion over the oceans and is shown operating in an underwater city/base-of-operations staffed by Shark-Men, constructed upon the back of a kronosaurus. In Super Dinosaur #6, The Exile betrays Squidious and leads a mutiny against him with the aid of his own Shark-Men. Seeking the help of General Casey, Squidious plots revenge against The Exile and his forces by agreeing to fight alongside Derek and SD in an effort to foil The Exile's plans and reclaim his underwater throne. Shark- Men: Humanoid shark minions of Squidious who betray him in favor of The Exile. They are not very intelligent, and claim to only follow those who are strongest. *Erupticus: A villain who has not been seen yet, mentioned off- handedly by Derek in Super Dinosaur #5, as one of the bad guys he and Super Dinosaur have yet to apprehend. Super Dinosaur considers him to be \\"...the worst!\\"  Reception  Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources described the first issue of the series as \\"compelling and fun, and oh, so very comic booky. This is the type of all ages comic that truly plays well to all ages without pandering, demeaning, or flat-out lying.

Plants created using mutagenesis are sometimes called mutagenic plants or mutagenic seeds. From 1930 to 2014 more than 3200 mutagenic plant varieties were released that have been derived either as direct mutants (70%) or from their progeny (30%). Crop plants account for 75% of released mutagenic species with the remaining 25% ornamentals or decorative plants. However, although the FAO/IAEA reported in 2014 that over 1,000 mutant varieties of major staple crops were being grown worldwide,(2014) Plant Breeding and Genetics Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, Retrieved 31 July 2014 it is unclear how many of these varieties are currently used in agriculture or horticulture around the world, as these seeds are not always identified or labeled as having a mutagenic provenance.Kaskey, Jack (21 November 2013) The Scariest Veggies of Them All Bloomberg Business Week, Retrieved 31 July 2014 Process There are different kinds of mutagenic breeding such as using chemical mutagens like ethyl methanesulfonate and dimethyl sulfate, radiation or transposons to generate mutants. Mutation breeding is commonly used to produce traits in crops such as larger seeds, new colors, or sweeter fruits, that either cannot be found in nature or have been lost during evolution. Radiation breeding Exposing plants to radiation is sometimes called radiation breeding and is a sub class of mutagenic breeding. Radiation breeding was discovered in the 1920s when Lewis Stadler of the University of Missouri used X-rays on maize and barley. In the case of barley, the resulting plants were white, yellow, pale yellow and some had white stripes. In 1928, Stadler first published his findings on radiation-induced mutagenesis in plants. During the period 1930‚Äì2004, radiation-induced mutant varieties were developed primarily using gamma rays (64%) and X-rays (22%). Radiation breeding may take place in atomic gardens;Atomic Gardens: Public Perceptions & Public Policy , Life Sciences Foundation Magazine, Spring 2012. and seeds have been sent into orbit in order to expose them to more cosmic radiation. Use of chemical mutagens High rates of chromosome aberrations resulting from ionizing radiation and the accompanied detrimental effects made researchers look for alternate sources for inducing mutations. As a result, an array of chemical mutagens has been discovered. The most widely used chemical mutagens are alkylating agents. Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) is the most popular because of its effectiveness and ease of handling, especially its detoxification through hydrolysis for disposal. Nitroso compounds are the other alkylating agents widely used, but they are light-sensitive and more precautions need to be taken because of their higher volatility. EMS has become a commonly used mutagen for developing large numbers of mutants for screening such as in developing TILLING populations.Pathirana, R. Plant Mutation Breeding in Agriculture. CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources. 2011 6 No 032 Although many chemicals are mutagens, only few have been used in practical breeding as the doses need to be optimised and also because the effectiveness is not high in plants for many. History According to garden historian Paige Johnson Comparison to other agronomic techniques In the debate over genetically modified foods, the use of transgenic processes is often compared and contrasted with mutagenic processes.UK Government Science Review First Report, Prepared by the GM Science Review panel (July 2003). Chairman Professor Sir David King, Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government, P 9: \\"...it is necessary to produce about 100 GM plants to obtain one that has the desirable characters for its use as a basis of a new GM crop variety. ... Most of these so-called conventional plant breeding methods (such as gene transfer by pollination, mutation breeding, cell selection and induced polyploidy) have a substantially greater discard rate. Mutation breeding, for instance, involves the production of unpredictable and undirected genetic changes and many thousands, even millions, of undesirable plants are discarded in order to identify plants with suitable qualities for further breeding.\\" While the abundance and variation of transgenic organisms in human food systems, and their effect on agricultural biodiversity, ecosystem health and human health is somewhat well documented, mutagenic plants and their role on human food systems is less well known, with one journalist writing \\"Though poorly known, radiation breeding has produced thousands of useful mutants and a sizable fraction of the world's crops...including varieties of rice, wheat, barley, pears, peas, cotton, peppermint, sunflowers, peanuts, grapefruit, sesame, bananas, cassava and sorghum.\\" In Canada crops generated by mutation breeding face the same regulations and testing as crops obtained by genetic engineering.The Canadian regulatory system is based on whether a product has novel features regardless of method of origin. In other words, a product is regulated as genetically modified if it carries some trait not previously found in the species whether it was generated using mutation breeding or genetic engineering (or any other method including selective breeding).Evans, Brent and Lupescu, Mihai (15 July 2012) Canada - Agricultural Biotechnology Annual ‚Äì 2012 GAIN (Global Agricultural Information Network) report CA12029, United States Department of Agriculture, Foreifn Agricultural Service, Retrieved 7 August 2014 Mutagenic varieties tend to be made freely available for plant breeding, in contrast to many commercial plant varieties or germplasm that increasingly have restrictions on their use such as terms of use, patents and proposed genetic user restriction technologies and other intellectual property regimes and modes of enforcement. Unlike genetically modified crops, which typically involve the insertion of one or two target genes, plants developed via mutagenic processes with random, multiple and unspecific genetic changesUseful Mutants, Bred With Radiation, by William J.

Reports from the US National Academy of Sciences state that there is no scientific justification for regulating genetic engineered crops while not doing so for mutation breeding crops. Several organic food and seed companies promote and sell certified organic products that were developed using both chemical and nuclear mutagenesis.Mendel in the Kitchen: A Scientist's View of Genetically Modified Foods, By Nina V. Fedoroff and Nancy Marie Brow, pg. 17, Joseph Henry Press, 2004. Several certified organic brands, whose companies support strict labeling or outright bans on GMO-crops, market their use of branded wheat and other varietal strains which were derived from mutagenic processes without any reference to this genetic manipulation. These organic products range from mutagenic barley and wheat ingredient used in organic beersGolden Promise Organic Ale to mutagenic varieties of grapefruits sold directly to consumers as organic.Wasatch Organic Rio Red Grapefruit New mutagen techniques = Restriction endonucleases = Interest in the use of bacterial restriction endonucleases (RE) to study double-stranded breaks in plant DNA began in the mid-nineties. These breaks in DNA, otherwise known as DSBs, were found to be the source of much chromosomal damage in eukaryotes, causing mutations in plant varieties. REs induce a result on plant DNA similar to that of ionizing radiation or radiomimetic chemicals. Blunt ended breaks in the DNA, unlike sticky ended breaks, were found to produce more variations in chromosomal damage, making them the more useful type of break for mutation breeding. While the connection of REs to chromosomal aberrations is mostly limited to research on mammalian DNA, success in mammalian studies caused scientists to conduct more studies of RE- induced chromosomal and DNA damaged on barley genomes. Due to restriction endonucleases' ability to facilitate damage in chromosomes and DNA, REs have the capability of being used as a new method of mutagenesis to promote the proliferation of mutated plant varieties. = Space-breeding = The ability of plants to develop and thrive is dependent on conditions such as microgravity and cosmic radiation in space. China has been experimenting with this theory by sending seeds into space, testing to see if space flights will cause genetic mutations. Since 1987, China has cultivated 66 mutant varieties from space through their space-breeding program. Chromosomal aberrations greatly increased when seeds were sent into aerospace compared to their earth- bound counterparts. The effect of space flight on seeds depends on their species and variety. For example, space-bred wheat saw a large growth in seed germination in compared to its Earth-bound control, but space-bred rice had no visible advantage compared to its control. For the varieties that were positively mutated by space flight, their growth potential exceeded that of not only their Earth-grown counterparts, but also their irradiated counterparts on Earth. Compared to traditional mutagenic techniques, space- bred mutations have greater efficacy in that they experience positive effects on their first generation of mutation, whereas irradiated crops often see no advantageous mutations in their first generations. Though multiple experiments have shown the positive effects of space flight on seed mutation, there is no clear connection as to what aspect of aerospace has produced such advantageous mutations. There is much speculation around cosmic radiation being the source of chromosomal aberrations, but so far, there has been no concrete evidence of such connection. Though China's space-breeding program has been shown to be very successful, the program requires a large budget and technological support that many other countries are either unwilling or unable to provide, meaning this program is unfeasible outside of China. Due to such restraints, scientists have been trying to replicate space condition on Earth in order to promote the same expedient space-born mutations on Earth. One such replication is a magnetic field-free space (MF), which produces an area with a weaker magnetic field than that of Earth. MF treatment produced mutagenic results, and has been used to cultivate new mutant varieties of rice and alfalfa. Other replications of space conditions include irradiation of seeds by a heavy 7 Li- ion beam or mixed high-energy particles. These space-bred varieties are already being introduced to the public. In 2011, during the National Lotus Flowers Exhibition in China, a mutant lotus, called the \\"Outer Space Sun\\", was shown at the flower show. = Ion beam technology = Ion beams mutate DNA by deleting multiple bases from the genome. Compared to traditional sources of radiation, like gamma rays and X-rays, ion beams have been shown to cause more severe breaks in DNA that are more difficult to weave back together, causing the change in DNA to be more drastic than changes caused by traditional irradiation. Ion beams change DNA in a manner that makes it look vastly different than its original makeup, more so than when traditional irradiation techniques are used. Most experimentation, using ion beam technology, has been conducted in Japan. Notable facilities using this technology are TIARA of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, RIKEN Accelerator Research Facility, and various other Japanese institutions. During the process of ion beam radiation, seeds are wedged between two kapton films and irradiated for roughly two minutes. Mutation frequencies are notably higher for ion beam radiation compared to electron radiation, and the mutation spectrum is broader for ion beam radiation compared to gamma ray radiation. The broader mutation spectrum was revealed through the largely varied amount of flower phenotypes produced by ion beams. Flowers mutated by the ion beams exhibited a variety of colors, patterns, and shapes. Through ion beam radiation, new varieties of plants have been cultivated. These plants had the characteristics of being ultraviolet light-B resistant, disease resistant, and chlorophyll-deficient. Ion beam technology has been used in the discovery of new genes responsible for the creation of more robust plants, but its most prevalent use is commercially for producing new flower phenotypes, like striped chrysanthemums. = Mature pollen treated with gamma radiation = Gamma radiation is used on mature rice pollen to produce parent plants used for crossing. The mutated traits in the parent plants are able to be inherited by their offspring plants. Because rice pollen has a very short lifespan, researchers had to blast gamma rays at cultured spikes from rice plants. Through experimentation, it was revealed that there was a greater variety of mutation in irradiated pollen rather than irradiated dry seeds. Pollen treated with 46Gy of gamma radiation showed an increase in grain size overall and other useful variations. Typically, the length of each grain was longer after the crossing of irradiated parent rice plants. The rice progeny also exhibited a less chalky visage, improving on the appearance of the parent rice plants. This technique was used to develop two new rice cultivars, Jiaohezaozhan and Jiafuzhan, in China. Along with facilitating the creation of these two rice cultivars, the irradiation of mature rice pollen has produced roughly two hundred mutant rice lines. Each of these lines produce rice grains of both a higher quality and larger size. The mutations produced by this technique vary with each generation, meaning further breeding of these mutated plants could produce new mutations. Traditionally, gamma radiation is used on solely adult plants, and not on pollen. The irradiation of mature pollen allows mutant plants to grow without being in direct contact with gamma radiation. This discovery is in contrast to what was previously believed about gamma radiation: that it could only elicit mutations in plants and not pollen.

She is currently serving as the first President of the Kosovo Specialist Chambers ‚Äì a position to which she was appointed in December 2016 for a four-year term and took her office on 12 January 2017.  Mandate at the International Criminal Court  Prior to her appointment to the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, President Trendafilova was elected a Judge of the International Criminal Court with most votes at the first round of elections. During her mandate at the International Criminal Court, she served between 2006 and 2015 as member of Pre-Trial Chambers I, II and III; Presiding Judge of Pre-Trial Chamber II; President of the Pre-Trial Division; ad hoc Judge of the Appeals Division sitting on interlocutory appeals and on the final appeals in the cases of the Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo (on both judgments - on the merits of the criminal case and on reparations for victims) and the Prosecutor v. Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui. She was assigned to various situations and cases before the Court (Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Darfur, Uganda, Kenya, Mali). She also served as a member of the Advisory Committee on Legal Texts and of the Working Group on Lessons Learned.  Notable legal opinions and decisions  Together with her colleagues of Pre-Trial Chamber II, Judge Trendafilova made the landmark decision that saw President Uhuru Kenyatta, his Deputy William Ruto, former Head of Civil Service Francis Muthaura and journalist Joshua Sang committed to trial in January 2012. As a Single Judge, Trendafilova issued innovative decisions in an attempt to optimise the conduct of pre-trial proceedings, including by devising new streamlined systems for the application and participation in the proceedings of victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Ruto and others case; Muthaura and others case and in the Ntaganda case. Judge Trendafilova addressed for the first time at the International Criminal Court the issue whether members of armed groups engaged in a non-international armed conflict may be held accountable for war crimes, in particular rape and sexual slavery, committed against fellow fighters; and whether the war crime of intentionally attacking civilians may be committed through conduct other than the traditional shelling or bombarding, such as by raping, destruction of civilian properties and pillaging towns and villages in the course of military operations. In February 2015, sitting in the Appeals Chamber, Judge Trendafilova dissented from the decision to uphold the Trial Chamber‚Äôs acquittal of Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, a militia leader of commanding fighters who destroyed the village of Bogoro in eastern Congo in 2003, raping and hacking to death some 200 people, including children. The original 2012 trial judgment had been only the second verdict in the court's history and the first time it had cleared a suspect. Judge Trendafilova argued that the Appeals Chamber should have ordered a retrial because of errors by the Trial Chamber, saying that vital evidence was disregarded.  Activities related to legal reform  Ekaterina Trendafilova is active in the field of legal reform. In 2016, she consulted the Parliament of Kazakhstan on possible reforms of the Kazakh criminal justice system in light of the contemporary trends in the field. Between 2004 and 2006, she was appointed expert of the European Commission CARDS Regional Project ‚ÄúEstablishment of an Independent, Reliable and Functioning Judiciary and Enhancing the Judicial Co-Operation in the Western Balkans‚Äù, which involved field missions to Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia with a view to formulating recommendations for judicial reforms. She was an expert with the PHARE Twinning project (Bulgaria‚ÄìAustria) on the ‚ÄúExecution of the Reform Strategy of the Judiciary in Bulgaria. Access to Justice‚Äù. Trendafilova contributed to the legal reform in Bulgaria. In 1998-1999 she was the head of the working group on the reform of the Bulgarian Criminal Procedure Code in line with European and international standards for efficient administration of justice and an effective protection of human rights. She chaired the Criminal Division of the Legislative Consultative Council with the President of the Bulgarian Parliament. Within the purview of the criminal justice reform, Trendafilova was invited to the International Visitor Leadership Program (Criminal Justice Issues), hosted by the US Department of State with working visits to judicial and law enforcement institutions in Washington, New York, Salt Lake City, Denver, San Diego.  Education and domestic experience  Trendafilova completed her PhD in 1984. She was granted a Humboldt (1993-1994) and a Fulbright scholarship (1997). She was a deputy district attorney at the Sofia District Court (1985-1989) as well as a barrister with the Sofia bar (1995-2006). Trendafilova was the representative of Bulgaria with the UN Commission for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (1992-1994). In 2001, Trendafilova was appointed Professor in Criminal Justice at the Faculty of Law, Sofia University ‚ÄúSt Kliment Ohridski‚Äù. She also lectured at ‚ÄúSt. Cyril and Methodius‚Äù, Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria. She made presentations on different topics in the field of criminal law and procedure, international criminal law and criminal justice, human rights, humanitarian law and related legal fields in Japan, USA, Colombia, Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany. Ekaterina Trendafilova is a member of a number of legal associations, including the Editorial Board of Criminal Law Forum and Human Rights Review, the Women with International Societal Expertise, the Bulgarian Fulbright Society, the Bulgarian Alexander von Humboldt Society, the European Correspondents Scientific Committee of the Central International Constats et Perspectives, the Union of Bulgarian Lawyers and was President of the Legal Section of the Union of Bulgarian Scholars.  Publications  Ekaterina Trendafilova is widely published in the field of international and comparative criminal justice, criminal procedure and human rights. She published in Bulgaria and abroad, notably in the USA, France, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, Brazil, Germany and South Africa on standards applicable to transitional justice, including fairness and expeditiousness of the proceedings, criminal procedure, the relationship between the International Criminal Court and African countries and the incorporation of human rights law into the criminal justice system. In 2000, Trendafilova was awarded the ‚ÄúAuthor of the Year‚Äù award for contribution to the legal literature with the monographic paper ‚ÄúThe Amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code from 1999: Theoretical Grounds, Legislative Decisions, Tendencies‚Äù.  Other awards and honours  In 2006 Trendafilova received the Highest Award of the Union of Bulgarian Lawyers and the Award-recognition of the Legal Initiative for Training and Development acknowledging her contribution to the legal reform and education of judges and prosecutors. In 2008, she received the ‚ÄúSpecial Merits and Contribution‚Äù award from the Bulgarian Ministry of Justice, in recognition of her outstanding contribution to Justice and the Rule of Law in the Republic of Bulgaria.

Four of the women were killed in Wichita Falls, Texas and the surrounding counties. One woman was murdered in Fort Worth, approximately a two-hour drive southeast of Wichita Falls. Wardrip's killing spree began at the end of 1984 and lasted until the middle of 1986. All of his female victims were white, were between the ages of 20 and 25, weighed less than 120 lb, and were under 5 and 1/2 feet tall. With the killings occurring across multiple jurisdictions, officials from three law enforcement agencies - the Wichita Falls Police Department, the Wichita County Sheriff's Department and the Archer County Sheriff's Department - initially led isolated murder investigations. These investigations were for three of the murders that occurred within a 5-mile radius of each other. This separation led to multiple news agencies reporting that the isolated investigations delayed Wardrip's capture.\\"Burden of Proof\\" The Dallas Observer Within 72 hours of the May 6, 1986 murder of Tina Kimbrew, Wardrip called authorities and confessed to her murder. He was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison. After serving less than one-third of his sentence, Wardrip was released on parole in December 1997. He was required to wear an ankle monitor allowing authorities to constantly track his location; he was restricted to movements for work, home and church. In 1999, the Wichita County District Attorney's Office reopened the murder cases of the victims that occurred in their jurisdiction. DNA evidence found at the scene of two murders were linked to the same killer. Because Wardrip's murder of Kimbrew occurred in 1986, the lead detective became suspicious that he may have been behind the unsolved murder cases. As Wardrip was out on parole and there was no national database of DNA profiles for violent offenders at that time, authorities immediately launched surveillance of Wardrip and managed to secure a sample of his DNA, which was linked to two victims. He later confessed to the murders of the third and fourth victims. In 1999, at 40 years old, Wardrip was sentenced to death by lethal injection for the first murder, and three life terms for the other three killings. Background Faryion Edward Wardrip was born on March 6, 1959 in Salem, Indiana to George and Diana Wardrip. He was his parents' first born child and has one brother. There are no news articles or television reports of Wardrip experiencing any type of mental or physical abuse during his childhood. He dropped out of high school in the twelfth grade. In 1978, at the age of 19, Wardrip joined the United States National Guard. After 6 years of service, Wardrip was released from the National Guard under a less-than-honorable discharge. The discharge was due to smoking marijuana, disorderly conduct and multiple absences without leave (AWOL). During his military service he was not deployed into combat duty. In March 1983, at 24 years old, he married his first wife, 20-year-old Johnna D. Jackson. The couple had two children together. The marriage was tarnished by Wardrip's drug and alcohol abuse. This same year he worked as a janitor at the Wichita Falls General Hospital and within twelve months he was promoted from janitor to orderly. Due to his addictions, he was unable to maintain employment and was bouncing between jobs. Johnna's parents helped the couple financially by paying their rent and buying their groceries. Tired of Wardrip's lack of responsibility and addictions in December 1985, Johnna separated from Wardrip taking the children with her. She soon filed for divorce which was granted in October 1986. Murders =Terry Sims= Terry Sims, 20 Terry Lee Sims worked as a part-time EKG specialist at Bethania Hospital in Wichita Falls, Texas while attending nearby Midwestern State University. Sims and co-worker Leza Boone had finished working their evening shifts at the hospital at approximately 11:00 pm on December 20, 1984. When leaving work, Sims rode with Boone to a mutual friend's house to exchange Christmas gifts. Sims was planning on spending the night at Boone's residence on Bell Street so Boone could help Sims study for her final exam the following day. Unexpectedly, Boone received a call to return to the hospital to work the midnight shift. She drove Sims to her residence and gave Sims the key to her apartment, dropping her off at approximately 12:30 am on December 21, 1984. At 7:30 a.m. that same morning Boone returned home after working a double shift at the hospital. After repeatedly knocking on the locked front door and receiving no answer, Boone went to the landlord and was given a key to her residence. When she gained entry she saw that the living room had been ransacked. Boone immediately ran back to her landlord's residence asking for help to find her friend Terry. The landlord entered the apartment and found Sims lying on the bathroom floor in a pool of blood. She had been sexually assaulted and stabbed to death. While Boone was away at work, Sims had heard Wardrip causing a disturbance and went outside to investigate. Wardrip lunged at Sims and she ran back into the apartment and locked the door. Wardip targeted Sims for \\"no apparent reason\\" and broke the door down after she locked him out. Wardrip, standing at 6'6\\" and weighing two hundred-twenty pounds, grabbed Sims, at 5'3\\", ninety-four pounds, and assaulted her. Because of her resistance, Wardrip bound the victim's hands with an electrical cord. Sims was estimated to have lived several minutes after the attack was over. Police officers preserved a semen sample and a fingerprint found on Sims' shoe for future analysis. Over a decade later, the print and semen were positively identified to be those of Wardrip. Sims was buried at Crestview Memorial Park in Wichita Falls. =Toni Gibbs= Toni Gibbs, 23 Toni Jean Gibbs, 23, disappeared on January 19, 1985, while employed at Wichita General Hospital. Gibbs was no more than five-feet, one-inch tall and weighed ninety-four pounds. Wardrip came across Gibbs at about six o'clock in the morning, after he had been out walking all night. He knew Gibbs because she was a registered nurse (RN) at the same hospital where he worked as an orderly. Gibbs offered Wardrip a ride and after he got in her car, he began hurling her around and screaming at her. He then forced Gibbs to drive down an isolated dirt road to a field. Two days after her abduction, her car was found within a few miles of the hospital. On February 15, utility workers found her naked body in a field at the southwest corner of West Jentsch Road and Highway 281 in Archer County, one mile south of the Wichita county line, a day after she would have turned 24. Gibbs had been sexually assaulted and stabbed. Gibbs had a total of eight stab wounds: three on her back, three on her chest, and two defensive wounds on her left forearm and thumb. Near her body, police found an abandoned school bus, where her murderer likely conducted the attack. Authorities discovered Gibbs' clothing inside the bus. Gibbs had initially survived the assault and, stripped of her clothing, she had managed to crawl one hundred feet before she died. After the killing Wardrip then abandoned her vehicle, after legally parking it at the intersection of Van Buren and McGregor Streets in Wichita Falls, less than a mile from his residence. Four days after Gibbs's body was discovered, Wardrip quit his job at the Wichita General Hospital. Danny Laughlin, 24, was initially suspected of Gibbs' murder because he often rode his motorcycle near the area where she was killed and because he had met her at a nightclub days before she was killed. He also failed a lie detector test and made suspicious statements. Laughlin was then tried, even though a comparison of Laughlin's DNA with DNA from the semen at the murder scene was unsuccessful and only circumstantial evidence was available. After two days of deliberation, the jury was deadlocked, which resulted in his release from custody. Since only one of the twelve jurors believed Laughlin was guilty, prosecutors decided not to retry Laughlin. Gibbs was buried at the Clayton Cemetery in New Mexico. =Debra Taylor= Debra Taylor, 25 Two months after he murdered Toni Gibbs, Wardrip traveled to Fort Worth, Texas, with the intention of looking for a job. In Fort Worth he met 25 year old Debra Sue Taylor (n√©e Huie), in the early morning hours of March 24, 1985 while at a bar on East Lancaster Street. Taylor had been at the bar with her husband Ken Taylor, but Ken left early because he was tired. Debra remained at the bar. Wardrip approached Taylor and asked her to dance. She accepted his request and the two spent time together in the club. He then asked to drive her home, which she agreed to. While outside, Wardrip attempted to make sexual advances, which were rejected by Taylor. This infuriated Wardrip and he killed Taylor, leaving her body at a construction site in east Fort Worth. When Debra failed to return home by the next morning, she was reported missing by her husband. Her body was found by two construction workers on March 29, 1985. Taylor's murder was not believed to be related to the other four cases, until Wardrip confessed during questioning after his 1999 arrest. Prior to Wardrip's confession, Taylor's husband was believed to be the culprit. He had passed three polygraph tests but was still considered a suspect by police. Suspicions about Taylor had \\"destroyed his life\\" as members of his own and his wife's family \\"turned against him\\". Taylor was buried at Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Park in Fort Worth; date of death is listed as March 24, 1985. =Ellen Blau= Ellen Blau, 21 On September 20, 1985 Wardrip abducted 21 year old Ellen Blau in Wichita Falls. The abduction occurred as Blau was walking alone to her vehicle, after leaving her evening job as a waitress. She was also a student at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls. Once abducted, Wardrip forced Blau to drive to a secluded area where he eventually killed her by strangulation. He stated in a Cold Case Files episode that he had broken her neck.\\"Killer in the County.\\" Cold Case Files. A&E.; New York, New York, 16 April 1999. Television. Leaving her body in the secluded area, he drove her car back into Wichita Falls and abandoned it along with her purse. Her blood was also discovered on the inside of the vehicle. A county road crew employee found Blau's body in a field in Wichita County on October 10, 1985. Once her body was found, it was in a very advanced state of decomposition, to the point where she could only be identified by comparing dental records. She may have been sexually assaulted, as her underwear had been pulled down, but the condition of her remains prevented accurate analysis. No semen samples were available. One of her friends had lived in the same apartment complex as Wardrip and had stated that she felt uncomfortable around him. Blau was buried at Bnai Jacob Memorial Park in New Haven, Connecticut; date of death is listed as September 20, 1985. =Tina Kimbrew= Tina Kimbrew, 21 On May 6, 1986 Wardrip killed 21 year old Tina Elizabeth Kimbrew, a waitress he had recently befriended. He went to her apartment and suffocated her with a pillow because she \\"reminded him of his ex-wife\\". Prior to the discovery of her body, neighbors told police that they had seen a white man, 6 feet 2 inches tall, with dark brown hair and wearing a baseball cap leave the complex. Danny Laughlin (who had been suspected in the death of Toni Gibbs) was ruled out as a suspect because he did not fit this description. A few days later, on May 9, Wardrip called the police from across the state in Galveston, threatening to commit suicide. Once the police arrived he confessed to the murder. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison. He was paroled in December 1997 and he moved to Olney, TX where he remarried and became an active supporter of the local church, gaining a good reputation. He eventually got a job at a screen door factory. Kimbrew was buried at Wilbarger Memorial Park in Vernon. 1999 convictions Polunsky Unit, where Wardrip is held In 1999 Wichita Falls detective John Little began a cold case investigation of the unsolved murders of Terry Sims, Toni Gibbs, and Ellen Blau. DNA recovered from the scenes where Sims and Gibbs were found, were later matched, indicating that both victims had been killed by the same person. Detective Little's investigation revealed a previously unknown link between Wardrip and Blau. One of his fellow officers revealed that while Wardrip was on trial for Tina Kimbrew's murder he admitted to knowing Blau. This lead had not been investigated at the time it emerged. Wardrip himself stated that the agency would have been able to find a suspect much sooner if they had \\"paid a little bit more attention.\\" Detective Little found additional evidence linking Wardrip to the three unsolved murders: Blau had lived one block away from Sims, and Wardrip had been employed as an orderly at the same hospital where Gibbs had worked as a nurse. At the time, police had no DNA sample from Wardrip, so Detective Little used a simple ploy to obtain one. After being paroled from prison for Tina Kimbrew's murder Wardrip was working at a factory. During Wardrip's coffee break, Little approached Wardrip and asked him for the paper cup from which Wardrip had been drinking so that Little could spit out the tobacco which he had been chewing. An analysis of Wardrip's DNA obtained from the coffee cup matched the suspect's DNA in the cases of Terry Sims and Toni Gibbs. Wardrip was arrested, and while he was in custody, he confessed to the murders of Sims, Gibbs, Blau, and the additional murder in Fort Worth of Debra Taylor.Dowling, P. (2002). Sip of Sins [Television series episode]. In Forensic Files. New York, New York: Court TV. In 1999, Wardrip was sentenced to death for the murder of Sims, and three life terms for the other killings. In 2008, a federal magistrate recommended that the death penalty be overturned because Wardrip received ineffective defense in his trial. On June 14, 2011, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling that ordered the State of Texas to either give Wardrip a new sentencing trial or agree to give him a life sentence. The case was sent back to the U.S. District Court for reconsideration. In December 2014, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Wardrip's appeal regarding inadequate representation. Wardrip remains on death row at Polunsky Unit near Livingston.

Effects of AH-1058, A new antiarrhythmic drug, on experimental arrhythmias and cardiac membrane currents. Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology 1999; vol 33:625-632 It is derived from cyproheptadine, a compound with known antiserotonic, antihistaminic and calcium channel blocking properties.Hiroshi K, Makoto S, Kazuhide O, et al. On the ionic mechanism of cyproheptadine-induced bradycardia in a rabbit sinoatrial node preparation. European Journal of Pharmacology 1987; vol 139:307-313 The IUPAC name of AH-1058 is: 4-(5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-1-[E-3-(3-methoxy-2-nitro) phenyl-2-propenyl]piperidine hydrochloride.Takahara A, Sugiyama A, Dohmoto H, et al. Electrophysiological and cardiohemodynamic effects of AH-1058, a new type calcium channel blocker, assessed by the in vivo canine model. Japanese Journal of Pharmacology 2000; vol 83:107-112 Mechanism of Action AH-1058 is a cardioselective L-type calcium channel blocker.Tanaka H, Icikawa T, Matsui S, et al. Calcium channel antagonistic effects of AH-1058, a novel antiarrhythmic drug, on guinea-pig myocardium. Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol 1999; vol 104:13-21 AH-1058 binds to the same sites on the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels as phenylalkylamines (ex. verapamil) and benzothiazepines; both of which are well known calcium channel blockers.Takahara A, Sugiyama A, Yoshimoto R, et al. AH-1058: A novel cardioselective Ca2+ channel blocker. Cardiovascular Drug Reviews 2001; vol 19:279-296 These sites on the alpha-1 subunit differ from the active site of the calcium channel, meaning AH-1058 binds L-type calcium channels allosterically to alter activity. In addition AH-1058 appears to interact with multiple states of L-type calcium channels (i.e. resting and inactive) to suppress calcium currents. A minor effect on sodium channels at higher concentrations has also been seen, but these effects appear to vary between species. Effects The calcium blocking activity of AH-1058 can decrease ventricular contractility, heart rate, and conductance through the atrioventricular node.Takahara A, Sugiyama A, Dohmoto H, et al. Comparison of cardiovascular effects of a new calcium channel blocker AH-1058 with those of verapamil assessed in blood-perfused canine heart preparations. Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology 2000; vol 35:741-748 In addition AH-1058 has been shown to decrease systolic blood pressure while minimally affecting total peripheral vascular resistance and leaving diastolic blood pressure unaffected.Takahara A, Dohmoto H, Yoshimoto R, et al. Utilization of telemetry system to assess the cardiovascular profile of AH-1058, a new cardioselective calcium channel blocker, in conscious dogs. Japanese Journal of Pharmacology 2001; vol 85:331-334 The order of the potency of the effects AH-1058 has on the cardiovascular system is: ventricular contraction > coronary blood flow >> atrioventricular conduction > sinoatrial automaticity (level of sinoatrial self-activation). Clinical Uses AH-1058 displays characteristics of Class IV antiarrhythmics (L-type calcium channel blockers). Class I antiarrhythmic (sodium channel blocker) characteristics have also been seen, but the effect AH-1058 has on sodium channels is variable and unknown. Some proposed uses for AH-1058 include the treatment of angina pectoris, stenosis of the outflow tract from obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmias.Takahara A, Dohmoto H, Yoshimoto R, et al. Cardiovascular action of a cardioselective calcium channel blocker AH-1058 in conscious dogs assessed by telemetry. European Journal of Pharmacology 2001; vol 413: 101-108 Treatment of these conditions (long term and short term) is possible due to the cardioselective nature of AH-1058 and the ability of AH-1058 to inhibit calcium channels and thus reduce cardiac contractility and energy consumption. Efficacy Studies have compared AH-1058 to widely used and clinically available drugs such as verapamil (a Class IV antiarrhythmic drug) and atenolol (a Beta Blocker)Ram CV. Beta blockers in hypertension. American Journal of Cardiology 2010; vol 106:1819-1825 to assess the efficacy of AH-1058. The effects of AH-1058 are slower to onset but longer-lasting than those of verapamil and atenolol. In addition, the minimal effects AH-1058 has on total peripheral vascular resistance is an important advantage over atenolol and verapamil, as these drugs an be taken long term for disease management. Lastly AH-1058 displays a greater selectivity for cardiac tissue over verapamil and atenolol with the same level of potency as verapamil in vitro.Dohmoto H, Takahara A, Uneyama H, et al. Cardiac calcium blocking effects of the cyproheptadine derivative AH-1058 in isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes.

She was a Tennessee circuit court judge, a member of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, and a justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court before being removed from office in a judicial retention election.About Penny J. White, University of Tennessee College of Law website, accessed April 20, 2011Justices of the Supreme Court of Tennessee , Tennessee Supreme Court Historical Society, accessed April 22, 2011 She is the only Tennessee judge ever to lose a judicial retention election under the Tennessee Plan.Skyler Swisher, Tenn. chief justice: Selection process for judges is working, The Daily Herald (Maury County, Tennessee), April 17, 2011Ron Ramsey backs bill requiring judicial elections to force system's hand, DNJ.com (The Daily News Journal, Murfreesboro, Tennessee), April 1, 2011 Early life and education White was born in Kingsport, Tennessee in 1956.John R. Vile (2003), Great American judges: an encyclopedia, Pages 306-307. She attended East Tennessee State University (ETSU), graduating with a B.S. degree in 1978. At ETSU she was the first female president of the Student Government Association.White featured in 'Women of History in the Region' Lecture Series, East Tennessee State University News & Events, April 10, 2001 After graduation, she went on to study law at the University of Tennessee College of Law, where she was awarded the J.D. degree in 1981, and Georgetown University Law Center, where she was awarded an LL.M. degree in 1987.Penny J. White curriculum vitae, University of Tennessee College of Law website, accessed April 20, 2011 Legal and judicial career White engaged in the private practice of law in Johnson City, Tennessee, from 1981 to 1983 and from 1985 to 1990. From 1983 to 1985 she served as supervising attorney and clinical instructor in the Georgetown University Law Center Criminal Justice Clinic. Penny White impressed Justice Scalia and the US Supreme Court when she appeared before them at the age of 32. The New Yorker article on Scalia note: \\"In a 1988 speech, Justice Harry Blackmun, who retired in 1994, recalled how Scalia had grilled a lawyer named Penny White, a thirty-two-year-old solo practitioner from Johnson City, Tennessee. He \\"picked on her and picked on her and picked on her, and she gave it back to him,\\" Blackmun said. \\"Finally, at the end of the case we walked off, and Nino said the only thing he could say: 'Wasn't she good? Wasn't she good?' The rest of us were completely silent. We knew she was very good.\\" In 1990, she won election to a judgeship in Tennessee's First Judicial Circuit. In 1992 she left the circuit judgeship when Tennessee Governor Ned McWherter appointed her to the state's Court of Criminal Appeals. She served on that court until 1994, when McWherter selected her to fill a vacancy on the Tennessee Supreme Court. She became the second woman ever to serve on the state's highest court.Colman McCarthy, Injustice Claims a Tennessee Judge, The Washington Post, November 26, 1996. Page C11. =Vote on judicial retention= White became a subject of controversy in 1996 when she voted with the court majority in the 3-2 decision in the case of State v. Odom. That June 3, 1996 decision upheld a conviction for the rape and murder of an elderly woman, but overturned a death sentence in the case on the grounds that the combination of rape with murder did not meet the requirements for the death penalty because the rape did not cause the murder to be \\"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse beyond that necessary to produce death.\\" It was the only death penalty decision that White ever participated in as a member of the state supreme court.Richard Carelli (Associated Press), \\"Does electing judges politicize the death penalty?\\" Published by the Daily Union (Junction City, Kansas), December 2, 1996. In a law review article published several years later, White wrote that Tennessee law at the time of the case allowed capital punishment and that she would have voted to affirm a death sentence \\"that was imposed in accordance with the law.\\" While a member of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, as well as the Tennessee Supreme Court White was criticized for at least three opinions on capital murder cases. Suzanne Collins, a 19 year old female Marine was assaulted, kidnapped, beaten, and ultimately killed by having a 31 inch tree branch thrust between her legs so deeply it penetrated her vital organs and punctured a lung. Sedley Alley was convicted and sentenced to death. Tennessee State Trooper Doug Tripp was shot 12 times in the head and torso in two separate volleys from a suspect while sitting in his cruiser. 78 year old Mina Ethel Johnson was raped, and repeatedly stabbed during an attack by Richard Odom. In the Collins and Johnson cases White's opinion was that these murders did not meet the definition of \\"especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel\\". In the Trooper Tripp case, White held there was not sufficient evidence of premeditation, and the charge was reduced to 2nd degree murder. Trooper Tripp's killer was paroled after 17 years. As a recent appointee, White was the only member of the court who was subject to a retention vote in that year's election, and she was targeted for defeat by victims' rights advocates, the Tennessee Conservative Union, and death penalty proponents who opposed the decision. White was restrained from campaigning on her own behalf by the judicial code of ethics, but her opponents \\"flooded the state\\" with materials urging her defeat. One mailing urged voters to \\"Vote for capital punishment by voting NO on August 1 for Supreme Court Justice Penny White.\\"Ted Gottfried (2002), The death penalty: justice or legalized murder?.

Judge White's advocacy campaign, \\"People To Retain Justice White\\" raised over 10 times the funds of their counterparts, yet White was recalled during the election. The defeat of White's judicial retention election was decried by people concerned that election of judges politicizes the judiciary, as well as by opponents of the death penalty. In a speech before the American Bar Association two days after White's defeat, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens stated that he considered the popular election of judges to be \\"profoundly unwise.\\" He stated: \\"A campaign promise to be 'tough on crime' or 'enforce the death penalty' is evidence of bias that should disqualify the candidate from sitting in criminal cases.\\" The political nature of White's removal from the court has been likened to the earlier election defeat of California Chief Justice Rose Bird. When Adolpho A. Birch, who was chief justice of the court at the time of the State v. Odom decision, came up for a judicial retention vote in 1998, death penalty supporters campaigned for his removal. However, he was the beneficiary of a public awareness campaign on the importance of judicial retention elections that was mounted by the state's bar association, Farm Bureau, and League of Women Voters in Tennessee, and he retained his seat with 54 percent of the vote. Law school faculty career After leaving the state supreme court, White held one-year law school visiting professorships at Washington and Lee University (1997-1998), West Virginia University (1998-1999), and the University of Denver (1999-2000). In 2000 she joined the faculty of the University of Tennessee College of Law, where she is Elvin E. Overton Distinguished Professor of Law and directs the Center for Advocacy and Legal Clinic.

Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings.. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are. Integer sorting algorithms including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort are widely used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending on a combination of the number of items to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm. General considerations =Models of computation= Time bounds for integer sorting algorithms typically depend on three parameters: the number of data values to be sorted, the magnitude of the largest possible key to be sorted, and the number of bits that can be represented in a single machine word of the computer on which the algorithm is to be performed. Typically, it is assumed that ; that is, that machine words are large enough to represent an index into the sequence of input data, and also large enough to represent a single key.. Integer sorting algorithms are usually designed to work in either the pointer machine or random access machine models of computing. The main difference between these two models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory read and write operations, with unit cost per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation.The question of whether integer multiplication or table lookup operations should be permitted goes back to ; see also . Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.; comment in ; ; ; . showed that in some cases the multiplications or table lookups required by some integer sorting algorithms could be replaced by customized operations that would be more easily implemented in hardware but that are not typically available on general- purpose computers. improved on this by showing how to replace these special operations by the bit field manipulation instructions already available on Pentium processors. In external memory models of computing, no known integer sorting algorithm is faster than comparison sorting. Researchers have shown that, in these models, restricted classes of algorithms that are limited in how they manipulate their keys cannot be faster than comparison sorting, and that an integer sorting algorithm that is faster than comparison sorting would imply the falsity of a standard conjecture in network coding. =Sorting versus integer priority queues= A priority queue is a data structure for maintaining a collection of items with numerical priorities, having operations for finding and removing the item with the minimum priority value. Comparison- based priority queues such as the binary heap take logarithmic time per update, but other structures such as the van Emde Boas tree or bucket queue may be faster for inputs whose priorities are small integers. These data structures can be used in the selection sort algorithm, which sorts a collection of elements by repeatedly finding and removing the smallest element from the collection, and returning the elements in the order they were found. A priority queue can be used to maintain the collection of elements in this algorithm, and the time for this algorithm on a collection of elements can be bounded by the time to initialize the priority queue and then to perform find and remove operations. For instance, using a binary heap as a priority queue in selection sort leads to the heap sort algorithm, a comparison sorting algorithm that takes time. Instead, using selection sort with a bucket queue gives a form of pigeonhole sort, and using van Emde Boas trees or other integer priority queues leads to other fast integer sorting algorithms. Instead of using an integer priority queue in a sorting algorithm, it is possible to go the other direction, and use integer sorting algorithms as subroutines within an integer priority queue data structure. used this idea to show that, if it is possible to perform integer sorting in time per key, then the same time bound applies to the time per insertion or deletion operation in a priority queue data structure. Thorup's reduction is complicated and assumes the availability of either fast multiplication operations or table lookups, but he also provides an alternative priority queue using only addition and Boolean operations with time per operation, at most multiplying the time by an iterated logarithm. =Usability= The classical integer sorting algorithms of pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort are widely used and practical.; . Much of the subsequent research on integer sorting algorithms has focused less on practicality and more on theoretical improvements in their worst case analysis, and the algorithms that come from this line of research are not believed to be practical for current 64-bit computer architectures, although experiments have shown that some of these methods may be an improvement on radix sorting for data with 128 or more bits per key.. Additionally, for large data sets, the near-random memory access patterns of many integer sorting algorithms can handicap them compared to comparison sorting algorithms that have been designed with the memory hierarchy in mind.. Integer sorting provides one of the six benchmarks in the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems Discrete Mathematics benchmark suite,DARPA HPCS Discrete Mathematics Benchmarks, Duncan A. Buell, University of South Carolina, retrieved 2011-04-20. and one of eleven benchmarks in the NAS Parallel Benchmarks suite. Practical algorithms Pigeonhole sort or counting sort can both sort data items having keys in the range from to in time . In pigeonhole sort (often called bucket sort), pointers to the data items are distributed to a table of buckets, represented as collection data types such as linked lists, using the keys as indices into the table. Then, all of the buckets are concatenated together to form the output list.. Although also describe a version of this sorting algorithm, the version they describe is adapted to inputs where the keys are real numbers with a known distribution, rather than to integer sorting. Counting sort uses a table of counters in place of a table of buckets, to determine the number of items with each key. Then, a prefix sum computation is used to determine the range of positions in the sorted output at which the values with each key should be placed. Finally, in a second pass over the input, each item is moved to its key's position in the output array., 8.2 Counting Sort, pp. 168‚Äì169. Both algorithms involve only simple loops over the input data (taking time ) and over the set of possible keys (taking time ), giving their overall time bound. Radix sort is a sorting algorithm that works for larger keys than pigeonhole sort or counting sort by performing multiple passes over the data. Each pass sorts the input using only part of the keys, by using a different sorting algorithm (such as pigeonhole sort or counting sort) that is suited only for small keys. To break the keys into parts, the radix sort algorithm computes the positional notation for each key, according to some chosen radix; then, the part of the key used for the th pass of the algorithm is the th digit in the positional notation for the full key, starting from the least significant digit and progressing to the most significant. For this algorithm to work correctly, the sorting algorithm used in each pass over the data must be stable: items with equal digits should not change positions with each other. For greatest efficiency, the radix should be chosen to be near the number of data items, . Additionally, using a power of two near as the radix allows the keys for each pass to be computed quickly using only fast binary shift and mask operations. With these choices, and with pigeonhole sort or counting sort as the base algorithm, the radix sorting algorithm can sort data items having keys in the range from to in time .; , 8.3 Radix Sort, pp. 170‚Äì173. Theoretical algorithms Many integer sorting algorithms have been developed whose theoretical analysis shows them to behave better than comparison sorting, pigeonhole sorting, or radix sorting for large enough combinations of the parameters defining the number of items to be sorted, range of keys, and machine word size. Which algorithm has the best performance depends on the values of these parameters. However, despite their theoretical advantages, these algorithms are not an improvement for the typical ranges of these parameters that arise in practical sorting problems. =Algorithms for small keys= A Van Emde Boas tree may be used as a priority queue to sort a set of keys, each in the range from to , in time . This is a theoretical improvement over radix sorting when is sufficiently large. However, in order to use a Van Emde Boas tree, one either needs a directly addressable memory of words, or one needs to simulate it using a hash table, reducing the space to linear but making the algorithm be randomized. Another priority queue with similar performance (including the need for randomization in the form of hash tables) is the Y-fast trie of . A more sophisticated technique with a similar flavor and with better theoretical performance was developed by . They observed that each pass of radix sort can be interpreted as a range reduction technique that, in linear time, reduces the maximum key size by a factor of ; instead, their technique reduces the key size to the square root of its previous value (halving the number of bits needed to represent a key), again in linear time. As in radix sort, they interpret the keys as two-digit base- numbers for a base that is approximately . They then group the items to be sorted into buckets according to their high digits, in linear time, using either a large but uninitialized direct addressed memory or a hash table. Each bucket has a representative, the item in the bucket with the largest key; they then sort the list of items using as keys the high digits for the representatives and the low digits for the non-representatives. By grouping the items from this list into buckets again, each bucket may be placed into sorted order, and by extracting the representatives from the sorted list the buckets may be concatenated together into sorted order. Thus, in linear time, the sorting problem is reduced to another recursive sorting problem in which the keys are much smaller, the square root of their previous magnitude. Repeating this range reduction until the keys are small enough to bucket sort leads to an algorithm with running time . A complicated randomized algorithm of in the word RAM model of computation allows these time bounds to be reduced even farther, to . =Algorithms for large words= An integer sorting algorithm is said to be non-conservative if it requires a word size that is significantly larger than .; . As an extreme instance, if , and all keys are distinct, then the set of keys may be sorted in linear time by representing it as a bitvector, with a 1 bit in position when is one of the input keys, and then repeatedly removing the least significant bit.. The non-conservative packed sorting algorithm of uses a subroutine, based on Ken Batcher's bitonic sorting network, for merging two sorted sequences of keys that are each short enough to be packed into a single machine word. The input to the packed sorting algorithm, a sequence of items stored one per word, is transformed into a packed form, a sequence of words each holding multiple items in sorted order, by using this subroutine repeatedly to double the number of items packed into each word. Once the sequence is in packed form, Albers and Hagerup use a form of merge sort to sort it; when two sequences are being merged to form a single longer sequence, the same bitonic sorting subroutine can be used to repeatedly extract packed words consisting of the smallest remaining elements of the two sequences. This algorithm gains enough of a speedup from its packed representation to sort its input in linear time whenever it is possible for a single word to contain keys; that is, when for some constant . =Algorithms for few items= Pigeonhole sort, counting sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting all work best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large relative to the number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words. An early result in this direction was provided by using the cell-probe model of computation (an artificial model in which the complexity of an algorithm is measured only by the number of memory accesses it performs). Building on their work, described two data structures, the Q-heap and the atomic heap, that are implementable on a random access machine. The Q-heap is a bit-parallel version of a binary trie, and allows both priority queue operations and successor and predecessor queries to be performed in constant time for sets of items, where is the size of the precomputed tables needed to implement the data structure. The atomic heap is a B-tree in which each tree node is represented as a Q-heap; it allows constant time priority queue operations (and therefore sorting) for sets of items. provide a randomized algorithm called signature sort that allows for linear time sorting of sets of up to items at a time, for any constant . As in the algorithm of Kirkpatrick and Reisch, they perform range reduction using a representation of the keys as numbers in base for a careful choice of . Their range reduction algorithm replaces each digit by a signature, which is a hashed value with bits such that different digit values have different signatures. If is sufficiently small, the numbers formed by this replacement process will be significantly smaller than the original keys, allowing the non-conservative packed sorting algorithm of to sort the replaced numbers in linear time. From the sorted list of replaced numbers, it is possible to form a compressed trie of the keys in linear time, and the children of each node in the trie may be sorted recursively using only keys of size , after which a tree traversal produces the sorted order of the items. =Trans-dichotomous algorithms= introduced the transdichotomous model of analysis for integer sorting algorithms, in which nothing is assumed about the range of the integer keys and one must bound the algorithm's performance by a function of the number of data values alone. Alternatively, in this model, the running time for an algorithm on a set of items is assumed to be the worst case running time for any possible combination of values of and . The first algorithm of this type was Fredman and Willard's fusion tree sorting algorithm, which runs in time ; this is an improvement over comparison sorting for any choice of and . An alternative version of their algorithm that includes the use of random numbers and integer division operations improves this to . Since their work, even better algorithms have been developed. For instance, by repeatedly applying the Kirkpatrick‚ÄìReisch range reduction technique until the keys are small enough to apply the Albers‚ÄìHagerup packed sorting algorithm, it is possible to sort in time ; however, the range reduction part of this algorithm requires either a large memory (proportional to ) or randomization in the form of hash tables.. showed how to sort in randomized time . Their technique involves using ideas related to signature sorting to partition the data into many small sublists, of a size small enough that signature sorting can sort each of them efficiently. It is also possible to use similar ideas to sort integers deterministically in time and linear space.. Using only simple arithmetic operations (no multiplications or table lookups) it is possible to sort in randomized expected time or deterministically in time for any constant .

It is also reported from Lake County. Its exact abundance is not known because of the lack of recent comprehensive surveys. In 2000 there were seventeen occurrences. This is a rhizomatous perennial herb growing erect, hairy, square-edged stems up to about half a meter tall. The oppositely arranged leaves are up to 7 centimeters long. The flower has tubular purplish corollas about a centimeter long, with lips marked with white. This is a member of the flora in hardwood forests with sandy or silty substrates over limestone rock. The forests are dominated by magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), live oak (Quercus virginiana), water oak (Quercus nigra), winged elm (Ulmus alata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata). Other plants in the understory include hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), and yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria). The main threat to this rare plant is habitat destruction. Much of its forest habitat has been lost to residential and agricultural development and limestone mining. Remaining habitat is degraded by the presence of invasive plant species, particularly skunkvine (Paederia foetida) and air potato (Dioscorea bulbifera), which form a thick groundcover that chokes out native plants. The construction and maintenance of roads also threaten the plant and its habitat.

It is found worldwide in regions with moist growing seasons. Description Haralson with its typical peel coloration from sooty blotch and flyspeck Sooty blotch and flyspeck is a descriptive term for a condition of darkly pigmented blemishes and smudges caused by a number of different fungi affecting fruit including apples, pear, persimmon, banana, papaya, and several other cultivated tree and vine crops. The greenish black coating resembling soot or flyspeck-like dots grow into irregular stains and blotches during the summer or growing season. They can grow into each other and may cover the entire fruit surface. Frequently blotches run down in a track resembling tears (German: \\"Regenfleckenkrankheit\\"). The blotches can be removed by vigorous rubbing or be scratched off revealing a normal peel. Symptoms can be seen particularly well when apples are light or green colored. Late varieties are more susceptible, because the disease builds over a longer growing period.Ru√üflecken Kompetenzzentrum Obstbau-Bodensee in Bavendorf (KOB), not dated, retrieved 25 October 2015 Risk factors Moist and cool weather favors the infection. Orchards with shade or regions near bodies of water with frequent morning dew are especially prone to disease. Infections can occur from June until autumn. Secondary infections are caused by conidia, which are transported by wind and rain onto other developing fruit. The first visible signs of SBFS colonies appear about 3 weeks after infection. Biology Microscopically, the flyspeck-like spots and sooty blemishes are fungal mycelium adhering to fruit. The fungi live as saprophytes on the wax layer surface of apples and do not invade the peel. The hyphae, fruiting bodies, and survival structures of these fungi become melanized over time. SBFS fungi also grow on the surfaces of stems, twigs, leaves, and fruit of a wide range of wild plants. =History of discovery= In an 1832 paper written in Latin and published in Philadelphia, Ludwig Schweinitz described the first sooty blotch species as a fungus he named 'Dothidea pomigena'. It remained the sole species established as a cause until the beginning of the 1990s. In 1920, sooty blotch and flyspeck were mentioned together for the first time, blotch caused by Dothidea, renamed as Gloeodes pomigena and flyspeck caused by Schizothyrium pomi, respectively. Over the next 80 years various different looks of mycelia, that is morphologies were described. By the end of the 20th century three more fungal species had been identified as causes of sooty blotch on North Carolina apples, still based on their morphological type: Peltaster fructicola, Geastrumia polystigmatis and Leptodontium elatius. The authors broke ground after 160 years of \\"confusion\\", stating that \\"sooty blotch fungi are difficult to isolate due to many contaminating microorganisms on the surface of plant parts\\". Also, fruiting structures -a major part of morphological identification- are rare on apple peels. The authors went back to the original historical deposits at the herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and found no conidia. They coined the term 'apple sooty blotch complex' for this group of fungi, which they suspected would include more. As soon as DNA sequence-based methods were used, many more fungi were found and new species and genera described. A sample from nine orchards in four Midwestern states near the cities of Indianola, Pella, Iowa Falls in Iowa, Rockford, Illinois, Simpson and Chester in Illinois, Mooresville and New Franklin in Missouri and New Munster, Wisconsin grew 422 isolates. Their 1 month old DNA was extracted and two regions, ITS1 and 28S ribosomal RNA sequenced.Parsimony analysis, bootstrapping and the minimum evolution principle led to groups of species, further described by conidial and colony morphology. The species were re-inoculated into apples grown at an Iowa State University research station in Gilbert, Iowa, re-isolated, sequenced, and morphology compared. Thirty isolates fulfilled Koch‚Äôs postulates as new species, all Dothideomycetes, 27 were within Dothideales, one was within Pleosporales and two with undetermined ordinal level. Only 2 species (Peltaster fructicola and Zygophiala jamaicensis) had previously been associated with SBFS A 2008 publication of the same sample plus a 2005 sample of 30 more orchards in 10 eastern U.S. states, (39 US apple orchards in 14 states) speciated by DNA- and phylogenetic analyses reported 58 putative species belonging to the Dothideomycetes, 52 of which were Capnodiales, and 36 were part of the Mycosphaerellaceae. Thus the SBFS species diversity had been underestimated by more than tenfold. The number of species per orchard varied from 2 to 15, with a higher diversity the longer an orchard had not been sprayed with fungicide.with blotch and flyspeck signs, reported four species of Zygophiala (Schizothyriaceae, Capnodiales), three of them newly identified. Schizothyrium pomi, Peltaster fructicola, and Pseudocercosporella sp. RH1, were found in nearly every geographic region. Species, such as Stomiopeltis sp. RS5.2, Phialophora sessilis, and Geastrumia polystigmatis, were found only in certain regions, leading to the conclusion that SBFS species differ geographically. Since then, slow-growing epiphytic fungi often belonging to the Capnodiales have been identified (Gleason et al. 2011), and a new species in 2014, Peltaster cerophilus from Europe. =Diversity= Most fungi are part of the Ascomycetes. The composition of the fungal complex varies depending on the region. Their complete life cycle is as of yet unknown. The fungi are hibernating on wild plants like willow, ash or brambles, which are the locus of primary infections. Whether fungi stay within apple orchards is unknown. They probably thrive on apple juice, which exits through minute tears of the cuticula during growth. Flyspeck disease is caused by Schizothyrium pomi. It causes sharply demarcated grey blotches consisting of many small black flyspeck like dots. They can be rubbed off like sooty blotch, but no tear formation occurs. Fruit develop normally. Flyspeck frequently occurs in older trees with light colored peels (Golden Delicious, etc.). Because of their similarity the two diseases are often combined as sooty blotch and flyspeck (\\"Regenfleckenkrankheit\\" in German). Effect The blotches are cosmetic damage \\"unacceptable to consumers\\" and downgrade fruit from premium fresh- market grade to processing use, i.e. reduce its market value, but leaf and fruit development are not affected. Control Preventive measures are pruning which allows light and air to enter the tree, to achieve fast drying. Strong growth within the root area dams up moisture and facilitates infection. A prognostic model called Sooty Blotch RIMpro has been developed, which still awaits validation. Similar to the apple scab model it numerically grades risk and degree of infection and can serve as a warning system. It allows conventional growers to spray more targeted. The parameters for calculation are wetness of leaves, amount of rain fall and temperature.RIMpro forecast model \\"Sooty Blotch\\" Fruitwebinfo, not dated, retrieved 25 October 2015 Conventional orchards that spray fungicides against apple scab, treat soot blotch and flyspeck at the same time. Therefore, the problem is not seen in conventional non-resistant varieties. However, scab-resistant varieties, which are not sprayed frequently show the infection. In organic orchards, spraying 4‚Äì5 with lime sulphur or coco soap during the main infectious periods is recommended.

Within Delhi, due to its channelization for flood control purposes, it is now erroneously called \\"Najafgarh drain\\" or \\"Najafgarh nullah.\\" It gets this name from the once famous and huge Najafgarh Jheel (lake) near the town of Najafgarh in southwest Delhi and within urbanized Delhi. It is the Indian capital‚Äôs most polluted water body due to direct inflow of untreated sewage from surrounding populated areas. A January 2005 report by the Central Pollution Control Board classifies this drain, with 13 other highly polluted wetlands, under category ‚Äò‚ÄòD‚Äô‚Äô for assessing the water quality of wetlands in wildlife habitats.Blot across the Capital: Najafgarh most polluted, Sunday, 10 July 2005, The Indian ExpressEnvironment minister raises a stink over Najafgarh jheel, 22 February 2005, The Indian ExpressNajafgarh basin Delhi‚Äôs most polluted area, 25 Dec 2009, The Indian ExpressNajafgarh drain 11th among highly polluted industrial clusters, 25 Dec 2009, The Times of IndiaNajafgarh drain causes less pollution in Yamuna now , 4 July 2006, The Indian Express This drain was widened as a flood control drain linking the Najafgarh lake to the river Yamuna, thus completely draining the once huge and ecologically rich Najafgarh Lake, famous for its wetland ecosystem, waterbirds and wildlife. Classification and naming Within the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), this channelized waterway‚Äîmisclassified, misnamed as a mere drain (Najafgarh drain or nullah)--is, in fact, the continuation of the Sahibi River and an elongation of the Najafgarh jheel Lake. During the 1960s and before, the rain-fed Sahibi River, which originates in the Jaipur District of Rajasthan, passing through Alwar District in Rajasthan and Gurgaon District in Haryana, entered Delhi near Dhansa and spilled its overflow in the Najafgarh Lake basin. This overflow created a seasonal lake; an area of more than was submerged in some seasons. This water then continued to flow on the other side, forming a tributary of the River Yamuna. In the following decades, this Sahibi River flow reaching the Dhansa regulators was channelized by digging out a wide drain and connecting it directly to the River Yamuna. This channelization also completely drained off the seasonal Najafgarh Jheel that had formed there previously. The channelized drain from Dhansa regulators to Keshopur Bus Depot on Outer Ring Road is wide with thick and high embankments. A vast amount of water is retained in this widened drain by closing the Kakrola regulators under Najafgarh Road to recharge the local ground watertable; hence it acts like an elongated lake as well.Flood Problem due to Sahibi River, Department of Irrigation and Flood Control, Government of NCT of Delhi, India.

Due to the rich wildlife observed in and around the less polluted stretch of the drain outside of congested populated areas, it has been proposed as a bird sanctuary for Delhi.DTTDC to develop bird sanctuary near Najafgarh , 12 January 2003, The Indian ExpressMigratory birds are giving Delhi the go-by, 17 January 2010, The HinduNajafgarh jheel may chirp again, 20 August 2006, The Indian Express The wetland ecosystem and wildlife habitat on several kilometers of less polluted Najafgarh drain in rural Delhi before entering the main city including the former Najafgarh lake or Najafgarh jheel area is very important habitat to migratory waterbirds as well as local wildlife and has been earmarked to be declared a bird sanctuary for Delhi. The area came to be recognized as an important wildlife habitat after a local naturalist studying the area during 1986‚Äì88 called attention to it recommending it to be conserved as a bird sanctuary after which the Delhi wildlife department posted 16 guards in the area to control illegal bird hunters including diplomats from various international embassies located in Delhi, India's capital. Delhi Administration officials were tasked with declaring about stretch of the drain in rural Delhi, including where it passes through the core area of the now drained Najafgarh Lake, \\"protected\\" under the \\"Wildlife Act\\" after Lt.-Governor of Delhi Mr. H.L. Kapur was invited to the area for touring the site where he also heard accounts of local villagers about the rampant illegal hunting of waterbirds that went on here every year.

Bird-watchers and nature-lovers can view the wildlife and waterbirds occurring on the drain from vehicles by driving on this road and stopping intermittently and going down to the waters edge. As the width of the drain is limited the flocks of waterfowl and other waterbirds in the drain can be easily observed from the drain's edges and this same fact makes the birds much more vulnerable to hunting as they remain in easy reach of the poacher's shotguns and the nets and traps set for them by local villagers and professional trappers. Recharging, irrigation The continuous widening of the Najafgarh drain since the 1960s led to the complete draining of the once vast and rich Najafgarh lake, jheel or marsh which directly affected the ground water table in the entire surrounding region as all the rain water after yearly monsoons that used to collect in the vast lake basin in previous years now ran off swiftly through the widened drain into river Yamuna in which it outfalls, this has been affecting the entire climate of the region as well making the region more arid and creating water shortages for the purpose of irrigation or human consumption for the people of Delhi and surrounding regions. Currently the drain is so wide and deep that it acts as an elongated lake in its own right and can hold and store a lot of rain water which can be regulated through regulators built into it at intervals. Maintaining of proper water-level in the drain and storage of rainwater in it during the summer months leads to recharging of ground water tableGroundwater to be recharged at Najafgarh, Mungeshwar drains, by Teena Thacker, New Delhi, 9 March 2007.

Farmers owning farmlands bordering the drain in rural Delhi directly use pipes and hoses to pump water from the drain for irrigation.[Delhi tightens belt to cope with drought], PTI, 2 Aug 2002, The Times of India Newspaper Fishing The relatively cleaner portion of the drain in rural southwest Delhi before it enters densely populated and badly polluted area at Vikaspuri also attracts some small scale local village fishermen, occasionally one can be seen casting his line or net in the waters or floating on a black inflated truck tire tube spreading his fishing net across the breadth of the drain. A fishing license is needed to catch fish legally in Delhi waters. Water hyacinth overgrowth The water hyacinth, an introduced invasive species of fast growing floating plants completely clogs the open water surface of the drain in many areas annually and lot of funds and labour is employed by the flood control department to clear it some what to keep the water flow uninterrupted. The removing of the water hyacinth by laborers also opens up the water surface for birds and migratory waterfowl that take refuge here every winter. Covering for development There is a development scheme in the works where Najafgarh drain will be covered by the Flood Department from Vijay Nagar, Delhi to Hakikat Nagar and on the covered area shops will be built.[‚ÄòPart of Najafgarh drain to be covered‚Äô], by Special Correspondent, New Delhi, 12 September 2009, The Hindu Newspaper. Accessed on 4 October 2012 Najafgarh lake, marsh or jheel Najafgarh lake, Najafgarh marsh or Najafgarh jheel (Jheel in Hindi means a lake) used to be a vast lake in the south west of Delhi in India near the town of Najafgarh from which it takes its name, it was connected to the river Yamuna by a natural shallow nullah or drain called the Najafgarh nullah. However, after the 1960s the Flood Control Department of Delhi kept widening the Najafgarh drain in the pretext of saving Delhi from floods and eventually quickly drained the once huge and ecologically rich Najafgarh lake completely. Rainwater accumulating in the Najafgarh lake or jheel basin had been recorded to have occupied more than 300 square kilometers in many years before its unfortunate draining. However, with recent advances in ecological understanding it has become clear that draining of this vast lake affected the entire climate of this important region that is India's capital territory and its neighborhood. The draining of the lake completely also caused the watertable in the entire area to go down and the area becoming arid. There have been some plans since to at least resurrect a much smaller lake in the area. Most of the Najafgarh jheel basin lands have increased many folds in their value owing to them coming within Delhi, India's capital territory and are under ownership of farmers who may want to make a fast buck selling them to developers who want to convert the former lake basin into housing complexes as has already been happening with major housing colonies coming up in the region. If Najafgarh drain, which was built to drain the original Najafgarh lake or jheel, ever breaches its wide embankments it will flood these developed lands owing to them spread all over the former low lying jheel or lake basin. =Before draining, a vast lake= Before the unfortunate complete draining of this lake in the 1960s by widening of the Najafgarh drain by the Flood control and irrigation department of Delhi the lake in many years filled up a depression more than in rural Delhi, It had an extremely rich wetland ecosystem forming a refuge for vast quantities of waterbirds and local wildlife. The lake was one of the last habitats of the famed and endangered Siberian Crane which has all but vanished from the Indian subcontinent now. Till before independence many British colonial Officers and dignitaries came in large parties for waterfowl hunting every season.Najafgarh marsh: \\"The (Najafgarh) marsh was a favored duck-shoot ground of the British, but was eventually drained out into the Najafgarh Nallah.\\" Strategy Framework for Delhi beyond the Commonwealth Games 2010 , BY DANNY CHERIAN, 2004[A Guide to the Birds of the Delhi Area (1975) by Usha Ganguli, a member of the Delhi Birdwatching Society.][Birdwatching Articles from 1961-70 from Najafgarh lake by Usha Ganguli in \\"Newsletter for Birdwatchers\\" edited by Zafar Futehally] See also * Najafgarh drain bird sanctuary, Delhi * Nearby Najafgarh lake or Najafgarh jheel (Now completely drained by Najafgarh drain) * Najafgarh town, Delhi * National Zoological Park Delhi * Sultanpur National Park, bordering Delhi in adjoining Gurgaon District, Haryana * Okhla Sanctuary, bordering Delhi in adjoining Uttar Pradesh * Bhalswa horseshoe lake, Northwest, Delhi References Further reading * DRAFT MAP ZONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN PLANNING ZONE- 'L'. * SEWAGE PROJECTS to Prevent Untreated Sewage, 29 August 2011, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Press Information Bureau, India * Flood Problem due to Sahibi River, Department of Irrigation and Flood Control, Government of NCT of Delhi, India. * WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT IN NAJAFGARH DRAINAGE BASIN ‚Äì KEY TO WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN RIVER YAMUNA, by Asit Nema of Foundation for Greentech Environmental Systems1 and Dr. Lalit Agrawal of Tokyo Engineering Consultants, Japan2 * FLOOD CONTROL - The National Capital Territory of Delhi * ‚ÄòPart of Najafgarh drain to be covered‚Äô, 12 September 2009, The Hindu * How Sultanpur happened: Sultanpur and Najafgarh Jheels - by Peter Jackson, * ‚ÄòReviving old ponds way out of water woes‚Äô, 9 August 2003, The Indian Express * Action plans on polluted areas in Delhi soon, GN BUREAU, NEW DELHI, MARCH 17, 2010, Governance Now * Proposal for ground water recharge in National Capital Region (NCR) by Dr. S.

Early life John Nicholas Brown was born on December 17, 1861 to John Carter Brown II (1797‚Äì1874) and Sophia Augusta Brown (1825‚Äì1909). His father was a collector of American books in the mid-19th century and was the first American to join the Hakluyt Society as a charter member in 1846, and in 1855, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory His brother was Harold Brown (1863‚Äì1900) and his sister was Sophia Augusta Brown (1867‚Äì1947), who married William Watts Sherman (1842‚Äì1912). In 1881, Brown entered Brown University, however, he left school two years, citing poor health and a weak constitution. He continued his studies of his own accord, traveling extensively and studying history, architecture, languages and the classics. In 1895, the faculty of Brown University voted to confer a degree upon him as a member of the class of 1885. =Family= His paternal grandfather was Nicholas Brown Jr. (1769‚Äì1841), the namesake patron of Brown University (in 1804). His great-grandfather was Nicholas Brown Sr. (1729‚Äì1791), brother of John Brown, Moses Brown, and Joseph Brown, who was a merchant and slave trader who co-founded the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Career After receiving his degree from Brown University, Brown began to work for the family business, Brown & Ives, with the assistance of his cousin William Goddard. He also served as President of the Lonsdale Company, and in 1888, Brown and his brother, Harold, formed a partnership, \\"J.N. & H. Brown.\\" The brother's business was similar to the activities of the family business where they lent funds for mortgages and invested in buildings and lands out west. In their business dealings, John and Harold relied upon George W. R. Matteson, the trustee of their father's estate for advice and assistance. Personal life On September 8, 1897, he married Natalie Bayard Dresser (1869‚Äì1950) at Trinity Church in Newport, Rhode Island. Natalie was the daughter of Brevet Major George Warren Dresser (1837‚Äì1883), a West Point graduate and an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War,New York Times. August 29, 1897. and Susan Fish Le Roy (1834‚Äì1883). Natalie was the great-niece of Hamilton Fish (1808‚Äì1893), a U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. Senator, and New York Governor. Through the Fish family, she was a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the first governor of Dutch colonial New York through Hamilton Fish's mother, Elizabeth Stuyvesant, Peter Stuyvesant's 2x great-granddaughter.Corning (1918), pp. 12-15. Her siblings included D. LeRoy Dresser (1862‚Äì1915), and Edith Stuyvesant Dresser (1873‚Äì1958), the wife of George Washington Vanderbilt II (builder of the Biltmore Estate) and later Sen. Peter Goelet Gerry. Together, they had their only son: * John Nicholas Brown II (1900-1979), the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (AIR) during the Truman administration, who married Anne Seddon Kinsolving (1906-1985), sister of the Rev. Dr. Arthur Lee Kinsolving, rector of Trinity Church in Boston, and later, St. James' Episcopal Church in New York. Rev. Kinsolving was the father of Lee Kinsolving (1938‚Äì1974), the actor. Brown died on May 1, 1900, when his son was only three months old. His brother Harold Brown died a few days later after returning to the United States from Europe after hearing of his brother's death. John Nicholas Brown II was referred to as the richest child in the world at the time. In 1901, his widow donated the funds to build Emmanual Episcopal Church in Newport, RI in his memory. She died at her home, Harbor Court (now the Newport station of the New York Yacht Club), in 1950. =Organizations and philanthropy= Brown was a member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati and the New York Society of Colonial Wars. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1888. On February 1, 1890 Brown became a charter member of the Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was elected as the Society's second president and served May 29, 1890 until May 29, 1891. Ironically, according to the Rhode Island Society's manual published in 1900, Brown \\"never qualified as a member of the Society, nor officiated as president.\\" (pg. 27.) This was because he never completed a formal membership application to join the Society despite having ancestors who supported the cause of American independence. Brown was the donor of the Providence Public Library building in Providence, RI.

It is from the Woodland Period and dates from 1300 to 1550. There is another Potomac Creek site, 44ST1 or Indian Point, which was occupied by the Patawomeck during the historic period and is where Captain John Smith visited.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 2. This site no longer exists, as it eroded away into the river. Site 44ST2 has five ossuaries, one individual burial, and one multiple burial. Other names for the site are Potowemeke and Patawomeke. The defining features include distinctive ceramics, ossuary burials, and palisade villages.Rice, James D. Nature & History in the Potomac Country: from Hunter- gatherers to the Age of Jefferson. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2009. p 32.

These people were anxious to defend their cultural distinctiveness and their territory from neighbors and built a compact, well- fortified village.Blanton, Dennis B., Stevan C. Pullins, Veronica L. Deitrick, and Gwenyth Duncan. The Potomac Creek Site (44ST2) Revisited. Richmond, VA: Virginia Dept. of Historic Resources, 1999. p 92. =Stage One= The site's original occupation is radiocarbon dated to around 1300 AD. From architectural remains it is seen that the village was fortified by a wall and also a ditch or moat indicating protection was a concern for these people. The earliest part of the village appears to be the outmost palisade wall that goes around the entire perimeter. There are multiple bastions on this outside wall. Evidence shows there were multiple palisade walls. These are believed to have occurred in sets to form a more imposing barrier and to create complex entryways. The outside diameter of the village was about 85 meters and had interior of about 5,675 m¬≤. The estimated maximum number that could comfortably reside within the full interior is roughly 250-300 persons.7. William and Mary Center for Archaeological Research. \\"Return to Potomac Creek (44ST2): Archaeology at a Late Prehistoric Native American Village .\\" Virginia Department of Historic Resources. =Stage Two= This stage of the village began in AD 1400 and lasted until ca. 1560. The size of the enclosed area decreased during this time. The size of the enclosed space was 74 meters in diameter, with an overall interior space of 4,300 m¬≤. It seems that the site did not serve as a residence for many people any longer but had a specific purpose. The lack of bastions and ditch reinforcement probably signals a relaxation of defensive concerns. Ossuary 2 is southeast of the structure in the village and could date to this stage. A building in the center of the complex is believed to be the principal structure at this time. Ossuaries 3 and 5 are adjacent to this structure and are also interpreted as part of this period of use. =Stage Three= This stage, dating from AD 1560 to 1650, involves the abandonment of site 44ST2 and the beginning of 44ST1. The use of 44ST2 was no longer for general or specialized habitation but for ossuary burial. Ossuaries 1 and 4 date from this time. The cultural material found at 44ST1 was similar to what was found at 44ST2, just with a greater concentration of European trade items. =Multiple Burial= This burial was found on December 1, 1935 in a corn field on the site of Indian Village at Potomac Creek. The pit was rounded and the remains found were 2 to 2 ¬Ω feet deep with ten skeletons. All of the skeletons were found within a five-foot square but were buried separately, at different times. There were many beads everywhere that were mostly small shell disks and some red, blue, and green glass. This burial contained both adults and children. The large amount of European artifacts indicates that the burial date was either in the last part of the town's occupancy or after its abandonment.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 5-6. =Individual Burial= On May 16, 1937 bones were found in a test pit about 110 feet from the second ossuary. The bones were not fully exposed until September 9. It was thought to be another ossuary but turned out to be one human skeleton, a young adult male. The skeleton was incomplete and some parts had been burned. Part of a dog skeleton was found in the burial. There is no description of these bones, making them seem unimportant.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 10. Judge Graham, the archaeologist working there at the time, thought this grave was not significant and did not do much analysis on the skeletons found inside it. =Ossuary 1= The first ossuary was found on March 21, 1936 and was discovered because of bones that were seen around a groundhog hole. This site was 100 feet northeast of the multiple burial. Archaeologists believe there were 181 skeletons in this ossuary and work continued at this site for over a year, until April 1937. It was oval shaped, 37 ¬Ω feet long, fifteen feet across, and five feet deep. A characteristic specific to this ossuary was its segmentation; the groups of skeletons were separated by layers of dirt. Men, women, and children of a variety of ages were found. The skeletons found were not all laid out flat, there were secondary burials, which are bundles of disarticulated bones. Burnt bones were also found in three different points. One skull was filled with soft yellow sand, which is not common to the area, meaning it was filled by hand or formerly buried. There was a large quantity of European objects, like copper and glass. Other European objects found were a pair of scissors, two hand-wrought iron nails, a piece of scrap iron, and three pieces of glazed tile. Shell beads were the most common native artifact. The beads were mostly associated with the skeletons of children. There were also pipes, shell gorgets, and potsherds.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 6-8. =Ossuary 2= This part of the site was discovered on November 28, 1936. It was roughly oval and had dimensions of 38 feet long, eleven feet wide, and four feet deep. The estimated amount of skeletons was 287. These bones were in better condition than the ones in the first ossuary and were of both sexes and all ages. The bones were closely and continuously intermingled, making them harder to remove. Two distinctive traits of this ossuary are that it did not have any European origin artifacts and only three copper items were found. These copper pieces were proved through testing to be of native origin. This means that it was pure metal, not enhanced by anything like iron, lead, or tin. There was an abundance of shell beads that were native manufactured. Beads were more commonly found with children's skeletons. There were also large beads spread on the floor of the burial. It is thought that these beads might have been scattered there before the burial. Other artifacts found were potsherds, clay pipes (a few whole), quartz arrowheads, scrapers, pieces of hematite, and broken animal, bird, and fish bones.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 8-10. =Ossuary 3= This ossuary was found on May 17, 1937; the day after the individual burial was discovered. It contained 67 skeletons and was about 77 feet from the second ossuary. The bodies found were male and female and consisted of all age groups. The excavation for it was finished by September 17. The shape was egg- shaped and the dimensions were 18 feet long, 11 feet wide, and three and a half feet deep. The bodies were not piled on top of one another but laid side by side. No European artifacts were found in this ossuary, as in Ossuary 2. A difference from Ossuary 2 is that there were few native made artifacts present, beyond low amounts of small shell beads, some bone awls, parts of worked deer antlers, broken animal bones, and broken pottery sherds. =Ossuary 4= The size of this ossuary was 23 feet long, 13 feet wide, and three feet deep. An estimated 41 skeletons were in this ossuary and the bones were poorly preserved. There were no European objects and few that were Indian made. The artifacts found were eight sherds, a small piece of undecorated pipestem, and a baked clay ball. There were no burnt bones noted. None of these bones were kept to do further study on.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 10-11. =Ossuary 5= On July 12, 1939 excavation started on this ossuary and ended July 24 of the same year. The depth from the base of the topsoil was about three feet. In the other ossuaries and burials the bones had been taken out from a side of a vertical cut, in this ossuary the archaeologist (T. Dale Stewart) worked down and exposed the upper surfaces before removing them. This permitted a better observation of the arrangement of skeletons. All the skeletons were laid in no particular direction. An unusual thing about this ossuary is that some of the skeletons had their lower legs bent unnaturally forward at the knee. There were 135 skeletons, 63 adult and 72 children. The archaeologist determined 34 of the adults to be male, 27 to be female, and two he was unsure of. Shell beads were the most common artifact. In one skull a lot of different kinds of beads were found and this is evidence of secondary burial. There was more evidence of secondary burial because of burnt bones. An unusual artifact was a three-foot piece of pine heartwood. This was on top of the bones on the north side. It is thought that the wood was used to carry the bodies to the pit and then put in afterwards. The wood could also be a type of burial structure or something ceremonial. The discovery of mud dauber nests with some of the skeletons supports the interpretation that these were secondary burials. Mud daubers do not build their nests underground showing that the remains were left above ground while they decomposed and were then buried.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 17-20 & 26-28. Artifacts =Ceramics= There are two main types of ceramics associated with this site, Potomac Creek Cord-impressed and Potomac Creek Sand-tempered. A smoothed variety of the Cord-impressed is named Potomac Creek Plain. These three types of ceramic are what the dishes and containers were made of by the people of 44ST2.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 54. Other ceramic artifacts consist of ladles/spoons, beads, worked potsherds, and human effigy figurines. Many of the beads came from several of the ossuaries but also just in general context around the site. Three pottery human effigy figurine heads were found, two with distinct facial features. A similar ceramic head has been found at the Kiser site in Virginia.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 63-64. =Tobacco Pipes= The collection of tobacco pipes included 15 complete clay pipes, 161 fragmentary pipes, two steatite pipes, and a bowl of another. The coloring of the clay pipes is from tan through dark brown to grayish black. Most of the pipes had a polish on them that can still be seen, despite weathering damage. This polish would completely obscure the paste texture of the pipe. The most common decoration on these pipes was one that resembled rouletting and was probably made by a small stamp. There are many sites in the surrounding area that have pipes very similar to the ones found at Potomac Creek. Port Tobacco, Maryland, Moyaone, Pamunkey Reservation, and Keyser Farm Site all have similar to identical pipes as Potomac Creek.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 54-59. =Lithics= Stone artifacts were found in both excavation and surface context. A total of 191 projectile points were found with another 25 that were broken or unclassifiable. The points are assigned to cultural periods from the Early Archaic to the Late Woodland. The majority of the stone tools were made from quartz or quartzite, which would have been obtained locally. Some points were made from rhyolite, chert, of Harper's Ferry quartzite. These types of materials would have been gathered elsewhere and brought back.Stewart, Thomas Dale. Archeological Exploration of Patawomeke the Indian Town Site (44St2), Ancestral to the One (44St1) Visited in 1608 by Captain John Smith. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, 1992. p 64. Theories of Where the People Came From 1) Archaeologists vigorously debate the geographical origins of this culture. Some argue that it was an intrusive culture that came from the north; others for a strong Eastern Shore influence; others that the movement was mostly from the Piedmont to the inner coastal plain; and others that it was a largely in situ development. 2) It is thought that the ancestors of Potomac Creek, and other native complexes similar to it, came from southeastern New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, and northwestern New Jersey.Evans, Clifford. A Ceramic Study of Virginia Archaeology. Washington: U.S. G.P.O., 1955. p 126. What Was Learned 1) The appearance of fortified and planned villages around 1300 and later implies a growth of settlement patterns stimulated by population growth, changing political conditions, and economic strategies.Potter, Stephen R. Commoners, Tribute, and Chiefs: the Development of Algonquian Culture in the Potomac Valley. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1993. p 147. Eight radiocarbon dates on carbonized wood were taken from different features and have established that the site was occupied between AD 1300 and 1550. The latest dates tell that this particular village was not inhabited during the post-contact period, and that the neighboring village site (44ST1) had replaced it by then. 2) The fortified nature of this village indicates that it was a principal place of residence. It is distinguished from ordinary settlements by the fortifications.  See also  *Patawomeck Selected publications * MacCord, Howard (1966) Miniature Human Effigy Heads in Virginia, Part I.

It's widely used in Argentina, where just in the San Luis province, more than 60000 children has been trained with this software in public schools.  How it works  Minibloq is basically a graphical code generator with some IDE capabilities. It's self-contained and every distribution includes the complete [toolchain] needed to compile (or interpret, depending on the selected target) and deploy the code to the selected hardware target. Every code block is configured in XML. Since its first public version, the code is generated in real time (for this purpose uses Scintilla). Here are some examples of code generated for Arduino: Image:MinibloqBlink.pngBlink: Blocks and codes. Image:SimpleCounterSerialOut.pngSimple counter, with serial OUT. Image:ToneWithVariables.pngTones (with a buzzer) varying the frequency. Image:SpritesHeart.jpgSprites for screens like \\"LED-Matrix\\".

Numbers are received from an IR remote control RC5. Since the v0.82 version, it also can be used as an IDE for conventional programming of Arduino and other physical computing boards.  miniSim  Since the v0.82 version, miniBloq includes miniSim: a small 2D robot simulator, aimed specially for kids. It's a very simple tool to help teaching basic robot programming to kids whom do not own a real robot. miniBloq features some simple blocks that controls a small simulated robot with some remembrances to Logo, where the robot can draw a small environment (a maze, for example) and then use a sensor to interact with that environment. miniSim is under the same license as miniBloq, and has been programmed in Python, using PyGame. miniSim is the official simulator software used by the Educ.Ar educational program from the Argentine Government.  Operating systems  Minibloq + OLPC + Arduino. miniBloq runs under Windows and Linux, in principle, without dependencies. The v0.81 version is distributed both as a Windows installer (exe) or as a single multiple OS compressed file, which contains the Windows and the Linux versions. This last distribution was designed to be portable, so the user can run in from a pen drive in any of these operating systems. The version v0.82 comes only in Windows version, since the Linux is under development. However, a preliminary Linux version can be downloaded from a branch from miniBloq's GitHub repository.  Derivative software  There are derivative versions of miniBloq made for specific platforms by third party teams or private companies: * AERobot: an Affordable Education Robot: This is a project from a Team at Harvard University, winner of the African Robotics Network 2103/2014 Design Challenge * ArcBotics miniBloq for Sparki: Specific miniBloq version made from a pre-release of the v0.82 for the ArcBotics' Sparki robot. * Lego Duino: Hobbyist project made by J.

His maternal grandparents were Susan Elizabeth (n√©e Fish) LeRoy (the daughter of Nicholas Fish and Elizabeth Stuyvesant) and Daniel LeRoy. His sisters included Edith Stuyvesant Dresser, who married George Washington Vanderbilt II and Natalie Bayard Dresser Brown, who married John Nicholas Brown I. Two other sisters married Mr. George D. Merrill of Stockbridge, Massachusetts and Viscount Romain D'Osmoy of Paris respectively. He was a graduate of Columbia College in 1889 and a member of the New York Yacht Club and the Seawanhawka- Corinthian Yacht Club. Career He was president of the Trust Company of the Republic which failed in 1903 due to the financial failure of United States Shipbuilding Company. He was also president of the Merchants Association and of the silk commission house of Dresser & Co. In 1908, he was the leader of the Progressive Party in Rhode Island. Near the end of his life he had patented a steam generator but was unable to attract investors to bring it to market. Personal life In November 1889, he married Emma Louise Burnham (1870‚Äì1933) at St. Luke's Church in Matteawan, near Newburgh, New York. She was the daughter of Douglass Williams Burnham and the former Hannah Elizabeth Blodgett.

They are a natural extension of network science since almost all real world networks evolve over time, either by adding or removing nodes or links over time. Often all of these processes occur simultaneously, such as in social networks where people make and lose friends over time, thereby creating and destroying edges, and some people become part of new social networks or leave their networks, changing the nodes in the network. Evolving network concepts build on established network theory and are now being introduced into studying networks in many diverse fields. Network theory background The study of networks traces its foundations to the development of graph theory, which was first analyzed by Leonhard Euler in 1736 when he wrote the famous Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg paper. Probabilistic network theory then developed with the help of eight famous papers studying random graphs written by Paul Erd≈ës and Alfr√©d R√©nyi. The Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model (ER) supposes that a graph is composed of N labeled nodes where each pair of nodes is connected by a preset probability p. Watts‚ÄìStrogatz graph While the ER model's simplicity has helped it find many applications, it does not accurately describe many real world networks. The ER model fails to generate local clustering and triadic closures as often as they are found in real world networks. Therefore, the Watts and Strogatz model was proposed, whereby a network is constructed as a regular ring lattice, and then nodes are rewired according to some probability Œ≤. This produces a locally clustered network and dramatically reduces the average path length, creating networks which represent the small world phenomenon observed in many real world networks. Despite this achievement, both the ER and the Watts and Storgatz models fail to account for the formulation of hubs as observed in many real world networks. The degree distribution in the ER model follows a Poisson distribution, while the Watts and Strogatz model produces graphs that are homogeneous in degree. Many networks are instead scale free, meaning that their degree distribution follows a power law of the form: : P(k)sim k^{-gamma} This exponent turns out to be approximately 3 for many real world networks, however, it is not a universal constant and depends continuously on the network's parameters First evolving network model ‚Äì scale-free networks The Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert (BA) model was the first widely accepted model to produce scale-free networks. This was accomplished by incorporating preferential attachment and growth, where nodes are added to the network over time and are more likely to link to other nodes with high degree distributions. The BA model was first applied to degree distributions on the web, where both of these effects can be clearly seen. New web pages are added over time, and each new page is more likely to link to highly visible hubs like Google which have high degree distributions than to nodes with only a few links. Formally this preferential attachment is: : p_i = frac{k_i}{displaystylesum_j k_j}, Additions to BA model The BA model was the first model to derive the network topology from the way the network was constructed with nodes and links being added over time. However, the model makes only the simplest assumptions necessary for a scale-free network to emerge, namely that there is linear growth and linear preferential attachment. This minimal model does not capture variations in the shape of the degree distribution, variations in the degree exponent, or the size independent clustering coefficient. Therefore, the original model has since been modified to more fully capture the properties of evolving networks by introducing a few new properties. =Fitness= One concern with the BA model is that the degree distributions of each nodes experience strong positive feedback whereby the earliest nodes with high degree distributions continue to dominate the network indefinitely. However, this can be alleviated by introducing a fitness for each node, which modifies the probability of new links being created with that node or even of links to that node being removed. Albert R. and Barab√°si A.-L., \\"Statistical mechanics of complex networks\\", Reviews of Modern Physics 74, 47 (2002) In order to preserve the preferential attachment from the BA model, this fitness is then multiplied by the preferential attachment based on degree distribution to give the true probability that a link is created which connects to node i. : Pi(k_i) = frac{eta_i k_i}{displaystylesum_j eta_j k_j}, Where eta is the fitness, which may also depend on time. A decay of fitness with respect to time may occur and can be formalized by : Pi(k_i) propto k_i(t-t_i)^{- u}, where gamma increases with u. =Removing nodes and rewiring links= Further complications arise because nodes may be removed from the network with some probability. Additionally, existing links may be destroyed and new links between existing nodes may be created. The probability of these actions occurring may depend on time and may also be related to the node's fitness. Probabilities can be assigned to these events by studying the characteristics of the network in question in order to grow a model network with identical properties. This growth would take place with one of the following actions occurring at each time step: Prob p: add an internal link. Prob q: delete a link. Prob r: delete a node. Prob 1-p-q-r: add a node. Other ways of characterizing evolving networks In addition to growing network models as described above, there may be times when other methods are more useful or convenient for characterizing certain properties of evolving networks. =Convergence towards equilibria= In networked systems where competitive decision making takes place, game theory is often used to model system dynamics, and convergence towards equilibria can be considered as a driver of topological evolution. For example, Kasthurirathna and Piraveenan have shown that when individuals in a system display varying levels of rationality, improving the overall system rationality might be an evolutionary reason for the emergence of scale-free networks. They demonstrated this by applying evolutionary pressure on an initially random network which simulates a range of classic games, so that the network converges towards Nash equilibria while being allowed to re-wire. The networks become increasingly scale-free during this process. =Treat evolving networks as successive snapshots of a static network= The most common way to view evolving networks is by considering them as successive static networks. This could be conceptualized as the individual still images which compose a motion picture. Many simple parameters exist to describe a static network (number of nodes, edges, path length, connected components), or to describe specific nodes in the graph such as the number of links or the clustering coefficient. These properties can then individually be studied as a time series using signal processing notions. For example, we can track the number of links established to a server per minute by looking at the successive snapshots of the network and counting these links in each snapshot. Unfortunately, the analogy of snapshots to a motion picture also reveals the main difficulty with this approach: the time steps employed are very rarely suggested by the network and are instead arbitrary. Using extremely small time steps between each snapshot preserves resolution, but may actually obscure wider trends which only become visible over longer timescales. Conversely, using larger timescales loses the temporal order of events within each snapshot. Therefore, it may be difficult to find the appropriate timescale for dividing the evolution of a network into static snapshots. =Define dynamic properties= It may be important to look at properties which cannot be directly observed by treating evolving networks as a sequence of snapshots, such as the duration of contacts between nodes Other similar properties can be defined and then it is possible to instead track these properties through the evolution of a network and visualize them directly. Another issue with using successive snapshots is that only slight changes in network topology can have large effects on the outcome of algorithms designed to find communities. Therefore, it is necessary to use a non classical definition of communities which permits following the evolution of the community through a set of rules such as birth, death, merge, split, growth, and contraction. Applications Route map of the world's scheduled commercial airline traffic, 2009. This network evolves continuously as new routes are scheduled or cancelled. Almost all real world networks are evolving networks since they are constructed over time. By varying the respective probabilities described above, it is possible to use the expanded BA model to construct a network with nearly identical properties as many observed networks. Moreover, the concept of scale free networks shows us that time evolution is a necessary part of understanding the network's properties, and that it is difficult to model an existing network as having been created instantaneously. Real evolving networks which are currently being studied include social networks, communications networks, the internet, the movie actor network, the world wide web, and transportation networks.

This is equivalent to saying that every nonzero submodule of M is an essential submodule. A ring may be called a right (left) uniform ring if it is uniform as a right (left) module over itself. Alfred Goldie used the notion of uniform modules to construct a measure of dimension for modules, now known as the uniform dimension (or Goldie dimension) of a module. Uniform dimension generalizes some, but not all, aspects of the notion of the dimension of a vector space. Finite uniform dimension was a key assumption for several theorems by Goldie, including Goldie's theorem, which characterizes which rings are right orders in a semisimple ring. Modules of finite uniform dimension generalize both Artinian modules and Noetherian modules. In the literature, uniform dimension is also referred to as simply the dimension of a module or the rank of a module. Uniform dimension should not be confused with the related notion, also due to Goldie, of the reduced rank of a module. Properties and examples of uniform modules Being a uniform module is not usually preserved by direct products or quotient modules. The direct sum of two nonzero uniform modules always contains two submodules with intersection zero, namely the two original summand modules. If N1 and N2 are proper submodules of a uniform module M and neither submodule contains the other, then M/(N_1cap N_2) fails to be uniform, as :N_1/(N_1cap N_2)cap N_2/(N_1cap N_2)={0}. Uniserial modules are uniform, and uniform modules are necessarily directly indecomposable. Any commutative domain is a uniform ring, since if a and b are nonzero elements of two ideals, then the product ab is a nonzero element in the intersection of the ideals. Uniform dimension of a module The following theorem makes it possible to define a dimension on modules using uniform submodules. It is a module version of a vector space theorem: Theorem: If Ui and Vj are members of a finite collection of uniform submodules of a module M such that oplus_{i=1}^nU_i and oplus_{i=1}^mV_i are both essential submodules of M, then n = m. The uniform dimension of a module M, denoted u.dim(M), is defined to be n if there exists a finite set of uniform submodules Ui such that oplus_{i=1}^nU_i is an essential submodule of M. The preceding theorem ensures that this n is well defined. If no such finite set of submodules exists, then u.dim(M) is defined to be ‚àû. When speaking of the uniform dimension of a ring, it is necessary to specify whether u.dim(RR) or rather u.dim(RR) is being measured. It is possible to have two different uniform dimensions on the opposite sides of a ring. If N is a submodule of M, then u.dim(N) ‚â§ u.dim(M) with equality exactly when N is an essential submodule of M. In particular, M and its injective hull E(M) always have the same uniform dimension. It is also true that u.dim(M) = n if and only if E(M) is a direct sum of n indecomposable injective modules. It can be shown that u.dim(M) = ‚àû if and only if M contains an infinite direct sum of nonzero submodules. Thus if M is either Noetherian or Artinian, M has finite uniform dimension. If M has finite composition length k, then u.dim(M) ‚â§ k with equality exactly when M is a semisimple module. A standard result is that a right Noetherian domain is a right Ore domain. In fact, we can recover this result from another theorem attributed to Goldie, which states that the following three conditions are equivalent for a domain D: *D is right Ore *u.dim(DD) = 1 *u.dim(DD) < ‚àû Hollow modules and co-uniform dimension The dual notion of a uniform module is that of a hollow module: a module M is said to be hollow if, when N1 and N2 are submodules of M such that N_1+N_2=M, then either N1 = M or N2 = M. Equivalently, one could also say that every proper submodule of M is a superfluous submodule. These modules also admit an analogue of uniform dimension, called co-uniform dimension, corank, hollow dimension or dual Goldie dimension. Studies of hollow modules and co-uniform dimension were conducted in , , , and . The reader is cautioned that Fleury explored distinct ways of dualizing Goldie dimension. Varadarajan, Takeuchi and Reiter's versions of hollow dimension are arguably the more natural ones. Grzeszczuk and Puczylowski in gave a definition of uniform dimension for modular lattices such that the hollow dimension of a module was the uniform dimension of its dual lattice of submodules. It is always the case that a finitely cogenerated module has finite uniform dimension. This raises the question: does a finitely generated module have finite hollow dimension? The answer turns out to be no: it was shown in that if a module M has finite hollow dimension, then M/J(M) is a semisimple, Artinian module. There are many rings with unity for which R/J(R) is not semisimple Artinian, and given such a ring R, R itself is finitely generated but has infinite hollow dimension. Sarath and Varadarajan showed later, that M/J(M) being semisimple Artinian is also sufficient for M to have finite hollow dimension provided J(M) is a superfluous submodule of M.The same result can be found in and This shows that the rings R with finite hollow dimension either as a left or right R-module are precisely the semilocal rings. An additional corollary of Varadarajan's result is that RR has finite hollow dimension exactly when RR does. This contrasts the finite uniform dimension case, since it is known a ring can have finite uniform dimension on one side and infinite uniform dimension on the other.

Elected at the age of 40, he was one of the youngest party leaders in Indonesia. Before this, he was the head of the Democratic Party's national division on Political and Regional Autonomy, and also the head of the Democratic fraction in House of Representatives (DPR) of the Republic of Indonesia. Zhilal was elected to become a member of Indonesia's Parliament during the election of 2009 from the election region of East Java VII, which includes the Blitar City, Blitar Regency, Kediri City, Kediri Regency, and Tulungagung Regency obtaining the highest votes. He has since resigned from this position in the Parliament following his election as party chairman. After being named a graft suspect by Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) for allegedly taking a bribe in relation with the construction of the Hambalang sports complex, he resigned from the post of the Democratic Party chairman on 23 February 2013. In September 2014 he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for corruption. Early life Anas was born in the village of Ngaglik, Srengat, Blitar, East Java and spent his primary, middle and high school years there. His family had links with the Nahdlatul Ulama movement, his father being a schoolteacher and an Islamic cleric.'Anas Urbaningrum Background', The Jakarta Post, 15 June 2011. After graduating from high school, he studied at Arilangga University in Surabaya through the national program for gifted students (Penelusuran Minat dan Kemampuan or PMDK) in 1987. He majored in political science in the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, graduating in 1992. Anas continued his education in the Graduate School at the University of Indonesia in Jakarta and obtained his master's degree in political science in 2000. His thesis has been published as Democratic-Islam: The Thoughts of Nurcholish Madji (Republika, 2000). He is currently finishing his doctoral program in political science in the Graduate School of Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta. Political career Anas entered the political arena through a college student organization. He joined the Islamic Students Association (HMI) and became the chairman of HMI during the congress in Yogyakarta in 1997. As the leader of the largest student organization, Anas became involved in political reform of 1998. During this time he became a member of the Political Law Revision Team, or Team Seven, which was pursuing the demands of the Reformasi movement. During the first democratic election in 1999 Anas became a member of the Political Parties Selection Team, or Team Eleven, and took the responsibility to verify the eligibility of political parties to participate in the national election. He then became a member of the Election Commission (KPU) in 2001-2005 which initiated the election of 2004. After resigning from the KPU, Anas joined the Democratic Party and has been Head of the Political and Regional Autonomy division since 2005. Becoming Member of Parliament Anas was appointed as member of parliament in the election of 2009 from the voting region of East Java VII which includes the cities of Blitar, Blitar District, Kediri, Kediri and Tulungagung District taking in the largest votes at 178.381 votes, surpassing the numeric voting division (BPP) which is 177.374 votes. On October 1, 2009, Anas was appointed as the head of the Democratic Party Fraction in Parliament. His biggest task involved unifying the Democratic Party in their voice during the case of Century Bank. Following his election as party chairman on July 23, 2010, Anas resigned from the DPR. Chosen as Chairman of the Democratic Party As the party who won the election of 2009, the second congress of the Democratic Party in Bandung 20‚Äì23 May 2010 becomes an important milestone in the politics of Indonesia. Anas declared his candidacy in Jakarta on April 15, 2010. In his declaration speech, Anas emphasized that his goal was not to fight or win a race. His candidacy was not to secure a high standing official position. According to Anas, congress is arena for amicable competition amongst brothers. \\"All candidates are the best cadres and brothers that represent the Democratic Party.\\" In this declaration, Anas expressed his agenda to institutionalize the party. That is, how to transform the ideas of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) as the central and most important figure of the Democratic Party into a strong party. His other agenda is internal stabilization; better, more qualified and systematic cadre recruitment; decentralizing the management of party through systematic measures; building political culture of integrity, intelligence and humility; also to manage strong and accountable logistics. Anas's political ideas were further included in his cultural speech \\"Building the Culture of Democracy\\" that took place in Jakarta, May 16, 2010. This speech is part of a continuing culture of debate that can be traced back to Indonesia's founding fathers such as Bung Karno, Bung Hatta, Sjahrir; and other intellectuals such as Tan Malaka, Soedjatmoko, even Kartini who poured out her ideas in letters. In this speech, Anas expressed his ideas on money politics, the patron based system, sub-nasionlalism, and the dominance of \\"ascribed status\\", weak meritocracy and \\"zero-sum game\\" as the greatest challenges in building the culture of democracy that must be protected from the pollution of money politics. Meritocracy will give rise to competent leaders, not a strongman who will bypass the system and institution such that checks and balances can progress effectively. In the middle of his preparation for congress, Anas published his book \\"Silent Revolution\\" in the auditorium of Pikiran Rakyat, Bandung. This book describes the successful strategies of the Democratic Party and SBY in winning the election of 2009. Zhilal illustrated the diligence of the Democratic Party in surveying the market periodically and to include all elements of the party. The book also includes personal observations of how a party works hard in preparation of the election without much public fanfare. There was tight competition in congress between three candidates: Anas, Andi Malaranggeng (who is also Minister of Youth and Sports), and Marzuki Alie (DPR RI Chairman) who only declared his candidacy one day before congress started. In the first round of votings, Anas lead (236 votes) over Marzuki Alie (209 votes) and Andi Malarangeng (82 votes). As none of the candidates received more than 50% of the votes, there was a second round of votings. In the process of this second round, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono declared a statement saying that all regional and municipal representatives should vote for the general chairman of the Democratic Party by following their heart, illustrating the workings of democracy within the party. In the second round, Anas took lead by receiving 280 votes. Marzuki Alie received 240 votes, while two votes were absentees. This election made Anas one of the youngest Chairman of a political party in Indonesia. In response to the win, Anas said, \\"You see for yourself, I won through a democratic election. This is evidence, that in addition to being a party that prioritizes democracy, Mr. SBY is also a true democrat as he never got involved in the process of election, including supporting one of the candidates.\\" On October 17, 2010, Anas appointed the Democratic Party's plenary board that is composed of 2.000 people, at the same time the birthday of the party was being celebrated in Jakarta. Resignation The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) named Democratic Party chief Anas Urbaningrum a graft suspect for allegedly taking bribes and receiving goods in relation with the construction of the Hambalang sports complex on Friday, February 22, 2013. The KPK earlier named two other suspects in the Hambalang case ‚Äì former youth and sports minister Andi Mallarangeng and Dedi Kusdinar, also of the same ministry. The following day after the KPK named him suspect, he announced his resignation from the post of the Democratic Party chief. Anas pleaded innocent in his trial but refused to reveal where his wealth was obtained.

Hoover Press, 1978. p. 128. was a state allied with Soviet Russia that existed in Crimea for several months in 1919 during the Russian Civil War. It was the second Bolshevik government in Crimea and its capital was Simferopol. Description In April 1919, the Bolsheviks invaded Crimea for the second time (the first was in March 1918 and led to the creation of the short-lived Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic). After the conquest of Crimea (with the exception of the Kerch Peninsula) by the 3rd Ukrainian Red Army, a Crimean Regional Party Conference at Simferopol from 28‚Äì29 April adopted a resolution forming the Crimean Soviet Socialist Republic and a revolutionary committee government. By 30 April, the Bolsheviks had occupied the entire peninsula and, on 5 May, the government was formed with Dmitry Ilyich Ulyanov, Vladimir Lenin's brother, as chairman. On 1 June, the Crimean SSR joined in military union with soviet republics in Russia, Ukraine, Belorussia, Lithuania, and Latvia. The republic was declared to be a non-national entity based on the equality of all nationalities. Nationalization of industry and confiscation of the land of landlords, kulaks, and the church were implemented. The Crimean SSR was more friendly toward the interests of Crimean Tatars than the Taurida SSR had been and leftist Tatars were allowed to take positions in the government. Starting in late May, Anton Denikin's White Volunteer Army, which had been gaining strength, threatened seizure of Crimea. On 18 June, White forces under Yakov Slashchov (–Ø–∫–æ–≤ –°–ª–∞—â—ë–≤) landed in the area Koktebel and, as a result, the authorities of the Crimean SSR were evacuated from Crimea from 23‚Äì26 June and the Whites assumed control of the peninsula.

The book centers particularly on his participation in the 1944 mass escape from the German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag Luft III. An English-language translation was published in 2019. Summary M√ºller served in the No. 331 Squadron RAF, when he was shot down over the sea during a flight mission on 19 June 1942.M√ºller 1946, pp. 5-15 He was captured and brought a prisoner-of-war camp, Durchgangslager Frankfurt,M√ºller 1946, pp. 31-60 and after interrogations eventually transferred to the camp Stammlager Luft III.M√ºller 1946, pp. 60-68 As a prisoner in the camp, M√ºller participated in the escape plans, by helping with the ventilation of the tunnels dug by the prisoners.Muller 1946 pp. 69-82 Location of the opening of the tunnel Harry. In 1943 the prisoners were moved to a new camp site, and shortly thereafter they secretly organized the digging of three new tunnels, called Tom, Dick and Harry.Muller 1946 pp. 84-82 On 24 March 1944 a number of prisoners made their way out of the camp through the tunnel Harry. Along with fellow prisoner Per Bergsland from RAF 332 Squadron, M√ºller eventually managed to escape to Sweden, after travelling by train to Frankfurt, taking a connecting train to K√ºstrin, then another train to Stettin. During the travel they were camouflaged as Norwegian electricians working in Germany, equipped with false documents made by other prisoners, including travel orders to change their workplace from Frankfurt to Stettin. They finally reached Sweden by hiding on a ship.Muller 1946 pp. 105-144 After about ten days in Stockholm they were transported to Scotland in two Mosquito aeroplanes (each Mosquito could only carry one passenger), and arrived in London on 8 April 1944.Muller 1946 p. 144 Only three of the seventy-six runaways from Stalag Luft III managed to escape to freedom, while the other 73 were caught after a giant man-hunt, and fifty men were executed by shooting as reprisal. M√ºller and Bergsland had no contact with the other escapees after they left the tunnel opening, and did not know the fate of the escapees until they were on their way to Canada to work as flight instructors. The 1946 book lists the number of escapees as 82, the number of caught as 79, and the number of shot as 54, numbers that have been corrected after later investigations.

Biography Born in Melbourne, Australia to Salvation Army parents, the second of four children, Darlow moved to Hong Kong at five years of age. He spent the next six years there attending Beacon Hill Primary School before returning to Melbourne to begin high school. Two years at Essendon Grammar were then followed by another move to Perth, Western Australia, where he attended Hollywood High School. After this, he moved back to Melbourne where he completed school at Strathmore High School. Following on from high school, Darlow began a teaching degree at RMIT. During this time, he also worked in bars and pubs, including a two-year stint at Melbourne Hilton on the Park. Upon completion of his university studies, Darlow worked at three high schools and one primary school, teaching music. After two and a half years of full-time teaching, Darlow resigned to focus on writing music, recording and touring. http://www.undercover.fm/news/17652-scott-darlow- announces-new-album =Music career= Darlow started playing the cornet at five years of age. With both of his parents being Salvation Army Officers, his first musical experiences were of watching the brass band at Hawthorn Salvation Army. He is said to have fallen in love with music from that moment on, determined to play in the band just like the men he watched each Sunday. He was given a cornet at five years of age, and started playing in a brass band at age seven. From there, he learned to play Beach Boys and Beatles songs. Darlow continued to play the trumpet throughout high school, along with classical guitar. It was also at this time that he started playing trumpet and saxophone in bands around Melbourne. Darlow is said to be proficient on the trumpet, trombone, saxophone, clarinet, didgeridoo, piano and guitar, as well as being a singer. At nineteen years of age, he decided to start taking his guitar playing more seriously and began writing songs. After being introduced to and mentored by Melbourne gospel artist Paul Colman, Darlow began recording his first album, entitled Be with You, with indie producer David Carr. It was released under the name of his band at the time, The Darlow Show, in January 2003. This album included crowd favourite track \\"Sorry\\", a song about his Aboriginal heritage which included a vocal part from AFL footballer David Wirrpanda. This was followed in 2005 by a live acoustic album called Underground, also released under The Darlow Show moniker. In 2008, Darlow released a third album called The Whole Earth Sings, this time under his own name. Total combined sales of physical copies of these albums exceeded 23,000. In January 2016, Darlow released the first single from his fifth album, \\"Solid Rock\\", a cover of the Goanna hit from 1982. Darlow enlisted the help of the song's author and original singer, Shane Howard, on vocals and recorded it as a duet. \\"Solid Rock\\" was added to radio stations all over Australia and New Zealand and was the most-played rock song on Australian radio in February 2016. Similarly, the music video for the single went viral after radio station Triple M shared the video via Facebook, with over 200,000 people viewing it. Darlow released their second single from the album, \\"Down Like Flies\\", in late May 2016. This second single got solid radio play around Australia, with the supporting music video featuring well known Australian actor Matt Hetherington, TV personality Melissa Hetherington, TV and radio personality and author, Jane Gazzo as well as Darlow's son Emmanuel. January 2018 saw radio success for Darlow, in the form of his most recent release, a remake of an older production \\"Sorry\\", an apologetic song that protests white settlement in Australia and the mistreatment of Aboriginal people in the following centuries. In 2018, Darlow enlisted the help of fellow Australian musicians Sarah McLeod, Adam Brand, Jack Jones and Todd Hunter to re-record the Dragon song \\"Rain\\" with all net proceeds from the sale to go towards the Buy-a-bale program in support of Australian farmers suffering from the Australian drought. He also visited many schools including SMIC.

Originally adopted in 1858, it has undergone several alterations since then, in 1971 and 1983. Symbolism A sun on the western horizon is a sunset. The straight horizon line reflects the plains covering much of Minnesota. The native on horseback is riding towards the southwest leaving Minnesota as the pioneer is coming from the east taming the land with his plow. The Indian's horse and spear and the Pioneer's ax, rifle, and plow represent tools of daily life. The native is riding away from the Pioneer symbolizing the displacement that was taking place in Minnesota. The only interaction between the figures is one observing the other ride away. The stump symbolizes the subjugation of the land and the importance of the lumber industry to Minnesota in 1858. The Mississippi River and St. Anthony Falls are depicted in the revised seal to note the importance of these resources in transportation, industry and the settling of the state. The cultivated ground also indicates the subjugation of the land while the plow symbolizes the importance of agriculture in Minnesota and its future. Beyond the falls three pine trees represent the state tree and the three pine regions of the state; the St Croix, Mississippi, and Lake Superior. In the original version, the Indian is horseback, in native attire, riding away from the settler. While the settler is in the field with his firearm tilling over virgin prairie land. There was tension between some tribes of the Sioux and the settlers. \\"The Indian's Revenge\\" by Alexander Berghold, writes about an outbreak of Indian attacks which started much as the scene in the original seal. His book states in 1891, that after the attacks, settlers were allowed to kill any Sioux that was found in a settlement and that no settler left their home without their rifle. He goes on to say, \\"The seal of the State, therefore, seems very appropriate\\".

The scandal centered on the way that Trinity Baptist Church, an Independent Baptist church in Concord, New Hampshire, and its former pastor handled the 1997 rape and subsequent pregnancy of one of its members, a minor girl, by her employer. The employer was another member of the congregation who hired the girl as a babysitter for his children. Tina Anderson rape incident In 1997, Tina Anderson, a member of Trinity Baptist Church, was raped by church member and father Ernest Willis, whose children she babysat; she was 15 years old at the time.. She became pregnant, and Anderson later testified that she had confided her pregnancy to Willis, and that Willis offered to pay for an abortion but when rejected by Anderson, Willis suggested punching Anderson in the stomach to induce a miscarriage, which she also rejected. Chuck Phelps was the senior pastor at the time. According to a 20/20 documentary about the incident, Phelps allegedly forced Anderson to \\"confess her sin\\" before the congregation, covered up the crime by sending her to another Independent Baptist family in Colorado during her pregnancy, and had her give up her child for adoption. The people around Anderson told her not to talk about it, and the case remained unaddressed until Anderson received a call from the Concord police in February 2010. Matt Barnhart, a former Trinity Baptist Church member who had witnessed Anderson's \\"church discipline\\" session in 1997, had reported the session on a blog (Independent Fundamentalist Baptist (IFB) cult survivors). The blog founder Jocelyn Zichterman followed up with Barnhart and upon learning Anderson's identity and location she contacted the Concord police. Willis was arrested in 2010. In June 2010 Brian Fuller, the pastor who followed Phelps, expressed deep regret about the way the church had handled the incident and disgust that Willis was allowed to remain a church member for seven years following the incident. On April 8, 2011, the incident was featured on ABC's 20/20, as part of a show about religious abuse including other cases of rape like Anderson's, in Independent Fundamentalist Baptist churches. In response to the 20/20 episode, Phelps posted a statement to his website in which he said that Anderson was 16 at the time of her pregnancy, said the accused rapist was never a church officer, and said that Anderson was never forced to make a statement before the church. On April 8, 2011, the church released a statement saying that in 1997, it had \\"immediately notified\\" the New Hampshire Division of Children, Youth and Families about the incident but regretted how \\"the incident was handled,\\" confirming that the \\"victim stood before the congregation,\\" and which said that \\"the accused remained in our congregation awaiting arrest by the Concord Police Department.\\"Statement by Trinity Baptist Church, April 8, 2011. Before trial, Willis pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape but denied he forcibly raped Tina Anderson twice in 1997. She said it happened once while he was giving her driving lessons and again at her home weeks later. Willis testified that the two had sex on only one occasion and it was consensual. The trial started in May 2011. On May 27, 2011, a jury found Willis guilty of three counts of forcible rape and a count of felonious sexual assault; and on September 7, 2011, a judge sentenced him to 15 to 30 years in prison.Suzan Clarke and Alice Gomstym for ABC News via 20/20. Sept. 6, 2011 Former Baptist Church Member Ernest Willis Sentenced to Prison for Rape of Teen Parishioner In a victim impact statement at sentencing, Anderson said that Willis destroyed the person she was and filled her with shame and guilt. Willis appealed his conviction to the New Hampshire Supreme Court; the court denied his appeal. Despite the media outcry, Phelps remained on Bob Jones University's Board of Trustees until an online campaign finally led to his resignation in December 2011.Greenville News, December 3, 2011.  Remedial measures taken by the church  In June 2010, the congregation approved three amendments to the church constitution. The first created a Security Team to provide security during public gatherings and to authorize criminal background checks for all volunteers in the children‚Äôs ministry. The second amendment forbade a member from being ‚Äúrequired to involuntarily participate in a public confession that is not the result of the church discipline process outlined in Article V of the Constitution.‚Äù The third amendment restricted membership‚Äîand thus the subjects of church discipline‚Äîto persons eighteen years or older.
