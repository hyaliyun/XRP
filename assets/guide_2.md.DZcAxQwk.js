The Liber consists of four books in Latin, the first two of which were written by Bernard of Angers during and following his three pilgrimages to the shrine of Saint Faith in the 1010s and 1020s. The last two were written by three different anonymous authors.Fanning (1997), 214–16. Manuscript and publication history All surviving manuscripts contain the Liber miraculorum sancte Fidis or, generally, parts of it, derive ultimately from a manuscript compiled at Conques in the third quarter of the eleventh century. Only part of this manuscript survives. The most complete surviving version of the Liber is found in a late eleventh-century manuscript from the church of Saint Faith in Sélestat. Several other twelfth- and thirteenth-century copies of at least part of the original Conques manuscript are found in archives in the Vatican, London, Namur and Munich. A twelfth-century version from the cathedral of Rodez (near Conques) and a fourteenth-century one from Chartres are embellished with legends that were not in the original version. Modern editions of the text do not therefore correspond to any existing medieval manuscript, but instead must collate multiple different versions. Earlier printed versions were based on single manuscripts: Philippe Labbe's of 1657 on a now lost manuscript from Besançon and Jean Mabillon's of 1707 on the Chartres manuscript. The Bollandists in the 1770s published Mabillon's edition, while the Patrologia Latina (1841–55) contained that of Labbe. The more complete manuscript of Sélestat was used for the Monumenta Germaniae Historica and for Auguste Bouillet's 1897 edition. In 1994 Luca Robertini published the first edition based on all the known manuscripts and informed by all previous editions. Pamela Sheingorn produced an English translation the following year. It is identical to Robertini's Latin edition for the first three books, but they diverge in the fourth owing to different decisions about what to include or exclude from the scattered surviving manuscripts. Purpose and content The gold reliquary statue of Saint Faith The purpose of the Liber was twofold. In the words of Jean Hubert and Marie-Clotilde Hubert: > It presents itself as a work of edification, but also of propaganda, > intended to spread the renown of the sanctuary where wondrous cures and > other miracles were effected. The descriptions of a multitude of pilgrims > pressed into the narrow space where the statue was displayed were very > likely intended to attract new dévotées.Sheingorn (1995), 22–. As a work of edification, it would have circulated among priests and other clergy and used as a source for vernacular sermons, especially at sites where devotion to Faith was an established part of local church life. The first miracle recorded in the book took place in 983. A man who had had his eyes gouged out had them restored to him by Saint Faith, after which he was known as Guibert the Illuminated. This was the miracle with which Faith's posthumous career began, and it caused the Abbey of Conques to flourish. While most contemporary works of hagiography arrange their material chronologically, Bernard instead divides the miracles into categories and arranges them chronologically only within a given type. Thus, the miracle of 983 is followed by a series of miracles involving eyes. This organizing principle was maintained by the continuators who added books three and four.

It is made of ceramic and portrays three different figural scenes: one with athletes, one with ritual dancers (Komasts), and one with a drinking activity, on each of its legs. Its creation is attributed to the group of vessels known as the Boetian Dancers Group and is currently held at the Dallas Museum of Art.  Purpose  This particular vessel is a combination of both the kothon and tripod pottery shapes. A tripod refers to a three-legged stand used to support some sort of bowl or container, preventing it from falling over. In the case of this pot, the tripod is used to support a kothon (a type Greek pot generally used for domestic purposes). This kothon held some kind of perfume, as indicated by its small size. As a vessel for perfume storage, the kothon was situated on top of a tripod because it made the substance inside more difficult to spill, protecting the valuable luxury good inside of it. = Perfume and Greek Athletics = In antiquity, perfume functioned both as a sign of elitism and as a means of maintaining good hygiene. While it was used by both genders, males most publicly applied perfume, often in relation to athletic activities. Post exercise, they would coat themselves in perfume to mask the smell of their sweat at public bathing houses in an effort to be more hygienic. The idea of perfume being correlated to good hygiene was propagated by Hippocrates, an ancient Greek physician known by many as the founder of medical science, who claimed that perfume could be used to prevent disease.  Figural Decoration  This kothon black- figure tripod is decorated with several figural designs, as was typical of pottery during the Archaic Period. The primary figural designs are found on the tripod's legs and illustrate males in the nude participating in various Greek activities. These figural decorations are indicative of Greek lives of luxury, as it was the wealthy who participated in elaborate drinking parties (symposiums) and watched athletic duels like those depicted on the vase. = Athletes = This black-figure amphora, painted by the potter Nikosthenes, displays a Grecian boxing scene similar to the one depicted on the Boetian Dancers Group's Kothon, Black Figure Tripod. Decorating the third leg of the tripod are two men facing each other with their arms raised in a fighting position, suggesting they are engaged in the athletic sport of boxing. The artist who painted this vessel uses facial hair to show a difference in age between the two athletes. The athlete on the left side has a beard and longer hair, suggesting he is older, while the athlete on the right has no facial hair whatsoever and is slightly thinner, suggesting he is younger. Behind them sits a tripod, likely the prize for the winner of their duel. This tripod can be interpreted as a reference to the type of pottery in which it is painted on, however because it is not as wide and bulky it is most likely supposed to be made of bronze and thus not exactly the same as the Boetian Dancer Group Kothon, Black Figure Tripod. The depiction of two athletes interacting in a combative sport that focuses on individual performance is representative of Greek culture during the Archaic period, which emphasized one's personal bravery and courage in taking on an opponent.  Boxing in Ancient Greece  Boxing was one of the most popular and dangerous combat sports in ancient Greece. Opponents were chosen at random without consideration for differences in weight and/or age. Similar to modern-day boxing gloves, boxers would wrap their hands in himantes (leather thongs) around their hands and wrists for protection during boxing matches. = Komasts = Different from the Kothon, Black Figure Tripod discussed in this article, this Komast Cup from the Louvre is an example of how Komasts were depicted on ancient Greek pottery. The second leg of the tripod features two male dancers, or Komasts (drunken, ritualistic dancers who were frequently depicted on Greek pottery), engaged in an intimate dance with each other. Komasts were commonly featured at symposiums, or formalized drinking parties, as entertainment is closely related to revelry in Ancient Greek culture and celebration of athletic achievement. The black-figure artist who painted this particular pot has added a line going across each dancer's arm, perhaps indicative of a sleeve/garmet common of komast dancers of the time. One of the dancers' arms is intimately extended towards his counterpart's chin in a gesture with some sexual implications. This depiction of homosexuality among komasts is not uncommon in Greek pottery. = Drinking Scene = On the first leg of the tripod two nude men are illustrated drinking wine. While one man hold the wine pitcher directly to his lips, greedily drinking all that is left inside, the other extends his cup, hoping that his friend will share. However, the frown he wears suggests that he believes that there will be no wine left for him to drink. This drinking scene is representative of a symposium, a formalized drinking party commonly depicted in Ancient Greek art and indicative of elitism in Ancient Grecian society. This figural representation of the aristocratic drinking party further highlights the vessel's intended use as a sign of status.  Boeotian Dancers Group  The region of Boetia, also referred to as Boiotia, where this Kiothon, Black Figure Tripod and other vessels in the Boetian Dancers Group originate. This Kothon, Black Figure Tripod is thought to be a part of the Boeotian Dancer's Group due to its shape, size, and figural decoration is similar to those in the group. These vessels were often tripod cauldrons featuring figural designs of Komasts. Often Komasts are the only figural decoration featured on pottery by the Boeotian Dancer's Group, however when other figural decoration is present it is often depicting situations of high activity. Because there are several different painters within the Boeotian Dancer's Group, across pots the Komasts are in similar poses and styles, but not identical.

It is the 21st overall episode of the series and is written by Erik Mountain from a story by Mountain and series creator Jonathan Nolan and directed by Frederick E. O. Toye. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on May 3, 2012. Plot =Flashbacks= In February 2011, Reese (Jim Caviezel) is on a bus to New Rochelle, after seemingly \\"losing his job.\\" He then arrives at a hospital, asking for Jessica, who used to work there as a nurse. He is told by a nurse that Jessica died in a car crash two months ago. In another flashback, it's revealed that Jessica (Susan Misner) was accidentally killed when she was arguing with Peter (Jonno Roberts). Instead of calling the police, he staged her death to make it look like a car accident. Reese breaks in Jessica's house while Peter is gone. When Peter arrives, Reese laments the situation he placed on Jessica for leaving her and proceeds to attack Peter. =Present day= Reese arrives early at the library but is told by Finch (Michael Emerson) that the Machine hasn't produced any number. Finch then gives him a present as it's his birthday and gives him the day off. When he leaves, Finch begins investigating their new number: Karen Garner (Dagmara Dominczyk). Reese opens the present, revealing it to be a key. Carter is told by Agent Donnelly (Brennan Brown) that Reese's new details have linked him to a case in New Rochelle in 2011. She then meets with Finch in a bar, who tells her to meet with Donnelly and work with him to get information. Karen is revealed to be working there as a waitress. Finch runs into a U.S. Marshal named Brad Jennings (Jeremy Davidson), who claims that Karen is a fugitive named Sarah Atkins. Before he continues getting questioned, Reese takes Finch. Reese confronts Finch for the case. He explains that when he began working on the Machine, the same numbers would show up frequently, eventually finding that the women would be abused by their husbands. Reese meets with Karen, whose real name is Sarah Jennings, the abused wife of the Marshal. Reese attacks the Marshal in his office and threatens him to never contact Sarah again. Meanwhile, Carter is told by Donnelly that resurfacing evidence suggests that Peter was in debt with loan sharks and Reese was sent to kill Peter. She examines Jessica's body and instantly deduces that Peter was abusing her. Sarah attempts to leave New York but is arrested by authorities and the Marshal picks her up. Reese locates the hotel they are staying at and drives alone there. He attacks the Marshal and is about to kill him when Carter arrives and lets him do the rest of the work. Carter is called by a warden in Torreón that they received \\"her fugitive\\", delivered by the \\"Marshal\\". Deducing Reese took the Marshal to justice, Carter gets happy. Reese is given an address by Finch and using the key he received, finds that is a new loft for him to reside. In a final flashback, it's revealed that Finch (in a wheelchair) was present when Reese received Jessica's death, revealing to be a person of interest he failed to save. He utters, \\"I'm so sorry\\" to Reese's retreating back. Reception =Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Many Happy Returns\\" was seen by an estimated 13.27 million household viewers and gained a 2.5/7 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 4% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 12.73 million viewers with a 2.4/6 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the third most watched show on CBS for the night beating The Mentalist, but behind Rules of Engagement, and The Big Bang Theory, second on its timeslot and fifth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Rules of Engagement, Grey's Anatomy, American Idol, and The Big Bang Theory. =Critical reviews= \\"Many Happy Returns\\" received very positive reviews from critics. Keysha Couzens of TV Overmind wrote \\"The final shot of Reese exploring his birthday present gave us Reese being as close to finding peace with himself than we’ve yet seen on Person of Interest. Now if we could only fill in the blanks on Harold Finch’s past, then I’d be supremely pleased with the first season of the show as a whole–I’m simply dying to know more about him all the time. I blame Michael Emerson’s infuriatingly charismatic enigmatic character portrayal in addition to the writing for giving us just enough to make us crave more especially when the focus is on someone else.\\" Luke Gelineau of TV Equals wrote \\"It was a bit strange that we didn't hear anything about Reese's old partner this episode, seeing as how the reveal that she's still alive was a bit of a cliffhanger last week. We did get a cool little bit of information in that Finch has been researching Reese for a long time, and it will be interesting to see if he ever tells Reese about that. With only two episode left after tonight, it will be interesting to see how everything is wrapped up! I can't wait!\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.8 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"There's something truly entertaining about watching a show that feels like it has the potential to be predictable, yet manages to flip concepts on their head or find a nice balance between character and story rather than lay out a simple cookie cutter hour of television. Even the raw emotions and ideals that delve into morality and change while ignoring simple happy endings make Person of Interest continue to stand out.\\"  References  External links * \\"Many Happy Returns\\" at CBS \\"Many Happy Returns\\" at TV Guide * Person of Interest (TV series) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Many Happy Returns (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"55962027","text":"There are two tumuli at Marathon, Greece. One is a burial mound (Greek τύμβος, tymbos, tomb), or \\"Soros\\" that houses the ashes of 192 Athenians who fell during the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The other houses the inhumed bodies of the Plataeans who fell during that same battle. The burial mound dominates the plain of Marathon, where the eponymous battle took place, along with the tumulus of the Plataeans, and a victory column erected by the Athenians to commemorate their victory over Darius' Persian expedition. The tumulus is encompassed in a park today. Battle of Marathon The Battle of Marathon took place on September 12, or possibly August 12, 490 BCE at the plain of Marathon. Athens and its ally Plataea, some 11,000 hoplites in total, attacked a Persian expeditionary force of some 25,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, with 100,000 armed sailors acting as reserves. The Athenian forces attacked down a hillside onto the coastal plain, and using the momentum of their tightly packed, heavily armored formation routed the less disciplined Persian flanks, which were unused to fighting heavily armored troops. The subsequent rout left the Persian center exposed and as a result the Persians suffered high casualties as their command structure fell into disarray and as soldiers scrambled onto their ships. Herodotus claims that the Greeks counted 6,400 dead Persians on the field, but could make no account for those who fled into the swamps off to the north of the battlefield. Herodotus states that the Athenians lost 192 men in the battle and the Plataeans lost 11. The Monuments The Tumulus of the Athenians. There are three monuments of the plain of Marathon, the Athenian Tumulus, the Plataean Tumulus, and a victory column erected by the Athenians. Both tumuli are fairly standard with hemispherical shapes and with the dead interred within the hole left by the excavation of the dirt that would be piled on top of them. The tumuli are unusual, however, because such monumental burial practices had been out of style in central Greece since the seventh century. The Athenians normally buried their war dead in the Kerameikos cemetery, with a stele or marker vase to show the location of the deceased. However, some scholars have suggested that the raising of the tumuli was a deliberate attempt to evoke Homer by the Athenians and their allies. This concept is based on the similarities between the structure and interment method used with the tumuli, and the description of the burial practices used by and for their mythical heroes in the Iliad. The Tumulus of the Plataeans. The Athenian Tumulus stands around tall and was excavated in 1884 by D. Philios and then again in 1890 and 1891 by V. Stias. The Plataean Tumulus is smaller at around , and was identified and excavated in 1970 by Prof. Marinatos, who was the Greek Inspector General of Antiquities at that time. A large layer of ash and charred bone was found in the Athenian Tumulus while multiple bodies were found inhumed in the Plataean Tumulus.

It was founded in 1953 after the dissolution of the Saint Catherine of Siena fife and drum corps in Norwood, MA. The corps has marched in parades around the world playing from a repertoire of traditional Irish songs and historical American tunes, often from the Revolutionary and Civil War eras. The current head of the Board of Directors is Jim Grover. The Colonial Boys were charter members of The Company of Fifers and Drummers and hosted the first National Muster of The Company of Fifers and Drummers in May, 1972. Uniform & Equipment Their uniform consists of black jacket with gold lining, black tricorne hat with gold lining, white pants, jabot, and black gaiters with gold buttons. The design of the current uniform is made to keep in line with the look of the original uniforms from 1953. Far from being an attempt to accurately depict 18th century clothing, the first uniforms of the Colonial Boys were made up of old WWII U.S. Navy uniforms. The sleeves of jackets were cut off and had buttons sewn on to be made as gaiters, and a yellow lining was added to everything. This was done because once the Saint Catherine's Fife and Drum Corps was disbanded, the members had no uniforms to use when they decided to continue marching as an independent group. The mothers of the boys and other women in Norwood's Irish community made the outfits with what they had readily available, and thus the iconic uniform was born.Conversations with Norwood women who took part The drum major, who stands behind the Color Guard and in front of the Fife section, wears a three-piece green uniform including a jacket with tales. The Norwood Colonial Boys play on wooden fifes, with many being simple one-piece fifes. The drummers are majority snare drummers, with several bass drummers who march in the rear. All of the drums are rope drums. The drum major is equipped with a mace. The Color Guard, who lead the unit when in parade formation, always carry the American and Irish flags in each and every parade. Beyond that, the Gadsden flag is often carried, along with the Erin go Bragh flag, Bunker Hill flag, a shamrock flag, the Norwood Colonial Boys flag, Town of Norwood flag, and the Hawaiian state flag. In addition, an honor guardsman armed with a 6-foot long pike often marches to the right of the American flag. History The origins of the Corps lies within the tight-knit Irish immigrant community which settled in Norwood almost exclusively from the Irish-speaking region of Connemara in Galway, Ireland and the local Saint Catherine of Siena Parish. In the early 1900s, the children of these Irish immigrants formed together to create the Saint Catherine's Fife & Drum Corps, taught by their local priest. The older boys of the parish, once they outgrew the SCS Corps, banded together and formed the Norwood Fife & Drum Corps which marched through the 1930s and 1940s. Conversations with older members of the Colonial Boys and relatives of current members These sibling corps combined the fife & drum tradition of New England with the songs of their homeland, and in fact the majority of the Irish tunes played by corps in the Northeast can be traced back to the exchange of music with the Colonial Boys at musters in the 1960s and 1970s. In exchange, these thoroughly American groups taught the Norwood corps many colonial era songs. Conversations with older Colonial Boys members and members of other corps Junior Corps Over the years, the Colonial Boys have taught several junior corps. Many of the members of these corps later on were promoted to the senior corps and have become the backbone of the corps today. In the 1950s , there was a junior corps called the Liberty Boys which lasted a few years. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a large junior corps was formed called the Tiots, after the name of the Norwood High School yearbook and Native American name for the town of Norwood. The Tiots marched with the senior corps until a split arose and many Tiots left to form an independent corps known as the Union Brigade. The Tiots who remained with the Colonial Boys began to march as senior members, and most remain so into the present day. Some Union Brigade members also came back in later years and have marched at times with the Colonial Boys.Conversations with older Colonial Boys members In 2008, another junior version called the Junior Colonial Boys was started. Several of the members are related to members of the older corp.. This group marched directly behind the senior corps for three parade seasons until its members were all called up to the corps where they continue to march today.Source: former Junior Corps member List of Notable Parades * 1960’s Multiple St. Patrick’s Day Parades NYC * 1970 St. Patrick’s Day Parade Dublin, Ireland * 1970 Cherry Blossom Parade Washington, DC * 1971 St. Patrick’s Day Parade Dublin, Ireland * 1988 St. Patrick's Day Parade, Dublin, Ireland * 1994 St. Patrick's Day Parade, Waikiki, Hawaii * 1997 Fourth of July Parade, Hawaii * 2000-2003 St. Patrick's Day Parade, Savannah, Georgia * 2005-2006 St. Patrick's Day Parade, San Antonio, Texas * 2011 St. Patrick's Day Parade, Naples, Florida References External links * American instrumental musical groups Fife players Massachusetts culture Irish-American culture ","title":"Norwood Colonial Boys Fife &amp; Drum Corps"},{"id":"55962083","text":"Janet F.

However, while taking anthropology courses at Saint Mary's University, Kitz grew interested in the disaster and its effects on the people of Halifax.Lorna Inness and Tracy Leal, \\"Putting a Face on a disaster\\", Halifax Chronicle Herald, December 2, 2007, p.11 The 1917 munitions explosion killed nearly 2,000 people but was little known outside of Halifax. Only two books had been written about the event in the 70 years after the explosion and the only commemoration was a library in the North End of Halifax.Shania Luck, \\"Halifax Explosion Gaining Momentum\\", Halifax Chronicle Herald, December 6, 2006 After writing a paper about the explosion, Kitz was hired by the Nova Scotia Museum to assist the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in cataloguing thousands of objects in the mortuary collection of objects from victims of the explosion discovered in the basement of the provincial legislature. This led to a temporary exhibit at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic called \\"A Moment in Time\\" in 1987 which was expanded to become a permanent exhibit curated by Kitz called \\"Halifax Wrecked\\" in 1994. Kitz also began to interview survivors of the explosion and their families, a process which evovled to become an ongoing oral history project with explosion survivors and their families.Inness and Leal, p. 12 =Books= Kitz's work at the museum led her to write the 1989 book Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion and the Road to Recovery.

The facility is located at USQ's Mount Kent Observatory, and saw first light in quarter two 2018. Commissioning of the facility was completed in mid-2019, and the facility was officially launched on 23 July 2019. The facility follows the innovative model first deployed in the northern hemisphere's Miniature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA)The homepage for MINERVA, a dedicated northern hemisphere exoplanet observatory., a northern hemisphere exoplanet facility located at the U.S. Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. MINERVA-Australis is being used to perform follow-up and characterisation observations of exoplanets discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS, which was launched in April, 2018. The project's principal investigator is USQ astronomer Rob Wittenmyer, who leads a consortium of partners from institutions across the world (UNSW Australia; Nanjing University; University of California, Riverside; MIT; George Mason University; University of Louisville; University of Texas at Austin; University of Florida).  Science objectives  The primary mission of MINERVA-Australis is to support observations carried out by the NASA TESS spacecraft, providing dedicated follow-up and characterisation of newly discovered exoplanets. During commissioning, the facility was used to pursue targets of opportunity, and to carry out work extending the baseline of the Anglo-Australian Planet Search program. MINERVA-Australis allows researchers to obtain precise radial velocity observations for target stars, enabling the masses of planets discovered by the TESS spacecraft to be directly measured, and has recently demonstrated a radial velocity precision of approximately 1 m/s. In addition to providing high precision velocity measurements, MINERVA- Australis will also offer high-cadence photometric observations. This is to facilitate direct follow-up transit observations of TESS candidate planets (particularly those in fields from which TESS has moved on). It can also enable the observation of occultation events and other transient targets-of- opportunity. During commissioning, observations made by the MINERVA-Australis array contributed to the discovery of 13 new exoplanets, working in collaboration with researchers at institutions across the globe.  The facility  MINERVA-Australis is to consist of six PlaneWave CDK700 telescopesTechnical specifications for the PlaneWave CDK700 telescopes, six of which will make up the MINERVA-Australis telescope array., of which five are installed and functional as of 23 July 2019. These 0.7 m telescopes have two ports, allowing each to be used for either spectroscopic or photometric observations. Each telescope sits in its own automated clam-shell Astrohaven domeDetails of Astrohaven's 12' domes. MINERVA-Australis uses six of the slightly larger, 12.5', domes to house its six telescopes, distributed in an approximate semi-circle around the main observatory building. Photometric work is to be carried out using Andor camerasDetails of the Andor iKon-L 936 camera, to be used by MINERVA-Australis., with 2k x 2k back illuminated CCDs with 15 µm pixels. These cameras offer an effective field of view > 20'. The six telescopes is to be connected by optical fibre to a stabilised, R = 75,000 echelle spectrograph with an iodine cell, designed by KiwiStar Optics. The first results from the facility are impressive, and demonstrate that the facility is working at the expected level of precision.

The settings of his artwork have formed the basis for the 2020 Amazon television drama series Tales from the Loop. Artwork Stålenhag grew up in a rural environment near Stockholm, and began illustrating local landscapes at a young age. He was inspired by different artists, including Lars Jonsson. Stålenhag experimented with science fiction artwork after discovering concept artists such as Ralph McQuarrie and Syd Mead; initially, this body of work was done as a side project, without any planning behind it. Thematically, his work often combines his childhood with themes from sci-fi movies, resulting in a stereotypical Swedish landscape with a neofuturistic bent. According to Stålenhag, this focus originates from his perceived lack of connection with adulthood, with the science fiction elements being added in part to draw audience attention and partly to influence the work's mood. These ideas result in a body of work that can feature giant robots and megastructures alongside regular Swedish items like Volvo and Saab cars. As his work has evolved, Stålenhag has created a backstory for it, focused around a governmental underground facility. In parallel with the real-life decline of the Swedish welfare state, large machines slowly fail, and the eventual result of this remains a mystery. In a 2013 interview with The Verge, Stålenhag said, \\"The only difference in the world of my art and our world is that ... ever since the early 20th century, attitudes and budgets were much more in favour of science and technology.\\" Outside of his usual canon, Stålenhag also drew 28 pictures of dinosaurs for the Swedish Museum of Natural History's prehistoric exhibits after he rediscovered his childhood interest in the creatures, and contacted the museum to see if he could do anything. In 2016, he followed this with pictures of hypothetical results of a rising ocean under climate change for Stockholm University's Resilience Centre. He also did some promotional artwork for the sci-fi video game No Man's Sky. Stålenhag uses a Wacom tablet and computer to illustrate his work, which is designed to resemble oil painting. Initially, he attempted to use various physical media to mimic a more traditional style, including gouache. Even after switching to digital methods, he has stated that he puts \\"a lot of effort into making the digital brushes behave naturally and preserve a certain amount of 'handwriting' in the brush strokes.\\" The majority of his work is based on pre-existing photographs that he takes; these are then used as a starting point for a number of rough sketches before the final work is completed. =Books= Most of Stålenhag's artwork was initially available online, before later being released for sale as prints. Since then, it has been turned into two narrative art books: Tales from the Loop (Swedish Ur Varselklotet) in 2014 and Things from the Flood (Swedish Flodskörden) in 2016. Both focus on the construction of a supermassive particle accelerator called the Loop. More recently, Stålenhag has covered the western United States in a third artbook, The Electric State, which was also crowdfunded via Kickstarter. It is centered around a girl and her robotic companion traversing the fictional state of Pacifica. Simon & Schuster published the UK edition in September 2018, and Skybound Books published a North American edition the following month. The Electric State (the Simon & Schuster edition) was one out of six finalists for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2019. Also in 2019, the Skybound edition was shortlisted for the Art Book category of the Locus Award. Adaptations In 2016, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to fund a tabletop role-playing game called Tales from the Loop, based on the book of the same name; multiple media outlets compared it to the TV series Stranger Things. Set in the 1980s and either the United States or Sweden, players roleplay as a group of teenagers dealing with the aftermath of the Loop. Different classes of characters are equivalent to stereotypical childhood roles, for example, \\"Jock\\", \\"Bookworm\\", or \\"Computer Geek\\". An English- language television series, Tales from the Loop, produced by Amazon Studios in conjunction with Fox 21 Television Studios, Indio Film, and 6th & Idaho Moving for Amazon Prime, was released in its entirety on 3 April 2020, and adapts elements from Stålenhag's narrative art books. The initial season comprises eight episodes of 50–57 minutes each. All screenplays were written by Nathaniel Halpern, while each episode had a unique director from a diverse pool, including Mark Romanek, Andrew Stanton, and Jodie Foster. The movie rights for The Electric State were sold to the Russo brothers in 2017, and the plans were most recently confirmed in 2019. Slated to direct and produce are It: Chapter One and Chapter Two creators Andy Muschietti and Barbara Muschietti, respectively. Other work As part of the crowdfunding campaign for The Electric State, Stålenhag produced and released an electronic music album with the same title as a backer goal. In 2018, he released his second album, Music for DOS, containing ambient music authored using old keyboards and the Impulse Tracker software package. Additionally, Stålenhag has been involved in a variety of advertisements, films, and video games. This includes his work on the platformer video game Ripple Dot Zero, which was done in collaboration with Tommy Salomonsson.

The city was called Nestum in the Natural History book that was written by Pliny the Elder. History Nashan, located near \\"Al-Khārid river\\" along with the neighboring Kaminahu, Haram and Nashaq in the region of al-Jawf, was a separate city state. Around 715 BC, it was initially annexed by Yitha'amar Watar I of Saba. Subsequently, Karib'il Watar (around 685 BC) launched a campaign to capture Nashan and Nashaq which lasted for three years. Eventually, he managed to subdue both cities, and to dedicate his triumph to his god Almaqah. A stela of Yatha' Amar Watar dated to about 715BC, tells that he invaded the area and took the town. It reads: > Yatha amar Watar son of Yakrubmalik mukarrib of Saba dedicated to Aranyada' > the patron when Aranyada came back from the territories of Aranyada' and of > Nashshan and avenged Nashshan at the expense of Kaminahu because Nashahn had > maintained the alliance of Almaqah and of Aranyada', of Yatha amar and of > Malikwaqah, of Saba of nashshan, because of ... of god and parton of pact > and alliance.Greg Fisher, Arabs and Empires Before Islam (Oxford University > Press, 2015 ) p 102.

It was proclaimed by Governor Richard MacDonnell in 1860 and named for Albert, Prince Consort of Queen Victoria.  Hundreds  A few years before the county was proclaimed, the Hundred of the Murray had been established to control land use immediately adjacent the river. This was abolished in 1860 and the county was proclaimed along with the five western riverside hundreds of Cadell, Randell (now Murbko), Paisley, Cooper (now Nildottie), and Giles (now Forster). Eight further hundreds were proclaimed to incorporated the entire county by 1912. The county is presently divided into hundreds as follows: * Along the left (east) bank of the Murray River proceeding southwards from the southward bend at Morgan are the hundreds of Cadell, Murbko, Paisley, Nildottie and Forster. * Along the same bank of the Murray proceeding eastwards from the east boundary of the Hundred of Cadell are the hundreds of Waikerie, Holder and Moorook. * South east of the riverlands in the Mallee region are the hundreds of Bakara, Mantung, Bandon, Chesson and Mindarie. Local governance The promulgation of the District Councils Act 1887 in January 1888 saw the hundred of Cadell form part of the new District Council of Morgan, the hundreds of Nildottie and Paisley form part of the new District Council of Blanchetown (later called Swan Reach), and the hundred of Forster added to the District Council of Caurnamont which had been established in 1885. A decade on, in 1898, the newly-gazetted hundreds of Murbko and Bakara were annexed by Blanchetown council. In 1910 the hundred of Moorook was incorporated into the new District Council of Loxton. Then, in 1913, the hundred of Mantung, was incorporated into Blanchetown. The following year, in 1914, the District Council of Waikerie was proclaimed as comprising the hundreds of Waikerie and Holder. In 1923 the District Council of East Murray was proclaimed as comprising the hundreds of Bandon, Chesson, Mindarie and northern portions of southerly adjacent hundreds of Wilson and McPherson in the County of Buccleuch. This brought under local governance the only remaining lands in the county without local-level government. In 1933, the hundred of Paisley was incorporated into the District Council of Waikerie and the hundred of Nildottie was incorporated into the new District Council of Keyneton and Swan Reach (later called Sedan). In 1935, the hundred of Forster was incorporated into the new District Council of Marne. In 1976 Marne amalgamated with Sedan bringing the hundreds of Nildottie and Forster under the local governance of the new District Council of Ridley until 1991. From 1991 to 1997 they were governed the District Council of Ridley-Truro and from 1997 by the Mid Murray Council. Three years on, in 1979, the amalgamation of East Murry and Karoonda saw the southern hundreds of Bandon, Chesson and Mindarie (as well as southern parts of Bakara and Mantung) incorporated into the new District Council of Karoonda East Murray.

This protein is found in the bone and is involved in calcium-binding, which occurs in order to harden (or calcify) the cartilage. Another one of its roles is to assemble the triple collagen helix, which is predominately entails the linkage of glycine and proline amino acids and then the twisting of those linkages. Chondrocalcin is important because cartilage calcification of the growth plate is one of the main occurrences in endochondral bone formation. Because of its importance, it is one of the most highly created polypeptides in human cartilage. This calcium-binding protein comes from chondrocytes, which are cells that produce and maintain cartilage. Some examples of chondrocytes include collagen and proteoglycans. The chondrocytes that produce chondrocalcin are typically found in growing bone matrices that have not yet matured. These immature bone matrices are found in the epiphyseal plate at both the lower hypertrophic zone and the longitudinal septa of the cartilaginous matrix. One study was conducted on fetal cartilage discovered that the chondrocalcin protein exists as a dimer with 35,000 g/mol subunits. The reason why fetal cartilage was used is because chondrocalcin cannot be detected in mature bone. Another investigation was conducted to determine the mechanism behind calcium binding in chondrocalcin. It was discovered that along with cartilage building, the protein also had a role in cartilage destruction.Hall, Brian. \\"Bones and Cartilage: Developmental and Evolutionary Skeletal Biology\\", Academic Press, 11 August 2005.Poole AR et al. \\"Chondrocalcin and the calcification of cartilage.

The route was named after Harbord Street even though only a small portion of the route was along the namesake street. One distinct characteristic of the route was its zip-zag nature, making many 90-degree turns onto the various streets along its route. The route was retired in 1966 when the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) opened the Bloor–Danforth subway line (today Line 2 Bloor–Danforth), the city's first east-west subway line. Evolution of the route Toronto Railway Company streetcar on the Harbord route Prior to the creation of the TTC in 1921, the Toronto Railway Company had a 30-year franchise to operate streetcar services in Toronto, and it was the TRC that established streetcar service on Harbord Street. Between 1910 and 1911, the TRC constructed tracks on Harbord Street between Spadina Avenue and Ossington Avenue. During that same period, the TRC laid tracks on Adelaide Street between Church Street and Spadina Avenue, and on Ossington Avenue between Harbord Street and Bloor Street. Thus, in 1911, the first version of the Harbord route came into operation from Church Street, west on Adelaide Street, north on Spadina Avenue, west on Harbord Street and north on Ossington Avenue to Bloor Street. In 1915, the TRC extended the Harbord route north of Bloor Street running north on Ossington Avenue, west on Hallam Street, north on Dufferin Street, west on Lappin Avenue to Lansdowne Avenue. There was a wye at the western end of the route at Lapin and Lansdowne avenues. At the eastern end streetcars looped from eastbound on Adelaide Street, north on Victoria Street, west on Richmond Street, south on Church Street returning to Adelaide Street westbound. This became the route that the TTC would inherit in 1921, when the TRC's franchise expired. On February 22 1923, the TTC extended the Harbord route from Lapin Avenue, north on Lansdowne Avenue to the new Royce Loop at the south-east corner of Royce Avenue (today Dupont Street) and Lansdowne Avenue. Starting October 23, 1927, the TTC had two versions of the Harbord route, one for Monday through Saturday with the eastern terminal at Adelaide and Church streets, and a substantially different route for Sundays. Both versions shared a common path west of Spadina Avenue. The eastbound Sunday route went south on Spadina Avenue, east on Dundas Street, north on Broadview Avenue, east on Gerard Street, north on Carlaw Avenue, east on Riverdale Avenue, north on Pape Avenue ending at the Lipton Loop at Lipton Avenue, one block north of Danforth Avenue. On April 3, 1933, the aforementioned Sunday route also became the Monday-to-Saturday route, and Harbord streetcars would not terminate at Adelaide and Church streets. The complete route from west to east from Royce Loop, south on Lansdowne Avenue, west on Lappin Avenue, south on Dufferin Street, east on Hallam Street, south on Ossington Avenue, east on Harbord Street, south on Spadina Avenue, east on Dundas Street, north on Broadview Avenue, east on Gerrard Street, north on Carlaw Avenue, east on Riverdale Avenue and north on Pape Avenue to Lipton Loop. Between the end loops, the route traveled on some portion of thirteen different streets, making 90-degree turns between each pair of streets. At that time, the Dundas streetcar route served only Dundas Street West, leaving Dundas Street East to be served by the Harbord streetcar. Westbound Harbord streetcar on Davenport Road at C.N.R. level crossing in February 1953 On December 8, 1945, the western terminal of the Harbord route was changed from Royce Loop to Townsley Loop, one block north of St. Clair Avenue, thus lengthening the western end of the route. With the expansion of trolley bus service, the Davenport streetcar was being replaced by the Ossington trolley bus on Ossington Avenue south of College Street, and by the Harbord streetcar north of Bloor Street. Streetcar service on Hallam Street and Lippin Avenue became redundant because of proximity to the Annette trolley bus line. Using pre-existing track, the revised western portion of the Harbord route ran from Ossington Avenue, west on Bloor Street, north on Dovercourt Road, west on Davenport Road, north on Old Weston Road to the Townsley Loop. On March 1, 1947, the Royce Loop was paved over to convert it from a streetcar to a trolley bus loop. For 10 days starting on November 19, 1956, day-time service on the western end of the Harbord route was cut back from Townsley Loop to a new St. Clarins Loop at St. Clarens Avenue and Davenport Road (south-east corner) under an Ontario Hydro right-of-way. This temporary cutback was for watermain maintenance. On January 21, 1957, the western end of the Harbord route was permanently cut back to the St. Clarins Loop. A bus loop had been added to the St. Clarins Loop. The City of Toronto wanted to replace the level crossing on Davenport Road between Caledonia Park Road and Wiltshire Avenue with an underpass. Until then, the level crossing had carried the tracks of the Harbord route. Tracks were never relaid in the new Davenport railway underpass. With this change, only the tracks on Bathurst Street would connect the St. Clair streetcar line to the rest of the Toronto streetcar system. Last years With the removal of tracks from the Davenport railway level crossing in January 1957, the Harbord route entered its final form. The route from east to west ran from Lipton Loop (Pape Avenue and Lipton Avenue, just north of Danforth Avenue), south on Pape Avenue, west on Riverdale Avenue, south on Carlaw Avenue, west on Gerrard Street, south on Broadview Avenue, west on Dundas Street, north on Spadina Avenue, west on Harbord Street, north on Ossington Avenue, west on Bloor Street, north on Dovercourt Road, west on Davenport Road to St. Clarins Loop at St. Clarens Avenue. The last day for the Harbord route was February 25, 1966, the day before the opening of the Bloor–Danforth subway line (today Line 2 Bloor–Danforth). Harbord was one of five streetcar routes abandoned with the opening of the subway; the others were Bloor, Fort (partly replaced by today's 511 Bathurst, Parliament and Coxwell. Surface routes were modified or created to serve former Harbord stops. The 72 Pape bus covered the route from Pape Street to Gerrard Street. The Dundas streetcar (today 505 Dundas) was extended onto Dundas Street East and then north on Broadview Avenue to Broadview station. Harbord Street was covered by the 94 Wellesley bus which connected to Ossington station. Various bus routes evolved to cover the Harbord route north of Bloor Street. Lipton Loop Lipton Loop in 1931 The Lipton Loop went into service on October 23, 1927, being used by the now defunct College streetcar as well as by the Sunday Harbord streetcar service. The loop was located at the north-east corner of Pape Avenue and Lipton Avenue, one block north of Danforth Avenue. The loop ran counter-clockwise. A bus service was established north on Pape Avenue from the Lipton Loop. This service was meant to be temporary. The Township of East York initially paved only the outside lanes, leaving the inside lanes unpaved for future streetcar tracks. When the Lipton Loop was built, there the intention to extend the streetcar tracks further north on Pape Avenue, over the Leaside Bridge into the Leaside industrial area via Millwood Road. For this purpose, the Leaside Bridge was built reinforced with extra steel to carry streetcar traffic. Also, there were short stubs for a double track extension at the north end of Lipton Loop. No further construction occurred because of Great Depression. Circa 1962, the Lipton Loop had to be modified to accommodate construction of Pape station on the Bloor–Danforth subway line. Streetcars entered the old loop via Lipton Avenue and ran counter-clockwise exiting near the south side of the building at 749 Pape Avenue. The new loop was slightly to the north of the old loop. Streetcars entered from Pape Avenue on the south side of the aforementioned building, turned through a lane on the east side of the building and exited on Gertrude Place to return to Pape Avenue.

History The map of the location of the Grey Ukraine. The Ukrainian settlement of Siryi Klyn (literally: the \\"grey wedge\\") developed around the city of Omsk in western Siberia. M. Bondarenko, an emigrant from Poltava province, wrote before World War I: \\"The city of Omsk looks like a typical Moscovite city, but the bazaar and markets speak Ukrainian\\". All around the city of Omsk stood Ukrainian villages. The settlement of people beyond the Ural mountains began in the 1860s. Altogether before 1914 1,604,873 emigrants from Ukraine settled the area. Historical Grey Ukraine exists roughly within the present-day northern Kazakhstan and southern Siberia. It is not contiguous with other territories inhabited by Ukrainian diaspora. A similar situation of territorial isolation exists with the Green Ukraine. Most of the Ukrainian migrations to Siberia happened during the late 19th century and early 20th century. However, the migrations continued throughout the Soviet period. Nikita Khrushchev's virgin lands campaign during the 1950s managed to encourage the migration. Demographics According to the 2010 Russian census, 77,884 people (2.7%) of the Omsk Oblast identified themselves as Ukrainians, making Ukrainians the third-largest ethnic group there, after Russians and Kazakhs.

Its political system is a multi-party system that includes having a President and Prime Minister. The economy of Peru has expanded substantially throughout the years making it one of the fastest growing economies. As described by Gøsta Esping-Andersen, in his book The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, the Peruvian welfare system would most commonly fit in with the liberal model, since Peru mostly attempts to emancipate the less fortunate from poverty, through means of state- cultivated programs. In accordance, the welfare system has shown great expansion, with the focus primarily on education, healthcare, and the creation of a social safety net.  Healthcare  The Peruvian healthcare system is decentralized and composed of five entities charged with its administration. These five entities are made up of The Ministry of Health (also known as MINSA), which provides for about 60% of the population. Then there is EsSalud, which covers 30% of the population, and the approximate 10% left is collectively provided for by the Armed Forces (FFAA), the National Police and private sectors. Peru has struggled with disparity on the various facets of health coverage, such as the gap between providing services to the rich versus the poor, and access to healthcare facility locations. Despite these setbacks, the evolution of healthcare was marked as a major and influential recovery of private and public expenditures in healthcare. Continuing in pursuit of equity, Peru has managed to achieve high levels of coverage in basic healthcare, with the creation of programs, but while coverage is high, the quality of these remains relatively low.  Education  Education in Peru is overseen by Ministry of Education and consists of primary, secondary and tertiary education. The first two are compulsory and the latter equal to higher education. Since education is said to be an important factor of production, investment in education facilitates equality and opportunity. The Peruvian government has ventured towards decreasing the lingering unequal opportunity in obtaining education by creating programs like BECA 18, which helps youths from poor families attend school, and Jóvenes productive y double oportunidad, which aims to help school leavers get back into school. These programs are attempting to widen access to education and help in expanding the economy. = Vocational training = According to the OECD's review of vocational training and education, Peru is seen as a rapidly progressing country with respect to education and training programs. Peru has a vast array of vocational training programs that aim to teach workers job-specific skills. Since these skills are commended by employers, these programs obtain strong support from them.  Unemployment  Unemployment benefits are not required by law to be dispersed by the government, but should be given out by private- sector employers in the form of severance pay. In the case of Peru, severance pay is distributed in the event of wrongful termination. Peru is also one of the countries that have set a limit on severance pay. While most payments come out of companies' internal funds, there are cases in which countries have individual external accounts. In Peru, this is called Compensation for time of service (CTS). CTS can also be seen as a method of forced savings or funds put away by employers that hire workers to work four or more hours a day. CTS is distributed as a result of termination or migration to a new job.  Other forms of social protection  = Pensions = Pensions in Peru consist of social insurance (SNP) and the Individual account, both of which cover public or private sector employees. The average pension in 2014 was $984 soles (about US$350) per month and paid only to those holding a certain balance in their personal bank accounts. Pensions are looked after by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and are given to elderly citizens over the age of 65 who have contributed at least 20 years to the labour market.  Pension65  Pension65 was a program created to respond to the growing vulnerable population, mainly those living in poverty, with a distribution of generally $250 soles (about the US$77.31) every two months for every qualifying citizen.  Social insurance  Within SNP, an insured individual may receive as much as 13% of gross earnings, a non-insured person (self-employed) will receive 13% of gross declared income. To receive old-age pensions a citizen is required to be at least 65 years old and must have contributed 20 years of contributions. The early pension is different depending of the gender, men have to be at leasy 55 years old with at least 30 years of contribution and women are required to at least be 50 with 25 years of contributions. The disability pension is only given when you had been employed when the disability began and can require anywhere between three and fifteen years of contributions. Survivor pension means that the insured received or qualified to receive a pension, eligible survivors to receive pensions are limited but can include widowers and children under the age of 18.  Individual account  The SPP is fairly similar to social insurance with some distinctions. To obtain SPP, you can obtain distributions at the age of 65 or when the individual account has reached 50% of indexed earnings. The disability pension is paid so long as the insured party has lost at least 50% of total income and cannot qualify to obtain old-age pension. Survivor pension can be distributed to a widow or partner and children under the age of 18. = Cash transfers = JUNTOS is Peru's conditional cash transfer program that began in 2005 and has grown exponentially, approximately reaching 37,000 families in need. Similar to many cash transfer programs, JUNTOS objective lies in minimizing poverty through cash dispersion and ultimately, over time, to stop the passing of poverty down the generations by improving human capital through equal access to education and healthcare. JUNTOS holds conditions one must meet to receive the benefit, which is non-differentiated throughout households (all households get the same amount of cash transfer, $10 soles, approximately US$30). Conditions may be but are not limited to, children maintaining health and nutrition and attending school for a certain time each year. It can also include being in the lower part of the poverty gap, belonging to a very poor demographic, and being exposed to a dangerous or violent environment. Peruvian cash transfers can be correlated to the process of commodification, alienating those from market dependency, by providing income regardless of employment.

Owned by the city of Cleveland and maintained by Cleveland Metroparks, the trail runs along the former track bed of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad. The trail is named for The Cleveland Foundation, a local community foundation which donated $5 million toward the trail's construction. The southern leg of the trail opened in August 2015, and the northern leg in August 2017. The middle leg will begin construction once the Irishtown Bend hillside is stabilized. A bridge connecting the trail to Whiskey Island will begin construction in Spring 2019 and will be completed in early Summer 2020. Railroad and associated infrastructure The Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad (C&M; later the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad) was founded in 1848 and authorized to build a line from Cleveland to Warren, Ohio, and then into Pennsylvania. The railroad intended to connect with the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad on the Lake Erie shore in Cleveland. This required crossing from the east to west bank of the Cuyahoga River, but a crossing was not immediately constructed. This left the tracks ending near Kingsbury Run on the east bank of the river. The Atlantic and Great Western Railroad leased the C&M; in July 1863, and agreed to complete the line. Work on a new passenger depot on the Scranton Flats began in August 1863, and the tracks over the river to the new depot were completed on November 4. In March 1880, the Atlantic & Great Western emerged from bankruptcy as a new company, the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad (NYP&O;). In the spring of 1886, the NYP&O; extended the tracks in Cleveland by crossing the western part of the Scranton Flats, curving around Irishtown Bend, and crossing \\"the Angle\\" (the next peninsula) to bridge the Old Ship Channel of the Cuyahoga River and reach Whiskey Island and the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad. Trains began running July 4. Docks and a freight depot were built on either side of Columbus Road on Irishtown Bend. The NYP&O;'s rail yards extended for nearly along the southwest bank of the Old Ship Channel, around Irishtown Bend, and through Tremont. More docks were built just north of where the tracks curved westward to pass under the Superior Viaduct. The railroad built a new, steam-operated dock and coal tipple in 1912 at what is now the western abutment of the Detroit-Superior Bridge. Traffic along the Cuyahoga River in this area was so extensive, the C&M; had a rail yard eight tracks wide along Irishtown Bend to accommodate it. In 1914, construction began on the Detroit-Superior Bridge at the north end of Irishtown Bend. The railroad dock was moved upstream in 1917 to accommodate construction of the western abutments of the bridge, and the railroad tracks routed to run beneath one of the bridge's arches. =Track removal and track bed sales= In 1982, Conrail (the successor to the C&M;) removed of track in Cleveland, from the terminus on Whiskey Island to the Von Willer Yard (at E. 93rd Street and Harvard Avenue).; A portion of the track was lost to road construction. Riverbed Street was a single-lane road running parallel to the most inland of the old C&M; tracks on Irishtown Bend. The road was widened to two lanes in 1985, with the new eastern lane covering the main line of the former C&M; track. In July 1993, Conrail sold the former C&M; rail yard on Whiskey Island to Whiskey Island Partners, a real estate development corporation, for $1.6 million ($ in dollars). The private company spent $300,000 moving Conrail's track off the island. In December 2004, Cuyahoga County purchased this land, as well as the rest of Whiskey Island, for $6.25 million ($ in dollars). The county used most of the peninsula to create Wendy Park. The track bed from the south bank of the Old Ship Channel to the Cuyahoga River opposite Kingsbury Run was sold to Westbank Development Corp., a for-profit company founded by local real estate investor Earl Walker. Creating the trail =Genesis of the trail idea= In 1987, Dr. Alfred M. Lee, an archeologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, began a three-year-long series of archeological digs at Irishtown Bend. The dig site covered 80 former residential lots between Riverbed Street, Franklin Avenue, Columbus Road, and the no longer extant Russia Street. The dig uncovered extensive evidence regarding the type of structures built in the neighborhood and the economics, foodways, living conditions, and social status of those living in the area. The archeological digs generated interest in preserving the site and making it accessible to the public. A study of this and other preservation issues along the Cuyahoga River valley was funded in 1990 by BP America, The Cleveland Foundation, and The George Gund Foundation. After two years of work by six governmental planning agencies, the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission released a report in April 1992 that recommended an series of parks, protected areas, trails, and other new infrastructure to connect Lake Erie with the Cuyahoga Valley National Park to the south of Cleveland. Regarding Irishtown Bend, the report advocated a biking and hiking trail to link the area with Whiskey Island to the north and the Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail in the south. The study also recommended funding for additional archaeological digs at the Bend. Although businesses located further south on the west bank of the Cuyahoga River wanted a new, four-lane \\"West Bank connector\\" road through Irishtown Bend that would give them faster access to local highways, Cleveland planners (updating the city's Civic Vision master plan) instead began planning to turn Riverbed Street into a biking-hiking path and converting the area into a public park. =Irishtown Bend stability issues= Near Columbus Road, half of Riverbed Street has subsided several feet due to geologic instability. The west bank of the Cuyahoga River at Irishtown Bend has been noticeably unstable since the late 1880s. Soil, geology, the steepness of the hill, and water in the soil work together to push soil into the river until equilibrium is reached. Generally speaking, the slide has been extremely slow, at most a few inches a year. At times it may even be dormant. When the soil is particularly wet or pressure is put on it from above (by adding new fill dirt or by constructing buildings on the soil), the hillside can slip as much as several feet a year. About 2004 or 2005, the Irishtown Bend hill began to subside at a significantly higher rate. In November 2005, major cracks appeared in Riverbed Street. The city repaved the street in January 2006, major cracks reappeared only two weeks later. The city ordered the street closed as a safety measure. Cleveland and Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) officials began a series of meetings with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), and United States Coast Guard to discussion options. Four technical studies predicted that the slippage would only worsen. The Corps began studying the hillside more extensively in 2007 and 2008, and issued a report in January 2009 which concluded that a very real danger existed of the Irishtown Bend hill collapsing suddenly into the Cuyahoga River. With the instability of the Irishtown Bend making it increasingly clear that the area should not be used for residences or industry, the city of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, several nonprofit organizations, and landowners at Irishtown Bend began parallel discussions in 2006 about the future of the area and the abandoned C&M; railroad track bed. The George Gund Foundation assisted these talks by contributing a $740,000 ($ in dollars) planning grant. In January 2009, these groups issued a report, the \\"Flats Connections Plan\\". ParkWorks, a Cleveland nonprofit, wrote one part of the plan, which advocated turning the abandoned track bed between Kingsbury Run and Whiskey Island into a biking- hiking trail. The plan also included the construction of a new pedestrian bridge over the Old Ship Channel of the Cuyahoga River to reconnect the tracks with the old C&M; rail yard (now part of Wendy Park). CMG Landscape Architecture, a San Francisco-based landscape architecture firm, authored the remainder of the plan, which proposed converting Irishtown Bend into park, playground, and wetlands. =Buying land and designing the trail= Negotiations to obtain title to the C&M; trackbed began in 2008. The Trust for Public Land (TPL), a national nonprofit which coordinates and facilities the creation of parkland, negotiated on behalf of the group with Westbank Development Corp. On December 28, 2009, TPL purchased for $3.2 million ($ in dollars) title and an easement covering of former C&M; trackbed between the Old Ship Channel and the Cuyahoga River near Kingsbury Run. Westbank Development donated $2 million ($ in dollars) worth of the purchase price to ParkWorks. ParkWorks provided the rest of the purchase price after receiving a $1.2 million ($ in dollars) grant from the Clean Ohio Conservation Fund. Initial design work for what was then called the Lake Link Trail was funded by a $215,000 ($ in dollars) grant from The George Gund Foundation. ParkWorks used the money to hire design and engineering consultants, complete an initial design, make cost estimates, and identify funding sources. On November 7, 2011, The George Gund Foundation gave $2 million ($ in dollars) to the project, and The Cleveland Foundation followed up in August 2014 with a $5 million ($ in dollars) gift. In honor of the latter donation, Cleveland Metroparks, designer, builder, and eventual maintainer of the trail, said the path would be renamed the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail. =Construction= Looking north from Washington Avenue at the north leg of the trail. By fall of 2014, the trail design effort by Cleveland Metroparks was nearing completion, land clearance had begun, and about $8 million ($ in dollars) trail and bridge construction costs had been raised. Cleveland Metroparks said it would build the trail in four stages. The first stage would be across the Scranton Peninsula, from Scranton Road to Columbus Road. The federal government awarded a $3.3 million grant for trail construction in January 2015. The Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority took the lead in identifying a solution for stabilizing the soil at Irishtown Bend. In February 2015, the long-awaited Port Authority report was released. The study was conducted by the firm of Barr and Prevost and took 17 months at a cost of $282,000 ($ in dollars). Barr and Prevost recommended that Metroparks delay building the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail along Irishtown Bend until the hillside stabilization issues had been identified and a permanent solution implemented. The south leg of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail opened on August 13, 2015. The dedication was attended by United States Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. In June 2016, the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) made an $80,000 ($ in dollars) grant to Cleveland Metroparks to enable it to begin planning for hillside stabilization and the creation of the park and middle section of the trail. Cleveland Metroparks won an $850,000 ($ in dollars) Clean Ohio grant in October 2016 to cover construction, design, and engineering costs of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail. Cleveland Metroparks began construction on the northern section of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail in August 2016. The track bed, large portions of which were in a cut below street level, had been partially filled by illegal dumping, and the portion under Main Avenue was under water. As construction began, Ohio City Inc. (a nonprofit community development corporation) led the city of Cleveland, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority, and LAND Studio in a $125,000 ($ in dollars) planning effort to begin the work of designing the park and the trail that would run through it. The second segment of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail opened on June 9, 2017. The proposed park design was submitted to the Cleveland Planning Commission on September 1, 2017. The park, and the middle leg of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail, remain on hold pending approval of the design and the securing of funds for hillside stabilization. =Old Ship Channel bridge= The Cuyahoga County Planning Commission initially supervised planning for the pedestrian bridge linking the trail to Whiskey Island. The county received a $159,000 ($ in dollars) federal grant and $80,000 ($ in dollars) in private contributions to plan the bridge, and by June 2011 was considering three designs by architect Miguel Rosales: A traditional suspension bridge, a Fink truss bridge, and a cable-stayed bridge with curving beams overhead. Cleveland Metroparks took over the bridge planning effort in the fall of 2014. Not using the bridge design work previously conducted by the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission, Metroparks began soliciting new designs for the pedestrian and bicycle bridge over the Old Ship Channel. By October 2014, four bridge design teams had been selected as finalists: Columbus-based DLZ/Paris-based RFR Engineers; Elyria-based KS Associates/Parsons Brinckerhoff; Pittsburgh-based Michael Baker International/Skip Smallridge; Miguel Rosales/Schlaich Bergermann Partner/Osborn Engineering. By June 2015, the Rosales/Schlaich Bergermann/Osborn Engineering design had been chosen as the preferred alternative. The cost of construction was estimated at $6 million ($ in dollars). The Whiskey Island bike and pedestrian bridge design effort slowed in late 2015 and early 2016. Cleveland Metroparks officials said in February 2016 that work on the bridge had been delayed after the agency decided to make \\"compromises in the design\\". By July 2016, The Plain Dealer newspaper was calling the design \\"diluted\\". The design changes came about due to the rising cost of implementing the winning design. To rein in costs, Metroparks decided to upgrade the existing Willow Avenue Bridge so that it could be used by cyclists and pedestrians. While retaining the Fink truss design proposed by the winning team, this shortened the bridge to just . In August 2016, Cleveland Metroparks won a $7.95 million ($ in dollars) Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant from the federal government to pay for the bridge's construction costs. Cleveland Metroparks said it would seek bids to build the Whiskey Island pedestrian bridge before the end of 2017. The agency also said it hoped to begin construction in the summer of 2018, and complete work at the end of 2019. Description of the trail The trail is owned by the city of Cleveland and maintained by Cleveland Metroparks. The , $2.5 million ($ in dollars) northern leg of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail starts in the north near the intersection of River Road and Mulberry Avenue. It runs southeast between Center Street and Mulberry Avenue. Curving to a more south-southeast direction at Main Avenue, it passes beneath the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway, Main Avenue, Winslow Avenue, and Washington Avenue before piercing an arch of the Old Superior Viaduct. For much of this portion of the route, the trail is enclosed in a trench lined with stone retaining walls. The southern leg of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail starts at Columbus Road. The trail, which is at ground level, curves across the Scranton Flats before passing beneath the Hope Memorial Bridge. Two new bridges allow it to pass over the tracks of the Flats Industrial Railroad and Scranton Road, before it joins the Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail near the intersection of University and Scranton Roads.

The questions of what such a world might look like, and whether specific scenarios constitute utopias or dystopias, are the subject of lively debate.  Background  Most scientists believe that AI research will at some point lead to the creation of machines that are as intelligent, or more intelligent, than human beings in every domain of interest.Müller, Vincent C., and Nick Bostrom. \\"Future progress in artificial intelligence: A survey of expert opinion.\\" Fundamental issues of artificial intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2016. 553-570. There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains; therefore superintelligence is physically possible. In addition to potential algorithmic improvements over human brains, a digital brain can be many orders of magnitude larger and faster than a human brain, which was constrained in size by evolution to be small enough to fit through a birth canal. While there is no consensus on when artificial intelligence will outperform humans, many scholars argue that whenever it does happen, the introduction of a second species of intelligent life onto the planet will have far-reaching implications. Scholars often disagree with one another both about what types of post-AI scenarios are most likely, and about what types of post-AI scenarios would be most desirable. Finally, some dissenters argue that AI will never become as intelligent as humans, for example because the human race will already likely have destroyed itself before research has time to advance sufficiently to create artificial general intelligence.  Postulates: robot labor and post-scarcity economy  All of the following \\"AI aftermath scenarios\\" of the aftermath of arbitrarily-advanced AI development are crucially dependent on two intertwined theses. The first thesis is that, at some point in the future, some kind of economic growth will continue until a \\"post-scarcity\\" economy is reached that could, unless extremely hyperconcentrated, effortlessly provide an extremely comfortable standard of living for a population equaling or, within reason, exceeding the current human population, without even requiring the bulk of the population to participate in the workforce. This economic growth could come from the continuation of existing growth trends and the refinement of existing technologies, or through future breakthroughs in emerging technologies such as nanotechnology and automation through robotics and futuristic advanced artificial intelligence. The second thesis is that advances in artificial intelligence will render humans unnecessary for the functioning of the economy: human labor declines in relative economic value if robots are easier to cheaply mass-produce then humans, more customizable than humans, and if they become more intelligent and capable than humans. = Cosmic endowment and limits to growth = The Universe may be spatially infinite; however, the accessible Universe is bounded by the cosmological event horizon of around 16 billion light years.Ćirković, Milan M. \\"Forecast for the next eon: Applied cosmology and the long-term fate of intelligent beings.\\" Foundations of Physics 34.2 (2004): 239-261.Olson, S. Jay. \\"Homogeneous cosmology with aggressively expanding civilizations.\\" Classical and Quantum Gravity 32.21 (2015): 215025. Some physicists believe it plausible that nearest alien civilization may well be located more than 16 billion light years away;Tegmark, Max. \\"Our mathematical universe.\\" Allen Lane-Penguin Books, London (2014).John Gribbin. Alone in the Universe. New York, Wiley, 2011. in this best-case expansion scenario, the human race could eventually, by colonizing a significant fraction of the accessible Universe, increase the accessible biosphere by perhaps 32 orders of magnitude. The twentieth century saw a partial \\"demographic transition\\" to lower birthrates associated with wealthier societies; however, in the very long run, intergenerational fertility correlations (whether due to natural selection or due to cultural transmission of large-family norms from parents to children) are predicted to result in an increase in fertility over time, in the absence of either mandated birth control or periodic Malthusian catastrophes.  AI aftermath scenarios  = Libertarianism = Libertarian scenarios postulate that intelligent machines, uploaded humans, cyborgs, and unenhanced humans will coexist peacefully in a framework focused on respecting property rights. Because industrial productivity is no longer gated by scarce human labor, the value of land skyrockets compared to the price of goods; even remaining \\"Luddite\\" humans who owned or inherited land should be able to sell or lease a small piece of it to the more-productive robots in exchange for a perpetual annuity sufficient to easily indefinitely meet all of their basic financial needs. Such people can live as long as they choose to, and are free to engage in almost any activity they can conceive of, for pleasure or for self- actualization, without financial concern. Advanced technologies enable entirely new modes of thought and experience, thus adding to the palette of possible feelings. People in the future may even experience never-ending \\"gradients of bliss\\". Such decentralized scenarios may be unstable in the long run, as the greediest elements of the superintelligent classes would have both the means and the motive to usurp the property of the unenhanced classes. Even if the mechanisms for ensuring legal property rights are both unbreakable and loophole-free, there may still be an ever-present danger of humans and cyborgs being \\"tricked\\" by the cleverest of the superintelligent machines into unwittingly signing over their own property. Suffering may be widespread, as sentient beings without property may die, and no mechanism prevents a being from reproducing up until the limits of his own inheritable resources, resulting in a multitude of that being's descendants scrabbling out an existence of minimal sustenance. =Benevolent dictator= alt=A lush island floats surreally in the area In this scenario, postulate that a superintelligent artificial intelligence takes control of society, but acts in a beneficial way. Its programmers, despite being on a deadline, solved quasi- philosophical problems that had seemed to some intractable, and created an AI with the following goal: to use its superintelligence to figure out what human utopia looks like by analyzing human behavior, human brains, and human genes; and then, to implement that utopia. The AI arrives at a subtle and complex definition of human flourishing. Valuing diversity, and recognizing that different people have different preferences, the AI divides Earth into different sectors. Harming others, making weapons, evading surveillance, or trying to create a rival superintelligence are globally banned; apart from that, each sector is free to make its own laws; for example, a religious person might choose to live in the \\"pious sector\\" corresponding to his religion, where the appropriate religious rules are strictly enforced. In all sectors, disease, poverty, crime, hangovers, addiction, and all other involuntary suffering have been eliminated. Many sectors boast advanced architecture and spectacle that \\"make typical sci-fi visions pale in comparison\\". Life is an \\"all-inclusive pleasure cruise\\", as if it were \\"Christmas 365 days a year\\". Still, many people are dissatisfied. Humans have no freedom in shaping their collective destiny. Some want the freedom to have as many children as they want. Others resent surveillance by the AI, or chafe at bans on weaponry and on creating further superintelligence machines. Others may come to regret the choices they have made, or find their lives feel hollow and superficial. =Gatekeeper AI= In \\"Gatekeeper\\" AI scenarios, the AI can act to prevent rival superintelligences from being created, but otherwise errs on the side of allowing humans to create their own destiny. Ben Goertzel of OpenCog has advocated a \\"Nanny AI\\" scenario where the AI additionally takes some responsibility for preventing humans from destroying themselves, for example by slowing down technological progress to give time for society to advance in a more thoughtful and deliberate manner. In a third scenario, a superintelligent \\"Protector\\" AI gives humans the illusion of control, by hiding or erasing all knowledge of its existence, but works behind the scenes to guarantee positive outcomes. In all three scenarios, while humanity gains more control (or at least the illusion of control), humanity ends up progressing more slowly than it would if the AI were unrestricted in its willingness to rain down all the benefits of its advanced technology on the human race. =Boxed AI= alt=Pandora attempts to close the box The AI Box scenario postulates that a superintelligent AI can be \\"confined to a box\\" and its actions can be restricted by human gatekeepers; the humans in charge would try to take advantage of some of the AI's scientific breakthroughs or reasoning abilities, without allowing the AI to take over the world. Successful gatekeeping may be difficult; the more intelligent the AI is, the more likely the AI can find a clever way to use \\"social hacking\\" and convince the gatekeepers to let it escape, or even to find an unforeseen physical method of escape. =Human-AI merger= Kurzweil argues that in the future \\"There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality\\". =Human extinction= If a dominant superintelligent machine were to conclude that human survival is an unnecessary risk or a waste of resources, the result would be human extinction. This could occur if a machine, programmed without respect for human values, unexpectedly gains superintelligence through recursive self- improvement, or manages to escape from its containment in an AI Box scenario. This could also occur if the first superintelligent AI was programmed with an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of human values, either because the task of instilling the AI with human values was too difficult or impossible; due to a buggy initial implementation of the AI; or due to bugs accidentally being introduced, either by its human programmers or by the self-improving AI itself, in the course of refining its code base. Bostrom and others argue that human extinction is probably the \\"default path\\" that society is currently taking, in the absence of substantial preparatory attention to AI safety. The resultant AI might not be sentient, and might place no value on sentient life; the resulting hollow world, devoid of life, might be like \\"a Disneyland without children\\". =Zoo= Jerry Kaplan, author of Humans Need Not Apply, posits a scenario where humans are farmed or kept on a reserve, just as humans preserve endangered species like chimpanzees. Apple co-founder and AI skeptic Steve Wozniak stated in 2015 that robots taking over would actually \\"be good for the human race\\", on the grounds that he believes humans would become the robots' pampered pets.  Alternatives to AI  Some scholars doubt that \\"game-changing\\" superintelligent machines will ever come to pass. Gordon Bell of Microsoft Research has stated \\"the population will destroy itself before the technological singularity\\". Gordon Moore, discoverer of the eponymous Moore's law, stated \\"I am a skeptic. I don't believe this kind of thing is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way.\\" Evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker stated, \\"The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible.\\" Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems, in his April 2000 essay Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, has advocated for global \\"voluntary relinquishment\\" of artificial general intelligence and other risky technologies. Most experts believe relinquishment is extremely unlikely. AI skeptic Oren Etzioni has stated that researchers and scientists have no choice but to push forward with AI developments: \\"China says they want to be an AI leader, Putin has said the same thing. So the global race is on.\\"  References  See also * Existential risk from artificial general intelligence Futures studies Philosophy of artificial intelligence Technological change ","title":"AI aftermath scenarios"},{"id":"55962935","text":"Bowman in 1973 Willard L.

It has a single tubular, green to yellowish-green leaf and up to thirty bright green to brownish-green flowers. It is a very rare orchid, only found in a single location with a population which fluctuates from three to two hundred flowering plants. Description Prasophyllum olidum, commonly known as the pungent leek orchid is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped, green to yellowish-green leaf which is long and wide near its reddish base. Between ten and thirty bright green to brownish-green flowers are crowded along a flowering spike which is long. The flowers are wide and wide. As with other leek orchids, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance- shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide and turns downwards. The lateral sepals are linear, long, about wide and free from each other. The petals are narrow linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide. The labellum is long, wide and turns sharply upwards near its middle. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum are slightly wavy and there is a thick, fleshy green callus in its centre. Flowering occurs in late November and December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum olidum was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Campbell Town and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (olidum) is a Latin word meaning \\"smelling\\" or \\"odorous\\". Distribution and habitat The pungent leek orchid grows in native grassland in an area near Campbell Town at an altitude of . Conservation Prasophyllum olidum is only known from a small area of a single private property. The population varies depending on rainfall. In 1995 the population was estimated to be about 200 but in 2011, following below average winter rains, the population was only three. It is classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and as Critically Endangered under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the population are habitat disturbance and inappropriate fire regimes.

It stars Chris Messina and Abigail Spencer as two depressed people who make a road trip to commit suicide at the Golden Gate Bridge. Plot After a long day with no sales, depressed ice cream salesman Kenny Parker meets Lolita Nowicki, an actuary, at a bridge. The two discuss their suicidal feelings and discover they have the same therapist, Frank. Amused by the coincidence, they walk through Chicago, discussing the various forms of therapy suggested by Frank. As they pass a hotel, a man in a Mercedes mistakes Kenny for a valet and hands him his keys. Lolita grabs them and encourages Kenny to join her in a road trip to the Golden Gate Bridge, where they can both commit suicide. Kenny hesitates, assuring Lolita that he has something to live for, but he can not provide an answer when she prompts him. Their first stop is at a convenience store, where Lolita impulsively tells the clerk that Kenny has a gun. The clerk apologetically says that he must see the gun before he can give them any money. When they admit that they do not have one, he gives them free chewing gum. After leaving, Kenny complains of feeling embarrassed, but Lolita says he is boring and takes too few chances in life. Kenny notices two hillbilly hitchhikers by the side of the road and comments on how unlikely it is they will receive a ride. Lolita demands that he stop and do so. The hitchhikers, Marlon and Brandon, decline their offer. Annoyed that her good deed is rebuffed, Lolita attempts to convince them to get in car. They continue to refuse until Kenny impulsively says he has a gun. Although confused whether they are being kidnapped or given a ride, the men say they are traveling to a UFO museum to scatter the ashes of Marlon's grandmother. Affected their hard-luck tale, Lolita gives them the Mercedes without consulting Kenny. When Lolita again calls Kenny boring, he surprises her by stealing a car. To her horror, they find a human kidney in storage on the back seat. A cell phone in the car reveals that the kidney is overdue for a transplant, and they take it there. On the way, they are stopped for speeding. Lolita convinces the cops to give them a police escort. At the hospital, the patient's family embraces and thanks them. Believing Kenny to be a good person, Lolita tries to initiate sex when they stop at a hotel, but Kenny awkwardly explains that he is impotent. Nonetheless, they become closer emotionally. The county sheriff comes to tell them the kidney transplant was a success, but that he knows the car is stolen. He drops them off at a bus station to leave town. On the bus, Kenny checks Lolita's cell phone and discovers Frank has been sending her text messages. Kenny accuses her of having sex with Frank; insulted, she leaves his company and gets a ride at a gas station with several men while Kenny continues on the bus. On the side of the road, Kenny sees Lolita fighting with the men. He gets off the bus and confronts them, almost getting beat up. Lolita produces a pistol, and they back off. When one continues to insult Lolita, Kenny forces the man to give Lolita a heart-felt apology at gunpoint. Impressed, Lolita suggests they continue traveling together. They stop to question Kenny's ex-fiancee about why she left him at the altar, learning that she left him because he was directionless. Marlon and Brandon pick them up in the Mercedes, and they drive the rest of the way to the museum together. Marlon and Brandon give them back the Mercedes when they learn it is stolen, and Kenny and Lolita proceed to California. Lolita pays for a luxury suite at a high class hotel, explaining that their road trip would have been pointless had she previously used her credit card. Kenny helps Lolita reconcile with her mother, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The two have sex. When Kenny wakes, he realizes Lolita is gone, and he rushes to the Golden Gate Bridge.

Programs and Events In addition to the programs and events noted in the #Members and Participants section, the CoFC was involved with numerous other activities. The National Centennial of Flight Kick-off event, was held December 17, 2002—a year before the 100th anniversary of the Wright flight—at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, in Washington, D.C.. It included a Presidential proclamation and the recognition of numerous aviation and aerospace pioneers, with presentations from Chairman Dailey, actor/aviator John Travolta, FAA Administrator Marion Blakey, and NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe. On the same day, in North Carolina, a commemoration was held near Kitty Hawk—a daylong anniversary tribute at the site of the Wrights' first flight, the Wright Brothers National Memorial, at Kill Devil Hills.

The Commission claimed the website provided \\"the most up-to- date information on celebration activity, as well as the most comprehensive collection of outstanding educational essays, multimedia and links regarding the history of flight.\\" The site's development and operation consumed about four-million dollars, of mostly federal funds, but became very popular during the Centennial year, peaking at over 4 million visitors per month by December 2003 (the 100th Anniversary month). The site was maintained at the internet domain centennialofflight.gov by NASA. Following the closing of the CoFC in April 2004, responsibility for the site transferred to the NASA History Office, who maintained the site online, basically unchanged, until budget cutbacks and server-computer problems motivated its abandonment by NASA in September 2012. Various parties salvaged parts of the site, including the American Aviation Historical Society (AAHS), who acquired copies of the computer code for the site from NASA. In 2013, a member of AAHS donated the domain name centennialofflight.netto AAHS, to accommodate an archive—maintained by AAHS—of the original official Centennial of Flight website. AAHS made structural \\"clean-ups\\" to the site (removing broken links and obsolete calendar data), and initiating other edits, highlighted with dark red lettering. Termination The Commission closed in 2004, following the end of its scheduled functions. As part of the Commission's charter, there were provisions for certain material to be preserved, particularly the large website, which was assigned to the NASA History Office.

The DOH vaccinated schoolchildren with Sanofi Pasteur's Dengvaxia vaccine against Dengue fever. The program was stopped when Sanofi Pasteur advised the government that the vaccine could put previously uninfected people at a somewhat higher risk of a severe case of dengue fever. A political controversy erupted over whether the program was run with sufficient care and who should be held responsible for the alleged harm to the vaccinated children. In late November 2017, the DOH suspended the school-based vaccination program. As of August 2019, over 600 people (mostly children) that had received at least a single dose of the vaccine had died, though not necessarily caused by the vaccine itself. The DOH has since banned the vaccine's use and sale in the Philippines. The scare caused by the controversy has been suggested as a factor in the country's loss of confidence in vaccines and low immunization rates, resulting in an infectious disease crisis in the country in 2019, including a measles outbreak. Dengvaxia is approved for sale in 19 countries including the European Union and the United States, and has saved an estimated 1 million lives.  Events  President Aquino converses with Sanofi Pasteur CEO Olivier Charmeil during a courtesy call on December 1, 2015 in Paris, France. On December 1, 2015, former President Benigno Aquino III met with executives of Sanofi Pasteur in a courtesy call in Paris, making the Philippines the first Asian country to approve the commercial sale of Dengvaxia. President Benigno Aquino III at the launching of the dengue vaccine school-based immunization program. In April 2016, the DOH, launched the dengue vaccination campaign in Central Luzon, Calabarzon and Metro Manila, where about 700,000 individuals received at least one dose of the vaccine. The government paid P3.5-billion for the vaccine. On November 29, 2017, French drugmaker Sanofi Pasteur released a statement stating that their Dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, posed risk to individuals vaccinated without having a prior dengue infection. This came some time after reports circulated of children dying allegedly from complications associated with the vaccine. Soon after, the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) suspended the vaccination on FCS program based in schools owing to the said concern, with DOH Secretary Francisco Duque saying \\"In the light of this new analysis, the DOH will place the dengue vaccination on hold while review and consultation is ongoing with experts, key stakeholders and the World Health Organization.\\" On December 2, 2017, the government of Makati immediately suspended its anti-dengue vaccination drive following its statement. In its statement, pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur reported concerns that Filipinos, mostly schoolchildren, could potentially be at risk of a more severe disease, where the recipient of the vaccine had not had a previous dengue infection; however, a medical director of Sanofi said that the dengue vaccination would not cause \\"severe dengue\\". On December 4, 2017, Sanofi also denied that they made Filipinos into “guinea pigs”, explaining that the vaccine program was conducted by the DOH and not them. Senator JV Ejercito, chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, sought to identify by January 2018 whether there was an irregularity in the procurement of the vaccine, while Senator Risa Hontiveros urged the government to address the health threats posed by the vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines ordered Sanofi to stop distributing of Dengvaxia into the country.\\"FDA Advisory No. 2017-318  Suspension of Sale/Marketing/Distribution of Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.’s Tetravalent Vaccine (Live, Attenuated)(Dengvaxia)\\". Archived from the original. Food and Drug Administration. Former Health Secretary Janette Garin said she welcomed the investigation which will be conducted by the Philippine Department of Justice. Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque told the media that 10 percent of the 733,000 to 830,000 schoolchildren were at risk of dengue infection. Since then, the Philippine Department of Education has closely monitored the students who have been injected by the vaccine. Hontiveros said that Sanofi should take liability for the medical expenses of those who contracted severe dengue fever after receiving doses of the vaccine. Sanofi representative Thomas Triomphe \\"was forced to apologize\\" during the House of Representatives hearing on the Dengvaxia dengue vaccine. Former President Benigno Aquino III, who approved the vaccination program in 2016, expressed interest on attending the Senate hearing. On December 16, Aquino told reporters that \\"With the announcement of Sanofi and the reactions to it, there has been a lot of tension building up and I think it is incumbent upon me even as a citizen to try and allay certain fears, to put it in the proper perspective, to put it on the proper level\\". Secretary Duque reminded the public, especially parents, that \\"the vaccine is not a 'standalone' preventive measure against dengue.\\" On December 15, 2017, former Education and Skills Development chief Augusto Syjuco Jr filed \\"mass murder and plunder\\" complaints against Aquino and former health secretary Janette Garin over the controversial vaccination program. Former health secretary Enrique Ona blamed his successor Janette Garin, who advised former president Benigno Aquino lll to purchase the Dengvaxia. On February 2, 2018, the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) issued a report stating that three out of 14 children who died after receiving Dengvaxia had an indication of dengue despite immunization. On February 3, a group of doctors, including former health secretary Esperanza Cabral, urged the Public Attorney's Office (PAO) to stop conducting autopsies. On February 5, 2018 during a probe at the House of Representatives, mothers of children who took part in a mass vaccination program confronted Garin, screaming at her and accusing her of killing their children. The women would later admit to media that none of their children died after vaccination. On February 21, 2018 Senator Richard Gordon said that the DOH must be liable for the controversy. On March 13, Senator Gordon formally terminated the investigation of the controversy. On February 26, 2018 Aquino appeared for the first time at House inquiry about the controversy; he said that the controversy has been \\"politicized\\", but the Malacañang Palace distanced itself from Aquino's allegations. On February 27, 2018 the opposition Representatives such as Gary Alejano of Magdalo and Edcel Lagman of Albay urged President Rodrigo Duterte to intervene about the dispute between the PAO and DOH.\\"Bandila: Ilang mambabatas, hinamon si Duterte ukol sa Dengvaxia\\". On March 3, about 200 families of Dengvaxia vacinees joined the advocacy run held in Quezon Memorial Circle. In 2018 Dengvaxia was approved in Europe and USA in 2019. Dengvaxia is approved for sale in 19 countries including the European Union and the USA and has saved an estimated 1 million lives. = Charges = On April 5, Public Attorney's Office filed the criminal charges (reckless imprudence resulting in homicide under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code and violation of Republic Act No. 9745 (Anti-Torture Act) and torture) against the Former Health Secretary Janette Garin and other former officials. However, Garin said that the charges have no basis and vowed to file a counter-charge against PAO. The families of four children — Aejay Bautista (11), Lenard Baldonado (10), Zandro Colite (11), and Angelica Pestilos (10), whose deaths had been linked to Dengvaxia — also filed the charges. On April 19, PAO filed criminal complaints before the Department of Justice (DOJ), including the incumbent Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, following the death of the 13-year-old girl after receiving Dengvaxia on November 17, 2017. Duque fires back by describing the charges against him as \\"malicious and oppressive\\" and he also said that he has nothing to do with the implementation of the dengue immunization program since he was seated as the secretary last October 2017. = Gordon's draft report = On April 15, 2018 Gordon said he expected at least 10 senators to sign his report holding former President Benigno Aquino III and other officials liable. Senator Panfilo Lacson will not sign the report due to \\"unreasonable comments\\" about him. On April 17, Aside from Gordon, who already signed the report, Senators Ralph Recto, Manny Pacquiao, Win Gatchalian, Tito Sotto, Gregorio Honasan, Juan Miguel Zubiri, JV Ejercito, Nancy Binay, and Grace Poe have signed. On April 20, Senator Sonny Angara also signed.  Casualties and consequences  No one reportedly died from the vaccine. Many of the victims' parents nonetheless blamed the dengue vaccine for the deaths of their children.\\"Anak namin namatay sa Dengvaxia\\" (in Tagalog). Archived from the original.

According to the DOH, 729,105 grade 4 students from selected regions have received the first dose of the vaccine. Of these, 534,303 students had approved parental consent but only 491,990 students received the first dose of the vaccine. Note: Pause at 2:48.

It was alleged that Acosta has two \\"loyal\\" certified public accountants named Lira Hosea Suangco and Maveric Sales who are tasked to maintain office supplies such as bond paper to be used for the Dengvaxia cases. The funds however were used for other purposes. It was also alleged that Acosta and Erfe are using PAO funds to purchase tarpaulins, t-shirts and coffins to be used in rallies.https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/08/15/19/acosta- accused-of-using-dengvaxia-issue-for-corruption-in-pao See also *2019 Philippines measles outbreak – attributed to the aftermath of the controversy References Vaccine controversies 2017 in the Philippines 2018 in the Philippines 2017 controversies 2018 controversies Health disasters in the Philippines 2018 health disasters 2019 measles outbreaks ","title":"Dengvaxia controversy"},{"id":"55963259","text":"Pardosa elegans is a species of wolf spiders (family Lycosidae) found in Russia.Verzeichniss südrussischer Spinnen.

Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium.Kassam, Nisan. Indonesia: The Islamic Defenders Front. Human Rights Without Frontiers. is an Indonesian Islamist political organization formed in 1998. It was founded by Muhammad Rizieq Shihab with backing from Indonesian military, police generals and political elites. The organization's leader is Ahmad Shabri Lubis, who was inaugurated in 2015,Ini Ketua Umu FPI Yang Baru Ust. Ahmad. Muslimedia News. Retrieved December 1, 2017. and Rizieq Shihab remains acting as the adviser with the title Great Imam of the FPI for life. The FPI originally started as a civil group that positioned itself as an Islamic moral police force against vice, whose activity was not authorized by the government. Later, it transformed itself into an Islamist pressure group with active online campaigns. The organization has organized a number of religious and political mass protests; the most prominent example being the November 2016 Jakarta protests and several other rallies against the incumbent Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama in the subsequent months. Another prominent protest orchestrated by the FPI was a rally at the American Embassy condemning the Iraq War, dating back to late 2003. The protests were criticized as conducting hate crimes in the name of Islam and religious-related violence. History FPI emerged on 17 August 1998 as an outcome of the meeting by religious leaders to commemorate the 53rd anniversary of Indonesian independence. The gathering took place at the pesantren (Islamic boarding school) of al-Umm in Ciputat, South Tangerang.Jahroni, 2004: 213 It was hosted by Misbahul Anam, an activist of the Indonesian Islam Boyscouts (PII),Jahroni, 2004: 243 and attended by religious leaders affiliated with haba'ib (scholars from the descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), notably Muhammad Rizieq Shihab. The meeting discussed urgent issues faced by the Muslim community, namely the proliferation of maksiat (immorality), killings of Muslims in places such as Tanjung Priok and Aceh, and the lack of Muslim organizations that can impose the Islamic doctrine of amr ma'ruf nahy munkar (enjoining good and forbidding wrong).Jahroni, 2004: 215 The first major FPI campaign that garnered media attention was an incident in Ketapang, Central Jakarta in November 1998. The incident was triggered by the killing of a local Betawi Muslim teenager by Ambonese Christian, and rapidly escalated into a Muslim-Christian riot which claimed dozens of lives.Jahroni, 2004: 220Sihbudi & Nursalim, 2001Hutagalung, 2016: 456 The Betawi community called the support of FPI, which made an effort to prevent further escalation. The organization aims to implement sharia law in Indonesia. Later, it transformed itself into an Islamist pressure group which furthers its political motives by promoting what is considered as religious or racial propaganda through the Internet and occasional anti- government campaigns. However, in January 2017, several FPI official Twitter accounts were suspended due to violations of Twitter rules, including spamming, incivility and making threats. =Government support= Muhammad Rizieq Shihab (right) with then-police chief Tito Karnavian (middle) during the December 2016 Jakarta protest which was led by FPI. The emergence of FPI attracted strong interest among the high-rank members of the Indonesian military. The Indonesian military, previously suppressed political Islam, had been approaching toward conservative Islamic groups since Feisal Tanjung was inaugurated as the commander in 1993, to counter criticism from the left-wing segments of the society such as NGO and intellectuals.Jahroni, 2004: 213-5 The military provided monetary aid as well as military training to the paramilitary wing of FPI known as Laskar Pembela Islam (Islamic Defenders Paramilitary, LPI). In turn, FPI occasionally made a mobilization in support of the former commander Wiranto and several army generals.Facal, 2019: 8 FPI also received patronage from the chief of Jakarta police Nugroho Djayusman.Facal, 2019: 9 B.J. Habibie, who succeeds presidency after Suharto, also provided funding toward several Islamic groups including FPI in anticipation of his election.Facal, 2019: 7 Even after the democratic transition, a number of military generals retained support toward FPI, as they needed grassroots support to maintain the turbulent social order. FPI lost major support from the state apparatus after the inauguration of Sofyan Yacob as the chief of Jakarta police, who criticized FPI's vigilantism. FPI's headquarters in Petamburan, Tanah Abang was raided by police in 2002 and 13 members were arrested following FPI's attack on nightclubs and billiard halls.Jahroni, 2004: 216-7 Rizieq was also arrested in 2003 and jailed for seven months.Jahroni, 2004: 218 Misbahul Anam, the former secretary-general of FPI, considered the relations with the state apparatus to be opportunistic. However, Sutanto, the chief of the national police (2005-2008) and state intelligent agency (2009-2011), maintained the importance of utilizing FPI in certain cases. Even after 2002, FPI acted in cooperation with military and police on several occasions, including in 2010 and 2011 to shut down public debates held by LGBT and Ahmadiyya activists.Ricklefs, 2012: 421 FPI also found political support among the politicians who belong to the Islamist and right-wing nationalist political parties. Hamzah Haz of the United Development Party and the 9th vice president of Indonesia (2001-2004) occasionally visited FPI meetings during his terms. FPI provided grassroots support for Wiranto during the 2004 and 2009 presidential election, as well as former army general Prabowo Subianto during the 2014 and 2019 presidential election. Protests and actions =Actions against religious pluralism= The FPI has been vocal against liberalism and multiculturalism, and to the extension of the Pancasila doctrine which upholds religious pluralism. On 1 June 2008, the FPI staged an attack against members of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), who were holding a rally coinciding with the commemoration day of Pancasila near the National Monument in the city center. The attack was claimed as a response to the perceived threat by the AKKBB against the FPI. The incident was referred to by the media as the Monas Incident. It caused media outrage and led to the arrest of Rizieq Shihab among 56 other FPI members. Rizieq was later imprisoned for one year and six months, after being convicted over attacks against the AKKBB. In January 2017, the police declared FPI leader Rizieq Shihab a suspect for alleged defamation of Pancasila . The FPI also often holds protests against what it sees as the Christianization of Indonesia. Notable targets include GKI Yasmin Bogor, and HKBP Church Bekasi, where the group used violence to force the closure of the churches. The FPI also endorsed the Singkil administration for closing around 20 churches in Singkil, Aceh. This stirred up controversy over the use of the local administrative law in accordance with Sharia, running counter to the Indonesian constitution, which guarantees freedom of religious practice. In early 2017, the FPI and related Islamist groups staged a mass protest against the construction of a new Christian church in Bekasi, West Java. The protest developed into a riot and scuffles with the police, resulting in property damage and five police officers being injured.http://m.liputan6.com/news/read/2898273/demo-tolak-pembangunan-gereja- di-bekasi-ricuh-5-polisi-terluka =Actions against Ahmadiyyah= One of Rizieq Shihab's propaganda campaigns openly called for hostility against Ahmadis: > \\"We call on the Muslim community. Let us go to war with Ahmadiyyah! Kill > Ahmadiyyah wherever they are!........ And, if they talk about human rights? > Human rights are satanic! Human rights are crap!.....If they want to know > who is responsible for killing Ahmadiyyah, it is I; it is FPI and others > from the Muslim community who are responsible for killing Ahmadiyyah! Say > that Sobri Lubis ordered it, that Habib Rizieq and FPI ordered it! \\" The FPI was suspected of acting behind the scenes in the 6 February 2011 assault against the Ahmadiyyah community, in which three people were killed. The assault was led by a group of over thousand people, wielding rocks, machetes, swords, and spears. They attacked the house of an Ahmadi leader in Cikeusik, Banten. Similarly, a group attacked the Ahmadiyyah headquarters near Bogor and harassed its members in areas such as in East Lombok, Manislor, Tasikmalaya, Parung, and Garut. =Actions against the perceived communist threat= The FPI often employs anti-communism as its political motivation. In June 2010, along with other organizations, the FPI attacked a meeting about free healthcare in East Java, mistaking it for a meeting of the banned Communist Party of Indonesia. In January 2017, the FPI called for the withdrawal of Rupiah banknotes, accused them of displaying the image of the banned hammer and sickle logo. The FPI's allegations, however, were rejected by Bank Indonesia (BI), referring to it as a recto-verso security feature of the BI logo for the new Rupiah banknotes. FPI was accused of stirring public unrest by slandering Bank Indonesia and the government. =Anti-government campaigns and relations with right-wing parties= The FPI has been vocal in campaigns against incumbent governments, starting during the second term of President Yudhoyono (2009-2014). This campaign was said to be more intense during the Joko Widodo era after the Basuki Tjahaja Purnama's alleged blasphemy case in 2016. Because of this, the FPI is widely seen as an opposition movement, and is reportedly known to have close relations with various right-wing parties; most of which are currently opposition parties =Actions against perceived defamation of Islamic sensitivity= The FPI is sensitive toward the perceived defamation and violation of Islamic norms in various aspects of society. In its early days, FPI targeted shops in Garut and Makassar that sold alcohol during the month of Ramadhan, some of which were reportedly ransacked. Various nightclubs, bars, and cafes were targeted by the FPI for perceived non-conformity with Islamic norms. In 2006, the FPI and other Islamic organizations including the Indonesian Mujahedeen Council protested against the publication of Playboy Indonesia. The protest led to the eviction of the Playboy office from Jakarta to Bali. In 2013, the FPI accused LGBT activists, such as Lady Gaga and Irshad Manji, of being \\"devils\\", and threatened their safety. This erupted in controversy in 2013 during Lady Gaga's Born This Way tour, which resulted in the eventual cancellation of concerts in Indonesia. The action was criticized for being a violation of Indonesian law sanctioning violent threats, as prescribed in Article 336 of the Criminal Code. In 2015, the FPI attacked the Regent of Purwakarta, Dedi Mulyadi, accusing him of being a musyrik (polytheist) after he put up statues of Sundanese puppet characters in a number of city parks throughout Purwakarta in West Java. the FPI accused Dedi of debasing Islamic tenets by violating the aniconist principle of Islam, as well as using the Sundanese greeting Sampurasun, instead of the Muslim-approved Assalamualaikum. In December 2015, around a hundred FPI members conducted a 'sweeping' operation against the regent. Its members inspected cars passing through the front gate of Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) in Central Jakarta where the Indonesia Theater Federation Awards ceremony was being held, attempting to stop Dedi from attending the event. =Opposition and uprising against Basuki Tjahaja Purnama= The FPI was known for its efforts to topple the administration of former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, popularly known as Ahok. The FPI criticized Basuki's background as a Christian and Chinese Indonesian, both being minorities, citing that the position of the governor of Jakarta should be reserved only for Muslims. In 2014, the FPI held a demonstration in front of the Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council building in Jakarta. The organization refused to accept Basuki as Jakarta's governor after former governor Joko Widodo was elected President the same year. In late 2016, during the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election season, the FPI led the national outcry against Basuki for his alleged blasphemy against the Qur'an. As a response to the perceived blasphemy, the FPI organized seven protests titled 'Aksi Bela Islam', ('Action to Defend Islam') in order to create pressure against Basuki and to demand his imprisonment. The protests culminated in the November 2016 Jakarta protests, December 2016 Jakarta protests and February 2017 Jakarta protests. These were held once a month until Basuki's final conviction in May 2017, when he was sentenced to two years imprisonment after losing the election to Anies Baswedan. Reception =General public= There have been calls by Indonesians, mainly mainstream Muslims, other religious organizations, political communities and ethnic groups, for the FPI to be disbanded or banned. Ansor Youth Movement, the youth branch of Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Muslim organization in Indonesia, demanded the government to shut down FPI in 2008, but the government never agreed to such calls. Various critics and media outlets have described the FPI as inciting extremism, racism and bigotry, particularly noting its occasional hate crimes, discrimination against minorities and religious intolerance. An International Crisis Group report called it \\"an urban thug organization\\", emphasizing its violent vigilantism. The group has also been criticized for the use of violence; the police have recorded that the FPI engaged in 29 cases of violence and destructive behavior in 2010 and 5 cases in 2011 in West Java, Banten, Central Java, North Sumatra and South Sumatra. = Rejection in Kalimantan = On February 11, 2012, hundreds of protesters from the local community in Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan; mainly from the Dayak tribe; staged a protest at Tjilik Riwut Airport to block the arrival of four senior leaders of the group, who wanted to inaugurate the provincial branch of the organization. Due to security concerns, the management of the airport ordered the FPI members to remain on board the aircraft while other passengers disembarked. The FPI members were then flown to Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan. The deputy chairman of the Central Kalimantan Dayak Tribe Council (DAD) later said that the organization had asked the Central Kalimantan Police to ban the group's provincial chapter as the FPI's presence would create tension, particularly as Central Kalimantan is known as a place conducive to religious harmony. A formal letter from the Central Kalimantan administration stated that they firmly rejected the FPI and would not let them establish a chapter in the province because it \\"contradicts the local wisdom of the Dayak tribe that upholds peace\\". The letter was sent to the Minister of Coordination of Political, Legal and Security Affairs with copies being sent to the president of Indonesia, the People's Consultative Assembly speaker, the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court, the Home Minister and the National Police Chief. The FPI is now banned all over the Kalimantan for its disruptive and divisive actions against local communities.  Organization  FPI broadly consists of two parts, the Consultative Assembly which aims to provide decision-making, and the Executive Board which carries out the decision provided by the Consultative Assembly. FPI's paramilitary division known as Laskar Pembela Islam (LPI), which conducts all the vigilantism, is attached to the Department of Jihad and State Defense of the Executive Board. LPI is structured in a very similar manner with an actual military; led by Imam Besar (Great Leader), there are multiple ranks based on the number of military personnel commanded by them, from Imam (25,000 personnel), Wali (5,000 personnel), Qaid (1,000 personnel), Amir (200 personnel), to Rais (20 personnel). Each one of the LPI personnel is referred to as Jundi.Jahroni, 2004: 237-241 FPI is an organization open for the public, and anybody can be a member. This allowed FPI to expand quickly since its foundation in 1998, and it can rapidly mobilize personnel during the demonstrations. FPI has its branch on a provincial level with similar organizational structures consist of advisory and executive boards. Although the networks penetrate into district and sub-district levels, they are loosely coordinated, and often there are cases of fragmentation such as FPI Surakarta branch which claims to be independent of the headquarters in Jakarta. =Organizational structure= *Majelis Tanfidzi (Executive Board) Chief Leader: Ahmad Shabri Lubis *Department of Foreign Affairs *Department of Home Affairs *Department of Religious Affairs *Department of Jihad and State Defense Laskar Pembela Islam (Islamic Defenders Paramilitary, LPI) *Department of Social, Political, and Legal Affairs *Department of Education and Culture *Department of Economy and Industry *Department of Research and Technology *Department of Logistics *Department of Social Welfare *Department of Information *Department of Women's Affairs Secretary-General: Munarman *Commission of Front Experts *Commission of Front Recruitment *Commission of Front Investigation *Commission of Front Legal Assistance *Anti-Maksiat Commission *Anti-Violence Commission *Majelis Syuro (Consultative Assembly) Chief Leader: Muhsin bin Ahmad Al-Attas *Commission of Sharia *Commission of Honor *Commission of Coordination *Commission of Consultancy *Commission of Supervision Footnotes References *Facal, G.

History The work consists of a chorale and eleven short variations written on it. This is one of Bach's earlier works, dating from around 1705, when the young composer was influenced by the style of the variations of Georg Böhm, organist of St. John's Church in Lüneburg, where Bach was a student. Dieterich Buxtehude is another probable source of inspiration. Of Bach's chorale partitas for organ, this is the longest. Bach composed the initial chorale by taking the old traditional melody of \\"Sei gegrüßet, Jesu gütig\\", then presented a series of variations according to different styles. Five of the eleven variations require an organ with pedals. The melody of the original hymn is usually present in the soprano part. Each variation is developed based on a rhythmic motif or theme.

It is widely accepted as referring to a specific group of unbelieving Jews who opposed Jesus. The verse has often been used to justify hatred against all Jews or particular subsets of modern Jews, which academic scholars generally view as ignorant of the Biblical context and the fact that Jesus and the suspected author of Revelation were Jews. Biblical account In Revelation 2, verse 8 \\"And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write;...\\" verse 9 \\"I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.\\" Revelation 3, verse 7 \\"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write;...\\" verse 9 \\"Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.\\" Other uses Similar language is found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, where a small persecuted Jewish sect considered the rest of Judaism apostate, and called its persecutors \\"the lot of Belial\\" (Satan).

The Rev. Billy Graham used the phrase \\"synagogue of Satan\\" in a private 1973 White House conversation with President Richard M. Nixon.

The painting comes from the home of Giovanni Antonio Sauli who commissioned the work along with Danaë and Penitent Magdalen.Christiansen, Keith, and Judith W. Mann. Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2002. 166. It has been owned by the Getty Museum in Los Angeles since 1998.  History  Orazio Gentileschi originally was a Mannerist painter, however after the turn of the 17th century, Gentileschi was deeply influenced by Caravaggio. As with Caravaggio, Gentileschi employed deep use of tenebrism, painted from models and did studies from real life, but according to the authors, Gentileschi was more faithful to the representation of the model. While Caravaggio's art allowed interpretation from the viewer, Gentileschi heightened the \\"transformation of the everyday into the extraordinary and dramatic.\\" In 1621, Gentileschi moved to Genoa as per the invitation of Giovanni Antonio Sauli who knew Gentileschi as he had paintings done by Gentileschi's brother. After the promise of employment, Gentileschi made the move from Rome to Genoa, and it was during this time that Sauli commissioned Gentileschi to paint not only Lot and His Daughters, but two other works Penitent Magdalene and Danäe and the Shower of Gold, to create a series of three. All three paintings coexisted in the same room in the palace of Domenico Sauli according to a statement by Carlo Giuseppe Ratti, and have a poetic sensual nature about them. Gentileschi followed the trend of painters of the time and created multiple versions of each painting. Traced back to a Genoese collection and with the aid of X rays, the painting of Lot and His Daughters acquired by the Getty Museum has been established as the prime version of Gentilschi's composition. There is a theme that ties the triad of works Danaë, Penitent Magdalen, and Lot and His Daughters, The combination is odd as each painting deals with different cycles of history and individual themes. These themes are from the Old Testament, the New Testament, and one is of classical Pagan mythology. The authors also give the argument that each of the works could be erotic (Danaë), moral (Lot and His Daughters), and distinctly devotional (Danaë) . While all three have to do with themes that involve women, two of the paintings incorporate the reclining long figure – Penitent Magdalene and Danaë. In contrast, Lot and His Daughters occupy a multi figure narrative. The two reclining figures contrast each other quite dramatically while Lot seems to be a middle ground between the two extremes. This could be an attempt to attest to the extensive range of work that Gentileschi was capable of, and most certainly helped his popularity after the completion of the three works. Unfortunately, only two of the three works – Danaë and the Shower of Gold and Lot and His Daughters – remain together. The Penitent Magdalene was sold to a private collection. Both Danaë and Lot are next to each other in the Getty.  Description  Lot and His Daughters is an oil on canvas landscape painting that measures 59.75 x 74.5 inches. The painting contains three figures, Lot and his daughters, centrally placed and surrounded by a landscape setting. All three are clothed in contemporary garb that would have been worn in 17th century daily life, certainly not garb seen in the Bronze Age in the city of Sodom pre-1200 BCE. Lot is in the center and his two daughters flank each side of him. He is seen in a hunching position resting his head in the lap of his daughter to the left, while the daughter to the right leans back on him for support. As he is laying down it is uncertain whether Lot is sleeping, frightened by the terror going on in Sodom, or simply drunk. His facial expression is not completely visible to the viewer, however, his eyes are closed and his brows are furrowed citing some form of discomfort that he is having, whether it is a result of his intoxication or his reaction to the sounds of Sodom. His right arm languidly falls over the leg of his daughter that he is laying on and is devoid of tension. He is also in a half fetal position and his body seems relaxed in comparison to the tense nature of his two daughters. There is a mixture of realism and placement in the fabric Lot is wearing. On his upper body, the fabric contours to his body and the folds and creases are believable. As the eye scans to his legs, Gentileschi creates an odd placement of the garment on Lot's thigh. The garment has folds and sits bunched up in a way that is not indicative of someone who is laying down. It is almost as if Gentileschi painted it like that solely to highlight his ability to draw complex drapery. The daughter to the viewer's left seems to protect and shield Lot, while interacting with the scene cut off from the painting. She cradles her father's upper body and shields him both with her right hand that invites his head into her lap, and projects her body forward, leaning over her father and towards her sister. She seems to eagerly point off into the distance, engaging her sister to look at the destruction that is occurring in Sodom out of sight of the viewer; however, while her body is filled with dynamic motion, her hand lazily points giving a faint reminder of the way Adam's finger is outstretched in the Creation of Adam by Michelangelo (Fig. 3). Not only is there lack of tension in her finger, but the daughter has a seemingly apathetic response on her face. She looks neither shocked nor sad but as if she is just saying \\"hey look\\" to her sister. This could possibly be attributed to the fact that in the biblical story, Lot and his daughters believed they were going to be the sole survivors of the destruction. Gentileschi takes more care instilling fear and astonishment in her body and ending with apathy in her hand and facial expression. By doing this, Gentileschi cements the reminder that Lot and his daughters know they will be okay in the end. Along with her body, her outfit is dynamic in movement as with the sister to the right. Gentileschi amplifies the creases and folds in her dress and creates a physical body underneath the mass of material showing his mastery of creating realistic body depictions underneath clothing. For example, while the daughter's right foot is not visible to the viewer, is it understandable from the draping of the garment that her right leg is crossed and tucked beneath her left leg and her father's head. The daughter to the viewer's right reclines in fear away from what the daughter on the left is pointing at as she leans on her father's body for support. Her face, somewhat in profile, is unseen from the viewer as Gentileschi places her back towards us. This allows the viewer to focus on the position of her body and clothing. Her body motion indicates that she is turning towards her family, and it appears as if she is in the process of backing up, while her right leg is bent high towards her chest providing protection and as if it is the leg providing her with the scooting motion away from the unseen image. This daughter is markedly less clothed than Lot and the daughter to the left as her garment falls off her shoulders. Gentileschi takes care to note the folds and creases of the fabric with treatments of shading that indicate the billowy nature of the garment. The viewer could presume that the garment was in the process of falling off while Lot and his daughters race up the landscape in search of a haven. Considering her position in the piece, this daughter would have been the closest to the destruction that unfolded in Sodom, and could have caused her to be in a hurried state leading to her disheveled appearance. The daughter also has a foreshortened appearance in comparison to her sister and father and looks as though if she stretched herself out, she would be shorter than the other two.  Multiple versions  While the J. Paul Getty Museum houses one of the most important pieces of Gentileschi's career, there are at least seven painted versions and one engraving of this piece.Leonard, Mark, Narayan Khandekar, and Dawson W. Carr. \\"'Amber Varnish' and Orazio Gentileschi's 'Lot and His Daughters'.\\" The Burlington Magazine 143, no. 1174 (2001): 4-10. https://www.jstor.org/stable/889066. 4 The version that is held in the Getty has been confused with another version that looks nearly identical, as well as a version that is located in the Berlin State Museum (Figure 4). The version held in the Berlin Museum is especially intriguing due to the fact that the composition is nearly the same, however an important note is that the colors of the garments of the two daughters are switched between the version in the Getty and the version in the Berlin Museum. The Lot and His Daughters that currently stands in the Berlin Museum bears exactly the same figural composition as the one in the Getty. Lot is hunched in the lap of the daughter to the left as she points to Sodom and the daughter to the right backs away from the view in the same position. However, the daughter to the left is wearing a yellow dress and the daughter to the right is wearing a red dress which actively changes the mood of the painting.  Symbolism  Gentileschi's simple composition is filled with subtle, but poignant forms of symbolism that comprise both the individual piece, as well as bringing together the other two pieces in the set. The use of primary colors is a striking feature in the composition itself. Gentileschi uses the primary colors red yellow and blue and gives each figure in the composition their own color. Lot receives blue, the daughter to the left receives red and the daughter to the right receives yellow. The color attribute seems to be unimportant, however, these colors are the only colors that cannot be created through the mixing of other colors. They are the basis for every color that can occur on the color wheel, and it makes sense that Gentileschi would give each figure these colors because, in the history of Lot and his daughters, they are the only individuals that survive the world as they know it and must repopulate. Gentileschi is able to use color as a symbol for origin, making sure the viewer knows that Lot and his daughters are the progenitors of \\"their world\\". Nudity also has a symbolic role in the piece, and there is a noticeable descending order in which the amount of clothing decreases in the figures from left to right. The daughter to the left is the most clothed, then Lot bears more skin, and then the daughter to the right has her garment nearly exposing her. After Lot's daughters realize there are no more men on earth to reproduce with they hatch a plan to get their father drunk for two consecutive days, and after he is drunk, they lay with him to get pregnant. Gentileschi foreshadows the incestuous relationship that Lot and his daughters will partake in by creating a combination of multiple scenes of the story. The combination of scenes in the painting consist of the daughters looking on in the distance, and their decision to have intercourse with their father, evidenced by Lot's drunkenness and the daughter to the right already in the process of disrobing. The inclusion of a physical symbol in the piece shows Gentileschi's flair in combining both literal and figurative symbols in the painting. The literal symbols in Gentileschi's piece are limited to the jug and cup in the lower left-hand corner of the painting. The jug is open, overturned, and empty next to a cup that is also empty making a reference to the plot that the daughters hatched to get Lot drunk. It also refers to the loss of both daughters' purity. When they set their plan in motion, this is the beginnings of the process of becoming impure as they will soon lose their virginity. The literal symbols in reference to the story are coincidentally the ones that Gentileschi \\"hid\\" the most as they are tucked away in the corner. Meanwhile, the subtlest ones – such as the choice of color and foreshadowing – are the ones that draw attention unbeknownst to the viewer. It is possible that Gentileschi intentionally did this to create a poetic composition. = Color Theory = Red is considered an \\"active\\" color. Red usually symbolizes passion, energy, and danger. Yellow symbolizes freshness, and optimism, but yellow also represents cowardice and caution. It is interesting that in the Berlin version, the daughter who is pointing is wearing a yellow garment, she is actively engaging towards the danger, leaning her body in closer to the destruction even though she is further away – almost lacking fear of what's happening as she urges her sister to look. The daughter to the right wearing red is backing away from everything. It is highly possible that this version with this color selection was not favored by either Sauli or Gentileschi. The Getty version where the daughter passionately pointing out engaging towards the destruction is wearing red seems much more fitting and balances the composition much better. It would also make sense that the daughter to the right wears yellow as she is exacting extreme caution by trying to remove herself as far away from the destruction and she moves backwards, and also represents her feelings of terror, which is also represented in the color yellow. Assumedly, Lot most likely stayed blue as he brings balance and stability to the piece between the push and pull composition of the daughters. He and his garment color also represents calmness as he is oblivious to his surroundings. The version in the Berlin Museum also contains a higher use of contrast which is evident in the way the light creates a deep shadow on the garment of the daughter to the left of Lot. The backside of her is almost completely in shadow where her face barely makes it into the light where Lot and the other daughter are illuminated. The vase and the chalice that sit beside the daughter to the left are also highly illuminated and backed by their intense shadow in the corner whereas in the Getty version, they do not pose as much importance because Gentileschi chooses not to create such high contrast.

Martin Company for the United States Navy. Originally intended as an air-to-surface weapon, it materialized as a propulsion test vehicle, and between 1947 and 1950 was used for test purposes and, as the KDM Plover, as a target drone. Design and development Development of the Gorgon IV began in May 1945, when the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics contracted with the Glenn L. Martin Company, as part of Project Gorgon, to develop an air-to-surface missile, powered by a ramjet engine and using active radar homing for guidance. The end of World War II saw a reduction in need for such a weapon, however the contract was continued in 1946 as a propulsion test vehicle, originally designated KUM-1, then PTV-2 before finally being redesignated PTV-N-2.Parsch 2005 The PTV-N-2 was of fairly conventional design, with mildly-swept wings and a conventional empennage; roll control was through spoilerons. The Marquardt XRJ30 ramjet engine was mounted below the aft fuselage, and the vehicle was fitted with drag brakes to prevent exceeding the engine's design limits. Flight control was through a combination of a preset course via autopilot and radio command guidance;Ordway and Wakeford 1960, p.182 the vehicle was equipped with radio telemetry to transmit data. Following the end of each test flight, the vehicle would deploy a parachute for recovery in the ocean; the vehicles were said to be in such good condition that it would be possible to re-fly them after cleaning them of salt water residue. Operational history Nineteen PTV-N-2s were produced, with flight tests beginning in July 1947; in November, the program having adopted Northrop F2T night-fighters as launch aircraft,Kolln 2009, p.115. the Gorgon IV first achieved high-speed flight, reaching approximately Mach 0.85; it was the first ramjet-powered winged aircraft to successfully fly in the United States, and it was claimed that the missile's speed was deliberately restricted to keep it below the speed of sound. A flight time of 11 minutes 15 seconds, a record at the time for ramjets, was achieved on the second flight test. The test program continued through December 1949, originally at the Naval Air Missile Test Center test range at Point Mugu, California; testing was later moved to the Naval Aviation Ordnance Test Station in Chincoteague, Virginia in order to be closer to Martin's factory.Flight International, Volume 55, p. 139 (1949) The Navy began a refit of to test the feasibility of launching Gorgon IVs from an at-sea platform, however the project was cancelled before completion. Despite this the program was considered to be \\"very successful\\" by the Navy. Following the end of the program, the remaining PTV-N-2s were assigned as target drones, given the designation KDM-1 Plover. The Gorgon IV airframe was also used as the basis of the ASM-N-5 Gorgon V chemical weapons dispenser. Surviving aircraft KDM-1 drone at the Udvar-Hazy Center A recovered Gorgon IV was donated by the U.S. Navy to the National Air and Space Museum in 1966; it is on display at the Steven F.

It is named after Brian Alspach, who posed it as a research problem in 1981. A proof was published by . Formulation In this context, a disjoint cycle cover is a set of simple cycles, no two of which use the same edge, that include all of the edges of a graph. For a disjoint cycle cover to exist, it is necessary for every vertex to have even degree, because the degree of each vertex is two times the number of cycles that include that vertex, an even number. And for the cycles in a disjoint cycle cover to have a given collection of lengths, it is also necessary for the sum of the given cycle lengths to equal the total number of edges in the given graph. Alspach conjectured that, for complete graphs, these two necessary conditions are also sufficient: if n is odd (so that the degrees are even) and a given list of cycle lengths (all at most n) adds to tbinom{n}{2} (the number of edges in the complete graph) then the complete graph K_n can always be decomposed into cycles of the given length. It is this statement that Bryant, Horsley, and Pettersson proved. Generalization to even numbers of vertices For complete graphs K_n whose number n of vertices is even, Alspach conjectured that it is always possible to decompose the graph into a perfect matching and a collection of cycles of prescribed lengths summing to tbinom{n}{2}-n/2. In this case the matching eliminates the odd degree at each vertex, leaving a subgraph of even degree, and the remaining condition is again that the sum of the cycle lengths equals the number of edges to be covered. This variant of the conjecture was also proven by Bryant, Horsley, and Pettersson. Related problems The Oberwolfach problem on decompositions of complete graphs into copies of a given 2-regular graph is related, but neither is a special case of the other. If G is a 2-regular graph, with n vertices, formed from a disjoint union of cycles of certain lengths, then a solution to the Oberwolfach problem for G would also provide a decomposition of the complete graph into (n-1)/2 copies of each of the cycles of G. However, not every decomposition of K_n into this many cycles of each size can be grouped into disjoint cycles that form copies of G, and on the other hand not every instance of Alspach's conjecture involves sets of cycles that have (n-1)/2 copies of each cycle.

Powell Jr (born October 31, 1955) is an American bass-baritone opera singer and a former member of the U.S. Army Chorus. He is known for his performances at presidential events and for performing the role of Porgy in the George Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess. Before his retirement from the military in 2017, Powell was the oldest enlisted soldier in the Army. In 2015, Powell received the National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama. Early life Powell was born in Birdsnest, Virginia. He grew up in Cheriton, Virginia; he had four older sisters, and he said that they were instrumental in getting him interested in music. He grew up singing gospel music at the African Baptist Church. He said that from an early age he was encouraged by church members who recognized his vocal abilities. Powell remembers that at age 14 he was inspired by a recording of William Warfield singing the part of Porgy in the George Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess. \\"I had never seen anyone black in something so classical. I knew it was right for me. I said I was going to sing it some day,\\" he said later. He attended Northampton High School, graduating in 1974. He went on a musical tour of Europe the following year after hearing about it from his high school chorus teacher. Later, Powell worked as a prison guard, as a baggage handler for an airline, and as a disc jockey. He studied at Virginia State University and Indiana University before enrolling at the University of Maryland, where he was mentored by George Shirley, who had been the first black tenor with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Powell also sang at a dinner theater in Washington, D.C., where he received encouragement from other singers that led to his auditioning for the U.S. Army Chorus. Musical career In 1983, Powell joined the U.S. Army Chorus after his graduation from the University of Maryland, where he earned a voice degree. Four years later, he received approval to travel to Australia to perform the role of Porgy in productions of Porgy and Bess in Melbourne and Sydney. At that time, Powell was classified as a staff sergeant; he described himself as an ordinary soldier. \\"We are taught to march, do our drill and carry a rifle. What is different is that we are on call 24 hours a day to sing at VIP functions,\\" he said. He left the chorus in 1993 and spent several years singing around the world before rejoining the organization in 2001. Powell performed for several U.S. presidents and numerous dignitaries from other countries. Gerald Ford was particularly fond of Powell's performances of \\"Ol' Man River\\", and Powell sang solos at Ford's funeral and at the rededication of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library. He also performed the national anthem a cappella at the inauguration of George H. W. Bush in 1989. Powell had been selected for the task by First Lady Barbara Bush; he had performed at the couple's Christmas parties in years past. Powell became especially known for his work in opera, and he continued to make appearances in operas even after returning to the Army. He became well-known for singing the role of Porgy, reprising the role more than 2500 times. Powell appeared at Carnegie Hall in 2008, singing the part of Joe in Show Boat, and returned in 2009 as Porgy. He played King Balthazar in a BBC television production of Amahl and the Night Visitors. In 2015, Powell was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama. George Shirley was also awarded the medal that year. As of 2017, Powell was the Army's oldest enlisted soldier. That year he announced that he would retire on October 31, his 62nd birthday. A retirement celebration involving the U.S. Army Chorus, to be held in Cheriton, was planned for September 2017. Personal life Powell met his wife, Gina, through his work. She was also a singer and they met at an opera house. She died in 2015. Powell had a son in 1987.

This goddess is worshiped as Sri Chowdeshwari Devi or Sri Ramalinga Sowdeswari Amman in three forms: Shakti, Chamunda, and Jyothi (the divine light). Her other names are Banashankari and Soodambigai. She is Kuladevatha of Devanga people. History According to the Devanga Purana, Sage Devala,is the progenitor of the Devanga community. He emerged from the third eye of Lord Shiva (or, in some accounts, from Shiva's heart) to create clothing and to teach weaving to the world. When Devala returned after obtaining threads from Lord Vishnu's lotus navel, a group of five demons, Vajramushti, Dhoomravakra, Dhoomratchasa, Chithrasena and Panchasena, attacked him at midnight. In the dark, the power of the demons was overwhelming. Devala attempted to fight them off using Vishnu's Sudarshana Chakra, but failed, and finally prayed for Shakti to protect him. Shakti appeared in light and glory, wearing a bright full crown, holding a trident and other weapons in her hand while mounted on a lion. She killed the demons; their blood was white, black, red, green, and yellow. Devala soaked his threads in the demon's colorful blood. Shakti was then given the name Chowdeshwari or Sowdeswari (Chowda/Sowda/Sooda=the brightness). Sowdeswari advised Devala to worship her during every new moon (Amavasya). Devala went to the south Himalayas and founded Sagara Kingdom with Amodh Nagar as its capital. He wove new clothes and gave them to all: the gods (Trimurti and Tridevi), demigods (Deva, Asura), immortals (Gandarva, Kinnara) and humans. Devala gave clothes to cover Deva's body parts so his community is named as Devanga (Anga=Body part) Community. He married Suryadev's Sister DevaDhutta so as surya is first kinsmen , Then Aadhi shesha's daughter ChandraReka so Devanga people are called as Sedar/Jendar (Aadhi shesha is written as Aadhi Seda in tamil) and then he married Asura Vakrathantha's daughter AgniDhutta.People who follow Devala are known as Devanga or Devangar.  In Tamil Nadu  The ancient Devanga community who worshipped the goddess in Tamil Nadu dispersed to other states, including Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. They brought the weaving industry to their new home towns and set up temples of Sri Ramalinga Sowdeswari Amman as their deity. The Kannada- speaking Devanga community in Tamil Nadu is also known as Devanga Chettiar. They reside in a number of locations in the Coimbatore, Theni, Dindigul, Salem, Erode, Madurai and Virudhunagar districts. Although their religious practices fall into the Saivism and Vaishnavism denominations of Hinduism. they generally worship Sri Ramalinga Sowdeswari Amman. There are 10,000 Vamsa/Vansh clans in the Devanga community. Chowdeshwari vs Ramalinga Sowdeswari Devanga people originally followed Shaktism and worshipped the goddess in the form of Chowdeshwari.King Devadas built a temple and invited Lord Shiva as Ramalingeshwara and Parvathi as Sowdeswari from Srisailam temple, after that they adopted some Hindu traditions, worshipping Chowdeshwari along with RamaBana ( Lord Ram's Bow) and Lingam (Shiva), as Sri Ramalinga Sowdeswari Amman. In general the Devanga people worship Sri Ramalinga Sowdeswari Amman as well as Chowdeshwari Devi, and several other names. while the Nepali Korakpur Devanga people worship her as Komalangi Devi.

Pooja rituals in Sowdeswari Temple The pooja rituals for Sri Ramalinga Sowdeswari Amman are a mixture of the culture of North and South India. The celebrants build a small cart-like building using jaggery, roof it with sugarcane and use Betel leaf for decoration. A special turmeric called pandaram is offered as Prasāda for the deities. The Devanga people perform all their rituals by themselves.  Alagu seva  This ritual derives from the story that King Devadas, the seventh incarnation of Devala, built a beautiful temple for Sowdeshwari. He invited Lord Shiva and Parvathi from Srisailam to the temple but on the way Parvathi disappeared in the water as Devadas broke his promise. Devadas and his soldiers then wounded themselves with swords and suddenly the goddess appeared and joined them. The alagu seva ritual commemorates this event and invokes Sowdeswari Amman. It is performed only by the Devanga people. The holy turmeric mixture, pandaram, is applied to the wounds to protect them from infection. The celebrants, called veerakumars, strike their bare chests with holy swords in a ritual dance. The ritual is also called alagu seva or katthi haakkadhu.

It was established in 1964 to train young people in important national matters. In 2019, the organization was transformed from a state department to a fully fledged semi-autonomous state corporation after enactment of NYS act, 2018 ] by the Kenyan parliament. National Youth Service officials in Nakuru National Youth Service marching on street in Nakuru The core business of NYS is to train and mentor Kenya's youth through : # Paramilitary and regimentation . # National building programs. # Technical and vocational training in various skills and trades . Enrollment to the service is voluntary for Kenyan youth aged between 18 –22 years old . Upon enlistment, the recruits are subjected to rigorous non-combat paramilitary training for 6 months . The recruits are required to offer at least 6 months of national service, which may include; *Construction *Vector control * Slums upgrade program * Traffic Control * Public security * Agriculture Before the late 1980s, students had to participate in the organisation before admission into universities. Today, recruitment is done on a volunteer basis. After successfully completing the compulsory national service, the recruits are send to technical and vocational schools within NYS to train in various fields such as agriculture, engineering and hospitality. The training is free of charge to all recruits .

While in Israel the movement was necessary to deal with existential threats from Palestine and Arab world, in Kenya the model was attractive to the government to instill national values to the young people and to rehabilitate the freedom fighters (mau mau). The Israeli had hoped to use the youth training as their entry point to Africa. And besides Kenya, they had such programmes in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda. The crafting of the NYS could have started earlier than is publicly acknowledged. In mid-1959, Mboya had led a delegation to Israel where he – and other African leaders – had been introduced to the Gadna-Nahal movement, during a six-week seminar. The conference was organised by the CIA- funded International Union of the Socialist Youth (IUSY), which frequently published Mboya’s articles on African socialism. Gadna was an acronym meaning youth formations, while Nahal meant fighting pioneer youth. These were youth organisations controlled and financed by the Israeli government to instil a sense of “national purpose”, and to “conduct civic and social duties”. Upon his return to Nairobi, Mr Mboya told the press: “In Israel I have seen youths trained so that they are a source of pride to the nation, and they are readily available for all sorts of national work programmes.” As a result of the lessons learnt in Israel, Mboya hoped to transform the youth wing of his People’s Congress Party into a formidable political tool. It was this Mboya- Kariuki group that would work with the Israelis to set up the National Youth Service all as part of Israel’s efforts to build close ties with the Kenyatta administration. Kenya had hoped to adopt Israel’s Nahal experiment in uniting the Kenyan tribes using the youth organisations. Israel also impressed upon president Kenyatta to embrace the Kibbutz idea – a collective community farming system manned by trained youth as pioneers. In February 1966, a Motion was brought to Parliament by Embu’s J.G. Mbogo seeking the disbandment of the Israeli-funded unit arguing that the youth were being trained “for somebody to stand up there and look very big”.To protect the Israeli project from disbandment, it was included as part of disciplined forces in the April 1966 amendment of the Kenya Constitution. Overall, the Nahal movement as crafted by the Israelis in East Africa failed. Steven Carol, a foreign policy scholar on the Nahal says that the East African experiment did not yield fruit because most of the youth were illiterate and unlike the Israelis “they had no avowed enemy, or marauding terrorists across the border.” With the failed NYS project, the Israelis now turned to training Kenyans in the field of intelligence and security. Later, the Chinese took over the funding and introduced pre-university training which was later abandoned . Not to be left behind, the Italians helped set up the Nyayo-bus project which again collapsed. Over the years, NYS has had to redefine itself to take a life of its own after the failed Israeli model .The first director, Geoffrey Griffin, a distinguished disciplinarian steered the organisation through the early turbulent years to stability (1964-1988). NYS remained an obscure and meagerly funded organisation government department for many years until 2013 when the president Uhuru Kenyatta government decided to make it a major institution for youth empowerment . NYS budget was increased by 1000% in 2014 .But there was problem;the organization had severely limited human resource capacity to manage huge budgets nor technical capacity to carry out the projects it claimed it could do . Many of the NYS rank and file have limited education, limited experience and ethical attitude to manage the huge budgets.Further the organization has over the years become unnecessarily over militarized therefore thwarting internal accountability and professionalism .What followed was massive misuse and monumental wastage of the public funds . To address these challenges, the government in 2018 began a journey of reforms at NYS that was aimed at dealing with endemic integrity problems, building capacity and professionalizing the organization .NYS was made a parastatal with a council to run its affairs _Members of the NYS council_ # Maj.

A large, fortified settlement thought to have been occupied during the Iron Age II period (1,100-600BC), the site has been explored by archaeologists since an Australian expedition started work there in 1994 after the discovery of pottery shards by a local resident. It has yielded the oldest known example of writing found to date in the UAE, a pottery shard with an inscription, thought to be Sabean, with the letters 'bml'. It is considered one of the significant Iron Age sites in the UAE. Excavations have shown the buildings within the site were damaged by a widespread fire. The first evidence of writing in the UAE was found in this site, on a piece pottery with the three letters of the South Arabic (B, M, L). Muweilah is one of the sites on the UAE's preliminary list to be nominated in the future to the World Heritage List.  Foundation  Carbon dating artefacts found at Muweilah puts the settlement's original date of establishment at between 850 and 800 BC and it enjoyed a brief heyday before being destroyed in a fire around 600BC. Constructed in the main from interlocked mud bricks and mud/stone brick walls, the walled settlement itself surrounds a large walled enclosure with seven buildings, thought to have provided living quarters as well as an administrative centre. This central building contained at least twenty columns and has been a rich trove for archaeologists, with extensive finds of painted and spouted vessels, iron weapons and hundreds of bronze pieces.  Trade  Enabled by the domestication of the camel in the region, thought to have taken place around 1,000 BC, Muweilah's trade included the manufacture of copper goods, with \\"extensive casting spillage from the manufacture of copper items found throughout the site\\". A terracotta camel found during early digs stands as the most complete find of its kind and facsimiles of the piece currently decorate the gateway to the Sharjah Archaeological Museum. Other finds from the site include items imported from Iran, Iraq and Yemen and indicate extensive trading links. Muweilah is relatively unique in its early and extensive adoption of iron goods, thought to have been imported from Iran. Hundreds of grinding stones indicate the consumption of both barley and wheat. Although now some 15 km inland today, it is thought that in its heyday, Muweilah would have been located on a khor or creek.

Bharali is about 2 Km away from Hatbor, a place of historical importance under Kaliabor subdivision in Nagaon district in the Indian state of Assam. People of this place are mostly agriculture oriented and are guided by rich sattria (Eksarana religion) culture. History For about 150/200 years Bharali Naamghar was situated in the then' Bamgaon',currently known as 'Daulpukhuri'. Bapuram Deo of Balisatra took the initiative in establishing the Naamghar. Sadly, the Naamghar was burnt down by the Burmese Army(during Burmese invasion in Assam between 1817 and 1826). Having no other option the villagers left the place and reestablished the same in Bharali Gaon. Accordingly ,the Naamghar popularly known as Bharali Naamghar. One of the interesting facts about Bharali Naamghar is the 'Laikhuta'(main pillar of the building) made by Tulsi tree(holy Basil). There are faiths and beliefs about the Laikhuta and preserved well near 'Simhasana' or 'Guruasana'. It is believed that Bharali Naamghar is the holy place to visit for fulfilling wishes. The local senior people used to say that the Naamghar is the rest house of 'Burha Dangoria'(holy sprit). Infrastructure The infrastructure of Bharali Naamghar has totally changed with time. With the help of local people and devotees from different places bamboo poles, thatched roof, mud floor are replaced with cement pillar, tin and ceiling, modern floor style respectively. Keeping in view the increasing number of devotees, now the facilities of the washroom, rest house, guest house, banquet hall, auditorium, etc. are provided by the naamghar managing committee. The finance is properly and strictly managed by the committee. Cultural Fastival Maghi Purnima or Makar Sankranti is an auspicious day. On this day thousands of devotees visit Bharali Naamghar to fulfill their wishes . A lot of devotees come to the Naamghar especially in the sacred month of Bhado (August -September) and Maagh (January–February). Spirituality lies in the sound of Doba and Borkaah(instruments to play during prayer) that removes negative power and welcomes the positive. To perform 'Naam-Prasanga'(communal prayer) and 'Bhaona'(theatrical performance) in Srimanta Sankardeva(Vaishnava guru) Tithi (observatory day) and Shree Shree Madavdeva (Vaishnava guru and disciple of Srimanta Sankardev)Tithi is a tradition in Bharali Naamghar. It is said that if a child is unable to walk in time people offer bamboo stick to the Naamghar ,if someone lost his cow people offer Diya(oil lamp),as a remedy of late marriage devotees visit with Diya and Sarai(raw fruits,Maah -Prasad as offering). Individuals can feel the existence of divine power in the Naamghar.

The case is a milestone for forensic criminal investigators due to the utilization of a tool then-novel to the field: genetic genealogy. The case broke ground on two fronts: it was the first to be tried in a court of law using the new technology, and it was also the first of such cases to result in a conviction.  Events prior to the murders  Cook and Van Cuylenborg met in high school and had been in a relationship for about six months. On 18 November 1987, they left in Cook's father's bronze 1977 Ford Club van for an overnight trip to the Seattle area to purchase parts for Cook's father's business. Cook and Van Cuylenborg took the MV Coho ferry from Victoria to Port Angeles, Washington. They then drove south-east on Route 101 to Bremerton, where they boarded a second ferry to Seattle. A fuel receipt later found in the van confirms that they purchased fuel on the road between Port Angeles and Bremerton. The pair were last seen boarding the ferry in Bremerton. Cook's and Van Cuylenborg's families became concerned when the couple did not return home as planned on 19 November and did not make contact. On 20 November, they were reported missing.  The murders  On 24 November, Tanya Van Cuylenborg's half-naked body was found in a ditch by a rural road near Alger, in Skagit County, Washington, a short distance south of Bellingham. She had been raped, bound with plastic ties and shot in the head. Investigators initially considered Cook a suspect, though both Cook's and Van Cuylenborg's families vehemently rejected this possibility. On 25 November, Tanya's wallet and keys were found discarded near the Greyhound station in Bellingham. The van was found a few blocks away. Inside the van were plastic ties of the same type used to bind Tanya, plastic gloves, and various receipts, including the Bremerton-Seattle ferry ticket, confirming the belief that the couple had taken the second ferry. However, Tanya's Minolta X-700 35 mm camera, which she had brought on the trip, was missing and has never been recovered. On 26 November, Jay Cook's body was discovered nearly 60 miles from where Tanya's body had been found two days earlier. Jay had been beaten with rocks and strangled.  Investigation and later events  The police believed that the killer was taunting them by leaving the plastic gloves in plain view. Detective Robert Gebo of the Seattle Police Department stated: \\"He leaves those behind as a sign to the police that you needn't look for fingerprints because I wore these gloves. And he has confidence that there's nothing that's going to connect him with these crimes.\\" The police were in fact able to obtain the suspect's DNA from the van, but there was no match on any of the criminal databases. Despite the lack of a match, the police believed that the specific manner in which the victims were killed (which has not been revealed in detail publicly) suggested that the killer was familiar with the prison system. The lack of a match despite a potential prison background could be explained by the suspect having been incarcerated before DNA collection from criminals became commonplace or technologically possible. Investigators believed that the couple might have met their killer on one of the ferries, most likely the second one, and offered him a ride upon reaching Seattle. In the months after the murders, both victims' families received a series of taunting greeting cards featuring graphic descriptions of the murders. The cards bore postmarks from Seattle, Los Angeles and New York, and were written by the same person. In 2010, it was announced that the writer of the cards had been found: a 78-year-old Canadian transient with mental health issues. The police confirmed that he was not the killer and had no connection to the crime. = Perpetrator = On 11 April 2018, a composite sketch of the suspect was released based on the DNA collected from semen found on Van Cuylenborg's trousers at the crime scene using a process called \\"snapshot DNA phenotyping\\" by Parabon Nanolabs. The case was also investigated by Parabon using genetic genealogy by uploading the DNA to the public website GEDmatch.com, the same site that led to the arrest of the Golden State Killer suspect Joseph James Deangelo. A second cousin, Chelsea Rustad, and another undisclosed distant cousin from the other side of the tree, were identified from GEDmatch. Based on genetic genealogy, William Earl Talbott II, 55, a truck driver, became the prime suspect. Police tested a paper cup Talbott had abandoned and found his DNA matched exactly. On 18 May 2018, the Snohomish County Sheriff announced that Talbott was arrested for the murder of Van Cuylenborg. Talbott's parents lived seven miles away from the bridge over the Snoqualmie River where Cook was found. The case, and specifically finding the killer via public genealogical websites, was featured on a Season 4 episode of the Criminology podcast. The case was also featured on the television program Unsolved Mysteries during the episode that NBC aired on October 25, 1989. = Legal proceedings = Talbott was charged in May 2018 for the murder of Van Cuylenborg. On June 16, 2018, a second aggravated first- degree murder charge was added for the murder of Jay Cook. Talbott pleaded not guilty to both these charges. He was held on $2.5 million bail, and his trial was originally scheduled to take place in late March or early April 2019; it was then moved to June 3 but began on June 11 and ended on June 28 with Talbott being found guilty. He was originally eligible for the death penalty, but because Washington State Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional, he was instead given two sentences of life in prison and has since been moved to the Washington State Penitentiary. Talbott is now trying to appeal his conviction. = Documentaries = Following the conclusion of the case, two documentaries were released on Canadian television, as well as in the United States, covering the events of the Talbott case, exploring how investigative genetic genealogy was used to identify the killer. The first was \\"Is murder in your DNA?\\", the 45th-season premiere of The Fifth Estate, which debuted online on 20 September 2019, and aired on CBC on 22 September 2019. The second was \\"Family Secrets\\", the 54th-season premiere of W5, which aired on CTV and debuted online on 21 September 2019. The case was profiled in HLN's Forensic Files II in the ninth episode, titled Family Tree. Chelsea Rustad, the genetic witness whose DNA identified her second cousin William Earl Talbott II, wrote a book chronicling her experiences with the Talbott case, titled Inherited Secrets: Memoir of America's Groundbreaking Genetic Witness. In the ABC documentary series The Genetic Detective, which stars CeCe Moore, one of the first geneticists to solve the case in just two hours in June 2019, is about the murder and solving the case.

She is the granddaughter of Abraham Fraenkel. She studied psychology and statistics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and earned her master's degree in statistics from Hebrew University as well as another master's degree and a Ph.D. degree in clinical psychology from Stony Brook University. Later she earned an M.B.A. from George Washington University. In 1987, she was appointed professor at Georgetown University Medical School, Washington DC, where she stayed until 1998 when she moved to George Washington University Medical School, Washington D.C. In 2005, she was appointed professor at Tel Aviv University Medical School. In 1984, Cohen-Mansfield founded the Research Institute on Aging at the Hebrew Home of Greater Washington, the largest nursing home in Maryland. In 2005, she established the Department of Health Promotion at the School of Public Health at Tel Aviv University, and in 2011, she opened the Minerva Center for Interdisciplinary Study of End of Life at Tel Aviv University. Since 1985, Cohen-Mansfield’s research has been funded by multiple foundations and government agencies such as the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Aging, the Alzheimer’s Association, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Israel Science Foundation, and the Minerva Foundation. Cohen-Mansfield has received multiple professional awards, including the Busse Research Award, the Barry Reisberg Award for Alzheimer’s Research, the Pfizer Quality Improvement Award, the Psychologists in Long-Term Care Outstanding Contribution Award, the Powell Lawton Distinguished Contribution Award in Applied Gerontology, the International Psychogeriatric Association 2015 Award for Distinguished Service to the Field of Psychogeriatrics, and fellowships in the Gerontological Society of America and the American Psychological Association.  Research  Cohen-Mansfield's research in the field of clinical gerontology focuses on understanding the experience of persons with dementia, improving the health and care of persons with dementia and other frailties, and promoting physical and mental health in all older adults. = Agitation/behavioral symptoms in persons with dementia = A pioneer in the study of behavioral symptoms in dementia, Cohen-Mansfield was the first to define agitation in persons with dementia. Using assessments she developed (see assessment section), Cohen-Mansfield was the first to identify the distinctive syndromes of agitation, namely verbal agitation, physically nonaggressive agitation, and aggressive agitation. This categorization has later been substantiated by studies with populations from around the world. Subsequently, Cohen-Mansfield examined the etiology of agitation in persons with dementia. She used the findings concerning etiology to develop the theoretical framework of unmet needs underlying agitated behavior, and to contrast it with alternative theories. The most common unmet needs are needs for meaningful activity, for social contact and for relief from pain and discomfort. This conceptualization became the basis for subsequent studies of non-pharmacological treatment of behavioral symptoms manifested by persons with dementia. For these studies she devised a decision tree algorithm (named Treatment Routes for Exploring Agitation; TREA) in order to assist caregivers in identifying the needs of the person with dementia, and matching the intervention to the unmet need and to the person’s unique preferences and abilities. She also investigated the specific non- pharmacological interventions utilized in the algorithm and their efficacy. Cohen-Mansfield’s work has challenged the prevailing paradigm that conceptualized agitation as a biologically caused mental illness symptom to be treated by psychoactive medications and physical restraints. As a result, guidelines and consensus statements regarding behavior problems in dementia now emphasize and require at least a trial of non-pharmacological interventions, and clinical management has become more person-centered. = Understanding persons with dementia = The unmet needs identified in the examination of etiology of agitation prompted several lines of research concerning those unmet needs. Several studies focused on the under-detection of pain experienced by persons with dementia and culminated in a study comparing different assessment instruments for pain and clarifying which type of assessment is optimal for detecting pain that is likely to respond to analgesic medication. Another line of studies concerning unmet needs pertained to the question of whether and how it is possible to engage persons with dementia with stimuli. The first series of papers examined the impact of individual stimuli on engagement within the context of the Comprehensive Process Model for Engagement of Persons with Dementia. Following findings regarding the potency of social stimuli, the focus shifted to group activities as they can provide both social contact and engaging activities. Cohen- Mansfield investigated the feasibility and utility of group activities for persons with dementia using a theoretical model modified for a group setting. Tailoring activities and lifestyle to past and current preferences of people with dementia emerged as a leading principle of care, leading to the investigation of the retained self-identities of persons with dementia and older persons’ and caregivers’ perceptions of those identities. This focus on individualization of care activities also led to an examination of preferences in self-maintenance activities, such as preferences concerning environmental conditions during sleep. Other lines of research included the impact of physical restraints on persons with dementia that included the first articles published on the methods and impact of removal of physical restraints. Along the same philosophy of care was a study of double blind randomized removal of psychotropic medication for persons with dementia. Another group of studies involved challenging the current paradigms concerning psychotic symptoms in persons with dementia and showing how delusions could most often be explained by the cognitive symptoms of dementia. = End of life = When advance directives were enacted in the U.S., Cohen-Mansfield examined preferences for life sustain interventions among nursing home residents and hospital patients, and the actual care provided vs. stated preferences for such interventions in the nursing home setting. More recent investigations describe the end of life period in terms of its cost trajectories, quality, and other characteristics. = Mental health promotion for older persons = Cohen-Mansfield has initiated and directed multiple studies concerned with prevention of decline and promoting well-being in older persons. These included studies on topics such loneliness among older persons, physical activity by frail older persons, a comparison of interventions to help persons who complain of memory problems, retirement planning courses, health behaviors in old age, and use of technology to improve wellbeing. She also co-edited a book on wellbeing among the oldest-old. = Health services research = As part of her work in nursing homes and other settings for persons with dementia, Cohen-Mansfield examined some of the systems in which care is provided. She studied staff stress in nursing homes and the ensuing turnover and absenteeism, as well as back injuries back injuries experienced by staff members. In an effort to examine ways for improving the settings of care, she co-edited a book on satisfaction surveys in long-term care. She also studied specific services for addressing mental health issues of persons with dementia, such as the underutilization of adult day services for persons with dementia, the use of psychiatric consultations within the nursing home, and the characteristics of transitional care units that aim to help caregivers support the persons with dementia who manifest the most challenging symptoms. Within her studies on mental health promotion of older persons, Cohen-Mansfield examined specific services, including services within Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs), intergenerational activities, the use and impact of telephone hotlines for older persons and their caregivers, and the use of migrant in- home caregivers. = Methodology = Some of Cohen-Mansfield’s work concerns exploration of methodological dilemmas or the development of new methodological approaches for addressing complex methodological challenges. = Assessments = The exploration of new frontiers in aging research in general and in dementia research in particular necessitated the development of assessment instruments to examine these new areas. Therefore, Cohen-Mansfield developed multiple assessment instruments on diverse topics, including agitation in persons with dementia, preferences for life sustaining treatments, quality of life values, observed sleep patterns, medical decision- making, pain in persons with dementia, and others. Cohen-Mansfield developed two instruments for assessing agitation, an informant-rating assessment, the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and a behavior mapping observational assessment, the Agitation Behavior Mapping instrument (ABMI). The most well-known and widely used of her assessments is the CMAI, in which the primary caregiver rates the frequency with which persons with dementia manifest different agitated behaviors. The CMAI has been translated into over 20 languages, and is used for clinical purposes and research worldwide.  Publications  Cohen-Mansfield has published over 350 publications in scientific journals and books. According to an editorial in the Journal of Gerontology, she is one of the 19 most highly cited gerontologists according to ISI. = Books = # Cohen-Mansfield, J., Ejaz, F.K. & Werner, P. (Eds.).

It was formed in 2016 to lead the health profession’s response to climate change in the United Kingdom. The Alliance brings together doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals to advocate for better responses to climate change that protect and promote public health. UKHACC emphasises the health co-benefits of tackling climate change, and raises awareness about the relationship between health and climate change. The Alliance has campaigned on air pollution and coal phase-out. On 30 March 2017, UKHACC highlighted in a letter to the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, that “more work is urgently needed to prepare the personnel, the systems and the facilities of the NHS, as well as other institutions involved in health care, for the implications of climate change.” On the topic of coal, the Alliance has noted that coal, as a driver of climate change, damages human health indirectly by increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like floods and heatwaves. In June 2019 UKHACC was one of several concerned environmental organisations to write to the then Prime Minister, Theresa May, urging her to urgently commit to the recommendation of the independent Committee on Climate Change for the UK to set a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050. On 12 June 2019, the Prime Minister responded by confirming that a 2050 target would be set in law, the legislation being passed later that month.

Geography  Near the exit the valley is narrow but farther up it fans out into several lateral branches, above which rise the rounded summits of the Western Tatras, the highest of which is Mt. Bystrá, on the Slovakia side of the frontier. The upper part of the valley (the Hala Tomanowa and Hala Pyszna) have been constituted strict nature reserve, thus forming a sanctuary for the flora and fauna peculiar to them. The whole valley is pervaded with the aura of old legends about hidden treasure.Dolina Kościeliska There are ancient mining traditions going as far back on the 15th century. In the 19th century Kościeliska valley was one of the strongest and biggest metallurgical centres in the area, in the neighbouring mountains various metals were found, mainly silver, later on also iron ore.Dolina Kościeliska (Kościeliska Valley) This valley owes its exceptional charm not only to its beauty spots, but also to its numerous forms of characteristic of limestone country: caves, wells, shaped rocks and crags. There are about 70 larger and smaller caves here, the longest of which are Jaskinia ZimnaJaskinia Zimna (6 km) or Jaskinia Wysoka – Za Siedmiu Progami Jaskinia Wysoka - Za Siedmiu Progami (11,5 km), and the deepest Jaskinia Miętusia (200 m) or Bańdzioch Kominiarski (570 m).Bańdzioch Kominiarski Among the most interesting tourist spots in the valley are:Things to do in Zakopane * Lodowe Źródło (Icy Spring) * Jaskinia Mroźna (Frosty Cave), Jaskinia Mylna (False Cave), Jaskinia Raptawicka (Raptawicka Cave)Jaskinie tatrzańskie – Dolina Kościeliska * Wąwóz Kraków i Smocza Jama (Kraków Gorge with Dragon’s Den) - one of the most picturesque part of the valley. * Hala Pisana (Pisana Alp) * Staw Smerczyński (Smreczyński Pond) Trails In the lover part of the Dolina Kościeliska the red trail branches off Polana Upłaz, and takes one to the summit of Ciemniak (2,090 metres AMSL), a mountain in the Czerwone Wierchy (Red Mountains) group of peaks.

About the Centre  The International Centre for Chinese Heritage and Archaeology is a collaboration between the School for Archaeology and Museology of Peking University and the Institute of Archaeology, UCL, to promote the exchange of archaeologists between Europe and China. The ICCHA regularly hosts world-class conferences, invites visiting scholars, enables exchange and communication between Chinese and British archaeologist, seeking to bridge the gap in archaeological thought and theory.  History of the Centre  The Centre owes much to the vision of Peter Ucko, former director of the Institute of Archaeology, UCL. True to his commitment to world archaeology, Ucko developed a keen interest in China, and sought to bring Chinese archaeology into the world archaeology. With the help of Wang Tao, then Lecturer in Chinese art and archaeology at SOAS and others, he developed links with archaeological departments in the People's Republic of China, and arranged for two joint posts in Chinese archaeology to be shared between UCL and SOAS, one of which was taken by Wang. The International Centre for Chinese Heritage and Archaeology (ICCHA) was officially launched in Beijing on 15 December 2003, with the full support of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People's Republic of China, with joint offices in London and Beijing, forming the first such venture between China and the United Kingdom. With Ucko as its first director (2003-2007), the ICCHA soon yielded several collaborative projects in training and research, and resulted in a number of scholarships for Chinese students to be trained in archaeology at UCL. In 2006 Ucko and Wang travelled to ten Chinese cities, interviewing academic archaeologists about how they taught the subject, with the aim of publishing their findings, but Ucko's untimely death prevented this.A festschrift titled A Future for Archaeology, edited by Robert Layton, Stephen Shennan and Peter Stone, was produced in Ucko's honour in 2006.

She underwent hunger and thirst strikes when she was sent to jail and was released under the Cat and Mouse Act.  Early life  Arabella Charlotte Scott was born on 7 May 1886 in Dunoon, Scotland. Her mother was a teacher and her father served as a captain in the British army for more than 25 years. She graduated with an MA from the University of Edinburgh and went on to become a school teacher, living with her family in Edinburgh. Arabella and her sisters were advocates for women's suffrage and were active speakers in Scotland for the cause.  Campaigning for women's suffrage  In 1909, Arabella and her sister Muriel were both arrested on the charge of obstruction in London after they tried to hand a petition to the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, on this charge the sisters served 21 days at HM Prison Holloway. Arabella Scott was arrested and released several times over the following years, under the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913, known by suffragettes as the Cat and Mouse Act. The Cat and Mouse Act was put into place so that suffragettes could not die in prison due to hunger strikes, instead when they became too weak they were released and then re-arrested at a later time to complete their sentences. On the 6 April 1913, she was arrested again, for trying to set fire to a racecourse stand at Kelso Racecourse along with Agnes and Elizabeth Thomson, Edith Hudson, and Donald M'Ewan. Following their trial, on 19 May 1913, Arabella Scott, Edith Hudson and Donald M'Ewan were sentenced to nine months, Elizabeth Thompson, three months, and Agnes was released. They were imprisoned at Calton jail and went on hunger strike together. Scott was released under the Cat and Mouse Act on 24 May, her licence ran out and she failed to return to Calton jail. Scott was caught on 12 June and rearrested, when she returned to Calton jail she went on hunger strike again. On the 16 June she was assessed as too weak by a medical officer and was released on licence but did not return to the jail. Scott was found in London on the 24 August and returned to Calton jail where she went on hunger and thirst strike. On 28 August the medical officer put her forward for immediate discharge due to her health, however she had to be removed from the jail by force as she did not want to be placed on leave under licence once more. The licence expired on 10 September 1913, Scott was not found until the following year. Scott continued to work as an organiser for the Women's Social and Political Union in the Brighton branch under the name, 'Catherine Reid', she was found in May 1914 and resisted arrest. Scotland Yard and the Brighton Police both had to help the police that had come from Scotland to arrest Scott as she refused to walk and had to be lifted and dragged onto trains. She started her hunger and thirst strike on 2 May when she was arrested, and by 8 May was ill and allowed to leave the Calton jail under licence. On 17 May Scott departed for London so that she could help the WSPU campaign against the liberal candidate in the Ipswich by-election. She was due to return to jail on 22 May. She was found on 19 June during a raid at a suffragette house, where she was rearrested and forced to return to jail. Scott was given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU.  Force-feeding at Perth prison  Scott was taken to Perth prison, instead of Calton jail, she was admitted on 20 June and released on 26 July. Despite an appeal to prison authorities by Janie Allan on her behalf, warning of dangerous protests during a royal visit, if Scott was force-fed, she suffered this throughout her imprisonment three times a day. She was not allowed visitors or letters during her imprisonment. In her autobiography, My Murky Past, compiled and edited by her niece, Frances Wheelhouse, from taped interviews, Scott described a force-feeding tube being driven into her stomach as bits of her broken teeth washed around with blood in her mouth. When she vomited after it was removed, Watson would shout at her 'You did that on purpose'. Scott also recalled that one day Watson had said to her, \\"Look here, it's a pity, why don't you give it all away? The government would send you over to Canada and I would personally conduct you there.\\" She replied, \\"That would be tantamount to saying that all this protest of mine was in vain and wrong and I would be giving in.\\" Scott was once more released under licence under the Cat and Mouse Act. On 28 June 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, two days after Scott's release the First World War began, with the UK joining by declaring war on Germany on 4 August. The WSPU announced a truce on militant acts, the Secretary of Scotland announced on 10 August the mitigation of all suffragette sentences passed in Scottish courts including Scott's. A fictional account, based on Arabella Scott's ordeal has since been dramatised by the playwright, Ajay Close, who researched the play based on Watson's reports held in the National Archives of Scotland and from the select transcripts of taped interviews with Arabella Scott, provided by Frances Wheelhouse.  Later life  Scott, under her married name Colville- Reeves emigrated to Australia. She died on 27 August 1980, and her memorial is in the Palmdale Lawn Cemetery on the Central Coast of New South Wales.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/135143776/arabella-charlotte- colville_reeves  See also  * Suffragette * Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom * Frances Gordon * Fanny Parker *Maude Edwards  References  1886 births 1980 deaths Scottish suffragists Alumni of the University of Edinburgh People from Dunoon Scottish women activists British women's rights activists Women's Social and Political Union Hunger Strike Medal recipients ","title":"Arabella Scott"},{"id":"55965172","text":"Eric Cartman is a central character from the adult animated series South Park.

The 287th overall episode of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on December 6, 2017. The episode, which parodies support for Donald Trump among white middle-class Americans, depicts the people of South Park as they deal with sightings of President Garrison that frighten their children, likening him to the antagonists of popular works of horror, including Stranger Things and the 2017 feature film adaptation It. Subplots in the story focus on relationships among the regular and recurring characters, including the conclusion of Eric Cartman and Heidi Turner's relationship, and a burgeoning romance between PC Principal and Strong Woman, with which the episode explores the themes of self-victimization and cultural views of workplace relationships. The episode's title is a reference to the icon used to denote films with low critical scores on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Plot President Garrison has been spotted repeatedly in South Park, frightening the young daughter of Bob White and his wife with his constant inquiries about his approval rating. According to a local law enforcement official, Officer Bright, Garrison has become desperate and dangerous ever since he was given a \\"splatty tomato\\" approval rating. The Whites, who remain loyal supporters of Garrison, believe that their daughter's anxieties are caused by the political liberalism of the school administrators at South Park Elementary, PC Principal and Strong Woman, complaining, \\"No one cares about the Whites.\\" Sightings of Garrison continue, his presence heralded by red balloons bearing the campaign slogan \\"Make America Great Again\\", which Randy Marsh and the children of South Park realize bears similarities to Stranger Things and It. In the aftermath of his attack upon Toronto with a nuclear bomb in the previous episode, which killed over a million Canadians, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demands that Garrison be handed over to Canada, a call to which the Canadian-born Ike Broflovski responds. After he disappears, his brother Kyle Broflovski embarks on a search, joined by his friends. Eric Cartman and his girlfriend Heidi Turner join the search, but Heidi's recent behavior spurs Kyle to denounce the person that she has become, humbling her. At a town meeting, Mayor McDaniels tells the townspeople that Officer Bright is leading the search for Garrison. When she assures the assembled crowd that she understands that they all wish to get rid of Garrison, Bob White objects. When Randy points out to White all the things Garrison has been doing, White responds that Hillary Clinton would not have been any better. When Bright informs the public that authorities have set up a \\"fox trap\\" to capture Garrison, which is actually a fake interview with Fox News, the Whites help Garrison evade it by warning him. Randy and his neighbors search the woods, and when they find a campsite, they discover in the tent PC Principal and Strong Woman in bed together. The sight of two co- workers in a relationship horrifies Randy and the others, who vomit in response. Ike, wearing the uniform of a Canadian Mountie, captures Garrison and drags him bound and gagged back into town. This provokes Bob White to pull out a gun, but Heidi then grabs it and holds Cartman at gunpoint. She blames him for the person she has become, but Heidi later realizes that she has been engaging in self-victimization ever since she began seeing Cartman. He threatens to kill himself again, but Heidi, no longer moved by his attempts at manipulation, breaks up with him. As this occurs, Garrison escapes.

Club gave the episode a B- rating but did not like how President Garrison was used in the episode, commenting \\"Whenever a Trump/Garrison storyline goes nowhere, it's likely because Parker and Stone just don’t have that much more to say about him.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a 7.9 out of 10 rating, commenting that the episode \\"didn't quite combine its many concurrent plot threads into a cohesive whole, but it did a better job of tying up loose ends than most. And in some ways, the lack of closure in the final moments only played into the larger themes and topical humor.\\" Joe Matar with Den of Geek gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars rating, stating in his review \\"I don't usually find South Park laugh out loud funny these days and Season 21 has been mostly weak, so 'Splatty Tomato' was a nice surprise in that it was well- plotted, had some clever gags, and ended with a clear moral for Heidi, Cartman, and the Whites: 'if you always make yourself the victim, you can justify being awful.'\\" Jeremy Lambert with 411Mania gave the episode a 6.5 out of 10 rating, stating in his review \\"The episode had some funny moments. The bad 80s music played for some nice laughs and I lost it at the FOX trap. But the goal of this episode didn't seem to be 'make people laugh.' It seemed to be 'make people realize that America sucks right now.' Mission accomplished, Matt and Trey.\\" Dani Di Placido with Forbes praised the episode in his review, stating \\"regardless of your political alignment, the overarching message from this season, to stop playing the victim, stop othering the opposing side, and to just calm the hell down, is difficult to argue with. Despite the show's reputation for reckless offensiveness, I would argue that South Park is one of the few voices of reason in the media landscape today.\\" Ben Travers with IndieWire gave the episode a B- rating, stating in his review \\"Parker and Stone have always skewered everyone. They'll go after the easy targets, like Trump, and the hard targets, like P.C. culture.

The Federal Government Junta () was a civil-military triumvirate which temporarily assumed power in Bolivia after Liberal party victory in the Federal Revolution of 1899. It was composed of Colonel (later, General) José Manuel Pando, Serapio Reyes Ortiz (previously the Prefect of La Paz Department), and doctor Macario Pinilla Vargas. The Junta was proclaimed on December 12, 1898, led the Liberal effort in the Revolution, and governed Bolivia from April 12 to October 25, 1899. It carried out various institutional reforms and erected public works, such as the construction of the Palace of Government in La Paz. In 1899, a National Convention elected Pando president, replacing the Junta.  Precedents  During the presidency of conservative Severo Fernández Alonso the so-called Federal Revolution Federal began, a civil war between the elites of La Paz and Sucre, and between liberals and conservatives, aligned respectively with these two cities. After four months of combat, the Liberals defeated the Conservatives at the Battle of Segundo Crucero. The Federal Junta consolidated its power over Bolivia.  Work of the Junta  On April 14, 1899, doctors Macario Pinilla and Serapio Reyes, in the name of the Federal Government Junta proclaimed a decree declaring the city of La Paz as the definitive capital of the Republic of Bolivia. Pando, who ascended to the rank of General on the same day, did not sign the decree because he considered it imprudent and contrary to the goal of pacifying the country. The National Convention was installed in Oruro on October 20, 1899. Its goal was to elect a new president. But first, the assembled delegates recognized the Constitution of 1880 as the binding law of the land. Nonetheless, they left open the possibility of a fundamental or partial reform of the constitution, if supported by a simple majority of votes and subject to the legal requirements set out in the constitution. General Pando was elected President of Bolivia on October 23, 1899, with Lucio Pérez Velasco as his First Vice President and Aníbal Capriles as his second Vice President.

It was constructed in 2017 to supply 129 MWh at 100 MW. It was expanded in 2020 to 194 MWh at 150 MW. The original installation in 2017 was the largest lithium-ion battery in the world. Despite the expansion, it lost that title in August 2020 to the Gateway Energy Storage in California, USA. Diagram of power and duration of the two applications of phase one of the battery During 2017 Tesla, Inc. won the contract and built the Hornsdale Power Reserve, for a capital cost of A$90 million, leading to the colloquial Tesla big battery name. In November 2019, Neoen confirmed that it was increasing capacity by a further 50MW/64.5MWh to a combined 185 MWh. The increased storage capacity was installed by March 23, 2020, and the increased power became operational in early September 2020. Construction South Australia received 90 proposals and considered 5 projects to build a grid-connected battery to increase grid stability under adverse weather events. This will enable less use of gas-fired generators to provide grid stability. Elon Musk placed a wager that the battery would be completed within \\"100 days from contract signature\\", otherwise the battery would be free. Tesla had already begun construction, and some units were already operational by 29 September 2017, the time the grid contract was signed. The battery construction was completed and testing began on 25 November 2017. It was connected to the grid on 1 December 2017. The days between grid contract and completion easily beat Musk's wager of \\"100 days from contract signature\\", which started when a grid connection agreement was signed with ElectraNet on 29 September 2017, days after Musk's offer on 10 March (in Australia). Samsung 21700-size cells are used. =Expansion= In November 2019, Neoen announced that it would increase the battery capacity by 50%. The expansion would cost , funded by from the state government, from ARENA and up to in cheap loans through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The expansion was completed by Aurecon on 2 September 2020. Operation It is owned and operated by Neoen, with the state government having the right to call on the stored power under certain circumstances. Phase one provided a total of of storage capable of discharge at into the power grid, which is contractually divided into two parts: # 70 MW running for 10 minutes (11.7 MWh) is contracted to the government to provide stability to the grid (grid services) and prevent load-shedding blackouts while other generators are started in the event of sudden drops in wind or other network issues. This service has reduced the cost of grid services to the Australian Energy Market Operator by 90%. # 30 MW for 3 hours (90 MWh) is used by Neoen for load management to store energy when prices are low and sell it when demand is high. On 14 December 2017, at 1:58:59 am, the HPR reacted when unit A3 at Loy Yang Power Station tripped. As its generators spun down over the next 30 seconds, the loss of its 560 MW of base power caused a dip in the system frequency. By 1:59:19, the frequency had fallen to 49.8 Hz, and triggered HPR's response, injecting 7.3 MW into the grid and effectively helping to stabilise the system before the Gladstone Power Station was able to respond at 1:59:27. This synchronverter reaction is a built-in feature, but had not previously been effectively demonstrated. During two days in January 2018 when the wholesale spot price for electricity in South Australia rose due to hot weather, the battery made its owners an estimated () as they sold power from the battery to the grid for a price of around /MWh. Based on the first six months of operation, the reserve is estimated to earn about per year. (This is a third-party estimate, based on spot energy prices; it is possible that the HPR has contracted to provide power at a lower price, in exchange for a more certain income stream.) After six months of operation, the Hornsdale Power Reserve was responsible for 55% of frequency control and ancillary services in South Australia. By the end of 2018, it was estimated that the Power Reserve had saved in costs, mostly in eliminating the need for a fuel- powered 35 MW Frequency Control Ancillary Service. The battery usually arbitrages 30 MW or less, but in May 2019 began charging and discharging at around 80 MW and for longer than usual, increasing wind power production by reducing curtailment.

Biography  Mirza Muhammad Baqir was born in a village named Qehi in the vicinity of Isfahan. His father, Mulla Muhammad Jafar was an admirer of Sheikh Ahmad Ahsaei Ala Maqami. After learning the basics from his father, Mirza Muhammad Baqir travelled to Isfahan to continue his education, and resided in Nimavard School where he studied different sciences for several years. Then he met one of the admirers of Haj Muhammad Karim Kermani, (who was also known as “Badr”). Since Kermani was on a pilgrimage to Imam Reza's shrine in Mashhad through Yazd, he travelled to Yazd in the hope of visiting the great man in 1261 Hijri year. Since the path was dangerous, and Kermani had to return to Kerman, Mirza Muhammad Baqir accompanied him to Kerman, and resided in Ibrahimieh School, studying Islamic theology. In a short time he had reached a level where he could teach the lessons of his grand master. After several years, the date of which is not known, Kermani sent him to the city of Naein for preaching and guidance, where he spent some years preaching and proselytizing. Mirza Muhammad Baqir immediately gained the attention and respect of the Sheikhieh members of Nain, Anarak, Jandaq, Biabanak and the surrounding cities. Then he returned to Kerman, Until Kermani left for a pilgrimage to Karbala in 1283 Hijri year. When Kermani arrived in Hamedan, because of the great number of Sheikhieh adherents, and also lack of great leaders after the demise of Mullah Abdulsamad Hamedani, he appointed Mirza Muhammad Baqir as a leader in his absence, and continued his pilgrimage to Karbala. Mirza Muhammad Baqir stayed in Hamedan since his mentor had mandated it. He engaged in preaching, proselytizing and teaching Islamic principles for 32 years. He was a great leader and protector for the Sheikhieh members after the demise of his mentor, until 1315 Hijri. In Eid al-Fitr of 1315, when the riots of Hamedan occurred, he migrated to Jandaq village and stayed there for the rest of his fruitful life, teaching Islamic principles and preaching. Mirza Muhammad Baqir died on the 23rd of Sha’ban 1319, at the age of 80. After Maqrib and Isha prayer. This great man was buried in the same village, but after two years, his body was moved to Mashhad, to be laid to rest in Imam Reza's shrine, next to his Imam. He has left more than 190 manuscripts and almost 2000 sermons and teachings. Mohammad Ibrahim, the third son of Mohammad Baqir Sabzavari, migrated to Qehi village for some reasons during the Safavid period (probably during the Afghan sedition, when the murder, looting, and cruel killing of the innocent people of Esfahan, especially the scholars and the Taliban of Shi'a) Settled at the end of the western western village. The castle, which dates back a long time, is one of the village's main buildings and seven houses. These seven houses are surrounded by a long wall and seven adorned towers, seven meters high. Several generations of descendants of Mohammad Baqir Mohaqeq Sabzewari lived in this castle. Hence, they are known as castle families. Later she selected Ashrafi, Bagheri and Bagheri scholars  Education  The passion for science and learning led him to meet Hajj Mohammad Karim Kermani. When he heard the visit of Hajj Mohammad Karim from Yazd to Mashhad, he was eagerly on his way. Because Hajj Mohammad Karim Kermani's visit was canceled, he went to Kerman with him and settled in Ibrahimya school. In summary, many years in Anjang and Kerman, in the presence of him, earned his grace for grace, until he was sent to the direction of guidance and guidance of the Nahinites; and after several years he returned to Kerman and continued to study with his teacher. He returned to Hamedan with the orders of the professor and the people of Hamedan and asked to publish the Ahlul-Bayt's facts. As long as in 1288, Hajj Mohammad Karim Kermani broke the world and some of his students who knew the knowledge and hardship of Haj Muhammad Baqir came to Nahrzad and came through Hamadan. Until the jealousy of his jealousy was burned in that day, and finally in Eid al-Fitr in 1315 AD. They attacked the Shaikhis of Hamedan, which killed some of its circle members and their emigration and their families to Ray and then to a village in the desert called Jandagh.

Career =Early life and career= Fredman was born on 22 April 1916 in Östersund, Sweden, the son of Reinhold Fredman, an accountant, and his wife Astrid Dahlström. He passed studentexamen in Sundsvall in 1935 and became fänrik in Västernorrland Regiment (I 21) in Sollefteå in 1939. Fredman was promoted to lieutenant two years later and attended the Royal Swedish Army Staff College becoming captain in 1947. He served as secretary in the Västernorrland County's officer training union from 1948 to 1959 and was a member of the Central Federation for Voluntary Military Training (Centralförbundet för befälsutbildning) from 1956. Fredman served as major in the staff of Härnösand's defence district in 1958. =Congo= Fredman was commanding officer of the Swedish Battalion XVIII K between October 1962 and May 1963. He was handpicked for the post deputy of battalion commander but as the regular battalion commander was asked to become head of sector Kamina in the State of Katanga, Fredman received direct command and responsibility of the battalion. Thus, it was he who with short notice, planned, led the attack and captured the town of Kaminaville during Operation Grandslam on New Year's Eve in 1962. The attack occurred without loss to the Swedes and without destruction of either the white or African district. The larger of the two captured Gendarmerie camps in Kaminaville was named by a soldier very frivolously to Camp Fred which also became the future name. The name (Fred, Swedish word for \\"Peace\\") partly referred to their mission as peacemakers and the UN peacekeeping mandate and partly as a tribute to their battalion commander Bengt Fredman. Early in the morning of 12 January 1963 in Kabundji, Fredman and his battalion surprised two Gendarmerie battalions on their payday and were disarmed, demobilized, were paid with their own war chest, declared to be civilians and sent home to their respective hometowns. =Later career= Back in Sweden in 1963, Fredman began serving in the Jämtland Ranger Regiment (I 5) and in 1966 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed head of the staff department and adjutant to the military commander of the Eastern Military Area (Milo Ö) in Strängnäs. Fredman was a member of the Swedish Order of Freemasons and Samfundet SHT. Personal life In 1941 he married Gun Wennberg (born 1920), the daughter of Bror Wennberg and Beda Östling. He was the father of Lars Olof (born 1945), Elisabeth (born 1950) and Lennart (born 1953). Fredman died on 31 December 2008 and was buried at the Eastern Cemetery in his hometown of Östersund.

Description Milk rice paper is a steamed rice crepe sheet that has been dried. The shape of milk rice paper is similar to that of much regular Vietnamese rice paper: round and thin. However, milk rice paper type has milky color, while regular rice paper is translucent. Moreover, milk rice paper does not have the same chewy texture as regular rice paper and is thicker and harder. Ingredients The basic ingredients used for making milk rice paper are: rice flour, cassava flour, water, salt, sugar, pandan leaves and coconut milk. The coconut milk is the key ingredient that ensures its distinctiveness. Additional ingredients such as durian, black sesame seeds, green rice, etc. are added to give it a variety of flavors.

Although milk rice paper cannot be combined with as many dishes as regular rice paper, people can still enjoy it straight out of the package or toasted on a fire to create a crunchier texture and bring out the coconut aroma. Traditional artisan villages As the Vietnamese village of Ben Tre has recently become a popular tourist destination, milk rice paper – its specialty – is also becoming better known. However, rice paper manufacturing is not a very profitable industry, so many artisan villages are disappearing. In order to save them, the Vietnamese government has facilitated close cooperation between the artisan villages, which aims to sustainable survival and development. Bảo Phương. (2016, December 10).

These villages still stick to the traditional production method of grinding rice, grating dried coconut, toasting sesame seeds, drying ingredients in the sunshine, etc. No additives are added. Thus, natural flavor is kept. Besides milk rice paper, these artisan villages also produce other products with various ingredients and usages such as rice paper with dried shrimps or with milk and eggs; rice paper for spring rolls or egg rolls, etc. These artisan villages work all year around, but most of their earnings come in connection with the Tet holiday. During Tet, an average artisan family makes a few hundred sheets per day, which means the productivity during this period is three times higher than in the normal season. Normally, with every 20 kilos of batter, 500-600 milk rice paper sheets can be produced. Appliance of technology in production Just a few years ago, the production process was still old-fashioned, relying mainly on menial labor and experience handed down from generation to generation. Therefore, productivity and consistency in quality and quantity was not guaranteed.

She used to run her own “salon” where she hosted many French (and even American) writers and painters of her time: Stéphane Mallarmé, Émile Zola, Marcel Proust, François Coppée, Henri Gervex, James Whistler and Édouard Manet.  Biography  Anne Rose Suzanne Louviot was born in Nancy in 1849. She was the daughter of a woman who worked as a laundress at Marshal Francois Certain De Canrobert's, and of an unknown father. Her laundress mother sold her 15-year-old daughter's virginity to Canrobert, so that her daughter would become Canorbert's mistress and receive an annuity for life of 500 francs per month. When the young girl turned 16, this enabled her to go in Paris, where she started a brief career as an actress. She played light comedies at The Théâtre des Variétés; the role of her lifetime there was the Venus Anadyomene, posing naked on her shell; at the Théâtre du Châtelet, she also played Offenbach's féeries. In 1874, after becoming a high-class prostitute, she met Thomas W. Evans, an extremely wealthy American dental surgeon who tended to many high-profile people, and even royal families. He made her his mistress and helped her settle down at 52, rue de Rome, where she held her “salon”, hosting all of the Parisian artistic avant-garde. Through this occasion, she became the mistress of Francois Coppée, Stéphane Mallarmé, Antonin Proust, as well as Edouard Manet's mistress and model. When Laurent died, she bequeathed her wealth to Victor Margueritte, her last favorite and “protégé”, with the exception of her allegoric portrait of Autumn (a painting by Manet, begun in 1882), which went to the Museum of Fine Arts of Nancy. Laurent was buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery (56th section).  Her \\"Salon\\"  Méry Laurent and Stéphane Mallarmé, 1896 The \\"salon\\" she ran was a place of exchanges which boosted the creative steps of those who patronized it: one could find there Edouard Manet and Henri Gervex, but also poets and writers such as Mallarmé, Coppée, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Proust (the author painted Méry Laurent's portrait through Odette de Crécy's character in Swann in loveIn 1880, Thomas W. Evans offered to Méry Laurent a house at 9 boulevard Lannes in Talus.The Swann's family house was inspired in Marcel Proust's novel was inspired by Mery Laurent's house.), or even Zola (who based his novel Nana on Méry Laurent).

In the foreword to the 1989 Columbia University Press reprint of the book, she commented that in writing it she had expected to find that the Peredvizhniki were all devoted followers of Nikolay Chernyshevsky and the other revolutionary democrats as stated in Soviet textbooks from 1932. An examination of the primary sources, however, revealed that their motives were more complex. In her foreword to the reprint (written in September 1988) she noted that the courtesy copies of her 1977 book that she had sent to Soviet museums and libraries at the time had not been available to the general reader there but she hoped that in the period of glasnost that the reprinting of her book would be propitious and be part of the general reassessment and rectification of history in the USSR.Valkenier, Elizabeth.

It was a secret structure initially, active between January and August 1944, and closely affiliated with the Soviet Central Committee of the Communist Party. The Bureau was organized between January and February 1944 based on a decree by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of the Bolsheviks regarding the takeover of power in postwar Poland. The founding date was January 10, 1944, when the Office manifesto has been issued officially. The Polish members of the Bureau declared themselves to have an overriding role over the PPR. The CBKP was an internal structure, and its personnel composition remained secret for the outside world even when others were informed of its very existence. The PPR authorities learned about the CBKP from a telegram received at the beginning of August 1944 in Lublin, similar to the PPR Secretary General Władysław Gomułka who was informed about it on July 18, 1944 in Warsaw.  Leadership  Aleksander Zawadzki Management of CBKP included: Aleksander Zawadzki - Chairman, Stanisław Radkiewicz - Secretary, Karol Świerczewski - Member, Jakub Berman - Member, Wanda Wasilewska - Member, Hilary Minc - Plenipotentiary, and Stefan Wierbłowski - Plenipotentiary. Berman was de facto in charge of the Bureau. The seven members were all approved by the Kremlin and had a significant impact on the Communists in Poland, as well as the Berling troops in the Soviet Union and in the country. Zawadzki, as CBKP chairman, was to hold the talks with representatives of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party. Together with Swierczewski, he was to keep watch over the army's political division and deal with the expansion of the Corps. Wasilewska was responsible for the activities of the Polish Patriots' Association. The internal affairs belonged to Berman, who, along with Radkiewicz, managed the Office. Minc was put in charge of developing a draft of future socio-economic policy in Poland. The propaganda matters belonged to Wierblowski.  Activities  CBKP was tasked with sovietizing the Executive Board of the Polish Patriots' Union along with the entire organization after the concept of PKN was abandoned. It had a say in all national affairs and the decisions of the PPR as well as its subordinate National State Council. The Bureau deliberated whether the PPR was not too 'sectarian'. It advised Gomułka to mitigate too harsh a wording on nationalization of industry. The office made sure that the formation of the local councils would not be perceived by the Poles as an attempt at sovietization. Also, the Bureau was in charge of filling the posts in the ZPP, the First Polish Army Corps in the USSR, and then in the Polish Army in the USSR. It led the search and record of Polish communists in the USSR, established the Polish Communist Partisan Staff, co-decided on the composition of the Polish National Liberation Committee and the content of the PKWN manifesto. In August 1944 the members of the office created the PPR Politburo which included Gomułka, Boleslaw Bierut, Jakub Berman, Hilary Minc and Aleksander Zawadzki (the last three of the CBKP team). In August 1944, the CBKP office was replaced with the Central Committee of the PPR in Moscow, which operated until 1948. In 1948, the group of former CBKP members removed Gomułka from the post of PPR secretary, in all actuality taking over the leadership of the party.

Other operations were launched by Allies, especially by the Royal Navy. The offensive was a repetition of the previous campaign in 1942 but resulted in a failed outcome.  Background  The past Soviet submarine offensive in 1942 resulted in heavy losses for the soviets but achieved to sink some ships and caused delays and concern for the Germans. This was achieved despite the presence of over 13000 defensive mines. Preparations were made in winter 1942 to prevent the intrusion of Soviet submarines in the open Baltic for the following year. A decisive element of the Axis blockade was laying a double anti-submarine net, named \\"Walrus\\" system, across the Gulf of Finland from Porkkala (Finland) to Naissaar (Estonia). Additionally, the German Navy laid 7,293 other new mines, while Finland laid 1,965 mines, in addition to the existing ones.  Offensive  At the beginning of the year the Soviets could engage in offensive four Stalinets-class submarines, nine Shchuka class and three Malyutka class. ShCh-323 was the first vessel to attempt passing the blockade but was sunk by mines on 30 April 1943 (five survivors). ShCh-303 failed to pass the nets and returned to Lavansaari after encounters with German vessels. ShCh-408 was detected and sunk by Finnish minelayer Ruotsinsalmi with depth charges, while ShCh-406 suffered the same fate by Finnish minelayer Riilahti and German small boats.http://kotisivut.fonet.fi/~aromaa/Navygallery/ After the failures of the Shchuka-class, the Soviets attempted to breakthrough with the more powerful S-9 and S-12: both of them never returned and were lost to mines in August 1943, marking an end of the Soviets attempt to penetrate the blockade.  Aftermath  Finnish minelayer Riilahti The Finnish minelayers Ruotsinsalmi and Riilahti has been actively engaged in the campaign, sinking one submarine each. On 23 August 1943, during another anti-submarine patrol, Riilahti was sunk by soviet motor torpedo boat TK-93.  Outcome  No Soviet attempt to break the Axis blockade achieved success: no ship was sunk by Soviet submarines in the Baltic Sea during 1943, making the outcome of the offensive a decisive Axis success.

Its body grows to around and has a mosaic pattern with a variety of colors. Rhacodactylus trachyrhynchus is a closely related species, but R. trachycephalus is smaller and has a number of other noticeable differences. R. trachycephalus is viviparous, giving birth to only one or two young a year. Its restricted humid forest habitat is vulnerable due to multiple threats. As a result of habitat reduction, low reproduction rate and small population, it is one of the rarest geckos in the world.  Taxonomy  Rhacodactylus trachycephalus was originally described by George Albert Boulenger in 1878. It was described as Chameleonurus trachycephalus the same year, also by Boulenger. In 2005, it was named as R. trachyrhynchus trachycephalus, a subspecies of Rhacodactylus trachyrhynchus, by Myers and again by Yuri Kaverkin in 2009. It was assigned to genus Rhacodactylus by Aaron M. Bauer in 2012, a treatment that produced the combination Rhacodactylus trachycephalus.  Description  R. trachycephalus has a body length of around and a snout- to-vent length of no more than , with its tail being roughly the same length as its body. The species' scales create a mosaic pattern, with patches of white, brown, grey, and green in various hues. Its toes are somewhat broad and it has a tail exhibiting prehensility. R. trachycephalus is closely related to Rhacodactylus trachyrhynchus, but has a number of noticeable differences. In particular, R. trachycephalus's body size is smaller than that of R. trachyrhynchus and it has larger eyes. In addition, R. trachycephalus has fewer scale rows on its midbody, as well as fewer scales in the area in between its eyes and nostrils; the scales that are in the eye-nostril area are also smaller than those on R. trachyrhynchus.  Behavior  R. trachycephalus is viviparous, with it and R. trachyrhynchus being the only two species in their genus to exhibit viviparity. Viviparity in geckos is exclusive to New Zealand. R. trachycephalus generally gives birth to no more than two young per year, which is a very low rate of reproduction and partially why the species is so rare. To maintain a high level of heat and humidity, a large number of R. trachyrhynchus individuals will sometimes collect close together in shelters, a characteristic that is also exhibited by Underwoodisaurus milii. R. trachyrnhynchus individuals sleep in tree holes with their family.  Distribution and conservation  R. trachycephalus is a rare species, living exclusively in New Caledonia. The species' range is extremely restricted; it only occurs on a small area of Isle of Pines and a small island off its shore, in humid forest habitats. The offshore island is small enough that its population could be completely destroyed in the event of a single disaster and both of these populations are extremely vulnerable. R. trachycephalus is an unlisted species on the IUCN Red List, but is protected in the Northern Province. Endemia.nc lists the species as Critically Endangered. The organism is threatened by illegal trade and fragmentation of habitat. Another factor is the infestation of the invasive little fire ant, which causes the offshore island populations to be especially at risk. It is also threatened by cats and rats, which prey on eggs, young, and adults; these invasive species, like the little fire ant, especially threaten the offshore island populations. These factors make it one of the most uncommon geckos alive currently, and possibly the rarest in the world.

Biography Him was born Jerzy Himmelfarb in 1900 to a Polish-Jewish family in Lodz, which was then in the Russian Empire and is now in Poland. After schooling and further education in Warsaw Him studied Roman Law in Moscow but left in 1917 when the Russian Revolution forced the closure of the university he was attending. He moved to Bonn and by 1924 had completed a PhD at the University of Bonn on the comparative history of religions before deciding to study graphic art in Leipzig. Him studied at the Leipzig Academy of Graphic Art but even before he graduated in 1928 was already undertaking commercial commissions. Him returned to Poland where, in 1933, he changed his name and also established a design partnership with Jan Le Witt. Working as Lewitt-Him, the two established a distinctive design style which combined cubist and surrealist elements, often in a humorous context. Their most notable work in Poland were illustrations for an experimental poetry group known as Skamander. GPO Him and Le Witt worked together in Poland for several years before, in 1937, they relocated the Lewitt-Him design business to London, following an exhibition of their work there by the publishers Lund Humphries. The pair quickly gained commercial contracts with London Transport and Imperial Airways as well as illustrating children's books, such as The Little Red Engine Gets a Name (1942) by Diana Ross. In London during World War II the partnership received notable commissions for information and public safety posters from, among others, the General Post Office, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the Ministry of Information. Him was naturalised as a British citizen in 1948 and the Lewitt-Him partnership enjoyed great success. Notable commissions included designing the giant umbrella tree for the Wet Weather section of the 1946 Britain Can Make It exhibition, the Guinness clock tower for Battersea Park Pleasure Gardens and murals for the Education Pavilion of the 1951 Festival of Britain. The Lewitt-Him partnership was dissolved in 1954, when Le Witt decided to focus on developing his abstract paintings and artworks. Him continued to work as a commercial designer. Among the advertising campaigns he illustrated was the 1950s Schweppeshire campaign for the Schweppes drinks company. Him's other clients numbered several airlines, including Pan-American Airways, El Al and American Overseas Airlines plus the publishers of Punch and Penguin Books. He continued to illustrate books but also designed exhibition stands, such as the Australia stand at the 1960 Ideal Home Exhibition and large window displays, notably for the De Bijenkorf store in Rotterdam and the 1961 Christmas windows for the Design Centre in London. From 1969 until 1977, Him taught graphic design at Leicester Polytechnic. Him was an active artist up until the very end of his life. Two retrospective exhibitions of his work have been held, one in 1976 at the London College of Printing and another in 1978 at the Ben Uri Gallery in London. An exhibition is currently on at the House of Illustration, London, until 10 May 2020. In 1977 Him was awarded the Francis Williams Book Illustration Award and in 1978 became a Royal Designer for Industry.

The river winds through the towns of Catigbian, Antequera, Balilihan, and Maribojoc to its mouth at Cortes. The river is navigable for up to for boats drawing 4 ft, and up to for rafts. Its name comes from the word abad which means to meet or to converge. At its mouth, the river opens up to an estuary, which consists of a mixed mangrove and nipa swamp. It covers about and has 32 mangrove species growing in its estuary; as a result, it is one of the Philippines' most diverse mangrove forests and is the third largest riverine mangrove forest in Bohol; despite the presence of endangered plant and animal species, there are no conservation or protection efforts. Historically prior to road construction, the river served as a waterway for the people going to and from the interior towns. Following the success of the Loboc River tours, there are river cruises from the Abatan River Visitor Center in Cortes to various communities upstream. Kayak exploration and stand-up paddle boarding are also available. The visitor center suffered severe damage from the 2013 Bohol earthquake. During World War II, a ship in the United States Navy was commissioned: USS Abatan (AW-4), a Pasig-class distilling ship, was named after the river. Flora and fauna The river basin is home to 273 plant species and 67 species of wild animals, as well as 8 species of fireflies, including Pteroptyx macdermotti which is very rare and endemic to the Philippines. The mangrove species Camptostemon philippinense (locally known as Gapas-gapas) is globally endangered and the rarest mangrove species in the Philippines. The Abatan River estuary is home to the following true mangrove species (with local names in parentheses): Animal varieties include mudskippers, rats, fruit bats like the Large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus), lizards like the mangrove skink (Emoia atrocostata) and water monitor (Varanus salvator), as well as ants, spiders and fiddler crabs. Snake species include the King cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), which is locally known as Banakon, Samar cobra (Naja samarensis), locally known as Ugahipon, and the Philippine whipsnake, locally known as Hanlulukay (Dryophiops philippina). A new species of shipworm (Lithoredo abatanicus) was identified in the river in June 2019, locally known as Antingaw.

As a result of that, Sandeep decides to quit hockey. As a grown young man, he meets Harpreet Kaur, a budding female hockey player who practices the sport at the same centre. They both develop an interest in each other. With intent of catching up with Harpreet, Sandeep joins the Hockey Centre again. He starts to become good at his game. Meanwhile, Sandeep and Harpreet develop a love affair. The coach, who is Harpreet’s uncle, finds out about their relationship and physically assaults Sandeep. Bikram, who had been constantly working for selection to the Indian Hockey Team, fails to make it to India camp. Bikram finds out that his brother is exceptionally good at drag flick and helps him get to the Indian team, where he practices under the coach Harry.

'Spids Nøgenhat' is the Danish name for liberty cap (psilocybe semilanceata), a psychedelic mushroom commonly found in Denmark. The lineup is identical to that of the psychedelic group Dragontears, which also shares members of Baby Woodrose. The band released their debut album, En mærkelig kop te (A Strange Cup of Tea) in 2001, but was largely unknown until a national breakthrough in 2011, following a late-night performance at Roskilde Festival, which became one of the most talked about shows that year. Hours after the concert, into the early morning, people chanted the words from the chorus of the last song, \\"Er vi de sidste her på jorden?\\". A live LP of the show, titled De sidste her på jorden, was released the following year. Spids Nøgenhat's second album, Kommer med fred (2013), received considerable national airplay in Denmark and the LP charted on the top-20 sales list. In 2014 the group was awarded 'Live act of the year' and 'Danish rock release of the year' at the annual Danish Music Awards. In 2015 they were awarded 'Band of the year' and 'Live act of the year' at the Danish music critics' award show, Steppeulven. A book titled Mere Lys – Historien om Spids Nøgenhat (More Light – The Story of Spids Nøgenhat) by Lars Krogh and Thomas Løppenthin was published in 2015 to critical acclaim. The book tells the story about the band's perhaps unlikely rise to fame and the background for the music and musicians in the band. Also in 2015 a documentary, Born to Lose, about Uffe Lorenzen premiered, prominently featuring Spids Nøgenhat live and in the studio, during the recording of Kommer med fred. Born to Lose was shown at movie theatres all over Denmark and was well received among critics. In the film, Lorenzen explains that a major reason for Spids Nøgenhats revival and particularly the decision to do another album, was due to sound engineer, booker and close friend, Ralph A. Rjeiley. Rjeiley was known as a driving force for psychedelia and stoner rock in Copenhagen, from the early 1990s and into the 2000s, and besides from working with Spids Nøgenhat, he was one of their biggest fans. After recording En mærkelig kop te—an album that hardly anyone noticed at its release, but later gained cult status—the band slowed down, but he still kept pushing them to do one more. Ralph A. Rjeiley died of testicular cancer in 2012. Spids Nøgenhat has recorded and performed covers of Danish \\"golden age\\" rock by artists such as Hans Vinding, Young Flowers, Tømrerclaus and Røde Mor.

Incompetent and conceited, Wang Zhaoyuan was nevertheless well-trusted by the Later Shu emperor Meng Chang, with whom he was particularly close. About 2 months after he boasted that he would go on to conquer the Song \\"as easily as turning one's palms\\", he was captured by the Song army following successive defeats. The Later Shu fell a few days later. Early life Wang Zhaoyuan was from Chengdu, the capital of the Former Shu dynasty. Orphaned at an early age, he followed the Buddhist monk Zhiyin (智諲) and became a samanera when he was around 12 years old. The Former Shu was conquered by the Later Tang in 925, and in the following year general Meng Zhixiang arrived to assume governorship (jiedushi) of Xichuan (西川). One day, Meng Zhixiang hosted many monks in the city to a grand feast at his yamen, and Wang Zhaoyuan went with Zhiyin. At the banquet, his cleverness impressed Meng Zhixiang. Thus Wang Zhaoyuan became a personal servant to Meng Zhixiang's son Meng Chang (then called Meng Renzan), who had just started school. He and Meng Chang (several years his junior) became particularly close. Under the Later Shu Meng Zhixiang founded the Later Shu dynasty in 934, but died just a few months on the throne. He was succeeded by the 15-year-old Meng Chang, who made Wang Zhaoyuan the \\"Commissioner of Roll-Up Curtain\\" (卷簾使). Some time later Wang Zhaoyuan was made the \\"Commissioner of Tea and Wine Storage\\" (茶酒庫使). In 948, after putting grand councilor Zhang Ye to death over suspicions of treason, Meng Chang began to centralize power. After getting the ageing chief-of-staff (shumishi) Wang Chuhui retire, Wang Zhaoyuan along with Gao Yanzhao (高延昭) were made \\"Commissioners of Communications and Memorials\\" (通奏使) with positions in the Bureau of Military Affairs. It was said that Meng Chang discussed all important matters with them and allowed them free rein over the use of the national treasury, with nary a question asked. Wang Zhaojun was also given the governorship of Mei Prefecture and Yongping (永平, i.e. Qiong Prefecture). A few months later, he became the governor of Zhaowu (昭武, i.e. Li Prefecture). After more than a year, he became the governor of Kui Prefecture. Meng Chang's mother Empress Dowager Li had often told his son that Wang Zhaoyuan was not to be entrusted, but Meng Chang didn't heed her advice. He made Wang Zhaoyuan grand councilor and governor of Shannan West Circuit (山南西道), one of the 3 major circuits under Later Shu's control. When Wang Zhaoyuan returned to the imperial court in Chengdu to thank the emperor, he requested to be relieved of the \\"Commissioner of Communications and Memorials\\" post, and Meng Chang granted this request. The Song dynasty was founded in 960, replacing the Later Zhou dynasty as Later Shu's new northeastern neighbor. Fearful of Song's powerful military, Meng Chang wanted to establish diplomatic relations with them, but Wang Zhaoyuan adamantly opposed. Because he enjoyed reading about military theories, Wang Zhaoyuan often likened himself to Zhuge Liang, a brilliant 3rd-century strategist who also served a \\"Shu\\" dynasty (the Shu Han). Wang Zhaoyuan reasoned that because of several strategic natural barriers, the Later Shu was impenetrable to foreign invasion. He advised Meng Chang to form an alliance with the (militarily weak) Northern Han dynasty instead. In December 964, the Song dynasty finally began the long-planned invasion, with 60,000 soldiers. Meng Chang named Wang Zhaoyuan overall commander and asked grand councilor Li Hao to send off the troops from Chengdu. At the farewell banquet, Wang Zhaoyuan got drunk, and grabbing Li Hao's arm, he bragged: Trying to imitate Zhuge Liang, he had an iron hand fan in his hand. Once he arrived in Hanyuan, the Song force already took Jianmen Pass, the most strategic pass of the Roads to Shu. Wang Zhaoyuan was so frightened he could not speak properly. Bedridden and unable to get up, he handed military decisions over to his assistant Zhao Chongtao (趙崇韜). After Zhao Chongtao was defeated and captured, Wang Zhaoyuan threw away his armor and weapons and fled, eventually hiding himself in a peasant home. When he was captured, his eyes were swollen because he had been crying. He kept reciting a line from a poem by Luo Yin, which lamented Zhuge Liang's lack of success despite his mental genius: Under the Song dynasty After Later Shu's conquest, Emperor Taizu of Song forgave him and gave him official titles. He served as a diplomat to Đại Cồ Việt (Đinh dynasty) in the 970s.

He returned to competition 6 years later and won Plantation Lite-Shod World Championships with both Ray Gilmer and Dr. Jeanne Morrison. Life and career Cash for Keeps is a chestnut stallion foaled in 1991. He was bred by Bonnie Cady, and was sired by the World Grand Champion Coin's Hard Cash, out of the mare Pride's Georgia Peach. His maternal grandsire was Harlinsdale Farm's notable sire Pride of Midnight. Cash for Keeps was purchased by the Harrell Brawner family of Wynne, Arkansas in 1994 and initially trained by Sammy Day. Ridden by Day, he won the four-year-old preliminary class in the 1995 Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration and followed up by winning the World Championship for that age division. In 1997 the Brawners moved Cash for Keeps to Ray Gilmer's West Tennessee stable so he would be closer to their home. By 2000 Cash for Keeps had made several bids for the World Grand Championship, and the Brawners had publicly announced that if he did not win that year, they would retire him. When Cash for Keeps won, Gilmer had been training for 28 years and had never thought he would actually win the World Grand Championship. Following the World Grand Championship, Gilmer and Cash for Keeps made appearances at multiple horse shows across the Southeast and signed autographs at the Celebration Grounds. One year after his win, Cash for Keeps was formally retired in a ceremony at the 2001 Celebration. He wore his sire's horse blanket and was ridden by Gilmer to the song \\"Remember Me\\" from the Coyote Ugly movie soundtrack. At the end of the ceremony Gilmer dismounted, attached the reins to the saddle so they could not drag or catch Cash for Keeps' feet, and allowed the horse to exit the arena by himself. Gilmer and Falcon Ridge Farm purchased Cash for Keeps and stood him at stud for a few years following his retirement from showing. In late 2004 Cash for Keeps was sold to Morrison Stables, Hattiesburg, Mississippi. In 2006, five years after being retired and at the age of 15, Cash for Keeps entered the Celebration again and, ridden by Gilmer, won the Plantation Lite-Shod World Championship. It was the first time in Celebration history a horse had won a flat-shod World Championship after winning the World Grand Championship. Gilmer said after the win, \\"A great horse should be able to excel at any level of show ring competition. All the pads and action devices should do is enhance a horse's natural gait.\\" He also noted that he had wanted to show Cash for Keeps in a different division for several years to demonstrate the horse's ability.

However, except for hydropower, few renewable energy sources are utilized. One of the alternative sources of energy is wind energy. It is also more profitable due to the cost, ecological cleanness, and its renewable properties compared to other alternative energy sources. Azerbaijan's renewable energy sources are hydropower, wind, and solar and biomass power plants. Azerbaijan has 12 big and 7 small hydroelectric plants. It also has 6 wind, 10 solar, and 6 biomass power plants constructed from 2018 to 2020, which are expected to have an installed capacity of 420 megawatts (MW). The country's installed renewable energy capacity is 4.5 MW out of a total installed capacity of 6,452 MW. The technical potential for installed renewable electricity capacity is 115,200 MW for solar PV, 4,500 MW for wind, 1,500 MW for biomass, and 400 MW for small hydro. The government of Azerbaijan aims to increase share of renewables in total electricity production to 30% by 2030.  Renewable energy sources in Azerbaijan  Azerbaijan’s renewable energy sources are hydropower, wind, solar, and biomass power plants. Together, these generated 1.48 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy in 2018, comprising almost 9% of the total production of 17.2 billion kWh. = Windmills = Azerbaijan is one of those countries where windmills could be perfect fit due to geographical location. In particular, the Absheron peninsula, coastline of Caspian Sea and islands in the northwestern part of Caspian Sea, the Ganja-Dashkesan zone in the west of Azerbaijan and the Sharur-Julfa area of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic are favorable areas. In 1999, Japan's Tomen Company, together with the Azerbaijan Scientific Research Institute of Power Engineering and Energy, installed two towers with 30 and 40 meters in Absheron, average annual wind speed was determined to be 7.9-8.1 m/sec and feasibility study about the installation of windmills with a total capacity of 30 MWt had been prepared in Qobustan region. = Solar panels = Solar panel is also one of the most favorable sources in the world, and it is especially promising for sunny areas.

Thus, the amount of sunny hours is 2400–3200 hours in Azerbaijan during the year, this means that the amount of solar rays falling on the territory of Azerbaijan is superior compared other countries that can be estimated as one of the efficiency criteria for attracting investments in the use of solar energy. The development of utilization of solar energy can partly solve energy problems in several regions of Azerbaijan. = Water Energy = From ecological point of view, water is the purest energy in the world. The production of electricity from this source is being increased since 1990. The specific weight of production power of hydroelectric power plants is currently 17.8 percent in the total energy system of the Republic. There are wide opportunities for mastering hydropower resources that have not been used so far in the country. As a result of the construction of hydroelectric power plants, floodwater is regulated, electricity is ecologically produced, and new irrigation systems are created. The rivers in the territory of Azerbaijan are favorable for small hydropower stations. There was no connection between Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic's energy system and the main energy system of the Republic, that is why medium, small and micro hydroelectric power stations need to be set up in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. = Biomass = Biomass is also an alternative source of energy. There are following sources of biomass in Azerbaijan: industrial waste which has ability to burn, wastes from forestry and wood processing field, agricultural crops and organic compounding wastes, wastes of household and communal areas, wastes from polluted areas by oil and oil products. According to the research, most of the production of waste is composed of biomass products in all sectors of the economy. It is possible to obtain gas, liquid and solid biomass which are used in electricity generation from those biomass substances. Thus, more than 2.0 million tonnes of solid and industrial wastes were thrown to neutralization zones every year in Azerbaijan. Solid and industrial wastes processing can partially eliminate the difficulties of warming up of public buildings in Baku and major industrial cities of the country. The underground temperature is widely used in many countries in industry, agriculture, household and communal fields and in medicine. The territory of Azerbaijan is rich of thermal waters. They cover large areas such as the Greater and Lesser Caucasus Mountains, the Absheron peninsula, the Talysh mountain-slope zone, the Kura basin and territories around the Caspian Sea and Guba region. It is possible to cover part of thermal energy needs in household and other areas by utilizing thermal waters in the mentioned areas. = Thermal energy and hydroelectric power station = There is high potential of alternative energy sources in Azerbaijan, and perspectives on especially the creation of wind, solar, and small hydroelectric power stations: Thermal and Hydroelectric power stations are more important to cover Azerbaijan's energy needs. Statistical data shows that this amount changes between 0.01-0.05 percent on alternative and renewable energy sources.  State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources  The State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established by the Decree of the President of Azerbaijan dated February 1, 2013, for improving the management system in the field of alternative and renewable energy. The Charter of the State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources was approved by the Decree of the Head of State on February 1, 2013. According to the Regulation, the Agency is the central executive body that carries out state policy and its regulation and efficient use of it in the field of alternative and renewable energy in Azerbaijan, effective organization of activities on alternative and renewable energy sources, coordination of activities in this field and state control. The Agency participates in the formation of uniform state policy in the relevant area, provides for carrying out of this policy as well as the development of alternative and renewable energy, the creation of infrastructure, the application of alternative and renewable energy in the economy and social sectors, energy production on State Agency on Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources, to carry out of events related to energy consumption and energy efficiency.  Annual report  In 2014, 1480.0 million kWh of electricity was generated in the country by all renewable energy sources. This, according to estimated calculations, along with saving of 298,5 thousand tons of mazut or 429.2 million m3 of natural gas, prevents spreading to the atmosphere 919,400 tonnes or 763,900 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). In 2015, 1816.0 million kilowatt/hours of electricity was generated by all alternative and renewable energy sources (21.5 percent more than in the previous year), and 6315.3 percent of thermal energy (15.9 percent more than in the previous year). This has resulted on savings of 464.7 million m3 of natural gas on average and, prevents spreading to the atmosphere 827.2 thousand tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Calculated based on “ The method of calculating the amount of gases the thermal effect spreading to atmosphere” approved by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources dated 18.01.2006) According to collecting data from the preliminary official statistical and economic subjects, in 2016, 2,141.9 million kilowatt/hours electricity, or 9.3 percent of 23,073.9 million kilowatt/hours of electricity produced by the all sources in country were the total amount of alternative and renewable energy sources. Compared with the previous year, the total production of electricity amounted to 100.8%, and its production on The State Agency for Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources was 117.1%. 4212.4 Gcal of thermal energy was generated on the State Agency for Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources, which means an increase of 2.0% compared to the previous year. Efficient utilization of State Agency for Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources has resulted 548.7 million m3 of natural gas savings and, to prevent spreading to the atmosphere 976.7 thousand tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Calculated based on “The method of calculating the amount of gases the thermal effect spreading to atmosphere” approved by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources dated 18.01.2006)  See also  Natural Resources of Azerbaijan Energy in Azerbaijan  References  Natural resources Economy of Azerbaijan ","title":"Renewable energy in Azerbaijan"},{"id":"55967336","text":"Badge \\"Excellence in Socialist Competition of the People's Commissariat for Food Industry of the USSR\\" The Ministry of Food Industry (Minpisheprom; ) was a government ministry in the Soviet Union. History The People's Commissariat of Food Industry was established on 29 July 1934 by decree of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars USSR, which divided the People's Commissariat of Foreign and Internal Trade and the People's Commissariat of Internal Trade and the People's Commissariat of Food Industry. According to the Stalin Constitution of 1936 the People's Commissariat of Food Industry is a union-republic commissariat. In January 1939, the People's Commissariat of Food Industry was subdivided by a ukase of the Presidium Supreme Soviet USSR, into the People's Commissariat of Fish Industry, the People's Commissariat of Meat and Dairy Industry, and the People's Commissariat of Food Industry USSR. The People's Commissariat of Food Industry was charged with supervision of the baking and confectionery industry, the sugar, alcohol, and liqueur industries, the fats and perfume and cosmetic industries, end all other enterprises not transferred to the People's Commissariat of Meat and Dairy Industry or to the People's Commissariat of Fish Industry. On 15 March 1946, the People's Commissariat of Food Industry USSR became the Ministry of Food Industry USSR. The Ministry of Gustatory Industry USSR was organized by a ukase of 15 July 1946. Enterprises, sovkhozes, and organizations of the following industries were transferred to its jurisdiction from the Ministry of Food Industry USSR: alcoholic spirits, viniculture, liqueur-vodka, brewing, mineral water and non-alcoholic beverages, perfume and cosmetics, volatile oils, tea, tobacco and makhorka, and the sulfite—alcohol and hydrolysis industry. On 20 January 1949, the Ministry of Gustatory Industry USSR and the Ministry of Food Industry USSR were consolidated into the Ministry of Food Industry USSR. The Ministry was abolished in November 1985 with the creation of the State Agro-Industrial Committee, which took over the functions of the Ministry for Agriculture, the Ministry for Fruit and Vegetable Production, the Ministry for the Meat and Dairy Industry, the Ministry of the Food Industry and the Ministry for Rural Construction.

Sur le site du Musée d’Histoire Militaire.), was a French nobleman and soldier who lead royalist forces during the Siege of Lyon.  Early life  The Précy family, originally from Dauphiné, migrated to Burgundy in the sixteenth century following the outbreak of the Wars of Religion. Louis François was born on 14 January 1742 to François Perrin (d. 1748) and his wife Marguerite Marque de Farges (d. 1754). Louis was twelve years old when his mother died and was placed in the care of his uncle, an officer who agreed to take him into the regiment he commanded. Louis went to Valenciennes in 1755 where he learned the profession of a soldier in the Regiment of Picardy.  Military career  Précy was appointed to teach in 1756, and then made lieutenant in 1758. He was sixteen. He participated in the campaigns of GermanyLa guerre de Sept Ans (1756-1763) est un conflit majeur du XVIIIe siècle. Elle opposa l'Angleterre et la Prusse d'une part à la France, l'Autriche, la Russie, l'Espagne, la Suède, des princes allemands d'autre part. Le conflit a deux aspects principaux : l'affrontement entre la France et l'Angleterre sur les conquêtes coloniales et l'opposition entre la Prusse et l'Autriche. Le jeu des alliances en fit un conflit mondial. cf Dziembowski Edmond, « la guerre de Sept Ans (1756-1763) », ed. Perrin, 2015, 700p. from 1756 to 1762.

An ephemeral function since the Guard was dissolved on 29 May 1792. Précy retired to Semur-en-Brionnais. =Siege of Lyon= In Paris, during the spring of 1793, the Jacobins eliminated the Girondins, while in Lyon the moderates eliminated the Jacobins. The chief of these, Chalier, was guillotined on 16 July 1793. The Convention as a result declared Lyon a city in rebellion, and the decision was made to send an army commanded by François Christophe de Kellermann (replaced in September by François Amédée Doppet) to suppress the insurgency. A delegationBaleydier Alphonse, « Histoire politique et militaire du peuple de Lyon durant la révolution (1789-1795) ». Ed. I. Curmer, Paris, 1845, t. 1, 401 p.

He was chosen because the city officials knew him in 1787-1789, when his regiment was garrisoned in Lyon. Précy agreed, quite lucidly from the account of the members of the group who came to him and to whom he answered: > \\"Have you thought well about the consequences of a war against the > Convention? They who can dispose of so many resources against you? Have you > thought of the sacrifices of all kinds that you will have to make to support > an unequal struggle? What do you know of civil war?\\" Précy himself said of the difficulties encounteredLouis, comte de Précy. « Siège de Lyon. Sortie des Lyonnais et retraite du général Précy, racontées par lui-même ».

On the same day, Précy attempted a sortie with a cavalry squadron – the last remaining – and repulsed the Convention Army on the other side of the Mulatiere Bridge. But despite the remarkably fierce resistance of the city, Lyon was taken and the civil authorities capitulated on 9 October 1793. That morning Précy escaped with 1,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. Retreating through Vaize, he fled to Saint- Romain-de-Popey, then Sainte-Agathe-en-Donzy, with most of his force being slaughtered en route. In Lyon, repression led by Couthon, then Collot d'Herbois and Joseph Fouché was severe. The battlements were destroyed and the city was renamed Ville-Affranchie, meaning \\"freed community\\"; though it reassumed its original name in October 1794. General Précy remained hidden among peasants in Beaujolais and Forez until 20 January 1795, finally fleeing to Switzerland.  Exile  While first exiled in Turin, he met Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence, who conferred upon him the rank of maréchal de camp. He would later join him in Verona.. Précy returned to Switzerland and in following years rejoined royalist forces combating the Revolution, and involved himself in various actions aimed at promoting the return of the monarchy. General Précy met with a number of foreign diplomats and traveled to England in 1796, then Vienna, and back to Switzerland. He married on 25 May 1797 in Surce with Jeanne-Marie Chavanne, widow of Perrin de Noailly. Fleeing Switzerland on the approach of the army of the Directory in 1797, he migrated to Überlingen and then to Augsburg, which he departed after the defeat of the Russians. He then found himself in Bayreuth under the protection of the King of Prussia, but at the request of First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte (in fact Fouche)Extrait du rapport du 8 prairial an IX de Fouché aux consuls : Suit la liste des personnes visées (Précy est en second). Fouché précise « que le ministre des affaires étrangères français doit demander au ministre prussien l'arrestation ». cf. . he was arrested on 8 July 1801. After peace was negotiated with the United Kingdom in March 1802, Napoleon sought to pacify his relations with the Emigres. On 11 August 1802, Précy was released from prison and spent his final years exiled in Wolfenbüttel, Hamburg, and Altona. =Return= Hôtel de Précy in Semur-en-Brionnais By Imperial Decree on 30 November 1811, Précy was allowed to return to France, provided that he reside in Dijon. This return was facilitated on 10 June 1812. The couple enjoyed a quiet marriage and the birth of their daughter, and were later allowed to settle in Brionnais. The fall of the First Empire and the return of Louis XVIII led Précy to Paris to offer his services despite being 72 years old. He received a lieutenant-general's patent on 13 August 1814 and was appointed commander of the National Guard of Lyon. Précy took post and observed the weakness of the Guard but had little time to reform the body before the arrival of Napoleon in Cannes on 1 March 1814. Précy and the civil authorities intend to hinder Napoleon, but upon his arrival in Lyon he passed triumphantly across the Bridge of the Guillotière hailed by the troops of Lyon. When the Imperial Army occupied Paris, Précy was released under stipulation that he retire under supervision to Marcigny. Death After the definitive abdication of the Emperor, he did not receive a new command. Précy remained in Marcigny where he died on 25 August 1820. A monument to the memory of the Siege of Lyon was erected, and the administrators of the monument sent to the Countess of Précy a request for the transfer of the ashes of her husband to Lyon. She accepted and the transfer took place in late September 1821. In Lyon, a religious ceremony took place at St. John's Cathedral: > \\"The body was received at the entrance of the cathedral by gentlemen of the > Chapter of Saint John.

The quarantine was authorized under Washington state law and the area's boundaries are periodically reset by the state's Department of Agriculture. The quarantine was declared in the early 1980s to arrest the spread of the apple maggot into a portion of eastern Washington. History The Apple Maggot Quarantine Area was established to control the spread of the apple maggot (pictured) into a protected agricultural area of eastern Washington. The apple maggot, which is not indigenous to the Pacific Northwest, was discovered to have arrived in Washington in 1980. The quarantine was declared thereafter and is designed to protect Washington's core apple growing regions from infestation. The Washington State Department of Transportation installed 70 signs along highways around the state in 1985 to warn of the quarantine. Authority for the quarantine is codified under Title 17 of the Revised Code of Washington. =Purpose= Washington exported $718 million worth of apples in 2016, making apples the state's seventh largest export, and the apple has been declared the official state fruit. Almost two-thirds of all apples grown in the United States are produced in Washington. According to the Washington Apple Commission, the quality standards for Washington apples \\"are more stringent than grading standards used in any other growing region in the world\\". A mandatory inspection program requires apples, all of which are hand-picked, to meet this set of standards that, in some criteria factors, exceed those set by the United States Department of Agriculture. The state's Department of Agriculture has said that the apple maggot threatens \\"Washington's iconic apple industry, as well as many of our other fruit crops\\". The establishment of reproducing populations of the apple maggot within Washington would have a devastating impact on the state's apple industry resulting from the potential loss of export markets. Quarantine regulations =Quarantine extent, procedures, and efficacy= Each year, the Washington state Department of Agriculture deploys apple maggot traps to a selection of sites in the state with between 5,500 to 8,500 traps deployed annually. The traps are yellow paneled, adhesive traps baited with ammonium carbonate lures. The area surrounding locations which successfully trap apple maggots may be further studied by analyzing fruit in the area for the presence of apple maggot larvae and, ultimately, placed in the quarantine zone. In 2011, for instance, the trapping of 35 apple maggots at 23 locations in Chelan County resulted in a recommendation to extend the quarantine zone to the western part of that county. A map showing the approximate boundaries of the Apple Maggot Quarantine Area within the United States as of 2017. Areas in red are under quarantine by Washington state, areas in grey are those outside the state free from quarantine, and areas in green are those within Washington free from quarantine. The states of Oregon, California, Idaho, and Utah, all areas of the eastern United States, and all \\"foreign countries where apple maggot is established\\" have also been placed under quarantine by Washington. In addition to these areas, as of 2017, all or portions of the state's counties of Chelan, Clallam, Clark, Cowlitz, Grays Harbor, Island, Jefferson, King, Kitsap, Klickitat, Lewis, Lincoln, Mason, Pacific, Pierce, Snohomish, Spokane, Skagit, Skamania, Thurston, Wahkiakum, Whatcom, and Yakima, are also quarantined. Washington State University's Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center has cited the fact that \\"apple maggots have never been found in commercially packed fruit in the state\\" as evidence of the quarantine's efficacy. =Terms of the quarantine= There is a prohibition on transporting homegrown or foraged fruit from the quarantine zone into the pest free zone, except for fruit that has first been processed through canning, jarring, juicing, or drying. In addition, any yard waste from the quarantine zone must be disposed of within the zone and cannot be transported across its boundaries. Store-bought fruit is exempt from the quarantine as it is already subject to inspection by state authorities. In addition, under state law pest control officials can order property owners to spray with pesticides trees in which the apple maggot has been observed. Incidents In September 2020, a crate of apples brought by Washington governor Jay Inslee to Bridgeport and Malden following major wildfires was found to contain apple maggots. The apples were picked at the Washington Governor's Mansion in Olympia and distributed by the governor's office during an official visit. This was accidental and was meant to be a nice gesture from the governor and governor's mansion.

In 1944, when McIntyre left a four-year booking at the Hawaiian Room in New York's Hotel Lexington, Aloma formed his own band and took over the engagement. MGM booked him for two sessions in 1952, resulting in eight sides which were later compiled into an LP album. He first recorded for Columbia Records in August and September 1953, resulting in song appearing not only on U.S. Columbia, but on Japanese Columbia and Philips in the Netherlands. He was featured on the Ed Sullivan Show on June 19, 1960 in a segment in tribute to Hawaii's statehood. When Disney's Polynesian Village Resort opened Aloma was the bandleader. Aloma died on June 26, 1980. Style Aloma was accounted as a \\"typical\\" traditional Hawaiian singer, although he recorded tracks that were intended to appeal to currently popular tastes. His original band's instrumentation had more in common with the big band of the day than with traditional Hawaiian music. Nevertheless it was accounted to be smooth \\"island music\\" even though it also performed current American pop music. In addition to musicians, his touring band also employed young women as hula dancers. Billboard stated that \\"Hawaiian music at its best is expected\\" of Aloma, describing his music as authentic and charming. He composed more than 65 songs.

Biography Mostafa Khan lived in an era of much political upheaval. It was the era of the Russo-Iranian Wars of the 19th century, a period during which the Russians took the Caucasus territories of Iran. In 1804, the Russians, led by general Pavel Tsitsianov, had invaded and sacked the Iranian town of Ganja, murdered its khan and his son, and had thereby initiated the Russo-Iranian War of 1804-1813. Having \\"shown\\" what Russia is capable of in terms of power and might, Tsitsianov thereafter attempted to force the other khans into submission to Russia by intimidation and enticement. Promising \\"Russian protection\\" and the guarantee that the khans would remain in power in their domains, the khan of Karabakh, Ibrahim Khalil Khan signed an agreement with Tsitsianov on 26 May 1805. After the massacre in Ganja, Mostafa Khan asked the central government in Tehran for assistance, in order to prevent Tsitsianov's advance. The government responded by sending an army under general Pir-Qoli Khan Qajar. However, when the general had reached the Mughan plain, he found out that Mostafa Khan had entered negotiations with the Russians. Mostafa Khan hoped that the Russians would recognize a Shirvan Khanate \\"enlarged\\" to the boundaries of the Shirvanshah's of the Medieval era. Though Mostafa Khan was uncomfortable with Tsitsianov's proposal, the latter threatened that if he wouldn't agree with his terms, he would replace Mostafa with his younger brother (who was reportedly enthusiastic about it). Anyhow, the Russians invaded the khanate, and on 6 January 1806, Mostafa Khan was forced to submit. Mostafa Khan was allowed to administer the khanate, and had to give an annual tribute in gold rubles to the Russians. Furthermore, he had to send hostages to Tiflis (Tbilisi), which had recently been annexed and transformed into the \\"base\\" of the Russian Caucasus Viceroyalty. Lastly, he also had to provide food and accommodation for the Russian garrisons. After Tsitsianov was killed in Baku in 1806, Mostafa Khan repudiated his allegiance to the Russians, and re-submitted himself to the shah. Things changed when Aleksey Yermolov took office as the new Russian commander-in-chief in the Caucasus, in 1816. A staunch Russian imperialist, Yermolov was committed to bring the entire Caucasus under the Russian sway. He wanted to establish the Aras river as the border between Iran and Russia at all costs, and was therefore determined to conquer the last remaining khanates under Iranian rule; the Erivan Khanate and the Nakchivan Khanate. When Ismail, the khan of Shaki, died in 1819 without any heir, Yermolov annexed the entity. Realizing what was going to happen to himself, Mostafa Khan fled to mainland Iran in 1820 with his son; Yermolov did not waste any time to annex the Shirvan Khanate. Several years later, in violation of the Gulistan treaty (1813), the Russians invaded Iran's Erivan Khanate. This sparked the final bout of hostilities between the two; the Russo-Iranian War of 1826-1828. Crown prince Abbas Mirza led a full-scale attack in the summer of 1826 order to recover the Iranian territories that had been lost by the Gulistan treaty. The war started off well for the Iranians; they quickly recaptured Ganja, Shirvan and Shaki amongst others, and performed attacks on Tiflis. The government then reinstated Mostafa in Shirvan. However, just a few months later, the tide had completely turned with the Iranian army suffering decisive defeats against the militarily superior Russians. In September 1826, Abbas Mirza was defeated at Ganja by Ivan Paskevich, and thus the army had to retreat over the Aras. Mostafa Khan, accompanied by a small retinue, fled once again to mainland Iran.

C. Edwards. The Invisible Girl is a Gothic tale written by Mary Shelley and first published in The Keepsake for 1833. The tale is set in Wales, and tells the story of a young woman named Rosina, who lives with her guardian, Sir Peter Vernon, and is secretly engaged to his son, Henry. Henry is away from home when their relationship is discovered, and Sir Peter casts Rosina out of the house. Sir Peter regrets his harshness and searches for her, but assumes she is dead when she cannot be found. Henry returns home to the news of Rosina's death and is heartbroken. He joins the search for her body, and the villagers tell him about the Invisible Girl, a ghostly figure who wanders the woods at night. Henry finds Rosina hiding in a remote ruin and discovers that she is really the Invisible Girl. Sir Peter forgives them for their secret engagement, and they are married.  Summary  The narrator tells the story of how he became lost during a walk along the coast of Wales and sought shelter in what looked like a ruined tower, thanks to the hospitality of its housekeeper. He is surprised at the comfortable furnishings within the tower, and is intrigued by a painting of a lovely young woman hung above the fireplace, entitled The Invisible Girl. The housekeeper tells him the following story. Many years before, a distraught man had arrived in the area looking for sailors to take him to a town about 15 miles away. The villagers recognized him as Henry Vernon, the son of Sir Peter Vernon, whose family owned an estate not far from the town Henry was headed to. The weather was uncertain, but two sailors accepted Henry's generous terms and agreed to take him to his destination. On the way, they were caught in a storm, and barely made it to shore before their boat crashed on some rocks, thanks to the guidance of a faint light in a nearby tower. They sought shelter in the tower, but it was uninhabited. The sailors tell Henry that the tower is the home of a ghost named the Invisible Girl, who is often seen at night wandering the shore in search of her lost lover. The three men spend the night in the tower, but Henry is too miserable to sleep, consumed by grief for his own lost love. Henry was secretly engaged to a young woman named Rosina, an orphan and a ward of his family. They grew up together and were very much in love, but Henry knew his father would not approve his marriage to a poor orphan, and so convinced Rosina to keep the engagement secret. They were happy for a while, since Sir Peter's blindness made it easy for them to conceal their relationship from him. But Sir Peter's recently widowed sister Mrs. Bainbridge arrived to live with them, and she suspected the affair. She convinced her brother to send Henry away and marry off Rosina in his absence. When Rosina refused to marry another, their engagement was discovered, and although Sir Peter loved his son and Rosina, he was angry at their deception. Spurred on by the spiteful Mrs. Bainbridge, he banished Rosina from his house. She left that night, but her absence was not discovered until the morning, and she could not be found. Sir Peter searched desperately for her, bitterly regretting his cruelty and furious at his sister for inciting his anger so unjustly. When Rosina cannot be found, they assume she drowned in a nearby river. They retire to a different estate and send word to Henry of Rosina's death. Henry rushes home only to discover that her body has not been recovered, and determines to journey back to Wales to recover it himself. This is why he has hired the sailors to take him to his family's estate on the coast of Wales. In the morning, Henry and the two sailors seek food and provisions at a nearby fisherman's cottage. They ask about the legend of the Invisible Girl, but the fisherman's family have nothing to tell them. Henry returns to search the tower while his companions repair their boat, but finds no sign of habitation other than a single lady's shoe. The shoe reminds him of Rosina, and he determines to return it to its owner. The three men arrange to sleep at the fisherman's cottage, but Henry cannot sleep, and is surprised to see a light in the tower. He returns there, planning to surprise the inhabitant and return the shoe. The inhabitant flees as soon as he enters, but he explains his purpose, and is astounded to hear Rosina's voice reply. The lovers are overjoyed to be reunited, and Rosina tells Henry that she took shelter in the tower after her banishment from the Vernon estate, and is still terrified of Sir Peter and his curses upon them. Henry tells her of his father's change of heart, and after a few months of recovery, she and Henry are married. They furnished the tower and hung the painting of Rosina to remember her sad persecution and the story of their happy reunion.  Publication History  \\"The Invisible Girl\\" was first published in The Keepsake for 1833, a British literary annual. It was accompanied by an engraved illustration entitled Rosina, which was painted by William Boxall and engraved by J. C. Edwards. It was reprinted in a few anthologies, but is largely unread and unstudied.  Themes and Influences  \\"The Invisible Girl\\" is one of several Gothic tales that Mary Shelley published in The Keepsake. Others include \\"Ferdinando Eboli\\" (1829), \\"The Evil Eye\\" (1830), \\"Transformation\\" (1831), \\"The Dream\\" (1833), and \\"The Mortal Immortal\\" (1834). Although the tale does not involve real supernatural phenomena, it includes a number of motifs characteristic of Gothic fiction, including a tyrannical guardian, a persecuted heroine, and a ghost story. It employs the technique of the explained supernatural characteristic of Ann Radcliffe. Like several other works by Shelley, including Frankenstein, \\"The Invisible Girl\\" employs a frame narrative. In terms of form, \\"The Invisible Girl\\" is a variation on the Gothic fragment, exemplified by Anna Letitia Aiken's \\"Sir Bertrand: A Fragment\\" (1773). Although it is often categorized as a short story, that form was not named until the 1880s in Britain. It is more accurately classified as a Gothic tale, a story about an experience of the strange or supernatural, often narrated in the first or third person.

Sponsors were the Vote Power League, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and numerous smaller organizations. The protest was not provoked by a specific incident, but was intended “to show their frustration with the nation’s unfair political, social, and economic systems.” Another scholar described the root causes as “discrimination, proscription, and segregation.” A more extensive statement from the same scholar says the “major grievances... included deplorable housing conditions, economic exploitation, bleak employment prospects, racial discrimination, poor police-community relations, and economic competition with Cuban refugees.” The date was chosen to coincide (because of the publicity opportunity) with the Republican National Convention being held in Miami Beach. Events =Outbreak= After a white reporter was forcibly ejected from the “Blacks Only” rally, Miami police responded with five cars and a carbine unit, which exacerbated tensions. A white man in a car brandishing a “Wallace for President” bumper sticker attempted to drive through the vicinity. As he passed the Vote Power building, his automobile was met with a barrage of stones and bottles and crashed into another car. The driver fled on foot, and his car was overturned and set on fire. Vandals ransacked white-owned businesses in Liberty City’s commercial district. Police eventually quelled the outbreak with tear gas. =Meetings and escalation= Florida governor Claude Kirk and SCLC president Ralph Abernathy, both attending the Republican National Convention, and Metro-Dade County mayor Chuck Hall arrived and held a meeting with community spokesmen. No actions to resolve the black communities’ issues were agreed on. The Governor suggested that they continue the discussion at 11 AM the following morning. When, the following day, Kirk and local authorities only sent emissaries and did not appear themselves, larger-scale violence broke out. Rioters stoned police, fire-bombed area markets, and looted white-owned shops. Miami officials requested assistance from the Florida Highway Patrol, which used a cloud of tear gas dispensed by a modified version of an insect-control machine to restore order. That afternoon Miami police, responding to what they thought was sniper fire, killed two residents and left a fourteen-year-old boy with a bullet through his chest.

Yang Zaixing (, died 21 August 1140) was a Song dynasty general under Yue Fei, known for his ferocity in battles. He fought against the Jin dynasty in the Jin–Song Wars. His heroic death in the battle of Yancheng—where he led 300 cavalry to kill an estimated 2000 enemies before succumbing to hundreds of arrows piercing his body—made him a legendary figure still remembered today.

The town would expand further with the opening of Mine No. 2 in 1907, about a half mile to the south of the town. In 1914, the Enterprise Coal Company was ranked as one of the top 24 coal producers in the state. The vein would eventually run dry, and in 1919 Enterprise would be shut down as a coal mining town.

His father, Petru Cercel, was Prince of Wallachia in the 1580s, and alleged son of Pătrașcu the Good. This probably meant that Marcu was a nephew of Michael the Brave, who in 1599–1601 managed to control Wallachia, Moldavia, and the Principality of Transylvania, making Marcu his representative or regional co-ruler. It is not precisely known who Marcu's mother was, but she was likely Turkish and related to the Köprülüs; she may be the same as Lady Stanca, who went on to marry Aaron the Tyrant, also Prince of Moldavia. Marcu had his first military engagements in the 1600 war for Moldavia, when he was chased out by the Polish army. He fled to Transylvania before 1601, and, after Michael the Brave's killing, rallied with the Holy Roman Empire, which was fighting a Long War against the Ottoman Empire. By 1602, he was given a small command function in the Imperial Army, under Giorgio Basta, and saw action at Teișani, helping to defeat the Crimean Tatars. He then renounced plans to obtain the Wallachian throne, ceding it to another Habsburg favorite, Radu Șerban. His subsequent attempts to invade Moldavia from Transylvania were curbed by the Bocskai uprising, during which he also lost control over his Transylvanian estates. He lived for several years in Austrian Bohemia at the court of Sigismund Báthory. In the 1610s, Cercel switched allegiances and became a favorite of Gabriel Bethlen; this rebel Prince of Transylvania also recommended him to the Ottomans. His final bid for the Moldavian throne ended in 1618, when Cercel settled in Transylvania. He lived to see the Bohemian Revolt and the Thirty Years' War, acting as Bethlen's agent in Prague. He was rewarded for results achieved during this mission, emerging as the owner of Dezna estate. He was twice married, the second time to Druzsina Bogáthy, who survived his death. Biography =Origins and childhood= Marcu was born at a time when Wallachia and Moldavia, the two Danubian Principalities, were tributary states of the Ottoman Empire, which had a growing influence on the appointment of local rulers. As a pretender, he traced his lineage to the ancient House of Basarab, through the branch known as Drăculești. This hinges on the claim of Pătrașcu the Good, his paternal grandfather, to have been the son of Radu Paisie. A Prince Marco, or Marcu, was Paisie's son and co-ruler. A letter from this \\"Io Marco voevod\\", although dated 1542,Nicolaescu, pp. 76–77 was read by historian Nicolae Iorga as a possible reference to the much younger Cercel.Iorga (1898), pp. 266–267 It is unclear what became of this historical figure: some authors hypothesize that he embraced Islam upon Paisie's downfall; others believe that he was in fact the same person as Pătrașcu.Valentin Gheonea, \\"Un domnitor controversat — Radu Paisie\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1996, p. 51 On at least occasion, Petru Cercel referred to himself as a grandson of Radu Paisie.Pascu, p. 12 Among Pătrașcu's legitimate children, the first one to rule Wallachia was a Vintilă, who took the throne for only a few days in 1574.Nicolaescu, pp. 297, 300; Pascu, pp. 84–86; Stănilă, p. 4 He and Petru Cercel were likely full brothers, both of them born to Pătrașcu's wife Voica,Stănilă, pp. 4–5 although scholar Ștefan Pascu argues that only Petru was Voica's son.Pascu, pp. 12–14, 84 The more famous Michael the Brave is widely believed to have been born from Prince Pătrașcu's marriage or affair with Teodora, making him Petru Cercel's half- brother and Marcu Cercel's uncle.Gane, pp. 106–107, 138–140; Nicolaescu, pp. 294, 297–301 This was backed by Michael himself, who in 1594 referred to Petru as \\"My Highness' brother\\".Pascu, pp. 86–87 However, at least one account in English diplomatic records disputes Petru's background, alleging that, rather than Pătrașcu's son, he was a Greek from Morea.Robert Mantran, \\"Comptes rendus. L'Europe centrale à l'époque moderne. Documents sur les principautés roumaines. E. D. Tappe, Documents Concerning Rumanian History (1427–1601), Collected from British Archives\\", in Annales. Économies, Sociétés, Civilisations, Vol. 23, Issue 5, 1968, p. 1172 Petru, who took the Wallachian throne in July 1583, had at least three sons, of whom Marcu is the best known. According to the eyewitness Franco Sivori of Genoa, all were born in 1583 from different mothers, none of whom was probably married to the Prince. Sivori claims that Marcu was the first-born, followed by Jonas or Ionașcu and Radulo or Radu (later re-baptized Petru).Pascu, pp. 76–77, 90, 94–98, 251, 276; Rădulescu, pp. 50–51, 54, 55. See also Birtz, pp. 67–68; Stănilă, p. 6 The latter is also attested in other documents, primarily as a bookish intellectual.Birtz, p. 68; Pascu, pp. 96–97; Rădulescu, p. 54 Iorga and fellow historian Stoica Nicolaescu also list Marcu as having two brothers, but name them as Dumitrașco and Ștefan.Iorga (1902), pp. IV, XXXVI, XLIV; Nicolaescu, p. 300; Pascu, p. 90 Other scholars either dismiss both as impostorsPascu, pp. 89–90; Rădulescu, p. 54 or view them as additional sons.Stănilă, p. 6 Another disputed detail in Sivori is the date of birth. The chronicler Ciro Spontone similarly notes that Marcu was aged eighteen in September 1601,Rădulescu, p. 57 an account also backed by historian Constantin Rezachevici.Pascu, pp. 91–92; Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 Other scholarship, however, concludes that Marcu was probably born before his father's coronation.Rădulescu, pp. 54–55 Prince Petru was a pious Christian. He may have embraced Catholicism by 1581,Stănilă, p. 7 or at least announced that he would, for opportunistic reasons.Pascu, pp. 21, 44–45, 53–55, 75, 142 Some historians describe him as a Catholic committed to Counter-Reformation ideology, though one who also respected and protected the majority Wallachian Orthodox Church.Luca, pp. 93–94 Others see Petru as an Orthodox who remained friendly toward Catholicism and had Protestant missionaries burned at the stake.Birtz, pp. 63–67 His behavior was otherwise incompatible with either Catholic or Orthodox norms. Ottoman sources of the period suggest that he was a polygamist, keeping three mistresses, all of whom were Turkish and Muslim apostates; this would also make Marcu, and possibly his two brothers as well, half-Turkish.Rădulescu, p. 52; Stănilă, pp. 5, 11 As described by Rezachevici, Marcu was \\"the son of Petru Cercel and of a (baptized) Turkish wife, Sultana\\".Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 One report of the period backs this account, describing Marcu as a \\"son\\" of the Köprülü family, therefore also Turko-Albanian.Rădulescu, pp. 52, 60. See also Iorga (1902), p. CXXXIII; Stănilă, p. 5 Petru Cercel may have also had an official wife, whose name is recorded as \\"Stanca\\", and who is sometimes identified as Marcu's mother. Whether or not she was another name for Sultana, or another Turkish wife, or simply Marcu's stepmother is uncertain, but all are viewed by historians as likely hypotheses.Pascu, pp. 87–88; Rădulescu, pp. 52–53; Stănilă, p. 5 Prince Petru in Târgoviște's Princely Church (1690s fresco) Iorga proposes that Marcu was named after Prince Marko, a semi- legendary hero of the anti-Ottoman struggle \\"for Christendom\\".Iorga (1934), p. 78 His other name was his father's cognomen, meaning \\"Earring\\"—from Petru's distinguishing accessory.Alexandru Graur, Nume de persoane, p. 70. Bucharest: Editura științifică, 1965. According to historian Maria-Venera Rădulescu, the heir-apparent must have spent his early years at the princely court in Târgoviște. She believes that a connected site in Cerbureni may preserve Marcu's only known portrait, done in terracotta by Italian artisans, and showing him as a young child.Rădulescu, passim Marcu's first-ever mention is as a ktitor, or restorer, of Târgoviște's Princely Church, which was in fact a project of his father's.Pascu, p. 43 Rădulescu also distinguishes clues that Petru may have wanted his son to acquire a classical education.Rădulescu, pp. 54–55, 62 From his father, he received a manuscript of the Gospels, copied by Radu Grămăticul when he was in exile with Pătrașcu's family.Luca, p. 94; Pascu, pp. 84–85, 94 A ledger at the Pontifical Greek College of Saint Athanasius in Rome suggests that a Marco Baiboda di Blachia (\\"Marco Voivode of Wallachia\\") was enlisted there in 1585, but also that he left soon after, refusing to take the pledge.I. Radu, \\"Foștii elevi români-uniți ai școalelor din Roma\\", in Observatorul. Revistă Documentară Culturală–Socială–Religioasă, Vol. II, Issues 5–6, September–October 1929, p. 274 =Orphan \\"princelet\\"= This period of his life ended later in 1585. The allegations surrounding Petru Cercel's amorous life and encouragement of apostasy produced a fatwa, and played a significant part in Sultan Murad III decision to shun his vassal.Rădulescu, p. 52; Stănilă, p. 11 All known sons became outcast claimants following their father's removal. Petru Sr fled into the Principality of Transylvania, but was imprisoned there by Ottoman loyalists, and moved to the fortress of Huszth. Sivori notes that Marcu and Jonas followed their father, who obtained clemency for them. They subsequently joined the retinue of Ferenc II, the Count Kendi, who regarded them as \\"his own sons\\" and granted them domicile in Dátos (Dătășeni).Rădulescu, pp. 51, 53–54, 55. See also Pascu, pp. 90–91, 94–95, 251 Also according to Sivori, Marcu's brother Radu Petru was living in Istanbul as a protege of the French ambassadors.Birtz, p. 67; Pascu, pp. 90–91, 95; Rădulescu, p. 51 It is also certain that Stanca went on to remarry Aaron the Tyrant, who became Prince of Moldavia in 1591.Pascu, pp. 88, 91; Rădulescu, pp. 52–53, 55, 60 Pope Sixtus V obtained Prince Petru's release, allowing him to seek asylum in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.Birtz, pp. 61, 67; Pascu, pp. 75–77; Rădulescu, pp. 53–54 He also bribed the Ottoman authorities and arranged for his sons to still be recognized as valid candidates for the Wallachian throne.Rădulescu, pp. 53–54 He then offered Jonas and Marcu as hostages to Poland, but escaped from prison as this offer was still being assessed.Pascu, pp. 76–77, 90 Still living at Dátos, Marcu received a multilingual education, being taught to read and write in New Latin, Hungarian, and German.Pascu, pp. 90–91, 94–95; Rădulescu, p. 55 From March 1590, when Petru Cercel was killed at sea by the Ottomans,Birtz, pp. 61–62, 67; Gane, pp. 111–112; Nicolaescu, p. 300; Pascu, pp. 82–83; Stănilă, pp. 11–12 Marcu became his theoretical successor. Those years witnessed his uncle Michael the Brave's ascent through the ranks of Wallachian boyardom, and, in late 1593, his seizure of the Wallachian throne. In 1597, following Prince Aaron's death, Marcu and his (step)mother Stanca were reunited.Pascu, p. 91; Rădulescu, p. 55 They returned to Wallachia, possibly alongside Jonas, and were received at Michael's court.Andreescu, p. 56; Pascu, p. 91; Rădulescu, p. 55 Spontone claims that Michael virtually adopted Marcu and intended to make him his son-in-law.Rădulescu, pp. 55–56 By 1598, however, Cercel had promised to marry Gerolama, an Ottoman slave girl and niece of Agha Ömer, the influential eunuch.Pedani, pp. 72–73 Michael's anti-Ottoman rebellion, and his entry into the Long Turkish War as an ally of the Holy Roman Empire, also resulted in Wallachia's conquest of Transylvania (October 1599). Marcu's engagement to Gerolama ended abruptly, though he had already collected her dowry, making him a personal enemy of Ömer.Pedani, p. 73 His own career peaked in May 1600, with Michael's conquest of Moldavia. One report by the English Ambassador Henry Lello, written in March 1599, suggests that Marco may have been groomed to take over in Moldavia even before its conquest. The text notes that Michael wanted to secure Moldavia as a link with the Tsardom of Russia, having been promised 12,000 Don Cossacks.Andreescu, pp. 55–56 Shortly before embarking on the expedition, Michael was holding peace talks with the Ottomans. The titular Prince of Moldavia, Ieremia Movilă, observed these from a distance, concluding that Michael wanted him toppled. Also according to Ieremia, Michael's candidate was a \\"Greek relative of his\\", which, Rezachevici notes, was a false label for Cercel.Rezachevici (1979), p. 1333 During the same months, Michael also offered the Moldavian throne to a Ștefan Bogdan Sasul, orphaned son of Prince Iancu Sasul.Iorga (1898), p. 254 After renouncing other plans to make his own son, Nicolae Pătrașcu, ruler of that country, Michael finally sent Marcu to Iași, preparing him for his coronation.Rădulescu, p. 56; Rezachevici (2000), pp. 5, 8–11 A regency council was eventually appointed, generally believed to have comprised Andronikos Kantakouzenos, Hetman Udrea Băleanu, Spatharios Negrea, and Armaș Sava.Lupaș, p. 178; Rădulescu, p. 56. See also Rezachevici (1979), p. 1343 & (2000), p. 10 Several sources mention Marcu as a reigning Prince, before Ieremia could return with Polish backing—one of several Polish interventions in the region. According to Rezachevici, Michael's regime should be regarded as a dynastic union: Nicolae Pătrașcu was the Prince of Wallachia, Cercel ruled over Moldavia, while Michael was the claimant Prince of Transylvania and \\"higher point of reference\\" for the other two.Rezachevici (2000), pp. 5, 10 The 18th- century record, Letopisețul Cantacuzinesc, argues that Marcu and Preda Buzescu arrived in Iași \\"and began to make merry\\" before being chased out by Ieremia; \\"and as happy as they were on their arriving, so were they ashamed to run back\\".Rădulescu, p. 56. See also Lupaș, p. 178; Pascu, pp. 91–92; Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 A Moldavian writer, Miron Costin, notes that Marcu, or Marcul vodă, was \\"princelet\\" for \\"a short while\\", but also that his reign was entirely omitted in the succession lists.Rădulescu, p. 56; Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 Moldavian aurochs and the Wallachian bird Rezachevici calculates the end dates of Marcu's reign as July 23 and September 4, 1600.Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 Before being chased out of the country, he may have organized efforts to resist the Poles. An 18th-century author, Johann Filstich, records that Marcu commanded some of the Moldavian military forces, but was easily defeated by Stanisław Żółkiewski.Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 This struggle may also have involved a Ragusan mercenary, Deli-Marko (Delmarco),Rezachevici (1979), p. 1342 with whom the Prince is sometimes confused (for instance, in the works of Ilie Bărbulescu).Al. Grecu, \\"Relațiile Țării Românești și ale Moldovei cu Raguza \\", in Studii. Revistă de Istorie și Filosofie, Vol. 2, Issue IV, October–December 1949, p. 116 Some Ottoman sources of the period also refer to Cercel as Deli-Marco, translated by Iorga as \\"Marco the Brave\\".Iorga (1902), p. CXV =Habsburg ally= The Poles also drove away Nicolae Pătrașcu from his throne in Wallachia, replacing him with Simion Movilă. In Transylvania, Michael's regime was destabilized by a revolt of the Hungarian nobility, which won backing from the Imperial general Giorgio Basta (see Battle of Mirăslău). Michael briefly reconciled with Basta, but was eventually assassinated by the latter at Câmpia Turzii, in September 1601. Marcu split with Michael's family and rallied with Basta, joining his quarters at Făgăraș Citadel. Basta's letters confirm his presence there on September 5, and also note that a delegation of Wallachian boyars wanted Marcu to become their Prince. This request appears to have been challenged by other boyars, who obtained recognition for a more experienced candidate, the former Paharnic Radu Șerban.Pascu, p. 92; Rădulescu, p. 57 During the interregnum, the Cercel brothers also became rivals: a son of Petru Cercel, identified by Pascu as being Radu Petru, was a Polish favorite for the Wallachian throne.Pascu, p. 95 Dumitrașco and Ștefan, who claimed to be Cercel's other sons, also made unsuccessful bids to the throne in that interval.Iorga (1902), pp. IV, XXXVI, XLIV; Pascu, pp. 89–90; Rădulescu, p. 54 The former was at the Polish court, competing for favors with Prince Simion, while Ștefan operated in Wallachia and among the outlaws of Temeşvar Eyalet.Iorga (1902), pp. IV, XXXVI, XLIV; Pascu, pp. 89–90 By 1602, Marcu had turned his attention back on Moldavia. This implied using a heraldic seal with the Moldavian aurochs and the Wallachian bird, on Hungarian-language letters which he signed as Marko vaijvoda Moldvania (in Latin: Marcus Vayvoda C.czel).Rădulescu, pp. 58–59, 65 In March of that year, Polish King Sigismund Vasa received reports that Cercel was gathering a 10,000-strong army of Serb and Wallachian mercenaries, with which he planned to retake Iași.Pascu, p. 92; Rădulescu, p. 57 That April, he was with Basta and Radu Șerban at Sathmar. A delegation of Moldavian boyars, frightened by Ieremia's violent purges, asked Basta to recognize Marcu as their Prince. Their petition was endorsed by Radu Șerban, who thus expected to rid himself of Marcu.Pascu, p. 92; Rădulescu, pp. 57–58 By May, Marcu had gathered 10,000 men for his planned expedition.Iorga (1902), p. XVI Nevertheless, in June, a \\"Marchiò of Bogdania\\" was allegedly lodging in Istanbul with Ambassador Lello. As argued by Iorga, this account cannot refer to Cercel, but rather to his Moldavian rival, Ștefan Bogdan.Iorga (1898), p. 255 By September 1602, Marcu was known to be camped with the Imperial Army at Corona, where Radu Șerban was preparing the reconquest of Wallachia. Marcu assisted in this effort, commanding a guard unit of 3,000 Székelys and 1,000 Transylvanian pikemen.Iorga (1902), pp. XVIII–XIX; Rădulescu, p. 58 His troops defended Teișani from the Crimean Tatars, alongside forces led by Basta, Prince Radu and Stroe Buzescu.Iorga (1902), pp. XIX–XXI Finally, in January 1603, he led his force into Moldavia. Emperor Rudolf II received a letter from Prince Ieremia, who complained that Rudolf's Wallachian ally was causing damages across the border.Rădulescu, p. 58. See also Pascu, p. 92 Basta praised his skill in directing hajduk raids, during which Cercel collected various bounties, but in the end ordered him to return, fearing Polish reprisals.Iorga (1902), pp. VI, XVI From 1604, Marcu was faced with the Bocskai uprising in Transylvania, which cut him off from Moldavia. He was stranded at Libochowitz, in Austrian Bohemia, a pensioner of the Aulic Council and member of Sigismund Báthory's retinue.Pascu, p. 93; Rădulescu, pp. 58–59 In 1606, he was with Basta and Galeotto Barbiano di Belgiojoso at Cassovia, trying to uproot the Transylvanian occupation of that city.Iorga (1902), p. LXX By 1608, Marcu was in Prague, and, Iorga notes, was regarded as a \\"second Michael\\".Iorga (1902), p. LXX He was also poised to take the Moldavian throne from Constantin Movilă, but Radu Șerban intervened before this could happen, and put up Mihail Movilă on the throne.Iorga (1902), pp. LXX–LXXII Marcu's estranged cousin and competitor, Nicolae Pătrașcu, also settled in the Habsburg lands, but not before attempting to seize Wallachia from Radu Șerban. He was reportedly captured and mutilated during the events.Gane, pp. 210–211 Of Marcu's other surviving relatives, Stanca Cercel was Radu Șerban's guest in Wallachia—Matthias of Austria tried to arrange a safe conduct for Marcu's servants to meet with her.Rădulescu, p. 58 Meanwhile, the eponymous rebel leader, Stephen Bocskai, was proclaimed Prince of Transylvania and confiscated all of Marcu's assets, including an estate at Alsóidecs (Ideciu).Pascu, p. 93; Rădulescu, p. 58 In May 1607, a new Prince, Sigismund Rákóczi, also confiscated Cercel's townhouse in Feyérvár (Bălgrad).Rădulescu, p. 58 According to Iorga, this meant that Cercel was living in misery.Iorga (1934), p. 80 Rudolf considered him for a Captaincy of the Hungarian Kingdom, but none were yet available.Pascu, p. 93 =With Bethlen= Mockup of Cercel's castle in Dezna, from a 2018 display In February 1610, Rudolf ordered Marcu's arrest, having been informed that the Wallachian was involved in a conspiracy. This plot would have made Báthory King of Hungary and place the rump kingdom, alongside Transylvania, in the Ottoman camp.Pascu, p. 93; Rădulescu, p. 59 Released in March, after undergoing interrogations, Marcu was financially destitute. In July, he petitioned György Thurzó, the Hungarian Palatine, listing his services to the Hungarian nation and demanding to be granted an administrative office, with pay.Pascu, p. 93; Rădulescu, p. 59 His request was left unanswered in 1612, when he addressed new complaints to Matthias, who had since been crowned Emperor.Rădulescu, p. 59 In early 1613, he was involved again on the front against Báthory, asking Matthias to make him commander of the loyalist Transylvanian corps, which had been left leaderless by the death of Lajos Rákóczi.Pascu, p. 93; Dragoș Lucian Țigău, \\"Between Ephemeralty and Fiction. Addenda to the History of the Bans of Caransebeș and Lugoj\\", in Banatica, Vol. 26, Part II, 2016, p. 360 Taking over as Prince of Transylvania in October, Gabriel Bethlen informed his Ottoman allies that Matthias wanted Cercel to take the Moldavian crown. According to Bethlen, this was a conspiracy also involving Radu Șerban and Gáspár Bekes.Iorga (1902), p. CXV Nevertheless, the records of Schäßburg show that Marcu was bribing the Ottoman envoy Iskender Pasha and his son, hoping to obtain their goodwill.Iorga (1902), pp. CXIV–CXV In 1616, during a new war in Moldavia, he joined Bethlen's mercenary squads.Pascu, p. 93 This marked the beginning of Marcu's push into the new anti-Habsburg camp, consolidated by Bethlen. Marcu moved to Transylvania with his mother, his wife (who was dead by 1618), and a daughter.Iorga (1902), p. CXXXIII; Rădulescu, pp. 60, 61 In 1617, Bethlen officially presented him as his choice for Prince in either Moldavia or Wallachia, and expressed hopes that the Ottomans would endorse him.Iorga (1902), pp. CXXXI, CXXXIII–CXXXIV, CXXXLX, CXL; Pascu, p. 93; Rădulescu, pp. 59–60 The following year, with Bethlen's tacit support, Lupu Mehedințeanu staged a rebellion against Wallachia's Alexander IV. This presented an opportunity for Cercel, but Bethlen hesitated between him and Simion's son, Gabriel Movilă.Constantin Rezachevici, \\"Fenomene de criză social-politică în Țara Românească în veacul al XVII-lea\\", in Studii și Materiale de Istorie Medie, Vol. IX, 1978, pp. 68–69 Also in 1618, Marcu traveled to Istanbul, where he hoped to obtain the favors of Osman II against the same Movilă. His family situation and issues concerning his estate finally drove him back to Transylvania.Rădulescu, p. 60. See also Iorga (1902), pp. CXXXIII, CXL By 1619, Bethlen's involvement in the Thirty Years' War had pushed him back into political life. Various reports note that Cercel managed Transylvanian and Ottoman participation in the Bohemian Revolt. According to István Szamosközy, Marcu arrived in Prague as early as July 1618, and even obtained from the rebels promises that they would make Bethlen ruler of the Czech lands.Lupaș, p. 203 In discussions with Marcu, the Prince of Thurn pledged 100,000 scudi to the Transylvanians, in exchange for their opening a new front against the Habsburgs.Rădulescu, p. 60 Instead, imperials counted on support from two deposed Wallachian Princes. Now allies, Nicolae Pătrașcu and Radu Șerban similarly negotiated payment for a Polish intervention against Transylvania.Carl Göllner, \\"Beziehungen der Rumanischen Wojewoden Radu Șerban, Nicolae Petrașcu und Gaspar Graziani zur Milice chrétienne\\", in Revue des Études Sud-est Européennes, Vol. VI, Issue 1, 1968, pp. 80–83 Cercel's services were rewarded by Bethlen: in August 1619, Marcu received the citadel and estate of Dezna, in Zaránd County; in October, while he was still away, Stanca was granted provisional ownership of Sóspatak (Șeușa) by its lord, the Canon Debreczeni.Rădulescu, pp. 60–61.

History =First house= Chalfont Park developed from an area of land the size of two carucates acquired by Ranulph Brito, Treasurer of the Wardrobe, in March 1229 from Arnold de Turville in exchange for discharging his debt to Jews.Elvey (1961), p. 24 Ranulph enfeoffed Andrew le Goys with the manor,Elvey (1961), p. 25 and came into the possession of William Goys by 1302, and was owned by John Goys in 1316. In 1320, John Goys conveyed the manor to Geoffrey Bulstrode, from whom the manor acquired its name. Adam Bulstrode, likely Geoffrey's son, was in possession of the manor before 1346 and a Geoffrey Bulstrode held the manor in 1361. In the early 15th century, the manor was inherited by Agnes, daughter of Robert or Richard Bulstrode and wife of William Brudenell, who bequeathed the manor to her son Edmund, and the manor was henceforth known as Brudenells. Upon Edmund's death in 1469, his son Drew inherited the manor, and was inherited by Drew's son Edmund on his death in 1490. Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Brudenell and wife of Sir Robert Drury, inherited Brudenells from her father on his death in 1538. Brudenells was inherited by their son Robert who bequeathed the manor to his son Sir Henry on his death in 1592. Sir Henry mortgaged the manor in 1607, and was sold by his son William Drury to Henry Bulstrode in 1626. At this time Brudenells was leased to Thomas Baldwin for £150 pa,Edmonds & Baker (2003), p. 30 and was inherited by Henry's son Thomas who sold the manor to Sir Thomas Allen in 1645, and was in the possession of Frances Allen in 1651. Brudenells came into the possession of Dudley Rowse by 1657, but owed large debts to the crown and was thus seized after his death in 1678 and granted to George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys in 1688. However, the house is recorded to have been in the possession of Edward Penn in the same year. In 1714, Brudenells was purchased by John Wilkins,Edmonds & Baker (2003), p. 60 and was mortgaged to Lister Seman by 1736.Bucks Gardens Trust, Site Dossier: Chalfont Park (2016), p. 5 =Second house= The trustees of Charles Churchill bought the estate from Lister Seman in 1755 for his son Charles Churchill for £7600.Page (1925), pp. 193-198 The stable yard gateway was designed by Richard Bentley and constructed in 1755, and the house was rebuilt in Strawberry Hill Gothic in 1760 to designs by John Chute. Lancelot Brown was commissioned for a visit and a survey of the estate in 1763 for £35, which was possibly carried out by Nathaniel Richmond.Bucks Gardens Trust, Site Dossier: Chalfont Park (2016), pp. 5-6 Thomas Hibbert, son of Robert Hibbert, bought the estate in 1794,Hall et al. (2014), p. 219 and employed Humphry Repton who added a boathouse and icehouse, and widened the River Misbourne to form a lake. James Main was employed as head gardener in 1795, and Thomas Girtin was invited to the estate in 1796 and painted several views of the house and lake, and Chalfont Lodge.Bucks Gardens Trust, Site Dossier: Chalfont Park (2016), p. 6 Hibbert extended the estate in 1799 with the purchase of 31 acres and 152 acres to the north alongside Hogtrough Wood.Bucks Gardens Trust, Site Dossier: Chalfont Park (2016), p. 11 Between 1799 and 1800, John Nash was employed to enlarge the house and added a clock tower.Bucks Gardens Trust, Site Dossier: Chalfont Park (2016), p. 9 J. M. W. Turner also visited the estate and painted two watercolours of the house in 1800. Thomas died childless in 1819 and Chalfont Park was inherited by his brother Robert who bequeathed the estate to his son John Nembhard Hibbert on his death in 1835. In 1836, Anthony Salvin was employed to lay out a cricket pitch, and remodel the house by adding heraldic emblems and gargoyles and filling in the front arcades. John Nembhard Hibbert's executors sold Chalfont Park to Captain Berton after his death in 1886,Hall et al. (2014), p. 221 and parts of the estate was sold separately to form the town of Gerrards Cross. Berton had a cricket pitch laid out to the north of the house in 1887.Bucks Gardens Trust, Site Dossier: Chalfont Park (2016), p. 10 The house was advertised for sale in June 1888, but was not sold. An ancient coin found at the park in 1889 is considered one of the earliest forgeries in Britain.Head (2014), p. 75 Berton possessed the estate until its sale to John Bathurst Akroyd in 1899, who put the estate up for sale in 1905 and was bought by Edward Mackay Edgar in 1910. Edwin Lutyens was employed by Edgar's wife in 1913 to design an Italianate sunken garden to the northwest of the house with arbour, alcoves and a wishing well at one end and an orangery at the other end, and Gertrude Jekyll may have collaborated with Lutyens on the design of the gardens. The house served as an auxiliary hospital during the First World War, and after the war the stables were converted into a commercial garage.Bucks Gardens Trust, Site Dossier: Chalfont Park (2016), p. 8 The house became a hotel in 1921, and a golf course was created in the north park. The golf course was officially opened in spring 1922 with an exhibition match between George Duncan and Harry Vardon. In 1930, Chalfont Lodge became a girls' school. Chalfont Park House was later used as a training centre by the National Provincial Bank,Edmonds & Baker (2003), p. 25 and during the Second World War the house was used as a home for recovering servicemen.Chalfont St Peter Village Design Statement (2011), p. 8 In 1944, the remaining estate and house was purchased by British Aluminium Company.Bucks Gardens Trust, Site Dossier: Chalfont Park (2016), pp. 6-7 Chalfont Lodge became a training centre after the Second World War, and the Lutyens gardens were replaced by research laboratories in the 1950s. The orangery became an accelerated test facility for painted and anodised aluminium whilst the squash courts were converted to workshops. Members of the canoe club of British Aluminium Company formed the Chalfont Park Canoe Club in 1952. The 1965 film Thunderball was partly filmed at Chalfont Park House. The lake was dredged and the west side landscaped in 1985. In the late 20th century, Chalfont Lodge was destroyed and a care home was constructed in its place. Alcan Chemicals Ltd, the successor of British Aluminium Company, vacated the estate in July 1999,ALCAN CHEMICALS LIMITED. Companies House Beta and the research laboratories were subsequently redeveloped into a business park in 2000/2001.

Wills, a company which (building on the successful tobacco business established by their father) by the late 1800s had become Britain's largest importer of tobacco and manufacturer of tobacco products. Origins William Day Wills was born on 6 June 1797 in Bristol the elder of the two sons of Henry Overton Wills I (1761-1826) by his wife Ann Day. In 1786 his Salisbury-born father, with his partner Samuel Watkins, had opened a tobacco shop in Bristol, which grew into a successful business. Career =Business= In 1815 William and his younger brother Henry Overton Wills II (1800-1871) joined their father's firm and in 1826 following their father's death became co-owners of the company. In 1830 the brothers founded W.D. & H.O. Wills, which grew to become the leading importer of tobacco, and manufacturer of tobacco products in late 19th-century Britain. William retired in 1851 from full-time management of the firm and his responsibilities were taken over by his son William Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke. =Politics and religion= He made an unsuccessful foray into local politics in 1838 when he ran as the Liberal Party candidate for councillor of the Redcliffe ward in Bristol. However, he was successful on his second attempt in 1846, when he was elected councillor for the St Paul's ward of the city, a position which his brother Henry had held previously. He continued until 1861 to represent the St Paul's ward of the city, and served as a Charity Trustee from 1852 until his death. He was a Justice of the Peace at the time of his death. In religion he was an active a supporter of the Congregationalist faith, and he and his brother Henry were founder trustees in 1841 of the Hanham Chapel and in 1843 of the Barton Hill Chapel, both located in the Bristol suburbs. Marriage and children On May 2, 1820 in London he married Mary Steven, third daughter of Robert Steven of Glasgow, Scotland and of Camberwell in Surrey,Dictionary of National Biography, 1912 supplement, Wills, William Henry, by Charles Welch by whom he had three children, of whom only one survived: *William Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke (1830-1911), 2nd son and only surviving child, who in 1893 was created a baronet \\"of Coombe Lodge in the Parish of Blagdon in the County of Somerset\\" (following which he was known as \\"Sir William Wills, 1st Baronet\\") and in 1906 was raised to the peerage as Baron Winterstoke \\"of Blagdon in the County of Somerset\\". In 1901 he became chairman of the Imperial Tobacco Company, into which the Wills business had merged, which effectively made him the head of the British tobacco industry. Death and burial Tomb of William Day Wills at Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol Like his brother he grew partially deaf in later years and was fatally injured on 11 May 1865 in London having inadvertently stepped in front of a horse-drawn carriage. His left leg was severely crushed and he was rushed to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where his leg was amputated, but the strain was too much and he died on 13 May 1865 two days later.

Historically, computers have relied on text-based user interfaces and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) (such as the user pressing a \\"back\\" button) to translate the user's desired action into commands the computer understands. While an effective mechanism of completing computing actions, there is a learning curve for the user associated with GUI. Instead, CUIs provide opportunity for the user to communicate with the computer in their natural language rather than in a syntax specific commands. To do this, conversational interfaces use natural language processing (NLP) to allow computers to understand, analyze, and create meaning from human language. Unlike word processors, NLP considers the structure of human language (i.e., words make phrases; phrases make sentences which convey the idea or intent the user is trying to invoke). The ambiguous nature of human language makes it difficult for a machine to always correctly interpret the user's requests, which is why we have seen a shift toward natural-language understanding (NLU). NLU allows for sentiment analysis and conversational searches which allows a line of questioning to continue, with the context carried throughout the conversation. NLU allows conversational interfaces to handle unstructured inputs that the human brain is able to understand such as spelling mistakes of follow-up questions. For example, through leveraging NLU, a user could first ask for the population of the United States. If the user then asks \\"Who is the president?\\", the search will carry forward the context of the United States and provide the appropriate response. Conversational interfaces have emerged as a tool for businesses to efficiently provide consumers with relevant information, in a cost-effective manner. CUI provide ease of access to relevant, contextual information to the end user without the complexities and learning curve typically associated with technology. While there are a variety of interface brands, to date, there are two main categories of conversational interfaces; voice assistants and chatbots. Voice assistants A voice assistant is a user interface that allows a user to complete an action simply by speaking a command. Introduced in October 2011, Apple's Siri was one of the first voice assistants widely adopted. Siri allowed users of iPhone to get information and complete actions on their device simply by asking Siri. Further development has continued since Siri's introduction to include home based devices such as Google Home or Amazon Echo (powered by Alexa) that allow users to \\"connect\\" their homes through a series of smart devices to further the options of tangible actions they can complete. Users can now turn off the lights, set reminders and call their friends all with a verbal queue. These conversational interfaces that utilize a voice assistant have become an efficient and popular way for businesses to interact with their customers as the interface removes the typical friction in a customer journey. Customers no longer need to remember a long list of usernames and passwords to their various accounts; they simply link each account to Google or Amazon once, and gone are the days where you needed to wait on hold for an hour to ask a simple question. Chatbots A chatbot is a web- or mobile-based interface that allows the user to ask questions and retrieve information. This information can be generic in nature such as the Google Assistant chat window that allows for internet searches, or it can be a specific brand or service which allows the user to gain information about the status of their various accounts. Their backend systems work in the same manner as a voice assistant, with the front end utilizing a visual interface to convey information. This visual interface can be beneficial for companies that need to do more complex business transactions with customers, as instructions, deep links and graphics can all be utilized to convey an answer. The complexity to which a chatbot answers questions depends on the development of the back end. Chatbots with hard-coded answers has a smaller base on information and corresponding skills. Chatbots that leverage machine learning will continue to grow and develop larger content bases for more complex responses. More frequently, companies are leveraging chatbots as a way to offload simple questions and transactions from human agents. These chatbots provide the option to assist a user, but then directly transfer the customer to a live agent within the same chat window if the conversation becomes too complex.

The game is an entry in the original Mega Man series, and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in October 2018. The game brings back several features such as voice acting and a 2.5D graphic style from previous games throughout the Mega Man franchise. Gameplay Mega Man 11 retains the gameplay style of the classic Mega Man series of games, and features a 2.5D graphics style with 3D polygonal characters and 2D environments. Players control Mega Man in an attempt to stop Dr. Wily from using the Double Gear system that he invented many years before when he was at Robot University. Players travel through eight linear stages, which can be chosen in any way the player sees fit, and have to face Doctor Wily's newest Robot Masters, including Block Man, Fuse Man, Blast Man, Acid Man, Tundra Man, Torch Man, Impact Man, and Bounce Man. Mega Man can perform classic moves such as the chargeable Mega Buster and slide, as well as obtain new weapons by defeating Robot Master bosses at the end of each level. Unique to this game is the Double Gear system, which grants Mega Man two additional abilities: the Speed Gear and Power Gear. The Speed Gear lets Mega Man slow down time, allowing him to dodge attacks, while the Power Gear increases the attack power of Mega Man's weaponry, allowing him to fire two charged shots at the same time or a single, very powerful charged shot; however, there is a limit, showcased by a bar above Megaman's head, so if Mega Man uses them too much, he will overheat, making him unable to reuse them again for a few seconds. When Mega Man's health is critically low, he can activate both gears at the same time, slowing time and performing a powerful charge shot. This can only be used once and leaves Mega Man weakened after the limit expires: he can't charge his shots, can only fire a single solar bullet at a time and he will only have one unit of life energy, making the next hit he takes fatal for him, and even the cooldown period where he can't use the gears is longer because of the severe strains. The game has additional features including Time Trials, Missions, Global Leaderboards, a character gallery and more. The game also features difficulty settings, last seen in Mega Man 10, expanding upon them for a total of four: Newcomer, Casual, Normal, and Superhero. The Nintendo Switch version has Amiibo support, which can be used to unlock in- game items. Plot The story begins with a flashback of Dr. Light and Dr. Wily when they were students at Robot University at the exact moment they had their falling out. The committee is debating over choosing either Light's research of robots with independent thoughts or Wily's Double Gear system to continue work on. Despite Wily telling Light that they can't build the future on his so-called empty optimism, Light's research was chosen over Wily's because the Double Gear system puts an incredible strain on the robots that use it and could be dangerous in the wrong hands. Angry at being pushed aside and shut down in addition to being blocked by Light at every instance Wily destroys his prototype Double Gear and swears to Light that one day he will show the world and him he was right all along. After the flashback ends with Wily waking up disturbed (presumably the flashback served as a really bad dream), he suddenly remembers the Double Gear System. He immediately puts his plan into action, swearing revenge on Light. Meanwhile, at his lab, Dr. Light, Roll, and Auto are checking up on 8 latest generation models of Robot Masters (Block Man, Acid Man, Impact Man, Bounce Man, Fuse Man, Tundra Man, Torch Man, and Blast Man) for maintenance. Just as they finish with Block Man, Wily barges into the lab in his Wily Capsule and tells Light that he has perfected the Double Gear system. Mega Man (who was sweeping off-screen) rushes in to try to stop Wily, when at that moment the Robot Masters show up and Wily decides to use them as test subjects. Before they can escape, Wily uses the Speed Gear mode of his Double Gear to speed up the capsule and snatch the Robot Masters via tractor beam. Mega Man demands Wily to release them, but he takes them to his Fortress to have them reprogrammed and fitted with his upgraded Double Gear Systems. Just as Mega Man is about to leave to stop Wily, Light stops him and explains what the Double Gear System is and what it's capable of. He then warns Mega Man that if Wily really has perfected it, the latter won't stand a chance, but Mega Man refuses to let Wily get away. Realising that Mega Man won't be stopped, Light reveals that he kept and repaired the prototype Double Gear System that Wily used to own. After briefly warning Mega Man of its potential danger (with Mega Man accepting the risk), Light installs the Double Gear into Mega Man after several days so he can stand a chance against Wily's new army. After defeating 4 Robot Masters, Light explains to Mega Man that the Double Gear system was partly responsible for him and Wily falling out. Light believed that if robots were given the power to think for themselves, they could be true partners with humans. Wily, however, stated that even robots who think independently would be mere tools to humans, but by giving them power and speed boosts, then humans would finally respect robots for what they are and any robot could be a hero with the Double Gear System installed. However, when the committee chose Light over Wily, the latter stormed off never forgiving his old friend for not even giving him a chance. Back in the present, Light ponders about his decisions back then, and muses if he had shown him there was a way to work together instead of telling him that he was wrong, they might still have been friends even admitting that the Double Gear System can be used for good if used properly. Light then gives Mega Man the Rush Jet modification for Rush (Mega Man's robotic pet dog) with Mega Man then setting off to defeat the remaining Robot Masters. After defeating all 8 Robot Masters, Auto attempts to locate Wily. At first, it seemed as if Wily disappeared, when suddenly the lab's signal was intercepted, and Wily himself appeared on the screen. Angered that Mega Man not only defeated the Robot Masters but he also he used his prototype Double Gear System, Wily beckons Mega Man to come to his Gear Fortress so he can deal with him on his own. Mega Man heads out to stop Wily. After traversing the fortress, (while defeating the Yellow devil MK 3, Mawverne and the resurrected robot masters) Mega Man confronts Wily in his new Wily Machine and the two battle. In the end, Mega Man is victorious, causing Wily to resort to \\"Plan B\\", which was simply to kneel and beg for mercy. The \\"plan\\" fails when Mega Man doesn't fall for it, but Wily then mocks him, believing his loss wasn't caused by Mega Man, but rather the Double Gear System, which was his own technology, proclaiming himself as the better genius. Suddenly, Light walks in. Light asks Wily to look at Mega Man and explains that Mega Man holds tremendous power, but is intelligent enough to use it wisely; in a way, he is Light and Wily's ideas combined. Light asks Wily to atone for his crimes and be friends with him again, as before, so they could make other amazing ideas become reality, just like Mega Man. Wily refuses, stating his plans have only begun, and then escapes. Light fears he and Wily may never be able to work together again. As the fortress begins to collapse, Auto arrives, telling Light he had finished doing what he asked of him. With that, the three of them escape the collapsing fortress. Back at the lab, it's revealed that Light and Auto were at the Gear Fortress to find the parts in order to rebuild the Robot Masters. Auto uses Mega Man's Double Gear System to carry the Robot Masters to the repair room, so they can be sent back to their owners (during which he overheats and faints). Development The game was announced in December 2017 as part of the celebration of the series' 30th anniversary, along with the announcements of re-releases of earlier Mega Man games. Mega Man 11 features 3D polygonal characters and hand-drawn environments, departing from the pixel art-based approach from previous games, and is displayed in 2.5D. It was directed by Koji Oda and produced by Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, with character designs by Yuji Ishihara, and music by Marika Suzuki. According to Tsuchiya and Oda, the departure of Mega Man producer Keiji Inafune was mainly the reason for the long hiatus of a new game, as there was a huge hesitation for anyone to step up and become \\"the new Mega Man guy\\" until Oda himself did so. Mega Man 11 was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One on October 2, 2018, except in Japan where it was released two days later.

Nintendo Life gave it a 9/10 rating, writing that \\"Mega Man 11 is an excellent resurgence for the Blue Bomber, imbuing the tried-and-true classic gameplay with modern touches and new ideas that expand on existing concepts in interesting ways.\\" =Sales= During its first week on sale in Japan, the physical Nintendo Switch version of Mega Man 11 sold 14,650 copies, while the physical PlayStation 4 version sold 12,052 copies.

She was one of the founders of women's literary journalism in Mexico. Early life María Cristina Farfán Manzanilla was born on 24 July 1846 in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico to Candelaria Manzanilla and José María Farfán. She was raised in a strict environment and educated at home by the lawyer and teacher, José María Jesús Apolinario García Montero, typically known as José García Montero. Career With the help of García Montero, she secured a post as a teacher at the Colegio La Encarnación. On 3 May 1870, along with Gertrudis Tenorio Zavala and Rita Cetina Gutiérrez, Farfán founded La Siempreviva (The Everlasting), an organization which encompassed Mexico's first secular school for girls as well as an art college for young women; a scientific and literary society; and a newspaper, specifically written by and for women. Though careful not to present an anti- clerical image, the teachers at the school, which was directed by Cetina, based their curricula in science and rationalism, arguing that women were capable of working and intellectual thought. Farfán, Cetina and Tenorio were the first group to publicly promote educating women in Yucatán. The journal emphasized feminist writings and exposed many Mexican women to European feminism for the first time, and was published by the Palacio del Gobernador (the gubernatorial palace). Besides editing the magazine, the three friends published poems, dedicated to the improvement of women and their education. Farfán's first published work was La Aurora, a compilation of the works of Cetina, Tenorio and herself, which appeared in 1870. Throughout the period from 1870 to 1872, Farfán's works appeared in the journal La Siempreviva and in 1874, she published a collection of essays and poems, La Primavera. On 1 July 1877, Farfán married her previous instructor García Montero in Mérida and moved with him to Tabasco. In 1879, she founded and became director and editor-in-chief of the journal El Recreo del Hogar (Recreating the Home) in Tabasco, collaborating with other feminists, such as Dolores Correa Zapata. In 1880, she founded the school, Colegio del Porvenir (College of the Future). Both the journal and the school were based on the scientific themes she had previously implemented in Mérida. Death and legacy Farfán died in childbirth on the morning of 22 August 1880 after traveling by train arriving in San Juan Bautista de la Villa Hermosa, Tabasco, Mexico from Mexico City. Her newborn daughter died shortly thereafter. A funeral booklet, by some of the most noted authors of the period was written to commemorate Farfán's contributions as a pioneer educator and literary journalist. Three years after her death, the journal El Dominguero bestowed upon her the title of \\"Misionera de la Civilización\\" (Missionary of Civilization) to recognize how her literary contributions had changed societal perception and opportunities for women. In 1885, her husband removed her remains from Tabasco and reburied them in his family crypt in her home town of Mérida. The re-interment ceremony was widely attended by dignitaries, friends, and colleagues.

His work was featured at the Campbell Thiebaud Gallery (later the Paul Thiebaud Gallery), San Francisco. He became acquainted with Dennis Hare, Christopher Brown, Anthony Dubovsky and other exponents of the Bay Area Figurative Movement.Jonathan Saville,'But what are those Chefs Cooking', San Diego Reader, 17 November 1994. Wayne Thiebaud was one of the first painters to recognise his talents purchasing his work through his son Paul's Gallery.William Balthazar Rose – Patrons Following in the footsteps of Balthus, he moved to Sansepolcro, Tuscany, the birthplace of Piero della Francesca in 2003. Rose has lived for several years in Bath while maintaining residences in Monte Santa Maria Tiberina, Umbria and Borgo Sansepolcro, Tuscany. Rose has exhibited widely in the United States, England and continental Europe (see below). His work has been deeply influenced by Cezanne, Chardin, Corot, Giorgio Morandi and Goya in painting, and Pasolini and Peter Greenaway in film.'William Balthazar Rose: Sinfonia di Cappelli' (Exhibition Catalogue), essays by Paolo Turcis and Sean Gaston, analysis by Paolo Turcis, Serena Burroni and Federica Tiripelli. La Loggia Casa Editrice, Sansepolcro, Italy, 2007. Balthazar began painting the series that he calls ‘Cooks’ in 1991. The first examples were painted on small wooden panels and usually included a larger figure sitting to one side. Often inspired by medieval painting there is a comic quality to these painting which despite their origins in religious iconography speak of humanity’s eternal role as actors on the stage of life, sometimes play acting with great humour and other times acting out the gravest of tragedies.Rose, William Balthazar, Why I Paint Cooks, www.william-balthazar-rose.co.uk. Retrieved 27 November 2017 He has had solo shows alongside Howard Hodgkin and Wolf Kahn as well as group exhibitions with Alberto Sughi, Adriano Alumni, Mario Tozzi and Ottone Rosai. His talents and inspiration have been widely recognised by critics and patrons alike, best summarised by the following extract from Peter Davies' essay on Rose in a recent catalogue for Brian Sinfield gallery: > Indeed, despite a declared preference for the older European tradition, Rose > made early professional inroads on the West Coast which saw him meeting the > leading American painter Wayne Thiebaud whose hyperreal serialized > depictions of cakes and food items suggested the culinary thread later used > in Rose's chef compositions. Thiebaud, described by the younger British > artist as a \\"straightforward man\\" typified the hard-headed pragmatism and > rationalism of the modern American artist, a world apart from the eccentric > and introspective romanticism of the English ‘school’, and there is no doubt > that Thiebauld inspired Rose's acquisition of a detached professional > persona... At times Rose conjures late Sickert, Beckmann, Balthus, Morandi, > Manet, and Cezanne, variously inimitable and idiosyncratic painters who > provide an oblique benchmark for Rose's inherent individualism and > privileged position on a post-modern pluralist parapet.Peter Davies, > 'William Balthazar Rose', Catalogue, Brian Sinfield Gallery, June 2012 Honors and awards *Eisner prize, College of Environmental Design, University of California, Berkeley (1982) *Princeton full fellowship (1987–1989) *Bath Society of Artists (2010)Bath Society of Artists – William Balthazar Rose *First ever Artist-in-Residence, The Bishop's Palace, Wells (2013)First artist in residence appointed at Bishop's Palace in Somerset, Somerset County Gazette, 1 March 2015 Selected Exhibitions =United Kingdom= *Bishop's Palace, Wells, SomersetFirst artist in residence appointed at Bishop's Palace in Somerset, Somerset County Gazette, 1 March 2015 *Gallery 27, London *Peteleys, London *Mariners’ Gallery, St. Ives *The London Contemporary Art Fair, London *The Royal College of Art, London *Business Design Centre, Islington, London *S & D Gallery, Kensington, London *11 Princelet Street Gallery.

History  The Gambia had formed part of the British crown colony known as the Province of Senegambia, however this was revoked in 1821 and for legislative affairs The Gambia had to turn to Sierra Leone. In 1843, a Legislative Council in The Gambia consisting of the Governor and no less than two other public officials was created. In 1866, opinion back in Britain was in favour of withdrawing from Africa, and all British West African colonies were placed under the control of Sierra Leone again, per Colonel Harry Ord's suggestion. The Legislative Council established in 1843 was abolished, and a small council, consisting of the Administrator, the Collector of Customs, and the Chief Magistrate was created in its place. It was merely advisory and important legislative decisions were made in Sierra Leone. Nevertheless, over its lifetime it was gradually expanded, and by its supersedence by the Legislative Council again, it consisted of five officials and four unofficial members, of whom two were Africans.Darboe, pp. 28–29 The Gambia was detached from Sierra Leone in 1888, and the Legislative Council was re-established. It consisted of the Governor, the Treasurer, the Chief Magistrate, the Collector of Customs, and other people who held office in the colony as ex-officio members. Provision also existed for the appointment of unofficial members, who could hold office for five years and be re-appointed.Darboe, p. 30 The Legislative Council was established along with the Executive Council in 1901 as part of a progression towards self-government. By the 1940s, the Legislative Council had three or four unofficial members who were natives of the Gambia nominated by the Governor to serve on the council, but could not vote. In 1944, it was announced that proposals allowing for the direct election of one member had been put forward and were being implemented.  Structure  The Governor of the Gambia acted as the president of the Legislative Council, as well as of the Executive Council. They had the power to make law by proclamation, as well as to veto any law passed by the Legislative Council. The unelected members of the Legislative Council were the Colonial Secretary, the Financial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Senior Commissioner, the Director of Medical Services and two members appointed by the Governor from a list of nine names submitted by Bathurst Town Council and the Kombo Rural Authority.

Her father was a cook and her mother worked in the shops of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Kinney studied music at Western University, a historically black college in Quindaro, Kansas, where she participated in the harmony class and the choral society under the tutorship of Robert G. Jackson, Director of the music department. After she completed her college education she moved back to Sedalia where in 1911 she began a 35-year career as a teacher of music and English at the segregated secondary school, Lincoln High School. She became head of the school's music department and also gave piano recitals in Sedalia and surrounding towns. She had married Frederick Ferguson, an undertaker in 1918, but the couple separated in 1925.

Formally, reciprocal causation exists when process A is a cause of process B and, subsequently, process B is a cause of process A, with this feedback potentially repeated. Some researchers, particularly advocates of the extended evolutionary synthesis, promote the view that causation in biological systems is inherently reciprocal. History Harvard evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr (1961) suggested that there are two fundamentally different types of causation in biology, ‘ultimate’ and ‘proximate’. Ultimate causes (e.g. natural selection) were seen as (i) providing historical accounts for the existence of an organism's features, and (ii) explaining the function or ‘goal-directedness’ of living beings. In contrast, proximate causes (e.g. physiology) were seen as explaining how biological systems work. According to Mayr, the evolutionary sciences study ultimate causes and the rest of biology studies proximate causes. In some of his works, Mayr considered these domains autonomous: > “The clarification of the biochemical mechanism by which the genetic program > is translated into the phenotype tells us absolutely nothing about the steps > by which natural selection has built up the particular genetic program.” > > Mayr, 1980 There has been widespread acceptance of the proximate-ultimate dichotomy within the evolutionary sciences. However, many biologists, psychologists and philosophers have taken issue with Mayr's corollary that the proximate- ultimate distinction implies that development is irrelevant to evolution. For instance, evolutionary biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard writes: > “The proximate-ultimate distinction has given rise to a new confusion, > namely, a belief that proximate causes of phenotypic variation have nothing > to do with ultimate, evolutionary explanation.” > > West-Eberhard, 2003 Mayr's position implied a unidirectional or linear conception of causation for both development and evolution: genotypes cause phenotypes (proximate causation), whilst through natural selection, changes in environments cause changes in organisms (ultimate causation). Reciprocal causation was proposed as an alternative to this linear characterization. (see also ) It emphasizes how causation cycles through biological systems recursively, allowing proximate causes to feed back and thereby feature in ultimate explanations. Reciprocal causation in evolutionary biology Reciprocal causation features in several explanations within contemporary evolutionary biology, including sexual selection theory, coevolution, habitat selection, and frequency- dependent selection. In these examples, the source of selection on a trait coevolves with the trait itself, therefore causation is reciprocal and developmental processes potentially become relevant to evolutionary accounts. For instance, a peacock’s tail evolves through mating preferences in peahens, and those preferences coevolve with the male trait. The ‘ultimate explanation’ for the male trait is the prior existence of female preferences, proximately manifest in differential peahen mate choice decisions, whilst the ‘ultimate explanation’ for the peahens’ mating preferences is the prior existence of variation in the peacock's tail associated with fitness. This example illustrates how reciprocal causation is not a rejection of the proximate- ultimate distinction itself, but instead a rejection of the implication that developmental processes should not feature in evolutionary explanations. Reciprocal causation also applies in other domains of evolutionary biology. The extended evolutionary synthesis emphasizes how developmental events, including both the causal effects of environments on organisms (for instance, arising through developmental plasticity, or epigenetic inheritance) and the causal effects of organisms on environments (e.g. niche construction), can direct the course of evolution. Developmental plasticity, niche construction, extra-genetic forms of inheritance and developmental bias are recognized as playing evolutionary roles that cannot be reduced to natural selection of genetically encoded characters or strategies. Proximate causes are not autonomous from natural selection, but rather feed back to influence the rate and direction of adaptive evolution. This goes beyond the recognition that ontogenetic processes can impose constraints on the action of selection, or that proximate and ultimate processes interact. Rather, developmental processes are also seen as a source of evolutionary novelty, initiators of evolutionary episodes, and co-directors of patterns of evolutionary change. Contention Acceptance or rejection of Mayr's proximate-ultimate distinction may lie at the centre of several major debates within contemporary biology, concerning evo devo (evolutionary developmental biology), niche construction, cultural evolution, human cooperation, and the evolution of language. According to some biologists and philosophers, these disputes share a common pattern. On one side are researchers who consider that interaction and feedback processes traditionally characterized as ‘proximate’ have explanatory value for ‘ultimate’ evolutionary questions. Their concern is that the proximate-ultimate distinction has discouraged consideration of the manner in which developmental processes can set the evolutionary agenda, for instance, by introducing innovations, channeling phenotypic variation, or initiating evolutionary episodes through modifying selection pressures. One the other side are researchers who largely adopt Mayr's stance with a clean separation of proximate and ultimate causation. For the latter, a failure to respect Mayr's dichotomy is considered a sign of confusing an evolutionary explanation with a mechanistic explanation.

It was designed by the architect Paulo Antunes Ribeiro (1905–1973) for Prudência Capitalização, an insurance company. Construction began on the structure in 1946 and it opened in 1951. The Caramuru Building was one of the first Modernist building constructed in the Northeast Region of Brazil, closely following the construction of Hotel de Bahia. It was widely recognized by the domestic and international architectural press; it was described as having a \\"graceful, almost abstract elegance [...] contrasted with the robust architecture of Bahia.\\" The structure fell into disrepair but remains in the Comércio district. It is a protected structure by the state of Bahia and has provisional protected status by the by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN). Etymology Caramuru is a reference to Diogo Álvares Correia (c. 1475-1557), a Portuguese colonist who first lived with the Tupinambá people of Bahia. He later assisted Francisco Pereira Coutinho in founding Salvador da Bahia and in creating the first Portuguese colonial government in Brazil. History Paulo Antunes Ribeiro was among the first generation of modern Brazilian architects and his works, unusually, appeared outside the sphere of Rio de Janeiro-São Paulo modernist construction. Ribeiro's design demonstrates Le Corbusier's influence in Brazil, beginning in the mid-1930s; it includes the use of pilotis, an open floor plan, a flat facade, running windows, and a garden terrace. Ribeiro's success with the Caramuru Building continued with the Hotel da Bahia (1947/1951), also in Salvador; and Hotel Amazonas in Manaus. Following the Biennial prize for the Caramuru Building and subsequent note in the architectural press, Ribeiro became president of the Institute of Brazilian Architects, serving from 1953 to 1956. History The Caramuru Building was first vertical office building constructed in the Comércio district. The district, which consists of the old cidade baixa of Salvador and landfill It was funded and initially used as the headquarters of Prudência Capitalização, an insurance company. Construction of the building lasted ten years. Location The Caramuru Building overlooks Bahia de Todos os Santos on the corner of Rua da Grécia and Avenida Estados Unidos, an avenue which runs across the coastline of the bay. The building is located in the Comércio district of the lower city (cidade baixa) below the Historic Center of Salvador to the north west of the Mercado Model and the Lacerdo Elevator, both prominent historical landmarks in the lower city. Structure Caramuru Building was constructed using reinforced concrete with wood panels on the interior. It has seven stories and a penthouse apartment. The garden terrace is protected from excessive wind by curved walls of cement blocks. The building is built on the Franki piling system; the average depth of the piles is . In the garden terrace of Caramuru Building, an orthogonal prismatic volume houses an apartment for the directors of the company, while an attached cylindrical volume houses the engine room of the elevators. =Brises-soleils= Ribeiro's early use of brises-soleils was unique and widely noted in Brazil. He construction a system of light iron grids, 2 by 3 meters high, detached from the facades and arranged in two planes, alternating in chessboard, spaced 25 centimeters and supported on concrete consoles protruding from the floor slabs. Vertical panels measuring 6 square meters were covered by metal screens. Placed in an alternative design on two sides of the building to provided solar protection to the interior. Additionally, they provided an open view of the Bay of All Saints, now obstructed. =Terrace garden and Orfeu Sculpture= The Caramuru Building demonstrates the integration between art and architecture characteristic of period in its use of a wire sculpture by Mario Cravo Júnior. Cravo Júnior's work was placed on the curved façade of the penthouse apartment and faced the rooftop garden. The sculpture, called Orfeu (Orpheus), and made of delicate copper wire. It was lost or destroyed some time in the early 21st century. =Interior design= Internal partitions on the office floors were made of wood and removed as needed. Reception and honors The Caramuru Building received significant notice after its construction, both within Brazil and by architectural publications overseas. It was featured in L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui (1952), Domus (1954) and Architectural Review (1954). The Carumaru Building received honorable mention at the 1st International Architecture Biennial of São Paulo in 1951. The architectural historical José Eduardo Lefèvre calls the building an \\"icon of modernist architecture in Brazil and a point of international reference in our country.\\" Protected status The Caramuru Building is a protected structure by the state-level Instituto do Patrimônio Artístico e Cultural da Bahia (IPAC). It attained provisional protected status by the by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 2008. Condition IPAC and other government bodies attempted to renovate and restore the Caramuru Building after it received landmark status in 2007. IPAC negotiated an agreement between the owners of the Caramuru Building and Mário Cravo Júnior to produce a new version of Orfeu sculpture; its attempts were unsuccessful. Reconstruction of the garden terrace was planned and partially executed. Access The Caramuru Building functions as a government office and may not be visited.

The crew could not see a thing because of smoke from several forest fires, due to this William C. Moreland ran full steam on to the reef. There were many attempts to salvage the ship, but eventually only the long stern was salvaged and was used to build the long . Sir Trevor Dawson was christened on 18 October 1916, exactly six years after William C. Moreland wrecked. Sir Trevor Dawson continued to sail for fifty-four years until she was scrapped in 1970, in Spain as the steamer Parkdale. History In 1906 the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company commissioned two long freighters named and both named after the company's founders, and both built by the Great Lakes Engineering Works (GLEW) of Ecorse, Michigan. The large fleet was managed by W.H. Becker, a prominent fleet manager and owner from Cleveland, Ohio. Due to the increasing demand for iron ore Jones and Laughlin Steel Company commissioned two identical vessels; William C. Moreland from American Shipbuilding Company (AMSHIP) and from GLEW. They were identical in every respect and had a length of and a 12.000 cargo capacity. It was reported that William C. Moreland was the last launching of the year at AMSHIP's Lorain, Ohio yard. Miss Esther Moreland of Pittsburgh christened the new vessel. She was the niece of the vessel's namesake, a prominent Pittsburgh attorney who was a vice-president and secretary of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company. On August 23, 1910 William C. Moreland was temporarily enrolled at Cleveland, Ohio and assigned a U.S. official identification number U.S. #207851 for delivery to Jones and Laughlin's Interstate Steamship Company fleet. William C. Moreland cost nearly $450,000, she was 600 feet in overall length ( between perpendiculars) with a beam of feet and a depth of feet and measured at 7,514 gross register tons and 5,803 net register tons. The she was powered by a triple-expansion steam engine and fueled by two coal-fired Scotch marine boilers. She had an arch frame construction and three cargo holds with 36 cargo hatches placed on centers. William C. Moreland was Jones and Laughlin's largest ship at the time of her construction. William C. Moreland usually carried coal when she was upbound and iron ore when she was downbound. Final voyage On her fifth trip William C. Moreland left Superior, Wisconsin during the early hours October 18, 1910 with 10,700 tons of iron ore bound for Ashtabula, Ohio. The weather on Lake Superior was relatively mild with little or no wind or wave action, but visibility was hampered by smoke coming from several forest fires burning on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Vast stretches of brush and forests were burning on the peninsula due to drought-like conditions in the area causing severe visibility problems. Approaching the Keweenaw Peninsula about 17 hours after she left port the first mate, unsure of William C. Morelands position sighted an unidentified beam of white light. He called Captain Claude Ennes to the bridge at about 9:00 at night. A few minutes later William C. Moreland ran aground Sawtooth Reef. Salvage efforts The hull of William C. Moreland remained intact until October 20, 1910 when the ship broke in two between the tenth and eleventh hatch due to the pressure the hull was under. Further cracking occurred near hatch 23 due to the enormous strain put on the hull by the flooded and loaded cargo holds and the unsupported midsection. The salvage rights were eventually sold to the Reid Wrecking Company of Sarnia, Ontario. The Reid Wrecking Company managed to salvage the -long stern of the ship, the -long bow stayed on the reef until it slid off and sank. The stern was reused as part of Sir Trevor Dawson. On March 25, 1911, American Shipbuilding Company launched the -long freighter which was ordered by the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company to replace William C. Moreland. Thomas Walters sailed until 1984 when she was scrapped in Ashtabula, Ohio. William C. Moreland wreck The remains of William C. Moreland rest in of water. The wreck has been largely flattened by years of ice and wave action, but the there is still a lot of machinery, and numerous pieces of her hull left on the wreck site. William C.

They were led by head coach Kevin Donley, who served his 16th year as the first and only head coach in the history of Saint Francis football. The Cougars played their home games at Bishop John D'Arcy Stadium and were members of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA) Mideast League (MEL). The Cougars finished 1st in the MSFA MEL division and received an automatic bid to participate in the postseason NAIA playoffs.  Schedule  (9-3 overall, 5-1 conference) Game summaries 9/14/2013 - The Cougars opened the season against a formidable opponent in William Penn. The week prior, the Statesmen had opened their season with a convincing victory over then 9th-ranked Bethel (TN). The lack of a poll after that week kept the Statesmen from a higher national ranking. This game was tied 10-10 at the half. But USF took control in the second half, aided by a game-ending injury to the Statesmen's starting quarterback. The Cougars scored the last 21 points in the game. For their effort on the week, the Cougars were elevated to #2 in the NAIA Coaches Poll. 9/21/2013 - The Cougars home opener was against St. Ambrose, a tough 7th- ranked team that gave the Cougars a 1-point loss last season. The game's outcome wasn't certain until all time had expired from the clock. After scoring a late 4th quarter touchdown, the Bees had a chance to kick for 1 point to tie the score at 38-38. But the Bees opted instead to attempt a 2-point conversion. An incomplete pass denied the Bees the lead at that time. Later in the quarter, as time was running out, The Bees attempted a game- winning field goal. But the kick sailed wide as the clock struck :00, and Saint Francis came away with a 1-point victory of their own, 38-37. Next week, the Cougars return to the road to face their 3rd ranked opponent in 3 weeks when they visit #7 Grand View (IA). 9/28/2013 - The Cougars went on the road and fell to defeat against an impressive Grand View team, 23-7. For their win, Grand View improved to #4 in the national polls, while Saint Francis dropped 4 places to #6. The Cougars next opponent, Siena Heights (Mich.), entered the national polls for the first time, appearing at #25 in this week's rankings. 10/5/2013 - The Cougars went on the road to another tough ranked opponent. The Cougars trailed 17-14 at halftime. Under the leadership of quarterback David Yoder, who replaced an injured Josh Miller, the Cougars scored two touchdowns in the second half while holding Siena Heights scoreless to give them a 28-17 victory. This was their first conference win of the season.

Payne is a psychologist and Associate Professor at the University of Notre Dame. Payne's research focuses on the impact of sleep and stress on human memory and psychological well being. Payne won the Early Career Award from the Psychonomic Society in 2015. Previously, she received the Laird Cermak Award for early contribution to memory research by the International Neuropsychological Society in 2010. Payne has contributed her expertise on sleep to media outlets including New York Times, CNN, and Huffington Post.  Biography  Payne completed her B.A. degree in psychology (summa cum laude) in 1995 at the University of San Diego. She went to graduate school at Mount Holyoke College, where she obtained her M.A. in experimental psychology in 1999. She continued her education, receiving a PhD in psychology and cognitive neuroscience at the University of Arizona in 2005, where she worked under the supervision of Lynn Nadel and focused on the effects of stress on memory. Payne completed two postdoctoral fellowships (2005-2009), the first at the Harvard Medical School, where she worked under the supervision of Robert Stickgold, and the second at Harvard University, where she worked with Daniel Schacter and Robert Stickgold. Payne joined Department of Psychology at the University of Notre Dame in 2009, where she is the Nancy O'Neill Collegiate Chair in Psychology and Director of the Sleep, Stress, and Memory Lab. She serves on the neuroscience advisory board of the NeuroLeadership Institute and is Associate Editor of the Journal of Experimental Psychology; General.  Research  Payne's research focuses on how sleep and stress impact cognition, memory, and psychological functioning. Several of her studies have examined memories of emotional events experienced under conditions of stress or sleep deprivation, which may be subject to distortion or false memory, due to the release of stress hormones. When someone is sleep deprived and under stress, frontal lobe circuits may be compromised and the amygdala may become hyperactive, resulting in elevated levels of cortisol which impacts memory consolidation. Payne and her colleagues have explored how memory may be enhanced when individuals sleep shortly after encoding new information. In one of their studies using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm, volunteers learned a list of related words that they had to recall after a 12-hour delay. Half learned the list at 9 a.m. and were tested at 9 p.m. whereas the other half learned the list at 9 p.m. and were tested the following day at 9 a.m. after a night's sleep. Participants who had slept performed better at recalling the list than those who stayed awake. At the same time, those who slept were also more likely to experience false memories, i.e., they recalled words that were related in meaning to the items on the list but were not actually present. Such findings suggest that a creative synthesis of information may occur during sleep. In other work, Payne and her colleagues examined the effect of sleep on relational memory defined as the \\"flexible ability to generalize across existing stores of information.\\" Participants learned pairs of premises with an embedded hierarchy and were tested on their ability to draw logical inferences based on the premises. Participants who slept prior to testing were better able to draw the inferences than participants who did not sleep, even though all groups showed accurate retention of the information contained in the premises. Payne's research provides support for the view that unique properties of sleep are directly involved in declarative memory consolidation. She suggests that incorporating a 20-minute nap each day would be beneficial for psychological and physical health, as it helps the brain to encode incoming information and may lead to higher levels of creativity. Payne notes that it is important to limit naps to 20 minutes to avoid the risk of falling into a deep sleep and waking amidst slow-wave sleep. Naps are an effective way to compensate for sleep debt, i.e., the cumulative effect of not getting enough sleep. As alternative strategies to enhance brain activity. Payne suggests engaging in five-minute meditation exercises, engaging in diaphragmatic breathing, taking walks, and changing one's environmental surroundings.

Published between 1763 and 1765, the magazine obtained a great success, especially for the polemical shots and the bright tones with which Baretti expressed his opinions towards numerous writers, his contemporaries or the past.  History  During the years spent in England, Giuseppe Baretti had the opportunity to appreciate the liveliness of the English press. Back in Italy, he had decided to settle in Venice and to found a periodical on the model of \\"Tatler\\" and \\"Spectator\\". thumb Baretti decided to sign the magazine under the pseudonym of Aristarco Scannabue, a character of his invention, to whom he dedicated a lively description in the introductory part. The figure he built, that of a former soldier who had fought for years in the East, was completely opposed to that of the eighteenth century academic scholar. Baretti imagined that Scannabue, after having retired to a country place, spent time reviewing, with strong criticism, all the books that were published and that were given to him by Don Pietro Zamberlucco, the parish priest of the place. The first issue of the magazine came out on October 1, 1763 in Venice, but with the indication of Rovereto (a town located outside the borders of the Republic of Venice). The purpose of the founder was to avoid incurring the rigors of censorship. As for the title, the name \\"Frusta\\" (Whip) symbolizes the intentions of Baretti to whip metaphorically, through fierce criticism, all those who were considered by him as bad writers. Baretti succeeded in gaining many readers, but at the same time there was no lack of controversy. At the beginning of 1765 the magazine came to the attention of the Reformers, the magistrature charged with monitoring the conformity of the printed works with the laws of the state. Numerous citizens, resentful of the criticisms made by Baretti against Pietro Bembo, a sixteenth-century poet, beloved by the Venetians, asked the Reformers to cease publication of the magazine. The magazine was not closed, but underwent strong censorship. Baretti, who at first seemed to want to abandon the project, decided to move to another state. He began to print his periodical in Ancona, in the Papal States, starting from April 1, 1765. From then on, all the remaining eight issues of the magazine, from April 19 to July 15, 1765, were dedicated to the impetuous criticism against his father Appiano Buonafede, who a few months earlier had published a work, full of rancor against the Baretti, titled Novelle Menippe by Luciano Firenzuola against a certain pseudepigraphic Frusta by Aristarco Scannabue.

Thailand is a developing country within Southeast Asia, and is currently confronted with this problem. There are a number of factors that determine the digital divide within a country, including income, choice of technologies (e.g., owned mobile phone, owned laptop and/or personal computer) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., gender, level of education, age). ICT development and mobile penetration are strongly correlated with economic growth and social benefits.  Internet access  The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society National Statistical Office = Mobile internet and wireless technology = Before Internet was launched commercially in 1995, there was a very low rate of users in Thailand. Mobile Internet access was first introduced to the Thai market in December 2000 by Advanced Info Service (AIS), the largest nationwide mobile operator. Since 2005, the Internet market has been liberalized. At the end of 2010, there were more than 80 active Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Ten of these are major ISPs, including mobile operators which provide mobile Internet. The price of Internet service is cheaper than it was in the early stage of introduction. Wireless technology has shifted the world of fixed Internet access to mobile Internet access, thanks to the growing penetration of wireless devices and rapid technological development. Mobile Internet is significantly different from fixed Internet, in terms of mobility and convenience. The two trends that have driven the growth of mobile Internet in Thailand are the introduction of third-generation mobile technology (3G) and improved coverage of mobile infrastructure. At the end of 2009, the mobile penetration rate was 98.58%, while the fixed telephony and Internet penetration rates were 11.12% and 25.80%, respectively. By 2010, the mobile penetration rate reached 100%. The underdevelopment of fixed infrastructure has led to a low fixed Internet penetration rate compared with mobile Internet penetration rate. In 2009 more than 50% of Internet subscribers were broadband subscribers. = NTC survey = In 2010, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) commissioned a nationwide face-to-face, interview-based survey of people in Thailand. The questionnaire consisted of 10 parts: 9 regarding telecommunications and media services such as fixed telephony, mobile telephony, the Internet, public phone, radio, and television, and the rest were about socio-economic backgrounds.  Population  Survey respondents were selected across each region of Thailand: Bangkok, Central, North, Northeast and South. The sample consisted of two groups of respondents: 1) consumers who accessed mobile Internet as their primary Internet connection, connecting either via a mobile device or USB cards, and 2) consumers with fixed Internet connection as their primary access. All respondents were under 15 years, and non-Internet users and incomplete answers were excluded from the sample. The total sample size after data cleaning was 739 respondents.  Findings  The characteristics of the survey were compared with the National Statistic Office (NSO) database in 2009. The survey drew data from 9 provinces, and the typical respondent was 30 years old with a bachelor's degree and a monthly income of 12,384.90 THB. = Limitations and effects = As a developing country, Thailand is confronted with the digital divide both at a national and international level. The underdevelopment of fixed infrastructure has led to a low Internet penetration rate. On the other hand, the mobile penetration rate is higher than fixed in terms of network coverage and subscription. The price of mobile Internet service is inelastic, so an increase in price does not affect the need to access mobile Internet. The price is a result of the lack of competition in fixed connection, which also results in limited choices for consumers.  Factors influencing internet access  = Education = Internet is readily available at universities for students attending the school. This internet service is available to students, teachers, faculty and staff. Educational software has been developed and available for students attending the university. Wifi is one of the technology services available at universities. Education is largely based from books but schools are now incorporating the internet into their studies. Education is largely biased to the upper class. The upper class has the funds to afford education. This contributes to the digital divide in Thailand from the perspective that the lower class can not afford education and therefore does not have access to the internet. = Income = Thailand since 1988 has continuously lowered their poverty rate from approximately 34% to 9%. However, there is a disparity among regions in Thailand. Such that the Northeast and North region account for about 40% of the 9% that are in poverty with the whole kingdom accounting for 9 percent. The South, Central and Bangkok combined are less than 9% of the poverty rate. Lower income families cannot afford the luxuries like mobile devices that allow access to the internet. Higher income families have the ability to use extra funds to purchasing Internet and wireless devices that allow access to the Internet. = Location = Statistics compiled by the National Statistical Office on household utilization of information and communication technology revealed that during 2005-2014, computer users increased steadily in number both in urban and rural areas. In urban areas, computer users rose from 35.5% of the population in 2005 to 47.8% in 2014, while those in rural areas the percentage rose from 19.7% to 30.4% in the same period. However, the gap of urban and rural computer users during this period remained at a relatively wide margin of approximately 15–19%, although this urban-rural gap showed signs of narrowing slightly after 2011. In urban areas, Internet subscription increased from 21.2% of the population in 2005 to 44.9% in 2014, and in rural areas from 8% to 26.9% However, the gap of urban and rural computer users during this period remained at a relatively wide margin of approximately 13–19%, and this urban-rural gap showed signs of widening further in 2011 mainly due to a projected rise in subscription of mobile Internet services in urban areas. = Age = In Thailand, the younger generation is heavily populating the universities and schools. This will account for the age gap in internet usage. According to a study conducted in 2006 by Okazaki, affluent youth is the core segment of mobile Internet adoption The older generation is not naturally receptive to the learning of the internet. This will compound on to the age divide of internet usage, and furthermore add to the digital divide in Thailand. = Gender = According to a study conducted in 2010, the gender divide does not exist in Thailand. Gender has no effect in the digital divide in Thailand. Women and men are fairly even in the education system. This allows both genders to have access to the internet. This creates little to no gender gap in usage of the internet. = Solutions = To help resolve the digital divide in Thailand, the current companies need to expand and create more affordable options. Mobile Internet should be easily accessible in dense populations and rural areas as well. A more attended and better education system will help resolve the digital divide in Thailand.  Investment in infrastructure  In 2010, Chalita Srinuan, Ph.D Student, and Erik Bohlin, Professor, from the Department of Technology Management and Economics at the Chalmers University of Technology in Göteborg, Sweden conducted a study investigating the determinant factors that could explain the digital divide phenomena in Thailand. The results show that the availability of a fixed telephone at home, becoming a mobile subscriber and the availability of traditional media are the determinants for using the Internet. The demographic background also affects the probability of using the Internet, for example age, education and area of residence. The results suggest that policies related to infrastructure and education are important to bridge the digital divide. Telecom regulators and government agencies such as the National Regulatory Agency (NRA) need to build telecommunication networks that could adequately serve different regions of Thailand. Investing in fixed/fixed wireless and wireless infrastructure can stimulate the growth of mobile Internet by increasing competition. The Thai government, regulators, and other stakeholders are encouraging the ICT industry to provide communications and services for all by fostering investment and removing regulatory bottlenecks.  Mobile internet  The benefits of mobile Internet can be seen as offering an alternative for bridging the digital divide, in particular, for a developing country such as Thailand where fixed telephony is not available. The three main conditions for mobile Internet are accessibility, availability and affordability of service and applications, which are all applicable to Thailand. In terms of accessibility and availability, the wireless infrastructure, in particular Wi- Fi hotspots, only provides full coverage in populated areas.  Education  The results indicate that the digital divide cannot be reduced without an education program. The government controls education system. For the education system to progress, the government needs to invest more money and energy. This will help bridge the digital divide in Thailand.

The heroine, dressed as a page, escapes her captors in a bandits' cave. Ferdinando Eboli is a Gothic tale written by Mary Shelley and published in The Keepsake for 1829. It is set in Italy during the Napoleonic Wars and tells the story of an Italian man named Count Ferdinando Eboli whose identity is stolen by his illegitimate older brother.  Summary  Count Ferdinando Eboli is about to leave his home in Naples to fight for his king, King Murat (Gioacchino), but before he leaves he pays a farewell visit to his fiancée Adalinda, and her father, the Marchese Spina. After he leaves, Adalinda is musing over her love for him when she hears a noise beneath her window, and is surprised to see Ferdinand there. He climbs up into her room and asks for a lock of her hair, but he cuts his hand while snipping it. She binds his hand with one of her ribbons, and he departs. Ferdinand is stationed in northern Italy and is sent on an important mission by Gioacchino. While performing this mission, Ferdinand is ambushed and taken to a remote shack, where he is given peasant's clothes in exchange for his own and is tied up and left by his attackers. He is freed by two peasant children and returns to headquarters, ashamed to have failed in his task. When he arrives, he is arrested as a spy, and when he is brought before the king he confronts a man who looks exactly like him and is wearing his stolen clothes. This impostor claims to be the real Ferdinand, and has been welcomed back as a hero for completing the dangerous mission. The king banishes Ferdinand, who returns to the Marchese's home. The Marchese recognizes him in spite of his altered appearance, but the imposter soon arrives and confounds the Marchese. He asks Adalinda to identify her betrothed, and she identifies the man with the cut on his hand. Ferdinand, with nowhere else to go, returns to his estate, where he is once again met by the impostor. He is arrested and imprisoned. The impostor visits him in jail tells him that he has already married Adalinda, which is a lie. He offers to have him freed if he signs a statement acknowledging the imposter as the true Eboli, but Ferdinand refuses. He is sent away to fulfill his sentence but escapes with a fellow prisoner. While Ferdinand is in jail, the Marchese dies, and Adalinda's marriage to Eboli is therefore delayed. As the weeks pass, Adalinda begins to suspect that the man she identified is not the real Ferdinand. She confronts him, and he reveals the truth, that he is Ferdinand's illegitimate older brother, and was raised by his jilted mother to one day take revenge upon his brother by stealing his identity. He tells Adalinda that she cannot escape, since he has replaced all of her attendants with his own people. She does manage to escape, however, by disguising herself as a page, but is forced to take shelter in what appears to be a banditto's cave after becoming lost in the woods. Two men appear: Ferdinand and his friend from prison, who have been leading a band of banditti following their escape from prison. One of their men capture the impostor in the wood as he looks for Adalinda. Ferdinand and Adalinda seek help from Queen Caroline, who helps them bring the impostor before the King, who restores the real Ferdinand to his rights and fortune. He and Adalinda marry, and forgive the impostor, Ludovico. He joins the army and fights with his brother in Moscow, where Ludovico dies of exposure. Ferdinand would have suffered the same fate, but is captured by the enemy and eventually liberated after Napoleon's exile to Elba.  Publication History  \\"Ferdinando Eboli\\" was first published in The Keepsake for 1829, a British literary annual. It was accompanied by an engraved illustration entitled Adalinda, painted by Alfred Edward Chalon and engraved by Charles Heath. It was reprinted in several anthologies since, but is not widely read or studied. The Keepsake for 1829 is notable for its list of contributors, which includes many of the most popular writers and artists of the day, many of whom are canonical Romantic artists.  Themes and Influences  \\"Ferdinando Eboli\\" is one of several Gothic tales that Mary Shelley published in The Keepsake. Others include \\"The Evil Eye\\" (1830), \\"Transformation\\" (1831), \\"The Invisible Girl\\" (1832), \\"The Dream\\" (1833), and \\"The Mortal Immortal\\" (1834). The central motif in this tale is the characteristic Gothic motif of the double, or doppelgänger, which Shelley also employs in \\"Transformation\\" and her novel Frankenstein. Other examples of nineteenth-century Gothic fiction that employ this motif include James Hogg's The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1824), Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). \\"Ferdinando Eboli\\" is often classified as a short story, but that term was not common in Britain until the 1880s. It is more accurately categorized as a Gothic tale: one that describes a strange or supernatural experience, often by a first- or third-person narrator.

The episodes broadcast on Mutual originated at WOR, making the program the first live serial that Mutual broadcast from New York City. Format In its early years, Front Page Farrell was much like other soap operas in that it focused on the domestic situations of a married couple, David and Sally Farrell. David Farrell was a newspaper reporter, and in the 1950s, the program's focus shifted more to his work, such as \\"hard-hitting tales of murder investigations as Farrell tracked cold-blooded killers.\\" Each of Farrell's investigations of crimes usually began on Monday and concluded on Friday, which aided infrequent listeners. Episodes Typical examples of Front Page Farrell cases (each solved within one week) included: *\\"The Deep- Freezer Murder Case\\", in which a department store executive's body was found in a refrigeration unit. *\\"The Fountain of Youth Murder Case\\", in which a former beauty queen was killed during a rejuvenation treatment. *\\"The Blinding Light Murder Case\\", in which the owner of a modeling agency was murdered. *\\"The Interrupted Wedding Murder Case\\", in which the father of the bride was murdered and a valuable wedding gift disappeared.

The race's origins lie in 1862, when Hallam F.C. promoted the start of their football season by organising a ten-mile steeplechase. The event was won by T. Moore of the rival Sheffield F.C. and generated great attention. Numerous similar events were launched in the region. The following year, a second run from Hallam F.C.'s Sandygate ground was organised. Described as the Great Hallamshire Steeplechase, runners went to Christ Church, Stannington, and back again, J. C. Shaw of Hallam winning on this occasion. During the 19th-century, the event remained highly popular, with a crowd of 20,000 spectators reported in 1883, and there was much betting on the results. Runners spent a significant time preparing for the race, and it was known for some strong runners to enter in disguise, in the hope of deceiving the bookmakers' handicapper. However, bookmakers were also known to employ \\"nobblers\\", who would obstruct the leading runners at gates and stiles along the route, to aid the runners on whom they would make a profit. In 1887, organisation of the event was taken over by the Hallamshire Cricket Club, and it was for the first time run under the rules of the Amateur Athletic Association. However, crowds fell, and in 1894, it was decided to again permit professional athletes. This change was not considered a success, with only 3,000 spectators attending. By 1900, the event was again being organised by the football club. Over the years, all the other local steeplechases were abandoned, but the Hallam Chase continued, with breaks around World War I and World War II. The course, of about three-and-a-half miles, has long been regarded as extremely challenging due to its steep slopes. In the early 20th-century, it was nicknamed the \\"Race Across the Alps\\". Sebastian Coe took part in the event as a club runner with the Hallamshire Harriers. He described the course as \\"bloody horrific. Down the rocks into a ravine, up the rocks on the other side. Down the rocks again and up the rocks scrabbling with hands and feet\\". The fell race is now always on the Tuesday evening after the second bank holiday in May, starting 20:00 from the Hallamshire Cricket Ground. It is open to male and female runners from South Yorkshire road and fell running clubs, under a handicap system. The handicap is set so the slower runners go off first and the quicker runners last- the idea being that all the runners return together. This may have the effect of discouraging stronger runners from taking part. The course record of 19:42 was set by Trevor Wright in 1968, although given the handicap system Terry Allcock (Hallamshire Harriers) was the winner of that years race.

She is known for her research on the development of social categories, transgender youth, and variation in human gender development. Olson was recipient of the 2016 Janet Taylor Spence Award from the Association for Psychological Science for transformative early career contributions, and the 2014 SAGE Young Scholars Award. Olson received the Alan T. Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation in 2018, and was the first psychological scientist to receive this prestigious award honoring early-career scientists. Olson is a member of the 2018 cohort of MacArthur \\"Genius\\" fellows.Meet the Academics Who Nabbed This Year’s MacArthur ‘Genius’ Grants, Julian Wyllie, The Chronicle of Higher Education, October 4, 2018.  Biography  Kristina Olson received her B.A. in Psychology and African and African-American Studies from Washington University in 2003. She completed her PhD from Harvard University in 2008, where she worked with Elizabeth Spelke, Mahzarin Banaji, and Carol S. Dweck. After graduating from Harvard, Olson joined the faculty of Yale University. In 2013, she subsequently moved to the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington where she directs the Social Cognitive Development Lab. Olson's research has been funded through the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Arcus Foundation.  TransYouth Project  Olson directs The TransYouth Project, which is the largest-to-date longitudinal research study of transgender children, with over 350 children enrolled from across the United States and Canada. The TransYouth Project \\"aims to help scientists, educators, parents, and children better understand the varieties of human gender development.\\" Recent findings from this project indicate that transgender children are not confused, delayed, pretending, or oppositional with regards to their gender identity. On tasks, such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which measure social knowledge, attitudes, and stereotypes about gender, transgender children respond similarly to \\"typical\\" cisgender children who match their gender identity (i.e., their expressed gender). Such findings suggest that the gender identity of transgender children is stable and deeply held. In research examining mental health outcomes, Olson and colleagues have observed typical rates of depression and only marginally elevated rates of anxiety in transgender children when compared to control groups of children. Such findings contrast with reports of poor mental health outcomes among transgender adults, who frequently experience discrimination and marginalization. In interviews, Olson has emphasized the importance of supportive parents and families in helping transgender youth feel accepted, safe, and secure, especially as they transition through adolescence to adulthood.

The Hopi, who have historic interest in this site, refer to it as \\"Tutuveni\\" meaning \\"Newspaper Rock\\". The site was used by young Hopi men during their ceremonial pilgrimages to Ongtupqa (the Grand Canyon) to mark their passage into adulthood. They would stop and camp at the site and would etch their clan symbols onto the rocks, showing their participation and passage in that pilgrimage. This was a tradition that was carried on for four to five centuries by the Hopi. Although the site is recognized as a Hopi traditional cultural property, it is located on land now owned by the Navajo Nation. There was therefore a decades-old dispute whereby the neighboring tribes fought over the ownership of the land. The conflict was resolved in 2006, with much of the disputed 1.5 million acres going to the Navajos. Clan petroglyphs The site contains more than 5,000 Hopi clan symbols, dating from perhaps as early as 1200 to the 1950s, inscribed on eight sandstone boulders. The boulders are scattered over an area of approximately , the tallest of which may reached over 5 meters. These petroglyphs cover the sides and tops of the boulders, and most of the symbols, 60% of the total, are on one stone known as boulder 48. The petroglyphs, each around 10x10cm, are of iconic symbols representing animals, plants, or cultural items. The unusual features of these symbols compared to other petroglyphs sites are that the symbols rarely overlap, and they may be arranged as rows of repeating images of up to 20 or more in a line. These repeated image may be from members of the same clan making the same pilgrimage to Tutuveni - new pilgrims would then put their symbols next to the symbols the previous Hopi pilgrims. The site however has suffered from vandalism, with graffiti added to the boulders and some symbols were erased or spray-painted over. As a result, fencing had been introduced and surveillance cameras installed.

They were led by head coach Kevin Donley, who served his 15th year as the first and only head coach in the history of Saint Francis football. The Cougars played their home games at Bishop John D'Arcy Stadium and were members of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA) Mideast League (MEL). The Cougars finished tied for 1st in the MSFA MEL division and received an at- large bid to participate in the postseason NAIA playoffs.  Schedule  (9-3 overall, 4-1 conference) Game summaries The 2012 season opened with the Cougars ranked #6 in the coaches preseason poll. 8/25/2012 - The Cougars traveled to Texas to play the season opener against a new opponent. The game was the farthest west the Cougars had ever ventured to play a football game. The Cougars returned to Fort Wayne with a 46-10 victory. 9/1/2012 - The Cougars opened the home season with a 39-31 victory over the Pointers from Wisconsin - Stevens Point. The game started with USF taking the opening kickoff and driving for a touchdown and a quick 7-0 lead. The Pointers responded with a field goal, and Saint Francis added another first quarter score to reach the first break with a 13-3 lead. What began to look like a rout quickly changed as Stevens Point scored 3 straight second half touchdowns to take their biggest lead, 24-13. A late Cougar touchdown moved the halftime score to 24-19 in favor of the Pointers. The Cougars made some adjustments in the locker room, and they dominated the second half of play. They scored 4 unanswered touchdowns to regain and extend the lead to 39-24 before a late Pointers TD put the final points on the scoreboard. The second half comeback was led by 3rd string quarterback Wes Hunsucker (David Yoder was recovering from injury) after starter Josh Miller sat out due to dizziness reported after the first half of play. 9/8/2012 - The home season continued with a non-conference game against MSFA rival Saint Ambrose. It was an uncharacteristic defensive contest as all 8 quarters resulted in less than 10 points being scored by the respective teams. As was the case in week 1, the Cougars won the coin toss and took possession of the football. Their first drive culminated in a touchdown. After an unsuccessful kick attempt, they led 6-0. Saint Ambrose then took the ensuing kick-off and marched downfield with similar precision. When the drive stalled, they kicked a field goal on 4th down. But the kick was never counted because a USF player ran into the kicker for a penalty that kept the SAU drive alive. They got the ultimate finish, a touchdown. After a successful kick, the Cougars trailed 7-6 at the end of the first quarter. There was no scoring in either the second or third quarters. In the 4th quarter, the Cougars made a quarterback change, bringing Wes Hunsucker into the game. He got immediate results. His second play from scrimmage was a 10-yard pass to Austin Coleman, who raced down the right sidelines evading a handful of SAU players on his way to a 70-yard TD. The following 2-point conversion was equally exciting as RB Antoin Campbell did a high jump-like leap over two defenders to reach the endzone. The 2 points extended the USF lead to 14-7. But SAU responded with a late touchdown of their own, and a successful 2-point conversion sealed their first victory in the history of games between the two. 9/22/2012 - After a week off, after a loss two weeks ago, the Cougars returned to the field for a game filled with notable happenings. The 7:00pm marked the start of the first home night game in USF history. The Homecoming game's outcome was never in doubt once the Cougars started putting points on the board. Soon after the offense scored to give USF a 7-0 lead, the defense contributed immediately. On the next series of plays by Concordia, a pass was intercepted and run back to extend the score to 24-0. The Cougars never looked back as they continued putting points on the board. The final score of 76-14 represented the third-highest score in USF history, and the most points scored since 2002. The victory was win #257 for Coach Kevin Donley. Coupled with a loss by Dickinson State (and coach Hank Biesiot), the win broke a 3-way tie and placed Coach Donley solely atop the leader ladder of most wins all-time by a NAIA coach. The win record was formerly held by Frosty Westering. 9/29/2012 - This week's opponent was defending NAIA national champion Saint Xavier. The StX team was undefeated and ranked #1 in the current year's polls, and USF had not beaten them in the past four contests between the two. In addition, it was Homecoming weekend for Saint Xavier. But USF was prepared for the occasion and returned to Fort Wayne with an upset victory, defeating the Saint Xavier team 25-13. It was the first time that USF had defeated a #1-ranked team, in a game that will forever remain one of the program's great accomplishments. The Cougars are idle next week before hitting the road again to visit a pair of Top 10-ranked teams the following two Saturdays. As a result of the upset, Saint Xavier dropped to 6th in the NAIA Coaches' Weekly Poll, and USF climbed to 7th. 10/13/2012 - The Cougars had the improbable task of facing the #1 ranked team in the nation for the second consecutive game with their visit to Marian. Once again, the Cougars fought hard; but the outcome was a 45-38 loss in the high- scoring game. Time ran out as the Cougars were driving for a game-tying score. With the loss, the Cougars dropped 2 places to #9. Next week, USF continues their tough road schedule with a visit to #5 William Penn. 10/20/2012 - For the third time in 3 games, the Cougars found themselves on the road against a team ranked in the NAIA top-5. This week's opponent was William Penn, an undefeated team that had not lost a home game in over two years. Saint Francis scored touchdowns in each of the first two quarters, and their opponents kicked two field goals - the second one as time expired in the half - to bring the score to 14-6 in favor of Saint Francis at the half. The gap was quickly closed as William Penn took the second-half's opening kickoff and returned it for a touchdown to shorten the deficit to 14-13. But just as suddenly, the Cougars took the next kickoff and ran it back for a touchdown of their own. The touchdown restored the 8-point margin to 21-13. With less than a minute off the second half clock, two touchdowns had been scored before either team's offense had touched the football. William Penn added two field goals, and USF added another touchdown to bring the score to the final margin of victory, a 28-19 upset win for Saint Francis. During the game, the Cougar's Austin Coleman set a USF record for most return yards in a single game. Including the kickoff return, Coleman returned the ball for 207 yards in the game. For the win, Saint Francis improved to #7 in the NAIA national rankings. 10/27/2012 - After being tested on the road for over a month against top-5 powerhouses, USF returned home to face a relatively new program from Siena Heights. The outcome was as expected. Saint Francis kicked a field goal on their first possession and added a touchdown on their second on their way to a 17-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. They added two more touchdowns against the Saints as the offense experimented by using two backup quarterbacks for most of the second half. Siena Heights avoided a shutout when they scored on their final possession of the game, with less than a minute left on the clock. The final score of this conference game was a victory for USF, 31-7. Next week, USF faces their final conference foe of the season when it hosts Taylor. 11/3/2012 - The offense sputtered, but the defense played well enough to create a victory and a share of the MSFA Midwest League title. In their final conference game of the season, USF prevailed 21-0 over Taylor University. The defensive effort included 4 interceptions: one was returned for a touchdown, and two were made at the goal line to halt Taylor scoring drives. In addition, the defense posted a goal line stance that prevented a Taylor score with a first and goal from inside the 5-yard line. The offense scored two touchdowns, each resulting from Taylor punt miscues that gave the Cougars the ball deep inside Taylor territory. The first score came shortly after a Taylor snap that sailed over the punter's head, and the second came when USF blocked a punt attempt. All scoring occurred in the first half; in a rare occurrence, USF was forced to punt the ball on all five possessions in the second half. Combined with a Marian home loss to Saint Xavier, the victory gave all 3 teams one conference loss on the season and a share of the conference championship. The conference automatic bid to the postseason playoffs will go to the team finishing with highest rating in the final regular season polls; the other two teams will presumably receive at-large berths into the tournament. 11/10/2012 - The Cougars completed their regular season with a 44-7 road win with a visit to another first year football program, Lindenwood (IL). With starting QB Josh Miller on the sidelines nursing an ankle injury, backup David Yoder led the offense for most of the game. Third-stringer Wes Hunsaker came in to take several snaps near the end of the game. The final regular season rankings and the postseason draw will be released tomorrow to show the Cougars' path through the postseason. 11/17/2012 - Before the game, a fan seated behind me was overheard to employ an unusual method of predicting the final outcome. USF was ranked #6; Baker was ranked #11. Therefore, USF would win by 5. Scientific or not, the fan's prediction proved to be prophetic as USF prevailed in the contest by a final score of 22-17. The game's outcome was largely determined by a USF defense that would bend but not break. After winning the opening coin flip, Baker elected to receive. Saint Francis kicked the ball into the endzone, and Baker started at their own 25 after the touchback. A few plays later, the defense responded with the first interception of the game, and USF took over deep in Baker territory. The turnover led to the first score of the game, an 11-yard pass to give the Cougars a 6-0 lead. No other scores were logged in the first quarter. In the second quarter, USF tacked on a field goal after the defense forced and recovered a Baker fumble. It was the first of 3 on the day for the Cougar placekicker, tying the school's record for most field goals in one game. Baker took the ensuing kickoff and marched in for their first score of the game, narrowing the USF lead to 9-7. USF then took over on offense and produced their best sustained drive of the game. With 33 seconds left in the first half, the Cougars’ quarterback scored on a 13-yard scamper into the end zone to bring the score to 16-7. Not to be outdone, Baker took the following kickoff and marched close enough to kick a field goal with 10 seconds left to bring the halftime score to 16-10 in favor of Saint Francis The third quarter was a back-and-forth defensive struggle, and neither team scored. The fourth quarter saw Saint Francis convert their second field goal. But Baker took the kickoff and marched the length of the field, scoring another touchdown that narrowed the gap to 19-17 in favor of the home team. USF responded by kicking their third field goal, extending the margin to 5, with 3:44 left in the game. The outcome of the game was uncertain until USF intercepted a Baker pass with 2:33 left in the game. After that, Saint Francis ran out the clock with Baker having only two timeouts to halt the runoff. On the day, the USF defense captured 4 Baker turnovers, 2 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries. Although the Baker offense outgained the Cougars, the Cougar defense came through with big plays to stop Baker's momentum most of the time. The win was the 17th consecutive home playoff win for USF, who has not lost a home game in their entire playoff history. 11/24/2012 - These two teams met earlier in a regular season game at the same field, and the outcome of this one was very similar to the earlier match. Saint Francis played an inspired game; but in the end, the Cougars were no match for the offensive efficiency that was displayed by the Marian Knights. Saint Francis received the opening kickoff and sustained a drive that resulted in a score and a 7-0 lead. They kicked the ball to Marian, who lost possession when a downfield bomb was intercepted by the USF defender. At that point the Cougars were in control, but the momentum eventually shifted and stayed with Marian for the remainder of the game. Marian scored with about 3 minutes left on the clock, and the first quarter ended tied, 7-7. An efficient passing game and the ability to maintain control of the ball were two of Marian's biggest assets. Marian's offense kept the ball for about 11 minutes in the second quarter, producing a field goal and a late touchdown to bring the halftime score to 17-7 in favor of the Knights. The third quarter opened with Marian returning to offense. But the Cougars’ defense held, and the Knights kicked the ball. The Cougars misplayed the punt, and Marian recovered the ball. That drive ended with a USF interception. But the Cougars’ offense failed to move the chains in 3 plays, and a USF punt sent the ball to Marian's 11-yard line. Marian went 3-and-out, and USF was set to receive the ball once again. A poor punt never made it to the midfield line, giving USF great field position. Unfortunately, a Cougars defensive player ran into the kicker, and that penalty allowed Marian to retain possession of the football. The error proved costly as Marian drove the ball for a touchdown that extended the lead to 24-7. USF took the kick and marched for a touchdown of their own to move the score to 24-14. The Knights immediately countered by returning the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. After a missed extra point, the quarter ended with Marian leading 30-14. Early in the 4th quarter, USF drove for a touchdown to bring the lead back to 30-21. The Cougars played good defense, and Marian punted the ball back to the Cougars. But the next possession saw two dropped passes before the third attempt was intercepted by the Knights. Most of the rest of the quarter was burned up by Marian's offense, who held the ball for nearly 12 minutes of the period. Marian marched for a score, and a 2-point conversion extended their lead to 38-21. The next kick was immediately returned for a 100-yard touchdown return by the Cougars’ Austin Coleman. For Coleman, the touchdown return was the 8th in his career, setting a new NAIA record for most touchdowns on returns in a career. Marian again took over on offense, and they drove the ball for their final points of the game, making the score 45-28. A late Cougars’ touchdown with 12 seconds left on the clock brought about the final score of 45-34 after the Cougars failed to convert a 2-point pass attempt.

He also finished third in the 2017 Kentucky Derby before winning the Affirmed Stakes and Shared Belief Stakes that year. Briefly retired to stud in 2018, he proved sub-fertile and was returned to racing that summer. In his second career, he won several stakes races including the Native Diver and San Pasqual. He was euthanized on February 23, 2019, after suffering a severe fracture to the hind pastern while in training for his next race.  Background  Battle of Midway was a bay horse bred by Thor-Bred Stables, owned by Erik and Pavla Nygaard, and was foaled at Chesapeake Farm in Kentucky. His sire Smart Strike was a Canadian Hall Of Fame racehorse and notable sire who also sired Preakness Stakes winner Lookin at Lucky, Hall of Fame inductee Curlin, and Breeders Cup Turf winner English Channel. Battle of Midway's dam Rigoletta won the G1 Oak Leaf Stakes as a two-year-old. While in foal with Battle of Midway, Rigoletta developed a foot abscess that led to a serious coffin bone infection. Rigoletta eventually recovered and Battle of Midway thrived, developing a reputation as \\"the biggest and the strongest\\" foal at the farm. He was bought at the 2015 Fasig-Tipton New York Saratoga Sale for $410,000 on behalf of Rick Porter's Fox Hill Farm. Porter named the colt after the pivotal naval engagement of World War II. Battle of Midway was privately sold after his second place finish in the Santa Anita Derby to Don Alberto Stable and WinStar Farm. He was trained by Jerry Hollendorfer.  Racing career  = 2017: three-year-old season = Battle of Midway was unraced as a two-year-old, instead making his debut in a six furlong maiden special weight race for three-year-olds at Santa Anita Park on January 21, 2017. Sent off as the 7-2 third choice, he dueled with Bronze Age before that rival weakened in the stretch run. Battle of Midway then drew away to a length victory under jockey Drayden van Dyke. In his next race, Battle of Midway stepped up sharply in class for the Grade 2 San Vicente Stakes, also at Santa Anita, ultimately finishing third to Iliad. With that loss, he made his next start in an allowance optional claiming race at Santa Anita on March 9. Similar to the San Vicente, he started fifth and was almost three lengths behind at the end of the first quarter-mile while being carried wide around the first turn. He rated in fourth down the backstretch, then started his move on the final turn, again carried wide. He took over the lead at the head of the stretch, then held of a late run by Reach the World to win by a neck. Battle of Midway returned to stakes company in the Grade I Santa Anita Derby on April 8, part of a field of thirteen that included stakes winners Iliad (San Vincente), Gormley (FrontRunner) and Royal Mo (Robert B. Lewis). Battle of Midway broke well and battled for the lead with American Anthem and Royal Mo. Around the far turn, American Anthem faded while Battle of Midway moved to the lead. Gormley started closing ground from further pack and gradually moved by Battle of Midway, who lost by half a length. The second-place finish gave the colt 40 points on the Road to the Kentucky Derby, enough to qualify for the race. He trained well at Santa Anita in the weeks leading up to the 2017 Kentucky Derby, then was shipped to Churchill Downs shortly before the race. The highly competitive field of 20 included Always Dreaming (Florida Derby), Thunder Snow (UAE Derby), Girvin (Louisiana Derby), Gunnevera, Classic Empire (Breeders' Cup Juvenile), Tapwrit, Irish War Cry (Wood Memorial) and Gormley. Battle of Midway was widely dismissed at odds of 40-1. On a muddy track, Battle of Midway broke well and avoided traffic problems that took out several leading contenders. He rated behind State of Honor and Always Dreaming with Irish War Cry to his outside. Moving around the final turn, Always Dreaming took control of the race while Battle of Midway also made his move while being pushed wide. In the stretch, Lookin at Lee made a late run to move into second, with Battle of Midway finishing third. His connections opted to skip the rest of the Triple Crown series, instead returning Battle of Midway to California and giving him some time off. On June 24, he entered the Affirmed Stakes as the 1-9 favorite. He broke sharply and took the lead by half a length. Around the turn, B Squared moved alongside but Battle of Midway powered back and opened up to win by lengths. \\"We didn't go super fast the first part,\\" said jockey Flavien Prat. \\"I think it's better (for him) to run at a target and a good pace, but we were comfortable on the lead and he did a great job.\\" Battle of Midway was then shipped across the country for the Haskell Invitational Stakes at Monmouth Park on July 30. He hesitated at the break and brushed against the gate, then rushed up to the lead with Irish War Cry and Timeline. However, he flattened off in the stretch and finished sixth behind Girvin. He made his debut at Del Mar in his next start, the Shared Belief Stakes on August 26. Under the allowance conditions of the race, he carried top weight of 124 pounds along with Gormley and Cistron. Wearing blinkers for the first time, he stalked the early pace set by Cistron and Gato Del Oro. Moving around the far turn, he made a strong move to take the lead, then continued to draw away down the stretch to win by lengths. In his next start, he headed to Remington Park in Oklahoma for the Oklahoma Derby on September 24. Battle of Midway started in between horses and was \\"pin balled around\\", dropping back to fifth. He made a huge move turning into the stretch to take the lead but tired and was passed by Untrapped to finish second. Despite the loss, Battle of Midway made his fourth attempt at a Grade 1 in the Breeders Cup Dirt Mile on November 3. He faced a deep field that included three horses who were already Grade I winners – H Allen Jerkins winner Practical Joke, Met Mile winner Mor Spirit, and Gold Cup Winner Cupid. Multiple graded stakes winners Accelerate and Sharp Azteca were also given serious consideration by the bettors. The odds on Battle of Midway drifted out from 10-1 on the morning line to 14-1 at post time. At the start, Battle of Midway settled a few lengths behind the early leaders while moving four wide around the first turn. Jockey Flavien Prat noted that the colt was relaxed moving down the backstretch and kept him out of traffic problems, moving five wide around the final turn. He started his closing drive on the turn and by the top of the stretch had moved into second behind pacesetter Sharp Azteca. Battle of Midway had the momentum but Sharp Azteca continued to fight back. Battle of Midway also dug in and prevailed by half a length at the wire. He finished the year with a record of five wins, two seconds and two thirds from 10 starts. = 2018: Brief retirement and four-year-old season = Battle of Midway was retired to stud at WinStar Farm for the 2018 breeding season for a fee of $20,000 live foal. Despite covering 60 (or 61 depending on the source) mares during the 2018 season, he was only able to get five of them in foal because he is missing a gene that impacts his sperm's ability to fertilize eggs. Battle of Midway's owners elected to take a subfertility insurance payout and put him back into race training, sending him temporarily to the barn of Rodolphe Brisset at Keeneland. He eventually returned to the care of Jerry Hollendorfer, his original trainer. Battle of Midway returned to racing in the Grade II Pat O'Brien Stakes at Del Mar on August 25 over a distance of seven furlongs. He bobbled at the start and then settled into fourth place. He closed ground late to finish second, but was well beaten by heavy favorite Catalina Cruiser. Based on that performance, Battle of Midway went off as the even money favorite in the Kelso Handicap at Belmont Park on September 22. Starting from post position one, he rated in third place and then swung wide turning into the stretch, bumping lightly with another horse. He lacked his normal closing kick and finished fifth. Hollendorfer then dropped Battle of Midway down in class by entering him in the listed Comma to the Top Stakes at Santa Anita on October 28 at his best distance of one mile. His jockey, Flavien Prat, placed him on the outside of the pack, then released him with two furlongs remaining. Battle of Midway drew away to win by lengths. \\"He's got a lot of natural speed, and he settled very nice,\\" said Prat. \\"He's a very classy horse, and the two turns probably helped him today.\\" On November 25, Battle of Midway was entered in the Native Diver Stakes at Del Mar. In a field of three, Isotherm fought his rider and eventually dropped out of competition, turning the contest into a match race between Battle of Midway and Dabster. The two battled around the track, never separated by more than half a length, with Dabster taking the lead briefly after half a mile. Battle of Midway responded to the challenge and prevailed by a neck. Hollendorfer remarked, \\"[Dabster's jockey] rode a good tactic trying to beat us, but he showed some guts. Sometimes they have to. In the end we were a neck ahead, and that worked out for us.\\" Battle of Midway made his final start of 2018 in the San Antonio Stakes on December 26, opening day of Santa Anita's winter spring meet. He and Dabster once again vied for the early lead and were still in command at the top of stretch before being passed by Gift Box. Battle of Midway held on for second, lengths clear of Dabster. He finished the season with a record of two wins and two seconds from five starts. = 2019: Five-year-old season = Battle of Midway kicked off his 2019 campaign with a win in the San Pasqual Stakes on February 2 over a distance of miles. Breaking from the outside post in a field of five, he rated behind his main rival, Grade I winner McKinzie. As they exited the backstretch, McKinzie started his move and joined early pace setter Giant Expectations. Battle of Midway, under mild urging from Flavien Prat, followed suit and the three horses dueled around the final turn. At the head of the stretch, Giant Expectations gave way and Battle of Midway moved to the lead. McKinzie continued to battle down the stretch with Battle of Midway prevailing by half a length. \\"I think the key was being outside,\\" said Prat. \\"I don't think either horse likes to get pressure inside, and I was able to stay just outside of McKinzie the whole way. My horse likes to play around a little when he makes the lead, but he still finished good.\\" Seven days later, Battle of Midway became a father as his first foal (sired before he went back from breeding to racing in 2018) was born, a filly out of La Boheme, by Giant's Causeway. On February 23, Battle of Midway shattered his pastern in a hind leg during training for an upcoming race. The injuries were so severe that he had to be euthanized. At the time of Battle of Midway's death, three of his five foals had been born, with the fourth coming one day later.

Later, he translated it into Flemish in 1581 with the title Kruydtboeck. This was l'Obel's second work, following publication of the Stirpium adversaria nova in London in 1570. This work was intended as a companion publication to his Stirpium adversaria nova, and incorporates a revised version of the latter, as Nova stirpium adversaria.  History  L'Obel's first work was the Stirpium aduersaria noua, published in London in 1571. The Plantarum seu stirpium historia of 1576 was intended as a companion piece, and was published in conjunction with a re-issue of Stirpium aduersaria noua, as Nova stirpium adversaria In 1571 l'Obel published his Flemish translation of Plantarum, as Kruydtboeck (Herb book), and in 1605 he reissued the Stirpium. The Plantarum deals with several subjects, including descriptions and illustrations (more than 2,000) of plants known to l'Obel, with plant names given in Latin, German, English, French, Flemish, Italian, and Spanish. It also includes a history of botany and the use of plants in treating diseases. It was published by Christophe Plantin, whose workshop handled most of the major botanical works of the period and accumulated a large stock of woodcuts which were recycled between all these publications. The work is notable as one of the earliest attempts to classify plants by their natural characteristics rather than medicinal properties.  Structure  The initial section is the new Stirpium observations (671 pages), which is liberally illustrated, followed by the revised Nova stirpium adversarial. The former contains 1,473 woodcuts. While many of these were reused from other botanical works, about half were original to this publication. In addition to the Nova stirpium, the work includes a work by Guillaume Rondolet, Lobel's mentor at the University of Montpellier.

History The bill was introduced in the 115th United States Congress by Richard Hudson, a North Carolina Republican in the United States House of Representatives, on January 3, 2017. Hudson is the bill's chief sponsor, but the bill has over 200 co-sponsors as well. On November 29, the House Judiciary Committee voted 19-11 to advance the bill to the floor of the House for a vote. Congressional Democrats had proposed multiple amendments to the bill, all of which were voted down by Republicans. The bill is intended to be combined with another, bipartisan bill aimed at improving the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. On December 6, the House passed the bill 231-198. Responses The National Rifle Association praised the bill, writing on its website that \\"This would end abuses in anti-gun states like California, New York and New Jersey and allow law-abiding concealed carriers to exercise their rights nationwide with peace of mind\\". Democrats have criticized the bill, claiming, among other things, that it would infringe on states' rights and adversely affect public safety. Gun control advocates such as Sara Gorman have also criticized the bill, stating that it would be dangerous for victims of domestic abuse because it would allow people to circumvent background checks for guns or permits by obtaining them in more permissive states. On Feb. 11, 2018, it was reported that President Donald Trump \\"fully\\" supported the bill, but on Feb. 27 it was reported that Trump instead preferred Texas Sen. John Cornyn's \\"Fix NICS Act\\" that included stronger background checks. Trump signed \\"Fix NICS\\" on March 23, 2018.

The TTRA was introduced on February 9, 1989 at the 101st Congress, 1989-1990, and was enacted when signed by President George H. W. Bush on November 28, 1990. as law (Pub.L. 101-626). Refer to the GovTrack.us website for the extended text of the bill. For a bill to become law in the United States it must be approved by both the House and the Senate, and signed by the President, who can veto the bill if they chose to. In response to required adjustments to the initial bill, a conference committee was formed, consisting of members from both the House and the Senate, tasked to produce a conference report on the necessary revisions and changes. This revised version of the bill was passed by both the Senate (Oct. 24 1990), with a vote of 99-0, and was approved by the House (Oct. 26, 1990). The sponsor for this bill was a representative from New York's 3rd congressional district, Robert Mrazek (Democrat). Forest Service map of the Tongass, with National Monuments and Wilderness Areas  Background  The Tongass has been recognized by some as the largest, wettest, and wildest of the United States National Forests, with \\"soaring mountain peaks, narrow fjords, lush woods, and more than 1000 named islands.\\" The Tongass encompasses most of Southeast Alaska, and was created in 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt. With high concentrations of grizzly bears and bald eagles, this forest provides a haven for a diversity of wildlife. For the commercially important industry of salmon fishing, the Tongass plays an important role as well, as 90% of salmon in Southeast Alaska spawn within the territory of the Tongass National Forest. It has become a growing destination for passing tourists, and supports a traditional subsistence lifestyle for many communities. John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, and by many seen as the grandfather of the American National Parks, called the Tongass a place of \\"endless rhythm and beauty. Between 1954 and 1990 approximately 70% of the productive old-growth had been harvested. Prior to the enactment of the TTRA, clear cut logging of old-growth still took place in the Tongass National Forest, the only forest in the US where this method of forest management still existed. Continuation of similar rates of deforestation would have led to a large reduction in suitable habitat of the Sitka black-tailed deer, an important resource for subsistence hunting. Projections for the forest calculated prior to the TTRA, estimated that the timber harvests of the Tongass, and its consequential impacts on future employment, did not yield promising results for the logging industry. Disruptions were forecasted to local communities and a gross decline in profitable timber if the management approach by the Forest Service was not changed. = ANILCA = Signed in on November 12th 1980 by President Carter, ANILCA exempted the Tongass National Forest from complying to the provisions of section 6 (k) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976. This opened the Tongass to logging contracts that would have otherwise been unprofitable. Under In section 705 (a) of ANILCA, The Forest Service was legally required to make 4.5 billion board feet of the raw wood available to timber harvesting, on a decadal cycle. This resulted in the removal of market demands of timber, eliminating economic competition for those companies that held a contract with the Forest Service the timber industry. Because of this guarantee, any fluctuations in market demands of timber would be inconsequential in determining how much timber the pulp companies were able to harvest and sell. The recorded public response to ANILCA was an opinion that the United States government was engaging in \\"senseless deforestation.\\" From 1982 to 1988, it was estimated that roughly $386,003,000 was spent by the United States federal government on the preparation and sale of the Tongass Forest timber. This sum was calculated by the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council (SEACC). The receipts of the timber sales for that period that the federal government released, total $32,427,432, resulting in an approximate net loss of $353,575,568 for the national treasury. There are disputes as to the specific costs that the federal government carried in incentivizing industrial production in the Tongass National Forest. None of the calculations could reveal a positive return to the US national treasury from the timber harvest of the Tongass National Forest. = Pulp Contracts = Many companies entered into timber contracts in Southeast Alaska during the post-World War II boom, however only two contracts remained by the time the TTRA was passed. In 1951 the United States federal government signed a contract with the Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC) to authorize the harvest of 8.25 billion board feet of timber within a 50-year period from the Tongass National Forest. The second contract was between the Alaska Pulp Corporation (APC) and the United States, signed in 1956, authorizing the harvest of 4.975 billion board feet for the next fifty years. Both mills have been key to local economy, and were for a time the largest employer in Southeast Alaska. The funding by the United States government of the timber industry was intended as a strategy to increase the population of Southeast Alaska by creating more employment opportunities. About half the timber harvest was used primarily to produce dissolvable pulp, a raw material used in the production of rayon and cellophane. These long-term contract holders pay a much lower stumpage fee for the Tongass timber, than standard businesses holding short-term timber contracts. The logging mills have been able to make a profit from the Tongass timber, due to the subsidies provided by the federal government. = Support for the TTRA = The existence of the TTRA is in part due to specific Southeast Alaskans lobbying Congress in Washington D.C. Another important player in the creation of the TTRA was the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council (SEACC). The legislation was supported by the Alaska Trollers Association, the United Southeast Gillnetters Association, the Petersburg Vessel Owners, the Southeast Seiner Boat Owners and Operators, and the United Fisherman of Alaska. All these different organizational bodies intended for the TTRA to constitute and herald a step towards rational management of the Tongass National Forest.  The TTRA in Congress  The intention of the legislation was aimed at safeguarding clean water and riparian habitats, protecting the old-growth of the Tongass National Forest, and reducing the economic strain on federal funding through the 4.5 billion board feet decadal guaranteed timber budget. Initially a large goal of the bill was to terminate the two existing long-term contracts of the KPC and APC. In the final bill this goal was amended to apply specific modifications to the existing long-term timber contracts. The hope with this Act was to eliminate a bias in favor of timber production in the Tongass, and to require the forest service to meet the needs of the other resource based industries involved in the Tongass. Initially, the following areas were proposed to receive Wilderness status: Port Houghton, Castle River, and East Kuiu Island. This was part of the original bill that passed the House in 1989, but was dropped in the final bill. The bill became a compromise between further conservation and continuing to accommodate economic growth in the region by permitting the continuation of the long-term timber contracts.  Details of Amendments  = Section 101: To require annual appropriations for timber management of the Tongass National Forest = In ANILCA section 705 (a) is replaced with: > Subject to appropriations, other applicable law, and the requirements of the > National Forest Management Act of 1976... except as provided in subsection > (d) of this section, the Secretary shall, to the extent consistent with > providing for the multiple use and sustained yield of all renewable forest > resources, seek to provide a supply of timber from the Tongass National > Forest which (1) meets the annual market demand for timber from such forest > and (2) meets the market demand from such forest for each planning cycle. This essentially subjects the Tongass National forest to the same laws and market demands as all other National Forests of the US - in the context of timber harvest, repealing the prior mandated harvest of 4.5 billion board feet per ten years and the guaranteed funding. = Section 102: Identification of Lands unsuitable for Timber Production = This amends section 705 (d) of ANILCA, limiting the Forest Service from excessively harvesting old-growth timber. = Section 103: Fisheries Protection = This amends section 705 (d) of ANILCA, which allowed leniency in designating which areas were to be open to timber harvest. This section focuses on protecting riparian ecosystems by creating a minimum 100-foot buffer on the banks of anadromous stream systems and tributaries (Class I and II streams), a buffer modeled per recommendation from the National Marine Fisheries Service. This amendment protects stream- side banks. Harvesting in these areas increases soil erosion, threatening the quality of the watershed ecosystems and the potentially harming the fish that reside in these streams. = Section 104: Future reports of the Tongass National Forest and Consultation = This is in amendment of section 706 (b) of ANILCA. Requires the Forest Service to report to congress on the impacts of timber harvest on subsistence, wildlife and fisheries habitats, while also consulting on the status reports with the Southeast Alaska commercial fishing organizations. In response to credibility issue between the Forest Service and the public, the courts and the Congress, due to conviction from the Forest Service that no matter how much timber is harvested, no adverse impacts will occur. = Section 105: Small business Set Aside Program. = This section intended to increase small business participation in the Tongass, in order to tackle the monopoly of the KPC and the APC in the timber industry. = Section 106: Tenakee Springs Road = This section prohibited the construction of further road systems that would connect the logging road of Chichagof Island to Tenakee Springs by the Forest Service, aiming to preserve the quality of Tongass. = Title III – Modification of Long-term Timber Sale Contracts in Alaska = Rather than cancel the 50 year contracts with KPC and APC, the act has amendments that applied to the current contracts, consisting of nine specific reform directives.  Implementation of the TTRA  Seen by some as the \\"most significant piece of conservation law, the TTRA created 6 new areas of wilderness totalling 296,080 acres. This means that lands are closed to logging, road construction, mine development, and to is required to be managed as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System under the Wilderness Act of 1964. During the congressional negotiations concerning the TTRA, the House wanted to eliminate the designated decadal harvest levels, terminate the long-term contracts existing with the KPC and the APC, designate more of the Tongass to wilderness status, and provide increased protection to fisheries. The Senate were hesitant to endorse the extensive reforms, concerned for the local economy of Southeast Alaska, and the Alaskans that relied on the timber industry of the Tongass for employment. The Senate were in support of the goal to improve the management of the Tongass by the Forest Service. The application of the TTRA modifications by the Forest Service did see positive changes in the management of the Tongass. However, reforms are seen to fall short of encompassing the intention and goals of Congress in passing the TTRA. An article published in a local newspaper of Juneau, mentioned that the \\"Law provision cancelled a $40 million annual subsidy for timber harvest\\" and \\"significantly reshaped the logging industry's relationship with the Tongass National Forest.\\" It was observed however that the Forest Services were resistant in adhering to the reforms set out in the TTRA on the Tongass. After the TTRA's enactment, it appeared that timber production was still the main resource on which the Forest Service focused its management, prioritizing the sale of the Tongass forest to the mills with which it held its contracts. The state of Alaska noted that the Forest service inadequately assessed the impacts on water quality due to logging, as well as avoiding assessing the adverse effects on a variety of other industries and activities that rely on the health of the Tongass National Forest. Delineating buffers around streams of Class I and II that were explicitly stipulated in section 103 of the TTRA have been carried out by the Forest Service. However, the requirements laid forth in section 103 have been inadequately enforced and interpreted in a way that reduces the intended protection. The Forest Service applied the 100-foot buffer by slope distance rather than exclusively horizontal distance. This can lead to a significant reduction in the final buffer zone afforded to the stream, particularly as the Tongass National Forest consists predominantly of steep terrain. An additional 733,482 acres were designated to Land Use Designation II, meaning that the management of these lands were to be carried out without further road construction. In 1993 the Alaska Pulp Corporation located in Sitka, closed its doors due to unprofitable business circumstances, followed shortly by the Ketchikan Pulp Company in 1997 for similar reasons.

Plot =Flashbacks= In 2009, Ingram (Brett Cullen) and Finch (Michael Emerson) discuss the fact that the Machine will be turned over to the government in a few days. Despite Finch being proud of saving \\"relevant\\" lives, Ingram seems skeptic due to the fact everyone is \\"relevant\\" to someone. Later, Ingram meets with Alicia Corwin (Elizabeth Marvel) to discuss the future of the Machine, accidentally revealing that 7 people know about the Machine. Startled, Ingram meets with Finch, asking if he has a contingency plan in case someone tries to gain control of the Machine. Finch refuses to make a plan, so Ingram decides to do it himself under the program \\"Contingency\\". =Present day= Reese (Jim Caviezel) follows Finch in an attempt to subtract information from him but he can't find anything. Later, they receive a new number: Henry Peck (Jacob Pitts), a security analyst. Reese fails to get into Peck's system in his cellphone and tries to surveillance him in his office but is denied access, discovering it's a SCIF, which makes Peck a non-official cover.

He worked with Michel Fokine who was his teacher in Stockholm. Biography Jean Börlin was held in high esteem by Michel Fokine, who will later say of the Swedish dancer \\"He is the one who looks the most like me! A natural! An ecstasy! The fanatic sacrifice of a bruised body to give the maximum of choreographic expression\\". Trained at the Royal Swedish Ballet, he joined the troupe in 1905 and was named first dancer by Fokine in 1913. He joined his master in Copenhagen in 1918, then traveled to Europe and discovered modern dance. Recommended by Fokine, he was recruited for the newly formed Ballets suédois by Rolf de Maré. This marked his first steps as a choreographer; the vast majority of Ballets suédois choreographies bear his name. He danced for the company at a time when it was in constant competition with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. From 1920, he became principal dancer, teacher, ballet master and choreographer. Hailed by the French critics, Börlin is considered the successor of Vaslav Nijinsky. Personal life Börlin and Rolf de Maré met through common friend Nils Dardel in 1918, and de Maré became lover and protector. Jean Börlin died of cancer in 1930 when he was only 37 years old. Even if he died in New York he asked to be buried back in Paris, at Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Serra created a replicate sculpture which is currently on display in the museum. History The sculpture was commissioned by the Reina Sofia Museum for the exhibition 'Referencias: Un encuentro artístico en el tiempo' (References: An artistic encounter in time), which took place between 26 May-15 September 1986. Serra was paid $200,000 for the art work, which weighed 38 tonnes. In March 1988, the sculpture was placed into storage with the company Fluiters S.A., who specialized in the storage of works of art. In November 1990, the sculpture was taken out of storage and placed back on display briefly. On 25 November 1990 the sculpture was placed back into storage with the company Macarrón S.A. According to museum documentation, the sculpture was still in the storage through the year 1992.

Haft (born November 13, 1886) was a wrestler (both professional and amateur), wrestling and boxing promoter and wrestling trainer who was a prominent promoter in the United States from the late 1910s until the 1960s, running his operations primarily from Columbus, Ohio. He founded the Midwest Wrestling Alliance and was one of the founding members of the National Wrestling Alliance in 1948. Haft's was originally the manager and booker of John Pesek, who would go on to become World Heavyweight Champion. He was also involved in amateur wrestling and was the head wrestling coach at the Ohio State University, leading \\"The Buckeyes\\" to their first team title in 1923. He also holds the Ohio State Second-Year Coaching Record to this day. Career =Professional wrestling in-ring career (1917-19)= In his early life, Haft was an in-ring competitor in professional wrestling, entering the ring in 1917 and competing under the ring name Young Gotch. He competed sporadically until 1932 but his full-time focus as an in-ring performer was short lived, deciding instead to focus on his growing success as a promoter. =The Midwest Wrestling Association and John Pesek (1920s and 1930s)= Haft began wrestling promoting in 1919. His interest in joining the professional ranks was sparked after he met John Pesek, a fellow wrestler who Haft considered the best in the world. Haft became Pesek's manager and brokered deals for him throughout the United States and abroad. In 1929, Haft sent Pesek for a wrestling tour of Australia where he came out victorious. He returned to the United States a star and soon entered the discussion of World Heavyweight Championship contenders. With Haft by his side, Pesek became the World Heavyweight Champion. In 1931, Haft created the Midwest Wrestling Association and booked a match pitting Pesek against Joe Stecher to crown the initial champion. The bout was backed by the Ohio State Athletic Commission. Pesek beat Stecher and Haft’s working relationship with Kansas and Missouri territories expanded Pesek’s star-power and booking potential. =Haft's Acre (1927)= An outdoor arena, Haft opened Haft's Acre at the southwest corner of Park Street and Goodale Boulevard in 1927 in Columbus. Boxing and wrestling were staged there until the early 1960s. Wrestlers such as Gorgeous George, Nature Boy Buddy Rogers and Wild Bull Curry all competed at the Haft events. =Founding of the National Wrestling Alliance (1948)= In 1948 Haft jointed four fellow, prominent wrestling promoters (including Pinkie George to form the National Wrestling Alliance. In September of the same year, Pinkie George was the first NWA President and Haft was elected the Vice President. The newly formed outfit was to operate talent exchanges, establish a territorial system and recognise one world champion per weight class. The NWA soon grew to become the largest body in professional wrestling, with recognised territories throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Japan. Haft's MWA World Heavyweight Champion Orville Brown defeated Otto Kuss in a match soon thereafter and was crowned the inaugural NWA World Heavyweight Champion, merging the MWA with the NWA. Towards the end of November 1949, Brown suffered injuries in an automobile accident and the promoters of the NWA met in St. Louis to recognize Lou Thesz as the World Heavyweight Champion. During this, George and Haft were also re- elected to their positions of President and Vice President. The organization remained the largest governing body in the sport until the mid-1980s national expansion of Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation.

Vegan dog food may incorporate the use of fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, nuts, vegetable oils, and soya, as well as any other non-animal based foods. The omnivorous domestic canine has evolved to metabolize carbohydrates and thrive on a diet lower in protein, and therefore, a vegan diet may be substantial if properly formulated and balanced.  Vegetarian vs. vegan diet  Vegetarianism may be defined as the practice of consuming foods that are primarily derived from plants, with or without dairy products, eggs, and/or honey. Veganism is a subset of vegetarianism, in which all animal-derived products are entirely excluded from one's lifestyle, including food, clothing, cosmetics, etc. Those who choose to practice veganism beyond vegetarianism typically do so because of moral, ethical, and animal welfare concerns. For this reason, people who practice veganism may wish to reflect their morals by having their pet maintained on a vegan diet as well.  History of plant-based dog diets  The choice to feed dogs a vegetarian diet was first introduced in a home-prepared fashion in various countries, notably India. The first commercially produced and marketed vegetarian dog food was \\"Happidog\\", based in the United Kingdom, in 1980. The Happidog brand was later changed to \\"V-dog\\" due to a trademark dispute. Since dogs are omnivores, it was recognized that they can thrive on either a meat- based or vegetarian diet. This diet choice was adapted to canines because of the ethical preferences of people who practice vegetarianism, as well as for pet owners seeking an alternative diet for pets suffering from food allergies, specifically animal protein allergies. There are many published vegetarian feeding regimens available to follow. As the popularity of this diet has grown with a corresponding increase in people practicing vegetarianism, there are various commercial vegetarian and vegan diets available on the market.  Dietary needs of the dog  The dietary requirements of dogs differ based on a variety of aspects (i.e. age, level of activity, living environment, etc.). Rather than specific ingredients, diets are formulated for their specific nutrients, so every diet prepared must have adequate levels of nutrients, including: protein, fats, carbohydrates, amino acids (methionine, lysine, arginine, etc.), vitamins (Vitamin C, B vitamins, vitamin A, etc.), and minerals (calcium, phosphorus, sodium, etc.). Many commercially available plant-based pet food diets aim to meet the fundamental nutrient requirements of various dogs. However, in a 2015 study of 26 commercial vegetarian dog diets available in the United States, 25% were found to not meet the minimum nutritional requirements as established by AAFCO.  Palatability  Studies have demonstrated that a plant-based diet can be just as edible and palatable as animal-based diets for dogs. Odiferous ingredients that enhance the smell of the food increase palatability, and examples include nutritional yeast, vegetable oil, nori (seaweed), as well as spirulina. Additionally, certain ingredients can be combined to create a palatable flavour. An example is the synergistic combination of hydrolyzed vegetable protein and xylose, as well as a combination of substances derived from glucose, garlic powder, and nature- identical, non-meat chicken flavouring. The temperature of the food can also be a factor, as warmer food has an increased palatability.  Alternative sourcing of ingredients  Due to the exclusion of animal products and by- products which are the primary ingredients of conventional dog food, many nutrients that would otherwise be provided by animal products need to be provided by replacement, plant-based ingredients. While both animal and plant products offer a wide range of macro and micronutrients, strategic formulation of plant ingredients should be considered to meet nutritional requirements as different nutrients are more abundant in different plant sources. = Primary protein = A good source of protein provides a dog with a balanced and complete profile of amino acids, and is essential for growth, muscle maintenance, and various cellular functions. Conventionally, these amino acids are primarily provided through either a singular or a combination of animal meats, meals, and by-products. A vegan diet provides the same amino acids through plants such as legumes, peas, beans, nuts, seeds and grains. While all plants contain some amount of protein, some plant sources contain more than others. However, plant sources generally do not have as complete an amino acid profile, as they are often limiting in one or more essential amino acids. Good sources of plant protein include chickpeas, green peas, soybeans, potatoes, rice, lentils, beans, and quinoa. In dog food, the protein composition can be sourced from a variety of ingredients, including grains, rice, corn, wheat, and/or barley. Soybeans, one of the most common plant-based protein sources in dog foods, provide a concentrated and complete protein source, meaning that they provide all the essential amino acids in adequate amounts. If soy is excluded for hypoallergenic purposes, chickpeas, green peas, rice, and potatoes are also common ingredients in commercial vegan dog foods. Nutritional yeast is another good source of complete protein, and can also be added to complement the amino acid profile. = Calcium = Calcium is a micronutrient that is essential for the proper mineralization of bones, teeth, and intracellular signalling. The amount of calcium required by an animal is related to many other nutrients such as phosphorus intake, as it is important to balance calcium and phosphorus levels at a ratio of 1.2–1.4:1. Protein intake is also a factor, as increased consumption of protein leads to more calcium being excreted in the urine to balance out the nitrogenous waste products of the amino acid metabolism. For humans, common food sources of calcium can be found in dairy products. However, dairy products are often not used as a conventional dog food ingredient, and therefore, calcium is typically supplemented as calcium carbonate or another compounded form. Although there are many plant ingredients that are high in calcium such as collard greens, soy, and other leafy vegetables, plants are generally high in phosphorus and relatively lower in calcium content. It is thus advised that vegan diets include a mineral source of calcium to ensure healthy functioning, and most commercial vegan formulas supplement calcium in the same manner as conventional dog food. = Vitamin D = Vitamin D is essential for proper calcium regulation and is important for bone mineralization, nerve function, immunity, and intracellular signalling. Dogs are able to synthesize and convert 7-dehydrocholesterol (provitamin form of vitamin D) to cholecalciferol (inactive form of vitamin D) following exposure to UV light from the sun. Cholecalciferol is then converted to calcidiol in the liver before further hydroxylated to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, in the kidney. However, the conversion of provitamin D to cholecalciferol is significantly lower in dogs than other mammals, and is not sufficient to maintain an adequate vitamin D status. Thus, dogs depend on dietary sources of vitamin D to meet their nutrient requirement. In the diet, there are two forms of vitamin D – cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) from mainly animal sources, and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) from plant, especially fungi sources. Although both forms have been shown to raise serum calcidiol levels, there is evidence that cholecalciferol has a greater effect on raising blood calcidiol than ergocalciferol. There is also evidence that vitamin D2 is less effective functionally than Vitamin D3 in humans and especially in cats, although similar studies have not been replicated in dogs. Vegan sources of vitamin D include ergocalciferol and synthetic or plant sources of cholecalciferol. Mushrooms are a good plant source of natural ergocalciferol, especially after being exposed to UV-B light. Cholecalciferol in vegan dog food can be synthetic or naturally derived from lichen, a non-animal source of D3. = Vitamin B12 = Vitamin B12 is the only vitamin not present in plant sources. The largest and most complex of all the vitamins, vitamin B12, is synthesized only by bacteria and some archaea species, as eukaryotes lack the enzyme. It is integral to the health and function of the nervous system, key in hematopoiesis, as well as required to synthesize methionine and catabolize propionate for energy. Grazing animals are able to obtain B12 when they ingest bits of soil with the grass, as the vitamin and B12-producing bacteria are found in the soil and attached to the roots of the plants. After ingesting the vitamin, it is stored in the muscle and liver tissues of the animal, and subsequently passed on to the next level of the food chain. As no animal is able to synthesize cobalamin endogenously, cobalamin should be fortified and supplemented in plant-based diets. While conventional dog foods have sources of B12 from their animal products (meats, organs, milk, egg, etc.), vegan dog foods meet their vitamin B12 requirement through pure supplementation. Nutritional yeast provides a good source of vitamin B12, as long as it is already fortified. = Taurine = The sulfur-containing amino acid, taurine, is primarily found in meat and dairy products and assists in the uptake of calcium into cardiac cells, thus associated with proper myocardial functioning. Taurine is considered conditionally essential for dogs because they are able to synthesize it themselves when adequate concentrations of the other sulphur containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine, are consumed. A low amount of sulphuric amino acids have been linked to decreased food intake, a negative nitrogen balance, and in growing dogs, stunted growth rate. Low levels of taurine increase the risk of developing cardiac conditions, namely dilated cardiomyopathy. Taurine deficiency can also lead to retinal degeneration, reproduction problems, gastrointestinal disease and decreased development and function of skeletal muscles and the central nervous system. Plant-based diets may contain enough methionine and cysteine to meet AAFCO standards, but these values do not include the endogenous conversion to taurine. Thus, dietary supplementation with taurine is advised, especially for dogs susceptible to or diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. Because taurine is only synthesized in animals, vegetarian and vegan products have to rely on a synthetic form. There should not be a significant difference in the bioavailability or efficacy of the taurine content in vegan foods, as most conventional food brands will also supplement their formula with synthetic taurine. = L-Carnitine = L-Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a key role in energy production, and facilitates the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria. Animals, including dogs, are able to synthesize L-carnitine from the amino acid lysine in the liver. However, carnitine synthesis may not be adequate to meet their nutritional requirements and may need a dietary source, where L-carnitine is obtained directly through diet. Sources of L-carnitine are predominantly from animals. Vegetable and plant sources have significantly lower amounts of L-carnitine compared to animal sources. There is strong evidence that L-carnitine deficiency is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, such as dilated cardiomyopathy. Consequently, it can be synthetically supplemented in dog foods. = Omega-3 fatty acids = Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are essential for proper brain and cognitive development. They also play a large role in the production of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, which has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and other inflammatory diseases. There are three types of omega-3 fatty acids; namely alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Alpha-linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid, and is the form that is most common and widespread of the omega-3 fatty acids. Vegan sources of ALA include plant oils, nuts, flaxseed (linseed), and soy. While DHA and EPA are very important and have major implications in cognition, they are not considered essential as dogs are able to synthesize them from ALA. However, the conversion rate is relatively low, and supplementation of DHA and EPA is often helpful. Sources of DHA and EPA are also generally less widespread, and although most of the market sources of these PUFAs are from fish and fish oil, they can be sourced from algae for a vegan formulation.  Potential risks of a plant-based diet in dogs  = Alkaline urine = Animal protein has a high acidic amino acid content (glutamic and aspartic acid); therefore, its nitrogenous metabolites that are excreted via the urine are acidic, making the normal range of a dog's urine pH 5–7. Plant-based protein is relatively lower in these acidifying amino acids, which can lead to urinary alkalization (pH > 7). Alkaline urine puts dogs at an increased risk of developing struvite crystals, dysuria, hematuria and obstructing the urinary tract, which can have fatal outcomes. Vitamin C, potassium chloride, DL-methionine, and cranberry (which promotes overall health of the urinary tract), as well as peas, brown rice, and lentils all promote GI health and urine acidification, and can be used to correct the alkalinity of urine. Acidifying ingredients should be used with caution because over-supplying a dog can lead to metabolic acidosis. Regular monitoring of the acidity of a dog's urine during the transition onto a plant- based diet, changes in the diet, and during periods of illness are recommended. = Homemade diets =  Inappropriate nutrient profile  There are many vegetarian and vegan recipes available but due to the extra attention creating a complete and balanced plant-based diet requires, many of these are insufficient in macrominerals such as protein, and microminerals that include vitamin D and vitamin B12. These deficiencies cannot be corrected by including specific whole food ingredients due to the volume they would have to eat to meet requirements, thus nutritional supplements are necessary. Supplements contain anywhere from 0–300% of the vitamins and/or mineral amount required daily when the suggested dose is followed. Some ingredient inclusions can also be detrimental to a canine's overall health. Onion and garlic are often included in homemade recipes regardless of their association with hemolytic anemia in dogs. Current recommendations are that all formulations and supplementation of alternative dog diets are made by a veterinary nutritionist.  Deviation from recipe instructions  Obtaining precision and accuracy when following a recipe for plant-based diets is essential. Ingredient substitutions made over time due to affordability, availability, and owner and pet preferences, increase the risk of inadequacy. Each ingredient has a specific purpose of inclusion in a recipe; thus, substitutions may not be appropriate, especially if the diet was created for a medical condition. There are many ingredients that have been associated with disease pathologies in dogs and should not be added to a diet. To name a few, raisins, grapes, and sultanas have been associated with renal failure. Members of the allium family, including onion, garlic, shallots, and leeks are linked to the development of hemolytic anemia, and chocolate is associated with cardiac abnormalities and pancreatitis. A veterinary nutritionist can make suitable suggestions on altering existing recipes if concerns arise.  Inadequate feeding recommendations  Feeding instructions for homemade diets often lack clarity. Improper or excluded caloric information and body weight recommendations increase the risk of energy over-consumption leading to obesity. Dogs can also be undernourished and develop deficiency symptoms. Vague feeding guidelines can contribute to poor weight management because ideal body weight values are not communicated to the consumer.  Processing  Processing is an important determinant of what nutrients a dog is actually able to digest and absorb. Plant-based ingredients can be very difficult to break down without proper enzymes in the animal’s digestive tract to do this. Processing has the ability to break down nutrients such as insoluble fiber and protein that can aid in the digestibility of the ingredients and ensure the dog is utilizing the nutrients given to meet its requirements. However, processing can cause negative effects to these traits as well. = Processing of kibble – extrusion process = Production of dog food kibble is done through a process known as food extrusion. Extrusion is a process commonly used in the pet food industry to develop a product that is porous or \\"puffed\\" from expansion of pet-safe ingredients. Food extrusion is the process of which high pressure and heat are used to both shape and evenly distribute feed ingredients.  Ingredients used  Dog food ingredients typically contain farinaceous (starch) and proteinaceous (protein) ingredients. Farinaceous ingredients commonly found in United States dog feed are wheat, wheat middlings, oats, barley, corn, corn meal, hominy and other similar ingredients that account for roughly 35% to 70% of the total feed weight.Pitchon, E. (1980). United States Patent No. 4225630. Flushing, New York:United States Patent Office. Proteinaceous ingredients for vegetarian dog diets are typically from vegetables. Proteinaceous ingredients used in United States dog food typically take up 20 to 50% of the total weight of the feed mixture. Additional flavouring, colours, vitamin and mineral supplementation is added to complete a balanced dog food diet. Fat, from plant oils, is normally used to add both taste and texture to vegetarian dog diets in the United States. = Processing of canned vegetarian dog diets = Supplementing with canned food is one way to add palatability and water content to a dog's diet. Dog canned food comes in two forms in the United States: stew style and pâté style, which can vary in moisture content.Baker, G.J., Bansal, A.K., Konieczka, J.L. and Kuntz, D.A. (1990). United States Patent No. 4895731 Canned meat and gravy pet food and process. Chicago, Illinois:United States Patent Office. The desired type of wet food produced will determine the process needed for the development of the final product. The steps to producing a canned product involves the canning process followed by retorting seen in United States procedures.  Development of a replacement meat product  Most dogs prefer a meal that is rich in protein, normally from animal sources. However, with vegetarian and vegan diets in the United States, this appealing taste is mimicked using plant-based ingredients.Horrocks, D., Buckley, K. and Booth, P. (1975). United States Patent No. 3898345 Method for preparing meat-like protein food. London, England: United States Patent Office. In the United States, artificial fibers from edible vegetable protein are formed into bundles using an edible form of binding agent. This is then added to the diet mixture to form the appearance and texture of muscle meat fibers. To make this bundle more resistant to the strain of processing, a protective layer consisting of starch, gelatine powder, gelatine jelly, collagen flour, or gums is used. There should be between 0.1 and 30% of this layer coating the fiber bundles by its weight. When real meat is used in canned food processing, it maintains its form while still having a readily collapsible structure when under pressure. The technique of using bundle fibers mimics this characteristic that is appealing to pet owners. Protein fibers used should be 0.5 to 5mm thick with a ratio of fiber to emulsion that is between 80 parts fiber per 20 parts emulsion to 15 parts fiber per 85 parts emulsion. Carrageenan, fats, and other non-protein materials can be used to extend fibers. The emulsion may consist of agar, carrageenan, gelatin, carob gum, and edible ionic polymeric material such as sodium carrageenate, sodium polypectate, sodium caseinate, and sodium alginate = Nutritional aspects of processing = Processing has both beneficial and detrimental effects on feed ingredients as it applies high levels of heat, and with extrusion, pressure with reduction of moisture content.  Protein  High heat has the effect of denaturing proteins as well as inactivating anti-nutritional factors that decrease digestive abilities. With these characteristics, protein becomes more easily digestible in products that have been processed compared to those that have not. Specifically for vegetable protein, an increase in its nutritional value is seen due to this improved digestibility. In raw plant ingredients, enzyme attachment sites are more readily available when heat and pressure is used to inactivate enzyme inhibitors. On the other hand, some amino acids can be lost with heat. Lysine, both a reactive and an essential amino acid, has low retention during processing. Loss of lysine also decreases digestible protein and thus, is thought to be a sign of protein damage in extrudates. Other amino acids such as cysteine, arginine, histidine, and aspartic acid have been known to decrease in availability due to the low moisture content during processing.  Carbohydrate  During the extrusion process, sucrose is converted to reducing sugars that can be lost from Maillard reactions. Therefore, it is often seen that sugar amounts are decreased at this time. Oligosaccharides, such as raffinose and stachyose, impair nutrient utilization of grains. In the extrusion process there is a destruction of oligosaccharides that prevent flatulence and thus improves utilization of legumes used in the feed. Gelatinization of starches is a required step in extruding foods in order to form the desired porous appearance. This step allows enzymes to react with starch and increase starch breakdown.  Fiber  Processing increases water solubility of fiber by reducing the molecular weight of starch molecules like hemicellulose and pectin. This conversion of insoluble to soluble fiber increases the total dietary soluble fiber amounts in the feed mixture by making fiber more susceptible to absorption.  Lipids  Levels of 6 to 8% fat used in the extrusion process are not advised, as it limits the product's ability to expand. This is because fat causes poor pressure levels in the barrel due to more traction. If high fat ingredients are used, some free oil may be lost when product goes through the diet. Food processing can increase the nutritional quality of the product by minimizing lipid oxidation.  Vitamins  Increasing temperatures, pressure, and screw speed from extrusion affects retention of vitamins such as β-carotene, thiamine, ascorbic acid and vitamin A. The lower amounts of moisture and variability in die diameter have been also known to cause this effect. It is recommended to add additional amounts of vitamins into the mixture before processing to counterbalance the loss of vitamins during this process.  Minerals  Macromolecules are primarily affected during processing compared to molecules of a smaller size. Processing reduces various anti-nutritional factors that would otherwise impair absorption, which in turn improves the overall absorption of minerals. * See also * Dog food * List of vegetarian and vegan companies * Vegepet References Dog nutrition Vegetarianism Vegan pet food brands Dog food brands ","title":"Vegetarian and vegan dog diet"},{"id":"55970083","text":"Northwest Airlines Flight 5 was a regularly scheduled, multiple stop flight from Chicago Municipal Airport to Boeing Field, Seattle.

Hosts and symptoms The host range of P. euvitis includes the plant species Meliosma species (Meliosmaceae) and Vitis species (Vitaceae). =Meliosma species (Meliosmaceae)= The symptoms of P. euvitis consist of pale yellowish lesions on the surface of leaves on Meliosma spp. leaves. Signs include the observed on the underside of the leaf, which are tiny orange-brown dots that are actually spermagonia. Over time, they all eventually turn to a blackish color and undergo plasmogomy developing into aecium. The aecium formed can be observed on the underside of the leaves as a yellow, orange colored dome shaped structure. =Vitis species (Vitaceae)= Symptoms include powdery orange masses on the lower surface of leaves. They often mature into a long columnar shape retaining the same color.Chalkley, D. Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory, ARS, UDA. Invasive Fungi. Grape leaf rust –Phakospora euvitis. Retrieved October 23, 2017, from /sbmlweb/fungi/index.cfm. The uredinial-telial stages of P. euvitis causes chlorotic and necrotic lesions ranging in shapes and sizes on the upper surface of leaves. Signs can be seen to those corresponding to areas on the lower surface of the leaves that have densely packaged pustules containing yellow, orange spores. Premature defoliation and dormancy of the telia can occur. In the case of dormancy, telia are formed after uredinia characterized as crust-like and an orange- brown color that form around uredinia or separately from them that eventually become a dark brown-blackish color. Disease cycle Phakopsora euvitis is able to persist year-round by the production of urediniospores and infection of Vitis plants. If the alternate host M. myriantha is not present, the uredinia of P. euvitis will only be present. This disease cycle includes the alternate host. Teliospores on the grapevines germinate and produce thin- walled basidiospores that are carried by wind or other methods of dispersal to leaves or parts of the plant tissues of M. myriantha (alternate host). After 7–15 days the basidiospores will produce spermagonia. Production of asexual spores in aecia will also occur on the surfaces of the leaves after another 7–14 days.Ono Y (2000) Taxonomy of the Phakopsora ampelopsidis species complex on vitaceous hosts in Asia including a new species, P. euvitis. Mycologia 92:154–173. Those aecia will then produce aeciospores. The aeciospores are dispersed to Vitis spp., which is the telial host of this rust fungus. Infected grape leaves give rise to uredinia and disperse urediniospores, usually by wind, back to the aecial host M. myriantha. Later in the season teleia develop near uredinia on the leaf. This allows for the fungus to overwinter as telia, or in some regions persist solely in the uredinial state without a need for an alternate host.Leu, LS (1988) Rust In: Pearson RC, Goheen AC (eds) Compendium of grape diseases.

Originally known as the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad (C&M;), it was chartered in 1848. Construction of the line began in 1853 and was completed in 1857. After an 1872 merger with two small railroads, the corporate name was changed to \\"Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad\\". The railroad leased itself to the Atlantic and Great Western Railway in 1863. The C&MV; suffered financial instability, and in 1880 its stock was sold to a company based in London in the United Kingdom. A series of leases and ownership changes left the C&MV; in the hands of the Erie Railroad in 1896. The CM&V;'s corporate identity ended in 1942 after the Erie Railroad completed purchasing the railroad's outstanding stock from the British investors. A number of ownership changes since 1942 have left the track in various corporate hands. Portions of the track are now biking and hiking trails. Founding Jacob Perkins, a prominent attorney in the city of Warren in Trumbull County, Ohio, was the leader in the movement to build a railroad between Cleveland (a fast-growing industrial center and port on the shores of Lake Erie) and the coal fields of east-central Ohio. A previous road to that area, the Ohio and Erie Railroad, was proposed earlier but nothing came of this project. Perkins helped incorporate the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad, which was chartered by the state of Ohio on February 22, 1848. It was authorized to build a rail line from Cleveland to an unspecified point near Warren. Initially, Perkins attempted to interest the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad (O&P;) into building the line, but that company declined. He then offered the charter to the Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad, but it was uninterested as well. The state reissued the charter, with minor amendments, on March 20, 1851. One of these changes allowed the road to build its line into Pennsylvania, if that state permitted it. The Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad was organized on September 20, 1851. The incorporators included Perkins; Dudley Baldwin, Cleveland investment banker; Robert Cunningham, businessman in New Castle, Pennsylvania; Frederick Kinsman, a Trumbull County judge and land agent; James Magee, a wealthy Philadelphia tack manufacturer and one of the founders of the Pennsylvania Railroad; Charles Smith, a Warren businessman and banker; and David Tod, Mahoning County attorney and former U.S. ambassador to Brazil. The initial board of directors included Perkins, Baldwin, Kinsman, Smith, Tod, and Reuben Hitchcock, a judge from Painesville in Lake County, Ohio. Cleveland was chosen as the corporate headquarters. Route and route changes =Deciding on a route= The company surveyed a number of different routes. The route proposed in 1851 had the railroad's northern terminus in Cleveland, where it would connect with the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad. The route then ran through Chagrin Falls, Garrettsville, Warren, Niles, Girard, Youngstown, Poland, and Petersburgh before terminating at Enon Valley, Pennsylvania. Company officials decided in 1852 to bypass Youngstown entirely, shifting the route south (along what is now Interstate 76 and Interstate 80) to reach Enon Valley. David Tod, who returned to the United States from Brazil in 1852, was angry that the railroad would bypass the largest city in his county. He convinced company officials to change the route back. The railroad then proposed that, after leaving Youngstown, the route should follow the Mahoning River to New Castle. There, it would connect with the North Western Railroad and the Ohio & Pennsylvania Railroad. The former gave it access to the Pennsylvania Railroad, while the latter provided access to the industrial and agricultural region between New Castle and New Brighton. At the end of December 1852, a new board of directors was elected. Retained were Baldwin, Kinsman, Perkins, Smith, and Tod; newly elected were Charles L. Rhodes, former agent for the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad, and Henry Wick, a prominent Cleveland banker. Perkins was elected president. =Gauge and fundraising= As the company prepared for construction, it had to decide on a track width (\\"gauge\\"). The track width has been characterized as both narrow-gauge and standard-gauge. It was neither; the gauge was a highly unusual . At the time, nearly all railroads in Ohio were built with a gauge (the \\"Ohio gauge\\"). The directors of the new railroad chose the slightly narrower gauge because they believed it would allow the road to also haul standard-gauge railcars. The confusion about the C&M;'s gauge likely stems from the fact that the Atlantic and Great Western Railway (a broad-gauge railway) and its owned and leased subsidiaries (which included the C&M;) converted to standard-gauge on June 22, 1880. The Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad initially sold stock to raise construction funds. Investors in Warren and Youngstown bought $275,000 ($ in dollars) in stock, while those in Cleveland purchased $100,000 ($ in dollars). The route was surveyed by the end of 1852, and construction was ready to begin toward Warren from Cleveland. =First phase of grading= Work on the track began in 1853. The company said in January that it had identified locations in Cleveland for the construction of its freight and passenger stations and its docks on the Cuyahoga River. The company also altered its route and bypassed Chagrin Falls after residents there failed to purchase enough of the company's stock. The new route shifted south, passing through Mantua. Company officials also said the railroad would not go south to the village of Poland after passing through Youngstown, again due to a lack of stock subscription. The railroad would instead follow the Mahoning River southeast to New Castle and might even go as far south as New Brighton. Grading and track work in Cleveland in 1853 began at the Old Ship Channel of the Cuyahoga River in the Ohio City neighborhood of Cleveland. The route crossed the Old Ship Channel to land near Mulberry Avenue, headed southeast (paralleling the avenue), then ran along the Irishtown Bend of the Cuyahoga River. It cut overland to the southeast to avoid the Scranton Flats and Collision Bend and crossed to the east bank of the Cuyahoga just north of Kingsbury Run. The tracks then ran parallel to and east of Broadway Avenue, shifting to an east-southeast direction about E. 55th Street. After crossing the tracks of the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad, the C&M; turned sharply southward. Before reaching Hamilton Avenue (now called Harvard Avenue), the tracks shifted southeast again, largely paralleling Harvard Avenue, Caine Avenue, and Miles Avenue before leaving the city. This work was completed by a company based in Livingston, New York. The C&M;'s \\"Western Division\\" ran from Cleveland to Warren. This section was graded by a company from Buffalo, New York. The railroad's \\"Eastern Division\\" ran from Warren to its terminus. Grading here was completed by Britton & Co., a construction firm based in Warren. Work between Warren and Youngstown began about August 1853. The road proved more costly to build than anticipated. To obtain more funds, the company sold $850,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds on August 22, 1853. Another $300,000 ($ in dollars) in stock was sold in Philadelphia in early 1854. By July, grading was complete in Cleveland from the Cuyahoga River to the top of the heights in what was then Newburgh Township. Once more, the railroad ran out of money. This time, it estimated it needed another $200,000 ($ in dollars) to complete grading the road to Youngstown. =Second phase of grading= To raise the necessary funds, the railroad decided to sell more bonds. The bond sales faltered badly due to the economic challenges brought about by the 1853–54 recession. Perkins traveled to the United Kingdom in the spring of 1854 to try to sell bonds to investors there, but met with no success. Perkins returned to the United States, where board members pleaded with him to take over the railroad's presidency in an effort to improve its reputation among investors. Perkins agreed to do so, and even pledged to put $100,000 ($ in dollars) of his own money into the railroad—but only if his fellow board members agreed to personally guarantee the road's debts. The board members agreed to do so, with their investment totaling $440,000 ($ in dollars). The strategy worked, for the company was able to sell another $469,200 ($ in dollars) in bonds on September 8, 1854. With construction tentatively scheduled for completion between Cleveland and Warren in 1855, Perkins and Tod spent two weeks in December 1954 in Philadelphia, where they managed to personally borrow $20,000 ($ in dollars) which enabled the company to purchase two locomotives. The road now had sufficient funds to buy rails to lay track from Cleveland to Youngstown and a limited quantity of rolling stock to begin operations. Rails were purchased from the Phoenixville Manufacturing Co., and the first shipment arrived in late May 1855. The railroad's first locomotive, the Philadelphia, was manufactured by the Cuyahoga Steam Furnace Co. and delivered in late July. The second big shipment of rails arrived in mid-October. =Opening of the line between Cleveland and Warren= At Plank Road Station, on Cleveland's southern border, the railroad constructed its first rail yard. The hamlet which grew up around the yards was renamed Randall, in honor of former United States Postmaster General Alexander Randall. (It was incorporated as the village of North Randall in 1908.) Most of the route in Portage County, Ohio, was graded in 1855, and track partially laid. By November 7, the line was complete between Mantua and Warren, and construction trains were running on the line. On November 20, the C&M; awarded a contract to the Chamberlain Co. to grade the route from Youngstown to New Castle. The winter which began in late 1855 was extremely severe, and little construction could be accomplished. This pushed the date for completion of the line into 1856. To accept freight directly from cargo ships, the railroad announced in March 1856 it would build docks on either side of Columbus Street on the south bank of the Cuyahoga River (the southernmost part of Irishtown Bend). The first of track south of Cleveland opened in April 1856. On July 1, the railroad opened all the way to Warren. With the beginning of rail operations, the C&M; needed a superintendent to manage the road's day-to-day operations. W.C. Clelland, of the Pittsburg & Cleveland Railroad, was appointed superintendent on June 15, 1856, but he resigned suddenly just a month later. Charles L. Rhodes was then appointed superintendent temporarily. He was replaced by George Robinson, a superintendent with the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad. Robinson, who also was the C&M;'s chief engineer, stayed until 1865. =Completion of the line to Youngstown= The C&M; reached Youngstown in the fall of 1856, and opened for commercial traffic to that city on November 24, 1856. This left the C&M; short of any connection to an eastern railroad. Track did not initially extend beyond Youngstown in 1856. In part, the railroad lacked the funds, saying it needed at least $50,000 ($ in dollars) to complete this work. The C&M; also discovered that the North Western Railroad at Blairsville was willing to ship freight east but not west, which significantly hindered the new road (as it was costly to ship empty rail cars back to Cleveland). No additional work on the Cleveland and Mahoning's main line was made after 1857, leaving the main line just about long. Independent railroad: 1857 to 1863 Map of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad =Early operations= The Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad also failed to complete its northern terminus. Work on the main line had terminated at the docks on the Scranton Flats (not Irishtown Bend), leaving the railroad short of its connection with the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad. Firming up operations on the existing, incomplete road became the company's immediate goal. It initiated a new bond sale on March 27, 1857, raising $344,100 ($ in dollars). A portion of these funds were used to lessen the steep grade in the Tremont area of Cleveland. The company also purchased 11 more locomotives. To accommodate its growing fleet, the C&M; contracted with the Chas. Weatherhead construction firm to build its first maintenance shops and roundhouse In Cleveland, just west of the intersection of Literary Road and Mahoning Avenue. In 1861, the railroad demolished its existing wooden bridge over the Cuyahoga River near Kingsbury Run in Cleveland, and replaced it with an iron Howe truss bridge. The C&M; still needed to find a connection to an eastern railroad. In April 1853, the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted legislation allowing the C&M; to run cars to New Castle, but the statute did not authorize construction of a railroad. This changed in February 1854, when the Pennsylvania legislature amended the law to allow the C&M; to build a line \\"to a point at or near New Castle\\". These rights, however, only lasted for ten years. The North Western Railroad offered to build a line to the C&M; from New Castle, but C&M; officials expressed disinterest in this approach because they were already in talks with a different railroad. The Panic of 1857 and opposition from Pittsburgh business and railroad interests (whose city would be bypassed by the connection) ended any further overtures by the North Western Railroad. =Building the Hubbard Branch= As the iron and steel industry in the Mahoning Valley grew significantly after 1856, far less coal was available to send to Cleveland. This loss of freight traffic negatively impacted the C&M;'s profit margin to a great degree. To solve the problem, the road decided to build a branch from Youngstown into the coal fields around Hubbard, Ohio. To raise funds to build the branch, the railroad sold $72,500 ($ in dollars) worth of new bonds on January 15, 1862. The Hubbard Branch was under construction by February 1863. Initially, railroad officials predicted it would be complete by May 1863, but the dire need for railroad ties and rails brought about by the American Civil War delayed this, and the Hubbard Branch was not finished until 1865. The branch extended from the terminus of the C&M;'s main line in Youngstown to the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. Completion of the C&M; to Youngstown led to the significant diminution of traffic on the nearby Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal. Opened in 1840, the canal connected New Castle with Akron, Ohio, by following the Mahoning River and then West Branch of the Mahoning River before cutting cross-country to the city of Kent, Ohio. From there, it largely followed the Cuyahoga River to Akron. With the C&M; in financial difficulty due to the loss of coal traffic, the state of Ohio decided in 1863 to sell its stock in the canal to the railroad for $30,000 ($ in dollars). The sale was intended to give the railroad a new source of revenue, but the C&M; barely used the canal. The canal's value was in its right of way, and the C&M; later sold most of the canal to the Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Toledo Railroad, which filled it in and used it as the bed for its track. Operation by the Atlantic and Great Western Railway =C&M; involvement in the creation of the A&GW;= As early as 1852, the C&M; was in talks to make its eastern connection with the Atlantic & Great Western Railway (A&GW;). The impetus behind the talks came from the completion in early 1851 of the Erie Railway (then known as the New York and Erie Rail Road) between New York City and Dunkirk, New York (a small town on the shore of Lake Erie halfway between Buffalo, New York, and the New York-Pennsylvania border). On June 30, 1851, the state of New York issued a charter to the Erie and New York City Railroad, giving it authority to build a railroad line from Salamanca, New York, westward through Randolph and Jamestown to the Pennsylvania border. Work began in 1853, but the railroad ran out of money in 1855 and became moribund. Business interests in Ohio greatly desired a cross-state railroad which would link with the Erie at some point. In March 1851, the state of Ohio chartered the Franklin and Warren Railroad (F&W;), authorizing it to build a railroad from Dayton, Ohio, to Warren and then east to the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. The F&W; investigated the charter of the Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad, which had been chartered in 1846, and discovered that its vaguely-worded charter allowed it to build a railroad from Kinsman, Ohio, to any point in Warren County, New York. Frederick Kinsman, president of the F&W;, invited C&M; president Jacob Perkins to meet with representatives of the Pittsburg & Erie, the Clinton Line Railroad, the Erie & New York City, the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad, and a group of financiers from Meadville, Pennsylvania, on October 1, 1852. The C&M; and most of the other railroads present agreed to join forces, and to seek a connection with the Erie Railway. The Erie agreed not only to a connection but also to survey the proposed route across Pennsylvania at its own expense. The Franklin & Warren changed its name in 1853 to the Atlantic & Great Western Railroad (A&GW; OH). The A&GW; OH began work in August 1853 with funds provided by the Meadville investors, but money ran out after only a few miles were graded. While the Ohio railroad stalled, in April 1857 the state of Pennsylvania granted a charter to the Meadville Railroad Co. to build a line from Erie, Pennsylvania, to Meadville. The state also gave the Meadville the right to purchase any a branch line constructed under the charter of the Pittsburg & Erie. These rights were purchased in July 1857, but the Panic of 1857 left the Meadville unable to sell any construction bonds. The Meadville changed its name to the Atlantic & Great Western Railroad (A&GW; PA) in 1858. Officials of the A&GW; PA traveled to the United Kingdom to seek investors, where it won the backing of expatriate railroad financier James McHenry. Additional support came in July 1858 when José de Salamanca, 1st Count of los Llanos sold $1 million ($ in dollars) of A&GW; PA construction bonds in Spain. The A&GW; PA incorporated a new company, the Atlantic & Great Western Railroad (A&GW; NY), in New York state in 1859 and purchased the Erie & New York City. In the first public indication that the Cleveland and Mahoning and all three A&GW; roads were working together, the news media reported in March 1859 that the A&GW; (a wide-gauge road) had even proposed to add a third rail to the C&M; tracks all the way to Cleveland so that no transshipment of freight or passengers need occur. In January 1860, the A&GW; roads announced that they had an agreement to use the C&M; to reach Cleveland, even though the latter road still had no connection to any other railroad in the city. The A&GW; NY opened between Salamanca and Jamestown in September 1860, and to Corry, Pennsylvania, in May 1861. The outbreak of the Civil War caused funds for construction to dry up, so in August 1861 officials from all three A&GW; roads sought out McHenry again. McHenry and the monarchy of Spain both provided more funds to the A&GW.; The Trent Affair, which threatened war between the United States and United Kingdom, delayed receipt of these funds slightly. Work resumed in mid-1862, and in February 1863 the English railway magnate Sir Morton Peto made an additional large investment in the three A&GWs; (which established a joint board of directors to govern all three companies under the name \\"Atlantic and Great Western Railroad\\"). =Completing the C&M; in Cleveland= The Atlantic & Great Western and the Cleveland and Mahoning connected at Warren some time before May 28, 1863. In July 1863, the A&GW; leased the C&M.; Part of the lease required the A&GW; to complete the last of C&M; track in Cleveland by May 1, 1864. This meant extending the track to the proposed terminus on Whiskey Island on the Old Ship Channel, as well as completing all necessary side track, turnouts, and docks. In an addendum, the A&GW; also agreed to lease the incomplete Hubbard Branch and complete it by January 1, 1864. McHenry advanced the C&M; $300,000 ($ in dollars) to enable it to purchase rolling stock. A&GW; trains began running on the Cleveland & Mahoning on July 20, 1863. Work on a new passenger depot at the Scranton Flats began in August 1863, and a rail yard for the new depot completed on November 4. =C&M; operations under the A&GW;= The Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad leased two smaller Ohio railroads on January 1, 1864. The larger road to be leased was the Niles and New Lisbon Railroad, which the C&M; obtained access to for 90 years. This railroad traced its origins to an 1827 charter permitting construction of a line linking Ashtabula (on the shore of Lake Erie) with the village of New Lisbon in Columbiana County, Ohio. The Ashtabula and New Lisbon Railroad Company began construction on the line in 1853. It was only completed between Ashtabula and Niles (a town about halfway between Warren and Youngstown), and in 1864 the uncompleted section was leased to the New Lisbon Railroad Co. This road went bankrupt trying to complete the line. The Niles and New Lisbon Railroad purchased the incomplete Niles-to-New Lisbon segment in 1869 and finished construction. The smaller road to be leased was the Liberty and Vienna Railroad. This road extended from the Church Hill Coal Co. Railroad in Liberty Township (about north of Youngstown) due north to the unincorporated village of Vienna. The route was completed in 1868, and extended west to Girard and then southeast to Youngstown in 1870 (a distance of ). Although the Girard-and-Youngstown branch was sold in 1871 to the Ashtabula, Youngstown and Pittsburg Rail Road, the remainder became part of the C&M.; The Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad's focus on connecting with the A&GW; led the C&M; to neglect its responsibilities under its Pennsylvania charter. On May 4, 1864, the Pennsylvania General Assembly repealed the C&M;'s charter, and turned over authority to construct a route between the state line and New Castle to the Lawrence Railroad and Transportation Co. The C&M; still sought a direct connection to Pittsburgh, and began seeking an extension of its charter authority in 1866. The Pennsylvania General Assembly refused to approve the charter revision in April 1866, after heavy lobbying against it by Pennsylvania railroads. Committed to reaching New Castle, however, the C&M; reluctantly agreed to connect to the Lawrence Railroad once it completed its branch line between New Castle and the Hubbard Branch. (Work on the branch line was completed in March 1867.) On June 20, 1864, the A&GW;, pushing from the west, created another link with the Cleveland and Mahoning. With the western end of the A&GW; connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad, which gave C&M; freight access to St. Louis, Missouri. =A&GW; first bankruptcy and Hubbard Branch extension= On August 19, 1865, the three A&GW; railroads merged into a new company, the Atlantic and Great Western Railway. The A&GW; went bankrupt in 1867. The A&GW; was now leased to the Erie Railway. Beginning in 1867, railroad developer and speculator Jay Gould had waged a successful stock battle for control of the Erie Railway. Gould now began to extend the Erie's reach westward to Chicago, a critical market if his road was to compete with the New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad. His first step in this endeavor was to lease the Erie's long-time partner, the A&GW.; In 1869, the C&M;'s Hubbard Branch finally gained access to Pennsylvania via trackage rights on two small railroads. The first of these was the Sharon Railway, which was constructed by the Sharon Iron Co. in 1862 to link its iron works with the Brier Hill coal mine in Brookfield Township, Ohio. This long industrial railroad extended from the Pennsylvania-Ohio border to Sharon, Pennsylvania, and then slightly north to Pymatuning Junction. The other leased railroad was the Westerman Railroad, completed on May 20, 1864, and constructed by Coleman, Westerman & Co. to connect its iron works with the coal mines in Brookfield Township. This long industrial railroad originated in Sharon and extended into Ohio. Together, the Sharon Railway and Westerman Railroad pushed the Hubbard Branch a total of into Pennsylvania. The C&M; obtained trackage rights on both industrial roads, upgraded the line for passenger and freight trains, and ran its first passenger train over them on April 1, 1869. The A&GW; emerged from bankruptcy in 1871 under its old name, the Atlantic & Great Western Railroad, and the lease to the Erie ended. Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad =1872 creation of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad= James McHenry purchased all but 19 shares of the C&M;'s outstanding stock in April 1872. This stock was then transferred to an investment trust, the Rental Trust Bonds of the Atlantic and Great Western Railway (\\"the 1872 rental trust\\"). Recognizing the importance of the Niles & New Lisbon and the Vienna & Liberty shortlines to the C&M;, McHenry now moved to ensure that neither line could be taken from him. He sold about $5.5 million ($ in dollars) in bonds to purchase the two roads, and then created a sinking fund for their revenues to repay the debt. On July 25, 1872, the Cleveland & Mahoning, Niles & New Lisbon, and Vienna & Liberty were merged under the laws of Ohio into a new company, the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad (C&MV;). Over the next several decades, the C&MV; made money but the two shortlines did not. The C&MV; now began being referred to as the Mahoning Division of the Atlantic & Great Western Railroad. =Second A&GW; bankruptcy= Gould lost control of the Erie Railway in March 1872, but the railroad's new managers retained Gould's strategy of trying to reach Chicago. In a lease dated May 1, 1872, but not ratified by stockholders until June 25, the Erie Railway agreed to lease the A&GW; for 99 years for an annual rent of $800,000 ($ in dollars) a year. The lease did not cover the C&MV;, however, which remained tied only to the AG&W; and not the Erie. After Hugh J. Jewett became president of the Erie in July 1874, he discovered that the lease required the A&GW; to purchase a controlling interest in the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway, and turn over the stock to the Erie. This the A&GW; had not done. Moreover, the A&GW; had the right to demand that the Erie deposit an unlimited amount of securities in an Ohio bank of its choosing in order to ensure the good creditworthiness and continuing operation of the A&GW.; Jewett declared the lease broken by the A&GW;'s failure to perform. Its finances destabilized by the loss of rental income and security guarantees, the A&GW; went into receivership on December 8, 1874, The AG&W; spent six years drifting through bankruptcy. As it did, the C&MV; expanded its route slightly when the Sharon Railway extended its line to Shenango Junction in 1876. In 1877, Chagrin Falls businessman William Hutchings constructed a branch from Chagrin Falls to the C&MV; main line. =Nypano lease of the C&MV;= The A&GW; finally emerged from bankruptcy in 1880. The company owed more than $60 million ($ in dollars), and most of its rolling stock had been repossessed for lack of payment. It was widely believed in the railroad industry that the A&GW; could be made profitable with the expenditure of about $5 million ($ in dollars), which would allow it to be converted to standard- gauge and purchase enough rolling stock to make it operational again. The Erie Railway (now formally known as the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad), still seeking a western main line, agreed to raise the money. The A&GW; would be permitted to retain two-thirds of its earnings, with the remaining one- third going to the Erie. In England, McHenry and the other owners of the \\"1872 investment trust\\" were outraged: They had purchased more than $50 million ($ in dollars) in AG&W; stock and $70 million ($ in dollars) in AG&W; bonds, and had seen no return. They initiated several lawsuits which delayed the A&GW;'s emergence from bankruptcy for three years. Finally, on March 16, 1880, the five trustees of the A&GW; organized a new company, the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad (NYP&O;, pronounced \\"Nip-ah-no\\"), on behalf of the bondholders. The Atlantic & Great Western was sold to the NYP&O; on March 20, 1880. On June 22, 1880, the C&MV; was converted to standard-gauge in a single day. In order to retain control of the C&MV;, the NYP&O; executed supplemental leases with the road on May 4, 1880, and again on April 24, 1883. The NYP&O; converted the C&MV;'s trackage rights on the Westerman Railroad into a formal lease on January 1, 1886. In the spring of 1886, the NYP&O; completed the C&MV; route in Cleveland, at last making the connection to another railroad. To cross the peninsula between the Old Ship Channel and the Irishtown Bend, the track bed was placed in a channel, with Hemlock, Maine, Washington, and Winslow Avenues passing over the tracks via stone bridges. Trains began running July 4. The C&MV;'s rail yards extended for nearly along the southwest bank of the Old Ship Channel, around Irishtown Bend, and in Tremont. The NYP&O; replaced the C&MV;'s bridge over the Cuyahoga River at Kingsbury Run with a jackknife bridge, and rebuilt the bridge over Kingsbury Run itself. The NYP&O; also built a new C&MV; dock just north of where the C&MV; tracks curved westward to pass under Detroit Avenue. =Fourth Erie lease= On March 6, 1883, the Erie Railroad leased the NYP&O.; By 1886, the C&MV; was the NYP&O;'s most important line, generating 55 percent of the entire NYP&O;'s of annual freight. There was so much freight traffic on the C&MV; that the line was overloaded. Its docks in Cleveland were still not automated, and the use of manual labor left so much freight backed up that the docks actually moved less freight in 1886 than they did in 1885. A joint study of the situation by the Erie and C&MV;, released in February 1888, recommended that the line between Cleveland and Youngstown finally be double-tracked at a cost of $1.25 million ($ in dollars). The study also recommended, among other things, that new steam-powered unloaders be built at the Cleveland docks at a cost of $250,000 ($ in dollars). Double-track work began in May 1888 with the successful sale of new bonds. Work commenced in the early fall of 1888. To cut costs, the C&MV; prefabricated each short bridge and carried it to the worksite en toto on flatbed cars. There, the bridges were placed on skids before being winched into place using hand-powered derricks. Larger bridges were prefabricated in pieces, and set into place the same way. In only one case, that of the longest bridge on the line, did the railroad need to build a temporary trestle to carry the track while a new bridge was put in place. The C&MV; found, however, that it had too few funds on hand to complete the double-tracking and build all the required rail yards. Officials decided to regrade the entire road for double track, but only lay of rail. The double-tracking effort ended in 1890, with just of track left to double. =Erie ownership of the Nypano= The NYP&O; once more fell into financial difficulty in 1895. The Erie Railroad agreed to purchase all the debt and stock of the road on January 1, 1896. The NYP&O; was reorganized on March 16, 1896, as the Nypano Railroad Company. The Erie continued to lease the C&MV; as well. This latest lease gave the Erie control of the road until March 1, 1962, in exchange for an annual rent of $514,180 ($ in dollars). A number of changes were made to the C&MV; over the next 35 years. The railroad was realigned between Hubbard and Chestnut Ridge (County Highway 12 to the northeast), and several tight curves improved. The Sharon Railway purchased the New Castle and Shenango Valley Railroad in November 1900, finally giving the C&MV; a connection to New Castle. On January 1, 1901 (retroactive to December 1, 1900), the Nypano leased the Sharon Railway for 900 years. The new lease allowed the C&MV; to abandon the rarely- profitable Vienna & Liberty Railroad, which it did in 1901. The Nypano spent $3 million ($ in dollars) on C&MV; track, depot, and yard improvements in 1903. Fifteen bridges were replaced in 1905, including a two-span bridge over the Shenango River at Sharon. In 1941, the Nypano leased a portion of the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad line in Ravenna, Ohio. This piece of track became the Mahoning Division's main line (giving the division a better route through the city than its existing double-tracked and single-tracked lines). The Erie purchased this track in 1945. In 1912, the Nypano replaced the damaged swing bridge over the Cuyahoga River north of Kingsbury Run with a new , double-tracked, single-leaf Strauss bascule bridge. The Nypano built a new, steam-operated coal tipple and dock for the C&MV; in 1912, near what is now the western abutment of the Detroit-Superior Bridge. It was designed by Wellman Engineering, a prominent Cleveland firm. C&MV; traffic along the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland was so extensive, the C&MV; expanded its rail yard at Irishtown Bend to eight tracks to accommodate it. Construction on the Detroit-Superior Bridge began in 1914, The coal tipple was moved upstream in 1917 to accommodate the bridge. On March 9, 1917, the Nypano signed a new, amended lease with the C&MV.; This lease gave the Nypano control of the road for 999 years in exchange for an annual rent of $558,967 ($ in dollars) (plus taxes). In the mid-1920s, the Erie Railroad fell under the control of the Nickel Plate Securities Corporation. This company had been established in 1915 by O. P. Van Sweringen and M. J. Van Sweringen (\\"The Vans\\"), two brothers from Cleveland. The Vans were real estate developers who had been frustrated in their attempts to win construction of a streetcar line from their Shaker Heights, Ohio, development to downtown Cleveland. In April 1916, the Vans purchased a controlling interest in the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (known as the \\"Nickel Plate Railroad\\"), whose charter permitted a rail line into downtown Cleveland. To protect their Nickel Plate investment, the Vans began acquiring other railroads as well. As part of this strategy, from November 1924 to January 1925 the Vans purchased enough stock in the Erie Railroad to take control of that property. =Erie Railroad purchase of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley= The complex system of holding companies and loans which the Vans used to build their railroad empire collapsed in 1933 with the onset of the Great Depression. As the Van Sweringen railroads struggled with bankruptcy, the Erie Railroad sought ways to cut costs. The company was still paying $558,967 to the British stockholders of the C&MV;, even though income from the line had fallen far below that. Erie officials learned that the stockholders, many of whom needed cash to help them get through the depression, would be willing to sell. The Erie needed a loan to pay for the transactions. It approached the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which in mid-October 1939 approved the loan. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approved the $7.9 million ($ in dollars) purchase on November 16. This left only the Nypano (the C&MV;'s lease-holder) and the C&MV;'s bondholders as the only obstacle to the Erie's complete ownership of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad. In 1941, the Erie sought approval from the ICC to sell $18 million ($ in dollars) in bonds. This would allow the Erie to purchase the Nypano and pay off the C&MV;'s existing bonds. The ICC approved the bond sale on September 15, 1941, and the purchase of the Nypano and C&MV; bonds on October 28. A bankruptcy court gave its approval on December 19, 1941, when it allowed the Erie to emerge from bankruptcy. The Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad's existence as an independent corporation came to a close on May 7, 1942. Post-Erie status The C&MV; now became known as the Mahoning Division of the Erie Railroad. About south of Transfer, Pennsylvania, the double track became two parallel tracks. The southern set of tracks (the former Hubbard Branch) kept to the valleys and passed through Sharon to reach Youngstown before moving northwest to Warren. These tracks the Erie called the \\"First Subdivision\\". The second set of tracks stuck to the higher ground, and swung more westerly to reach Warren's north side via a more direct route. These tracks the Erie called the \\"Second Subdivision\\". As both subdivisions left Warren's city limits, they became parallel again. The two tracks crossed just west of Leavittsburg (a location known as \\"SN Junction\\"), with all passenger trains taking the First Subdivision (which became double-tracked again). The Erie Railroad closed the former C&MV; freight docks at Columbus Road on Irishtown Bend on May 31, 1946. At some point, either the C&MV; or the Erie had moved the main passenger and freight station away from Scranton Flats to a new depot located west of E. 93rd Street and Harvard Avenue in Cleveland's Union-Miles Park neighborhood. In January 1948, the Erie announced it would construct a new passenger station at E. 131st Street and Miles Avenue. about to the east. By July, these plans had changed: Now the Erie intended to build a passenger-only depot at the intersection of Lee Road and Miles Avenue, a full mile southeast of the existing location. This would no longer be the main depot, either, but merely a station to give suburban passengers easier access. The Erie's main station shifted to Cleveland Union Station, the massive train station erected in 1927 by the Van Sweringens beneath Terminal Tower. =Erie-Lackawanna Railroad and Conrail ownership= On October 17, 1960, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad merged with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad. The Erie-Lackawanna made major repairs to the former C&MV; track near the Detroit-Superior Bridge in late 1960 after it was discovered that the track bed and subsided significantly. A later investigation concluded that saturated soil, caused by either a nearby broken water line or an unknown natural spring, was the culprit. In 1964, the Erie-Lackawanna canceled all intercity passenger train traffic on the old C&MV;, leaving a Cleveland-to-Youngstown commuter train as the only regularly scheduled passenger service on the line. The Erie-Lackawanna filed for bankruptcy on June 26, 1972, after Hurricane Agnes devastated much of its track. The Erie-Lackawanna lingered in bankruptcy until 1976. A number of other northeastern railroads had also gone bankrupt, and in 1975 Congress enacted legislation creating Conrail, a quasi- governmental corporation with authority to take over the bankrupt roads, improve them, abandon unprofitable branches and main lines, and make freight traffic profitable again. Conrail took over the Erie-Lackawanna and the other railroads on April 1, 1976. Conrail renamed the C&MV; track, calling the old First Subdivision the \\"Randall Secondary\\" and the old Second Subdivision the \\"Freedom Secondary\\". =Changes under Conrail= Conrail abandoned the Lisbon Branch immediately after taking over the Erie-Lackawanna. Conrail then ended Cleveland-to-Youngstown commuter service on January 14, 1977. Conrail began trimming its freight service on the old C&MV; in the 1980s. The railroad began moving freight traffic onto its Cleveland Line (the old Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad) in the late 1970s and early 1980s, leaving the Randall and Freedom Secondaries with almost no traffic. It abandoned the C&MV; line east of Mantua in 1981, and the line between Hubbard and Sharon in 1982. It removed of track between Mantua and Leavittsburg in 1982, and in 1982 and 1983 it removed portions of its track within the cities of Warren () and Youngstown (). In 1982, Conrail removed of track in Cleveland, from the terminus on Whiskey Island to its Von Willer Yard (at E. 93rd Street and Harvard Avenue).; About 1993, Conrail abandoned the remainder of the Randall Secondary east of Chamberlain Road. Some of the former C&MV; main line in Cleveland was lost to road construction in the 1980s. Riverbed Street had, for many decades, been a single-lane road which paralleled the most inland track at Irishtown Bend. The road was widened to two lanes in 1985, with the new eastern lane covering this track. In July 1993, Conrail sold the former C&MV; rail yards on Whiskey Island to Whiskey Island Partners, a real estate development corporation, for $1.6 million ($ in dollars). The private company spent $300,000 moving Conrail's track off Whiskey Island. In December 2004, Cuyahoga County purchased the land from the Whiskey Island Partners, as well as the rest of Whiskey Island, for $6.25 million ($ in dollars). The county used most of the peninsula to create Wendy Park. Conrail sold in June 1994, among other assets, a segment of the Freedom Secondary between Kent and Ravenna to the newly formed Akron Barberton Cluster Railway. This portion of track was later sold to the Portage Private Industry Council, and in 2004 to the Portage County Port Authority (which continued to lease it to the Akron Barberton Cluster Railway). In 1996, the Warren and Trumbull Railroad gained access to two sections of former C&MV; track. In May, Conrail sold a segment of the Freedom Secondary between North Warren and Leavittsburg to the newly formed Economic Development Rail II Corporation, a nonprofit organization created by the Mahoning Valley Economic Development Corporation. This portion of track was leased to the Warren and Trumbull Railroad.; Surface Transportation Board, Department of Transportation.

January 24, 1997. =Norfolk Southern ownership= In 1998, most of Conrail was acquired by CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway, which divided the company between them. The Norfolk Southern (NS) ended up with the Randall Secondary. In June 2009, the Cleveland Commercial Railroad (CCR) signed an agreement in which it leased of the Randall Secondary (between the Von Willer Yard and the end of functioning track east of Aurora).; ; The NS and CCR both proposed in June 2017 abandoning the of the line west of Chamberlain Road, and removing the track. About the C&MV; line =Main line and branches= The Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad's main line ran from Cleveland to Youngstown, and was originally long. Siding and other track along the main line totaled in 1867, but after completion of the line and significant expansion of yards it totaled in 1922. Completion of the main line by the Atlantic & Great Western Railway left the main line long. Doubled (or \\"secondary\\") track along the route was initially in 1898, but had reached by 1922. The Hubbard Branch began in Youngstown and ran through Hubbard to the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, a distance of . The Niles & New Lisbon Railroad (later known as the Lisbon Branch) ran from Niles to a point about south of New Lisbon, a total distance of . The Liberty & Vienna Railroad (later known as the Liberty Branch) ran from Liberty Township to the village of Vienna, a distance of about . The Westerman Railroad and Sharon Railway extended the Hubbard Branch to Pymatuning Junction in Pennsylvania. =Description of the line= After completion of the double-track, the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad had a grade of 0.398 going west and 0.49 going east. The grade was a much steeper 1.1 from the shore of Lake Erie to the heights of Cleveland. The steep grade from the heights to the shore meant that trains were limited to just 130 cars past the North Randall yard. About milepost 41, near Garrettsville, the huge Mahoning Siding had spurs to numerous sand and gravel quarries in the area, and provided extensive holding areas for ore cars as they awaited connection to a freight train. The two tracks of the main line crossed one another just west of Leavittsburg (a location known as \\"SN Junction\\"). In the city limits of Warren, the double track became a gauntlet track. By the late 1950s, the Brier Hill Yard at Youngstown was 25 tracks wide and long. The main line was actually triple-tracked here so that sleeper car trains would not be delayed. Southeast of Crab Creek was Himrod Junction, where trains bound for Pittsburgh could veer southeast and connect with another Erie subdivision. Trains headed for Hoboken, New Jersey, stayed on the C&MV.; Between Hubbard and Sharon, the line single-tracked for . Trains also single-tracked over the Shenango River and across the Pymatuning Swamp. Double-tracking began again at Pymatuning Junction. =Headwaters Trail= Beginning about 1993, Portage County began acquiring of abandoned Randall Secondary track between Mantua and Garrettsville. By 1997, it had assembled the entire segment from various landowners, and the parcels were renamed the Headwaters Trail. A $50,000 ($ in dollars) bequest enabled the newly created Portage County Park District to begin grading the right of way and turning it into a biking aned hiking trail. The eastern portion of the trail was completed about October 1997. The western portion, paid for by a $99,000 ($ in dollars) grant from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), opened the following year. The park district was able to obtain a missing long section of abandoned track in 2003 for $46,000, enabling the eastern and western segments of the trail to connect. The park district acquired an additional of abandoned track at the western end of the trail in November 2017. A $60,000 ($ in dollars) grant from the ODNR allowed the park district to resurface the entire length of the trail in 2018. The same month, the park district signed a purchase agreement to obtain of abandoned track at the eastern terminus of the Headwaters Trail. =Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail= Looking north from Washington Avenue at the north leg of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail. In 1987, a series of archaeological digs at Irishtown Bend led to a report that recommended protecting the site. Following up on this recommendation, the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission released a report in April 1992 that proposed a biking and hiking trail along the old C&MV; track bed at Irishtown Bend and the Scranton Flats to link Whiskey Island in the north with the Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail in the south. In January 2009, a group spearheaded by the city of Cleveland issued a report which once more called for turning the abandoned trackbed between Whiskey Island and the Towpath Trail into a biking-hiking trail. The plan also included the construction of a new pedestrian bridge over the Old Ship Channel of the Cuyahoga River to reconnect the tracks with the old C&MV; rail yard (now part of Wendy Park). Negotiations to obtain title to the C&MV; trackbed began in 2008. The Trust for Public Land (TPL), a national nonprofit which coordinates and facilities the creation of parkland, negotiated on behalf of the group with Westbank Development Corp. On December 28, 2009, TPL purchased for $3.2 million ($ in dollars) title and an easement covering of former C&MV; trackbed between the Old Ship Channel and the Cuyahoga River near Kingsbury Run. Cleveland Metroparks oversaw initial design work for the proposed trail, which began in 2009. The agency began bridge design work in 2014. A February 2015 restudy of Irishtown Bend geologic instability, issued by the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority, led to a delay in constructing trail along Irishtown Bend until the hillside was permanently stabilized. The southern leg of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail opened on August 13, 2015. This leg began at the northern terminus of the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail and crossed the base of the Scranton Peninsula before terminating at Columbus Road on the eastern side of Irishtown Bend. The northern leg of the Cleveland Foundation Centennial Lake Link Trail opened on June 9, 2017. This leg ran from the Detroit-Superior Bridge northwest and west to the Old Ship Channel. Cleveland Metroparks said it would seek bids to build the Whiskey Island pedestrian bridge before the end of 2017. The agency said it hoped to begin construction on the bridge in the summer of 2018, and complete work at the end of 2019.

In natural languages, the distribution of bare nouns is subject to various language-specific constraints. Under the DP hypothesis a noun in an argument position must have a determiner or quantifier that introduces the noun, warranting special treatment of the bare nouns that seemingly contradict this. As a result, bare nouns have attracted extensive study in the fields of both semantics and syntax. In English, vocatives and mass nouns are felicitous in any position in which they semantically make sense. Bare plurals are usually restricted to outside predicate positions, though exceptions to this do arise (\\"the reason is uncommon sentences\\"). Theoretical significance of bare nouns =Bare nouns and the semantic analysis of quantification= Bare nouns, especially bare plurals, have significant implications on the theory of quantification in semantics.Delfitto, D. (2006) Bare Plurals, in The Blackwell Companion to Syntax (eds M. Everaert and H. van Riemsdijk), Blackwell Publishing, Malden, MA, USA. doi: 10.1002/9780470996591.ch8 Consider the following examples: (1) Cats are animals. (2) Cats like fish. (3) Cats are everywhere. (4) Cats are common. Example (1) takes a universal reading: the sentence is true for all cats, and so can be paraphrased as All cats are animals (1'). Example (2) is a general statement that holds for most cats; it can be paraphrased as Most cats like fish (2'). Example (3) is a statement that holds of some cats; it can be paraphrased as There are some cats everywhere (3'). Example (4) is a statement that refers to the cat species as a whole; in other words, The cat species is common (4); even though that there is no single individual cat that has the attribute of being common. (1') All cats are animals. (2') Most cats like fish. (3') There are some cats everywhere. (4') The cat species is common.  Null quantifier analysis  Under the naïve hypothesis that there exist phonologically null quantifiers (annotated as [QSubscript varnothing]), then each of the examples in (1) through (4) would be represented as follows: (1) [Q.ALL varnothing] cats are animals. (2) [Q.MOST varnothing] cats like fish. (3) [Q.SOME varnothing] cats are everywhere. (4) [Q.SPECIES varnothing] cats are common. It must immediately be reconciled that there can be any number of meanings to the null component. Additionally, the interpretation of each sentence is unambiguous, despite the choice of multiple well-formed quantifiers: (2a) All cats like fish. (2b) Some cats like fish. The sentence in (3) poses an even greater problem, as the explicit meaning should be: (3a) Some cats are everywhere. This, however, takes an entirely different scope from (3). As in (3a) a necessarily distinct set of cats is everywhere in the domain of discourse, whereas in (3) the set at each place is not necessarily unique. Finally (4) seems to completely resist traditional quantificational analysis, acting on the entire set of objects, not on any individual member. Several theories have been put forth to explain this discrepancy. These involve treating bare plurals as plural indefinites, or as a separate class of objects referred to as kinds.  Kind-denoting analysis: Carlson 1977  One explanation put forth by Gregory N. Carlson is the treatment of bare plurals as names of a semantic type called \\"kinds\\" that is distinct from typical individuals. With individuals being the topic of traditional semantic discourse, kinds represent the \\"sort\\" of individual. \\"A dog\\" is an indefinite instantiation of the kind \\"dogs\\", \\"the man\\" is a definite instantiation of the kind \\"men\\". This suffices to explain all of the above sentences except (3), as each are true in a possible world if and only if the ascribed attribute is a property of the kind inputted into the predicate. For example, (4) is true if and only if the kind \\"cats\\" possess the attribute \\"common\\" in the domain of discourse. The perceived difference in what level of generic quantification applies is then a pragmatic property of the predicate, determined by what is perceived to be necessary for the statement to hold true. In order for the existential readings in sentences like (3) to hold, another semantic object is defined called \\"stages\\". These represent locations in time and space, and are created to reconcile the fact that sentences like (3) only hold true if there exists a specific spatio-temporal place in which the predicate applies. This contrasts with kinds possessing an attribute determined by the predicate. So \\"cats are everywhere\\" holds true if and only if a stage exists of individuals of the kind \\"cat\\" who are everywhere relevant in the domain of discourse. Crucially, it is not the case that \\"cats\\" as a kind possess the property of being \\"everywhere\\". This creates an ontological distinction between the two predicate types, i(ndividual)-level and s(tage)-level. =Syntax= Bare nouns are of great interest in the field of syntax, as their existence must be reconciled with the hypothesis that all noun phrases in argument positions must be embedded in a determiner phrase. An approach to explain the case of bare plurals is to employ the empty category principle.Longobardi, G. Natural Language Semantics (2001) 9: 335. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1014861111123 Consider the Spanish sentences: (5) Quiero tortillas. want.1SG tortillas 'I want tortillas.' (6) Los esclavos construyeron las pirámides. the slaves built.3PL the pyramids 'The slaves built the pyramids.' Under government and binding theory, the verb \\"quiero\\" properly governs \\"tortillas\\". On the other hand, no governor of \\"Los esclavos\\" is found in (6). This makes eliding \\"Los\\" from (6) infelicitous, and the resulting sentence ungrammatical. This analysis excludes bare plurals from the subject and indirect object positions, which is mainly representative of sentences in Spanish and Italian (though further restrictions apply in much the same way indefinite nouns are treated in both languages). To explain English's lack of restrictions on placement of bare plurals, a more general treatment of bare nouns is employed. Consider the Italian sentence: (7) E' venuto John vecchio Has come John old \\"Old John has come\\" In the Italian reading, the proper noun \\"John\\" comes before the adjective \\"vecchio\\". This is noteworthy, as it contrasts with phrases in which a determiner is present, \\"il vecchio cane\\" directly translating to \\"the old dog\\". This is taken as evidence that in Italian and Spanish, an overt movement of the noun phrase \\"John\\" to the determiner head is undergone. In English, this would take place \\"covertly\\", i.e. at the logical form level. This allows the empty category restriction to be fulfilled in the logical form in English. In Italian or Spanish, if an empty category is not governed in the overt syntax then the sentence will remain ungrammatical. A further distinction exists from languages like Chinese or Japanese which allow bare nouns in any position of a sentence, and languages like Modern French which allow bare nouns in no positions. These can be interpreted as having different constraints on what constitutes an argument. Research into this field is still active, however, and no widespread consensus has been reached. Bare nouns in specific languages =English bare nouns= English bare singulars Bare singulars are a form of count noun. Bare singulars cannot appear as arguments to a verb, as opposed to bare plurals and bare mass nouns. Bare singulars in English are comparatively rare in respect to other languages, however they exist in constricted constructions. They may appear in predication, the object position of particular verbs, prepositions, coordination, and reduplications.Bruyn, Bert Le, et al. \\"Bare Nominals.\\" Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Linguistics, 25 May 2017, linguistics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-399#acrefore-9780199384655-e-399-bibliography-00014. The most common of which are bare locations, which occur with nouns that reference certain spaces: ::John is at sea. (geographical locations) ::Mary is at church. (social locations) ::Mary is on television. (media locations) Other constructions are more rare but exist in English: ::John ate with knife and fork. (bare coordination) ::Mary is head of the department. (bare predication) ::John was cheek to cheek with Mary. (bare reduplication) ::Mary plays piano well. (bare incorporation) English bare plurals Bare plurals are count nouns, and can appear in argument position freely. For example: ::The dog barked. (Singular noun in argument position with determiner) ::*Dog barked. (Singular noun without a determiner, ungrammatical) ::Dogs barked. (Bare plural count noun without a determiner) English bare mass nouns Mass nouns are uncountable, i.e. no number can be assigned to them. In English, the difference between mass nouns and count nouns is distinct, contrary to other languages where the mass vs count distinctions may be neutralized.Nemoto, Naoko. \\"On Mass Denotations of Bare Nouns in Japanese and Korean\\" Linguistics, 43.2 (2005): 383-413. Retrieved 12 Dec. 2017, from doi:10.1515/ling.2005.43.2.383 In Gennaro Chierchia's theory, mass nouns are inherently plural. ::Water is good. (mass noun as verb argument) ::This is water. (mass noun as predicate) =French coordinated bare nouns= Bare-nouns in argument positions in French are almost universally infelicitous, though not entirely non-existent. They are available in very specific constructions, such as idiomatic expressions, and coordination:Roodenburg, Jasper. \\"The interpretations of coordinated bare nouns in French.\\" Proceedings of ConSole XI. 2003. Examples of bare nouns in N-et-N construction: ::Dans cette classe, garçons et filles sont intelligents. (Coordinated bare plurals) ::\\"In that class, boys and girls are intelligent.\\" ::J’ai rencontré ami et collègue à l’aéroport. (Coordinated bare singulars) ::\\"I met friend and colleague at the airport.\\" =Bare nouns in East Asian languages= Mass and count distinctions are said to be neutralized in languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The distinction between singular and plural nouns does not exist either: ::haksayng-un chayk-ul ilk-ess-ta [Korean] ::\\"(A) student(s) read (a) book(s).\\" ::gakusei-wa hon-o yomimashita [Japanese] ::\\"(A) student(s) read (a) book(s).\\" ::xue sheng du shu [Chinese] ::\\"(A) student(s) read (a) book(s).\\" Here, it is illustrated that both \\"students\\" and \\"books\\" act as bare neutral nouns that can behave as singular, plural, or a mass noun depending on the context. This allows for each sentence to have up to nine interpretations (any pair of three possibilities). This being said, a mass vs count distinction can exist when a classifier is added.

He founded the Kiddicraft toy company.  Early life  Hilary \\"Harry\\" Fisher Page was born on 20 August 1904 in Sanderstead, England. He was the first child of Samuel Fisher and Lillian Maude Page. As a child he made his own wooden toys and invented games supported by his father who worked in the lumber trade. Page attended the Shrewsbury Public School from 1918 to 1923 where he began to display his entrepreneurial skills. Interested in photography, he set up a business developing photos for the other students. After his formal education he worked in the timber trade, like his father, for several years and in 1929 married Norah Harris, a long-time friend of the family. The couple's twin daughters were born in 1932.  Kiddicraft  Bri- Plax Interlocking Building Cubes Kiddicraft plastic toys Page, along with several partners, decided to go into the toy business in 1932. The partners opened a small toy shop called Kiddicraft on Godstone Road in Purley, Surrey. Originally, Page imported wooden toys from Russia, but later began to introduce his own designs. Page had become increasingly unhappy using wood as a material for children's toys and was an early advocate of plastics as a safe and hygienic alternative.Page, Hilary Fisher. Playtime in the First Five Years. Second edition. London: Allen & Unwin, 1953. In 1936, he began manufacturing Kiddicraft ‘Sensible’ toys using new injection moulding technology and in 1937 these were sold under the Bri-Plax brand forming a new company, British Plastic Toys Ltd.

These were smaller, refined versions of the Interlocking Building Cube. Bricks could be stacked on each other and were held in place by studs on the top. The bricks also featured slits on their side that allowed panel-like doors, windows or cards to be inserted. He patented the basic design, a 2 X 4 studded brick, in 1947. This was later followed by patents for the side slits (1949) and the baseplate (1952), designs featured in exhibits at the Brighton Toy and Model Museum. The Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Brick sets were first marketed in 1947. As a promotion Page and his family built large display models for the 1947 Earl's Court Toy Fair.Page‘s twin daughters play with a set of Kiddicraft K 263 Building Blocks The Victoria and Albert Museum of Childhood in London lists the bricks among the \\"must have toys\\" of the 1940s. Ole Kirk Christiansen and his son Godtfred became aware of the Kiddicraft brick after examining a sample, and possibly drawings, given to them by the British supplier of the first injection moulding machine they had purchased. Realising their potential, Ole modified the Kiddicraft brick and in 1949 marketed his own version, The Automatic Binding Brick, that became the Lego brick in 1953.Christiansen, Godtfred. \\"Improvements Relating to Toy Building Sets\\" UK patent GB 866557. 26 Apr 1961Walsh, Tim, Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Created Them, Andrews McMeel Publishing, 2005 Page was reportedly never aware of this according to his family, and the company Lego Ole Christiansen founded expanded into Western Europe. British Lego Ltd. was set up in late 1959 and the first sets were sold the following year. Lego eventually acquired the rights to the residual rights in the Kiddicraft brick designs in 1981. In an out-of-court settlement Lego paid UK £45,000 to the new owners of Page's company Hestair-Kiddicraft.

It is the sixth installment of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series and is chronologically set after the events of the previous five games. The game was released on December 4, 2017 on Steam and Game Jolt. A mobile version was released on August 13, 2019, entitled as FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator; unlike the PC version, the mobile release, which is developed and published by Clickteam, is pay-to-play. A Nintendo Switch and Xbox One port will release on October 31, 2020, with a Playstation 4 port coming later in the year. A chronological sequel, Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted, was released on May 28, 2019. Gameplay Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator begins as an 8-bit game where the player must control Freddy Fazbear, the titular character of Five Nights at Freddy's, in order to distribute pizzas to several children. This game eventually ends in a scripted glitch. The game then switches to a dark room where the player faces a broken animatronic with an appearance similar to Circus Baby from Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location (referred to as \\"Scrap Baby\\"). A voice from a cassette instructs the player to observe the animatronic and document their responses to various audio stimulations. A checklist must be filled containing the options \\"no\\", \\"yes\\" and \\"unsure\\". If the player feels the animatronic is about to perform a jumpscare, then they are able to subdue it using a taser. However, the animatronic loses value if it is tasered more than three times, lowering the amount of possible profit that could be obtained from it. If the player is successful in this portion of the game, they earn a cash reward. If unsuccessful, no cash reward will be obtained. On the other hand, the player can refuse to salvage the animatronic and discard it. The player must complete this task with a different animatronic after each of the first four in-game dayshifts. An introduction cutscene featuring Hand Unit is shown to the player, then the game takes a turn to business simulation, where the player buys decorations for their fictional restaurant and places them around the restaurant. Buying these items can increase the atmosphere, health/safety and entertainment standards, with the possibility of also giving them extra revenue. However, many of these items can also increase liability risk and lead to lawsuits which can be fought or settled, both at the cost of money. Sponsorship offers can be accepted for money but can cause audio and visual distractions for the player later in the game. Arcade games placed in the restaurant can also be interacted with to play mini-games. The next portion of the game sees the player using a computer to complete various tasks to maintain the restaurant. However, any dysfunctional or hostile animatronics loose in the establishment will try to attack the player. They can be stopped by shining the player's flashlight into the ventilation openings or by using audio to lure animatronics away. The player can use a network of motion detectors to track the animatronics' movements from one location to another. Unlike the previous games in the series, all four animatronics in the game (Scrap Baby, Molten Freddy, Scraptrap, Lefty) share the same behavior as opposed to having different mechanics. Noise from the computer and primary ventilation system obscures the sounds of the animatronics' movements. The player may upgrade the office equipment in order to increase efficiency and reduce the noise level. The player may also temporarily shut off the computer or switch to a secondary ventilation system that runs more quietly, but is not as effective in controlling the ambient temperature. Any sponsorships accepted will cause loud advertisements to be played randomly on the computer, attracting the animatronics and making the player unable to hear them or do anything for several seconds. The day ends when the daily tasks are done and the computer is logged off. The game ends if an animatronic jumpscares the player, or if the temperature in the office reaches 120 degrees and causes the player character to pass out. In order to complete the game, the player must survive six full days and nights. Several different endings are possible, depending on factors such as the degree of improvement made to the pizzeria, the number of lawsuits brought against the pizzeria by customers and whether or not the player salvaged every animatronic, among other conditions. Plot Some time after the events of the third game, the player character is the new franchiser of the re-branded Fazbear Entertainment Inc., with headquarters in Washington County, Utah. After making an initial investment (a small room, tables & chairs and electricity), the player is left with $100 to spend on a new restaurant. After the first night, they are encouraged to prepare for their \\"ultimate test\\", which is a big party on Saturday. After the day is over, the player is instructed to either complete the maintenance checklist on one of four animatronics of different origin (meeting the criteria under paragraph 4 of their contract) or throw the animatronic back in the alley where they were found being the animatronics stated above. On occasion, the animatronics may already be hiding inside the facility, having been hidden in a previously-purchased low-quality object. After Saturday, depending on if the player has salvaged all of the animatronics or not, the animatronic Scrap Baby (who is actually Circus Baby in a new body after being ejected from Ennard, now controlled by Funtime Freddy, who had modified Ennard's body into the animatronic Molten Freddy) tells the player that they are here to receive a gift and will do what they are created to do (to lure and kill children), making her father proud of her. Cassette Man (later confirmed to be Henry from Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes), interrupts her, calling her Elizabeth and telling her that she and the other haunted animatronics are unknowingly trapped in the labyrinth of vents inside of the pizzeria. He tells the player that he had planned a way out for them, but he has a feeling that they would rather not leave. He says he is remaining as well, and that he is nearby. Cassette Man says that the memory of the pizzeria and the other locations will not be remembered and everything that happened there can start to fade away. A cutscene then plays, showing that the pizzeria has been set on fire with the animatronics inside; images are shown of the animatronics attempting to escape as they are engulfed by the fire. As it burns, Cassette Man explains that the player's attraction was made to lure the animatronics into a trap, and that the souls trapped within them would finally receive peace, with the exception of one, William Afton/Springtrap, whom he informs that \\"the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the Devil waiting, old friend.\\" Cassette Man then talks to his daughter (heavily implied to be Charlie from the novels), whose ghost is possessing the Puppet (confirmed to be inside of the animatronic Lefty), saying he knew she would return, that she wouldn't be content to disappear. It's in her nature to protect the innocent. He apologizes that no one was there to lift her up into their arms the way she lifted others into hers. He tells her that \\"I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.\\" He then says it's time for her and those she has helped to rest, and that it ends for all of them. The video feed then cuts out. Another cutscene is then played, which tells the player that they have completed the work week and earned the certificate of \\"Completion\\". A series of alternate endings may also be achieved. If the player has not salvaged all of the animatronics, receives too many lawsuits or becomes bankrupt, they will be fired from their job. The player may also obtain an ending where the player is deemed insane after discovering blueprints and secret information in their office following their purchase of the “Egg Baby” animatronic. In the \\"Insanity\\" ending, Cassette Man reveals that he unwillingly helped William Afton to build the animatronics and his daughter was the first victim of Afton's mass murder. If the player has discovered the secret endings within the \\"Fruity Maze\\", \\"Midnight Motorist\\" and \\"Security Puppet\\" attractions, a picture of a graveyard will appear at the end of the game, which has six gravestones with the names of Gabriel, Fritz, Susie and Jeremy (likely the children who haunted Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy), on four of them, the fifth one being covered up (later revealed to most likely be Cassidy, the child possessing Golden Freddy) and the sixth one far off in the background (later revealed to be Henry's daughter, Charlotte or Charlie - linking to the books). This gives the player a certificate of \\"Lorekeeper\\". Development In June 2017, Cawthon hinted towards the development of a sixth main game in the series, with a teaser on scottgames.com showing a picture that appeared to be Circus Baby from Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location, but later announced his decision to cancel the game and instead develop a separate installment similar to FNaF World such as a \\"pizzeria tycoon\\". Teasers for a new game began appearing on Cawthon's website in late 2017. On December 4, 2017, Cawthon released Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator on Steam as freeware, which fans presumed to be the game he had referred to previously. In February 2018, Cawthon announced on a Steam post that he would think about gaining help from larger publishers in making future games. In an edited version of the same post, he added that he would be developing an \\"ultimate custom night” for Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria Simulator, which, as revealed on his website, has about 57 animatronics from the game and all other games in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series attacking the player. The custom night was due for release on June 29, 2018. However, in an article Scott made on Steam on June 22, he revealed that he had planned to release the game early, on the 22nd, but because he had promised YouTuber Lewis Dawkins (AKA \\"Dawko\\") that he would not release it before he came back from a cruise vacation, he would wait until June 27 to release the game, the day that Dawkins returned from vacation.Scott Cawthon's promise to Lewis Dawkins, June 22nd 2018 via Steam Reception Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator received mostly positive reviews. GameCrate called it the \\"best value in gaming right now\\", with Rock Paper Shotgun calling it \\"spooky as hell\\". The Ball State Daily News also gave a positive review, calling it \\"an interesting evolution of the Five Nights [at Freddy's] formula\\".

Ronda (born May 30, 1943) is a now retired Western American historian. He is also an emeritus professor of history at the University of Tulsa. During his career, which began at Youngstown State University and finished at the University of Tulsa, Ronda became known for his research on the Lewis and Clark expeditions. He has written multiple works on the subject, as well as appearing on C-Span for a special presentation about the writings of Lewis and Clark, which aired in 2001. Ronda's 1984 book Lewis and Clark: Among the Indians has contributed the most to his reputation as an authority on the subject. Ronda's largest contribution to his field of study was his inclusion of the Native American perspective in the Lewis and Clark expeditions. Early life and academic career James P. Ronda was born on May 30, 1943 in Chicago, Illinois. He is married to Jeanne (Jean) Ronda and from an early age set out to become a professor at the university level. In 1980, he said, \\"I think I knew from the time I was quite young that I wanted to teach history at the university level, and my parents gave me a great deal of support for that choice.\\" Ronda received his bachelor's degree from Hope College in Michigan. Following his graduation, he enrolled at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he would go on to earn his masters and doctoral degrees. Ronda was hired as a professor at Youngstown State University in 1968, where he would serve until 1990.Dr. James P. Ronda Accepts Invitation to Address Annual Banquet Gathering. (1981). We Proceeded On, 7(2). Retrieved from http://www.lewisandclark.org/wpo/pdf/vol7no2.pdf While at Youngstown, he taught and researched topics related to American history. Following his time at Youngstown, Ronda took a position as professor of Western American history, eventually serving as the H. G. Barnard Chair, at the University of Tulsa. He would serve at this university until his retirement in 2008. During his career, Ronda would also serve as President of the Western History Association. He was also named to the Advisory Committee of the International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello. His successes as a professor and an author has led him to various on screen opportunities with C-SPAN, BBC, and PBS. Writings Between 1968 and 1981, Ronda had written three books, but it wasn’t until 1984 that his breakthrough work was published. Lewis and Clark: Among the Indians, published by the University of Nebraska, provided a unique perspective on the already well-known adventures of Lewis and Clark. In the introduction to the bicentennial edition of his book, Ronda cites John Logan Allen's Passage Through the Garden: Lewis and Clark and the Image of the American Northwest as his early inspiration for this book. While reading Allen's book, he committed himself to engaging in a study on Lewis and Clark's interactions and relations with the Native American populations they encountered.Ronda, James, P. (2002). Lewis and Clark: Among the Indians, Bicentennial Ed. Lincoln, Ne. University of Nebraska Press. His book would provide a new way to study the events of the Lewis and Clark expedition through the eyes of the Native Americans they encountered. This would prove to be a challenging task, but Ronda was able to put the narrative together after studying various expedition journals, notes, and other materials available. Since the publishing of this 1984 book, Ronda has produced multiple titles related to the West, and Lewis and Clark. In one of his latest works to date, Beyond Lewis and Clark: The Army Explores the West, Ronda approached the story of Lewis and Clark once again, but focused instead on the overall expeditions by the Army. Stories of Lewis and Clark have dominated the topic of western discovery, however Ronda sets out to tell further stories of the army's role in western exploration. Beyond these two books, Ronda has many other books that have given him recognition. A list of some of his major books are listed in chronological order below. List of books * Lewis and Clark Among the Indians (1984) * Astoria and Empire (1990) * Revealing America: Image and Imagination in the Exploration of North America (1996) * From Conquest to Conservation: Thomas Jefferson and the Changing West (1997) * Voyages of Discovery: Essays on the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1998) * Jefferson’s West: A Journey with Lewis and Clark (2000) * Finding the West: Explorations with Lewis and Clark (2001) * Beyond Lewis and Clark: The Army Explores the West (2003) * The West the Railroads Made (2008) Legacy James Ronda's legacy will be tied to the attention he brought to the Native American perspective on the Lewis and Clark expedition, along with the expanded information his multiple books have added to the subject. Beyond his direct contribution through his writing, his contribution in the classroom have impacted many future historians, providing them with knowledge of the topic and the techniques necessary for those who hope to practice in the field of history.

He was one of the three Japanese men who were secretly sent from Hsinking's Japanese Society, that led to the successful repatriation of most of the 1.6 million Japanese who had been trapped in the former Manchukuo at the end of World War II. Early life He was born in Yanagihara Village, now part of Iiyama, Nagano Prefecture, in 1903. He went a local high school there, and graduated from Meiji University, Tokyo, in 1930, with a major in law. He further studied at the University of Puget Sound, George Washington University, and University of Columbia, from which universities he received BA and MA degrees. He left the US in 1937 and visited Europe, returning to Japan in 1938. Working in Manchukuo Like many adventurous young Japanese at that time, Kunio left Japan and sought his career in Manchukuo, that Japan had established in 1931. He worked in the planning and education departments of , Anshan, which is now the main plant of Ansteel Group ().Paul K. Maruyama (Kunio's son), Escape from Manchuria 2nd Edition (Litfire Publishing, LLC, February 29, 2016) & Arranging Repatriation of Over One Million Japanese  When World War II ended in 1945, about 1.6 million Japanese people were left in Manchuria, most of which was nominally under the Chinese Communist control, but acturaly occupied by the Soviet Army. In 1946, Kunio, then 42 years old, and two younger men were chosen by the All-Manchuria Japanese Society (Tatsunosuke Takasaki, President), to deliver secretly a plea to the Japanese Government for repatriation. Three men independently reached Japan, Kunio having left his family in Dalian in association with Dalian Catholic Church (Father Lane) and escaped Manchuria via Huludao Port, which was still under the Chinese Nationalist control. Once in Japan, the reply of Kijuro Shidehara's government, however, was that little can be done because of the confusion in the post-war Japan.Escape from Manchuria: How the Father of an Olympian Left a Legacy Beyond Olympic Proportions Kunio through his friends' introduction met General Douglas MacArthur, who was the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, and his staff. They immediately sensed a possible human calamity if 1.6 million people were left to hunger and marauding in Manchuria, and started the triangular operation of transshipment among Shanghai, Huludao and Fukuoka. This operation is now known in Japan as the Great Japanese Repatriation from Huludao 1946–48. Kunio's effort to push for the repatriation did not end with simply delivering a message to the Supreme Commander. He further negotiated with other people and organizations, including the staff of the Allied Forces and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Shigeru Yoshida who would become Japan's next premier, and Father Byrne who advised on General MacArthur. He also published a few books on the need and results of the repatriation. Teaching in Colleges From 1953, he taught English and Economics at Meiji University, his alma mater. In 1964, he did economic research at both University of Glasgow and University of Edinburgh. After Meiji University's mandatory retirement in 1969, he taught at Teikyo University. Kunio Maruyama died in Tokyo in 1981. Personal life Kunio was married to Mary Takeda, his sweatheart from his University of Puget Sound days. Both were Christians. Between them were born six children: four sons and two daughters. His third son, , was an Olympian of the U.S. Judo Team.

Wills in Bristol, England, which eventually became one of the largest tobacco companies in late 19th-century Britain, and later became the largest constituent part of Imperial Tobacco. The 1966 Guinness Book of Records named the Wills family, descended form him, as containing the largest number of millionaires in the British Isles, of which 14 left estates in excess of one million pounds since 1910, totalling 55 million, of which 27 million was paid in death duties.Guinness Book of Records, London, 1966, p.230 Wills is said to have been a non-smoker, despite the fact that he is regarded as one of the founders of the British tobacco industry. Origins He was born on 2 March 1761 in Salisbury, England, the son of Edmund Wills, a watchmaker, & his mother Rebecca, daughter of Henry Overton of Andover, Hampshire. Career He came as a young man by coach from Salisbury to Bristol where he formed a partnership with Samuel Watkins to open a tobacco shop on 73 Castle Street, Bristol. They named their operation Wills, Watkins & Co. When Watkins retired from the business in 1789, it became Wills & Co, with Wills as sole proprietor. He soon found new partners, and the company merged in 1791 with the firm of Peter Lilly, which had a mill to grind tobacco into snuff. Lilly and Wills named the new company Lilly, Wills & Co, and they consolidated the operations into Lilly's shop at 111–12 Redcliff Street, Bristol. In 1793 the company name was simplified to Lilly and Wills. When Lilly retired in 1803, he was replaced by Samuel Ditchett, and the firm became Wills and Ditchett. Wills' partnership with Lilly proved to be profitable, and the company in 1804 was valued at £15,435 (2017 value: $1.67 million U.S.). In 1819 they again changed the name of their firm, to Wills, Ditchett & Co., Wills by this time having brought into the operation his sons William Day Wills and Henry Overton Wills II, first as apprentices and later as junior partners. He continued to be involved in the firm until his death on 1 December 1826 in Bristol, when his sons took over their father's interest in the business. They subsequently became senior partners of the company in 1830 when their father's partner Samuel Ditchett retired, and they renamed the company W.D. & H.O. Wills, which grew to become one of the largest tobacco importers in Victorian England. Religious and political activity He raised his children in the strict Congregationalist faith, and his descendants actively supported the church in Bristol for more than a century. His sons were particularly generous in their support for non-conformist religious causes. The Wills family were also active in local politics, both by supporting the Liberal Party and by standing themselves for election to city offices as Liberal candidates. Marriage and children On 24 June 1790, when he was the sole proprietor in his tobacco venture, in Bristol he married Anne Day, eldest daughter of William Day of Bristol,Dictionary of National Biography, 1912 supplement, Wills, William Henry, by Charles Welch a linen draper. By Anne he had the following two sons: *William Day Wills (1797–1865), eldest son, who in 1830 with his brother co-founded W.D. & H.O. Wills, a company that by the late 1800s became the largest importer of tobacco, and manufacturer of tobacco products in Britain. His son William Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke became the first chairman of Imperial Tobacco. *Henry Overton Wills II ( 1800–1871), with his brother was a co-founder of W.D.& H.O. Wills. His son Henry Overton Wills III founded the creation of the University of Bristol and became its first Chancellor, and two of his other sons Sir Edward Payson Wills and Sir Frederick Wills became baronets.

Formed in November 1942, the division was soon sent to the front in December during the Battle of Stalingrad, providing air defense to the 1st Guards Army. In the spring of 1943 the 4th was directly subordinated to the headquarters of the Southwestern Front. The division served with the front, which became the 3rd Ukrainian Front, for the entire war. It supported the 5th Shock Army in the advance to the Dniester in May 1944, and was awarded the honorific Lower Dniester for its actions. The division was awarded Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky for its actions in the Balaton Defensive Operation in the spring of 1945. It was disbanded in 1947, remaining in Eastern Europe postwar as part of Soviet occupation forces there.  World War II  37 mm AA gun of the type used by the division during World War II The 4th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK) began forming in early November 1942 in the Moscow Military District under the command of Colonel (promoted to Major General on 7 August 1943) Artyom Makashutin, who was appointed on 11 November. The 4th departed for the Southwestern Front after completing its formation by 26 November, and arrived between 3 and 4 December in the area of Kalach and Buturlinovka. The regiments of the division covered the troops of the 1st Guards Army in their concentration and deployment areas before the beginning of Operation Little Saturn, a Soviet offensive during the Battle of Stalingrad. During the offensive, the regiments moved forward with the army troops, covering the mobile groups of the army's rifle and mechanized corps. They also used their guns in a direct fire role against Axis tanks and infantry, and provided cover for the combat detachments of the 18th Tank Corps and 5th Mechanized Corps, directly subordinated to the front. By 1 January, the division included the 606th, 633rd, 640th, and 658th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments. During January and February 1943, the division advanced into the Donbass alongside the army. Between 12 December 1942 and 25 February 1943, it was credited with downing 114 Axis aircraft, destroying fourteen tanks, ten halftracks, and 21 vehicles, in addition to killing around 800 Axis soldiers. The 658th Regiment was detached to the 3rd Guards Army in February. In March, its units provided air defense for bridgeheads on the western bank of the Seversky Donets near Svyatogorsk, Izyum, and Balakleya, repulsing large German air raids. By April the division was directly subordinated to the front headquarters; it would remain there for most of the rest of the war. It was withdrawn to the Millerovo area from 25 April to the first half of May for reorganization. On 25 June, the 633rd and 640th Regiments became the 253rd and 254th Guards Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments, respectively. The 658th Regiment was converted into the 268th Guards on 10 August. From August, the 4th fought in the advance through the Donbass and Left-bank Ukraine, as well as the Battle of the Dnieper, as part of the Southwestern Front, which became the 3rd Ukrainian Front on 20 October. In 1943 the division was credited with downing 58 Axis aircraft. In February 1944, the 4th fought in the attack towards Nikolayev and Odessa. It provided air defense for ammunition and supply depots, airfields of the 17th Air Army, and bridges of the 3rd Ukrainian Front until March, guarding rear facilities. From 20 May the division covered the 5th Shock Army and later other front troops in the advance to and the crossing of the Dniester. On 25 May, Makashutin was replaced by Colonel Pyotr Shelko, who led the division for the rest of its existence. With the 46th Army, the division fought in the breakthrough of the German-Romanian positions at Chobruchi and covered the army in its advance to the Danube, before being withdrawn into the front reserve. For \\"exemplary completion of command tasks\\", the 4th received the honorific Lower Dniester for its actions. In the front reserve, the division covered the Danube crossing on the Romanian-Bulgarian border. It then fought in the Belgrade Offensive and advanced into Hungary, covering Danube crossings at Baja, Dunaföldvár, and Dunapentele.

The division fought in heavy fighting to cover the crossing at Dunaföldvár and in the Balaton Defensive Operation, the repulse of Operation Spring Awakening, a German counterattack in March. In the latter, German troops broke through the positions of the 1st Guards Fortified Region and the 26th Army. The 4th fought German armor in the Cece area at the line of the Sárvíz Canal, tasked with preventing a German advance to Paks and Dunaföldvár. The Avenger Battalion and the 268th Guards became part of an ad hoc anti-tank region with other artillery units, helping to repulse German attempts to cross the canal. For its actions in the Balaton operation, the division was awarded the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd class. At the end of the war, the division fought in the Vienna Offensive, defending the surviving Danube bridges.

His father, an Irish captain in the British Army, was a convert to Catholicism; his mother was from a St. Louis family of French descent. He was brought up in a devout Catholic household. The youngest of several children, Charles was sent to local schools and was graduated from Saint Louis University.Spanierman, Deborah Gerstler. \\"Charles Bosseron Chambers Portrait, ca. 1920\\", Antiques Roadshow, PBS, July 8, 2017 He later adopted the middle name “Bosseron” to reflect his French heritage. Chambers studied art for six years under Louis Schultz of the Berlin Royal Academy and then with Aleis Hrdliczka at the Royal Academy of Vienna. He also studied for six years with Johannes Schumacher in Dresden, and spent some time in Italy.\\"A biography of Charles Bosseron Chambers\\", Grapefruit Moon Gallery Due to his mother's failing health, the family moved to Palm Beach, Florida where he began his art career. Chambers is considered a society painter, having done portraits of many of the leading socialites of the early 20th century such as Henry Flagler, actor Joseph Jefferson, members of the Vanderbilt family and others. In 1916 Chambers moved to Manhattan with his wife Anne, the niece of Archbishop Patrick Feehan of Chicago and established himself in the Carnegie Studios, Carnegie Hall, where he had a private studio. Chambers was a member of the Society of Illustrators, in New York City, and the Salmagundi Club, an important art club also in the city. In April 1921 his work was exhibited at the Babcock Galleries on 49th St.,\\"Exhibition of Paintings by C. Bosseron Chambers\\", Babcock Galleries, New York. April 11th to 23rd, 1921 in 1923 he illustrated Sir Walter Scott's Quentin Durward for Scribners.Catalogue off Copyright Entries, Third Series: 1951, Copyright Office, Library of Congress, 1952 In November 1935, a number of portraits were on display at the Macbeth Gallery on E. 57th St.Arts Magazine, Vol. 10, 1935, p. 2 His work can now be seen at the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis and at the Osceola Club in St. Augustine, Florida, among other places. Between 1920 and 1950 millions of Chambers religious paintings were reproduced and widely displayed. While he continued to accept commissions for society portraits, it was his work in the religious field, prints, holy cards, calendars and magazine covers that brought him national recognition and a steady source of income. Charles Bosseron Chambers died in New York in 1964. Works Chambers worked in oil painting, water colors, and charcoal drawings. Known as the \\"Norman Rockwell of Catholic art\\", his religious paintings have become highly collectible, his most famous being Jesus portrayed as a young boy in \\"Light of the World.\\"Poston, Bruce. \\"Collecting Charles Bosseron Chambers, aka the Norman Rockwell of Catholic art \\", Reading Eagle, May 18, 2012 =Light of the World= In 1919 Chambers was commissioned to do paintings for the side altars in the newly built St. Ignatius Church in Rogers Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.McNamara, Denis Robert. \\"St. Ignatius\\", Heavenly City: The Architectural Tradition of Catholic Chicago, LiturgyTrainingPublications, 2005, p. 17, There, Chambers produced a painting of St. Joseph holding the infant Christ. A detail of that painting, the face of four year old model Gilbert DeMille, son of the custodian at St. Ignatius School, became the Light of the World. Between 1920 and 1940, millions of copies were sold. The print can be seen over the priest's desk in the 1948 film The Miracle of the Bells. Chambers also painted the fourteen Stations of the Cross in the Church. =The Return= According to a popular account, one day, Chambers stopped by the Church of the Holy Innocents on 37th St. for Mass. Afterwards he observed a young man praying before a life-size crucifix and immediately made a quick sketch. In later speaking to the man, Chambers learned that he was a Frenchman who had drifted away from religion since coming to New York, but was now heading back to fight in World War I, and had prayed for a return to the faith. Chambers produced an oil painting from the sketch.Chessman, Stuart. \\"The Churches of New York XXXIX: Commuters, a Shrine and the Traditional Mass\\", The Society of St. Hugh of Cluny, June 30, 2013\\"The Return\\", Scribner's Magazine - frontispiece, January 1919, Vol. LXV, No. 1 According to the American Art News, \\"His remarkable picture, The Return, which shows a soldier at the foot of a crucifix, and enveloped in a certain divine mystery and depth of sentiment, compelling and convincing, has been reproduced by one of the largest publishing companies in color and sepia, and having decided success.\\"\\"With the Artists\\", American Art News, Vol. 17, No. 26, Art Foundation Press, April 5, 1919, p. 11 After the war, Chambers was later able to make contact with the soldier, who told him that having survived the war, he had entered a monastery.

Located at the border between the city of Paris and the commune of Boulogne-Billancourt in France, it has been listed along with 16 other architectural works by Le Corbusier as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Le Corbusier lived in the building from its completion until his death in 1965. Location The east facade is located at 24, rue Nungesser-et-Coli, which marks the border between the 16th arrondissement of Paris and the commune of Boulogne-Billancourt. The west facade overlooks rue de la Tourelle, located entirely within Boulogne-Billancourt. History In 1931, the real estate developer Société Immobilière de Paris Parc des Princes, represented by Marc Kouznetzoff and Guy Noble, acquired a building site in the east of Paris, adjacent to Boulogne. Le Courbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret were commissioned to design an apartment building for the site, and asked to find potential clients from among their acquaintances. The developers had not yet secured the required financing and were eager to demonstrate that avant-garde architecture could be more attractive to buyers than the conventional buildings in the vicinity. Between July and October 1931, Le Corbusier and Jeanneret designed an eight-story building with fifteen apartments, with two or three units per level. The design applied four of Le Corbusier's five points of modern architecture – free floor plan, structure supported by columns rather than walls, free facade, and roof garden. Le Corbusier negotiated with the developers and acquired the right to occupy the top two floors, to be built at his own expense, for his own apartment. Construction began in 1932. It was interrupted for several months because some of the units had yet to find buyers, while the two developers were facing serious financial difficulties. The building was completed in early 1934, but by 1935 the Société Immobilière de Paris Parc des Princes had gone bankrupt. The bank which had financed the project contested Le Corbusier's title of ownership and wished to sell the entire building. This was the start of a decade of legal proceedings, at the end of which, in 1949, the architect's title was recognized. During these years maintenance of the building was neglected, causing problems with rust in later years. A major renovation was conducted in 1950, and again in 1962. The architect and his wife resided in this building until her death in 1957 and his in 1965. Since his death the atelier and apartment are owned by the Fondation Le Corbusier and may be visited by appointment (closed for renovations from September 2016 to May 2018). One wall in the lobby is covered by a mural of the architect's Poem of the Right Angle, a statement of his late aesthetics. Architecture View toward the living room from the entrance, with stairs to the roof garden on the left =Facades= This building is probably the most traditional of Le Corbusier's mature works. The design was constrained by the narrow () and deep () configuration of the site and by strict zoning codes, which specified the parapet height, conformance to the existing street wall, and even the placement of the balconies and bay windows. Nevertheless, the architect's inventiveness is evident in the all-glass facades. Identical on both elevations, they were inspired by Pierre Chareau and Bernard Bijvoet's Maison de Verre, but Le Corbusier departed from Chareau's glass-brick-only prototype by the addition of transparent openings. Externally the facades offer a contrast between solid glass bricks and transparent windows, but internally the apartments are flooded with light across the entire wall. =Le Corbusier's apartment and atelier= The apartment that Le Corbusier built for his personal use on the top two floors extends over . It is reached by stairs from the sixth floor, the last level served by the elevator. Rooms are arranged so as to eliminate corridors and minimize the number of doors. The seventh floor contains the entrance, living room, kitchen, and atelier. The eighth floor contains a guest room and access to the roof garden. Walls are painted in pure primary colors. The atelier that Le Corbusier used for his painting has a wall of stone and exposed rough brick that contrasts with the modern concrete and glass materials. Furnishings were designed by Le Corbusier's associate Charlotte Perriand.  Classification  This building was listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture for the apartment of Le Corbusier in 1972 and in 1990 for the facades, court, roof, and entrance hall. In 2016 it was listed along with 16 other architectural works by Le Corbusier as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Gimedze stated that before going to Mauritius, Fashina sent him a letter, fabricating that he was trialling for a French club and stopping in Mauritius only to get a visa. As a consequence, Gimedze messaged the Confederation of African Football to notify them about the incident, turning down an offer from CSSC amounting 70000 Swazi lilangenis to legally buy the player which resulted in Fashina being dropped from CSSC's squad. Despite this, however, the Nigerian returned to ply his trade with them in 2010, signing with CSM Jiul Petroșani of the Romanian Fourth Division until the end of the 2010-11 season after a two-week trial with FC Astra Giurgiu. There, he stated his ambition to play in a higher level of the Romanian football league system, netting three goals in his first 7 games.

Contents High Passage was a magazine approved for use with Traveller. Publication history High Passage was a digest-sized magazine created by Jim Cunningham's High Passage Group, and in August 1981 FASA came to an agreement to publish High Passage, after financial issues prevented further independent publication of the magazine. William H. Keith Jr. started providing art for the magazine, while Jordan Weisman and Ross Babcock did layout and editing; the first FASA issue was High Passage #2 (1981). After a falling out between FASA and the High Passage Group, High Passage #5 (1982) was edited by J. Andrew Keith, and just before High Passage #6 went to press the High Passage Group ended the two companies' partnership and told FASA that they could not publish additional High Passage material. FASA replaced High Passage with a new J. Andrew Keith magazine called Far Traveller, which began publication in October 1982. Reception William A. Barton reviewed the first issue of High Passage in The Space Gamer No. 40. Barton commented that \\"Although there is room for improvement in future issues, High Passage, based on its first issue, stands quite high among the many approved-for-Traveller items now on the market.\\" Reviews *Different Worlds #15 (Oct., 1981) *Different Worlds #18 References Defunct magazines published in the United States Hobby magazines published in the United States Magazines established in 1981 Magazines disestablished in 1982 Role-playing game magazines Traveller (role-playing game) ","title":"High Passage"},{"id":"55971710","title":"Turn Out the Lights (album)"},{"id":"55971740","text":"The Skorge Hydroelectric Power Station ( or Skorge kraftstasjon) is a hydroelectric power station in the municipality of Stad in Vestland county, Norway.
