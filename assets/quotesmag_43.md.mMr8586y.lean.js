After earning her credentials at the Vermont Academy and Smith College, Converse moved to Yokohama where she was influential in establishing girl's education. In addition to directing the Soshin Jo-Gakko (Truth Seeking Girl's School) for thirty-five years, she established several kindergartens. Her work to improve education for women in Japan was recognized by the Blue Ribbon Medal of Honor in 1929. Early life Clara Adra Converse was born on 8 May 1857 in Grafton, Windham County, Vermont to Mary (n√©e Stuart/Stewart) and Newton R. Converse. She was one of nine children and grew up on her parents farm in Grafton, where her father had been born. Her paternal grandparents, Robert and Edna (n√©e Hale) Converse had immigrated from Marlborough, New Hampshire to Vermont before the birth of their children. Her maternal grandfather Joseph Stuart was a miller and farmer from Andover, Vermont. After completing her elementary education, Converse graduated from the Vermont State Normal School at the age of sixteen. Career Converse began working as a teacher in the public schools and in 1877, when the Vermont Academy opened, she enrolled in the preparatory courses, graduating in 1879, as one of the two women enrolled in her class. Continuing her studies Converse attended Smith College, graduating in the class of 1883. Her mother died the following year. Converse returned to Vermont Academy, after completion of her education and between 1884 and 1889, she taught German, Greek, mathematics and rhetoric. One of her students was Florence Sabin. In 1885, she became the superintendent of schools in Grafton simultaneously with her teaching. When her father died in 1888, Converse felt led to become a missionary. Around this same time, the Woman's Baptist Foreign Missionary Society had published a plea for volunteers to go abroad. Converse applied to the society in Boston in May, 1889 and was appointed to teach in Yokohama, Japan at the Mary L. Colby Home. She gave her notice to the Vermont Academy and made her way to San Francisco. Arriving in Japan in January, 1890, she began working and by that autumn, was placed in charge of the school. She was the second principal in the school's history, following the founder Charlotte Brown, wife of Nathan Brown. In 1891, a new school building was erected in Yamate and the following year, the name was changed to Soshin Jo- Gakko (ja), (Truth-Seeking Girls School), to reflect that the girls' education was to be based on a search for Christian ideals. In 1897, Converse received her first furlough and returned to the United States, where she undertook several talks about her work abroad. She returned to Japan and worked to spread the cause of girls' education founding Bible study, Sunday schools and a kindergarten. In 1899, when the Meiji government implemented reforms to the educational system in Japan, Converse secured licensing for the school from the government for the school's operation. She took a second vacation in 1907 and remained in the United States for a year, once again traveling and making presentations to increase support for her work abroad. During that time, a new site and expansion for the school was planned. When she returned, Converse set out to revise the school curriculum, taking the elementary school to six-year program and the girls' high school to a five-year plan with the last three dedicated to their field of expertise. The school continued to change and expand. In 1918, when Tokyo University allowed women to enter, Converse was appointed as a director of studies for women. She terminated the English courses at Soshin since girls could study them in the university, but within the year, she brought them back. Beginning in 1921, she asked for a replacement as principal and began preparing for her retirement, though it would take four years for a new principal, Annabel Pawley to be hired, and for Converse to tender her resignation. Though she retired from the school, Converse continued her missionary works and remained as an emeritus principal, helping with the school. Between 1925 and 1935, she established four kindergartens and assisted with their development. In 1929, Emperor Showa Hirohito conferred on Converse the Blue Ribbon Medal of Honor, in recognition of her contributions to women's education and the Japanese nation. Death and legacy Converse died on January 24, 1935 in Yokohama and was buried in the Mitsuzawa Cemetery. In 1959, the son of Converse's first Japanese graduate came to the United States to pay tribute to the teacher's memory. He had become an educator largely because of Converse's influence on his mother. The school she worked to build was still thriving at that time.

Picking up the story in the period after media coverage of it waned, Amponsah's film sheds light on the environment from which Mark Duggan came. Focusing on two of his childhood friends, Marcus Knox-Hooke and Kurtis Henville, against the backdrop of their home on Broadwater Farm ‚Äî an estate that notoriously was the scene of a 1985 riot triggered by tensions between the police and local black people ‚Äî the film follows the journey of the two young black men over 24 months, until the 2012 verdict that found Duggan to have been \\"lawfully killed\\".Portocarrero, Marta, \\"The Hard Stop: Mark Duggan's best friend says 'one day police will tell the world what actually happened'\\", The Independent, 14 July 2016. Marcus Knox-Hooke was accused of being the instigator of the 2011 riots and, though that charge was dropped, he was sentenced to 32 months' imprisonment following a prosecution for other offences. Producer Dionne Walker has said: \\"We started with Marcus but then he went to prison. There was a whole inquest‚Ä¶ [then] you see in the film where it was a clear decision to follow Kurtis and his home life, which helped set the context of the film. It‚Äôs a microcosm, but there were wider issues going on.‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not an investigative Panorama-esque TV format documentary. It‚Äôs an independent, observational, cinematic film.\\" In the words of Amponsah, \\"Our objective is to tell a story and engage an audience.

She competed in fell running and was convicted of the attempted murder of Ralph Knibbs, HR manager for UK Athletics after Knibbs investigated Jeska's eligibility to compete as a woman.  Early life  Jeska was born Michael Graham JamesonFreeBMD Entry Info to parents Pauline and Graham Jameson. Graham Jameson is a mathematician at Lancaster University and both parents are active in Lancaster Baptist Church. She had two younger brothers who were twins, one of whom had mental health issues and later took his own life. Jeska went to Lancaster Royal Grammar School where she was a cross-country runner. She went on to Oxford University, where she studied physics, gaining a first. Jeska began studying for a doctorate at Oxford but dropped out of the course. She later attended Leeds University, gaining a master's in gender studies.Jailed fell runner thought UK Athletics was 'trying to kill her'  Sport  The GuardianFell-runner Lauren Jeska tried to kill British athletics official because she feared the body would revoke her titles over transgender status Transitioning and fell-running In Easter 1998 Jeska came out to her parents as a trans woman, and had a gonadectomy in 2000. She went on to study gender studies at Leeds University. While at Leeds, she took up fell-running, finding immediate success, winning the Blackshaw Head fell race in 2008. She later joined Todmorden Harriers athletics club, and went on to win the 2010 Three Shires Fell Race, the 2011 Liverpool Half Marathon, the 2010, 2011, and 2012 English, and 2012 British Fell Running Championships. After moving to Wales she joined Aberystwyth Athletics Club. Attempted murder In June 2015, UK Athletics told Jeska that she would be required to provide blood tests to prove that her hormone levels were within normal female range, as there was no documentation for Jeska's 2000 castration. Jeska found this requirement distressing as she felt it would reveal her transgender status publicly. She failed to provide the samples required.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-39266777 In March 2016 she attacked Ralph Knibbs, a former professional rugby player and UK Athletics HR manager, with a knife because she feared UK Athletics would strip Jeska of her records and her eligibility to compete against female athletes. Jeska stabbed Knibbs in the head and neck, resulting in a 2cm hole with blood pumping out.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-39266777 Jeska also attacked Tim Begley and Kevan Taylor, employees of UKA who came to Knibbs' aid. In September 2016, she pleaded guilty to attempted murder, plus two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Begley and Taylor, and weapons charges for knife possession. On 15 November 2016, she was scheduled to be detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983, but the hearing was adjourned for a month pending further psychiatric reports. Jeska was found during these investigations to have autism. In March 2017, Jeska was jailed for 18 years for the crimes, which severed nerves in Knibbs' body leaving him with restricted movement, difficulty eating, and limited vision in both eyes. It was revealed during sentencing that Jeska had twice asked for psychiatric help from the NHS prior to the attacks, but had not been referred for any treatment. Jeska is currently serving her sentence at HM Prison Foston Hall.

He was appointed on 31 January 1888, embarked at Lisbon for the Congo on 6 February and arrived at Boma on 1 March. He had a large workload in the Congo, but he offered his resignation on 1 January 1889. Leaving the administration in the hands of the inspector-general, Henri Gondry, he embarked at Banana on 17 April and landed in Europe on 19 May. ..

It was first described in 1887 by McCook under the name Cyrtophora bifurca, and was transferred to its own genus in 1999. It is the only Cyclosa species north of Mexico to have a forked tail, hence the name bifurca, Latin for \\"two-forked\\". The forked abdomen, bearing two humps shaped like the letter M, is a defining feature in both males and females, though it is similar to features present in certain Cyrtophora species. Both sexes are a transparent green color, though only females have an area of red on their underside between the epigynum and the spinnerets. Females are nearly thirty percent larger than males, ranging from five to nine millimeters, while males range from two to three millimeters. Males are very uncommon. In a 1977 study by Levi, only two of the nearly 350 specimens that were positively identified as Cyrtophora bifurca were males. This is a very odd distribution, and it has been posed that females of the species, which have less prominent genitalia relative to other members of the orb-weaver family, may be parthenogenic, or able to reproduce without the help of males. Like other members of Araneidae, these spiders create orb webs, six to eight inches in diameter, but apply a unique form of protective mimicry. Females sit in the middle of a vertical row of web decoration, with egg sacs above and wrapped prey below. Because they all have a similar color and shape, it is difficult to discern between the egg sacs, the wrapped prey, and the spider itself.

The features are listed on a wireframe ribbon menu. The app is similar in functionality and design to the Clock app on iOS. Alarms & Clock was available on mobile devices for over a decade before it was available on PCs with the introduction of Windows 8.1. Tiles for alarms, timers, and the stopwatch can be pinned to the Start menu. The latest version of the app uses the Universal Windows Platform APIs and uses the system's setting for light or dark theming. Alarms & Clock is not integrated with the taskbar clock. Alarms The alarms are listed vertically by time of day and can be activated or deactivated with an ovular on/off switch. It is possible to delete a selection of alarms simultaneously by clicking on the list button and using the control key with or without the shift key to select alarms. Alarms can be created by clicking the plus button and edited by clicking or tapping on them. It is possible to change the time, name, recurrence by day of the week, sound, and snooze time. The current list of sounds in the order listed is Chimes, Xylophone, Chords, Tap, Jingle, Transition, Descending, Bounce, Echo, and Ascending. Alarms are triggered by a special type of toast notification for alarms. Due to hardware limitations, alarms cannot always appear on certain devices that are powered off. In order for an alarm to ring on a PC that is off, InstantGo must be included in the device. Prior to the Windows 10 Creators Update, Alarms & Clock was the only app that could make an alarm notification appear during quiet hours, but third-party alarms running on Windows 10 version 1704 or later also ring during quiet hours by default. World Clock The world clock list detects the user's location and shows the local time on the user's location on a world map. Users can search for additional locations to show on the map. When other times are displayed, the World Clock feature calculates how far ahead or behind the other times are from the user's local time. It is also possible to compare what nonlocal times will be at a specified local time. When the map is minimized horizontally, the times are shown in a vertical list below the map instead of on it. Users who would simply like a window with an easily visible clock can type timedate.cpl in the Run dialog box (). Timer Timers can be created and named by clicking the plus button at the bottom, like alarms; however, there is no way to edit a timer. It is possible to reset or delete a timer. Multiple timers can be set to run simultaneously. The zoom button on a timer replaces the background with the Windows accent colors, hides other timers and the ribbon, and enlarges the time shown. Arrow navigation buttons allow users to switch between timers in this view. Timers provide notifications when they end. They cannot be reset from the notifications. Stopwatch One stopwatch may be run at a time. A flag button allows the user to record lap times and a share button allows users to share times with other UWP apps. Similarly to timers, the stopwatch has a resize button that simplifies the interface by changing the background and hiding the lap values.

Early life and education Roe was born in 1940, at Tumby Bay, South Australia. Her grandparents had been early settlers of the western coast of South Australia. Her mother Edna Heath, a nurse, died before Roe was two years old, and she was raised on the Eyre Peninsula by her father John Roe, a farmer. At the age of 14, she attended Adelaide Girls' High School. Upon matriculating, she enrolled to study history at the University of Adelaide, and in 1963 moved on to the Australian National University in Canberra, where she wrote her Master of Arts thesis on \\"intellectual life of the city of Melbourne between 1876 and 1886\\", under the supervision of Don Baker and Manning Clark. Career In 1967, Roe joined the newly founded Macquarie University as a lecturer in history. She remained at the university for 36 years, becoming a Professor Emerita upon her retirement in 2003. In 1984, she joined the board of the Australian Dictionary of Biography, serving as the board's president from 1996 to 2006. She also wrote 19 entries for the ADB, and was editor of its 2005 supplement. In December 1982, publisher Richard Walsh of Angus & Robertson commissioned Roe to write a biography of Miles Franklin.

It is located 260 kilometres northwest of Mount Isa. Early history Indigenous people have lived in the Barkly region for thousands of years. The first European to enter the area was William Landsborough in 1861. He reported the pastoral potential of the region describing it as the \\"finest pastoral country he had ever seen\\". In 1866, John and James Ranken, two cousins from old pastoral families in New South Wales, herded 4,000 sheep to the area from Queensland's Mackay district, escaping severe drought. They settled in the area now known as Avon Downs. Three watercourses are named after them, the Ranken River, James River and Lorne Creek. Other pastoralists moved to the area throughout the 1860s, but poor wool prices caused the Rankens and others to abandon the area. In 1882 Thomas Guthrie purchased 1920 square km of the Barkly, expanding that later to more than 3600 square km, naming it Avon Downs after his merino stud 'Rich Avon' in Victoria. It took 12 months to transport the first sheep to the station. Within three decades he developed the property to have a carrying capacity of 70,000 merinos. The station was sold in 1921 to the Peel River Company. Recent history Avon Downs is now owned by the Australia Agricultural Company and is managed by Matt and Tina Barrett.

Born in Ghent, Gondry became an honorary engineer of bridges and roads (ing√©nieur honoraire des ponts et chauss√©es) and was the administrative director of the Belgian State Railways when he was called to serve in the Congo. He was appointed inspector-general under Vice Governor-General Herman Ledeganck and Governor- General Camille Janssen, a post which would require him to act as governor- general in the absence of both men. He was, in fact, the first Congolese functionary drawn from the Belgian civil service, and he brought a high level of professionalism to his colonial duties... Gondry was appointed on 1 January 1889, embarked at Lisbon on 6 January and arrived in Boma on 31 January. He was received by Ledeganck, who, having submitted his resignation on the same day Gondry was appointed, was preparing to return to Europe. As a result, from Ledeganck's departure on 17 April the government was in Gondry's hands. He was zealous for the cause and completely taken with King Leopold II's vision for the Congo, as attested by his letters. He died of cerebral congestion just over a month later.

It is now on land that forms part of Berkhamsted Golf Course. The stone obelisk was erected c.1920, close to the temporary training camp of the corps on Berkhamsted Common which operated from 1914 to 1919. It became a Grade II listed building in November 2016. Background The Inns of Court Officers Training Corps (OTC) was a Territorial Army unit based in Chancery Lane in London, near the headquarters of the Law Society of England and Wales and adjacent to Lincoln's Inn. The corps was closely associated with the legal profession, and its cap badge combined the arms of the four Inns of Court. The Inns of Court OTC expanded rapidly in August and September 1914, as thousands volunteered for military service following the outbreak of the First World War, and the corps quickly outgrew its peacetime premises in London. A training camp opened in tents on Berkhamsted Common, in the west of Hertfordshire in September 1914 and remained in operation until June 1919, hosting around 2,000 officer cadets. As part of their training, the men dug around of trenches across Berkhamsted Common, evidence of which remains visible 100 years later. Around 11,000 were commissioned and became officers in other units. Three were awarded the Victoria Cross, all posthumously: Jack Harrison of the East Yorkshire Regiment in 1917, Walter Napleton Stone of the Royal Fusiliers in 1918 and Christopher Bushell of the Royal West Surrey Regiment in 1918.

History  The line used by the Oriental Desert Express was originally built in the 1920s and 1930s as part of the Mediterranean‚ÄìNiger Railway, but is now only used twice a week by trains carrying zinc, lead, and copper from local mines.

Kunz ended up committing five million euros to the project. The first trip was made in 2006, and the train runs twice annually, such as in 2013 and 2017. Outside camera shots of the Oriental Desert Express were featured in the 2015 James Bond film Spectre.  Journey  , the total travel time of the Oriental Desert Express can take between eight or twelve hours.

Traversing the Hautes Plaines, the train makes a stop at the small town of Tendrara, Tagmo·∏çant. While the train generally travels at a speed of about , travel time between Tendrara and Bouarfa can vary greatly due to unplanned stops to clear sand from the railroad track, for which the train carries diagonal shovels, and meeting nomadic tribes. One such meeting was related by Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung: > ... again the train stops. There are sheep outside and tents. We have > arrived at nomads. The family leader invites us to tea in his tent.

Congressional elections are held every even year (2012, 2014, 2016), and gubernatorial ones every off-presidential even year (2010, 2014, 2018). The results of the elections are often varied. Maine is seen as a swing state, unusually high support for independent candidates. The Republican Party have won Maine in 11 out of the past 20 presidential elections, and the governorship has been won by Democrats and independents three times each, and Republicans four times, since 1974. Maine has used the congressional district method for allocating electors in presidential elections continuously since the 1972 election. Despite this, the winner of the state won all the congressional districts until 2016, when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won all but the 2nd district, which she lost to Republican Donald Trump, who would later go on to win the election. Maine is the first and so far only state to have introduced ranked choice voting in elections, and is set to become the first to use it in a presidential election, in 2020.  Voting method  Maine used the first-past-the-post voting system for all elections until 2017, until it was replaced with ranked choice voting when the Ranked Choice Voting Act was signed, after previously being approved by voters in a referendum in on November 8th, 2016. The system was first used on June 12, 2018, in the primaries for the 2018 United States elections, and Maine became the first state to use ranked choice voting in a federal election on November 6th, 2018, when it was used in the main election itself. Since its enactment, numerous attempts have been made to repeal the act, or delay its effects. After the act was passed in 2016, legislators voted for the suspension of the law until December 2021.thus making it inoperative until the 2022 United States elections. This was subsequently vetoed by voters, who gathered enough signatures on a petition to allow the system to be used. The state's senate took legal action to attempt to disallow the petition, but the Maine Supreme Court issued a ruling enabling ranked choice voting to be used in the 2018 election. The Maine Republican party also attempted to block the use of the system in the 2020 United States elections via legal action, but the Maine Supreme Court dismissed the suit, which will make Maine the first state to use ranked choice voting in a presidential election.

As government bureaucrats, landlords and politicians, his descendants played an important role in the colonial history of Indonesia. History He was born in Tianbao of Zhangzhou, in Fujian province of Imperial China. Han was from a long line of scholar- officials. His first attested ancestor is Han Zhaode, a general in the army of the warlord Tan Goan-kong (died 711), who pacified Fujian for the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Han Siong Kong's branch of the family is descended from Han Hong, who received the degree of Metropolitan Graduate in the Imperial examination of 1121, then received an appointment as Secretary in the Ministry of Inland Revenue during the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Around 1700, Han Siong Kong left his native country for Lasem, a port on the north coast of Java island. By an unnamed woman of at least part-native ancestry, Han had five sons and four daughters. According to J. Hageman, Han's wife was the daughter of the regent of Rajegwesi (now part of Tegal regency). Two of their sons, Ngabehi Soero Pernollo and Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen, would play a significant role in establishing and consolidating Dutch colonial rule in East Java. Death Han Siong Kong died in 1743 in Rajegwesi, Central Java. Local legend has it that in the course of Han's funeral ceremony, there was a thunderstorm. As a result, Han's children abandoned their father's coffin in the forest in order to seek shelter.

Macracantha is notable for the extremely long, curved spines on the abdomens of female members of the genus; Eug√®ne Simon created the taxon name from the Greek words (large, long) and (spine). It occurs from India and China through Southeast Asia to Borneo. Description Female long-horned orb-weavers have tough, shell-like abdomens armed with three pairs of spines. The spectacular middle (median) spines project upward and outward, curving in toward each other along their length. They are up to three times as long (20-26 mm) as the abdomen is wide (8-9 mm). The front (anterior) and rear (posterior) spines are short, relatively inconspicuous, and roughly equal in length. The upper surface of the female abdomen ranges from yellow to red or even white or black and is marked with black sigilla. The ventral surface of the abdomen bears yellow or orange marks, and the median spines can show a bluish iridescence. The male of the species measures only 1.5 mm, with stout, conical spines. Taxonomy The taxon was first described by Eug√®ne Simon in 1864 as a subgenus of Gasteracantha, and was raised to genus status in 1974 by Michel Emerit. M. arcuata was historically included in the genus Gasteracantha. A 2019 study examining three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes found that M. arcuata is allied with Gasteracantha hasselti and Actinacantha globulata and that Gasteracantha is paraphyletic with respect to Macracantha, Actinacantha, and Thelacantha. The authors, however, did not propose generic reassignments based on their data. Possible additional species On Borneo, where M. arcuata occurs, multiple observers have also photographed a colorful and dramatically shaped taxon that differs from typical M. arcuata in several respects: * longer, more strongly curved median spines; * different shape and arrangement of sigilla along the rear edge of the abdomen; * much longer posterior spines; and * consistently white dorsal surface of abdomen. However, the World Spider Catalog lists only one species. Ecology Female M. arcuata build orb webs three or four feet wide in forested areas. These webs have hollow hubs and white silk beads on the radial threads. Siliwal and Molur report that females were more often observed on the underside of leaves near their webs than hanging in the center of the web. In Singapore, the species depends heavily on primary rainforest.

Lao Airlines provided flights from Vientiane via Pakse three times a week; however, it stopped them in October 2016 because of low passenger demand. The airport is located in Attapeu Province, which borders Vietnam and has seen greater commercial activity; however, it does not receive much tourism. History On 11 February 2012, officials of the Lao and Vietnamese governments attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the airport, which is located near the LaoVietnamese border. Construction began in May 2013 and ended in April 2015. Vietnam's Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group provided a loan of almost 300 billion kip (more than US$36.1 million) for the construction of the airport. The Attapeu airport officially opened on 30 May 2015 as the first international facility in the province. In June 2015, TTR Weekly reported that neither of the two airlines providing domestic flights in Laos, Lao Airlines and Lao Skyway, had shown interest in serving Attapeu. Lao Airlines had conducted a year-long survey but found little interest. Although Attapeu Province has seen increased economic activity because of its proximity to Vietnam, it has few tourist attractions. Nevertheless, Lao Airlines introduced twice-weekly flights from Vientiane via Pakse on 9 April 2016. The frequency was increased to thrice- weekly in July. However, Lao Airlines ended the route in October 2016 because of low passenger numbers. The following January, authorities closed down the airport for the time being. Infrastructure The Attapeu airport has one runway that measures . The terminal can handle 300 passengers per day. Access The airport is located along Route 18B in Saysetha District, roughly from Attapeu.

Hart. Historically, the downtown portion of Laura Street has been considered the financial district of Jacksonville.  Description  The street's contiguous segment runs from 12th Street in the historic neighborhood of Springfield south through downtown, terminating at Independent Drive. South of State Street, Laura Street runs through the core of downtown's Northbank, and is one of the busiest pedestrian streets in the city. Serving as an important corridor connecting a high concentration of office blocks, the area has historically functioned as a preeminent shopping and financial district, and has remained an important economic and cultural epicenter for the region. The street is also home to Jacksonville's oldest park, Hemming Park, the Jacksonville Landing, Main Public Library, the Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville, and City Hall.  History  Laura Street was named for the daughter of Jacksonville's founder, Isaiah D. Hart. In 1856, the city's oldest public park was designated along Laura Street, occupying the entire city block bordered by Monroe, Hogan and Duval Streets. The area attracted numerous hotels, most notably the St. James Hotel, completed in 1869, and the Windsor Hotel, completed in 1875. Laura Street in 1894 The Great Fire of 1901 ravaged almost the entirety of today's modern downtown core, including much of Laura Street. The street did act as a fire line between the junctions of Adams Street through to the St. Johns River. Just as in the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, the massive level of destruction left in the wake of the fire precipitated a robust period growth and a building boom that would last up until the Great Depression. The corridor between Adams Street, where a remaining portion of the business district still existed, and Hemming Park, was the center of much of the more notable commercial development. Postcard depicting the Financial Center of Jacksonville, c.1910 Originally the Mercantile Exchange Bank Building, one of the first buildings to be built after the fire was the Old Florida National Bank in 1902. It was designed by Edward H. Glidden in the Classical Revival style, and is now part of a group of buildings known as the Laura Street Trio. Architect Henry John Klutho designed the other two buildings: the Bisbee Building in 1908, and the Florida Life Building in 1911, both designed in the Chicago school of architecture. He also designed the YMCA Building in 1909, and the St. James Building in 1912. New York architecture firm Mowbray and Uffinger contributed two significant structures to the corridor during this period. In 1909, 121 Atlantic Place, originally Atlantic National Bank Building, opened as the tallest building in Florida. Barnett National Bank Building opened its doors in 1926, also breaking the state height record. Local architecture firm Marsh & Saxelbye also contributed multiple works along the route, including Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum (1921), Schultz Building (1926), Hotel George Washington (1926) and Greenleaf & Crosby Building (1928). RTKL Associates Inc., a planning and consultant firm from Baltimore, was hired in 1970 to study the city's increasing urban blight related to suburbanization and the development of retail malls. The recommendations were included in the 1971 Downtown Master Plan drafted by the Downtown Development Authority. The plans called for creating a pedestrian mall, a one-way transportation loop and elevated walkways that would permitting safe movement from the retail core, centered on Hemming Park, to the riverfront. The plans further called for a riverfront park, convention center with attached hotel, an exhibition center, Sears Department Store, and a high-rise offices. Though many portions of the plan never came to fruition, a few of Laura Street's features are a result of the 1971 Downtown Master Plan, the most striking of which was the Wells Fargo Center, designed by Kemp, Bunch & Jackson in 1974 for the Independent Life Insurance Company. In 2011, $2.3 million was spent to enhance the street by adding traffic calming features, more sidewalk space, trees with colorful uplighting and other hardscape features. In 2015, a five-block segment of Laura Street beginning at West Duval Street near Hemming Park, stretching to the Jacksonville Landing, and ending at East Independent Drive, was recognized by the American Planning Association as one of its \\"Great Places in America.\\"  Notable places  SunTrust Tower From south to north: * Jacksonville Landing and Andrew Jackson Statue, Independent Drive * SunTrust Tower, Independent Drive * Wells Fargo Center, between Independent Drive and Bay Street * Bank of America Tower, between Bay and Forsyth Streets * CenterState Bank Building, Forsyth Street * 121 Atlantic Place, Forsyth Street * Laura Street Trio, Forsyth Street * Barnett National Bank Building, Adams Street * Greenleaf & Crosby Building and Jacobs Jewelers Clock, Adams Street * Elks Club Building, Adams Street * The Carling, Adams Street * Schultz Building, Adams Street * Snyder Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church, Monroe Street * Main branch of the Jacksonville Public Library, Monroe Street * Hemming Park, between Monroe and Duval Streets * Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville, Duval Street * City Hall (St. James Building), between Duval and Church Streets * Florida State College at Jacksonville downtown campus, between State and 1st Streets * Karpeles Manuscript Library Museum, 1st Street * Klutho Park, 1st Street  Transportation  The Jacksonville Landing is at the southern terminus of Laura Street and offers access to the Jacksonville Water Taxi as well as other marine services.

Yamuna lake) is an ancient pond situated in Nallur, Jaffna, Sri Lanka. In 1948, it was listed as one of the protected archaeological monuments in the Jaffna District by the Sri Lankan government. One of the ruins of the Jaffna kingdom, Yamuna Eri is located near the Mantri Manai palace and the Cankilian Thoppu arch. According to the chronological historical book Yalpana Vaipava Malai, it was built during the reign of Jaffna Kingdom King Cinkai Ariyan Cekaracacekaran I (1215‚Äì1240). The text describes the King bringing sacred water from India's Yamuna River and mixing it with the water in the pond. > Original text: Translation: ...he afterwards built the city of Nallur with > all its ramparts, gates, mansions, palaces, towers, flower-gardens, baths, > stables for elephants and horses, halls of justice, pleasure-houses, > dwellings for Brahmans and warriors.... He dug a three-sided well with whose > water, he mixed water brought from the sacred river Yamunai. The Yalpana Vaipava Malai is contradicted by another source, however, which suggests that the pond was built by a later king, Singai Pararasasegaram (1478‚Äì1519). In either case, the pond derives its name from the Indian river from which sacred waters were brought. The pond is built as a \\"three-sided well\\", in the shape of the Tamil letter, \\"‡Æ™\\", and was made in brick with stone steps that were built to reach both the inside and the outside, allowing for convenient bathing. There is a decorative flower garden located in the centre. Local legends have it that Yamuna Eri was used by the Queen of Jaffna Kingdom, and was linked to Mantri Manai (\\"the minister's palace\\") by an underground tunnel. A similar legend has Tamil Kings and royal families using the pond. Yet another legend has the pond being used for offering ritual baths to the idol of Kartikeya, the primary deity of the Nallur Kandaswamy temple.

Newton was born in Congleton, Cheshire; his father, William Newton, was an engineer. He completed an apprenticeship in engineering in Etruria, Staffordshire. In 1840, he joined the Journeymen Steam Engine and Machine Makers' Society, and moved to London soon afterwards.Alastair J. Reid. \\"Newton, William\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Newton continued to work in engineering in London, becoming a foreman, but he was sacked in 1848 for his trade union activities. He became the manager of a pub in Ratcliff Cross, and turned it into a base for the Steam Engine Makers. Working with William Allan, he proposed merging the many small craft unions to form a large body. This was achieved in 1851, with the establishment of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE), and Newton then published and edited The Operative, a newspaper linked with the new union. Newton also served on the ASE's executive, and introduced a motion for members to stop working overtime and piece-work. This was passed, and led to a major lock-out in 1852. During the lock-out, Newton toured the country giving speeches, but the action was eventually lost. Newton left the union's executive and began instead promoting the creation of producer co-operatives, although he continued to speak in support of the principle of trade unionism. He was also influenced by William James Linton's republicanism.Francis Barrymore Smith, Radical Artisan, p.107 At the 1852 United Kingdom general election, Newton stood as an independent Chartist candidate in Tower Hamlets. The first independent candidate from the labour movement in the UK, he took more than 1,000 votes but last place in the poll. Encouraged by his performance, he proposed creating a national political party to campaign for universal male suffrage. Although there was some interest in his proposal, the national Chartist leadership rejected the idea. Newton then devoted much of his time to newspaper publication: firstly, The Englishman, then from 1858 to 1876, the East London Observer. He was also elected as president of the Labour Representation League. He was elected to serve on the Stepney vestry, later becoming its chairman, and the Mile End Old Town representative on the Metropolitan Board of Works. He stood again for Parliament in Tower Hamlets at the 1868 United Kingdom general election, this time as a radical aligned with the Liberal Party, and finally at the 1876 Ipswich by-election, but came bottom of the poll on each occasion. He married Emma n√©e Baxter, the daughter of a labourer, in 1842. The couple had a daughter. He became ill with Bright's disease and other problems, and died in London in 1876.

It aired on Fox in the United States on January 15, 2017, and is written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by Jerry Langford. In this episode, New England Patriots player Rob Gronkowski (guest starring as himself) moves into the Griffins' neighborhood and instantly befriends Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe, inviting them to parties every day. In the episode subplot, Brian and Stewie take up beekeeping. Plot After one of Peter Griffin's neighbors is found killed by a cat, he gains a new neighbor in the form of Rob Gronkowski, his brothers, and his dad where their antics start to annoy Peter. Meanwhile, Stewie and Brian make honey to sell at the Quahog Farmer's Market. It's such a success that he has to give his bees steroids to produce more. The bees gain super strength and attack Brian and Stewie, but they trick the bees into attacking Gronkowski instead. The attack causes Gronkowski and his family to move out of Quahog much to the relief of Peter and his friends. Later, it's reported that Gronkowski was suspended from the New England Patriots due to testing positive for steroids. However, Gronkowski pitches a bus through the roof of the Griffin home in revenge. Reception The episode received an audience of 3.55 million viewers, a decrease from the previous episode, and making it the third-most watched show of the night, behind The Mick and The Simpsons.

Described as a \\"cycle of bubblegum pop songs,\\" the album's lo-fi sound draws on sources such as 1980s pop culture tropes, B-movies, and glam punk. It garnered generally favorable reviews from music journalists, and was called a \\"weirdo masterpiece of the 21st century\\" by Impose. Composition In an interview, Ferraro claimed he had gotten into \\"weird street fashion\\" while recording Night Dolls with Hairspray, which led the record to be influenced by glam rock and power pop styles.Cornwell, Samantha (January 3, 2011). \\"Artist Profile: James Ferraro\\". Archived from the original on January 11, 2011. Altered Zones. Pitchfork Media. Retrieved January 15, 2017. Of the record's concept, Ferraro explained: \\"the idea itself was basically just private material, just fooling around. I was really inspired to try to make just weird B-movie style trash.\\" Most of Night Dolls with Hairspray involves Ferraro exaggeratedly singing in falsetto. Ferraro reasoned that the singing style was \\"silly\\" and \\"harmless,\\" and led the album to sound \\"cool\\" and \\"futuristic.\\"\\"James Ferraro interview: \\"The city of dream.\\". Dummy.

Pitchfork described the album's overall instrumentation as consisting of \\"plunging bass lines, warped guitar riffs, and crooning vocals\\" that \\"bounce around the stereo space like lasers in a hall of mirrors.\\" A reviewer for Playground magazine described the tracks as \\"fragmentary songs,\\" in that it feels like each track cuts to different songs; this \\"collage effect\\" is an essential part of hypnagogic pop, in that the variety of 1980s musical styles serve as an \\"exercise in nostalgia.\\" According to FACT, Night Dolls with Hairspray explores the surfaces of popular media in the 1980s.Richardson, Nick (January 5, 2011). \\"James Ferraro: Night Dolls with Hairspray\\".

In doing so, Ferraro creates new bad behaviors to scenarios that are common in B movies released in the decade, wrote Nick Richardson of FACT. \\"Leather High School\\" takes place in a 1980s high school movie situation, but adds a sexual context that would not be present in most movies of this genre released in the decade. As Ferraro sings, \\"The principal‚Äôs wearing panties under his suit / they‚Äôre taking him down to the boiler room. They‚Äôre going to whip him till he bleeds.\\" \\"Buffy Honkerburg‚Äôs Answering Machine\\" involves the singer as a stalker nerd sending lewd messages to a cheerleader in a slasher film scenario. Richardson analyses that there are also interludes that are \\"disorienting amalgams of gross-out sound effects, shortwave radio noise, advertising jingles and cartoon theme tunes,\\" which all represent the negative by-products of the entertainment coummunity that the album mocks. Night Dolls with Hairspray also focuses on how most people positively view an otherwise bad entertainment industry in the present time, where \\"real teenagers, like Ferraro records, are smelly, acnefied, confused; while Beyonce is a slick, inhuman cyborg,\\" writes Richardson. He also analyzes that the album \\"reflects a fantastical vision of the present that‚Äôs out of date and crumbling as soon as it‚Äôs realised ‚Äì even as the vision hairpins to a blemishless space of muscled, digital geometry.\\" Critical reception An Impose magazine journalist called Night Dolls with Hairspray a \\"weirdo masterpiece of the 21st century.\\"Krinsley, Jeremy (February 9, 2011). \\"New James Ferraro, \\"Tabloid 2\\".

The family originated in Normandy and as Earls, held land there and throughout England. When the senior male- line ended in the mid-12th century, the descendants of their heiress adopted the Warenne surname and continue as Earls of Surrey for another two centuries. Several junior lines also held land or prominent offices in England and Normandy. Etymology The Warenne family derived their toponymic surname from the village of Varenne, river Varenne, near Arques-la-Bataille, Duchy of Normandy, now in the canton of Bellencombre, Seine Maritime.K.S.B. Keats- Rohan, Domesday People, a Prosopography of Persons Occurring in English Documents 1066-1166 (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 1999), p. 480.Lewis C.

Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, Vol. XII/1 (London: The St. Catherine Press, 1953), p. 491. Origin William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey is accepted as having been son of a Norman named Ranulf de Warenne,C. P. Lewis, \\"Warenne, William (I) de, first earl of Surrey (d. 1088)\\" (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) Retrieved 6 April 2017. but the early Anglo-Norman chroniclers gave confusing and contradictory accounts of the origins and relatives of this family. In his additions to the Gesta Normannorum Ducum of William of Jumi√®ges, chronicler Robert of Torigny reported that William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, and Anglo-Norman baron Roger of Mortemer were brothers, both sons of an unnamed niece of Gunnor, Duchess of Normandy, making the family akin to her great-grandson, William the Conqueror. Unfortunately, Robert's genealogies are somewhat confused, and he elsewhere makes Roger a son of William de Warenne, and yet again makes both the sons of Walter de Saint Martin. Likewise, several of the descents Robert gives for Gunnor's family appear to contain too few generations.K. S. B. Keats-Rohan, \\"Aspects of Torigny's Genealogy Revisited\\", Nottingham Medieval Studies 37:21‚Äì27 Orderic Vitalis describes William as Roger's consanguineus, literally \\"cousin\\" but more generically a term of close kinship that is not typically used to describe brothers, and Roger de Mortemer appears to have been a generation older than William de Warenne.Lewis C. Loyd, \\"The Origins of the Family of Warenne\\", Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, 31:97‚Äì113 Charters report several earlier men associated with Warenne. A Radulf de Warenne appears in two charters, one dated between 1027 and 1035, with a second dating from about 1050 and also naming his wife, Beatrice. A Roger son of Radulf de Warenne appears in a charter dated 1040/1053. In 1059, a Radulf appears with his wife Emma and their sons Radulf and William. These occurrences have historically been interpreted as representing a single Radulf with successive wives, with Beatrice being the mother of William and hence identical to Gunnor's unnamed niece.Thomas Stapleton, \\"Observations in disapproval of a pretended marriage of William de Warren, earl of Surrey with a daughter ... of William the Conqueror\\", Archaeological Journal, 3:1‚Äì12G. H. White, \\"The Sisters and Nieces of Gunnor, Duchess of Normandy\\", Genealogist, n. s. 37:57‚Äì65 However, the 1059 charter explicitly names Emma as William's mother. A reevaluation of the evidence led Katherine Keats-Rohan to suggest that the traditional view has mistakenly compressed two distant men of the same name into a single chimeric individual. She sees the earliest known family members as Radulf (I) and his wife Beatrice. Associations with the village of Vasc≈ìuil led Keats-Rohan to identify the latter with a 1054/60 widow, Beatrice, daughter of Tesselin, vicomte of Rouen, and since another Rouen vicomte married a niece of Gunnor, this may represent the connection to the ducal family to which Robert de Torigny alluded. Keats-Rohan sees Radulf (I) and Beatrice as parents of a Radulf (II) and Roger de Mortimer, with Radulf (II) in turn being the 1059 husband of Emma and by her father of Radulf (III), the heir in Normandy, and Earl William. Earldom William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey (died 1088), fought for William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and after was made the first Earl of Surrey with land in Surrey and twelve other counties. The family was based in Lewes, Sussex and had castles in Yorkshire, Normandy, and Reigate Castle in Surrey. An account of the life of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (1088-1138) known as the Warenne Chronicle was written shortly after 1157, probably for his granddaughter Isabel de Warenne, Countess of Surrey and her husband William of Blois, Count of Boulogne.. He had a brother Ralph who joined in charters with the 1st and 2nd Earls in the 1130s and 1140s, including a donations to Longueville and Bellencombe Priories, near Rouen, Normandy, and to the family's foundation, Lewes Priory in Sussex, England, the latter being secured with a lock of hair from his own and from Ralph's head cut by Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester, before the altar of the priory church. The family held the Earldom of Surrey for three generations, before William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey, died on crusade in 1148, leaving an only daughter and heiress, who married successively William of Blois, the son of King Stephen, and Hamelin, illegitimate half-brother of king Henry II. The latter adopted the Warenne surname and give rise to a second line of Surrey Earls that lasted until the death of John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey in 1347, when Surrey passed via his sister to the FitzAlan Earls of Arundel.  Other branches  Esneval A likely brother of the 1st Earl of Surrey, another Rodulf, held lands that had been held by his father in the Pays de Caux and near Rouen. By 1172, these lands were in possession of Robert d'Esneval as a part of the barony of Esneval, and it is supposed that the family d'Esneval may derive from an heiress of this Rodulf's line. Whitchurch Among the holdings of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey was some land in Whitchurch, Shropshire, and this likely led to his kin becoming its early lords. A William fitz Ranulf is recorded as the lord of Whitchurch, first appearing in 1176, and was ancestor of a family that sometimes were called de Warenne, along with de Whitchurch, de Blancminster, and de Albo Monasterio.. Robert Eyton considered it likely that Ralph de Warenne, son of William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, was the father of this William, and that Ralph had likely been lord before William fitz Ranulf. It is known that Ralph de Warenne had a son named William, who confirmed and expanded a donation of Norfolk land that his father had made to made to Lewes Priory, and that the Whitchurch heirs likewise maintained an association with Lewes. Writing in 1923, William Farrer agreed. However, in a later publication Charles Travis Clay elaborated on Farrer's original work and drew attention to a Domesday tenant of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, named Ranulf nepos (nephew). It does not specify of whom he was nephew, but Clay suggests it was his feudal overlord, Earl William. This Ranulf nepos held Middleton, Suffolk, which was later owned by William fitz Ranulf, Lord of Whitchurch, leading Clay to speculate that the Warennes of Whitchurch may instead have descended from this Domesday tenant rather than from the son of the 2nd Earl. William, son of William fitz Ranulf of Whitchurch, left a sole daughter and heiress, from whom the Whitchurch inheritance passed to Robert l'Estrange. Eyton suggested that Griffith de Warenne, the 13th century founder of the Warrens of Ightfield, Shropshire, was son of William fitz Ranulf de Warenne of Whitchurch. Wormegay Reginald de Warenne, younger brother of the 3rd Earl, married the heiress of Wormegay, Norfolk. His son William de Warenne of Wormegay was a royal justice under Richard I and John. After his death in 1209, Wormegay passed with his daughter to the Bardolf family.  Earls of Surrey  The Warenne Earls were called Earl de Warenne at least as often as Earl of Surrey; but they received the 'third penny' of Surrey. This means that they were entitled to one third of the county court fines. The numbering of the earls follows the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; some sources number Isabel's husbands as the fourth and fifth earls, increasing the numbering of the later earls by one. * William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey (died 1088) * William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (died 1138), earldom attainted in 1101, restored 1103 * William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey (1119‚Äì1148) * Isabel de Warenne, Countess of Surrey (died 1203) ** William I, Count of Boulogne, Earl of Surrey (c. 1137‚Äì1159), her first husband, younger son of King Stephen of England. ** Hamelin de Warenne, Earl of Surrey (died 1202), her second husband, illegitimate son of Geoffrey of Anjou.

On 16 January 2017, the Boeing 747-400F flying the route crashed in a residential area while attempting to land in thick fog at Manas International Airport, Bishkek. A total of 39 people ‚Äì all four crew members on board and 35 residents on the ground ‚Äì were killed. The subsequent investigation found that the aircraft failed to properly acquire the instrument landing system's signal, remaining significantly higher than the correct approach path while overflying the entire length of the runway; it then collided with houses seconds after initiating a go-around. Accident At 07:19 local time (01:19 UTC) on 16 January 2017, the aircraft crashed nearly 1 km beyond the end of runway 26 at Manas International Airport, in thick fog. According to initial reports, the aircraft failed to gain enough altitude while attempting a go-around. It crashed into terrain and destroyed several houses. Kyrgyz authorities later stated that the crew were making a determined attempt to land the aircraft instead of aborting the landing. A total of 39 people were killed in the crash: all four crew members and 35 residents of Dacha-SU (), a residential area located approximately to the west of the airport. Among the dead were 17 children. Witnesses and rescuers reported that they found the pilot still conscious strapped into his seat, from which he had to be cut free. He later died while en route to a hospital. Fourteen people on the ground were injured, including a number of children.Preliminary report, pages 7,11 Nineteen houses were destroyed at the crash site, and a further seven were damaged. Manas International Airport was closed, with all flights cancelled, following the accident.  Aircraft  TC- MCL, the Boeing 747 involved, photographed five days before the accident The aircraft involved was a Boeing 747-412F,The aircraft was a Boeing 747-400F model; the \\"F\\" denoting that the aircraft was the freighter variant of the 747-400. Boeing assigns a unique code for each company that buys one of its aircraft, which is applied as an infix to the model number at the time the aircraft is built, hence \\"747-412F\\". registered as TC-MCL and with manufacturer's serial number 32897. The plane entered service with Singapore Airlines Cargo in 2003, with the registration 9V-SFL. After multiple periods of storage, the aircraft was acquired by Istanbul-based cargo company ACT Airlines in 2015, which then began operating it on behalf of Turkish Cargo. The aircraft had flown a total of over 45,000 hours and 8,000 cycles as of June 2016. Its last C-check maintenance check had been completed on 6 November 2015. Immediate response Deputy Prime Minister Mukhammedkalyi Abulgaziyev reported that, by late morning, more than 1,000 rescue workers were at the scene. Minister of Health Talantbek Batyraliyev reported that by 11:46 a.m. local time, around 56 doctors and psychologists and 14 ambulance crews had been dispatched to the scene. A number of heads of state expressed condolences, including the presidents of the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Prime Minister of Turkey. The following day was declared a day of national mourning in Kyrgyzstan. Investigation The location of the crash (red square) past the end of runway 26 at Manas Airport The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Kyrgyzstan's Emergency Situations Minister, Kubatbek Boronov, stated that it was foggy at Manas at the time of the crash, but that weather conditions were not critical. By the afternoon of 16 January, one of the two flight recorders had been found, and the other was located later in the recovery process. Both the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were damaged in the crash, but investigators were still able to retrieve data from both recorders. Deputy Prime Minister Abulgaziyev suggested that the cause may have been pilot error, noting that eleven aircraft had landed safely, despite the same weather conditions, on the previous day. He added that the aircraft had attempted to land twice and had damaged the runway lights at one stage. This statement was at odds with another official statement that the aircraft crashed during its first landing attempt. The Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC or MAK) of the Commonwealth of Independent States opened a technical investigation.\\"Boeing 747-412F TC-MCL 16.01.2017.\\" Interstate Aviation Committee. Retrieved on February 5, 2017. Engine debris from TC-MCL still at the crash site five months after the accident The Turkish Transportation Ministry said it had sent two experts from its accident investigation board to Bishkek to assist Kyrgyz authorities. A Boeing technical team travelled to the accident site to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of the American accident investigation body, the National Transportation Safety Board. Many initial press responses stated that a Turkish Airlines aircraft was involved in the accident. In response, Turkish Airlines released a statement saying that neither the aircraft nor the crew were part of the airline, calling it an \\"ACT Airlines accident\\". Journalists were threatened by Turkish lawyers claiming reputational damage. Nevertheless, the flight was operated under a Turkish Airlines flight number. The preliminary investigation report found that the aircraft descended late and captured a false glideslope. On capturing the false glide slope, the 3 auto pilots then initiated the descent of the plane in low visibility conditions. Initially all three auto pilots were engaged (LAND 3) the false glideslope was lost 15 seconds after it was acquired and AP CAUTION and FMA FAULT 2 events were recorded meaning that the auto pilots would continue to descend the aircraft on a 3 degree slope using inertial guidance. One autopilot disengaged (LAND 2) and the remaining auto pilots flew down to the decision height. The crew did not acquire the required visual reference at the decision height (99 ft) and initiated a go-around 1/2 second later at 58 ft radar altitude by pressing the TOGA switches. Given the slightly up-sloping terrain after the end of the runway, the aircraft did not have sufficient height at that point to climb out safely. On 2 February 2020, the IAC released the final report on the accident. The flight crew had failed to keep track of the aircraft's position on the correct glideslope and only initiated a go-around after the aircraft had deviated off course, the pre- flight briefing was insufficient, the crew did not decrease the aircraft's height so it could reach the required approach point on the navigation chart, the air traffic controllers failed to use equipment to monitor the aircraft's position, the flight crew experienced stress, and other factors.  Aftermath  The crash site of TC-MCL six months after the accident On 17 January 2017, the Kyrgyz press reported that ACT Airlines had declared the intent to pay the victims compensation for all material and immaterial losses, citing a press release on the ACT Airlines web site. The press release itself, however, stated only that losses were covered by insurance.

New Wine (Episode 3)  The third episode of the documentary trilogy focuses on the intangible elements wine presents that resemble man‚Äôs invisible nature. Tom Harpur, Toronto Star journalist and author of The Spirituality of Wine and Water into Wine, discusses the symbolic meaning of pruning and grape crushing, the importance of tending 'the vineyard in one's heart,' the connection between spirituality and nature, and the modern-day relevance of the Biblical expression, 'new wine in old wineskins.' Representatives of the Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Catholic faiths - Chuck Cody, pastor and wine judge, Ernie Weir, Napa Valley maker of kosher wine, Dr. Mustafa Kuko, director of the Islamic Center of Riverside, and Abbott Thomas Davis of New Clairvaux Abbey, where members of the Cistercian order harvest grapes and make tempranillo wine ‚Äì discuss the symbolic meaning of wine in their respective faiths.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Evan-Thomas, to the north. Like so many of the mountains in Kananaskis Country, Mount Brock received its name from the persons and ships involved in the 1916 Battle of Jutland, the only major sea battle of the First World War. History The mountain was named in honor of Rear Admiral Osmond de Beauvoir Brock (1869-1947), who served on during the Battle of Jutland in World War I. The mountain's name was made official in 1922 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1954 by P.J.B. Duffy, and K. Ingold. Geology Mount Brock is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Brock is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 C. In terms of favorable weather, June through September are the best months to climb Mount Brock. Precipitation runoff from the west side of the mountain drains into the Kananaskis River, the east side drains into tributaries of the Elbow River, and then both of these merge into the Bow River, and finally into the Saskatchewan River.

Pacific Fur Company Of his final employers, Reed's final one was the Pacific Fur Company (PFC). He was hired at Mackinac Island as a clerk in August 1810. From there he joined Wilson Price Hunt and the other members of an expedition bound for the Columbia River. An advanced party of PFC administrators and laborers was planned to arrive on board the Tonquin, leaving New York City in September 1810. This second group was to begin a company headquarters prior Hunt's arrival from the United States. The party Reed joined was largely composed of French-Canadian and M√©tis subjects of the United Kingdom, in addition to a number of Americans. The group arrived at the newly established Fort Astoria in January 1812. He was given important documents by the management of the PFC in March, with orders to return overland and deliver them directly to John Jacob Astor. He and the few men with him were attacked in the interior by a group of natives prior to crossing the Continental Divide. Wounded in the engagement, he was about to get medical attention at Fort Okanogan. Reed later returned to Fort Astoria in May 1812. Reed opened a dwelling in 1813 along the Malheur River in the vicinity of modern Vale, Oregon. He later relocated to the junction of the Boise and Snake Rivers. In the first month of 1814, an attack on the post by a group of Bannock natives and killed Reed and two men there. An outpost some distance away maintained by the trappers was also attacked. Four PFC employees were killed there, including Pierre Dorion Jr., though his wife Marie Aioe Dorion and two infant children survived. Marie survived the winter alone and took care of the two children until she reached Fort Okanogan in the spring. Legacy The general area of the Reed's second post was found to be valuable by later trappers. In 1819 Donald McKenzie opened a new station there, though it was later abandoned. Thomas McKay later established Fort Boise in 1835, within the coral of McKenzie's old station.

Sea turtles need to reach the surface to breathe, and therefore many drown once caught. Loggerhead and hawksbill turtles are particularly vulnerable. Nearly all species of sea turtle are classified as Endangered. They are killed for their eggs, meat, skin and shells. They also face habitat destruction. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites. As fishing activity expands, this threat is more of a problem.  Endangered Species Act  The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA; 16 U.S.C. ¬ß 1531 et seq.) is one of the dozens of US environmental laws passed in the 1970s, and serves as the enacting legislation to carry out the provisions outlined in The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Designed to protect critically imperiled species from extinction, it was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 28, 1973. The U.S. Supreme Court found that \\"the plain intent of Congress in enacting\\" the ESA \\"was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost.\\" The Act is administered by two federal agencies, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Endangered marine turtles  Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed beak. They also have a distinctive pattern of overlapping scales on their shells that form a serrated-look on the edges. These colored and patterned shells make them highly-valuable and commonly sold as \\"tortoiseshell\\" in markets. The green turtle is one of the largest sea turtles and the only herbivore among the different species. Green turtles are in fact named for the greenish color of their cartilage and fat, not their shells. Loggerhead turtles are named for their large heads that support powerful jaw muscles, allowing them to crush hard-shelled prey like clams and sea urchins. They are less likely to be hunted for their meat or shell compared to other sea turtles. Bycatch, the accidental capture of marine animals in fishing gear, is a serious problem for loggerhead turtles because they frequently come in contact with fisheries.  Threats  Worldwide, hundreds of thousands of sea turtles a year are accidentally caught in shrimp trawl nets, on longline hooks and in fishing gillnets‚Äîa threat known as bycatch. Sea turtles need to reach the surface to breathe, and therefore many drown once caught. Loggerheads are highly migratory and are very likely to come in contact with a fishery, particularly in shrimp gill nets and long lines. [2] Climate change, also called global warming, refers to the rise in average surface temperatures on Earth. An overwhelming scientific consensus maintains that climate change is due primarily to the human use of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. The gases trap heat within the atmosphere, which can have a range of effects on ecosystems, including rising sea levels, severe weather events, and droughts that render landscapes more susceptible to wildfires. Overfishing Human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Nearly all species of sea turtle are classified as Endangered. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites. It alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. Hawksbills are particularly susceptible to entanglement in gillnets and accidental capture on fishing hooks. Sea turtles need to reach the surface to breathe, and therefore many drown once caught. Known as bycatch, this is a serious threat to hawksbill turtles. As fishing activity expands, this threat is more of a problem.

Originally from Yunnan province, he served as Communist Party Secretary of the Tibetan capital Lhasa between 2012 and 2017. Since October 2017, he is the member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Career Che Dalha was born in Zhongdian County, Yunnan (later renamed Shangri-La). He left school at age 10 to herd animals in his home village. He completed primary school and high school by teaching himself. In 1979, he participated in the civil service examinations of Zhongdian County with good results, and was given a minor post in the Communist Youth League as a rural functionary. In 1983, the 25-year-old Che Dalha became the Communist Youth League Secretary of Zhongdian County. He would progressively ascend the ranks of the Communist Party hierarchy, serving as the Deputy Party Secretary, then Party Secretary of Zhongdian County. Between 1994 and 2001, Che Dalha was instrumental in bringing the \\"Shangri-la\\" brand to life in Zhongdian County, making the area a major tourist destination. In 2001, the year he was promoted to Governor of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Zhongdian County was officially renamed Shangri-La by directive of the State Council. In 1996 he attended to Yunnan Nationalities University, and graduated in 1998 with a degree in economic management specializing in ethnic minority affairs; he also has a bachelor's degree from the Central Party School in political and legal affairs. In Diqing, Che Dalha was credited with making the region the \\"best Tibetan region in China\\" as documented by Chinese official sources. He was elected a provincial party standing committee member in Yunnan province in 2010, ascending to sub-provincial ranks. In September 2010, Che Dalha was appointed as the Head of the United Front Work Department in Tibet Autonomous Region, and he was elected as the Vice Chairman of the Tibet People's Political Consultative Conference in 2011. In 2012, he was appointed as the Party Secretary of Tibetan capital Lhasa; the move was welcomed by some Lhasa residents because Che Dalha had replaced a Han Chinese, Qin Yizhi, in the post. In his capacity as party chief of Lhasa, he visited Chicago and met with U.S. Senator Mark Kirk. His tenure in Lhasa was largely defined by the modernization of the cityscape. On 15 January 2017, Che Dalha was appointed Chairman of Tibet Autonomous Region, succeeding Losang Jamcan. He was the ninth ethnic Tibetan to assume the post after the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution, and the first Chairman from Yunnan province. He was additionally the first Chairman of the region to have not been born in the Tibet Autonomous Region in some twenty years.

Translated by Joseph D. O'Neil, Minneapolis/London: University of Minnesota Press. as well as evolutionary psychologyDunbar, Robin (1998). The social brain hypothesis. Evolutionary Anthropology, 23, 178‚Äì190.. Person-centered systems theory is, as Kriz emphasizes, neither a method nor a toolbox of methods. Its aim is to provide a theoretical foundation for integrating the valuable contributions of individual \\"schools\\" with more recent findings from other scientific disciplines. Four process levels At the center of the person-centered systems theory is the human being in their everyday world with the necessary interest in creating a tangible, meaningfully organized world from the incomprehensible complexity of a (physico-chemical) stimulus world. Kriz assigns the multitude of relevant processes to four process levels. However, he underlines that this is a purely analytical distinction, because influences from all four process levels on living and acting are effective at every moment. In addition, further processes may be distinguished depending on the respective question. The following four levels are to be regarded as the minimum of what must be taken into account in order not to systematically disregard essential effects. a) Psychological processes This is the main level on which people generate meaning and significance. Humans are connected to the world through perceptions and actions; through thought and emotive processes they evaluate these processes and can observe themselves. b) Interpersonal processes This level deals with micro-social structures of couples, families or teams for whom face-to-face communication is typical. Terms such as \\"interaction patterns\\" or \\"communicative structures\\" indicate that the meaning of expressions and their contribution to mutual cooperation are negotiated in joint interaction. Everybody believes to know the expectations of the others and is influenced or even guided by these expectations.Mead, George Herbert (1925). The Genesis of Self and Social Control. International Journal of Ethics 35, 251‚Äì277. The Mead Project. Retrieved 2020-07-04. It is a network of mutual insinuations that stabilizes \\"reality\\" even when much of it is not true. Since these tacit assumptions are rarely talked about, the chances of correction are rather low. Everyday experience, as well as research, show how people often experience themselves as victims of others or of circumstances, although they themselves (unconsciously) contribute to maintaining this pattern. Psychotherapy, counseling, and coaching usually look at the processes on levels (a) and (b) and often also at their interactions. However, the influences of two other process levels are largely neglected: c) Cultural processes Usually, people have not ‚Äì neither individually nor interpersonally ‚Äì invented the meaning of words and sentences, the expectations of fellow human beings, the inner images, \\"how living together works\\", and so on. Rather, different cultures and subcultures convey meanings that significantly influence the processes of (a) and (b). Clues about the meaning of events in the \\"here and now\\" are deduced from the media, conversation with colleagues at work, and from other non-family sources. These influences remain to a large extent unconscious. The impact of the cultural level, which constantly affects people, is by no means limited to cultural events ‚Äì i.e. to what is happening in organizations, in legislation, or in the mass media. Rather, the socio- cultural aspects essentially concern the way in which persons see and understand themselves, their fellow human beings, and the \\"world\\". This becomes particularly clear when considering the interdependencies of levels (a) and (c): If human beings want to understand themselves in their feelings, thoughts and actions, then they have to use the \\"cultural tools\\" of their social environment. This is especially true when it comes to their very own, innermost \\"subjective\\" processes (affects, perceptions, etc.). The effects of the cultural process level remain largely hidden from everyday consciousness. They are, however, essential components of the structures in human expectations of the world and of others as well as their own expectations of what others expect of them. d) Bodily processes In accordance with Ciompi's affect logic, Kriz highlights that at any given moment both cognitive-psychic and affective processes occur simultaneously in the human organism. Because of the slower change of biochemical parameters, the affective processes form the framework for the rapidly changing cognitive processes with their bioelectric basis. Furthermore, the implicit knowledge of the human organism, which originates from early experiences as well as from evolutionary preformations, is of great relevance. This has long been underestimated, but is now discussed under the term \\"social brain\\". Humans are hardly aware of many of these structuring effects of the bodily processes on what is described under (a) and (b). Nevertheless ‚Äì or precisely because of this ‚Äì these processes have a very strong effect. Stability, instability, and the interaction of the four process levels Kriz understands symptoms and problems with which people come into psychotherapy, counseling, or coaching as over-stable process patterns. These were mostly appropriate and functional in earlier stages of development, but have not adapted to new conditions. This is because human development ‚Äì both at the level of the individual and in social systems ‚Äì consists of repeatedly abandoning effective process patterns whenever new developmental challenges arise. For example, different patterns of interaction are required at the family level depending on whether a child has just been born, is in kindergarten or school, reaches puberty, is starting professional training, and so on. The same applies to the organization of the psychological processes of the child itself. Also, companies have to change their structure and processes because the business environment is constantly evolving.In organizations and management, this is discussed under the collective term of change management. Meaning attractors For psychotherapy, counseling, and coaching, the question of stability ‚Äì or over- stability ‚Äì as well as change and new adaptation is essential. The model for understanding these phenomena is the interdisciplinary systems theory of synergetics, which in turn derives from the theory of non-linear dynamic systems. It deals with self-organization processes in which a large number of components form orders or patterns which then react upon the further developmental dynamics of the components. Such dynamic stabilities or orders are called attractors. Person-centered systems theory though is not concerned with phenomena for which energetic processes are important. Rather, it is about psychosocial phenomena of the natural sciences for which sense and meaning are essential. Kriz, therefore, uses a structural-scientific version of synergetics as a model basis.Kriz, J√ºrgen; Tschacher, Wolfgang (2013). Systemtheorie als Strukturwissenschaft: Vermittlerin zwischen Praxis und Forschung (Systems theory as structural science: mediator between practice and research). Familiendynamik, 38 (2), S. 12‚Äì21. He specifies the attractors as meaning attractors (German: Sinnattraktor), which he describes as reduction of the vast possibilities of understanding and communication providing certainty and stability while limiting change, adaptation, and creativity. Accordingly, the task of psychotherapy, counseling, and coaching would be to support the change of over-stable meaning attractors (which show up as symptoms and problems in psychological and interactive processes) in their adaptation to developmental tasks. This takes place in a phase transition ‚Äì a transition from one state of order to another. Symptomatic or painful orders are destabilized so that new orders can emerge that are better able to cope with the new conditions. Bottom-up und Top-down Stability, instability, and order-order transitions (phase transitions) can be described in detail within the framework of synergetics. Self-organized orders or attractors thus arise from feedback processes between a micro and a macro level. In terms of perception, this has been illustrated by Gestalt psychology already a hundred years ago using the phenomenon of a \\"melody\\". A melody emerges \\"bottom-up\\" from tones. At the same time, however, this melody affects the perception of the tones \\"top-down\\". For example, one and the same physical tone is perceived either as a \\"soothing tonic\\" or as a \\"tension-laden dominant\\", depending on the context of the melody. Similarly, words create certain meaningful connections with another person (bottom-up), whereby the meaning of further words is understood in the context of these connections (top-down). Complex interaction The basic conditions for self-organized orders (i.e. the attractors) are set by the environment of a system. In person-centered systems theory, the environmental conditions are represented on each level by the respective other levels, which results in a complex interaction of all levels. Complementarity of objective and subjective perspectives Kriz emphasizes the relevance of a distinction between objective and subjective perspectives and at the same time highlights their complementarity. In natural science, objects have neither the ability to reflect and interpret their situation nor to act accordingly. Hence, scientific synergetics is primarily concerned with the relationship between a self-organizing system and its environment. This is fundamentally different when dealing with humans. Therefore, the question always arises whether it is about environmental conditions, as described by observers (or scientists, therapists), or about those conditions as experienced by the clients themselves. This question of perspective was already discussed by biosemiotics a century ago and, in relation to the world of animals, led to the distinction between environment and Umwelt. For the human realm, however, the term \\"Lebenswelt\\" (lifeworld) is preferred to Umwelt.Husserl, Edmund (1936/1970). Die Krisis der europ√§ischen Wissenschaften und die transzendentale Ph√§nomenologie (The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology). Hamburg: Meiner. Lebenswelt is characterized above all by an inexhaustible supply of intersubjectively agreed symbols, which makes the human being an \\"animal symbolicum\\".Cassirer, Ernst (1953‚Äì57). Philosophy of symbolic forms. 3 vol. English translation. New Haven: Yale University Press (Original German title: Philosophie der symbolischen Formen, 1923‚Äì29). The different perspectives explain why objective findings of diagnostics often have little to do with the subject's sensitivities. This also applies to the objectively determined (or officially prescribed) requirements of a person as opposed to what someone feels that it is needed. Both perspectives are important for understanding and cannot be played off against each other. Kriz criticizes that many concepts such as \\"stress\\" or \\"resources\\" are often described primarily on the basis of \\"objective\\" factors such as noise or money, while actually other aspects like lack of appreciation may be relevant to the subject's experience and actions.

Edited by J√ºrgen Kriz, ISSN: 2626-0441. Works and philosophy Kriz has written more than 300 scientific publications including over 20 monographies. His work focuses on statistics and research methodology with particular emphasis on criticism of science as well as the development of a comprehensive approach called person-centered systems theory. Critique of research practice and science Having published several textbooks on statistics, data processing, research methods, and philosophy of science, Kriz focused on the limits of the meaningfulness and application of the corresponding formal models in research and working practice. In comprehensive works such as Methodenkritik empirischer Sozialforschung (critique of social research methods,1981) and Facts and Artefacts in Social Science (1988), he argued that invalid or even nonsensical research findings are not so much the result of incorrect calculations or insufficient execution of the formal steps. Rather, they are due to an insufficient consideration of the model assumptions and boundary conditions. In many contributions, Kriz specifically addressed the issues of an inadequate application of the experimental paradigm in psychotherapy research and an inadequate interpretation of the randomized controlled trial (RCT research). Kriz argues that psychotherapy research usually neither does justice to the fact of non-linear courses in development and change processes nor does it take the human being as subject into account. The conditions for research would not only be determined by manualizedIn psychotherapy, manualization describes the definition and formalization of therapeutical interventions and steps in a procedural instructional book. effects or interventions, but also to a large extent by the patients' subjective attributions of meaning as well as their interpretations. This, however, makes the so-called \\"independent variables\\" of an experimental design dependent on interpretations. The basic concept of an experiment and the RCT logic thus becomes inadequate. In addition to this fundamental misalignment of RCT research in psychotherapy, Kriz has criticized numerous other problems due to questionable ‚Äì mostly undiscussed ‚Äì assumptions.  Person-centered systems theory Courses of human development and changes through therapy, counseling or coaching are characterized by non-linear processes in which many aspects interact. Kriz tried to take this into account when he developed the person- centered systems theory. It deals with non-linear interactions on (at least) four levels: In addition to the interaction of (1) psychological and (2) interpersonal processes ‚Äì which are reflected in most approaches to psychotherapy or counseling ‚Äì the impact of (3) somatic (and here especially evolutionary) as well as (4) cultural processes are considered. Furthermore, the complementarity between \\"objective\\" perspectives of scientists, counselors, etc. on one hand and the perspectives of clients on the other plays an important role in Kriz' approach. Kriz points out that, for example, the \\"objective\\" findings of diagnostics often have little to do with the sensitivities of the subjects. Many concepts such as \\"stress\\" or \\"resources\\" are often described on the basis of \\"objective\\" factors although other aspects are much more relevant to the subject's experience and actions. Subjekt und Lebenswelt (subject and lifeworld, 2017), in which Kriz summarizes three decades of work on person-centered systems theory, provides an essential analysis of the interaction between the four process levels and the complementarity of \\"objective\\" and subjective perspectives. Kriz demonstrates that the distinction between \\"objective\\" description ‚Äì from the 3rd person perspective ‚Äì and subjective experience ‚Äì from the 1st person perspective ‚Äì is a purely academic-analytical concept that contributes little to the understanding of human reality. On the contrary, both perspectives are inseparably intertwined. For in order to be able to understand the very own \\"inner\\" impulses (of the organism), one must apply the cultural tools (particularly the language) of one's own social community to oneself. One must, for example, understand and thus symbolize the immediate physical sensation of physiological processes as \\"longing\\" or \\"sadness\\" or \\"despair\\". This is not just a matter of terminology or semantics and syntax of language. Rather, language also automatically conveys the metaphors, principles of explanation and understanding, narratives, concepts of action, etc. of a culture. Formally, person-centered systems theory is based on the self- organization paradigm within the framework of the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems ‚Äì synergetics in particular. After more formal works such as Chaos und Struktur (chaos and structure, 1992) or Systemtheorie f√ºr Psychotherapeuten, Psychologen und Mediziner (systems theory for psychotherapists, psychologists and physicians, 1999), Kriz has in recent years mostly refrained from explicit formal derivations of the fundamentals in order to address a larger circle of readers.

It is located 24 miles northwest of the Placencia peninsula. History The village was formed as a result of the combined efforts of the people who lived in what was called ‚ÄúOld Santa Cruz‚Äú, Banana farm workers and Fisherman of the area. ‚ÄúOld Santa Cruz‚Äù was made up of a few houses situated about 2 miles north of the Placencia junction on the Southern Highway, it was demolished for the extension of a banana plantation in the year 2005 by a local developer. What is now Santa Cruz Village, was first settled by various ethnic groups which includes Mestizo, Maya, and Belizean Creole. The origin of the name dates back to the beginning of this New century at the time the village was established. Many residents of Santa Cruz Village commute for work daily to the nearby Banana Farms (Belize‚Äôs productive agricultural heartland), Shrimp Farm Factory and also to the popular \\"The Placencia Peninsula‚Äù as it is home to significant tourist destination. Most Santa Cruz‚Äôs Residents speak Spanish and English very well. Etymology Santa Cruz (Santacruz) is originally a Spanish term meaning ‚ÄúHoly Cross‚Äù and referring to the cross on which Jesus was crucified. The name was first used by Levi Flores, one of the first settlers of this village, to identify this place and thereafter villagers followed by making it the official name of this village. Geography A ten-minute drive from Santa Cruz Village lies the Maya King Waterfalls, bounded by the Maya Mountains to the west and The Caribbean Sea to the east. The Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary is a notable nature reserve within the range. It is also bordered by Santa Rosa Village to the south and Riversdale to the southeast. During dusk or on a day that is not overcast, Belize‚Äôs highest peak, Victoria Peak, can be seen from Santa Cruz over the Maya Mountains in the horizon. The most prominent river within the skirts of Santa Cruz Village is the South Stann Creek River, which drains from the Maya Mountains and flows to the Caribbean Sea.

Natural occurrence and derivatives Pseudoisoeugenol naturally occurs in the essential oils of roots from plants within the genus Pimpinella. In addition to its standard form, the compound also occurs in a variety of structural derivatives. Common derivatives include the compound with its side chain bearing an epoxide functional group and the aromatic ring being associated with one of many possible esters in the 2nd position. Common esters include angelic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, tiglic acid, and 2-methylpropionic acid esters. Hydrolysis of these esters, either in-vivo or by using strong acids, forms 2-methyl-5-methoxybenzofuran. Biosynthesis Biosynthesis of the compound is hypothesized to proceed via a NIH shift of anethole.

He served as Secretary of Information and Cultural Affairs under President William Tubman, and as Minister of State for Presidential Affairs under President William Tolbert. In 1979 he was elected National Chairman of the True Whig Party. Following the 1980 Liberian coup d'√©tat of President Tolbert on April 12, 1980, he and several other members of the Tolbert administration were put on trial and without due process executed by firing squad on April 22, 1980.The E. Reginald Townsend and Evelyn Diggs Townsend Papers. Bloomington, IN: Liberian Collections, Indiana University Libraries, 2008. Early life and education Edison Reginald ‚ÄúReggie‚Äù Townsend was born in Schieffelin, Marshall Territory, Liberia; the fifth of seven children to Edward and Annie Townsend n√©e Walker. His grandparents immigrated to Liberia from the United States and from Barbados in the 1800s. Townsend's early education began at Lott Carey Mission in Brewerville, Liberia, then at Liberia College High School. He earned the opportunity to travel to the United States to continue his studies; first at the American University in Washington, D.C. from 1950-1952, and then at Michigan State College in East Lansing, Michigan where he received an M.A. in Journalism. After completing his studies and returning to Liberia, Townsend began working as a journalist, and in 1954 was selected to be Press Secretary to President William Tubman. Civil servant and statesman As Press Secretary, Townsend prepared speeches for the president, oversaw and edited presidential papers for publishing, and accompanied the president on state visits. He realized the need for a public medium, and suggested to President Tubman the need to develop and improve information services in the country. President Tubman supported this endeavor and subsequently appointed him Chief of the Information Bureau at the Department of State (1955 ‚Äì 1958). During his services at the Information Bureau, Townsend implemented an effective medium to keep the people of Liberia informed about their government and its affairs, and domestic and international news at home and abroad. He went on to become Director of the Liberian Information Service (LIS) (1958 ‚Äì 1964), following an act establishing it by the Liberian Legislature. Under Townsend's leadership, Liberia's information services greatly expanded providing print media and on- air radio and television broadcasting, which boosted tourism and appreciation of the Liberian culture. In 1960 the formation of the Liberian Broadcasting Corporation (ELBC) was established, followed by the establishment of television services (ELTV) in 1964. In 1965, President Tubman named him Secretary of the Department of Information and Cultural Affairs, and later elevated the position to cabinet level. In 1963, along with Deputy for Cultural Affairs, Bai T. Moore, Townsend led the founding of the National Cultural Center with the strong backing of President Tubman. Moore and Townsend worked steadfastly together with the many tribal liaisons throughout the country to develop Liberia's National Cultural Center at Kendejah, Marshall Territory. President Tubman opened the Center in 1964, which was described as a ‚Äúpanorama of tribal life, customs and traditions with thirty- one tribal huts and palava kitchens, designed and built by master builders from Liberia's 16 major tribes.‚Äù The goal of the Center was to project the cultural image of the country, encourage and improve indigenous arts and crafts, provide a base for the National Cultural Troupe, and preserve the country's traditional art forms. Following the coup d'√©tat in 1980, the operations and activities of the Center were not maintained, and as a result of the civil wars in the early 1990s the facilities suffered damage and fell into disrepair. Many of its occupants became dislocated and fled. The facilities were subsequently removed and the land converted to commercial use and today is occupied by the Robert L. Johnson Kendeja Resort and Villas. Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs, and Tourism When William R. Tolbert was elected President of Liberia, he appointed Townsend Minister of State for Presidential Affairs (1972 ‚Äì 1979). In this role, Townsend directed and oversaw the office of the president, assisted in the administration and affairs of the cabinet, ensured the goals and agenda set forth by the president and cabinet progressed and were achieved, oversaw the development of presidential speeches, and acted on behalf of the president in his absence. Townsend along with then Foreign Minister Cecil Dennis helped lead the planning, coordination, and support for the Government of Liberia's hosting of the 32nd Summit of the Organization of African Unity in 1979. In April 1979, Townsend was voted in as the 16th National Chairman of the True Whig Party of Liberia, the ruling party of the era. His selection came amidst a time when the party was struggling to transition from one that had a history of dominance by Americo-Liberians to one that needed to broaden its membership base to be inclusive of all members of Liberian society, including indigenous tribes. Known for his uncanny ability to bridge differences between various parties, Townsend won overwhelming approval to lead the party into this next phase. President Tolbert lauded his selection as he too had a partner to help with his ‚Äúmats to mattresses‚Äù and signature ‚ÄúRally Time‚Äù movement to raise the living standards of all Liberians. Other involvement Townsend was an active member of the Presbyterian Church of Liberia, and was ordained Moderator of the Presbytery of Liberia in November 1977. He was the first layperson ever to have been elevated to Moderator since the founding of the church in Liberia in 1833. Townsend was also a freemason and an active member of the Grand Lodge of the Masonic Order of Liberia. In late 1979 he was selected as the Thirty-Second Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Masons 33. Coup d‚Äôetat and death On April 12, 1980, President Tolbert was overthrown and executed by militants headed by master sergeant Samuel Doe and some enlisted men of the Liberian Army. Townsend and nearly all of Tolbert's cabinet ministers and some members of the True Whig Party were charged with ‚Äúhigh treason, rampant corruption, misuse of public office and gross violation of the civil and human rights of the Liberian people.‚ÄùLiberian Soldiers Taunt, Shoot 13 Former Leaders: Leon Dash, The Washington Post (April 23, 1980).Global News Monitor, April 15 ‚Äì 30, 2005 ‚Äì Liberia.

Without due legal process they were found guilty and summarily sentenced to death and executed by firing squad at Barclay Beach in Monrovia on April 22, 1980, ten days after the overthrow of Tolbert. Besides Townsend, the following government officials were executed: Frank E. Tolbert, brother of President William Tolbert and President Pro-Temp of the Liberian Senate; Cecil Dennis, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Cyril Bright, former Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs; Chief Justice James A. A. Pierre; Richard A. Henries, Speaker of the House of Representatives; Frank J. Stewart, Sr, Director of the Budget; John W. Sherman, Assistant Minister of Commerce and Trade; P.

It is the highest point in the Blue Range. Mount Byng's nearest higher peak is Mount Alcantara, to the west-southwest. The mighty Mount Assiniboine is situated to the northwest of Byng. History Mount Byng was named in 1918 for Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, a British Field Marshal who served during the First World War where he commanded the Canadian Corps, and later served as Governor General of Canada. The mountain's name was made official in 1928 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent was made in 1934 by H.S. Crosby, with guide Rudolph Aemmer. Geology Mount Byng is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods and was later pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Byng is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 C. In terms of favorable weather, June through September are the best months to climb.

Razadarit's reaffirmation of Piya Yaza Dewi as the chief queen in 1390 contributed to Queen Tala Mi Daw's subsequent suicide. Brief According to the Razadarit Ayedawbon chronicle, the future queen was a commoner named Mwei Maneit (·Äô·ÄΩ·Ä±·Ä∑ ·Äô·Äî·Ä≠·Äê·Ä∫; \\"Miss Ruby\\").(Pan Hla 2005: 103, footnote 3): Mwei Maneit is a Mon language name, which translates to Me Padamya in Burmese (·Äô·Äö·Ä∫ ·Äï·Äê·Äπ·Äê·Äô·Äº·Ä¨·Ä∏, \\"Miss Ruby\\"). She was a flower seller (or cooking oil seller).(Pan Hla 2005: 103, footnote 3): Flower seller per Razadarit Ayedawbon but cooking oil seller per the Pak Lat Chronicles. She was married to Ma Chut Sut (also known as Ma Aung Sut).Pan Hla 2005: 103‚Äì104 One morning in May/June 1383,(Pan Hla 2005: 94): Razadarit left the capital Pegu (Bago) for Dagon to raise a rebellion on Tuesday, 3rd waxing of Nayon 745 ME (Monday, 4 May 1383). He met Mwei Maneit not too long after he got to Dagon. Prince Binnya Nwe who had started a rebellion against his father King Binnya U saw her at the outskirts of Dagon. The prince was taken by Mwei Maneit's beauty, and took her. Her husband fled to Pegu, and reported the news to Princess Maha Dewi, the prince's aunt and adoptive mother.Pan Hla 2005: 104 It was not just the husband that reacted to the news badly. At Pegu, Prince Binnya Nwe's first wife, Tala Mi Daw, who had just given birth to their first child Bawlawkyantaw, was deeply hurt. At any rate, Maneit became a wife of the rebel prince in exile. About seven months later, she became the chief queen of the Kingdom of Hanthawaddy. On 2 January 1384, King Binnya U died. Two days later, the court accepted the rebel son Binnya Nwe, who had returned to Pegu, as king. The commoner was not Razadarit's first choice to be the chief queen. Nwe called for Tala Mi Daw, who was also his half-sister and of royal birth, but she refused to see him.Pan Hla 2005: 160 In response, Nwe held the coronation ceremony the next day, 5 January 1384,The chronicle Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005: 158) says she became queen on Tuesday, 1st waxing of Tabodwe 745 ME, which translates to Thursday, 24 December 1383. But 1st waxing is a typographical error. Per the Burmese language version of the chronicle (Pan Hla 2005: 356, footnote 1) Razadarit became king on Monday, 12th waxing of Tabodwe 745 ME (Monday, 4 Jan 1384). It means she became queen on Tuesday, 13th waxing of Tabodwe 745 ME (5 Jan 1384). with Maneit as his chief queen. He took the title \\"Razadarit\\", and gave Maneit the title \\"Piya Yaza Dewi\\".Pan Hla 2005: 158 The young king's relationship with his first wife never recovered, and Piya Yaza Dewi remained the chief queen. Her position was once again reaffirmed in 1390. That year, Razadarit held another, grander, coronation ceremony to commemorate his success in reunifying three Mon-speaking regions. He had Piya Yaza Dewi by his side as the chief queen at the ceremony. Tala Mi daw was again deeply hurt. The arguments between them escalated. The king now took away Tala Mi Daw's family heirlooms‚Äîa dozen rings given by their father King Binnya U‚Äîand gave them to Piya Yaza Dewi.Pan Hla 2005: 193 Bitter and heartbroken, Tala Mi Daw committed suicide.Harvey 1925: 114 Razadarit then ordered their only child Bawlawkyantaw to be executed because he suspected that the young son would later avenge for his mother.Pan Hla 2005: 195‚Äì196 According to legend, Bawlawkyantaw before his death swore to be reborn as a prince of Ava, and reincarnated as Prince Minye Kyawswa of Ava, who later became Razadarit's nemesis.Harvey 1925: 114‚Äì115Htin Aung 1967: 90‚Äì91 Piya Yaza Dewi herself died April 1392 (or 1393).The Razadarit Ayedawbon chronicle suggests that she died April 1393 (Kason, 755 ME). But that date is in conflict with the reporting by the standard royal chronicles. The Razadarit (Pan Hla 2005: 203) states that the queen died after Ava troops retreated from the Tharrawaddy frontier, and that Razadarit raised Mwei Ohn-Naung as the chief queen in the month of Kason of that year, without explicitly identifying the year. The prior year mentioned in the chronicle was on (Pan Hla 2005: 197), which says that Ava troops came down to retake Gu-Htut in 754 ME (29 March 1392 to 28 March 1393), and after a dry season campaign, the troops retreated from Tharrawaddy. The narrative (Pan Hla 2005: 197‚Äì203) suggests by the time the queen died, the year had already turned (since he raised the next queen in the month of Kason.) But the dateline of the narrative is inconsistent with that of the standard chronicles. According to (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 301‚Äì303) and (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 429‚Äì432), Ava troops marched south to retake Gu Htut in 752 ME (1390/91), and went to Tharrawaddy in the dry season of 753 ME (1391/92), and left the frontier in or before 754 ME. According to the standard chronicles, in the dry season of 754 ME (1392‚Äì93), Ava was at war with Mohnyin in the north, and not in the south. It means, if Queen Piya did die after the Ava troops had just left as Razadarit suggests, she likely died a year earlier, in or before Kason 754 ME (23 March 1392 to 21 April 1392). Chronicles do not report any children by her. She was succeeded by Mwei Ohn-Naung as chief queen.Pan Hla 2005: 203 Notes References Bibliography Chief queens consort of Hanthawaddy 1392 deaths ","title":"Piya Yaza Dewi"},{"id":"52888592","text":"Robert Gray, also known as Bobby Gray (18 June 1927 ‚Äì 25 October 2018) was a Scottish professional footballer who played for Wishaw Juniors and Lincoln City as a winger.

It is operated by the Yangon Region Transport Authority (YRTA).  History  Prior to the implementation of the new bus network, Yangon's bus network was overseen by the Yangon Motor Vehicles Supervisory Committee (colloquially referred to as Ma Hta Tha), and served a majority of the city's 2.8 million commuters daily. Private bus companies also ran lines throughout the city at a smaller scale. Of the 7,800 buses registered in Yangon, 4,000 of them plied the streets of Yangon daily, covering over three hundred bus lines. The main reason for the overhaul of the bus network was the increasing number of complaints against bus operators for compromising passengers' safety in a bid to maximise profits, with bus drivers driving dangerously to pick up more commuters than their competition. The bus conductors (locally known as 'spares') were also heavily criticised for their poor attitude and constant overcharging. The Chief Minister of Yangon, U Phyo Min Thein brought the issue of public transport reforms into the spotlight.  Implementation  Prior to the citywide overhaul of the bus network, small-scale reforms had already been made to improve the city's bus network. This included the implementation of Yangon's first bus rapid transit system, the Yangon BRT, in February 2016 operated by Yangon Bus Public Company Limited. Despite the BRT system serving only two lines, it has seen considerable success, gaining popularity among commuters for operating an all air-conditioned fleet of buses, as well as introducing the first e-payment system for buses in Myanmar. The new bus network has reduced the old network's 300 lines to 100. YBS will be installing the Yangon Payment Service card system in 4,000 buses in 2019. Asia Starmar Transport Intelligence Co., won the tender to install the card payment system.  Criticism  Yangon Bus Service amid criticism of being ill-equipped to serve commuters, shortage of buses, misconduct of bus staff and constant violation of traffic rules. On 7 April 2017, lawmakers from Yangon Region Parliament called for a transparent review of the YBS.

He is credited with creating several supporting characters and villains in DC Comics' line of Batman comic books. Career Donald Clough Cameron graduated from St. John's Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin and became a crime reporter for the Detroit Free Press in 1924 and later worked for the Windsor Star in Windsor, Ontario. In the 1930s, he settled in New York City and became a writer, publishing short stories, sometimes signed with the pseudonym C.A.M. Donne, for pulps and comic books.

Due to government restrictions on the freedom of speech included in the Espionage Act of 1917 the painting was not displayed until 1968. It is in the collection of the Milwaukee Art Museum. Background In 1918, O'Keeffe was in a state of depression and anxiety about the war and did not paint for three months. While she understood why it was important militarily, she, like many Americans who initially opposed U.S. involvement in World War I, found it at odds with humanism and basic Christian beliefs. O'Keeffe's brother, Alexius or Alexis, was stationed in a military camp in Texas before he shipped out for Europe during World War I. She visited him in the fall of 1917 before he was shipped overseas, and was anxious about his fate. He was one of the first soldiers sent to France and did not believe that he would return to the United States alive. In France war had become very dangerous due to chemical and technologically advanced weapons. Poisonous gases were used against troops, which could kill, blind, or severely injure them. High-powered and long-range guns could cause significant destruction. Submarines planted mines in the seas and airplanes dropped weapons from the sky. O‚ÄôKeeffe found herself at odds with people in Canyon about the war and was discouraged by attempts to glorify it. She tried to persuade her male students to continue their education, rather than fight in the war and she also wanted authorities to create a course for young men about the reasons and causes of war before they engaged in battle. She created a stir when she asked a shop owner to remove Christmas cards from his shop that expressed anti-German sentiment. O'Keeffe became quite ill from influenza during the 1918 flu pandemic, which had killed an estimated 20 million people worldwide, and took a leave of absence from her teaching position at the West Texas State Normal College in early 1918 to recuperate at a friend's ranch in San Antonio, where she painted The Flag. Overview The Flag, both a political statement and a reflection of her fears, is a red streak \\"bleeding into bruise-colored clouds\\". In December 1917, she wrote that she felt compelled for the first time to paint from a sense of necessity. Her image for the painting was of a flag floating in the wind, similar to a tremble. Author Roxana Barry Robinson states, \\"O'Keeffe sets a drooping flag against a starless, darkening sky. The flag flutters limply, stripped of its stars and stripes; its only color, and that of the pole, is blood red.\\" Alexis was severely gassed in France and eventually died from the effects on January 7, 1930, in Cook, Illinois. Anti-war sentiment was criminalized with the Espionage Act of 1917, and people living in Canyon were uneasy due to her anti-war position. The Flag was in the private collection of Mrs. Harry Lynde Bradley in October 25, 1968, when it was part of a Milwaukee Art Museum exhibition, and was acquired by the museum in 1977. The painting was included in the \\"World War I and American Art\\" exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in January 2017 and was later displayed at the New-York Historical Society.

Mission Through its activities, CEFS aims at ensuring and/or supporting: sustainable sugar production for EU operators, growers, employees, and consumers; the proper functioning of the EU single market; and a level playing field on the world stage. CEFS works inter alia to: * Facilitate the joint analysis and resolution of problems relating to market management, nutrition, environment and sustainability, and trade. * Carry out studies relating to agricultural and technological problems connected with the sugar industry. * Organise meetings of a scientific and/or technical nature. * Collect, to this effect, information of a statistical or documentary nature. * Ensure the representation of members towards the European and international institutions. Organisation The CEFS secretariat provides its members with all relevant information on the development of European legislation. It promotes dialogue, participates in scientific research, carries out economic studies, and arranges for the adoption of common positions whenever necessary. The secretariat seeks to ensure that the unanimous positions of CEFS‚Äô members are taken into account by the European and international institutions. The supreme decision-making body of CEFS is its general assembly, composed of all CEFS members. There it holds the statutory elections, adopts the budgets, and determines major policy guidelines. The board of directors, elected by the general assembly, manages all the dossiers dealt with by the committees and working groups, with the guidance of the secretariat. The president of the CEFS, elected for a renewable term of office of three years, is the prime mover. He is assisted in his work by a \\"high-level group of advisers\\", the presidium, whose members are also elected for three years, and by the CEFS secretariat. Eight working groups operate under the supervision of two committees, each chaired by a member of the presidium. The working groups deal with the technical aspects of all dossiers affecting the sugar industry. The committees prepare positions to be submitted to the board of directors and call in external experts to enlighten the debates as required. Members Industrial manufacturers of white sugar from EU Member States and from Switzerland may apply for membership as full members of CEFS. National organisations representing industrial manufacturers from EU Member States and from Switzerland may apply for membership of CEFS as representative members playing a purely advisory role. Raw sugar manufacturers in the French Overseas Departments and European raw sugar refiners, or their representative organisations, may apply for membership as associate members of CEFS. They participate in the work of CEFS in a purely advisory capacity.

The winner of Kazakh wrestling earns greater respect from the people. For example, Kazhymykan Munaitpasov was a well-known Kazakh wrestler who made it on the world sports' fame list for his achievements. History: The earliest rock paintings of Kazakh wrestling can be traced back to 1200 to 600 BC. Kazakh wrestling was a central part of military training in an age in which battles were fought on chariots. A soldier had to possess excellent balance while standing on a chariot and fighting using spear and bow. Another point was that a soldier had to be skillful using both the right and left hand as an opponent could be on his right or left while driving a chariot. The purpose of wrestling seemed to be threefold.https://e-history.kz/en/publications/view/656 1\\\\. to train the soldier in balance while handling the chariot. 2\\\\. the wrestling matches were closely related to religion and served ritualistic purposes. 3\\\\. to train the soldiers in close combat, allowing him to knock or throw his opponent off balance while at the same time maintaining his own. When people began to wear heavier armor wrestling became even more important as sword fights could quickly turn into grappling situations. Techniques: Designed for close combat the techniques were aimed at knocking an opponent off balance from a standing position. This allowed a soldier to use fighting techniques in a real battle at close proximity, when he had a weapon in his hands. The Techniques and methods used in Kazakh wrestling have strong similarities with the ones found in Judo and Mongolian wrestling. Victory is achieved when the opponent is thrown flat on the back. Points can also be achieved by throwing the opponent on the side or forcing him to a knee. The goal of Kazakh wrestling is to throw the opponent on the floor while remaining standing or falling atop of him. As a result of this sacrifice throws and throws that cause the thrower to drop to one or two knees are not favored. The wrestlers are not allowed to touch the legs but can freely grab the jacket and the belt of the opponent. Etiquete: Before the match the wrestler places the hand on his/her chest and bows. The wrestler then greets the opponent with a hug before stepping backwards after which the referee gives the signal for the match. The first competition by Kazakh wrestling was held in village sports festival in 1938. After that the competitions are traditionally held in the cities of the republic. The first international tournament was held in 1952 among Asian participants. When Kazakhstan gained its independence, popularity of Kazakh wrestling extremely increased. Since 1991, the national championships and the leagues are being held every year. Kazakhs organized International Kazakh Wrestling Federation (IKWF) in World Congress in Berlin in 2004. Serik Tukiev became the first federation president. The first Asian Championship by Kazakh wrestling was held in Altaisky Krai, Russia in 2005. There was a big international tournament named after Kazakhstan's president in November, 2005. More than 100 athletes from 25 countries participated there. Among them were Germany, Turkey, the Netherlands, France and others. Mongolia held II Asian Championship in July, 2011. Kazakh wrestling championship was held in August 2011. This game intensify the human body, strengthens muscles, teaches tolerance, bravery, agility, trains to think clearly and find a way out of problematic situations. It is also the national art of self-defense. Wrestlers gain the ability to use all the strength in their body. That means they're allowed to employ all the methods on the belt and above. The point is to throw the opponent with his back down. The wrestlers are divided into 3 groups depending on their age and 8 categories depending on weight. Adults compete for 10 minutes and teenagers for 5 minutes. Kazakh wrestling is included in zonal, regional, republician sports festival programs, teams are honoured throughout the Kazakhstan territory.

In March 1892 Hobbs had designed the plans for the building and was calling for tenders to complete the building works. The old premises for the bank were demolished and construction commenced in April 1892, with the building contract being awarded to J.Hurst and Son at a cost of ¬£5,590. The building was completed and opened in January 1893. In 1927 the Western Australian Bank merged with the Bank of New South Wales, and the building became known as the Bank of New South Wales building. The branch manager, Lionel Wesley Walker, was found shot at South Beach later the same year.

It is situated on the Leipzig‚ÄìHof and the Herlasgr√ºn‚ÄìOelsnitz railways.  History The station was opened on 15 July 1851 along with the Reichenbach‚ÄìPlauen section of the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway. Originally the station had five tracks: the entrance building and goods facilities with freight sheds, loading ramps and loading roads. With the construction of the Voigtland State Railway (Voigtl√§ndische Staatseisenbahn, Herlasgr√ºn‚ÄìCheb) starting in 1863, the station infrastructure was extended by two tracks only, since Herlasgr√ºn would remain a relatively insignificant station. Passenger services towards the Elster Mountains starting or terminating in Reichenbach commenced with the opening of the Herlasgr√ºn‚ÄìCheb (Eger in German) line on 1 November 1865. With the construction of the Plauen‚ÄìOelsnitz connection, which opened in 1874, Herlasgr√ºn station was significantly expanded as the Oelsnitz‚ÄìCheb section was operated in conjunction with the new line. Separate trains were now operated on the Herlasgr√ºn‚ÄìFalkenstein section. In addition to a new entrance building in the \\"wedge\\" between the branching lines, numerous new tracks and a small locomotive depot were built. The old entrance building was used as a residence. In the following decades the station was extended several times, until a larger station upgrade took place in the 1890s. The existing connecting curve between the two railway lines was also established. Up to 1989/90 individual tracks were removed; large-scale dismantling only started at the end of the 1990s. The only new construction was a platform on the connection curve; today only three tracks still operate on the Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway. The station has also lost its former importance as a stop for express trains.  Herlasgr√ºn locomotive depot The Herlasgr√ºn locomotive depot, constructed in 1874, consisted of an 11.6-m turntable, a two-storey roundhouse where locomotives were heated (Heizhaus) and a coal shed. The locomotive depot was disbanded around 1900 with the expansion of the Falkenstein locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk Falkenstein). Most recently, class H III locomotives were stationed here. The locomotive shed was demolished in the 1900s; the turntable remained until the early 1970s.

He sat as a member of the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\") between 1920 and 1924. Life Philipp Fries was born in Roggendorf (Mechernich), then a village in the Eifel hills southwest of Cologne. His father was a railway official. He attended school in Roggendorf between 1888 and 1896 before training as a tailor. He then spent time as an itinerant tradesman. He undertook his military service between 1903 and 1905. Fries joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1900, becoming politically active in the trades union movement and the party from 1907, while continuing to work in tailoring till 1919. In 1910 he became district party chairman in Cologne, becoming in 1914 a member of the Upper Rhine Party Regional Executive (\\"SPD Bezirksvorstand Oberrhein\\"). In October 1919 he became a Cologne city councillor. He undertook his war service between 1914 and 1918 but was able to remain politically engaged. The decision of the party leadership to agree what amounted to a parliamentary truce on the issue of war funding for the duration of the war proved contentious within the SPD from the outset: in June 1915 Philipp Friess was one of seven party activists in Cologne to add their signatures to a letter of protest drafted by Karl Liebknecht and addressed to the Party Executive on the matter. Two years later the SPD finally split apart over the same issue: Fries was a member of the breakaway faction that now became the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). It was as a USPD candidate that in June 1920 he was elected to the newly constituted national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\"), representing Electoral District 23 (Cologne-Aachen). Within the USPD he was a strong advocate both for linking up with the Communist International (Comintern) launched the previous year in Moscow and for a party merger in Germany between the USPD and the newly formed Communist Party of Germany. In October 1920 he took part in the USPD party conference at Halle and then, early in December 1920, in what became the \\"Unification\\" party conference in Berlin at which most (though not all) USPD members switched to what came to be known without irony, at least for a few months, as the United Communist Party of Germany (\\"Vereinigte Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands\\" / VKPD), in which he was in the same month elected to the national control commission (\\"zentrale Revisionskommission\\"). In Cologne he became regional chair for the VKPD. Within the Reichstag he joined with other USPD members and two Communist members, Paul Levi and Clara Zetkin, to form the VKPD faction. Party unity proved elusive, however, and during the first part of 1921, in the wake of the ill-fated \\"March Action\\", Fries was one of those who resigned from the VKPD with Paul Levi and together set up the short-lived Communist Workers' Community (\\"Kommunistische Arbeitsgemeinschaft\\" / KAG). By April 1922 he was back in the SPD. Between 1919 and 1921, and again between 1924 and 1933, Philipp Fries served as a Cologne city councillor. Between 1924 and 1933 he also sat as an SPD member of the Prussian regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\"). By this time Fries had gained a reputation as an effective public speaker, and after 1922 he found himself ferociously and repeatedly attacked by his Communist former comrades as a \\"renegade\\". The political backdrop changed dramatically after January 1933 when he Nazi party took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire at the end of February 1933 was immediately blamed on \\"communists\\", and politicians who were or had been active in communist politics found themselves at the top of the government target list. Philipp Fries was arrested in June 1933 an interned successively in the concentration camps at Esterwegen and Lichtenburg. However, he was released in December 1933. Following the unsuccessful attempt on the leader's life in July 1944 a mass-arrest of non- Nazis took place on the night of 22/23 August 1944. Philipp Fries was arrested and detained for a time, after which, fearing further arrest or worse, he spent the rest of the war in hiding. After the war ended, formally in May 1945, Cologne found itself in the British occupation zone. Amid much uncertainty there was a widespread assumption that the end of the war would mark a return to multi-party democracy, and in the second half of 1945 Philipp Fries was involved in re-establishing the SPD in Cologne where, till 1947, he served as chair of the party for the local sub-region and as a member of the party executive for the Middle Rhein district. Between 2 October 1946 and 19 April 1947 he was a member of the regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\") for the newly defined state of North Rhine-Westphalia. There having not yet been time to organise elections, seats were allocated to the political parties at the direction of the military occupation forces, allocating seats to democratic parties in the proportions defined by the elections of 1932, which were widely considered to be the last free and fair election in Germany. Fries's own tenure was cut short in April 1947 when he retired from politics on grounds of ill-health. He died in Cologne on 7 December 1950.

Echternkamp, and starring Manu Bennett, Marci Miller and Malcolm McDowell. It is a sequel to the 1975 film Death Race 2000. Both films were produced by Roger Corman, who described the film as \\"a car-racing picture with some black humor.\\"  Plot  The year is 2050. In the United Corporations of America, which is plagued by overpopulation and an unemployment rate of 99.993%, the Death Race provides both entertainment and population control. Spanning from Old New York to New Los Angeles, the current Death Race features reigning champion Frankenstein, genetically engineered athlete Jed Perfectus, hip-hop sensation Minerva Jefferson, female cultist Tammy the Terrorist and the evil, black, artificially intelligent, self-driving car ABE. Each driver is assigned a proxy, a broadcaster who allows the audience to experience the race through virtual reality. Frankenstein is immediately put off by his proxy, Annie Sullivan, and ignores both her attempts to interview him and her suggestions to let his opponents pass him. As the drivers race through the East Coast, rebels, led by former network producer Alexis Hamilton, set traps throughout the sector. Tammy and Minerva form a fierce rivalry when they steal each other's cult followers for kills. After running into a rebel trap, ABE malfunctions, kills its proxy, and abandons the race to discover its purpose in life. At the first checkpoint, Hamilton orders Annie, who is revealed to be her spy, to kill Frankenstein. Her attempt to seduce him fails, as he cares for nothing but winning the race. Elsewhere, the Chairman explains that Frankenstein has become a liability due to his longevity, whereas Perfectus will encourage his devoted fans to die at his hands. On day two of the race, the drivers pass through the heartland of the country, known for its gun- wielding citizens. Minerva's proxy, Chi Wapp, is killed by a suicide bomber sent by Tammy. Frankenstein takes a shortcut on another tip, but his car gets stuck in a cornfield. As Annie wanders off, Frankenstein fends off against a group of Resistance ninjas to score more points. Upon reaching the second checkpoint, Annie admits to being a rebel and attempts to recruit Frankenstein. Politically apathetic, Frankenstein curses both the rebels and the government, reiterating that his desire is only to win the race. At a bar, Minerva reveals to Annie that she is an educated intellectual who plays a stereotypical hip-hop character to survive. Coming back to Frankenstein's room, Annie saves his life from Perfectus, who is jealous of Frankenstein's popularity and sex appeal. Meanwhile, it is discovered that Hamilton and the Chairman are working together behind the scenes. On day three of the race, the government sets \\"approved\\" routes for the drivers to avoid Resistance attacks. Annie helps Frankenstein shift gears, due to his right arm being damaged in his fight with Perfectus. Minerva chases Tammy, but she falls off a cliff to avoid Tammy's suicidal proxy. Tammy gloats at Minerva's death before a returning ABE rams her against the wall and self-destructs, destroying them both. Frankenstein and Annie wipe out Hamilton and her rebels, while Perfectus takes a secret route toward the finish line. Both cars jockey for position until Perfectus loses control of his car and crashes into the virtual reality control booth. Before crossing the finish line, Frankenstein broadcasts a message to his fans, suggesting that the Chairman himself is worth 1,000 points. After killing the Chairman, to the delight of the spectators, Frankenstein encourages them to leave their virtual reality behind and start their own Death Race. As the country erupts into violent chaos, Frankenstein and Annie watch from the distance, suggesting that they should repopulate the country after the chaos dies down.

Corman contacted Universal Pictures who had produced the modern remake (which Corman felt had jettisoned too much of the political commentary of the original) and discussed bringing back the dark satire of the original. Corman told them, \\"You did a good job, but you‚Äôve taken out the killing of the pedestrians and the broken-society themes.\\" Filming Filming began when Corman was in his late 80s and during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It features a businessman who is now the Chairman of the United Corporations of America. Corman told an interviewer, ‚ÄúThe president does have a hair style which could be approaching Trump‚Äôs hair style, but I don‚Äôt want to get too heavy into that, because Trump will come and go and the film will remain.\\" Release Critical reception , the film holds an 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on eight reviews with an average rating of 6.8/10. Writing for ComingSoon.net, Chris Alexander called the film \\"loud, shrill, spastic, sadistic, stylish, slipshod, stupid and smart in equal measures.\\" Scott Weinberg, reviewing the film for Nerdist, said \\"all very clunky and ramshackle and kitschy, but that‚Äôs just part of the 'shaggy dog' charm of the production.\\" And Sebastian Zavala, writing for Screenanarchy.com, declared \\"it‚Äôs got enough blood, guts, simplistic political commentary, scenery chewing and terrible special effects for it to become a cult classic.\\" Home video The film was released in the U.S. on DVD and a DVD/Blu-ray combo with three making-of documentaries: The Making of 2050, The Look of 2050, and Cars! Cars! Cars!. It was released in the U.K. on March 20, 2017.

It is the largest public park in Makati with an area of . The park is under the management of the Parks and Green Division of Makati's Department of Environmental Services. It was created in 2001 as part of the Linear Parks Project of the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission. Description Makati Aqua Sports Arena The Makati Park and Garden is located in the villages of West Rembo and Cembo, just east of Guadalupe Nuevo and north of Bonifacio Global City. It is bordered by J.P. Rizal Avenue to the south, the Makati Aqua Sports Arena to the east, and the Rizal Riverwalk and Lawton Avenue to the west. The University of Makati main campus, Fort Bonifacio Elementary and High School, the Ermita de San Nicolas de Tolentino and Makati City Jail are located just across the street from the park. The park is one of 25 Pasig riverside parks in Metro Manila developed by Financial Building Corporation in 2001 under contract from the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission. It is also a bird sanctuary and one of five plant nurseries in Makati. A prominent feature of the park is the monument to Andr√©s Bonifacio located on the western side near the parking area. The monument, designed by Filipino sculptor Juan Sajid Imao, son of National Artist Abdulmari Imao, was erected in 1997 to commemorate Bonifacio's death centennial. The park also features a small lake, fountains, a man-made waterfall, an aviary, amphiteater, pavilion, and gazebos, including a floating octagonal gazebo. The park's Artist Pavilion serves as a function hall and is a favorite venue for social activities and receptions such as wedding and birthdays.

Life Born in Turin, Saletta joined the army at a very young age, joining the Military Academy of Turin in 1856. He fought in the 1860 campaign in the Marche, and then in the Third War of Italian Independence. He was promoted Colonel in 1880.

It was erected on December 13, 2003 in Salsk (Rostov Oblast). It is the first monument to a White movement leader in Russia. The architect is Alexey Begun, and sculptors are Vladimir and Danila Surovtsevs. The monument is made of bronze and granite.  History  In 2001, an initiative group for installation of the monument was formed. After two years of their efforts, town administration decided to build the monument near the site of death of the general. Salsk from 1918 to 1920 was named Markov in honour of him. Support for the project was declared from many Russian officials, including Presidential Administration and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The monument has also received the blessing of Archpriest of Rostov and Novocherkassk Panteleimon. Initially it was planned to erect the monument in the city of Rostov-on-Don, near the building where the headquarters of the Volunteer Army were situated and where generals Lavr Kornilov and Mikhail Alekseev began their famous \\"Ice March\\". However, after a meeting of the interdepartmental commission on the city street names, squares and other places of public interest, as well as after meetings at the Ministry of Culture of the Rostov region, it was decided to erect a monument in the town of Salsk. In the Rostov region there was held a TV poll in order to determine the reaction to the installation of the monument in the region. Most of the respondents reacted positively. The construction works were mostly funded by local citizens. Opening of the monument took place December 13, 2003 and was timed to the 85th anniversary of the death of Sergey Markov. The opening ceremony was attended by Deputy Governor of the Rostov Oblast, Ataman of the Great Don Army V.P. Vodolatsky and other officials.

The frequency of various RRI depend on the type of running, as runners vary significantly in factors such as speed and mileage. RRI can be both acute and chronic. Many of the common injuries that plague runners are chronic, developing over a longer period of time, as opposed to injury caused by sudden trauma, such as strains. These are often the result of overuse. Common overuse injuries include stress fractures, Achilles tendinitis, Iliotibial band syndrome, Patellofemoral pain (runners knee), and plantar fasciitis. Proper running form is important in injury prevention. A major aspect of running form is foot strike pattern. The way in which the foot makes contact with the ground determines how the force of the impact is distributed throughout the body. Different types of modern running shoes are created to manipulate foot strike pattern in an effort to reduce the risk of injury. In recent years, barefoot running has increased in popularity in many western countries, because of claims that it reduces the risk of injury. However, this has not been proven and is still debated.  Overuse injuries   Causes and prevention  Pronation neutral and supination placements of the right ankle. The ankle and foot naturally pronate and supinate by about 5 degrees while walking or running. The red arrows indicate excessive pronation. In general, overuse injuries are the result of repetitive impact between the foot and the ground. With improper running form, the force of the impact can be distributed abnormally throughout the feet and legs. Running form tends to worsen with fatigue. When moving at a constant pace, a symmetrical gait is considered to be normal. Asymmetry is considered to be a risk factor for injury. One study attempted to quantify the change in running form between a rested and fatigued state by measuring asymmetrical running gait in the lower limbs. The results showed that \\"knee internal rotation and knee stiffness became more asymmetrical with fatigue, increasing by 14% and 5.3%, respectively\\". These findings suggest that focusing on proper running form, particularly when fatigued, could reduce the risk of running- related injuries. Running in worn-out shoes may also increase the risk of injury and altering the footwear might be helpful. These injuries can also arise due to a sudden increase in the intensity or amount of exercise.  Achilles tendinitis  Achilles tendinitis is the inflammation of the Achilles tendon, resulting in pain along the back of the leg near the heel. There are two types of Achilles tendinitis, insertional and noninsertional. Noninsertional Achilles tendinitis is the type that more commonly affects runners. In this case, inflammation is occurring in the middle portion of the tendon, whereas insertional Achilles tendinitis is inflammation located where the tendon connects (inserts) to the heel bone. Having tight calf muscles may also increase the risk of Achilles tendinitis. Stretching the calves before starting heavy exercise may help relieve tightness in the muscles.  Patellofemoral pain syndrome  Patellofemoral pain syndrome is associated with pain in the knee and around the patella. It is sometimes referred to as runner's knee, but this term is used for other overuse injuries that involve knee pain as well. It can be caused by a single incident but is often the result of overuse or a sudden increase in physical activity.  Iliotibial band syndrome  Diagram indicating the location of the iliotibial band and pain associated with iliotibial band syndrome Iliotibial band syndrome is defined as inflammation of the iliotibial band on the outside of the knee. This inflammation occurs a result of the iliotibial band and the outside of the knee joint rubbing together. The resulting pain typically is initially mild and worsens if running continues. Recurrence is a common issue with iliotibial band syndrome, as pain goes away with a period of rest, but symptoms can easily come back as the runner returns to training. During recovery, the muscles on the outside of the hip can be stretched to reduce tightness in the band.  Plantar fasciitis  The plantar fascia extends from the heel bone to the distal part of the metatarsophalangeal joints of each toe and divided into three sections. The plantar fascia helps support the arch of the foot. Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain and affects about two million people in the Unites States. Though considered an inflammatory condition, plantar fasciitis is now characterized as a degenerative pathology. Intrinsic risk factors include obesity and limited ankle dorsiflexion. Extrinsic risk factors include deconditioning, hard surfaces, inadequate stretching and poor footwear.  Footwear   Traditional running shoes  So-called 'traditional' running shoes are designed to give more support and cushion the landing to reduce the effects of impact. They allow for more comfortable running on hard surfaces such as asphalt and also protect the foot when stepping on rocks or other potentially sharp objects. However, the cushioning provided in traditional running shoes is thought to encourage a foot strike pattern, where the heel lands first. Heel striking generates a relatively large amount of impact force that can put different parts of the lower extremities under excessive stress.  Barefoot running  Barefoot running has been promoted as one method of reducing the risk of running-related injuries. Barefoot running is thought to improve running form by encouraging forefoot striking. The collision of the forefoot with the ground generates a significantly smaller impact force in comparison to striking heel first. However, barefoot running leaves the foot unprotected from stepping on sharp objects. Although running barefoot may reduce the risk of running-related injuries, it is important to take time while switching from running with shoes. Beginning to run barefoot without reducing intensity or mileage of training can actually cause muscle or tendon injury. Changing one's style of running shoe or switching to barefoot running will most likely alter the foot strike pattern, meaning that the force of impact will be absorbed differently. Injuries are more likely to occur in novice barefoot runners. This may be a result of not yet having fully adapted to a new style of running, and therefore running with inconsistent technique. To measure this, a study was conducted involving runners who habitually run with a rearfoot strike while wearing shoes. Of the runners involved in the study, 32% used a heel strike pattern in initial attempts at running barefoot. Running barefoot while heel striking leads to increased muscle activation and impact accelerations. The findings suggest that an inconsistency in running technique among novice barefoot runners may put them at a higher risk of injury in comparison to running with shoes. Under some hypotheses, humans and their recent evolutionary ancestors may have needed to be able to run long distances in order to survive, and therefore natural selection would have favored traits that improve humans ability to run for long periods of time. = Endurance running hypothesis = According to the endurance running hypothesis, long distance running has been suggested to have played a significant role in the lifestyle and evolution of early hominins. Before developing more advanced hunting tools such as the bow and arrow, are thought to have used endurance running for scavenging and hunting. Persistence hunting is \\"a form of pursuit hunting in which [the hunter uses] endurance running during the midday heat to drive [prey] into hyperthermia and exhaustion so they can easily be killed\\". Unlike many medium-to-large mammals that use panting as a form of evaporative cooling, hominins rely on sweating, allowing evaporation to occur on a much larger surface area. In this way, sweating results in better thermoregulation that allows the hominin to outlast the prey during the chase. This is one potential explanation for the loss of most body hair in humans. Those individuals with less body hair would be able to better thermoregulate while running to avoid overheating. For this species to exist under the endurance running hypothesis, running most likely did not result in the frequency of injuries that it does today, because such an injury to early hominins likely led to starvation. This example would imply that recent ancestors of humans experienced selective pressure to adapt to barefoot running.  Minimalist footwear  Minimalist shoes are an alternative option that can be seen as an intermediate between running barefoot or with traditional running shoes, as they lack the high cushioned heels of traditional running shoes. These shoes are also designed to encourage forefoot striking. One study observed the redistribution of mechanical work with fast speed running in minimalist shoes compared to conventional shoes in 26 trained runners. The results showed that running at a fast pace in minimalist shoes caused a statistically significant redistribution of work from the knee to the ankle joint. Therefore, switching to a minimalist running shoe may be beneficial in preventing recurrence for runners who have experienced a knee injury in the past. However, the switch could also increase the risk of ankle and calf injuries. As with to barefoot running, runners who chose to switch to minimalist shoes should not start out at full training intensity.

It is also used in the treatment of torsades de pointes, severe asthma exacerbations, constipation, and barium poisoning. It is given by injection into a vein or muscle as well as by mouth. As epsom salts, it is also used for mineral baths. Common side effects include low blood pressure, skin flushing, and low blood calcium. Other side effects may include vomiting, muscle weakness, and decreased breathing. While there is evidence that use during pregnancy may harm the baby, the benefits in certain conditions are greater than the risks. Its use during breastfeeding is deemed to be safe. Magnesium sulfate for medical use is the magnesium sulfate heptahydrate salt. The way it works is not fully understood, but is believed to involve depressing the action of neurons. Magnesium sulfate came into medical use at least as early as 1618. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. External uses Bath salts Magnesium sulfate is used in bath salts, especially for foot baths to soothe sore feet. The reason for the inclusion of the salt is partially cosmetic: the increase in ionic strength prevents some of the temporary skin wrinkling (partial maceration) which would occur with plain water baths. Epsom salt baths have been claimed to also soothe and hasten recovery of muscle pain, soreness, or injury. However, these claims have not been scientifically confirmed. The solubility of magnesium sulfate water is inhibited by lipids in lotions resulting in variable absorption rates when applied to the skin. Temperature and concentration are also factors. Isolation tanks Magnesium sulfate is commonly used in flotation therapy to prepare the concentrated solutions that fill the isolation tanks. Its high solubility in water yields baths with high specific gravity that making the body more buoyant. Its negligible toxicity is an important asset in that application. Mineral waters Magnesium and sulfate ions are naturally present in some mineral waters. Drawing paste In the UK, a medication containing magnesium sulfate, called \\"drawing paste\\", is claimed to be useful for small boils or localised infections, and removing splinters. The standard British Pharmacopoeia composition is dried magnesium sulfate 47.76% (by mass), phenol 0.49%, and glycerol to balance. Internal uses Magnesium sulfate intravenous solution Magnesium sulfate can be administered internally by oral, respiratory, or intravenous routes. Magnesium deficiency Magnesium sulfate is used as a replacement therapy for magnesium deficiency Arrhythmia Magnesium sulfate may be used as an antiarrhythmic agent for torsades de pointes in cardiac arrest under the ECC guidelines and for managing quinidine-induced arrhythmias. Asthma Magnesium sulfate may be used as bronchodilator after beta-agonist and anticholinergic agents have been tried, e.g. in severe exacerbations of asthma,. The salt can be administered by nebulization or by intravenous injection. Eclampsia Magnesium sulfate is effective in decreasing the risk that pre-eclampsia progresses to eclampsia. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is used to prevent and treat seizures of eclampsia. It reduces the systolic blood pressure but does not alter the diastolic blood pressure, so the blood perfusion to the fetus is not compromised. It is also commonly used for eclampsia where compared to diazepam or phenytoin it results in better outcomes. Early delivery Magnesium sulfate was once used as a tocolytic, but meta-analyses have failed to support it as an anti-contraction medication. Usage for prolonged periods (more than five to seven days) may result in health problems for the baby. In those at risk of an early delivery, magnesium sulfate appears to decrease the risk of cerebral palsy. It is unclear if it helps those who are born at term. Guidelines for the use of magnesium sulfate in mothers at risk of preterm labour are not strongly adhered to. Lead poisoning Magnesium sulfate was historically used as a treatment for lead poisoning. Prior to the development of chelation therapy, cases of accidental lead ingestion were often immediately treated with magnesium sulfate, which would cause the lead to be precipitated out and, with a high enough dose, literally purged from the digestive system. In this application, magnesium sulfate saw particular use in veterinary medicine of the early-to-mid 20th century; Epsom salt was already available on many farms for agricultural purposes, and it was often prescribed in the treatment of farm animals which inadvertently ingested lead. Research Magnesium sulfate has been used as an experimental treatment of Irukandji syndrome caused by envenomation by certain species of Irukandji jellyfish, but the efficacy of this treatment remains unproven. Safety An abnormally elevated plasma concentration of magnesium is called hypermagnesemia.

It protects a rugged area in the cerrado biome near the state capital of Belo Horizonte. As of 2014 nothing had been done to implement the park, which existed only on paper. Location The Baleia State Park is in the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. It has an area of . The park is in the Taquaril neighborhood of the city. It is at the foot of the Serra do Curral, about from the city center. The area has six springs that supply the population of the Serra neighborhood in Belo Horizonte. History A Botanical Garden was defined in the area by decree 10.232 of 1932 with the objective of preserving the vegetation and landscape of Belo Horizonte. This would be the first conservation unit in the city and one of the first in the state and the country. However, nothing was done to implement it. The Baleia State Park was created by decree 28.162 of 6 July 1988. The park was to be implemented by the city in partnership with the state. As of 2010 it had not been opened to the public. The park adjoins the Mata das Baleias (Baleias Forest), owned by the Hospital da Baleia. In 2010 the Hospital da Baleia said it was partnering with the private sector to support adventure tourism in the forest, and establishing partnerships with universities for research. The Solidarity Trail leads from the hospital's headquarters to the Pico Belo Horizonte, also known as Antenna Peak, from which the whole city is visible. The hospital would gain revenue from tourism. In October 2014 the Public Ministry of Minas Gerais (MPMG) filed an action demanding implementation of the Baleia State Park, naming the State Forestry Institute (IEF) and the Prefecture of Belo Horizonte. The ministry said the area had been protected since 1932 but the park had never existed except on paper. There was no infrastructure, and the park suffered from fires, squatters, deforestation and water pollution. The action required creation of a consultative council for the park and demanded appointment within 30 days of a manager and four park rangers, with vehicles and necessary equipment. Environment The Baleia State Park holds diverse natural environments due to its rugged topography, and its varied rocks and soils. It holds alpine meadows, cerrado and a small area of gallery forest. The park provides a refuge for several endangered species of birds and animals. 188 species of birds have been catalogued, of which 11 are endangered and three are endemic to the Baleia Forest. The three endemic birds species, considered endangered in other regions, are white-rumped tanager (Cypsnagra hirundinacea), blue finch (Porphyrospiza caerulescens) and swallow-tailed cotinga (Phibalura flavirostris). There are small mammals such as possums, armadillos, monkeys, coatis and ferrets.

Her style is a mixture of pop and soul music with jazz and blues accents. She is considered by the press to be the Belgian Adele or Amy Winehouse. Her mother tongue is French. She is also fluent in English, Spanish and Dutch.  Beginnings  She began piano at age five, scales at eight, and wrote one of her first songs at twelve. At fourteen she started taking singing lessons. She learnt live performing in numerous piano bars and met the person who would become her producer and manager, Fran√ßois Leboutte. He had her record her first demos before launching her in the profession. At the end of 2012 she released her first single, Your Turn, which was warmly received by Belgian radio stations and was the most played song in the French speaking part of Belgium in 2013. When the moment came to release her first EP, she lost her voice during a live show, due to a vocal fold cyst. She had to remain silent for several months to avoid the necessity of an operation which might make her lose her voice tone. She had no choice but to cancel all her engagements.  Success  In 2013 she started posting piano-voice covers on YouTube, which quickly achieved millions of views. Her cover of \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" was noticed by the rapper Coolio, its original interpreter, who called it the best cover of his hit. In 2014 she released two EPs. First was Time, which contained original songs and recorded in Paris, London and New York in collaboration with (Tom Coyne, Volodia‚Ä¶). And Visions, a cover EP she offers to her internet followers. Among her most famous tracks are \\"Time\\", \\"To Say Goodbye\\", and \\"No Diggity\\". All of these tracks made the best radio charts and the double EP spent several weeks in the official charts. Thanks to these songs, she was invited to appear on numerous TV shows and to give numerous concerts across Europe and at festivals such as Les Francofolies de Spa, the Brussels Summer Festival and the Festival de Cannes. In 2015 the RTBF music show D6bels on Stage dedicated a special edition to her and the news broadcast of the same channel mentioned her among the favourites of the Francofolies de Spa's 2015 edition. In 2016 she went to London to record her next album in Abbey Road studios, which has preserved the equipment used in the 1960s. She notably worked with Dimitri Tikovo√Ø, Danton Supple and with the funk, jazz, hip-hop and soul collective The Heliocentrics. The Whispers, the first single from these recordings, was released in March 2016. In January 2017 she was nominated for the D6bels Music Awards in the categories \\"Female Artist of the Year\\" and \\"Artist Classic 21\\", and she released a new song, Daddy's Not Coming Back. On 13 October 2019, Typh Barrow was among various artists (including Yannick Noah, Christophe Ma√©, Black M, and James Blunt) to perform at R.T.B.F.'s Cap48 event, (a fundraising event held mainly to help those with disabilities in the Wallonia-Brussels and German communities of Belgium).

The Human Tower Museum of Catalonia (MCC in Catalan) is a museum project that is being built in the city of Valls, capital of the Alt Camp and considered as the birthplace and zero point for human towers. The project is designed as a place of reference for the human tower universe where experiences can be lived out. The initiative is being developed through a Consortium made up of the Catalan Government's Department of Culture, the Tarragona County Council, Valls City Hall and the Coordinator of Catalan Human Tower Groups. The Catalan Government will preside the consortium and Valls City Hall will execute the museum and secretariat works.  From the idea to the project  The proposal to create a museum dedicated to human towers in the city of Valls is strongly linked to the Valls historian and photographer Pere Catal√† Roca. At the end of the 1950s he was already leading a proposal to set up a centre that would spread the human tower culture. Accordingly, exhibitions were held in Valls and in Tarragona, in 1964 and in 1968 respectively, to back up the proposal that Catal√† Roca presented once again during the 1977 Congress of Catalan Culture and in the 1982 Congress on Traditional and Popular Culture. The Human Tower of Museum of Catalonia's first \\"board meeting\\" was held on 26 July 1978 and consisted of a president, Francesc Manresa Bar√≥, and 13 other members: Ramon Trilla Gatell, Joan Cusid√≥ Rodriguez (Colla Vella dels Xiquets de Valls), Joan Enric Rib√© (Colla Joves Xiquets de Valls), Joan Raf√≠ Fontanillas, Josep M¬™ Rod√≥n Barrufet, Jordi Badia Cucurull, Joan Climent Ferr√©, Llu√≠s F√†bregas Pla, Josep Busquets Odena, Josep Casanova Coll, Josep Secall Duch, Pere Catal√† i Roca and Jaume Casanova \\"Crossa\\". The initiative would be taken up by the Valls Institute of Studies, creating a commission in 1984 that would offer continuity to the other actions that the entity had already been carrying out, like the human tower exhibition held in the Old Hospital of Sant Roc in 1981. It moved to the Can Segarra building in 1985, in Pla√ßa del Blat number 9, where a permanent exhibition was set up to coincide with the city's Main Sant Joan Festival. Due to structural defects, the property was forced to close down just two years later. In 1997 a new phase was started in which the drafting of the museum project began. It was drafted by a commission of specialists who were convened by the Catalan Government's Department of Culture, Valls City Hall and the Valls Museum. The intention of locating the Museum in Can Segarra wasn't abandoned until 2003 when the old military barracks were proposed which, till that time, had been occupied by the Narc√≠s Oller Secondary School, located in Pla√ßa del Quarter. In 2007, Valls City Hall once again announced a change of location with the creation of a new building outside the city centre, in the area of Ruanes. In Valls on the Thursday 11 June 2009, the Councillor of Culture and Media, Joan Manuel Tresserras; the Mayor of Valls, Albert Batet; the President of the Tarragona County Council, Josep Poblet; and Miquel Botella, the President of the Coordinator of Catalan Human Tower Groups, presented the Human Tower Museum Project in a press conference with explanations given by the author and prestigious architect, Dani Freixes Melero, from the Varis Arquitectes SLP company. After decades of ideas, this was the first specific architectonic project for the new facility. These specifics were for a building of 3,000m2, which implied a new surrounding estate of 10,000 m2. On Saturday 17 October 2009, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the Xiquets de Valls, the Human Tower Museum project was presented in public before 700 people in the Pati square and with the participation of the four Consortium members. The first executive architectonic project was formalised in 2010. In November of the same year the UNESCO recognised the human towers as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Finally, in 2013, the project is re-dimensioned changing to the Pla√ßa del Blat, the zero point for human towers in the heart of Valls Old Town. This architectonic project still carried the stamps of Dani Freixes and Varis Arquitectes, who relocated the building to the area called Espardenyers, given that the Espardenyers streets cross this medieval area that is located between the arcaded Pla√ßa del Blat and Pla√ßa de l‚ÄôOli. Obtaining the land is carried out by mutual agreement between the INCAS√íL ‚Äìthe Catalan Land Institute, assigned to the Catalan Government- and Valls City Hall. The price is set at 746,721 ‚Ç¨. thumb314x314px Working in M√≥n Casteller - The Human Towers Experience On 22 April 2014, demolition started on the 29 properties that would make way for the space required to build this new cultural and tourist facility. The demolition was done manually given the age of the properties and their dilapidated state. 34 companies tendered for this demolition project and it was finally adjudicated to Excavacions Carbonell. On Friday 27 March 2015, the newly formed piece of land, with 1,559 m2, held the act to start the construction work on M√≥n Casteller ‚Äì The Human Tower Museum of Catalonia. It was a public event with 34 simultaneous pillars made by the human tower groups on the spot where the new building would be erected. Another eleven human tower groups were represented by their presidents. In total, 45 groups participated in the celebration. The Muixeranga d‚ÄôAlgemes√≠, the Moixiganga de Tarragona and the one from Valls also attended as cultural expressions of the origins of human towers. After this first joint pillar and after the enxanetes placed the shield of each group inside an urn representing the first stone, the aerial show company, Sacude, took over by staging a show based on vertical contemporary dance on scaffolding that was 15 metres high, reinterpreting the values of the human towers ‚Äìstrength, balance, courage and good sense‚Äì, linked to tradition and modernism. On Thursday 16 April 2015, the company Carbonell Figueres, which had won the tender in which 35 companies had participated, started the construction work on the new facility. This consisted of constructing the building's shell. The cost is 2,727,331 ‚Ç¨.  The museum  With the opening of M√≥n Casteller. The Human Tower Museum of Catalonia, a museum centre that is unique in the country was set up, entirely and exclusively dedicated to the human tower building's intangible cultural heritage. It has 2,800 m2 of built surface area and 2,446 m2 of usable surface area distributed between the basement, the ground floor, the mezzanine, the first floor and the viewpoint terrace. The building is not a closed space, rather it is connects the two arcaded Pla√ßa del Blat and Pla√ßa de l‚ÄôOli, maintaining their ancestral urban continuity. It also creates a new, circular shaped plaza that opens up in a spectacular way in the medieval section. A pillar of light stands over the building. The chromatic changes of this luminous lighthouse symbolise the different colours of the shirts worn by the human tower groups and the plurality of their heritage. On the ground floor we find the reception area, the shop, the cafeteria and, as the zenith of the visit, the immersive and sensorial area. The mezzanine opens up to the pedagogical area, the archive and the Human Tower Documentation Centre (CEDOCA in Catalan) which safeguards the documentation related to human towers and its own resources. The first floor holds the area for experiences made up of the permanent museum exhibition and there is also a room for temporary exhibitions. The basement is the headquarters of the Coordinator of Catalan Human Tower Groups, while the roof open on to a viewpoint terrace with views of the highest bell tower in Catalonia.  The museum project  The Human Tower Museum of Catalonia project has been elaborated from the museum project that began between 1997 and 2003 and it will be drawn up by a commission convened by the Catalan Government's Department of Culture, Valls City Hall and the Valls Museum. The verdict of the tender for ideas to define the Museum project, in which 18 companies participated, was published on 8 January 2016. The jury, made up of specialists from areas such as tourism, culture, new technologies, architecture and human towers, awarded the project to the museography and scenography company run by Ignasi Cristi√†. The proposal reflects the human tower motto \\"strength, balance, courage and good sense\\" which comes from Josep Anselm Clav√©'s poem \\"Los Xiquets de Valls\\" from 1867. Likewise, under the name of \\"A tower in three acts\\" explores the sensations and emotions that surround the human tower events, using audiovisual and multimedia resources to achieve it. The amount to draft and manage this museum project is 139,460 ‚Ç¨. On entering the Museum, the visitor will encounter a large scale audiovisual in a room that will connect the building's two floors. This first encounter aims to symbolise the courage of the human tower builders as you can experience, at first hand, the vertigo endured by the \\"enxaneta\\", the child who crowns the tower. The second part is dedicated to good sense and balance that represent wisdom, experience and technique. It also presents the progress of this phenomenon in terms of historical consolidation, expansion, technique refinement and the role of the city of Valls as the human tower birthplace. At this point, five circular nodes that symbolise the base formation of the towers take the visitor along the route that includes dynamic and visual panels, creating an organic structure in movement. The last part, dedicated to strength, culminates with a multimedia system that shows the burst of joy, emotion and enthusiasm when the tower is completed, through an immersive and sensorial audiovisual. The production of all the Museum's audiovisual material is undertaken by the company Grup Lavinia, through its company Lavinia Spurna Visual, winner of the public tender. This is based on the use of various audiovisual languages like real images, info-graphic or animated resources. It has the editing and post-production participation of the company called Potato. The undertaking consists of making 6 large audiovisuals and the 2 interactive ones that were considered in the museum project. The cost of the audiovisual production and post-production has been ‚Ç¨428,445. Lavina Spurna Visual has recorded images throughout 2016 of fifteen human tower events, chosen by the \\"Taula de Localitzacions\\", made up of fifteen specialists from the human tower world from various places. The museum project includes a historical area with contents produced by the Scientific Council of The Human Tower Museum of Catalonia, which consists of nine experts in Human Towers who have been named by The Human Tower of Catalonia Museum Consortium. In addition, the \\"Taula L√®xica\\", which is also made up of dozens of specialists, has been given the task of selecting terms included within the human tower lexicon for the museum project.  The Old Town, the Museum's headquarters  The building of the M√≥n Casteller. The Human Tower Museum of Catalonia is one of the actions promoted by Valls City Hall in order to regenerate the city's Old Town. Following the example set by other European cities, the aim is to carry out urban remodelling by creating new places and the enhancement of the urban fabric. Likewise, there will be the installation of new civic and cultural facilities in newly built buildings or reforms will be carried out on existing properties. In Valls, all of this has led to the construction of the Espai Ca Creus, which groups together the services offered by the Civic Centre, the City Hall's Department of Culture, the Valls Jove Youth Service but, overall, the Carles Card√≥ County Library, inaugurated in 2014. Regarding properties, we would highlight the refurbishment of the old Carme convent inaugurated in September 2014. This work meant that the Enxaneta School could return here and the place can now be enjoyed by the whole city, as now both the cloister and the new events room hold a variety of civic and cultural acts. The school's playground also holds the Christmas Park. So, with M√≥n Casteller. The Human Tower Museum of Catalonia, the Valls Old Town development project continues as set out in the Catalan Government's District Law 2/2004 dated 4 June.

It protects a rugged area in the transition zone between cerrado and Atlantic Forest. Springs in the park are important to the water supply of the state capital, Belo Horizonte. Location The Serra do Rola- Mo√ßa State Park is in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, divided between the municipalities of Belo Horizonte, Nova Lima, Ibirit√© and Brumadinho. It has an area of . It contains six important springs that supply water to the city, and this area is closed to the public. History The Serra do Rola-Mo√ßa State Park was created by governor H√©lio Garcia by decree 36.071 of 27 September 1994. The Tabo√£o, Rola-Mo√ßa, Barreirinho, Barreiro, Mutuca and Catarina water basins in the park protect the water sources used by the Minas Gerais Sanitation Company (COPASA/MG). Activities such as leisure and tourism that may interfere with biota in these areas were therefore prohibited, and the areas were administered by COPASA/MG. The State Forestry Institute (IEF) was made responsible for overall administration of the park and for developing plans for administration and environmental education. The consultative council included representatives of government and civil society organizations. Environment The park is in the transition zone between cerrado and Atlantic Forest. It contains areas of Atlantic Forest, cerrado, Alpine tundra and rupestrian ferruginous fields. The ferruginous field vegetation, growing on the iron-bearing \\"canga\\" crust, is extremely rare and is found only in the iron quadrilateral of Minas Gerais and in the Caraj√°s Mountains in the state of Par√°. Visits to these fields are allowed only when accompanied by park monitors. The park has diverse flora with species of the Orchidaceae, Bromeliaceae families and jacaranda, arnica and cedrus genera. Species include Cariniana legalis, Gochnatia polymorpha and Vellozia squamata. The park provides a refuge for endangered fauna such as the cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), Pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) and solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius). Visiting The park is open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm daily. Camping is not allowed. Access to trails, springs, waterfalls and nurseries requires advance scheduling. At the Nova Lima entrance there is a visitor center with an auditorium for 90 people, meeting rooms and rooms for the environmental police. At the Barreiro entrance in Belo Horizonte there is an auditorium for 60 people, offices, employee residences and the base of the environmental police. The park has hiking trails and lookouts. The Tr√™s Pedras, Planeta, Jatob√° and Morro dos Veados lookouts provide panoramic views. The best time to visit is between April and October, when there is less rain.

Originally a rectangular building measuring 18 feet by 24 feet, it has been expanded over the years and now covers 40 feet, 10 inches by 32 feet, 6 inches, the shorter side being the front of the cabin. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1992. History The cabin exists in a rural area off of Forest Road (FR) 245, just to the west of its intersection with Arizona State Route 373. In 1911, the U.S. Forest Service declared the area which includes the property where Butterfly Lodge sits as a protected area. As part of a program which encouraged U.S. citizens to develop public lands, a long- term lease was issued to Schultz by the local forest ranger. Schultz financial success as a writer and explorer enabled him to build the first cabin by a non-resident in the remote White Mountains. Two men from nearby Greer, Arizona, John T. Butler and Cleve Wiltbank, built the cabin in 1913, intending to be used by James Willard Schultz as a hunting lodge and retreat. The men used ponderosa pine and Douglas fir to build the cabin. Schultz son, Hart Merriam Schultz (also known as Lone Wolf), later put additions on the structure, including an artist's studio. The site was a clearing near a spring, purported to be the headwaters of the Little Colorado River. The plethora of butterflies in the area was the impetus for the name of the cabin. Between 1916 and 1929 three additions were made to the structure, including a bedroom and storage area, an artist's studio, and a kitchen. The exterior of the cabin has also undergone changes over the years. Initially, there was no front porch, the main entry was reached by two wooden steps. There was very minimal trim as well after its construction, and very early on there was an Indian geometric design painted on the front door, as well as the phrase \\"Apuni Oyis 1914\\" painted on the front fascia. Apuni Oyis is Blackfoot for \\"Butterfly Lodge\\". Above the apex of the front door there was an antlered deer skull mounted. The two wooden steps were replaced by a wooden porch, followed by a stone porch, with a wooden railing supported by concrete and rock tapered pylons. The modest trim was replaced very early on, with wider, more ornate trim, which exists to this day. By the end of the 1930s the deer skull was removed, and the skull of steer was placed above the windows. The natural logs lost their bark, and eventually the structure was painted brown, with the trim originally painted green, which was changed to brown later on. Currently, the railing on the porch is in a state of disrepair, as is the concrete surface of the porch. From its initial construction through the 1920s, the house was used by Schultz primarily as a retreat and a base for hunting. However, it is likely that he did some of his writing on the premises. In the 1930s Schultz transferred ownership to his son, Lone Wolf. It was Lone Wolf's primary residence from the 1920s through the 1960s. While he did maintain a residence in Tucson, and a temporary summer shelter in Montana, the cabin near Greer was his base. The long-term lease originally given to Schultz in the 1910s expired with the death of Lone Wolf in 1970, and the property, along with the cabin, reverted to the National Forest Service. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Forest Service used the cabin to house men and equipment. In 1990 the supervisor of the Apache National Forest applied for inclusion the National Register of Historic Places. The organization, James Willard Schultz-Lone Wolf Museum, obtained the cabin and the two acres surrounding it from the Forest Service, and established the Butterfly Lodge Museum. Structure Floor plan of the Butterfly Lodge The cabin consists of 5 and half rooms, of logs with plank and slab construction. Originally it covered 18 feet by 24 feet, but has been expanded with three additions during the 1920s and 1930s, and now covers 40 feet, 10 inches by 32 feet, 6 inches, the shorter side being the front of the cabin, which lies to the southwest of the building. There was a fireplace on the east end of the structure. The logs were hewn on three sides, leaving the bark on the fourth side to serve as exterior facing, as well as their corners having a double saddle notch in the corners of the building. The logs were procured from the Isaacson Saw Mill, which was located not far away on Benny Creek. View to the Northeast The first addition was made to the west corner in 1914, consisting of a shed-roof room, running the entire length of the cabin, and increasing the width of the cabin by 13 feet, nine inches. This addition most likely served as a bedroom and storage area. At some point during the 1920s, another room was added to the cabin, this time to east corner of the structure. However, this room did not run the full length, and thus created an \\"L\\" shape to the building, and was intended as an artist's studio. The final addition to the structure was made in 1929, in the north corner, which returned the structure to a rectangular shape. It was used as the kitchen. The front door is located on the southwest well of the building, and is of vertical tongue and groove construction, measuring six feet, two inches tall by two feet, ten inches wide. To the west of the door are four horizontal two-over-three sash windows, each window measuring eight inches tall by ten inches wide. The gable has enclosed eaves and reaches eleven feet in height. The first addition increased the length of this side of the structure by almost fourteen feet, and includes two casement windows with two- over-two sash on this side of the building. Each of the windows is ten inches tall by eight inches wide. The northwest side can be broken down into three sections, each corresponding to the interior room it encloses. All the sections are plank construction with slab exterior. Each of the three sections contains a window. The first window looks into the bedroom and a double hung two-over-two sash measuring ten inches high by eight inches wide. The second window looks into the bathroom, and is identical to the bedroom window. The third window, looking into the kitchen, is a two-over-two casement measuring ten inches high by fourteen inches wide. The rear of the cabin faces northeast and contains a door and two sets of windows. Nearest the northwest corner are two windows of horizontal two-over-two sash construction, each measuring ten inches high by sixteen inches wide. Next to the windows are the door which leads into the kitchen, being 6 feet, 2 inches high by 2 feet, ten inches wide; like the front door it is also tongue and groove construction, although at a 45 degree angle. A wooden porch with three steps leads up to the door, and measures four feet, six inches wide. On the other side of the door are a sequence of five windows looking into the art studio. Each window is ten inches high by eight inches wide, and are horizontal three-over-three sash. The southeast side of the structure has door entering the art studio. There are three horizontal three-over-three sash windows which look into the original room of the cabin. In popular culture The cabin served as the backdrop for Schultz's 1920 story, In the Great Apache Forest; The Story of a Lone Boy Scout, about a local brother and sister, the teenagers George and Hannah Crosby. The book gained international fame, especially in Europe. The poet Henry Herbert Knibbs wrote a poem entitled \\"Apuni Oyis\\", which was included in his book, Riders of the Stars: A Book of Western Verse. The poem is a tribute to James Willard Schultz, and starts off, \\"There's a lodge in Arizona where the rugged pines are marching / Straight and stalwart up the hillside till they gather on the crest, / And around their feet the grasses and the purple flowers are arching / In the dim and golden glamour of the sunlight in the West.\\" See also National Register of Historic Places listings in Apache County, Arizona References National Register of Historic Places in Apache County, Arizona Apache County, Arizona ","title":"Butterfly Lodge"},{"id":"52890481","text":"West Pit is a 4.3 hectare Local Nature Reserve in Cherry Hinton, on the south- eastern outskirts of Cambridge.

The distillery was named after a local river, the White Horse. The river itself is said to be so named due to the colour of the water that ran in the river as a result of the operations of a distillery in the centre of the town. Now long gone, according to local folklore, the distillery or the brand were sold to Scottish distillers in the 1800s. If true, this would mark an interesting change of fortunes in the distilling industries of the two countries, as similarly a named, more enduring White Horse whiskey brand was established in Scotland in 1861.  History  The history of the distillery is somewhat difficult to trace, however, it is known that two distilleries were in operation in Mouthrath around 1801. One of which had only recently been established by a John Carr. Carr offered the \\"large and extensive distillery\\" together with about 50 acres of land for lease in 1794, remarking that the tenant could be \\"accommodated with all necessary utensils - 1,000 gallons still, worm, boiler etc. all new and in working order\\". However, Carr does not seem to have found a long-term tenant, as in 1797, a subsequent advert appeared in a Dublin newspaper under his name requesting the services of a distiller. Carr's distillery does not seem to have been a very successful venture; suffering a fire in 1805, and having 12,000 gallons of whiskey stock seized and sold for non-seizure of duties the following year, it eventually fell bankrupt in 1811, with Carr emigrating to Canada. An 1838 report on excise duties paid on spirits produced Ireland, shows no duties were paid in Mountrath in 1836, suggesting that both distilleries had either closed or ceased operations at the time. Likewise, an 1846 directory of businesses in Ireland, which including a detailed entry on Mountrath, gives no mention of a distillery operating in Mountrath at the time.

Background The Centenary Commemorative Medal was awarded to all Permanent and Reserve personnel of the Defence Forces in December 2016 in acknowledgement for the ceremonial role played by √ìglaigh na h√âireann across all aspects of the centenary commemorations programme. The medal is based on the 1916 Medal which was awarded to those who rendered recognised military service during the week of 23 April 1916. The project to deliver a National Flag to all primary schools in the Republic of Ireland was conducted between September 2015 and March 2016 and involved 10,000 Defence Forces personnel visiting 3,200 schools and presenting them with a handmade National Flag and a copy of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. The Easter Rising centenary parade at the General Post Office, Dublin (GPO) included 2,800 members of the Defence Forces and a display of military equipment, vehicles and aircraft watched by over 750,000 people lining the streets of Dublin. Also as part of the 2016 State Centenary Programme, the Defence Forces raised the National Flag on O'Connell Street every day in 2016. 13 parades were held to award the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal to all members of the Defence Forces. The first medals were presented by President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins and members of the government at a state ceremony in Dublin Castle on 4 December 2016, as part of the Centenary programme. This was followed by 12 regional events at selected military installations nationwide presided over by Minister Paul Kehoe. Medal Design The medal is a dark bronze alloy 35 mm in diameter, fashioned (after the manner of the official Defence Forces crest) in the form of a circle of flame representing the sunburst on which eight points of a star are superimposed.

William Greatbatch (Circa 1735 to circa 29 April 1813) was a noted potter at Fenton, Staffordshire, from the mid-eighteenth to the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. Fenton was one of the six towns of the Staffordshire Potteries, which were joined in the early 20th century to become the city of Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. Cream jug modelled and made by Greatbach, c. 1765 North Staffordshire became a centre of ceramic production in the early 17th century, due to the local availability of clay, salt, lead and coal. The nature and scale of local pottery production changed dramatically during the course of the 18th century as part of the Industrial Revolution. Greatbatch served as an apprentice to Thomas Whieldon at Fenton Vivian before setting up as an independent manufacturer. He developed and supplied wares to Josiah Wedgwood during a business partnership lasting some twenty years and later, following a bankruptcy, worked directly for Wedgwood at the Etruria works until his retirement. Greatbatch was especially important as a designer and modeller of complicated patterns for tableware shapes, designing and making the moulds for Wedgwood and other potteries. A typical William Greatbatch teapot, depicting 'The Fortune Teller'. Creamware with overglaze printed and painted decoration. c. 1778‚Äì1782.  Personal life and antecedents  Aurora teapot, 1760s, hand-painted overglaze enamels over transfer-printed black. The exact date and place of William Greatbatch's birth have not been established. It is thought that he was born around 1735 and the surname Greatbatch suggests a local Staffordshire origin for the family. Writing in 1829, Simeon Shaw stated that Greatbatch's father was a farmer at Berryhill who supplied coals to the pottery manufacturers of the area, including Thomas Whieldon, but modern scholars have considered this to be unsupported by evidence. On 26 March 1759 Greatbatch married Sarah Simpkin and they had three sons, Hugh, William and Richard. The two eldest sons went on the work in the pottery business.  Career as a potter  William Greatbatch was apprenticed to Thomas Whieldon at Fenton Vivian, possibly in 1753. Whieldon was one of the most prolific and influential potters of the day and Greatbatch's apprenticeship would have offered many opportunities. Greatbatch was a highly skilled and innovative modeller and followed in the footsteps of Aaron Wood, one of the greatest Staffordshire modellers who had left Whieldon's employment a few years previously.Dolan, Brian (2004) Josiah Wedgwood: Entrepreneur to the Enlightenment. London: HarperCollins. P. 63. Greatbatch first met Josiah Wedgwood when apprenticed to Whieldon, during a time when Whieldon and Wedgwood were in business partnership (1754 to 1759).Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 50 William Greatbatch left Whieldon's employment sometime before 1762 and possibly as early as 1760.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 39 He was confident enough in his mid-twenties to set up an independent business at Lower Lane, Fenton. Here, he enjoyed a business arrangement with Josiah Wedgwood from at least 1762, supplying Wedgwood with a wide range of pottery wares as well as block moulds. William Greatbatch was a skilled modeller, designer and maker of block moulds for the more elaborate types of ware which needed to be press-moulded or slip-cast.Barker, David (1991).

As well as working for Wedgwood, Greatbatch also designed, manufactured and sold wares in his own right for the following twenty years.  Bankruptcy  The London Gazette dated 12th to 16 February 1782 carried a notice of William Greatbatch's bankruptcy, the reasons for which are not known.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 58https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/12270/data.pdf refer to p. 7 of 8, column 2 It is unclear what happened immediately following his vacation of the Lower Lane site by 1783, however, by 1786 he is recorded as being in the direct employment of Josiah Wedgwood at the Etruria works, holding an unspecified senior position. It is possible he was taken on as general manager when Wedgwood's cousin Thomas Wedgwood left around the same time (1788) intending to establish his own works (though Thomas died shortly afterwards).Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 64 On his bankruptcy the pottery works were taken over by the landlord, William Baker of Fenton House, who established his own pottery on the site.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 58  Retirement and death  Greatbatch continued in this position until his retirement around the year 1807, aged about 72, when his work notes cease. He enjoyed an unusually generous pension thereafter, on the instructions of Wedgwood who had pre-deceased him in 1795, as well as the rent-free use of a substantial house owned by Wedgwood, in recognition of his high regard.

H4 The exact date of death was not recorded but burial records show he was interred on 29 April 1813 in the churchyard of St. Peter ad Vincula in the parish of Stoke upon Trent.  The wares  Greatbatch is best known as a producer of creamware, and finished wares were either finished with transparent glaze or were hand painted or, after 1770, had transfer-printed decoration applied under the glaze. Creamwares included the tortoiseshell wares, and a variety of moulded and colour-glazed wares such as the cauliflower wares. Pearlware was also produced from around 1775. This is closely related to creamware (but not used synonymously by experts). Pearlware uses a china glaze which is a lead glaze with a blue tint resulting from the addition of a minute quantity of cobalt to the recipe.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 167 Often the same designs were used in production of both creamware and pearlware. Wares could also be decoratively turned by lathe, or rouletted for effect; sponged or painted with colour either under- glaze or over-glaze or slip decorated (at this period this would mean marbled). Applied relief decoration was also common at least until around 1770.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 187 Greatbatch produced a wide range of domestic wares, including teapots, coffee pots, cups and saucers, bowls, dishes and plates amongst others. The invoices for supply of wares to Wedgwood suggest there were probably at least 60 different models in production at any one time, though the type of ware (e.g., creamware or red stoneware) is not specified on these lists.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 88 Greatbatch was an expert modeller and maker of block moulds for the production of wares and often produced these for Wedgwood and others.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 96 Certain types of pottery were popular and produced by many manufacturers of the time, and were commonly traded amongst each other for business reasons, so it is not always possible to say which manufacturer made any particular piece. Minute examination of form in remaining sherds found on site ‚Äì whether handles, spouts or decorations ‚Äì have allowed some unique Greatbatch features to be recorded (see Typology (Archaeology)). Of all the types produced, the moulded creamware Fruit Basket Ware type has now been shown to be uniquely the work of Greatbatch.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P. 241 This fine type included tea and coffee wares, canisters, cups, jugs and plates, each with a distinctive design of a band of woven basketwork, above which is a trellis band with fruit of various sorts piled into the basket.  Tortoiseshell wares and Thomas Whieldon  Tortoiseshell wares are those that have been decorated by the application of coloured metallic oxides prepared as slips and applied to the biscuit body of a pot either by sponge or by brush. These were then covered by a transparent lead-glaze and fired a second time (known as glaze or glost firing). Historically, tortoiseshell wares have come to be associated almost exclusively with Thomas Whieldon, however, in his 1991 study, Staffordshire ceramics expert David Barker states: ‚ÄúMany of the wares manufactured by Whieldon are of types now known to have been made by Greatbatch and have been found on the Greatbatch site. Whieldon ware, or Whieldon-type ware are terms which are widely accepted in describing a variety of ceramics, particularly tortoiseshell wares, but which lead to problems in any objective research into the pottery of the period.‚ÄùBarker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P.82 Examples of mid-18th century Staffordshire earthenware with glazes stained by underglaze pigments. Victoria & Albert Museum, London, Room 138 The Fenton site, described below, contained many examples of tortoiseshell wares from the Greatbatch factory from throughout the 1770s.  Archaeology  The discovery, early in 1978, of a quantity of 18th century factory waste material in Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, unexpectedly brought the name of William Greatbatch to the attention of ceramics students.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter. London: Jonathan Horne. P.67 The significance was first recognised by ceramics expert Donald Towner and the site was then excavated by David Barker on behalf of the City Museum & Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent. An exceptionally large waste tip was uncovered containing layers of pottery showing the various types of wares produced by the Greatbatch works over a period of twenty years from 1762 to 1782.Barker, David (1991). Beneath the Six Towns: The Archaeology of the Staffordshire Potteries. City Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent. . The site of Greatbatch's factory was some 100 metres away. This was close to the works owned by Thomas Whieldon with whom Greatbatch served his apprenticeship, at Fenton Vivian. Thanks to these excavations, Greatbatch's products have become the best documented of all the wares of the period.Barker, David (1991). William Greatbatch: A Staffordshire Potter.

Expanded craters have lost their rims, this may be because any rim that was once present has collapsed into the crater during expansion or, lost its ice, if composed of ice. Excess ice (ice in addition to what is in the pores of the ground) is widespread throughout the Martian mid-latitudes, especially in Arcadia Planitia. In this region, are many expanded secondary craters that probably form from impacts that destabilize a subsurface layer of excess ice, which subsequently sublimates. With sublimation the ice changes directly from a solid to gaseous form. In the impact, the excess ice is broken up, resulting in an increase in surface area. Ice will sublimate much more if there is more surface area. After the ice disappears into the atmosphere, dry soil material will collapse and cause the crater diameter to become larger.Viola, D., et al. 2014. EXPANDED CRATERS IN ARCADIA PLANITIA: EVIDENCE FOR >20 MYR OLD SUBSURFACE ICE. Eighth International Conference on Mars (2014). 1022pdf. Since this region still has abundant expanded craters, the area between the expanded craters would have abundant ice under the surface. If all the ice was gone, all the expanded craters would also be gone. Expanded craters are more frequent in the inner layer of a type of crater called double-layer ejecta craters (formerly called Rampart craters).Barlow, N., Boyce, J., Costard, F., Craddock, R., Garvin, J., Sakimoto, S., Kuzmin, R., Roddy, D., Soderblom, L. 2000.

Research, published in 2015, mapped expanded craters in Arcadia Planitia, found in the northern mid latitudes, and the research team concluded that the ice may be tens of millions of years old. The age was determined from the age of four primary craters that produced the secondary craters that later expanded when ice sublimated. The craters were Steinheim, Gan, Domoni, and an unnamed crater with a diameter of 6 km.Viola, D., et al. 2014. EXPANDED CRATERS IN ARCADIA PLANITIA: EVIDENCE FOR >20 MYR OLD SUBSURFACE ICE.

Later she won as a candidate of Bhartiya Janta Party in the 2007 and 2012 Uttarakhand assembly election. She never lost any election in her career. In 2017 assembly elections barthwal was denied party ticket and BJP decided to field Ritu Khanduri daughter of former uttarakhand chief minister instead of her against huge public outrage.

Barthwal filed the nomination to fight as an independent candidate but later withdrew her nomination supporting her party's decision.  Chairperson State Women Commission  On 22 December 2018, Senior BJP leader Vijay Barthwal has been made the chairperson of Uttarakhand State Women's commission. Barthwal was expected to be accommodated since she was denied the Assembly ticket from Yamkeshwar Assembly segment in 2017 despite being a sitting MLA.

However, the main Opposition Congress and BSP members abstained on the occasion. Leaders of both the parties said they decided not to field any candidates against Barthwal as they do not have enough number in the house to win the election. They also criticised the ruling BJP for not following the healthy traditions of a parliamentary democracy and said that the post of deputy speaker goes to the Opposition by convention.

The band was formed in 2012 by guitarist Christoffer Oster and vocalists Henrik Dahlqvist and Glenn Zettersten. They released two studio albums, Still Waters Run Deep in 2013 and Weltschmerz in 2015, combining raw ferocity with dark atmospheres. Totem Skin disbanded in January 2017; what was to be their third album has been reworked into the self-titled debut album of Oster's new project D√∂dsrit.  History  Totem Skin was formed in 2012 by guitarist Christoffer Oster, who wrote some songs and was joined by vocalists Henrik Dahlqvist and Glenn Zettersten for their recording. The band's name is based on a lyric from the song \\"Tauntrum\\" from Document No. 12 by Pg. 99. They abandoned their original intention to exist as a studio band, asking guitarist Jesper Sundstr√∂m and drummer Sebastian Engstr√∂m to perform live with them in the winter of 2012/2013 while recording their second EP. By March, the band transformed into a sextet with the addition of bassist Jonas Axelsson. At this point, they had already self-released two EPs, both mixed and mastered by Alexander Backlund: Totem Skin on 21 August 2012 and These Ghosts Are Haunting Our Halls on 18 March 2013. This was followed in 2014 by a split EP with Swedish band Heart on My Sleeve. The band's debut studio album Still Waters Run Deep, which was mixed, mastered and engineered by Lewis Johns with assistant engineer Tony James and recorded at the Ranch Production House on the outskirts of Southampton, England, came out in 29 October 2013 through Dog Knights Productions, Protagonist Music and Middleman Records. It was the first set of songs that they had written \\"together as a whole group with the intent of performing them live\\" and with \\"a more or less running theme in the lyrics as well as the music\\". The album's artwork was made by Adrian B. of Coven Illustracion; it depicts a skogsr√•, reflecting the album's lyrical focus on the power of nature and its relation to society. The final song, \\"Seasons Don't Fear the Reaper, We Can Be Like They Are\\", which was re-recorded from their first EP, features a sample from Silent Hill 2. Totem Skin's sophomore album Weltschmerz was released in 12 October 2015, on vinyl through Halo of Flies Records and Protagonist Music in the United States and Adagio830 in Europe, on CD through Tokyo Jupiter Records, and on tape through Wolves of Hades. It was engineered by Johns with assistant engineer Chris Lyndon and recorded at the Ranch Production House in March 2015, while the artwork was made by Chris Panatier. In 2016, Zettersten, Sundstr√∂m and Engstr√∂m formed the crust punk project Vardagshat. On 26 January 2017, the band announced that they were breaking up, and that what was supposed to be their third studio album will be recorded under a different project. On 6 June, they announced that the new band and album will be named D√∂dsrit. The album was released on 13 October 2017 through Alerta Antifascista Records.  Style  On their Bandcamp, Totem Skin placed their work mostly within the categories of punk, atmospheric, blast beat, d-beat, hardcore, screamo, metal, sludge and tremolo, and less frequently grind, blackened and emo. Their style had been described in reviews of their sophomore album Weltschmerz. Comparing them to KEN mode, Echoes and Dust praised the way the album blends brutal grindcore with \\"occasional ambient touches\\" and high-fidelity production. Rock n Roll Reviews likened the band to Converge, writing that they managed to infuse \\"extreme metal into hardcore\\" through the \\"combination of punk ideals with the atmospherics of black metal and the slow crunching riffs of doom\\" in an original way. According to Metal Trenches, \\"Totem Skin delivers a mix of crust and hardcore with a few post-metal touches\\". Rushonrock stated that they inhabit \\"the same scorched musical landscape as Nails and Trap Them ... [and] while their style has plenty in common with the contemporary US crust scene, they mosh to their own tune ... [at times conjuring] an icy atmosphere, giving the album a sense of foreboding and even nodding to fellow Swedes Cult of Luna.\\" Reviewing their debut album Still Waters Run Deep, Already Heard also compared them to Converge. Terrorizer wrote that Still Waters Run Deep \\"[weaves] intricate and sombre melodies in amongst ... apocalyptic displays of aggression\\", and called Totem Skin a \\"dark hardcore\\" band. When asked about their combination of ominous atmosphere and dire vocals, likened to Circle Takes the Square's As the Roots Undo, in a 2013 interview with Idioteq, Totem Skin replied that they were inspired by their environment, particularly Sweden's nature. They stated that their lyrics are mostly written by vocalists Henrik Dahlqvist and Glenn Zettersten, with some by guitarist Christoffer Oster, who comes up with most initial ideas for songs. When asked whether they feel to be a part of a contemporary movement of bands such as Nails, This Gift Is a Curse, Oathbreaker and Deafheaven blending post-hardcore and post-metal with black metal, they said that although some of them like these bands, different members of the band have different tastes and overall they would simply call themselves a hardcore band. In another slightly later interview they repeated the last point, saying that if they had to apply a label to themselves, it would be \\"K√§ng-emo\\".

In 2014, she was a recipient of the Theodor K√∂rner Prize for music composition. She lives in Vienna. Early life and education Kepl was born in Linz (Austria) and studied music at Anton Bruckner University, earning both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree. During her time at the university, she was a member of the Bruckner Orchestra (the resident orchestra for the Brucknerhaus), and was a composer and performer at Linz's regional theater, the Landestheater. Kepl also wrote soundtrack music for the short films Die Wirtin (2002) and Die Stimme (2005). In 2011, she was awarded a European Union Scholarship from the Donne in Musica program, which led to study in Italy. That same year, Kepl composed and performed the music for the animated film Mein Gr√ºn ist vielleicht Dein Blau. The film also has the English title Chinese Whispers. During her college years, Kepl became a founding member of the Linz-based Balkan band Jazzwa. The band recorded a studio album (No 1) in 2005 and a live album (Jazzwa Live) in 2010. The live album was recorded at the Landestheater on June 9, 2010. Career During the festivities of Linz being the European Capital of Culture in 2009 (called Linz09), Kepl played a multitude of music premieres, firstly as a member of \\"Ensemble09\\" (an ensemble specifically built for this occasion ) at Linzfest '09 with the project Facetten, through a five date concert series as a member of the \\"Traweeg Ensemble\\" performing the project Sonus Loci by as well as playing at Klangspuren Schwaz and Festival 4020 Linz with the project Zum Fleisch composed by Klaus Lang. Kepl began to achieve national recognition in 2012 when she won second place in Klagenfurt's Gustav Mahler Prize. She was subsequently featured on Jazznacht, a music program on √ñsterreich 1, the cultural channel for the Austrian public service broadcaster √ñsterreichischer Rundfunk. The host of the show was Christian Bakonyi. And in 2014, Kepl was awarded the Theodor K√∂rner Prize for music composition. 2012 was the same year that Kepl formed a jazz/groove string quartet, Violet Spin, and performed with them and Indonesian jazz pianist at the 2012 Jazz Fest Wien. In 2014, the quartet was invited to perform at the 12 Points jazz festival (held that year in Ume√•, Sweden). It also appeared on the √ñsterreichischer Rundfunk-sponsored Treffpunkt Neue Musik (New Music Venue), in performance at the broadcaster's Landesstudio Ober√∂sterreich. Violet Spin worked again with Dharmawan at the 2015 Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival. Also in 2015, Kepl was commissioned to compose the piece Chromaloge for string quartet by which was premiered by Violet Spin. Page 17 In March 2018 Violet Spin released their first album spin published by Swiss label spin (2018) Unit Records UTR 4829 with a concert (including a live streaming) at the historic venue of . 14 of the 15 tracks are composed by Kepl while the 15th track red & blue is credited to Violet Spin. Another of Kepl's performing groups, the ensemble Verso, had its first concert appearance in 2012 when she was commissioned to compose a work for the New Adits Festival in Klagenfurt. The work, entitled Get Weaving!, was later recorded at a concert in 2013 and released in 2016 by the American online label Zeromoon.The recording was released as Zeromoon ZERO173. A limited-distribution promotional CD titled Commissioned Work for \\"New Adits - Festival fur Gegenwartige Musik\\" identifies the date and venue of the recording as April 15, 2013 at the Porgy and Bess Jazz Music Club in Vienna. Ensemble Verso was also featured at the Brucknerhaus's International Brucknerfest in 2015, performing another of Kepl's compositions (Brain). Amongst other topics covered in the interview, Kepl discusses her then-recent three-week residency at the Omi International Arts Center in New York and her reasons for forming Ensemble Verso. For the former, also see Kepl returned to the recording studio in 2014, this time in collaboration with American drummer Mark Holub. The album, Taschendrache, was recorded in Vienna and released in 2015 by the British label Slam Productions.Taschendrache (2015) Slam Productions SLAMCD298. This was followed in 2016 by Resonators, an album in which Kepl joined two other musicians in recording free-form works in various resonant stone buildings in the Czech Republic. It was released in 2016 by Another Timbre (a British label). Kepl composed two of the four pieces that appear on that album. The catalog number for the release was Another Timbre at104. The two pieces written by Kepl were \\"Soma\\" and \\"Pirol\\". 2016 also saw the release of Vergeben und Vergessen, a short film for which Kepl provided the music. Aside from Violet Spin's 2015 performance in Jakarta, Kepl's first recognition outside of Europe came in 2017 when she was booked for an eleven-date tour of Australia and New Zealand. The tour coincided with the release of Kepl's first complete solo album, SololoS. It was recorded in a suburb of Paris in 2016 for the French label Fou Records.SololoS (2017) Fou Records FR-CD 20. In October 2017, the label SoundOut Recordings released her solo performance made during this tour at the SoundOut festival in Canberra as the album 'Superstring Theory [Calabi- Yau]'.Superstring Theory [Calabi-Yau] (2017) SoundOut Recordings SO005. Critical reception Writing about the Taschendrache album for Jazzwise magazine, Daniel Spicer found that Kepl's work seemed \\"more intent on establishing mood than making clear melodic statements\\". Regarding the interplay between Kepl and Holub, Spicer found it \\"convincing and compelling, with a genuine sense of dialogue\\". In his review of SololoS, jazz critic Dave Foxall noted the album's various moods, starting with an \\"uneasy sawing of the strings\\", followed by \\"slower, steadier exploration\\" and \\"overwhelming zeal\\". He summarized his impression of the album as \\"50+ minutes of pure sonic brio\\". Foxall is a frequent contributor to Jazz Journal magazine. Bob Rush of Cadence (magazine) thinks about Violet Spins' spin that \\"it is very enjoyable and probably even more so if viewed/heard live\\" Daniel Barbiero from Avant Music News detects on the album that Violet Spin \\"tends to favor the sound of solo voice soaring over a support of pulsing ostinato, chordal vamps or walking lines\\" and that they \\"deliver a precise sound when called for, but they can also reach beyond those constraints into the looser language of creative extemporising\\", while Michael Ternai of MICA Austria writes: \\"Skilfully and passionately making room for their musical and stylistically diversified originality - that‚Äôs exactly what Viennese string quartet Violet Spin is doing on their debut album ‚Äòspin‚Äô.‚Äù Awards * Gustav Mahler Prize (2012) ‚Äì Second-place prize for her composition \\"Rise\\" * Theodor K√∂rner Prize for music and composition (2014) General references * The entry at this database provides lists of compositions, general biographic detail, and other information.

This strike represented the first time a trade union in Sierra Leone was effective in politically organizing with a set organizational structure. It is also the first strike and act of political disobedience in which the Creole elite identified with and supported the strikers and the working class against the British colonizing power.  Historical background  The financial situation in Sierra Leone in the mid-1920s following World War I was not dire. While the deficit for 1921 reached ¬£343,171, by 1923, it was at a surplus of ¬£116,926. The high unemployment rate after the war had gradually been reduced, but the wage rates of the majority of government artisan workers, throughout this improving economic situation, had remained stagnant. In 1919, this engendered a railway strike, where the railway workers tried to build alliances with other government workers and persuaded 2,000 workers of the police force to join them in a strike for higher wages. In order to make the railway more financially profitable, railway rates were increased in 1919 and subsequent years, which did not yield greater profits and raised food prices and those of goods transported via the railway. Thus, the working class conditions, which included the majority of the railway workers, did not improve. In another attempt at improving the financial efficiency of the railway in Sierra Leone, Colonel Hammond, a railway expert, was invited to inspect the Sierra Leone Railway in 1922 and 1924. Following Hammond's second visit, Governor Alexander Ransford Slater, approved a proposal by the general manager, G.R. Webb, imposing an efficiency bar examination for African clerks trying to qualify for salary increases. The attempt to introduce the examination was met by protest on the side of the clerks, who criticized the European staff being exempt from the examination and the failure to give Africans generally permanent appointments. This attempt at introducing a discriminatory policy by the government helped to unify middle class, white- collar Creole clerks, who might otherwise not have been such strong voices in the union, and more manual daily-wage laborers in their discontent and subsequent activism in the railway union. Artisans and clerks, part of the Railway Skilled Artisan Union, had regularly sent petitions to the railway administration. In March 1925, for example, they petitioned the general manager to introduce a grading system, in order to create more jobs and generate greater efficiency. The petitioners were met with contempt and discouragement by the administration, which promptly dismissed key workers for their \\"inefficiency.\\" In April 1925, this finally led to the Railway Workers Union being formed \\"for the improvement of the conditions of all members of the Railway Department.\\" Its members spanned clerks, artisans, and others who joined and adopted the principle of collective responsibility. It was this union, the aligning of clerks and daily-paid workers, who otherwise would advocate separately for their interests, which channeled and articulated the grievances of its members. On January 12, 1926, at a meeting between the chief mechanical engineer, Malthus, and the president of the Railway Workers Union, the administration insisted on the efficiency bar exams and failed to address the workers' requests outlined in their petitions, which finally resulted in A.E. Richards, the workers' leader, verbally notifying the administration of the workers' intention to strike.  The strike   Union background and workers' involvement  On January 14, 1926, the strike officially began and the government, adopting a staunch resistance policy, placed Freetown under police and military surveillance, prohibiting te sale of intoxicating liquors for specific periods, etc. In the days that followed, starting on January 17, strikers were arrested for acts of violence and other perceived misconducts and on January 18 the railway management began dismissing many strikers from their posts. During the strike, the strikers employed different methods of revolt that included removing the rails in front of the general manager's train, removing the rails on curves or steep banks and at the approach to a bridge, pulling down telegraph poles and cutting wires, inhibiting telegraphic communication with the protectorate and other ways of showing their discontent. Nonetheless, applications to fill the posts of strikers who had been dismissed were opened, dismissals which contributed to a surplus of the already abundantly available labor force in Sierra Leone. Despite government claims about the damage incurred by the railway due to the strike, thirteen telegraphists from the Gold Coast, who arrived on January 20, helped maintain communication between Freetown and the rest of the colony, and volunteers maintained goods trains functioning. Governor Slater perceived the strike as a challenge to and revolt against colonial (civil) authority. On January 21, the Executive Council set the terms, which the strikers would have to abide by to return to the railway service: # Daily wage workers would receive reduced pay and be expected to work extra hours to compensate for the strike. Those dismissed would not be re-employed. # Pensionable staff would also receive reduced pay‚Äîtheir grades and increments were reduced on being accepted‚Äîand they would still be required to take the efficiency bar examinations # All returnees would be expected to work additional hours to make up for the strike. The terms set forth by the Executive Council were communicated to the general manager on January 26, and conveyed to the workers in a meeting on January 27. The government insisted on the terms set out by the Executive Council on January 21, until the end of the strikes.  Involvement of the colonized elite  In 1926, in contradistinction to the strike in 1919, the Creole intelligentsia, the majority of the municipality, openly supported the workers. This may also have been because, relevant to the dynamics of Anglo- Creole relations, the atmosphere was very racially charged during the time of the 1926 strikes, which underscored the racial division between the African workers and their mostly white industrial employers, more so than in 1919. At the turn of the century, thinly-veiled racialism evoked by the application of Darwin's evolutionary theory to scientifically establish the superiority of the white races, had solidified racial authority and given rise to particular dynamics between the colonizers and the colonized elite, where the colonizing Europeans did not disguise their contempt for the abilities of educated, though racially \\"inferior\\" Africans. After World War I, this yielded an increasing number of racially motivated instances of physical violence against Creole citizens which were seemingly condoned by the government; for example, the 1926 case of Barber, an African customs officer who was assaulted by an assistant district commissioner, A.H. Stocks, for alleged insolence (an incident also known as the Stocks affair). Other examples of the increasing divide between the Creole elites and the colonial authority include the racial segregation in Freetown due to establishing an exclusive European residential area at Hill Station in 1904 with its own railway. Thus, the racial discrimination experienced by the Creole elite gradually caused them to identify with the grievances of the working class as common sufferers against the colony from which they benefitted. Through the more obvious demonstrations of racialism, it also became clearer that the strike was a symptom of the conflict between white imperialism and nascent African nationalism. The city council on January 15 proposed to discuss strikers' grievances with them, but this was shut down by the colonial secretary H.C. Luke on behalf of Slater, because giving the City Council permission to intervene would have legitimized the grievances of the strikers. Local newspapers, such as the Sierra Leone Weekly News and other publications, published editorials on the chronology of the strike and criticizing the governmental violent attempts to intimidate the workers. On January 21, a meeting of ratepayers and citizens took place at Wilberforce Memorial Hall and was chaired by the deputy mayor, the veteran politician J.A. Songo-Davies. At the meeting a committee of ten Africans and five Europeans was set up to negotiate terms with the government to end the strike. Another committee of seven citizens, including two Europeans, and seven workers' representatives was set up to meet and negotiate with the manager of the railway. Governor Slater was informed of these resolutions, but on February 15 he rejected the workers' counter-proposal to have the secretary of state establish a Commission of Enquiry and return working conditions to the status quo ante. Given that the government held the monopoly of coercive forces, neither the strikers nor the elite had any leverage. Nonetheless, the elite via the press, and public organizations, exhausted the options available to them‚Äîsuch as setting up a Strike Relief Fund at a \\"Support the Strike Meeting\\" on February 8, 1926‚Äîto support the workers' demands and show solidarity with their strike. By the end of March, the Strike Relief Fund had supported the strikers with nearly ¬£500 of donations, from the Sierra Leone Friendly Society in Lagos, Nigerian allies; Sierra Leoneans residing in Sekondi; Gold Coast and Creoles in Kumasi; as well as Sierra Leoneans in Monrovia, among others. In the end, the Strike Relief Fund came too late to sustain the strike, especially given the real material needs of the workers on strike.  End of the strike  On February 26, after six weeks of strike, the workers returned to work, forced to accept the government's terms. Less than a dozen people were arrested. Of the 200 people dismissed during the strike, 37 were pensionable workers, some with over twenty years' worth of experience, and twenty daily wagers were dismissed from the railway. The Secretary of the Railway Workers' Union, President of the Bo branch, and other Protectorate workers, were also dismissed. The President of the union was demoted and reassigned, and ended up resigning from the department. The job vacancies were filled with West Indian and local workers. Three months after the strike ended, all worker-paid daily wages were returned to their previous incremental rates. After the end of the strike, the union suffered from a lack of leadership and was replaced by a government-approved Railway Staff Committee. The end of the strike was a capitulation to superior forces, but this was one of the first instances of defiance and protest against the British in Sierra Leone, which presented a major challenge to the colonial government.  Political consequences  As a consequence of their support for the strikes, the elites, especially those serving in political functions, such as Dr. H.C Bankole-Bright and E.S. Beoku-Betts, who served as the first elected African members in the Legislative Council, received severe backlash. These hostile relations only served to galvanize the intelligentsia and the workers in an act of national resistance. This led to the government cracking down on the African elected members of various councils in the following ways: # Because the Creole elite had supported the strikers, after the end of the strike, the colonial government considered suspending the 1924 constitution, with which Africans had been able to gain representative power, since a number of Africans were elected to the Legislative Council. # The city council, an important political organ for aspiring Creole politicians, was dissolved in December 1926 in a political act expressing unbridled British discontent with the Creole elite; prior attempts to dissolve the city council had been blocked by the secretary of state for the colonies. Since the city council was a largely African-controlled political apparatus, its members served both on the Legislative and the city council, the colonial government perceived its political sway in favor of strikers as threatening. From then on, for the next twenty-two years, the municipality was directly administered by the colonial government. # In a further backlash against educated Africans, African civil servants were condemned for their part in defiance of the colonial authority and discriminated against, with the promotion of Africans, declining noticeably after 1926. In the end, according to academics such as Martin Kilson, this institutionally violent and repressive response of the government to the strikers, brought them, and the urban masses, into direct contact with its coercive power, providing an important insight to the workers, in their attempt at civil disobedience, into the role of force in maintaining colonial authority.  Labor unions in Sierra Leone  With the 1926 railway strike, the Railway Union set a strong precedent for political action and civil disobedience; the railways and mines became the focus for unionization, political organization and strike action. An example of this are the 1935 and 1938 strikes by workers at the then newly opened Sierra Leone Development Company (DELCO), mining iron ore at Marampa. Inspired by 1926 railway workers' strike against the unjust practices of the European industrial employers, they went on strike for better working conditions and compensation.Unions, such as the carpenter or shipwright union subsequently also arose around artisanal trades. This broad structure of trade unions, in addition to public sector workers, still exists and twenty-six organizations constitute the Sierra Leone Labour Congress.

Many years earlier her grandfather, who was obsessed with puzzles, supposedly hid a fortune on the island and constructed a game pointing to where the treasure was buried, but no one has thus far been able to find it. The students decide that hunting for the treasure would be an amusing way to pass the time, but the only clues the old man left behind center around a series of miniature moai statues that dot the island's landscape. But soon after their arrival the guests are confronted with a double murder, one that is seemingly impossible for anyone to have perpetrated. Egami ultimately theorizes that these killings are related to the death of Maria's cousin, who died on the island three years ago in an apparent drowning accident. And when even more people start to turn up dead, the other guests begin to fear that he may be right.

It was triggered by the death of the sitting member, Bartholomew Stubbs of the Labor Party, on 26 September 1917. The election was won by Samuel Brown, a member of the Subiaco Municipal Council who was standing for the Nationalist Party. Brown was one of six candidates endorsed by the Nationalists, and won the seat despite only polling 15.02 percent of the first-preference vote. Background Bartholomew Stubbs, a prominent trade unionist, had held Subiaco for the Labor Party since defeating Henry Daglish (a former premier) at the 1911 state election. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1916, and was returned unopposed at the September 1917 state election, but was killed in action in Belgium the same month.Bartholomew James Stubbs ‚Äì Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia.

The concept of \\"Skin Art\\" for the RSAF  The term \\"skin art\\" refers to a global and living art work made of body art, make-up, SFX, stage performance, video and music, with a strong message about issues related to the concept of ‚Äúbody‚Äù. The concept derives from the \\"Skin Art Manifesto\\", which states: \\"The omologation, the transformation of living beings in things and destruction on a global scale of nature are prevailing. Even if efforts are made to conceptualize and speculate about this, we have already started to feel it on our bodies.\\"  Events and actions related to the RSAF  During the 2015 edition of the IDAHOBIT: International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, the RSAF staged some flash happenings in public places in Florence and Catanzaro with painted models, to support the event.
