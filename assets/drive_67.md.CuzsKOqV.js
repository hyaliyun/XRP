Plot The plot concerns twin sisters, one who is modest and socially conservative, the other a free spirit who can't bear the constrictions of a traditional life. Their father's unhappiness over his bohemian daughter's lifestyle leads him to drink and dissolution. The sisters end up having the same man, Robin, in love with them, without him realizing they are two different people. The extant film ends at a most critical juncture, at which both sisters, Robin, and the father meet at a Paris boîte and are about to realize who each other is. There are several multiple exposures when the two sisters, both played by Betty Compson are on screen at once, which are skillfully done. Cast * Betty Compson as Nancy Brent / Georgina Brent * Clive Brook as Robin Field * Henry Victor as Louis Chadwick * A. B. Imeson as Mr. Brent * Olaf Hytten as Herbert Barnes * Daisy Campbell as Elizabeth Brent Production The film is based on the unpublished novel Children of Chance by Michael Morton. Alfred Hitchcock collaborated with Cutts on the film. Cutts and Hitchcock made the film quickly, as they wanted to make use of Betty Compson, who had appeared in their hit Woman to Woman (also 1923), before she returned to the United States.Low p.135 The film was made at the Gainsborough Pictures studio in Hoxton, London. Writing about the film in 1969, producer Michael Balcon said: > \\"Engrossed in our first production [Woman to Woman], we had made no > preparations for the second. Caught on the hop, we rushed into production > with a story called The White Shadow. It was as big a flop as Woman to Woman > had been a success.\\"Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light by > Patrick McGilligan [pg 754] Preservation status Long thought to have been a completely lost film, in August 2011 the National Film Preservation Foundation announced that the first three reels of the six-reel picture had been found in the New Zealand Film Archive. The film had been kept by collector Jack Murtagh for many years and had been donated to the archive after his death in 1989. One film can was mislabeled Two Sisters, while the other simply stated Unidentified American Film. Only later were they identified. Under the auspices of the NFPF, the film was preserved by the New Zealand Film Archive and the Academy Film Archive in 2012. The following year it was released on DVD by RLJE Films.

ASUH was chartered by the University of Hawai'i Board of Regents in 1912 and was originally named the Associated Students of the College of Hawai'i.  Background  =Budget= The student government manages a stock portfolio currently worth around $9.0 million, of which up to 5 percent is withdrawn annually to fund the senate's yearly budget. The student government money originally came from the 1975 sale of the Honolulu Stadium, and has been managed by students since 1980 when ASUH received $836,000 from the sale to invest and create a fund for student projects. ASUH was very active in promoting Hawaiian statehood. A senate resolution from 1959 sent to Congress. =Office= The ASUH office is currently located in Campus Center 211. Before the construction of the Campus Center, the ASUH office was located in Hemenway Hall along with the University's cafeteria, mail room, and bookstore. =Structure= ASUH is based on the parliamentary system and the executive and legislative branches are combined into one general assembly (the ASUH senate). The President and Vice president are popularly elected by the student body and the President presides over the senate. The President appoints committee chairs with the approval of the ASUH senate. The executive members of the senate consist of the President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and the four Senator at Large positions. In addition to the executive officers, 30 senators representing various colleges of the university make up the senate. The number of senators per college varies according to the population of the college, like the United States House of Representatives. The Student Court, which is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, consists of 7 members. The Court has final jurisdiction in all matters pertaining to the ASUH Constitution and By-Laws and in all cases resulting from ASUH senate legislation. =Elections= ASUH elections are held three times a year. The General Election takes place once a year during the Spring semester in April. During the General Election, all seats are open for election. Special Elections may take place during the Fall and Spring semesters to fill any vacancies that occur in the senate throughout the year. All senate members serve one year terms. Elections take place online at each University of Hawai'i students' MyUH account to ensure a fair election.  Positions  =Executive Committee= The Executive Committee is composed of the ASUH Executive Officers (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer), the Standing Committee Chairpersons, and Senators-At-Large. This committee coordinates the administration of all ASUH Senate programs, services and activities, hears Senate measures for First reading, hears complaints made against Senators or Executive Officers and decide the appropriate course of action, and responds to matters of immediate concern when the General Senate is not or is unable to be in session. President The ASUH President is the chief executive officer of the Associated Students of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and serves a one-year term (academic year). The ASUH President presides over the General Senate and Executive Committee, and its meetings. They represent ASUH in all official dealings with the University Administration, the faculty, and other organizations, firms, and persons, and is responsible for the general welfare of the ASUH. Vice President The ASUH Vice President assists the President in all Presidential duties, and exercises all Presidential powers and duties in the case of a vacancy, absence or incapacity in the office of the President. The ASUH Vice President is in charge of coordinating the activities of all ASUH standing committees and act as a liaison between the Senate and the standing committees. Secretary The ASUH Secretary maintains accurate and complete files of the minutes of all General Senate and Executive Committee meetings, as well as upkeeps the records of all committee meeting minutes. The Secretary maintains attendance, voting records, and codifies all Senate legislation. They perform duties as assigned by the President or the Senate. Treasurer The ASUH Treasurer, along with the Committee on Finance, drafts and introduces the ASUH Budget each fiscal year. The Treasurer publicizes and submits financial reports to the ASUH. They perform duties assigned by the President or the ASUH Senate. Senator at Large =Senate Positions= Senator for the College of Arts and Sciences Senator for the College of Engineering Senator for the College of Health Sciences & Social Welfare Senator for the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources Senator for the Hawai’inuiākea School of Hawaiian Knowledge Senator for the Shidler College of Business Senator for the School of Architecture Senator for the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology Senator for the School of Pacific and Asian Studies Senator for the School of Travel Industry Management  Standing Committees  =Current Standing Committees= The Senate currently has eight standing committees: the Campus Life committee, the Elections committee, the External Affairs committee, Finance committee, Investment and Long Range Planning committee, the Internal Affairs Committee, Student Affairs committee, and Undergraduate Academic Affairs. Each committee is overseen by a chair and vice-chair and each person on senate is required to be a member of two committees.

KTUH was an AM closed circuit operation and reached the residence halls. ASUH oversaw the funding and operations of KTUH for its first three years. On September 28, 1967, ASUH passed a resolution asking UH President Thomas Hamilton to apply for an FM educational license. In December 1968, under the sponsorship of ASUH Senator Ken Kuniyuki, ASUH passed another resolution petitioning the Board of Regents to apply for an FM educational license. On January 8, 1969, the Board of Regents authorized the administration to file for a 10 watt FM radio station. KTUH was issued its first educational FM license on September 29, 1969. The Speech-Communications Department obtained administrative control and line funding of KTUH after it became a FM station while ASUH continued to publish the station's program guides as a quasi-stipulation of the Board of Regents at the time of the transfer. In 1977, KTUH was overseen by the Director of the Bureau of Student Activities and developed as a student organization similar in design and intent to other previously chartered organizations. KTUH became a Chartered Student Organization on April 6, 1982, after a proposal was made to the Chancellor recommending that KTUH became a chartered organization. It was chartered under the organization name, Broadcast Communication Authority (BCA). Board of Publications: 1966 On June 11, 1966, the University of Hawai'i Board of Regents approved the reorganization and subsequent separation of the Board of Publications (BOP) from ASUH as a BOR Chartered Student Organization.  History of Advocacy and Legislation  =Food Pantry = =‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i Initiative: 2019-20 = The purpose of the ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i Initiative is to provide an opportunity and space for UHM students and community members to learn and speak the Hawaiian language at a centralized location on the Mānoa Campus. =U-PASS Initiative: 2008 – present = In order to help reduce traffic, combat the low availability of student parking, and decrease the cost of bus passes, issues which were affecting a large number of students, in 2008 ASUH proposed a mandatory $20 student fee that would grant all fee paying students a bus pass (U-PASS) for the entire semester. At that time, the U-PASS was an optional $100 per semester a student could choose to pay if they wanted a bus pass. Henry Cheng (97th senate), an ASUH senator who led the U-PASS initiative with ASUH Secretary Kiara Sakamoto (97th senate), said, \\"TheBus is hoping that the mandatory university wide U-Pass will encourage more students to ride the bus, which will help the company when it applies for federal funding.\\" The proposal had support from both students and public transit authorities. ASUH collected over 2,200 signatures from the student body supporting the U-PASS initiative, over 604 pieces of written testimony at UH Manoa libraries (77% in support), and over 1,500 online testimonies from an online U-PASS survey (90% in support). In addition, resolutions of support were passed by: the UH System Student Caucus, Sustainable Saunders, Manoa Neighborhood Board, McCully/Moili'ili Neighborhood Board, and the Honolulu City Council Committee on Transportation & Planning. ASUH proposed the student fee to the University of Hawaii Board of Regents on March 20, 2009. The U-PASS initiative was approved unanimously with no reservations for a 2-year pilot program. The U-PASS program began in Spring 2010 and will conclude in Fall 2011. ASUH will need to meet with the Board of Regents again if they wish to continue the U-PASS pilot program as a permanent program. =Campus Center Renovation and Fitness Center Construction: 2007= This project was a collaborative effort between the Associated Students of the University of Hawaii (ASUH) and the Campus Center Board (CCB).http://www.kaleo.org/campus-center-gets-m-for- renovation/article_16654b05-e96f-5167-9aaf-eb040e43a9b2.html?mode=jqm Both groups successfully worked with university, community, governmental and legislative stakeholders in order to successfully appropriate $38 millionhttp://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Nov/17/ln/FP611170369.html in revenue bonds to renovate existing campus center complex facilities and construct a state-of-the-art 64,000 sq. ft. fitness center exclusively for the general student population. \\"If the building has to be placed on the outskirts of campus, that raises some problems,\\" said Grant Teichman, the incoming president of the Campus Center Board. \\"The reason why that site was picked was for safety and security reasons,\\" he said, noting that since there is a lot of foot traffic, students will not have to walk alone to and from the site.http://archives.starbulletin.com/2008/09/15/news/story02.html =24-hour Sinclair Library and Student Services Funding: 2006= \\"The project was a priority to more than 1,000 students who sent testimony to the Legislature in February asking for the funding to keep the library open longer,\\" said Grant Teichman, the president of the undergraduate student association at UH- Manoa.http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/11/06/news/story04.html Students and student leaders also successfully led efforts to triple the amount of undergraduate academic advisors after submitting hundreds of pieces of testimony in support of robust funding to address desperately needed advising positions. In 2006, an emergency hold off on non-emergency advising was issued during the first two weeks of the semester due to a staff shortage with over 100 students a day being turned away.https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/18616/1/060118.pdf Before funding, there were only five (5) full-time and one part-time advisors serving more than 10,000 Arts and Sciences students at a ratio of 1:1,500—the recommended ratio, according to the National Academic Advising Association, is 1:300. =Preservation of Alcohol Sales at Aloha Stadium: 2006= In 2006, ASUH successfully led the effort against Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona in order to preserve alcohol sales at Aloha Stadium. The ASUH Senate voted unanimously to oppose the proposed alcohol ban in both the Aloha Stadium parking lot and seating areas. ASUH was the only major Hawaii organization to oppose the ban. Grant Teichman, a junior at the university and president of the student association, said the ban would infringe on the rights of those who can legally drink.\\"It's pretty clear across the nation that banning alcohol doesn't stop the problem,\\" said Teichman, noting that the student association represents 13,000 undergraduate students, of which half are age 21 or older. \\"Let's pick the best solution and not the fastest one.\\" ESPN further reported,\\"It's really going to hurt the students who just want to go out there and have a good time,\\" said Teichman, noting that 40 student senators representing all university programs have unanimously voted against the ban.\\"It will dramatically affect tailgating, one of the few traditions that our students have,\\" he said. =Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project: 2006= In 2006, ASUH began a high-profile advocacy initiative in support of the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project. ASUH first backed Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann in his effort to obtain federal funding for a mass transit solution for the City and County of Honolulu. Mayor Hannemann later lost ASUH support after his decision to remove the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus from the proposed initial operating 21-mile segment of rail.\\"If it doesn't go to UH-Manoa, this isn't a traffic solution,\\" said Grant Teichman, UH student president. \\"I think it's been very misleading to the public calling it 'Honolulu on the Move--A Mass Transit Solution.' This is not a mass transit solution.\\"http://www.k5thehometeam.com/story/6152390/council-selects-transit- route =Frear Hall Renovation Financing and Student Housing Services Audit: 2005-Present= In 2005, ASUH worked in concert with University administrators in order to successfully advocate for $100 million in revenue bonds and $25 million general obligation bonds enacted by H.B. 19http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2005/bills/HB19_SD2_.htm passed by the 2005 Hawaii State Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Linda Lingle. ASUH organized a media blitz around the creation of a tent city in order to demonstrate students would rather live on Bachman Lawn than in squalor at the dilapidated student housing facilities. While construction on the new Frear Hall was completed in 2008,http://archives.starbulletin.com/2008/06/30/news/story01.html it has already fallen into disrepair due to many of the same management issues plaguing UH student housing for decades.http://www.kaleo.org/news/campus- housing-still-needs-renovations-officials- say/article_e7beb59a-6ee1-11e4-9de6-df63dc85390b.html ASUH also spearheaded a comprehensive management audit for University of Hawaii Student Housing Services enacted by S.C.R. 97http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2006/bills/scr97_sd1_.pdf passed into law by the 2006 Hawaii State Legislature. The audit was then conducted by State Auditor Marion Higa.http://hawaii.gov/auditor/Reports/2007/07-03.pdf ASUH requested the audit after numerous reports of sexual harassment, embezzlement, waste, fraud, abuse and other alleged illegal activities by student housing employees were reported. ASUH attempted a mailing to students about their constitutional rights, but University administrators initially blocked its disbursement through the University mail system. Despite strong findings by the state legislature and state auditor, , students again report they live in squalor in poorly maintained student housing facilities.http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/31884966/uh-manoa-students- ramping-up-efforts-to-end-unsanitary-living-conditions =ASUH Student Shuttle Service: 1991= The ASUH recognized that the lack of parking stalls on the UH Mānoa campus was a great concern to undergraduates. In order to alleviate the parking shortage, ASUH Senator Paul Isono created a pilot shuttle program in the fall of 1990. Upon refinement of this program, an ASUH student shuttle service—running between Mānoa valley and the campus—would be implemented in the Spring of 1991, free of charge to ASUH members. =University of Hawai'i Student Caucus: 1990= In 1990, Ross Kamakahi, Jr., president of the Associated Students of Leeward Community College, and Keith Kamisugi, president of ASUH-Manoa, worked with a team of students from each campus of the system to create a coalition of student governments. Through several organizing meetings, most taking place in conjunction with the rotating meetings of the UH Board of Regents, the students agreed upon an affiliation that exists today as the University of Hawai'i Student Caucus (UHSC). Although the UHSC now functions as an entity recognized and supported by the university administration, it initially was meant to function as an unincorporated association outside of the administration in order to provide the highest degree of independence. Kamakahi and Kamisugi were elected the initial co- chairs of the UHSC. Although each campus had different levels of enrollment, the UHSC founders decided to set two delegates per campus in effort to recognize the importance of each campus, regardless of size. =UH Mascot: 1989= In 1989, ASUH allocated $1,600 to create a new mascot. Bows-O the mascot was pink, gap-toothed, and wore a cartoon version of a football helmet. It made its debut at Aloha Stadium during the 1989 homecoming game. The crowd showered the mascot with debris, catcalls, and insults. ASUH called an emergency session and recalled its act three days later. Bows-O was not the official name of the mascot. Mark Takai (ASUH President '89), stated that ASUH \\"sponsored a contest to give it a name that coincided with the university's nickname, the Rainbows. But before we found a winner, everyone was calling it Bows-O and the name stuck, much to our embarrassment.\\" =Full Funding for the University of Hawai‘i System: 1977= In protest to proposed funding cuts made by the Governor and the State Legislature, the ASUH unanimously voted to express its support for full funding in order maintain the quality of education in the University System. The ASUH also gave its full support to “SAVE US,” an organization established by the students to rally the student constituency, faculty, and administration in this issue. Calling for the University community to publicly and strongly showcase their support, the ASUH asked the University community to participate in a week-long rally from February 28, 1997 to March 4, 1977, culminating in a march to the State Capitol at 11:00AM on Friday, March 4. =Vietnam War Protest: 1970s= In May 1970, ASUH called for a week-long strike to protest the Vietnam War and America's bombing of Cambodia. The Leeward Community College student and faculty senates both voted to set aside May 11–16, 1970 as \\"a special week for consideration of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia.\\" About three thousand people attended a rally in Andrews Outdoor Theatre (now known as Andrew's Amphitheatre). Class attendance at Manoa was significantly lower during the days the protest was held. University of Hawai'i President Harlan Cleveland directed that no one be failed or given a lower grade for being on strike, since students \\"have the right to absent themselves on a matter of conscience.\\" =ASUH Lecture Series: 1960s= During the 1960s, ASUH sponsored visiting lectures at UH. Notable speakers include, Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer, Robert Simmons of the Louisiana White Citizens Council, Communist Party boss Gus Hall, and American Nazi fuhrer George Lincoln Rockwell. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke at Andrew's Amphitheatre. =Hawai'i Statehood: 1946 – 1959= Around 1946, ASUH began conducting a national letter-writing campaign advocating for statehood. Student delegates attended a mock convention two years later to draft a \\"model\\" state constitution. In March 1946, ASUH senator Ralph Toyota, who was chair of the now defunct Statehood committee, worked with ASUH senators Tom McCabe and Mary Matsumoto to produce a statehood brochure that was sent to all mainland colleges, asking students for their support in promoting statehood for Hawai'i. ASUH senator Patsy Mink, the ASUH Statehood committee chair in January 1948, met with U.S. Senator Guy Cordon of Oregon to get support for statehood. In 1948, the statehood bill that remained stuck in a U.S. Senate committee failed to move to the full Senate. It took another decade before Hawai'i became the 50th state of the United States in 1959. =Building of Hemenway Hall: 1938= Hemenway Hall, originally known as the Union building, was built in 1938. It consisted of a cafeteria, lounges, and offices for the student newspaper, the Ka Leo, and the ASUH office. ASUH and the student body contributed $12,000 while faculty, alumn, and the Women's Campus Club gave $10,000. The remaining $85,000 needed to construct the building was contributed by the regents. In 1940 the Union building was renamed after Charles Hemenway.

Saigo, together with Tsunejiro Tomita, became first in history of judo to be awarded Shodan by the founder of judo Jigoro Kano, who established the kyu-dan ranking system.Linhart and Fruhstuck (1998) p85 He was one of the Kōdōkan Shitennō or Four Guardians of the Kodokan along with Yoshitsugu Yamashita, Sakujiro Yokoyama, and Tsunejiro Tomita.Takahashi (2005) p ix Biography =Early life= Shiro Saigo was born on Feb 4, 1866 in Aizuwakamatsu, in the Fukushima Prefecture of Japan, the third son of a samurai, Shida Sadajiro. During his childhood, he trained in the fighting style of the Aizu clan, called oshikiuchi.In 1882, Saigo moved to Tokyo and in August of that year, he enrolled at the Kōdōkan, becoming Jigoro Kano's second student.Kano (2008) p20 In 1883, along with Tsunejiro Tomita, he became one of the first two to be awarded yudansha rank in any martial art. The very day of their graduation, he would take up the dojoyaburi challenge of Sakujiro Yokoyama, a much heavier jujutsuka, and defeated him, which moved Yokoyama to join the school as well. A man of extreme agility, Shiro was known for the nickname of \\"Cat\\" due to his skill to land on his feet when thrown, a skill he had observed in actual cats and that he trained by jumping off the second floor of a building. He was also known as \\"Octopus Feet\\" for his ability to avoid losing his footing. He developed a personal technique called \\"yama arashi\\", possibly related to the modern judo technique of the same name, though according to Tsunejiro Tomita it was lost after his death. =Judo challenges= Saigō was responsible for an early surge of popularity for Kodokan Judo, when he demonstrated its superiority by easily defeating a much larger opponent: Similarly, Saigō fought on behalf of Kodokan in 1884, when three fighters of the Yōshin-ryū jūjutsu school named Matsugoro Okuda, Daihachi Ichikawa and Morikichi Otake came to challenge their members. As Kano was out at the moment, they only found Shiro and his colleagues Yokoyama and Tsunejiro Tomita, but those decided to answer the challenge by themselves. Shiro defeated Okuda, throwing him down thrice before finishing him out with his yama arashi. Okuda suffered a concussion and had to be stretchered out. Kano was not pleased with their behavior when he found out, thinking they had shown themselves too eager to fight, but anyway their victories helped to increase Kodokan's renown in Japan. Saigō also took part in the Kodokan-Totsuka rivalry, participating in the tournament between Kōdōkan and the Totsuka branch of Yōshin-ryū hosted by chief inspector Michitsune Mishima. Shiro was sorted to fight Entaro Kochi, a much larger jujutsuka. The size difference was such that it was reported to look like a match between a child and an adult. Controlling the match, Kochi tried to throw him with harai goshi and uchi mata, but Saigō slipped out and landed on his feet every time, making Entaro increasingly tired. Saigō then tried to capitalize on with tomoe nage, which Entaro blocked and tried to come back with an osoto gari with no success. Finally, at around 15 minutes an exhausted Entaro left himself open, and the judoka managed to execute his yama arashi. Although his head hit the ground, Entaro got up again, after which Saigo scored another yama arashi, breaking Kochi's shoulder and forcing him to give up the match. The Kōdōkan won most of the matches that day, and the rival school's master Hidemi Totsuka was forced to praise Saigō, saying to Kano \\"you really have a wonderful student.\\" Following this victory, the Governor of Chiba Prefecture Mamoru Funakoshi personally travelled to the Kōdōkan dojo to attend a lecture in judo methods accompanied by the leading men of the Totsuka Yōshin-ryū, among them Hidemi Totsuka and Teisuke Nishimura.Brian N. Watson, Judo Memoirs of Jigoro Kano After seeing Saigō perform a demonstration of randori, Totsuka increased his praises, stating \\"the 'genius' word might have been created for someone like Shiro Saigō.\\"Jigoro Kano, Kokushi Saigō also fought against Shusaburo Sano, a Totsuka jujutsuka who was supposedly strong enough to bend iron rods with his arms and shatter thick boards with his fists. Sano outweighed Shiro by 30 kg and had trained specifically to counter his yama arashi technique. Indeed, he countered it, throwing Saigō down and pinning him with his weight, but the judoka escaped and applied ude-gatame, making the jujutsuka surrender. =Departure from Kodokan= In 1890, Saigō was forced to leave the Kōdōkan due to his involvement in a street brawl. According to sources, a drunken Shiro challenged a sumotori named Araumi, knocking him out with a throw. However, after the throw Arauma would have bitten Saigo's leg, which caused a brawl between Shiro's entourage of judoka and Araumi's sumo stable. Saigo also attacked many policemen who attempted to break it up, injuring some of them and even throwing some others into a nearby river, which got him in jail until Kano could get him out. He retired to Nagasaki, devoting the rest of his life to kyūdō.Stevens and Shirata (1983) p5; As a sign of pardon, however, Kano conceded him the 6th dan after his death. The main character in Akira Kurosawa's 1943 directorial debut, Sugata Sanshirō, was based on Shiro Saigo, the film being based on the novel of the same name written by Tsunejiro Tomita's son, Tsuneo.

The terminology 'cocktail' refers to the fact that the drug probes are given together. The Cooperstown cocktail consists of four drugs that are considered specific substrates for four cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. One of the drugs (caffeine) provides, through its metabolites, substrates for two additional enzymes (see next paragraph). The drugs and the enzymes they probe are as follows - caffeine (probes CYP1A2, N-acetyltransferase 2, xanthine oxidase), midazolam (probes CYP3A), omeprazole (probes CYP2C19) and dextromethorphan (probes CYP2D6). After giving the cocktail, the concentrations of the drugs and their metabolites in plasma (for midazolam and omeprazole) and urine (for caffeine and dextromethorphan) are determined at various times. By analysing these concentrations, it is possible to determine the activity (i.e. the phenotype) of the relevant enzyme. Caffeine can be used as a probe for three different enzymes by measuring several of its urinary metabolites and comparing their relative concentrations.

The members of the SFJ inside their compounds (churches) wear monastic robes with varying colour of rope depending on the seniority of the member. There are several levels of member within the SFJ with The Master at the top then his advisers and deacons and deaconesses followed by normal members and new members who are known as Neophytes, Neophytes must undergo a process known as purification which can last anywhere from one month to three months, this period is designed to completely brainwash the neophytes and turn them against the outside world and embrace the master as a prophet of Jesus. Most Neophytes hand over their possessions and savings to the SFJ during purification, They are also fed a very basic diet and bombarded by brainwashing techniques and selected passages or quotes from the bible that support the needs of the SFJ. once a Neophyte has completed purification they may join what are called God Squads which go out into the street to sell a booklet called 'the sayings of the master' for $2. Between the profits from booklets, possessions of the neophytes and the donations brought in from his TV shows The Master has been able to buy a luxury yacht and stash several million dollars in numbered Swiss bank accounts.

He fought unsuccessfully against creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Birth and education Colby was born on 25 March 1901, son of a doctor, and was raised in Woking Surrey, England. He attended St Wilfred's, a preparatory school, at Bexhill-on-Sea between the ages of seven and thirteen, and in 1914 went on to Charterhouse, a school that taught the virtues of leadership, public service and keeping a cool head in emergencies. An excellent sportsman, he played both cricket (in the 1st XI) and football for the school. Colby retained a passion for cricket throughout his life. It was said that when Governor of Nyasaland he delayed a meeting of his executive council for half an hour so he could listen to the closing overs of a test match. Colby won an open scholarship to Clare College at the University of Cambridge, as well as a leaving exhibition from Charterhouse, where he read Natural Sciences (Chemistry) from 1919, taking a third-class degree in 1922. He played poker and tennis and owned a Norton motorcycle which he used to go on trips to London. He was also known quite frequently to climb into college after hours up a wall which was considered by a fellow undergraduate and Alpine mountaineer to be a difficult and dangerous climb . Early career After leaving university, Colby spent a year as an assistant master at his old prep school, and a year working in a fellmongers factory at Galashiels. He then applied for an appointment in the Colonial Service, and was posted to Nigeria in 1925. In Nigeria he was first a District Officer in the Northern region at a salary of £500, with £60 advanced for essential equipment. His duties involved lengthy tours on horseback in the hot, dry climate of the North to check on tax collection, the courts and public works. His health during this period was poor, and he always had a jaundiced appearance, perhaps in part due to poor diet. When on leave in England in 1930, Colby was introduced to Lilian Florence Illingworth, then aged 25. They became engaged, and were married on 17 January 1931. He was unable to take his wife back with him to Nigeria, since his position did not allow for a wife, and it took a year before he obtained a suitable post in the Lands and Mines department in the Kaduna secretariat, where he was joined by Lilian. Colby was posted to Kontagora in 1935 as District Officer, an isolated post. He was an energetic and efficient administrator, improving the roads and increasing crop production. In 1939 he became an Assistant Secretary in the Finance branch of the Lagos secretariat. He rose quickly through the ranks to be made an Administrative Secretary in 1945, in which role he acted as Chief Secretary and Governor's Deputy. This appointment was created for him by the governor, Sir Arthur Richards, and represented an unusual advancement over the heads of scores of other colonial officers . In 1947 he was awarded CMG in the Birthday Honours List. He was knighted two years later. Governor of Nyasaland Colby was appointed Governor of Nyasaland by Secretary of State Arthur Creech Jones, arriving there on 7 January 1948. This was a Class III Governorship under the Governors' Pension Act and so somewhat disappointing. It carried a salary of £2,500 per annum with a £500 duty allowance . He inherited an awkward problem of land allocation. The BCA Company owned large areas of land, some densely populated, that could not be developed without evicting the tenants. Other estates were underdeveloped, while there was a shortage of land for the Africans. A Land Planning Committee recommended that the government acquire some of this land for use by Africans. In November 1948, at Colby's recommendation, the composition of the Legislative Council was changed to include two African and one Asian \\"unofficials\\" and three officials. Colby supported greater educational opportunities for Africans, but his influence was negative. He opposed compulsory attendance, as requested by the chiefs, and supported age limits for entry into school. The latter harmed girls, who would often delay entering school until a later age. Colby accepted the position of Chief Scout of the Nyasaland Boy Scouts, and his wife became President of the Girl Guides, giving both these organisations a boost. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Colby was opposed to the creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland against the wish of African leaders such as James Frederick Sangala. He advised the Colonial Office to exclude Nyasaland from the planned federation, but his advice was ignored. The Conservative government pushed ahead with plans, deciding in a January 1953 conference that the federation would come into effect in August 1953. When the federation was inaugurated there were riots in which eleven Africans were killed and many injured. For a period, the moderate influence of the Nyasaland African Congress was weakened. In a letter to his successor, Robert Armitage, Colby said: \\"I advised originally against the inclusion of Nyasaland not because I objected so much to the idea of federation but rather because I was convinced that there was no goodwill towards us or understanding of our problem in Salisbury. I fear I have to say that this had been born out in practice. I do not believe that federation can succeed unless there is a complete change of heart in Salisbury – at present I can see no sign of this\\". With federation a fait accompli, Colby said \\"Our job and primary object in the next few years must be to allay African fears ... and to convince the African population that Federation is in their best interests and indeed is in the interest of all communities in this territory\\". Colby recommended giving Africans a greater say in government, including opening more civil service jobs to Africans who were qualified, and paying more attention to African leaders. He expected that Nyasaland would eventually become self-governing, but not for many years. In July 1955, Colby announced a radical change in the structure of the legislative council to take effect after elections in 1956. The new council would consist of eleven colonial officials and eleven elected representatives. Of the \\"unofficials\\", six would be European, elected by the European Voter's Roll, and five African, elected by the three Provincial Councils. In January 1956, in one of his last communications as Governor, Colby pointed out to the Colonial Office the inequities of revenue distribution in the federation. He said that revenue from Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia had been \\"devoted to bolstering a bankrupt and under-taxed Southern Rhodesia and the major part of the federal government's share of loan funds raised since federation has been spent or earmarked in Southern Rhodesia\\". He warned against creeping changes in federal policy on non-African agriculture, and warned that this could lead to \\"a dangerous security situation\\". Colby told Armitage that his greatest problem would be the \\"conglomeration of smart alecks\\" at the Colonial Office. Colby left Nyasaland in March 1956. He died in Manchester on 22 December 1958.

Besides being an architect and able musician, he was, unusually, a gifted landscape artist and produced many fine paintings of Natal scenery. He founded the Durban Art Gallery in 1892. Life He was born at 11 Roxburgh Street in Edinburgh on 24 September 1849 the son of William Methven. He is thought to be named after a great uncle, Cpt Cathcart Methven of the East India Company killed in a fall from a horse in Calcutta in 1823. He was apprenticed as an engineer with John Sang in Kirkcaldy from 1866 70 1871. He then worked with Paley and Austin of Lancaster as Clerk of Works for the reconstruction of St John's Episcopal Church in Greenock. He then joined the London firm of Robert Kinipple as assistant harbour engineer at Greenock in Scotland. In 1886 he replace Kinipple as engineer-in-chief of the Greenock Harbour Trust. As a prominent Victorian engineer, he became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). In February 1888 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Swan, John Gray McKendrick, George Chrystal, and Sir John Murray. He emigrated to South Africa in autumn 1888, when appointed Durban's harbour engineer, his orders were to remove a sandbar obstructing shipping at the harbour entrance, forcing passengers and cargo to be moved by lighter. Methven's plans to get rid of the bar by extending the North Pier and using the scouring action of tidal currents, brought him into conflict with a prominent lawyer, Attorney General and politician, Harry Escombe, who wanted to rely on dredging alone. Consequently, Methven was dismissed on 11 July 1894. This led to a tremendous uproar ending in Escombe's resignation. Much later, in 1918, the South African government granted him £500 in recognition of his services with development of the harbour. His other recommendation that the Umhlatuzi Lagoon be developed as a second harbour for Natal, was also followed in the 1970s and is now known as Richards Bay. Not content to remain idle, Methven started his own successful business as consulting civil and marine engineer, architect and surveyor on 13 December 1895. He undertook to survey all harbours on the south-east and southern coastline, ranging from Port St Johns (1897) to Port Alfred, Kalk Bay and Mossel Bay (1901), Richards Bay and Cape Town (1902), East London (1901 and 1910), Lourenço Marques (1909/10) and Beira and Port Elizabeth (1911). Methven was also President of the Natal Institute of Architects (1905–1908) and a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (FRIBA). Methven practiced as architect and was one of the founder members of the Natal Institute of Architects. He was an enthusiastic trout fisherman and an accomplished musician. His involvement in the art world led to his being President of the Natal Society of Artists in 1908, 1912 and 1915. He drew up specifications for the building of the organs in the Durban and Pietermaritzburg Town Halls, and edited A Century of Progress in Natal, 1824–1924 published in Pietermaritzburg. Methven's first solo exhibition took place in Johannesburg in 1921. His work may be seen in the Africana Museum, Durban Art Gallery, Local History Museums, Tatham Art Gallery and the Killie Campbell Collections. He also painted a number of landscapes of his hometown, Greenock. He died in Pietermaritzburg in South Africa on 30 August 1925. Family He was married. His children included Alexander Methven and Iain Lambert Methven. His assistant, James Buchanan Pentland-Smith, married his eldest daughter.

These proteins are important for transporting substances into cells and are found in all living organisms.  biological function of ABC systems  Most ABC systems function in the transport of a compound across a membrane into the cell (importer) or to the exterior (exporter), for which the system generates energy by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The ABC transporters occur in all living organisms. An ABC transporter system consist minimally of two components: an ATP binding cassette and a transmembrane domain or membrane spanning domain. These are usually separate proteins or can occur as protein domains. A typical ABC transporter is composed of two nucleotide binding domains that energize transport via ATP hydrolysis and of two membrane spanning domains that act as a membrane channel for the substrate. Importers require a solute binding protein that recognizes and binds the substrate. The different partners of an ABC system are generally encoded by neighboring genes.  Features  The ABC proteins form a superfamily encoded by large families of paralogous genes. Sequence analysis shows that members of the ABC superfamily may have diverged from common ancestral forms and permits to organize ABC proteins into sub-families. The classification of ABC systems into (sub-)families can help to predict which substrates may be transported by the system. ABCdb is a public resource, from which one can: * select a strain from the tree of species and view all its ABC systems, classified into (sub-)families. * for a particular ABC (sub-)family, compare all the proteins of completely sequenced prokaryotes. * use a sequence and blast it against ABCdb to find annotations for similar proteins  See also  * Membrane transport protein * TCDB Transporter Classification database * ABC transporters * ATP-binding domain of ABC transporters * Transmembrane domain of ABC transporters References External links * http://www-abcdb.biotoul.fr/ ABCdb website ABC transporters Biological databases Education in Toulouse ","title":"ABCdb"},{"id":"31190295","text":"Thomas Dacres (1609–1668) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1646 to 1648.

It is located south of Kotzebue, Alaska. The ground control intercept (GCI) station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air Support Group, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. History Kotzebue AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. Construction of the station, began in 1957 and was completed in April 1958. The Army Transportation Corps undertook the project. The station site was located on the Kotzebue Sound of Western Alaska, and equipment and construction material was floated by LST or a barge to a dock built on the coast . Initially, there were no roads, which had to be built as part of the construction effort. Each item had to be hauled up from the port area along the newly constructed road to the permanent station site. The station consisted of a power/heating plant, water and fuel storage tanks, gymnasium and other support office buildings. Two other buildings contained living quarters, work areas, and recreational facilities plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The station buildings were, except for the civil engineering building connected by heated hallways. As a result, personnel stationed there, with only very few exceptions, were able to wear \\"summer\\" uniforms year round, unless they had a need to go outside during the winter season. The coverings of the station's three radar towers were heated from within to keep the covering from becoming brittle from extreme cold, and thus subject to being damaged or destroyed by high winds. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. A 5-mile road connected the station to Kotzebue, where a civil airport was located and a town, one of Alaska's major tourist attractions. The 748th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, activated in April 1958 operated AN/FPS-8, AN/FPS-4, AN/FPS-6, AN/FPS-20, and AN/FPS-87A Kotzebue AFS operated as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft deployed to the forward operating base at Galena AFB toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In March 1953, the Manual Air Defense Direction Center (MCC) at Murphy Dome AFS near Fairbanks exercised control over Kotzebue's radars where the data was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force- owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Kotzebue site was activated in 1958. It was inactivated in 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1983, Kotzebue received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO program. It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. No longer needed, the 748th ACWS was inactivated on l November 1983 and the station re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Kotzebue LRR Site was transferred to Eleventh Air Force with the re-designation of AAC. In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Current status Today very little of the former Kotzebue Air Force Station remains. The site is controlled by the Pacific Air Forces 611th Air Support Group, based at Elmendorf AFB. It is generally unattended; a few civilian contractors access the site for maintaining the facilities.

Major contributions His research has played a determining role in Canadian policies with regards to children and media, as well as on the diffusion and cultural impact of information and communication technologies. In terms of policy impact on children and youth, his work began addressing policy concerns as early as the 1970s, when he published his research on first-time exposure to television and their effects on Inuit children in northern Québec.Caron, A.H.

The label was founded in the mid-1970s by Bernard S. Vick and Andy Titcombe. Originally based in London, United Kingdom, it currently has its headquarters in Cumbria. History Loose Records was formed in the mid- seventies in London. It rose from the ashes of Keswick Music, a joint partnership between Bernard S. Vick and Andy Titcombe. Keswick Music had been responsible for the release of the Carlisle United football team record to celebrate their promotion into the First Division of the English Football League. Although this single \\"Looking Good\\" achieved good sales, three subsequent releases by different artistes failed to attract enough sales and the partnership was dissolved. Loose was originally started as a publishing company but developed into a label in the heyday of UK independent labels in the late 1970s. As the label developed it became clear that punk rock and heavy metal were breaking through in a big way and thus, an additional label, Brickyard, was formed to allow Loose to run specialist genres. The label was originally distributed in the UK by Pinnacle Entertainment (UK) one of the large UK independent distributors; in addition, Loose linked with Animus Records in a deal signed at Midem. The label had its headquarters at 296 Chiswick High Road in West London – sharing the premises with the HQ of independent record store chain Tune In To 269 which was also run by Andy Titcombe. The label had success not only in the UK but internationally as well with artistes like . Demo tapes were regularly received but most artistes were signed because they had close connections to someone working with Loose or else they were customers of the shop. One notable band that failed this simple A&R; test was The Housemartins! As a publishing company Loose had success in the disco market in the 1980s as well. In the late 1980s, Tune In To 269 closed, and the label and the publishing company went into a period of dormancy. In the mid-1990s, the label was relaunched, and a decision was then taken to change direction towards country music. This was followed by the singing of Lemon Grass, The Wurzels and Cattle Company as well as country music writers. Distribution was switched to RCA / BMG, and this immediately led to a top 100 entry in the UK Singles Chart in 1995 for The Wurzels with \\"I Want To Be An Eddie Stobart Driver\\". The label continues to concentrate on country music but true to its name, it reserves the right to delve into any genre it fancies.

The play provides a backstory for the characters of Peter Pan, Mrs Darling, Tinker Bell and Hook, and serves as a prequel to J. M. Barrie's Peter and Wendy. After a premiere in California at the La Jolla Playhouse, the play transferred to Off-Broadway in 2011 and opened on Broadway on April 15, 2012. The show ended its Broadway run on January 20, 2013, and reopened Off-Broadway once again at New World Stages in March 2013, ending in January 2014. Plot =Act I= An ensemble of actors enters a bare stage. After some bickering, they welcome the audience to the world of the play and describe what's in store: flying, dreaming, adventure and growing up. They encourage the audience to use their imaginations to visualize the British Empire. Transported to a bustling port, we meet Lord Leonard Aster; his precious daughter Molly; and her nanny, Mrs. Bumbrake. Two identical trunks are delivered to the port. One contains a precious cargo belonging to the Queen, who has appointed Lord Aster as its custodian. He’ll voyage with the trunk aboard The Wasp, the fastest ship afloat, helmed by his old school chum Captain--Robert Falcon Scott--bound for the remote kingdom of Rundoon. The other trunk, a decoy full of sand, will be carried by the old, weather-beaten ship The Neverland, captained by the sinister Bill Slank. Amidst the bustle of the port, while no one is looking, Slank marks the Queen's trunk — the one supposed to go on The Wasp — with a chalk X. Then, at the last moment, he swaps the trunks. The Queen's cargo is loaded aboard The Neverland, and the identical sand-filled trunk is placed on The Wasp. Grempkin, the schoolmaster of St. Norbert's Orphanage for Lost Boys, sells Slank three orphan boys - Prentiss, Ted, and a nameless orphan known only as Boy. Grempkin tells the boys they’ll serve as helpers to the King of Rundoon, but Slank indicates a more sinister outcome for the lads. After realizing that no one cares enough to say goodbye to the orphans, the Boy proclaims that he hates grownups. The Neverland: Deck A gang of malnourished sailors prepares The Neverland for the Rundoon voyage. A squadron of British navy seamen, led by Lieutenant Greggors, arrives to fetch Lord Aster, who is paying Slank to take care of Molly. Molly and Mrs. Bumbrake are traveling aboard The Neverland, which is taking a slower, safer route to Rundoon than The Wasp. As Molly and Lord Aster bid farewell, a crate containing the orphan boys bursts open and The Boy catches Molly's eye. Before he departs, Lord Aster confides the mission's details to Molly, speaking in Dodo, a language known only to dodo birds and a handful of very special humans. Aster places an amulet around his neck and a matching one around Molly's. He warns her never to take it off or let anyone else touch it, and charges her to use it if she is ever in trouble. Molly protests and asks to be part of the mission aboard The Wasp, but Lord Aster convinces her to stay aboard The Neverland by promising her an exotic vacation once the mission is complete. Molly comments that she is only an apprentice Starcatcher, a word that catches Slank's ear. Aster departs for The Wasp, and Slank ditches the pleasant facade and turns nasty. Alf, a kindly old seafarer, escorts Molly and Mrs. Bumbrake to their cabin below the deck of the ship, and The Neverland sets sail. The Neverland: Molly's Cabin In their cabin, Mrs. Bumbrake describes to Molly a family she used to work for in Brighton. The cruel master would beat the cook, an island boy who was an artist in the kitchen. On his way to feed the pigs, Alf checks in on the ladies and flirts with Mrs. Bumbrake. Molly, a lover of all animals, follows Alf out. The Neverland: Ship's Bowels Unseen, Molly trails Alf on the long journey to the bilge room. On the way, she discovers sailors gambling, singing hymns, and torturing Mack, the world's most inept sailor. The Neverland: Bilge Dungeon As Alf enters the bilge, Molly slips in behind him, unseen. The three filthy orphans gather around Alf and his bucket of food. Prentiss, who identifies himself as the group's leader, demands to speak to the Captain, while the food-obsessed Ted dives into the food, only to realize he's been fed worms. The Boy asks Alf about their fate but he refuses to answer. Alf leaves and Molly appears, startling the boys. Prentiss again asserts his leadership, but the Boy challenges him and captivates Molly. Molly coaxes names out of Ted and Prentiss, but the Boy doesn’t have one. The Boy lashes out, but Molly challenges him, which sparks something new in him. Molly leads Ted and Prentiss to find real food, but the Boy doesn’t follow. The Boy flashes back to St. Norbert's Orphanage for Lost Boys, where Grempkin is lashing him. The Boy imagines having a family. Molly re-enters to fetch the Boy, saving him from his nightmare. The Wasp: Captain's Cabin Greggors escorts Lord Aster inside the ship and then reveals that his real name is Smee and the seamen are pirates. Captain Scott is bound and gagged, and the real seamen are in chains below. Smee demands the key to the trunk, but Lord Aster refuses. Just then, the pirate crew begins to tremble in fear. Smee elaborately introduces the most feared pirate captain on the high seas, Black Stache, who dramatically enters, then immediately vomits into a bucket. Black Stache, so- called because of his trademark facial hair, is a sometimes poetic but malapropism-prone psychopath who threatens to find and kill Molly unless Aster gives him the key to the trunk. When Aster refuses, he steals the trunk key from his pocket. The amulet around Lord Aster's neck begins to glow. The Neverland: Passageway Molly's matching amulet starts to glow and the boys notice. Molly divulges that her father is on a secret mission for the Queen. Mrs. Bumbrake comes searching for Molly, so she and the boys turn to escape down a corridor and encounter a flying cat in Slank's cabin. Molly knows that the only thing that could make a cat fly is starstuff; she realizes that the Queen's treasure is on the wrong ship. She tries to distract the boys from the starstuff by suggesting a bedtime story. The Boy unexpectedly blurts out his darkest secrets and dreams. Molly entrances the boys with her story, and leads them away from Slank's cabin by telling them the tale of Sleeping Beauty. The Wasp: Captain's Cabin Back on The Wasp, Stache opens the trunk only to find ... sand. Smee deduces that Slank must have swapped the trunks. Stache complains to Lord Aster about his quest to find a great hero to oppose so he can be a great villain, and commands that the ship be turned around. The Wasp pursues The Neverland. The Neverland: Ship's Bowels After the boys have been lulled to sleep by Molly's bedtime story, Lord Aster contacts her through the amulet and warns her that pirates have commandeered The Wasp. Lord Aster instructs Molly to bring the Queen's trunk to him once The Wasp catches The Neverland. Aster tells Molly that she is now a part of the mission. The Boy awakens and catches the end of Molly's communication; he insists that she tell him what is going on. The Neverland: Deck From the ship's deck, Molly tells the Boy about Starcatchers, a handful of people whose sole mission is to protect starstuff. The Boy insists that Molly prove she is an apprentice Starcatcher, so she puts her hand around her amulet, closes her eyes, and floats a few inches above the deck. Molly explains that a Starcatcher's primary duty to collect starstuff as it falls to earth and dispose of it in the world's hottest active volcano, Mount Jalapeño, which is on Rundoon. The Boy tells Molly that he is going there to help the King, but she bursts his bubble and explains that King Zarboff is actually evil. He would kill for even a thimble of starstuff. As the Boy laments, Slank enters and throws him overboard. The Boy, who cannot swim, starts to drown. Molly dives into the ocean and saves him. The Neverland & The Wasp As a hurricane stirs up in the ocean, The Wasp appears on the horizon. Molly drags the Boy back on board and revives him. Slank sees The Wasp and assumes that the British navy must have discovered the trunk swap. He prepares to outrun the other ship, but the Boy takes the wheel and changes course. In the midst of the storm, the wheel flies off the deck and goes spinning out to sea; The Neverland lurches. Below deck, Alf is again flirting with Mrs. Bumbrake, who stops his advances in order to find Molly. On the bow of The Wasp, Stache and Smee are delighted that The Neverland is heading straight toward them. When the two ships meet, the pirates board The Neverland and fight with the sailors. In the bilge, Molly congratulates the Boy for doing something big. She then dashes off to get the trunk from Slank's cabin; the Boy realizes that there are more important things than saving his own neck and runs to help Molly. On deck, Slank and Stache square off, but just as Stache gets the upper hand, The Neverland splits in two. As Molly and Mrs. Bumbrake struggle to move the trunk, Slank intercepts them. Mrs. Bumbrake throws the ship's cat in Slank's face, and Alf steps in to throw Slank overboard, where he drowns. Molly asks the Boy to stall the pirates while she gets the Queen's trunk to The Wasp, and the Boy sits on the sand trunk to “protect the treasure.” Stache encounters the Boy and tries to lure what he thinks is the Queen's trunk out from under him. Stache offers the Boy a place on his crew and tries out some Piratical names for him. One of them, Pirate Pete, strikes a chord with the Boy and he chooses a name for himself: Peter. Losing patience, Stache knocks Peter off the trunk, opens it, and realizes he's been had. As Peter celebrates his own cleverness, Stache knocks him overboard. Lord Aster calls to Molly and tells her to bring him the trunk; Molly is torn between saving Peter and obeying her father. Knowing that the starstuff will float, she pushes it in the water and tells Peter to float to a nearby island. Alf and Mrs. Bumbrake search for flotsam to make a raft; Ted and Prentiss cling to one another; Stache commands Smee to follow the trunk; Molly dives into the ocean and swims after Peter; Peter rides the trunk toward the island with fish swimming in its golden wake. =Act II= A group of Mermaids recount in vaudevillian song their experience of being transformed from regular fish after swimming in the wake of the starstuff. The Mountain-Top Lookout Point Atop a mountain on the island, Peter absorbs the freedom of open skies and clean air for the first time in his life. A yellow bird flies around his head, pestering him, before fluttering off. Ted and Prentiss arrive, and Peter enlists them in the mission to get the trunk to the Wasp so they can leave the island. In the distance, Mrs. Bumbrake and Alf paddle toward the shore on a makeshift raft. The boys hide the trunk and go in search of branches. The Jungle The boys descend the mountain, and go deeper and deeper into the dark jungle. They are quickly separated and soon realize that they are not alone. Stache and Smee are also creeping about the jungle and Molly, a champion swimmer, has arrived as well. Mollusk Territory The island's natives, the Mollusks, capture the boys. The chief, Fighting Prawn, sentences them to death, a fate he reserves for all English trespassers because he was sold into slavery by the English. They are to be sacrificed and fed to Mr. Grin, the island's hungriest crocodile. The boys offer the gift of a bedtime story to the Mollusks, hoping they will fall asleep, allowing the boys to escape. Fighting Prawn accepts the offering, timing them with a kitchen timer he wears as a relic of his slavery as a kitchen boy. The boys perform Sleeping Beauty for the tribe, but because they all fell asleep during Molly's rendition of the story, none of them can really remember how it goes. Molly approaches and watches from behind some trees. At the climax, Molly blurts out that the boys have ruined the story. The Mollusks are amused (especially because Molly's name means \\"Squid Poop\\" in their language), but decide that the English invaders must die anyway, and toss them into Mr. Grin's cage. Mr. Grin's Cage Trapped inside Mr. Grin's cage, Molly and the boys bicker about what to do. Molly formulates a plan, impulsively kissing Peter as she thinks, to his shock. Peter gets Mr. Grin to open his mouth, and Molly tosses her amulet in. Mr. Grin grows to an enormous size, bursting out of the cage and floating away as Molly and the boys flee. The Mollusks are furious and pursue them. The Beach Smee and Stache cannot find the trunk; Stache decides to trick the kids into bringing it to him. Mr. Grin, now several times his normal size, floats toward them, forcing Stache and Smee to take cover in the jungle. The Jungle's Edge Peter wants to get off the island, and begins gathering materials for a raft. Molly reminds him of the trunk and the mission. Out in the sea, the boys and Molly notice a flashing light. It is Lord Aster, contacting Molly using Norse Code (a system akin to Morse Code used by ancient Vikings.) Lord Aster instructs Molly to bring the trunk to the beach. The boys and Molly race to the top of the mountain to retrieve the trunk, with the Mollusks in hot pursuit. To give Molly room to reach the mountain, Peter draws the Mollusks' attention to himself. The Chase And The Fall Peter runs up the mountain with the Mollusks on his tail. The yellow bird returns and distracts Peter, who falls into a crevice and finds himself in a shimmering lake of golden water, far, far underground. Peter floats, neither drowning nor afraid, and gazes up at a mermaid. The Underground Grotto Floating in the grotto's golden water, Peter is greeted by the mermaid who calls herself Teacher. Teacher explains her transformation from fish to mermaid, and describes the power of starstuff to fulfill dreams. Teacher and the island give Peter a second name — Pan. Teacher reveals that Pan has two meanings. The first is fun, frolic, anarchy and mischief - all things a boy likes. Before telling Peter the second meaning of Pan, Teacher reminds Peter about the trunk. Peter climbs out of the grotto and bolts back up to the mountaintop. The Stormy Night Molly, Prentiss and Ted arrive atop the mountain and fear Peter's demise. In the distance, they spot Mrs. Bumbrake and Alf sailing toward the island on a makeshift raft, using Mrs. Bumbrake's bloomers as a sail. Molly, Prentiss and Ted drag the trunk toward the beach. A storm begins as night falls, making the journey dark, unpleasant, and frightening. As the others fall asleep, Peter appears and surprises Molly. Peter tries to get in the trunk, but Molly tells him that exposure to so much starstuff is very dangerous. They discuss their impulsive kiss in the cage, and Molly waxes philosophical about avoiding sentimentality until she falls asleep. Peter gingerly tries to open the trunk, but flees when the boys stir. The Beach Smee, disguised, tries to lure Molly, Prentiss and Ted with a ukulele song. Stache intervenes and tries to bait the kids with poisoned fruitcake, but Molly identifies him and exposes his plot. Smee reveals two prisoners — Mrs. Bumbrake and Alf! Just then, the Mollusks enter with prisoners of their own — Lord Aster and Captain Scott. Mrs. Bumbrake recognizes Fighting Prawn as her long-lost kitchen boy from Brighton. Fighting Prawn proclaims that Betty Bumbrake was the only English person who was kind to him when he was a kitchen slave. Stache pulls his knife on Fighting Prawn and tries to get the trunk from Molly. Molly must decide between saving Fighting Prawn's life and her duty to the Queen. Suddenly, Stache's words are echoed back to him as Peter continues to distract Stache, and challenges him. Peter, Ted, Prentiss, then Molly attack Stache, but are one-by-one outmatched. Stache captures Molly with his razor at her throat. Peter realizes the only way to save Molly is by giving Stache the trunk. Although this means he will never leave the island, he acts selflessly and surrenders it. Stache is impressed by Peter's heroic gesture, realizing that this is the worthy opponent he has been looking for, but lifts the lid to find an empty trunk. The water that seeped into the trunk has dissolved the starstuff and it is now diffused into the ocean. In a fit of frustration, he slams the lid down on his right hand, cutting it off. Delirious from the injury, Stache vows to be Peter's foe for all eternity. Hearing Mr. Grin approaching, the Pirates leave to lure the crocodile to join their crew by feeding it Stache's severed hand. Fighting Prawn honors Peter as a true hero and allows the English to leave, and exits with the Mollusks. Mrs. Bumbrake and Alf settle down happily together, and Captain Scott proclaims his intent to explore Antarctica. Lord Aster makes Molly a full-fledged Starcatcher, and promises her a St. Bernard puppy when they return home. With the starstuff gone, their mission has been fulfilled. Peter mentions his encounter with Teacher to Molly and Lord Aster, and to Molly's horror she and her father realize that Peter cannot leave the island. They realize that Peter, by being dunked in the golden, starstuff-infused waters of the grotto, has been transformed. They share with him the other meaning of Pan: the island and its inhabitants are now his family. Lord Aster captures the yellow bird in the hat, adds the last of the starstuff from his amulet, and turns the bird into a pixie to protect and guide Peter. The fairy flies off, and Ted and Prentiss chase it down the beach. Peter, now the boy who would not grow up, reluctantly bids farewell to the heartbroken Molly with a kiss. As The Wasp sails away, Peter begins to forget what's happened and settles into the eternal present of youth. Years later, the grown-up Molly watches her daughter Wendy fly off with Peter, taking solace in the fact that Peter now has someone to look after him for a time. Prentiss, Ted and the fairy enter; the fairy talks to Peter and suggests that the Lost Boys join him by taking a dip in the waters of the enchanted grotto. As the Lost Boys race down the beach toward the grotto, Peter Pan flies for the first time. Characters *Boy/Peter: A nameless and friendless 13-year-old Orphan, deeply mistrustful of adults and neglected to the point of never having seen the sun. His adventures allow him to find the hero within himself, and to take on a name worthy of the legend he becomes. *Molly Aster: A 13-year-old apprentice Starcatcher desperate to prove herself to her father. Highly intelligent and physically adept, she remains socially awkward and something of a know-it-all, and her relationship with the Orphan Boys is driven as much by competition as it is by friendship. *Black Stache: A highly intelligent but malapropism-prone Pirate chief, so called due to the black mustache that is a trademark in his family. In search of a great hero who he can oppose to become a great villain, Stache is given to scenery- chewing and anachronistic jokes, and has a hook in his future. The name \\"Black Stache\\" is a reference to the pirate Blackbeard. *Smee: Black Stache's faithful first mate. More intelligent than he gives himself credit for (but still not overly bright), Smee is willing to follow his captain in any amount of hare-brained schemes. Somehow, this ends up with him disguising himself as a Mermaid, which is far from a pretty sight. *Lord Leonard Aster: Molly's father, A Starcatcher on a secret mission for Queen Victoria. He loves his daughter dearly but is perhaps guilty of placing his mission above her safety. Constantly paranoid about the security of top-secret conversation, he has trained Molly to converse in Dodo, Porpoise and Norse code (a Morse code-like system used by ancient Vikings.) *Ted: One of the Boy's orphan companions, nicknamed \\"Tubby Ted.\\" Constantly hungry, he is obsessed with food and faints at the mere mention of sticky pudding. He accepts Molly as a mother figure immediately, often referring to her by that title. Once on the Island, he spends most of his time attempting to figure out how to eat a pineapple. *Prentiss: One of the Boy's orphan companions. Pompous and sarcastic, he is intent on proclaiming himself the leader of the gang of Orphans but is too cowardly to really do anything about it, and usually follows Peter and Molly with only nominal protest. *Mrs. Bumbrake: Molly's faithful Nanny, a prim and proper Englishwoman prone to alliteration. In the tradition of the Pantomime dame, the role is written to be portrayed by a male actor, who also plays Teacher a wise and mysterious mermaid. *Alf: A salty and flatulent sailor on the Neverland, who falls deeply and instantly in love with Mrs. Bumbrake. He is somewhat coarse and has no time for children, but good-natured. *Fighting Prawn: The fierce chief of the tribe of Mollusk Islanders, who was sold into slavery in England as a boy, where he became a kitchen slave in a fine house. He speaks almost exclusively in Italian cooking terms. The actor in this role also portrays Grempkin, the sadistic schoolmaster of St. Norbert's Orphanage for Lost Boys, Sanchez, one of Black Stache's crew, and Mack, the world's most incompetent Sailor. *Bill Slank: The nasty, greedy and cruel captain of the Neverland. It is Slank's greed for the Queen's secret treasure sets the entire plot in motion. The actor in the role also portrays Hawking Clam, Fighting Prawn's son. *Captain Robert Falcon Scott: Captain of the Wasp, and Lord Astor's old friend from their schooldays. Based loosely on the real Robert Falcon Scott. The ensemble cast also portrays narrators, mermaids, pirates, sailors, islanders and various other creatures, locations, and people throughout the show.  Productions  The play premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse in California, running from February 13 to March 8, 2009. It was co- directed by playwright Rick Elice's partner Roger Rees and Alex Timbers.

Neverland goes down in Peter and the Starcatcher, it's the most enthralling shipwreck since James Cameron sent the Titanic to her watery grave in the late 1990s . . . The cast is, with no exceptions, wonderful . . . It's a performance that you might classify as over the top, but only in the sense that the entire production is. With grown-up theatrical savvy and a child's wonder at what it can achieve, Peter and the Starcatcher floats right through the ceiling of the physical limits imposed by a three- dimensional stage. While there's not a body harness in sight, like those used to hoist the title characters of Mary Poppins and Spider-Man, this show never stops flying.\\"  Awards and nominations  =Lucille Lortel Awards= Source: broadwayworld.com *Outstanding Play (nominee) *Outstanding Choreographer - Steven Hoggett (winner) *Outstanding Lead Actor - Christian Borle (winner) *Outstanding Scenic Design - Donyale Werle (winner) =Inaugural Off Broadway Alliance Awards= Source: Playbill *Best New Play (nominee) =Drama Desk Awards= Source: PlaybillAndrew, Gans. \\"56th Annual Drama Desk Nominations Announced; Book of Mormon Scores 12 Nominations\\" playbill.com, April 29, 2011. *Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play - Christian Borle (nominee) *Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play - Celia Keenan-Bolger (nominee) *Outstanding Choreography - Steven Hoggett (nominee) *Outstanding Music in a Play - Wayne Barker (winner) *Outstanding Costume Design - Paloma Young (nominee) = Tina Awards = Source: bestofoffbroadway.com *The Best Of Off-Broadway (Play) (nominee) *Best Ensemble (Play) (nominee) *Best Actor (Play) - Christian Borle (nominee) *Best Director - Roger Rees and Alex Timbers (nominee) *Best Choreographer - Steven Hogget (nominee) *Best Scenic Design - Donyale Werle (nominee) *Best Lighting Design - Jeff Croiter (nominee) *Best Sound Design - Darron L.

The Do Not Track header was originally proposed in 2009 by researchers Christopher Soghoian, Sid Stamm, and Dan Kaminsky. Mozilla Firefox became the first browser to implement the feature, while Internet Explorer, Apple's Safari, Opera and Google Chrome all later added support. Efforts to standardize Do Not Track by the W3C in the Tracking Preference Expression (DNT) Working Group reached only the Candidate Recommendation stage and ended in September 2018 due to insufficient deployment and support. DNT is not widely adopted by the industry, with companies citing the lack of legal mandates for its use, as well as unclear standards and guidelines for how websites are to interpret the header. Thus, it is not guaranteed that enabling DNT will actually have any effect at all. The W3C disbanded its DNT working group in January 2019, citing insufficient support and adoption. Apple discontinued support for DNT the following month. In 2020, a coalition of US-based internet companies announced Global Privacy Control header that spiritually succeeds Do Not Track header. The creators hope that this new header will meet the definition of \\"user-enabled global privacy controls\\" defined by California law and European GDPR. In this case, the new header would be automatically strengthened by existing laws and companies would be required to honor it.  Operation  The DNT header accepted three values: \`1\` in case the user does not want to be tracked (opt out), \`0\` in case the user consents to being tracked (opt in), or null (no header sent) if the user has not expressed a preference. The default behavior required by the standard is not to send the header unless the user enables the setting via their browser or their choice is implied by use of that specific browser.  History  In 2007, several consumer advocacy groups asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to create a Do Not Track list for online advertising. The proposal would have required that online advertisers submit their information to the FTC, which would compile a machine-readable list of the domain names used by those companies to place cookies or otherwise track consumers. In July 2009, researchers Christopher Soghoian and Sid Stamm created a prototype add-on for the Firefox web browser, implementing support for the Do Not Track header. Stamm was, at the time, a privacy engineer at Mozilla, while Soghoian soon afterward started working at the FTC. One year later, during a U.S. Senate privacy hearing, FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz told the Senate Commerce Committee that the commission was exploring the idea of proposing a \\"do-not-track\\" list. In December 2010, the FTC issued a privacy report that called for a \\"do not track\\" system that would enable people to avoid having their actions monitored online. One week later, Microsoft announced that its next browser would include support for Tracking Protection Lists, that block tracking of consumers using blacklists supplied by third parties. In January 2011, Mozilla announced that its Firefox browser would soon provide a Do Not Track solution, via a browser header. Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Apple's Safari, Opera and Google Chrome all later added support for the header approach. In August 2015 a coalition of privacy groups led by the Electronic Frontier Foundation using W3C's Tracking Preference Expression (DNT) standard proposed that \\"Do not track\\" be the goal for advocates to demand of businesses. In January 2019, the W3C Tracking Protection Working Group was disbanded, citing \\"insufficient deployment of these extensions\\" and lack of \\"indications of planned support among user agents, third parties, and the ecosystem at large.\\" Beginning the following month, Apple removed DNT support from Safari, citing that it could be used as a \\"fingerprinting variable\\" for tracking. = Internet Explorer 10 default setting controversy = When using the \\"Express\\" settings upon installation, a Do Not Track option is enabled by default for Internet Explorer 10 and Windows 8. Microsoft faced criticism for its decision to enable Do Not Track by default from advertising companies, who say that use of the Do Not Track header should be a choice made by the user and must not be automatically enabled. The companies also said that this decision would violate the Digital Advertising Alliance's agreement with the U.S. government to honor a Do Not Track system, because the coalition said it would only honor such a system if it were not enabled by default by web browsers. A Microsoft spokesperson defended its decision however, stating that users would prefer a web browser that automatically respected their privacy. On September 7, 2012, Roy Fielding, an author of the Do Not Track standard, committed a patch to the source code of the Apache HTTP Server, which would make the server explicitly ignore any use of the Do Not Track header by users of Internet Explorer 10. Fielding argued that Microsoft's decision \\"deliberately violates\\" the Do Not Track specification because it \\"does not protect anyone's privacy unless the recipients believe it was set by a real human being, with a real preference for privacy over personalization\\". The Do Not Track specification did not explicitly mandate that the use of Do Not Track actually be a choice until after the feature was implemented in Internet Explorer 10. Fielding pointed out that Microsoft knew its false signals claiming that users had chosen Do Not Track would be ignored, and that its goal was to effectively give an illusion of privacy while still catering to their own interests. On October 9, 2012, Fielding's patch was commented out, restoring the previous behavior. On April 3, 2015, Microsoft announced that as of Windows 10, it would comply with the specification and no longer enable Do Not Track as part of the operating system's \\"Express\\" default settings, but that the company will \\"provide customers with clear information on how to turn this feature on in the browser settings should they wish to do so\\".  Adoption  Very few companies actually supported DNT, due to a lack of regulatory or voluntary requirements for its use, and unclear standards over how websites should respond to the header. Websites that honor DNT requests include Medium, and Pinterest. Despite supporting it in its Chrome web browser, Google did not implement support for DNT on its websites, and directed users to its online privacy settings and opt-outs for interest-based advertising instead. The Digital Advertising Alliance, Council of Better Business Bureaus and the Direct Marketing Association does not require its members to honor DNT signals. Use of ad blocking software to block web trackers and advertising had become increasingly common (with users citing both privacy concerns and performance impact as justification), while Apple and Mozilla began to add privacy enhancements (such as \\"tracking protection\\") to their browsers, that are designed to reduce undue cross-site tracking. In addition, laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have imposed restrictions on how companies are to store and process personal information. Princeton University associate computer science professor Jonathan Mayer, who was a member of the W3C's working group for DNT, argued that the concept was a \\"failed experiment\\".

The mushroom varies in colours from yellow, red or reddish pink usually. Description Some of the species' notable physical characteristics, however, distinguish it from the other members of the genus. For instance, the colors of the cap, darkening over the disk and the universal veil colored yellow to cream. The other characteristics of the other parts of its body are as follows: * Cap : The cap is convex or sometimes shield-shaped, becoming flat with a fairly distinctly lined margin. The cap may vary in lengths of 2-8 centimeters. The colors include yellow to golden orange or a different combination of scarlet or deep reddish pink. The surface is smooth, becoming slightly sticky when moist. * Stem / Stipe : The stem, also called stipe. The universal veil material is yellow to cream, forming yellow powder or flakes at the base of the stalk. It measures 47 to 62 mm in length and 4 to 11 mm in diameter, also consisting a persistent annulus. * Gills : The gills are free, close, and cream in mass. The short gills are truncate to excavated-truncate and are numerous. * Spores and microscopic features : The spores measure 7.0 to 10.2 µm wide and are globose to subglobose and inamyloid. It has also been noticed that the spores of this mushroom do not turn black in color if iodine is poured on it.  Distribution and habitat  This rare species is normally found in mixed forests with oaks (mostly Quercus oaks) and conifers (mostly Pinaceae conifers). It is considered native to eastern U.S. and southeastern Canada. A specimen of Amanita rubrovolvata. Similar species Amanita frostiana is similar to a range of species, like Amanita rubrovolvata, Amanita flavoconia, Amanita albocreata, Amanita muscaria var. muscaria or simply Amanita muscaria and Amanita subfrostiana. Amanita rubrovolvata is slightly similar physically to this species. The fungus produces small- to medium-sized mushrooms, with reddish-orange caps. Roger Heim reported A. frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but this was probably a misidentification of A. rubrovolvata. Amanita subfrostiana, also referred to as 'False Frost's Amanita', has the same natural habitat as of A. frostiana, but is mostly distributed in southwestern China. It does resemble A. frostiana but due to the different paleness of color in the cap of this species helps avoid misidentification. The distinct and starkly white bulb (e.g., 17 x 15 mm) bears a white or yellow-white collar that is somewhat similar to the collar seen in the exannulate Amanita albocreata, which is a species of the hardwood-hemlock (Tsuga) forest of the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada and of boreal forest at least as far north as the Island of Newfoundland. The clamps present at bases of basidia of this species specially support the presumed relationship to Amanita muscaria var. muscaria or simply Amanita muscaria. Amanita muscaria is a poisonous and psychoactive basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Many misidentifications have taken place while recognizing Amanita flavoconia, one of the most common and widespread species of Amanita in eastern North America, due to various similar physical characteristics. It is mostly confused due to their microscopic features. Edibility The species is considered inedible and poisonous.

According to a legend, once the sage Markandeya asked Lord Narayana to show him a specimen of the divine power. Narayana flooded the entire world for a moment, during which only the Akshayavat could be seen above the water level. According to other stories, Muslim Mughal Emperor Jahangir tried to destroy the tree.  Prayagraj  A tree in Prayagraj has been described as Akshayavat in the Prayag Mahatmya of the Matsya Purana. In The Encyclopaedia Asiatica (1976), Edward Balfour identifies a banyan tree mentioned in Ramayana with the tree at Prayag. Rama, Lakshmana and Sita are said to have rested beneath this tree. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang mentions a tree (a stump with few branches) which was said to be the home of a man-eating demon. As part of a custom, some pilgrims would offer themselves at the nearby temple. Xuanzang mentions that the tree was surrounded with the human bones. Alexander Cunningham identified this tree with the Akshayavat at Prayag. Rishabha (Jain tirthankar) is also said to have practised tapasya beneath the historical Akshayavat at Prayag. Currently, a sacred fig tree located within the Patalpuri Temple at the Allahabad Fort is worshipped as the Akshayavat described in ancient texts. , a permission from the Commandant of Allahabad Fort's Ordnance Depot is needed to visit this tree. On one day during the Kumbh Mela, the site is open to all the pilgrims. However, a popular opinion is that the Patalpuri Temple tree is not the authentic Akshayavat: the real Akshayavat is in another underground temple inside the Fort. When the British gained control of the Allahabad Fort after the Treaty of Allahabad in 1765, they did not want general public to access the sensitive parts of the fort. So, the shrine was moved to fringes of the fort compound, that is, the present-day Patalpuri Temple. According to the Welsh travel writer Fanny Parkes, who visited both the tree sites in 1831, when the original Akshayavat chamber was closed, the local Brahmins set up the stump of a ber tree in Patalpuri. They claimed that it was a branch of the original Akshayavat that had penetrated through the walls. Parkes states that the local Hindus of Prayag knew about this and did not worship the false Akshayavat. An 18th century map of the Fort from the British Library confirms this: the location of the original temple is shown in the center of the fort; while the present-day Patalpuri Temple is on the outskirts of the Fort. In the 1950s, Shiva Nath Katju also claimed that the \\"tree\\" placed in the Patalpuri Temple was only a log that was replaced by the priests every 4–5 years. The commander of the fort acknowledged his claim as true.  Other places  A tree at Kurukshetra, claimed to be the Akshay Vat A tree at Gaya, BiharThe Sacred Complex in Hindu Gaya, Concept. Page 9. and another tree at Varanasi are also worshipped as the Akshayavat. The Bodhi tree is said to be a manifestation of the Akashayavat at Prayag. According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, Buddha is said to have planted a seed of the Prayag's Akshayavat next to Mount Kailash on a mountain known as the Palace of the Medicine Buddha.

It is based on the Ripley's Believe It or Not! franchise. Production and broadcast In March 1994, a pilot for The New Ripley's Believe It or Not had been ordered for ABC. In December 1998, TBS Superstation outbid two broadcast network competitors to purchase the rights from Columbia TriStar Television Distribution for 22 hour-long episodes of The New Ripley's Believe It or Not, to premiere on TBS in January 2000. The series would air weekly, and would be an update of an earlier Ripley's program that aired from 1982 to 1986. The new series was to involve correspondents being sent around the world to report on amazing and unusual subjects. TBS had an option to purchase additional seasons, and had won the rights because it agreed to a full season without seeing a pilot. In June 1999, Erik Nelson was signed on to serve as executive producer for the series. In December 1999, Dean Cain was hired to host the new series. Cain also served as a producer on the show, alongside Dan Jbara. The new series, simply titled Ripley's Believe It or Not!, premiered on TBS on January 12, 2000. The series was primarily shot at a 15,000 square-foot Ripley's warehouse in Sylmar, Los Angeles. Most episodes open with an act that is performed in front of a live audience, while the rest of the episode involves Cain introducing various segments, each one for a different subject. Gregory Jbara served as one of the narrators for the different segments. Kelly Packard became a field correspondent in 2002, and would host coverage of events in which people demonstrate their unusual abilities, usually in front of an audience. The show also features such regular elements as \\"Spot the Not,\\" a weekly trivia segment in which viewers are challenged to pick the claim that is not real and a special \\"Ripley's Record\\" commemoration for people who break a world record while appearing on the show. Reruns of the series began airing on The WB in September 2001, and were expected to continue until December 2001. In early 2003, Sony Pictures Television ordered an 11-episode fourth season. In March 2003, 11 additional episodes were ordered for the fourth season, which aired on Wednesday evenings at 9:00 p.m. For its timeslot, the series was the top-rated program among its target audience of people between the ages of 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54. In September 2003, Sony Pictures announced a trimmed half-hour version of the existing show that would start airing in reruns on local television channels across the United States. Reruns later began airing on Canada's SPACE station as of 2012. As of 2017, hour-long reruns aired on Chiller before the channel ceased operations at year's end.

The park, formerly the private gardens of the nearby Douces Manor was purchased from the manor's owners by Kent County Council in 1973 to be converted into a public open space. The park is legally protected as public recreational land in perpetuity by Fields in Trust as part of the Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge. History This Country park was bought by Kent County Council, in 1973 by using a grant aid from the Countryside Commission. The site covers , part of which was the estate of the nearby 18th Century Manor House. The Grade Listed II building (formerly owned by Thomas Augustus Douce) is opposite the park (across St. Leonard's Street). It was still within the Douce family hands, until 1916, when the manor was bought by the Trustees of Fredrick Andrews to convert it into a convalescent home for ladies. The house was then used in the Second World War to accommodate airmen and was used as the headquarters and Mess for officers flying from the nearby RAF West Malling Airfield. Inside the Georgian wine cellar (of the house), 'the Twitch Inn' was established. This was so named because of all the nervous tics caused by constantly looking out for enemy aircraft, of the pilots. Names of the pilots are still etched on the walls of the cellar. Many famous air aces have frequented Douces Manor, including Sailor Malan, Stanford Tuck, Guy Gibson (a Dambusters pilot) and Wing Commander John ‘Cats Eyes’ Cunningham (a top RAF night-flight pilot) with his navigator Jimmy Rawnsley. The Twitch Inn is now designated as a Heritage Centre by the Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council and is let to the Parish Council on a peppercorn rent for 125 years. The centre opens up to 20 times a year and displays artefacts currently in the possession of the Malling Society, including Guy Gibson's uniform. Beechcroft Developments (current owners of Douces Manor) donated up to £5,000 to get the fund-raising for the heritage centre. Douce's Manor - Former Manor House Description The park is divided into four main sections;- the Lake, Douce's Meadow, Ice House Field, Abbey Field and Chestnut Paddocks. *The Lake - a large body of water, running the length of St.Leonards Road. Thomas Douce made many alterations to the estate during his ownership, including pushing the lake further into the Parkland away from the house and making a new road beside the lake and the old St Leonards Street became his front and back drive to the manor house. This meant a lot of landscaping works were carried out. In the mid-1920s the lake froze over and was used for ice skating. The lake and its surrounding woodland are a haven for water wildlife, including Mallard ducks, coots, swans and moorhens. In summer, Martins and swallows visit the lake. *Douce's Meadow - Large parkland meadow, in the past it had wide open views across towards the house and West Malling Church. *Ice House Field - a smaller meadow (across the lake) that takes its name from the site of a former ice house. The sunken brick constructed chamber, with a concrete floor, would have been used to store ice taken from the lake in winter for use in the Manor House kitchen throughout the year. During the Second World War, the field on which the ice house is situated was used as a prison camp for interned Germans. It was capped in 1963 on health and safety grounds and then concealed under an earth mound. It is No.40 on a list of 64 known ice houses in Kent, according to English Heritage. The meadow around it, has many meadow plants growing within it including Dog Daisies, buttercups and the (uncommon) Hay Rattle. This small plant has yellow flowers, whose ripe seeds rattle in the plant - when dry. *Abbey Field and Chestnut Paddocks - two larger fields (to the west of the estate) used mainly for grazing cattle during various parts of the year, helping promote further wildlife and plant life diversity within the park. Chestnut Paddocks takes its name from a large group of ancient Sweet Chestnut trees growing near the middle of the field. Adjacent to the country park is St Leonard's Tower. The country park has previously hosted a Kent Big Weekend Event. Two public footpaths lead through the park. Ref No's MR141 and MR142. As well as various other trails within the park and around the lake. St. Leonard's Tower The park also is accredited with a Green Flag Award by Natural England.

A former deer park of a large estate, it was later sold to become an open-space and woodland park. The park and Lullingstone Castle are a Scheduled Monument, and an area of is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest Kent. History This 460 acre country park is between Eynsford and Shoreham; it was formerly a medieval deer park, and part of the estate and Manor of Lullingstone, which was mentioned in the Domesday Survey. In 1934, much of the park was sold to Kemp Town Brewery, Brighton who later sold it to Kent County Council in 1938. In 1944, during the 2nd World War, a decoy airfield was sited in the park, and Lullingstone Castle was used by the army. The Lullingstone estate was also hit by various German bombs; most craters have been covered up. One crater is now hidden by trees. In the mid-1960s, Kent County Council leased the park to Dartford Rural District Council, who created an 18-hole golf course in the park. Later in the 20th Century, a 9-hole course was also added. This still occupies the western and central section of the park. The park is currently leased by Sevenoaks District Council, but the park is maintained by Kent County Council. Lullingstone Castle and its grounds remain in private ownership under the Hart-Dykes. In 1964, Summerhouse Knoll (a grass hill) within the park was dug up by Crayford Archaeological Research Group who found 1st Century pottery. Some of the pollards in the wood are over 400 years old, and it is important for invertebrates, lichens, breeding birds and fungi. Over 340 beetle species have been recorded, including two which are nationally rare. Geography Lullingstone Country Park Information Board The park is well renowned for its collection of ancient trees within the park. These include 300 veteran oaks, beeches, hornbeams, ash (Fraxinus), and sweet chestnut trees. These include specimens estimated to be around 500 years old. As well as the woodlands, the park has large meadow land areas, with plentiful species of plants within, including orchids and other native wildflowers and butterflies. The River Darent flows through the eastern valley section of the park, alongside the Darent Valley Path (long distance path). Sections of the river are widened to create lakes and ponds. These also attract wildlife including, kingfishers, herons, grass snakes, dragonflies and damselflies. Several marked trails exist within the park. The White Woodland Walk is a 2-mile heading through Beechen Wood and past the Orchid Bank. The Black Lullingstone Loop is a 4-mile perimeter walk, via Beechen Wood (a Site of Special Scientific Interest), passing Lullingstone Roman Villa, Lullingstone Castle. It passes many of the ancient trees in the park. The Red Discovery Trail is a 1.5-mile child-friendly activity trail. The Blue Horse Trail is 4 miles. Other footpaths including public footpaths also exist within the park. The country park held a Kent Big Weekend Event during March 2011 in the grounds of the Country Park. The park also is accredited with a Green Flag Award by Natural England. See also Lullingstone Castle Nearby, is the 15th-century Lullingstone Castle and Tom Hart Dyke's World of Garden Plants. Also, within 1 mile of the country park is another less visited Park and woodland of Preston Hill Country Park. How to get there From Eynsford, follow the A225 towards Otford.

It is located on the Greensand Ridge, close to Ide Hill village. The site is owned and managed by Sundridge with Ide Hill Parish Council. History In 1769, it was part of Whitley Forest, which has remained largely intact due to the varied geology and poor soil types on the Greensand escarpment, which are unsuitable for intensive farming. The forest is a Site of Special Scientific Interest as part of the larger Scords Wood and Brockhoult Mount area (which includes Toys Hill). The ancient forest is home to some plants that are scarce in Kent. The forest suffered badly in the Great Storm of 1987. Replanting was partly funded by the Ide Hill Society with monies given to the National Trust and Kent County Council. Some huge ancient oak and beech trees survived the gales. Holly, whitebeam, ash, chestnut, hazel and rowan trees are present. Bluebells carpet the ground in the spring. Ownership On April 4, 2014 Stubbs Wood was put up for sale by Kent County Council, which announced a three-week consultation period. With the intention of keeping public ownership of the woods, a campaign was started. The woodland, which is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and also part of the Green Belt, has a number of restrictive covenants which limit its potential future use, it also includes a network of public footpaths, which needed to be retained. Sundridge with Ide Hill Parish Council took over the ownership and management of the site in 2015. Hanging Bank Hanging Bank Information Board A part of the forest near to Ide Hill is known as Hanging Bank. On 28 January 1554, during Wyatt's rebellion against Queen Mary, a rebel force of about 500 men led by Henry Isley clashed with a similar-sized loyal force led by Lord Abergavenny and Sir Robert Southwell, at Wrotham Hill. After a running battle over about , the rebels made their last stand at Hartley Wood, where they were defeated. A gallows was set up in the wood and many people were hanged. Lady Amherst's Drive Sarah Amherst was the first wife of William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst, who was Governor-General of India from 1823 to 1828. Born William Pitt Amherst, he inherited the Montreal estate on the outskirts of nearby Sevenoaks from his great uncle Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, who commanded the British forces in Canada who took Quebec (under General Wolfe) and Montreal – hence the name of his estate. While the estate house was long ago demolished, Wolf’s own Quebec House in nearby Westerham is now under the management of the National Trust. The Amhersts were responsible for introducing the Asian game bird known as Lady Amherst's pheasant to Bedfordshire. Lady Amherst was fond of a drive along the Greensand Ridge through Stubbs Wood with its panoramic views of Kent. The drive follows the line of the ancient road, the route from Bessels Green (near Sevenoaks) and Sundridge leading through Whitley Forest to Ide Hill. In the late 18th century, this track was re-routed via Goathurst Common and made into a road. Stubbs Wood Track Greensand Way Lady Amherst's Drive (now a track) remains as the footpath through Stubbs Wood from Sevenoaks Weald to Ide Hill. Walk 6 in Walking in Kent (Ide Hill to Manor Farm and then back to Ide Hill) follows the route through the wood. Parts of the forest are accessible via horseback and bicycle on the public bridleways. Some of the paths at the top of the greensand ridge are suitable for people with walking difficulties, but others (near the Hanging Bank) are very steep.

Three of the farmhouse occupants were killed and 8 others were injured, later the ruined farmhouse was demolished. The site was then used as a Ministry of Defence firing range (up to the 1940s); the remnants of the range can still be seen. Since 1951 it has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest (part of Otford To Shoreham Downs site). Preston Hill has extensive views across the countryside from the Darenth Valley (following the River Darent) to Lullingstone Country Park. The site has of chalk grassland and woodland with many wild flowers and rare butterflies at this site of outstanding natural beauty located within the Kent Downs. On the grasslands, a variety of butterflies including chalkhill blues and dark green fritillaries can be seen. Since the site is relatively quiet, common adders and grass snakes can also be found. The grassland is grazed occasionally by a herd of feral goats, which came from the Great Orme, near Colwyn Bay in North Wales.These are used to further encourage the growth of wildflowers.

At nearly eight minutes long, it is the band's longest song. It has received critical acclaim since its release, often cited as the crowning point of both the album and the band's career by critics, fans, and the band members themselves. In March 2011, Guitarist magazine listed the song's guitar solo, which is performed by both Myles Kennedy and Mark Tremonti, as the greatest guitar solo of all time. Background \\"Blackbird\\" appears as the eighth track on Alter Bridge's 2007 album of the same name. It was composed and arranged by Alter Bridge, and the lyrics were written by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Myles Kennedy, who said that the creation of the song was difficult and that it took a long time. \\"We beat our heads against the wall for months,\\" he told TuneLab, \\"so when it finally came together it was a good moment.\\" He also said that he feels that \\"Blackbird\\" is one of the most gratifying songs that the band has ever written. The song is inspired by Kennedy's friend Mark Morse, who died as the song was being written: Kennedy explained that the idea for the chorus of the song came from an experience in the recording studio: A live version of the song appears on the band's 2009 concert film Live from Amsterdam. The opening guitar piece of The Beatles' song of the same name is performed by Kennedy as an introduction for the song. Reception and recognition Reception towards \\"Blackbird\\" has been extremely positive since its release. Vik Bansal from musicOMH referred to \\"Blackbird\\" as the album's pièce de résistance and stated, \\"An eight-minute paean to a lost loved one, it never comes close to sounding mawkish and instead counterpoints an ascendant tune with doomy, emotionally-charged riffs that somehow create a general sense of uplifting.\\" In their review for the album, Ultimate Guitar Archive said that the song \\"starts out like any other rock ballad you might hear, but by the end you’ve been taken in every which direction.\\" Sharon Mawer of Allmusic said, \\"It was on the title track with eight minutes of powerful emotions at work that the band really shone, the song alternating between a hard rock guitar riff-heavy number and an acoustic ballad about the loss of a loved one.\\" In addition to being a fan favorite, the members of the band have also cited the song as their favorite. Kennedy said in an interview with Hardrock Haven that he feels that the song is one of his top five musical achievements. When asked about the song in an interview with Rob Laing from MusicRadar, Kennedy said, \\"That was a really special song, I'll never forget how it felt when we'd completed that. We tapped into something that doesn't come along on every record, that's for sure. We were really happy that the people who support us really embraced it as well.\\" In February 2011, Guitarist named the song's two back-to-back guitar solos, which are respectively played by vocalist and guitarist Myles Kennedy and lead guitarist Mark Tremonti, as collectively the greatest guitar solo of all time. In a poll allowing readers to vote, the song won and defeated performances by famous rock guitarists such as Slash, Eddie Van Halen, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, John Petrucci, Steve Vai, and David Gilmour by a wide margin.

Background The modern jury trial was first introduced in the Rhenish provinces in 1798, with a court consisting most commonly of 12 citizens ('). A Swabian ordinance of 1562 had also called for the summons of jurymen ('), and various methods were in use in Emmendingen, Oppenau, and Oberkirch. Hauenstein's charter of 1442 secured the right to be tried in all cases by 24 fellow equals, and in Friburg the jury was composed of 30 citizens and councilors. In Constance the jury trial was suppressed by decree of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1786. The Frankfurt Constitution of the failed Revolutions of 1848 called for jury trials for \\"the more serious crimes and all political offenses\\" but was never implemented. Germany's system whereby citizens were tried by their peers chosen from the entire community in open court was gradually superseded by a system of professional judges, in which the process of investigation was more or less confidential and judgements were issued by judges appointed by the state. There was an 1873 proposal by the Prussian Ministry of Justice to abolish the jury and replace it with the mixed system. The jury system was implemented in the German Empire by the Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz (GVG) of 27 January 1877 with the jury court (') consisting of 3 judges and 12 jurymen. The Weimar Republic was created in 1919, when German Empire Chancellor Friedrich Ebert signed the Weimar Constitution into law on 11 August 1919. On 11 January 1923, the Belgian and French Army initiated the Occupation of the Ruhr that would last until 25 August 1925, in response to the failure of the Weimar Republic to pay the World War I reparations in the aftermath of World War I. In May 1923, Justice Minister Rudolf Heinze (DVP) under Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno attempted to replace the jury system with large lay judge (') courts but was defeated in the Reichstag. An Article 48 (of the Weimar Constitution) state of emergency was proclaimed by President Ebert on 26 or 27 September 1923, lasting until February 1924, in tandem with the announcement by Chancellor Gustav Stresemann of the end to the resistance against the Occupation of the Ruhr. Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic would reach its peak in November 1923. On 8 December 1923, the Reichstag passed an enabling act (') empowering the government to take all measures it deemed necessary and urgent, with regard to the state of emergency, lasting until 15 February 1924. Acts passed pursuant to Article 48 emergencies and their enabling acts are referred to as ', or emergency decrees. Abolition On 4 January 1924, Justice Minister Erich Emminger (BVP) under Chancellor Wilhelm Marx (Centre Party) issued the ' (Emminger Reform), which abolished juries in the ', replacing them with a mixed system of three professional judges and six lay judges, but kept the original name. The reform was presented as an emergency, money-saving measure in a period of acute financial stringency. Although a special meeting of the German Bar (') demanded the revocation of the decrees, and the Social Democrats called the reform a flagrant usurpation of the clearly expressed wishes of the Reichstag, the decrees did not cause much commotion. Aftermath The use of lay judges was completely eliminated on the first day of World War II, with the exception of the infamous People's Court. The jury system has never been reintroduced in Germany, but between 1948 and 1950, prior to the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany, Bavaria returned to jury trial, as it had existed before the Emminger Decrees. In 1974 the number of lay judges in the ' was further reduced from six to two.

The company was founded in Brussels in 1998 by InBev and now is part of the Anheuser-Busch InBev Group. Currently, Belgian Beer Cafés can be found in 50 cities spread out over 19 countries. History The Belgian Beer Café concept pairs Belgian beers with Belgian cuisine. The Cafés were designed by Creneau International, inspired by the look of Belgian Cafés during the interbellum and incorporating many elements of Belgian Art Nouveau architect Victor Horta. Belgian Beer Cafés come in two slightly different concepts: rural and cosmopolitan. The rural version imitates the typical Belgian brasserie, which is rather spacious with a large amount of seating and a good view of the comings and goings. The cosmopolitan- orientated Cafés are furnished in a more efficient way, less roomy and are targeted to a different audience. At first, the beer menu was limited to only original InBev brands but over the years the number of participating breweries has grown. At the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China, a complete Belgian Beer Café was constructed in the Belgian EU pavilion, drawing some 110,000 visitors. The Belgian Beer Cafés were also represented in 2011 at the Cleveland Wine Festival.Cleveland Wine Festival During the festival, a Belgian Beer Café served Stella Artois (premium lager), Hoegaarden (white wheat beer) and Leffe (abbey beer). International expansion As of 2011, Belgian Beer Café locations can be found in 51 cities spread out over 20 countries and 4 continents (Europe, Asia, North America and Australia). Most of the cafes are located in city centres, but the Cafés can also be found in hotels and at international airports. {  Dubai  Sydney  Prague  Utrecht } References External links Belgian Beer Café U.S. Companies based in Leuven ","title":"Belgian Beer Café"},{"id":"31191289","text":"Roger M. Milgrim (born March 22, 1937 in New York City) is an intellectual property lawyer, and the author of two multivolume law treatises: Milgrim on Trade Secrets and Milgrim on Licensing. Milgrim on Trade Secrets was originally published in 1967 and is updated three times each year; its 124th edition, published in 2020, comprises five volumes. Milgrim on Licensing was first published in 1990 and is updated twice annually; its 51st update, published in 2019, comprises four volumes. These two treatises began being updated in 2007 by Milgrim and Eric E. Bensen, of the New York Bar. Both treatises are companions to other major intellectual property treatises in the LexisNexis IP series, which includes Chisum on Patents and Nimmer on Copyright. The two treatises have been cited by the U.S. Supreme Court and other courts, and the treatise on Trade Secrets has been cited by the appellate and/or district courts in virtually every federal circuit and by state courts in virtually every state. In late 2012, Milgrim's Guide to IP Licensing was published by Wolters Kluwer.  Education  In 1954, Milgrim graduated from Central High School in Philadelphia, where he earned a B.A. degree. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree (B.A.) from the University of Pennsylvania in 1958. As a Root-Tilden Scholar he received an LL.B. and later an LL.M. from the New York University School of Law.

History This genus was described in 1990 by Petit et al. The type species is Hemolivia stellata. Molecular data on H. stellata were provided in 2015 by Karadjian, Chavatte and Landau, from a 25-year-old archived smear of crushed tick (Amblyomma rotondatum). Hepatozoon argantis Garnham, 1954 was reassigned to Hemolivia as Hemolivia argantis (Garnham, 1954) Karadjian, Chavatte and Landau, 2015. Characteristics of the genus The species in this genus are haemogregarines and infect exothermic vertebrates. They have erythrocytic gamogony, both erythrocytic and extra-erythrocytic merogony and cystogony. The definitive hosts are ixodid ticks. Sporogony occurs in two phases. In the first phase conjugation and fertilization occur within the tick gut. This is followed by the formation of oocysts and the generation of sporokinetes. In the second phase the sporokinetes invade the body of the tick and give rise to sporocysts containing sporozoites infective to the vertebrate host. Life cycle The vertebrate host of this species is the cane toad (Bufo marinus). The invertebrate host is the tick Amblyomma rotondatum. Toads become infected by ingesting infected ticks. The sporozoites are released from the sporocysts within the tick and penetrate the intestinal wall. Within the toad they replicate within the endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Liver cysts may form. Circulating gamonts are then ingested by a tick. Within the tick gut the gamonts form pairs and penetrate the epithelial cells. Within these cells they associate in syzygy. Gametes are formed and fuse forming an oocyst. The oocysts are star shaped. The oocyst undergoes meiosis and then mitosis producing numerous sporozoites. These sporozoites invade the body of the tick, undergo merogony and giving rise to many merozoites which are infective for the toad.

Santa Aurea The Basilica of Santa Aurea is a church situated in the Ostia Antica district of Ostia, Italy. Ostia became an episcopal see as early as the 3rd century AD. The present-day church, completed in 1483, it was the seat of the suburbicarian diocese of Ostia until 1966, when Ostia became part of the diocese of Rome. History The church was built at the end of the 15th century by order of the French cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville, and was completed by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (the future Pope Julius II). The actual construction was entrusted to Baccio Pontelli, who had also built the neighboring fortress. It is uncertain whether the church was built over a pre-existing Paleochristian church, but according to tradition, the patron saint of Ostia, the martyr Saint Aurea, was buried near the present-day location of the church. According to tradition, the relics of Saint Monica, mother of Augustine of Hippo, rested at this early church of Santa Aurea before being translated to Rome to the church of San Trifone in Posterula and finally to the Basilica di Sant'Agostino. The relics of St. Asterius of Ostia are enshrined at Santa Aurea.Sabine Baring-Gould, The Lives of the Saints. Vol. 2. (J. Hodges, 1877). Digitized June 6, 2007. Page 506. Description The inside of the basilica contains a single nave, and the church is illuminated by a rose window and double lancet windows dating from the 15th century. The church contains a chapel dedicated to Saint Monica, which contains a sepulchral stone re- discovered in the summer of 1945 that contains a funerary epigraph written by Anicius Bassus. The fragment was discovered after two boys were digging a hole to plant a football post in the courtyard beside Santa Aurea.Peter Brown, Augustine of Hippo: A Biography, Revised Edition with a New Epilogue (University of California Press, 2000), 124. The chapel contains a painting by Pietro da Cortona called the Ecstasy of Saint Monica (Estasi di santa Monica). The apse is dedicated with frescoes of the 16th century.

Article in Wall Street Journal, 8 December 2009 \\"Journalism and Freedom\\" was adapted from a speech given by Murdoch (Chairman and CEO of News Corporation) at the Federal Trade Commission's Workshop on Journalism and the Internet, held on 1 December 2009. In this article Murdoch discusses his views on government involvement in the press in the form of subsidies, the outdated \\"20th century business models\\" of newspapers which rely on advertising revenues and the detrimental effects these have on creators of established news content and the newspaper industry as a whole. He also argues that government funding compromises independent journalism and is a greater threat to competitive and unbiased press than digital technologies are. Also discussed is the impact of internet search engines and open content news material available online and new methods and models of content delivery portal electronic devices and media (e-readers, smart phones, laptops) and how this will affect delivery of news content in the future. The debate surrounding \\"Journalism and Freedom\\" has focused on the threat of new technologies, and the role that they play in the decline of traditional newspapers. Murdoch does not blame new technologies for the decline of newspapers, rather the lack of regulation which allows journalists content to be used without payment. He sees the opportunities technologies can bring, creating a much wider audience for newspapers. Opinions have also been voiced concerning government interventions and the suitability of these as a way of rescuing the industry. Other revenue and business models have been proposed as an alternative to existing ones, as traditional models are failing. Decline of the industry A report in 2009 highlighted the decline of newspaper circulation as figures showed that the industry as a whole sold fewer newspapers than at any other time since the 1940s.Perez-Pena, R. \\"U.S. Newspaper Circulation falls 10%\\", New York Times, 26 October 2009 Within the report, free online content and business models were blamed for their part in the downturn; an opinion in agreement with Murdoch's article. The Wall Street Journal's circulation in 2009 defied the trend as their circulation rose 0.6% and in 2010 they topped the list of circulating figures for American newspapers . The Journal sells online subscriptions, which is seen as a reason for their success. Revenue models Traditional print based media relies heavily upon advertisements and classified adverts for the generation of the majority of their revenue, which accounts for upwards of three quarters of total income.Mensing, D. 'Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996' , Newspaper Research Journal Spring, 2007 This subsidy covers the expensive printing and distribution costs of the publication which was estimated to be between 30-40% and 11% respectively of total operating costs in 2006.Ahlers, D.\\"News Consumption and the New Electronic Media\\" Harvard International Journal of Press & Politics 2006 Although online advertisements revenue have overtaken their print counterparts recently, the vast majority of this is spent on search engines and pay-per-click content rather than more traditional advertising on news websites such as banners.BBC News \\"Online Advertising 'Overtakes TV'\\" BBC Business News 30 September 2009 Users do not appear willing to pay for general digital news content. Publications such as the New York Times have launched premium subscription based content TimeSelect in the past but uptake was low and it was eventually removed, but this is not to say that users will never pay for content, yet as of now it has not been successful for a mainstream publication as a method of generating revenue. James Jarvis, an American journalist, stated that \\"TimesSelect is dead...with it goes any hope of charging for content online, Content is now and forever free\\".Jarvis, J. \\" Times deselected\\" BuzzMachine 17 September 2007 One reason for this is that there is an abundance of free sources online for news, therefore few users will feel the need to pay for content that is available without charge elsewhere. Murdoch states that it is his belief that users in the future will indeed be willing to pay for digital news if the content is worthy, which is evident in the recent launch of The Daily, an iPad-only daily newspaper which sells at 99 cents (US) per week.BBC News \\"News Corp launches daily newspaper for iPad\\" BBC Technology News 2 February 2011 In the UK, The Times newspaper (also owned by Murdoch) saw its readership decline by 90% in 2010 after it introduced a paywall.Halliday, J. Guardian 20 July 2010 In response to Murdoch's article, Kathy Gill claims that customers will not pay for content that is available elsewhere for free and that there needs to be a distinction made between what they will and won't pay for. There are also claims of hypocrisy in what Murdoch says as The Wall Street Journal has been criticised for not providing links to competitors in their own articles.Gill, K.E. Rupert Murdoch: Journalism and Freedon – A Rebuttal’’, 8 December 2009 Attracting readers The globalisation of media and the new formats available are seen by Murdoch as an opportunity and the increased competition created good for consumers. People no longer want to be restricted by one format so newspapers must adapt their delivery models. Murdoch states that the customer base newspapers already have is an advantage as they can attract readers equally to their online versions. The standard of journalism is also likely to be more professional. Murdoch's vision of the future for newspapers online is that if readers are targeted and the content offered is of a high quality, people will be willing to pay for it. Technology As Murdoch states, readers use different technology platforms to access news content. Portable devices with considerably better processors, such as smartphones, laptops and tablet PCs which has made the gathering and dissemination of information much easier and increased the connection possibilities of news content which can be accessed by a larger number of people. Availability of news has now become considerabley more selective and flexible in terms of where it can be accessed. This means that it is likely that those who seek online news will consume more news in general as those who purchase the physical copy of the newspaper will be more and not less likely to access the same publications website.Nguyen, A, \\"The complementary relationship between the Internet and traditional mass media: the case of online news and information\\", Information research, 3 April 2006 Murdoch states that adherence to business models based upon advertising on the part of news papers is responsible for declining revenues. Additionally, those who consume a lot of news offline will access online news more frequently. This, he argues, means that journalists and readers alike have perhaps been able to research more thoroughly using search engines, stumbling serendipitously upon sources online which they may not have encountered in an analogue environment.Downie, L, \\"The Reconstruction of American Journalism\\" , 20 October 2009 This has given rise to new challenges for media organisations in terms of delivering content to users. . It is debatable whether online and offline news content are competing or complementary products. Some argue that the Internet presents too much competition for traditional newspapers.Farhi, P. Don't Blame the Journalism October 2008 In terms of trust, there is also an assumption that news content delivered online may be inferior to content delivered by newspapers.de Waal, E, \\"Online Newspapers: A Substitute or Complement for Print Newspapers and Other Information Channels?\\" , Communications: the European Journal of Communication Research, 2005 However, there is also the issue of users finding online content less trust worthy. This could be linked to it being free and assumption that online news content is possibly less likeable, satisfying and enjoyable. However, as the article discuss, technology is not necessarily the cause of the decline in revenues from traditional news paper formats. Others. like Google CEO Eric Schmidt say that technology is definitely not to blame and can actually help newspapers to progress and avoid decline.Johnson, B. \\"Newspapers must keep innovating, says Google chief Eric Schmidt\\" 8 April 2009 Obsolescence of single delivery format is unlikely as both print and online serve different purposes and audiences. Content creators and aggregators Murdoch also attacks news aggregator services, which he sees as being parasitic in that they are benefiting from news which they have not created or contributed to in any way. This refers to news websites who gather content for users, which allow them to access news stories on multiple sources, often on one specified area or topic of interest in order to save them time and effort but also blogs and even websites such as Yahoo! News and MSN. He comments that this it is particularly unfair to edit and rewrite articles that journalists have invested their time and effort in, especially in cases when they are not cited as being the original author or plagiarised. He challenges that this kind of behaviour constitutes fair use and that those who do not contribute or create the news content that they publish on their websites or blogs can profit from the efforts of the aforementioned journalist while adding very little themselves. Also that this current practice cannot continue indefinitely. Murdoch's statements were attacked by Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington stating that \\"Murdoch confused aggregation with wholesale misappropriation\\". She argued that aggregation was not misappropriation and that most journalists liked the traffic consequently driven to them. Also, Murdoch's own companies were as guilty for aggregating content like the political tracker on Fox News.com and the Rotten Tomatoes web site.Albanesius, C. Murdoch, Huffington Squabble Over Online News 1 December 2009 Government intervention Rupert Murdoch, 12 January 2009 The level of financial support for newspapers from the American Government is decreasing and some believe this is a factor in the decline of the traditional newspaper industry. One instance of where governments have withdrawn from the industry came with the rise of e-government, bringing about less of a need for local authorities to pay for advertising space in newspapers. There is a debate between those who are calling for more government funding to support the industry and others who believe this would be contrary to free speech and create unfair competition.Lipsky, S. All the news that's fit to subsidise, 21 October 2009 Similar examinations are occurring in other countriesWaters, C. European Media Subsidies, 23 February 2010 as countries like Austria, France Norway and Sweden are looking to change their current subsidy models. It is possible for news organisations to receive public money and still maintain neutrality, most notably, the BBC. Tension also exists between direct subsidies like help with printing, distribution, research, and training, and indirect subsidies like tax concessions. Indirect subsidies are a more common model of government intervention. Changes in government legislation is seen as another option. The example of the U.S. auto industry has been brought up to demonstrate that the newspaper industry needs more than financing to survive. Murdoch asserts that newspapers themselves need to look at new ways of surviving, competing and generating revenue as government financing merely \\"props up those who are producing things that customers do not want\\". As Murdoch suggests, new business models need to be created and the industry – along with government - needs to be more proactive. Better legislation concerning newspapers and for the protection of newspapers is, says Murdoch, the best way to ensure the future of quality journalism. Legislation was introduced in 2009 by senator Ben Cardin of Maryland to help struggling newspapers. Under section 501(c) of the U.S. tax code, newspapers could become nonprofits and thus benefit from tax breaks similar to those awarded to charities, and educational and cultural nonprofits. So far, the bill has not progressed in Congress and it is questioned whether newspapers with existing debt would be able to be saved by this.Ferraro, T. U.S. bill seeks to rescue faltering newspapers, 24 March 2009 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is also looking into protecting newspapers through policy. New ways of generating revenue, greater protection of intellectual property (an area Murdoch expresses concern about), a redefining of \\"fair use\\", and potential areas of government intervention are discussed in the FTC's Potential Policy Recommendations to support the reinvention of Journalism.Federal Trade Commission Potential Policy Recommendations to Support the Reinvention of Journalism - Discussion Draft , 2009 There is also a case for no intervention at all, and that newspapers must find their own way. If this results in some of them ceasing to exist, this is merely the reflection of the market. It may also encourage newspapers to find their own way of dealing with the downturn, perhaps through greater emphasis on collaboration with each other.Downie, L. and Schudson, M. The reconstruction of American Journalism, 19 October 2009 Murdoch's article calls for the government to reassess its regulation of news corporation ownership and copyright legislation. He believes that the governments role should be to protect the intellectual property of the newspapers and their journalists, get rid of regulations which hinder investment, and not restrict Cross ownership in the media.

It was established in 1918 as a harrow manufacturing company, and its product line has expanded since. Currently, AGCO Feucht has the industry's largest product range of mowers, tedders and rakes. The machines are a vibrant red color with safety tarps in a bright yellow color. The logo is also a vibrant red square with a white circle inside which states Fella in bold black letters. The Fella slogan is ‘Harvesting Energy’.Fella portrait History of the name The origin of the name Fella is not entirely clear, however, the common belief is that it was derived from the Egyptian word fellah meaning farmer or peasant. The ‘fallahin’ (plural) were used by pharaohs in ancient Egypt to create their pyramids. They still exist in Egypt today and are the lowest social class. They are in a constant struggle to increase their social standing. This is believed to be a link between Fella and the journey to become one of the leading agricultural and forage harvesting companies. History Self- propelled combine harvester Jupiter (1960) In 1917, Josef Hackl and Albert Löffler came up with the idea to create a harrow manufacturing company. World War I would soon be over and there would undoubtedly be an increase in farm equipment demand and sales and metal working production. Hackl and Löffler wanted to take advantage of this business opportunity. They also benefited by being involved in Isaria-ZählerwerkeRadio Museum (a company that produced radios and was later purchased by Siemens). Isaria-ZählerwerkeIsaria Zählerwerke is a very important part of the history of Fella. The Board members of Isaria-Zählerwerke, which included Hackl, decided to undertake the Bayerische Harzprodukte-Fabrik GmbH, a company that produced wood products. This company leased out their land to the furniture company Karl Beer. That land also became important in the future of Fella-Werke. When Josef Hackl brought his idea to the Board members of Isaria-Zählerwerke and the Bayerische Harzprodukte-Fabrik GmbH, they thought it could work and decided to undertake it. They decided to give the Bayerische Eggenfabrik AG (later to be known as Fella-Werke GmbH) a beginning share capital of 300,000 German Marks to set up the new company. The general thought was that after World War I there would be an increase in the demand of metal work. This demand could not be satisfied by the Munich-based Isaria-Zählerwerke alone. Löffler left Isaria-Zählerwerke on 31 December 1917 and on 1 January 1918 he became Managing Director of the Bayerische Eggenfabrik AG in Feucht, Germany. The formal founding of the company took place on February 9, 1918 simultaneously while acquiring the land from the furniture company Karl Beer. The plot was approximately and was acquired for 168,000 German marks. Under the leadership of Löffler, what is now known as Fella-Werke GmbH began as a harrow production company. It did not take long before Fella started acquiring other companies, however. In 1923, Fella acquired a loader wagon company and in 1924 they added the production of ploughs to their line. In 1931, Fella took over Epple & Buxmann in Augsburg. This was a crucial step in their harvesting technology. In that acquisition, Fella began their first production of mowers, tedders and rakes mainly for grain production.Fella timeline In 1954, there was the introduction of Jupiter, a self-propelled combine harvester. This harvester was very modern and advanced for the time, being able to work through not only one, but many different types of grain. In 1966, Fella added yet another product to their line: silos.Fella history In the 1980s and 1990s Fella really began to focus on their forage product range. They kept a large product range, but focused on advancing in the forage harvesting industry. Fella has still been making technical innovations in the field with the world’s largest mounted disc mower (working width: ), the and 42.65-foot (13 m) tedders, and the TS 40000 rake. Present AGCO Feucht GmbH is still located in Feucht, Germany. The present product range is focused on forage harvest implements: mowers, tedders, and rakes. AGCO Feucht is still known for having the largest forage harvesting product range,FELLA Product Range as well as professional sized machinery. Management AGCO Feucht also went through many management changes; in 1988 there was a management buy-out where Peter Timmermann became the managing director and in 1999 Timmermann sold the company to a Dutch investing group (Netagco) who invested heavily in Fella. Netagco invested specifically in upgrading the old buildings as well as building a new assembly hall and a more modern office building.Profi.de In 2004, Fella was acquired by ARGO, who decided that their subsidiary company, Laverda, would become the parent company of Fella.ARGO SpA History In 2007, it became necessary for ARGO to sell 50% of Laverda. They sold that 50% to AGCO and in late 2010 AGCO announced its intentions to buy the remaining shares of Laverda, thereby purchasing Fella-Werke GmbH as well. This purchase was finalized in March 2011.CPM-magazine.co.uk Current machinery range Fendt tractor with Fella mowers AGCO Feucht currently offers drum mowers, disc mowers, mowers, tedders and rakes including conditioners and other attachments. The drum mowers come from 5.41 ft (1.65 m) to 10.04 ft (3.06 m) for a single mower. Disc mowers, on the other hand, come with a working width of 5.45 ft (1.66 m) up to 30.51 ft (9.30 m). These come with several different options; tine or roller conditioners as well as a conveyor belt to form a swath immediately after mowing. Currently, Fella has the largest tedder on the market; the TH 1800 Hydro is a tedder. There are also small attachments for alpine tractors, TH 400 DS Hydro, which is 13.12 ft (4.00 m). Rakes include an 11.15 ft (3.40 m) TS 301 DS as the smallest alpine machine, and the TS 4000 which has a working width of 41.01 ft (12.50 m). There are several different patents and innovations here, one being the ‘jet effect’. Manufacturing plant Fella manufacturing plant in Feucht, Germany, 2010 Since the founding of Fella in 1918, the property size has grown and decreased in size. In the beginning Fella was approximately and at one point grew to be approximately . At its current size, Fella is 11.37 ft (4.60 ha) with five separate buildings. In 1997, Fella brought in a new concept to the way their manufacturing plant was set up. The decision was made to create four self-governing buildings. Each of these buildings would be responsible for its own machine type: one building for drum mowers, one for disc mowers, one for tedders, and one for rakes. There would be two responsible managers for the factory workers as well as the production requirements and plant management. Because of these modifications that helped increase productivity, and improve flexibility and quality, Fella won the 1998 International Best Factory Award.IBFA Partners References External links * fella.eu (official website) AGCO Agricultural machinery manufacturers of Germany Companies based in Bavaria Manufacturing companies established in 1918 1918 establishments in Germany ","title":"Fella-Werke"},{"id":"31191446","text":"Oscar Marion Graham (July 20, 1878 – October 15, 1931) was a professional baseball pitcher.

The plane was on its way from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv via Zurich, and was due to take off at Zurich International Airport. Several of the crew members were injured during the attack, and one later died of his injuries. The plane was severely damaged. A greater disaster was averted when Mordechai Rahamim, an undercover Israeli security agent stationed on the plane, opened fire at the attackers and killed the terrorist leader.Samuel M. Katz. Israel versus Jibril: the thirty-year war against a master terrorist. Paragon House, 1993. p.27 Rahamim and the three surviving attackers were arrested and tried by Swiss authorities. The attackers were found guilty and given prison sentences, while Rahamim was acquitted.  The attack  The terrorist cell ambushed the plane which was preparing for takeoff at the Zurich International Airport in Kloten. During that time the plane had 17 passengers and 11 crew members on board. Leaping out of a vehicle parked near a hangar, two terrorists opened fire with AK-47 assault rifles, and another two tossed incendiary grenades as well as dynamite that failed to explode. The cockpit and fuselage were hit, seriously wounding several people including co-pilot Yoram Peres, who died of his wounds a month later. The plane's security guard Mordechai Rahamim, a twenty two year old former soldier in the Israeli elite special forces unit Sayeret Matkal, ran to the cockpit and fired at the attackers from the window with his Beretta .22 pistol, and then jumped out of the plane through the rear emergency slide door and continued the shootout with the attackers. During the shootout, Rahamim killed the squad leader, and the battle eventually ended when the Swiss security forces arrived at the scene. Rahamim helped the Swiss authorities apprehend the remaining attackers, but was himself arrested, and his weapon confiscated.  Aftermath  Damage to the aircraft was estimated at $100,000. Rahamim was arrested by the Swiss police, along with the members of the terrorist cell. The terrorists were found to be carrying many weapons and explosives as well as leaflets in German which were intended to be used to explain the goals of the operation to the Swiss people, comparing it to William Tell's operations. During an investigation it became clear that the terrorists came to Switzerland from Damascus, and the weapons and explosives were brought to Switzerland through diplomatic mail of an Arab country. During the interrogation Mordechai Rahamim admitted that he worked for Israel's security services. After a month in arrest he was released on bail until the beginning of his trial. Rahamim returned to Israel. = The trial = On 27 November 1969, the trial of Rahamim and the three terrorists, Mohamed Abu Al- Haija, Ibrahim Tawfik Youssef and Amina Dahbour, began in Winterthur, Switzerland. The state of Israel sent the state prosecutor Gabriel Bach to Switzerland to handle the defense of Rahamim. An indictment was filed against the three terrorists which included deliberate homicide of a person. The indictment against Rahamim included two sections: deliberate homicide of a person due to a serious excitement which occurred as a result of circumstances justifying the excitement, and an illegal action on behalf of a foreign country. During the trial Israel was forced to admit for the first time that security personnel accompany Israeli flights, to prevent hijackings and terrorism from happening in the air. On 23 December 1969 the trial ended. Rahamim was acquitted on charges of killing the terrorist squad leader and three terrorists were sentenced to twelve years imprisonment and hard labor. They were released a year later, in September 1970, following the Dawson's Field hijackings by members of a Palestinian terrorist organization who demanded the release of the imprisoned terrorists.

Below is a list of characters who made their debut in 1985 in chronological order of first appearance, including Gloria Todd (Sue Jenkins), whose time on the show included brief relationships with Alan Bradley and Mike Baldwin; and Martin Platt, who married Gail Tilsley, and was a regular on the show until 2005, before returning for three episodes in 2018. Gloria Todd Gloria Todd was played by Sue Jenkins between 1985 and 1988. She famously served as a bridesmaid at Bet Lynch's 1987 wedding to Alec Gilroy, looking not dissimilar to a milking maid. Gloria was unlucky in love, at one point having a daliance with Alan Bradley. She left the street after stealing the boyfriend of The Rovers cleaner Sandra Stubbs. Sandra called Gloria a tart and threw a pint of beer in her face. Gloria had been a barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn. Martin Platt Connie Clayton Constance \\"Connie\\" Clayton and her family moved into 11 Coronation Street in January 1985 and turned their front room into a work room so that Connie could run her dressmaking business. Jack Duckworth bought his wife Vera a dress length of silver lurex and Connie took on the job of producing a dress that 'will make Joan Collins look like a lollipop lady'. Vera was not happy with the results and whilst Connie agreed that the dress looked a right mess on her, she insisted that it fitted properly and was worth the £45 fee but Jack and Vera refused to pay and a feud developed between the families. The fighting between the families was ruining Terry Duckworth's romance with Andrea Clayton and so he tried to pay the bill for his mother, but Connie refused to accept his money. The feud over the dress was soon forgotten when Andrea announced that she was pregnant with Terry's child. Connie stood by her daughter and agreed to look after the baby while Andrea attended university. After Vera started announcing her own plans for her new grandchild, the family did a moonlight flit and moved away from Weatherfield. In December 2000, Connie returned briefly to visit her grandson Paul in hospital after Vera had donated a kidney to him in order to save his life after Terry had refused to be a donor. Connie made peace with Vera and thanked her for saving Paul's life. Harry Clayton Harold \\"Harry\\" Clayton was a trombone playing milkman, who, with his family, bought 11 Coronation Street off Bill Webster in 1985. A feud developed with the Duckworths, who live next door, after they refused to pay a bill for a dress that Harry wife, Connie had made for Vera and eventually escalated to violence in the Rovers Return Inn when Jack asked Harry if he was sure that the father of their daughter Andrea's baby was his son Terry. Harry and Connie stood by their daughter and agreed to look after the baby while Andrea attended university. After Vera started announcing her own plans for her new grandchild, the family did a moonlight flit and moved away from Weatherfield. Sue Clayton Susan \\"Sue\\" Clayton had just left school when she was first seen and later secured a job in a local bakery. Sue left Weatherfield with the rest of her family in a moonlight flit to get away from the Duckworths in order to raise her sister Andrea's baby. Andrea Clayton Andrea Clayton moved into 11 Coronation Street in January 1985 with her parents and younger sister. Whilst studying for her A-levels, Andrea started dating next door neighbour, Terry Duckworth, behind her parents' backs and was shocked to learn that she was pregnant, but refused to allow Terry to be part of the child's life, even though he wanted to stand by her. Her parents decided that the best way forward was for Connie to look after the baby while Andrea went to university. When Vera Duckworth wanted to be involved in plans for her grandchild's future, the Clayton family packed up overnight and left Weatherfield. Eventually word reached Terry that Andrea had given birth to a boy and named him Paul. Andrea visited the Duckworths' in November 2000 and explained that Paul needed a kidney transplant urgently. Although Terry exploited the situation for his gain, Vera stepped in and saved Paul by giving him one of her kidneys. In November 2001, Andrea brought Paul to visit Jack and Vera Sam Tindall Sam Tindall was a recurring character on the British soap opera Coronation Street. portrayed by Tom Mennard for various stints between 1985 and 1989. Sam himself never married, and was kept company by his dog Dougal, which he kept in a bag. In September 1985, while readying himself for the bowls tournament, he took a fancy to Phyllis Pearce. Phyllis was after Percy Sugden, Sam's competitor in the tournament. Phyllis liked the thought of making Percy jealous by being seen with Sam and so she told Sam she would go to the bowling club outing to Southport with whoever won the finals. In fact, Percy had no interest in Phyllis and was so horrified at the thought of Phyllis having him all to herself that he considered throwing the game - but he was too proud to go through with it and he won. For Phyllis, Sam had now served his purpose, but the battle for her hand continued for some years and Sam was a semi-regular fixture in the Rovers Return Inn and Jim's Café until 1989. Phyllis took more interest in Sam when she found out he won a fortune on the pools in the 1950s and spent it on property. Sam was now penniless as his houses were falling down but he saw this as a way in with Phyllis and made the most of it. He was Phyllis's date for her 65th birthday party, and they were having a good time until Sam saw Phyllis dancing with Percy and accused Phyllis of playing with his affections. Phyllis was upset, until he revealed that he had no fortune to bequeath, upon which the status quo was restored. In December 1985, Sam offered Terry Duckworth and Curly Watts the use of Dougal to catch a rat in the builder's yard. He tried to swindle them by passing off a ferret as a rat so they'd pay him to catch it. Also that month, Sam won a Christmas pudding in a pub raffle, but a drunken Alf Roberts sat on it at his stag party, and a forlorn Sam annoyed Bet Lynch by accusing her of losing it. In April 1987, Sam turned up at one of Percy's over-60s tea-dance sessions. Percy entered the group in a competition but the dancers preferred Sam to lead them and voted Percy down. Percy hit back by cancelling their entry into the competition. Later that year, Sam briefly pursued Vera Duckworth's mother Amy Burton, but by 1988 he was after Phyllis again. Phyllis had come to like having Sam around but she still used him to get to Percy - on one occasion, she complained to Percy that Sam was pestering her, and was then pleased when Percy berated Sam when he overheard Sam telling people he never had much time for women. He last called at the café in May 1989 Janet Bamford Janet Bamford was a recurring character on the British soap opera Coronation Street. Janet was a secretary at the Weatherfield Recorder, and worked as Ken Barlow's personal assistant. Janet worked mornings only and cared for her disabled husband John the rest of the time. Unlike her predecessor Sally Waterman, Janet had no journalistic ambitions and was content with her minimal responsibilities, including making the coffee. In her three years at the Recorder, she presented no problems to Ken and they got along well. In 1988, the Clarion Group bought Bob Statham's share of the Recorder. Statham had been a sleeping partner but the Clarion's boss, Nick Cavanagh, had big ideas for the paper and asked Janet to work overtime however due to John being confined to bed, Janet had to decline. Ken considered the matter closed but Nick pursued it and convinced Ken that they needed someone more dynamic in the office full-time. Ken reluctantly gave Janet her notice. When given the news, Janet was understanding and told Ken she'd been expecting it. 1985 *, Coronation Street Coronation Street ","title":"List of Coronation Street characters (1985)"},{"id":"31191679","text":"The St. Andrews Patrol Cabin was built by the National Park Service in 1922 as part of a network of stations near the boundaries of Mount Rainier National Park for rangers on patrol.

It was described as the first war crimes trial held in Britain at the time. Dering alleged that Uris had libelled him in a footnote in his novel Exodus, which described his participation in medical experiments in Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. The case was tried in the High Court of Justice before Mr Justice Lawton and a jury between April and May 1964. On 6 May, the jury returned a verdict for Dering, but awarded him contemptuous damages of one halfpenny, the smallest coin in the currency. As a result, Dering became liable for the defendants' legal costs. The trial attracted wide media coverage. In particular, The Times provided extensive coverage of the case, printing large portions of the testimony presented in court. The novel QB VII and its 1974 miniseries adaptation are loosely based on this case.John Sutherland, Bestsellers: Popular Fiction of the 1970s (Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd, 1981) Background Dr Wladislaw Alexander Dering was a Polish doctor who was imprisoned at Auschwitz during the Second World War for resistance activities. After the war, he reached Britain, but was detained by the British government as an alleged war criminal, while the Polish government sought his extradition. In 1948, he was released, the Home Secretary having decided that there was insufficient evidence to support a prima facie case against him. Dering thereupon joined the Colonial Medical Service, running a hospital in Hargeisa, British Somaliland. For his services, he was appointed an OBE in 1960. The same year, he returned to England and established a medical practice in North London. After his return, his family drew his attention to a passage in the novel Exodus by American author Leon Uris. The passage, on page 155, read: > Here in Block X Dr. Wirths used women as guinea pigs and Dr. Schumann > sterilized by castration and X-ray and Clauberg removed ovaries and Dr. > Dehring performed 17,000 'experiments' in surgery without anaesthetics. Dering issue writs for libel against Uris, his British publishers William Kimber & Co Ltd, and the printers. The printers settled the case before the trial for £500 and an apology. Uris and William Kimber admitted the words at issue were defamatory against Dr Dering, but pleaded that the words were true in substance and in fact, save for some particularized exceptions.  The trial  The trial opened in the High Court of Justice in London on 13 April 1964 before Mr Justice Lawton and a jury. Colin Duncan QC (with Brian Neill) appeared for Dering, while Lord Gardiner (with David Hirst and Louis Blom- Cooper) represented the defendants. In court, Dering denied having carried out experimental operations. He claimed he removed prisoners' sexual organs because Schumann had asked Dering to assist him by removing the organs. He did not feel he could refuse, because he thought it was better for him to perform the operations than if they were performed by an untrained person. Furthermore, he claimed the organs he removed were already damaged, and that he removed them for the benefit of the prisoners' health. He also claimed he feared for his life if he did not comply with Schumann's request. Finally, he denied having operation without anaesthetics, and claimed that of the 17,000 operations he performed at Auschwitz, only about 130 were not ordinary proper operations. The defence admitted that the figure of 17,000 'experiments' was inflated, and that some anesthetics was administered. However, they disputed Dering's claim that his life would have been in danger if he had not carried out the operations. They also disputed Dering's claim that the anesthesia was effective. The defense presented a number of witnesses who had been operated upon by Dering, as well as prisoners-doctors who had worked with Dering. The doctors testified that they had refused the Nazi doctors' requests to assist them in their experiments, and had not been punished as a consequence. One of the trial's most dramatic moments occurred during the testimony of Dr Adélaïde Hautval, an imprisoned French psychiatrist who worked in the camp's hospital. She testified that she refused to assist the Nazi doctors in the experiments: > Gardiner: As a result were you shot? Hautval: No Gardiner: Were you punished > in any way? Hautval: No. She then testified that she told Dr Wirths that performing the operations was against her conception of medicine. > Hautval: He asked me, \\"Cannot you see that these people are different from > you?\\" and I answered him that there were several people different from me, > beginning from him. Gardiner: I shall not ask you again whether you were > shot. Did Dr Wirths say anything further? Hautval: He never said anything. The jury awarded Dering a halfpenny in damages, the smallest coin of the realm. Since publisher and author had paid a marginally larger token sum of £2 into court, Dering was liable for all the legal costs amounting to £25,000 from that point, due to court rules. Dering died, however, leaving Kimber saddled with the heavy legal costs. At a news conference held at the Howard Hotel by Uris and publisher Kimber, Uris is reported to have made a comment that future editions of Exodus would omit Dr Dering's name. Uris and the publishers, William Kimber and Company, admitted that a paragraph in the book, referring to Auschwitz medical experiments, was defamatory to Dr Dering, but they also contended that it was true in substance, subject to certain qualifications. The trial received extensive coverage. Breaking with tradition whereby it only reported judgments, The Times Law Report sent two reporters to report on the trial. The Times' reports were later published in book form (Auschwitz in England, 1965). It was said that the newspaper's circulation rose for the first time since the end of the Second World War as a result of its coverage. Uris had copied his data from Underground by Joseph Tennenbaum when he referred to doctors working in Auschwitz.

The war came in the aftermath of the First Iraqi–Kurdish War (1961–1970), as the 1970 peace plan for Kurdish autonomy had failed to be implemented by 1974. Unlike the previous guerrilla campaign in 1961–1970, waged by Barzani, the 1974 war was a Kurdish attempt at symmetric warfare against the Iraqi Army, which eventually led to the quick collapse of the Kurds, who were lacking advanced and heavy weaponry. The war ended with the exile of the Iraqi KDP party and between 7,000–20,000 deaths from both sides combined. Background Kurds led by Mustafa Barzani were engaged in heavy fighting against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975. The First Iraqi–Kurdish War (1961–1970) led to a stalemate and in March 1970 Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy. The plan was to be implemented in four years. However, at the same time, the Iraqi regime started an Arabization program in the oil-rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin.\\"Introduction\\". Genocide in Iraq: The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds (Human Rights Watch Report, 1993). Conflict erupts The 1970 peace agreement did not last long, and in 1974, the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurdish rebels, pushing them close to the border with Iran. As in the First Iraqi-Kurdish War, the Kurds received material support from Iran and Israel. Israel regarded the Iraqi military as a possible threat in case of renewed fighting between Israel and Syria (during the 1973 War about one third of Iraq's army had been sent to fight against Israel on the Syrian front) and so wished to keep the Iraqis occupied elsewhere. Iran wished to strengthen its own political and military position vis-à-vis Iraq—the only other regional power in the Persian Gulf. As the fighting progressed, Iraq informed Tehran that it was willing to satisfy Iranian demands in return for an end to its aid to the Kurds. In March 1975, with mediation by Algerian President Houari Boumédiènne, Iraq and Iran signed the Algiers Accord. According to the accord Iran would quit supplying the Iraqi Kurds in return for the transfer of Iraqi territory to Iran—especially half the width of the Shatt al-Arab, the river through which ships could sail to a number of major Iranian ports. Israel's aid to the Kurds was being transferred through Iran, so Iran's decision also prevented the continuation of Israeli aid to the Kurds (the only other possible route being Turkey which was also hostile to the idea of a Kurdish autonomy in northern Iraq as a dangerous precedent for the Kurds in eastern Turkey). Following this development, Barzani escaped to Iran with many of his supporters. Others surrendered en masse and the rebellion ended within a short time. The casualties of the war are estimated around 5,000 soldiers and civilians. Aftermath As a result, the Iraqi government extended its control over the Iraqi Kurdistan after fifteen years and in order to secure its influence, started an Arabization program by moving Arabs to the vicinity of oil fields in Kurdistan, particularly the ones around Kirkuk.Harris (1977), p. 121. The repressive measures carried out by the government against the Kurds after the Algiers agreement led to renewed clashes between the Iraqi Army and Kurdish guerrillas in 1977. In 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burned down and around 200,000 Kurds were deported to other parts of the country. In the early 1980s, with the eruption of the Iran–Iraq War, another Kurdish rebellion erupted in northern Iraq, initiated with Iranian support. The revolt ended with a massive killing campaign by Saddam Hussein in 1986–1989. During the Al-Anfal campaign an estimated 182,000 Kurds lost their lives in north Iraq and hundreds of thousands forced to become refugees, fleeing mostly to neighbouring Iran. The area underwent chaos again in 1991 following the Persian Gulf War. Encouraged by Saddam's defeat in Kuwait, the Shi'as and the Kurds openly revolted against the Ba'athist regime. The defection of the government-recruited Kurdish Jash home guard militia gave considerable force to the revolt. Unlike the failed Shi'a rebellion in the south, the Kurdish uprising eventually led to the establishment of the Kurdistan Region.

He painted many portrait miniatures of Queen Victoria, the Royal Family and other nobility. Life and work Haslem was born in 1808 at Carrington in Cheshire (now part of Greater Manchester). He left home as a young boy to live in Derby with his uncle James Thomason, who went on to manage the Derby China factory. He studied under local ceramic artist, George Hancock, and first devoted himself to flower- painting, but subsequently took to figure-painting, in which he was very successful. Haslem painted the head of Lord Byron for the Duke of Sussex as a present for the King of Greece, and at the Duke's instigation came to London and studied under Edmund Thomas Parris. He copied many pictures in miniature on enamel, and was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy from 1836-1865. In 1842 he won a medal from the Society of Arts for a portrait painted on china. He painted a small enamel portrait of Queen Victoria, and this led to many other commissions from the Royal Family and nobility, especially for copies of ancestral portraits. Papers relating to Haslem's career including a letter of his are held by Derby Museum and Art Gallery.Artists' Paper Register , accessed June 2011 Haslem was also in demand, by jewellers and art dealers, and on one occasion was employed to paint a set of enamels in imitation of Petitot, which were so successful that they appeared in the miniature exhibitions at the South Kensington Museum, in 1862 and 1865, as the work of Petitot himself. In 1857, Haslem returned to Derby to live with his uncle and remained there until his death in 1884. In 1876 he had published a history of \\"The Old Derby China Factory\\" (pub. George Bell). Haslem gave his collection of porcelain to Derby Museum including the Prentice Plate which he had been lucky enough to buy in London. The Prentice Plate was used by apprentices at porcelain painting in Derby and this plate was a demonstration of William Billingsley's skills when he worked there. This plate is now on display at Derby Museum.Label for the 'Prentice Plate in Derby Museum, read July 2011 References External links *John Haslem on Artnet *Portrait miniatures by John Haslem (Royal Collection) *Portrait of Lyon Playfair (Enamel, 1854 - National Portrait Gallery, London) *The education of Cupid (Copy of a work by Correggio, Pencil and watercolour, 1844 - Christie's) 1808 births 1884 deaths People from Cheshire 19th-century English painters English male painters Portrait miniaturists English enamellers 19th-century enamellers Porcelain painters Flower artists People associated with Derby Museum and Art Gallery People from Derby ","title":"John Haslem (artist)"},{"id":"31191751","text":"Dragomir \\"Gagi\\" Mihajlović () is a Serbian rock guitarist.

Created by writer Tony Warren, Coronation Street first broadcast on ITV on 9 December 1960. The following is a list of characters introduced in the show's twenty-eighth year, by order of first appearance. Sarah Platt Sarah-Louise Platt (née Tilsley; previously Grimshaw) is a fictional character from the British soap opera Coronation Street. She was born on screen during the episode broadcast on 2 February 1987. She was played by Leah King in 1987 and by Lynsay King from 1987 until 8 October 1999 when King opted to leave to focus on her education. Tina O'Brien took over the role on 31 October 1999; she opted to leave in 2007 and made her final on-screen appearance on 30 December 2007. A number of false rumours about O'Brien returning to the role surfaced during her absence from the serial. In October 2014, it was announced that O'Brien had reprised the role, she returned to filming in February 2015 and returned on screen on 30 March 2015. Sarah's storylines have included a controversial and ground-breaking underage pregnancy which saw her giving birth to Bethany Platt (Amy & Emily Walton, Lucy Fallon) and saw Sarah deal with motherhood in her teens, internet grooming, her friendship with Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson), her relationships with Todd (Bruno Langley) and Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) as well as her sibling rivalry between her and her half-brother David Platt (Thomas Ormson, Jack P. Shepherd). Her exit storyline saw her leave Weatherfield to start a new life with Bethany in Milan. Her return storyline saw her track down Bethany who had run away from home and returned to Weatherfield and begin a relationship with brother David's enemy Callum Logan (Sean Ward). Sarah was a central character in the shows third live episode which was aired to commemorate 60 years of ITV. Cecil Newton Cecil Newton was the Brewery boss of Newton & Ridley. He first appeared in 1987 when Alec Gilroy wanted the tenancy of the Rovers Return Inn, as Bet Lynch had used the money she borrowed from Alec to buy the tenancy, but fled to Spain as she could not pay it back. Cecil agreed and also sent Alec out to Spain to search for Bet when they found out she was working in a bar there. Bet married Alec and they successfully applied for the tenancy. Cecil arrived in the pub a year later in 1988 when he suggested to Alec that the rent for staying in the Rovers should be increased, as the establishment was making a lot of money - unsurprisingly, Alec disagreed. When the Gilroys' were at risk of losing the pub in 1990, due to it being repossessed in preparation for a merge with 1 Coronation Street and conversion into an American theme pub, the local residents campaigned and argued with the brewery. Cecil came out of retirement to put a halt on the plans and told Bet and Alec that the pub was still theirs, belittling project manager Nigel Ridley for his foolish young ideas in the process, and declaring that the Rovers would always remain a working man's pub. 13 years after he was last seen on the street, Bet met him again in November 2003 at the Newton & Ridley function in Blackpool. Cecil fell in love with her and asked her to marry him. However, Cecil's son, Philip, disapproved and tried to split them up and even told Bet that Cecil was going senile. During the ceremony, Cecil collapsed with a heart attack and later died in hospital. Don Brennan Donald Michael \\"Don\\" Brennan was played by Geoffrey Hinsliff. Don first appeared as a love interest for Ivy Tilsley and they eventually get engaged and married on 13 June 1988. Don had two daughters and a son from his first marriage, but his family never appeared again after the wedding episode. On Christmas Eve 1990, Rosie Webster was born to parents Kevin and Sally in the back of his taxi. Ivy's erratic behaviour over preserving the memory of her dead son Brian and first husband Bert led Don to look elsewhere for romance. He developed a fascination with local hairdresser Denise Osbourne who he harassed with anonymous phone calls. He supported Gail and her new husband Martin Platt, to adopt Nick and Sarah. He and Ivy separated in 1992 after Don had an affair, but they reconciled after Don attempted suicide by crashing his taxi and had his leg amputated. Their marriage later ended, and Ivy left Don for a Catholic retreat in the spring of 1994 before her death in August 1995. Don developed a gambling problem, and ended up owing a lot of money to people - including his sworn enemy Mike Baldwin. After Ivy left Coronation Street, he had a relationship with Josie Clarke, who briefly worked for Mike. They planned to make money by buying his garage from him, only to discover that he had scammed them, and it was worth far less than they had paid for it. Josie left Don when he became obsessed with getting revenge on Mike. In 1997, Don kidnapped Mike's wife Alma and drove his taxi into the canal with her inside - but they were both rescued and survived. Don was arrested and charged with attempted murder, but managed to escape custody and turned up in the Rovers Return Inn; he tried to kill Mike by strangling him with his tie, but local publican Jack Duckworth caught Don in the act and threw him out. In October 1997, Don tried one last time to kill Mike - this time in Mike's flat. Don tied him up and held him prisoner, but Mike managed to free himself and phone the police. Don was re-arrested the following morning and charged again with attempted murder. Don escaped from custody once more, and returned to Coronation Street yet again - intent on killing Mike. Don reappeared in the street in Alma's MG Midget Roadster, which he had stolen, and saw Mike crossing the street by The Kabin. He drove straight at Mike and tried to run him over, but Mike dived out of the way just in time. Don lost control of the car and crashed into the viaduct. Mike escaped unharmed, but Don was killed when the car exploded in a fireball on impact, burning him to death. The resulting stain was evident for many years on the viaduct. Barry Platt Barry Platt was the father of Martin Platt. In September 1987, Rita Fairclough called at his house after she spotted Martin in Weatherfield when she had believed him to be in France with Jenny Bradley. Martin was not at home, but Barry confirmed that he had been back in the country for some time. Martin later explained to Rita that Jenny had refused to return with him and had remained in France with some students she befriended. Four years later, Barry attended Martin's wedding to Gail Tilsley, along with his wife Barbara. After the wedding, Barbara stayed on at Gail's house, 33 Hammond Road, to look after Gail and Martin's children while they went on a honeymoon to Abersoch, which Barry and Barbara had booked as a surprise to them which they presented at the reception in the Rovers Return. Barry was played by John Jardine in 1987 and Richard Conway in 1991. It is not known why the character was recast although it was possibly because of Jardine's role as Randolph Taylor, a character he played in nine episodes in 1990 and reprised in 1992. In his 1991 appearance, the character was credited as Brian Platt. Amy Burton Amy Burton was a fictional character from the British soap opera Coronation Street, portrayed by actress Fanny Carby. Amy was the mother of long-time resident Vera Duckworth, who moved into Terry Duckworth's freshly-vacated, freshly-decorated back bedroom - to the chagrin of Vera's husband Jack, who wanted to give the bedroom to his fellow decorator Wendy Farmer. Amy arrives from Rusholme, and Jack tries too persuade her she doesn't want to lose her independence, but Amy is determined to stay with Jack and Vera until she dies. Amy soon sets her roots in Coronation Street, nagging Jack about his pigeons and developing an addiction for the slot machine in the public bar of the Rovers Return Inn. Vera won't hear a bad word said about Amy, from Jack or her best friend Ivy Tilsley, in face of Amy's abrasive behaviour. This leads to Jack threatening to leave Vera, unless Amy leaves first. Vera is upset that the two don't get on, but refuses to listen to Jack's argument. After pleading with Jack to give Amy another chance, and being refused, Vera decides that it is the lesser of two evils to throw Jack out into the street. The two do, however, reach a compromise and Jack sleeps on the sofa. However, Jack persuades Amy to take on a job and get out from under his feet. In Christmas 1987, Hilda Ogden quits her job at the Rovers Return Inn, ahead of her retirement from Weatherfield to Hartington, Derbyshire. Against Vera's wishes, Amy takes over Hilda's cleaning job for Bet and Alec Gilroy. This horrifies Jack, as it means he spends his work and home life in the same building as his mother-in-law. Jack tries in vain to get Hilda to take her job back, but Hilda is adamant that she won't return. Meanwhile, Amy causes trouble for the area's elder menfolk, accusing Percy Sugden of lechery, and telling Sam Tindall that he is \\"gorgeous\\". However, Amy herself falls into trouble when Sally Webster sees her shoplifting from Alf Roberts's shop, and then giving them to Vera as \\"presents\\". Audrey Roberts decides not to pursue the idea when Amy creates a fuss, but trouble doesn't end when Vera accuses Alf and Sally of setting Amy up. Amy's problem worsens, especially when Jack finds out she has been stealing bottles of stout from the Rovers. Jack is in charge of stocktaking and worries that Alec will accuse him of stealing. Vera refuses to believe it, but eventually realises that he is right. When Vera challenges Amy, she is accused of turning on her. Amy accuses Jack of being a terrible husband, and that he deserves to be thrown out. Vera finally sees Amy for what she is and loses her temper; Amy threatens to leave, and Vera calls her out on it. Vera packs Amy's cases and dumps her on Amy's sister, Edie. In 1991, Amy's other sister Cissie calls Vera, breaking the news that Amy suffered a fatal heart attack while playing a game of bingo. Vera is riddled with guilt, having not visited Amy for some time. Jack tries to get out of the funeral, but makes a genuine effort for Vera at the funeral - but at the wake, he reverts to type and makes cracks about Amy's shoplifting. Cissie reveals to Jack and Vera that the only wish in Amy's will was that she take in Amy's friend, Joss Shackleton, who tells Vera that he is her natural father.

Located about one kilometre or just over half a mile below the Old Castle of Ansembourg, it was built by the industrialist Thomas Bidart in 1639.\\"Jardin du grand château d'Ansembourg\\", Service des Sites et Monuments Nationaux. Retrieved 15 March 2011. History In 1639, Thomas Bidart built the central part of today's castle as a comfortable house surrounded by walls and towers, two of which still stand. Originally from Liège in Belgium, Bidart, who was a pioneer of Luxembourg's iron and steel industry, named the building Maison des Forges (House of the Ironworks). During the Thirty Years' War, he tapped the region's many water sources and exploited its timber and iron, manufacturing arms at a foundry close to the old castle. As a result, his family prospered, earning rights to the title of Lords of Amsembourg which had belonged to the Raville family until 1671. It was the de Marchant family who, after inheriting the property by marriage, undertook its astonishing transformation into today's modern-looking castle. In 1719, the courtyard was extended with two wings on either side of the original building. The southern gable was enhanced with a magnificent arch where four statues represent the four continents. Fitted with two small towers, the new façade overlooked the gardens which were connected to the castle through an arcade. The first-floor balcony above the porch provided an excellent view of the gardens, complete with flowerbeds and a fountain. Between 1740 and 1750, Lambert Joseph de Marchant et d'Ansembourg further improved the gardens and extended the buildings on the north side of the main courtyard so that they could be used as stables and lodgings for the castle staff. In 1759, Count Lambert Joseph added the impressive Baroque gateway bearing the arms of de Marchant of Ansembourg and Velbruck.\\"Plus de details sur l’histoire...\\", Grand Château d'Ansembourg. Retrieved 15 March 2011. The castle today In the early 1970s the castle hosted an foreign studies program for students from three American private Catholic Colleges. Students lived in the newly created dorms on the second floor, and took classes in Literature, Art History, Music Education, and Foreign Language. They also assisted with art restoration and teaching music at DuPont International School. One of the partner colleges, Mercy College of Detroit, sent professors. Students had complete access to the castle and its furnishings, including the Music Room that had pink gilt furniture and a grand piano. Since 1987, the castle has belonged to the Japanese new religious organisation Sûkyô Mahikari which uses the castle as its European and Africa headquarters and holds monthly Ceremonies and seminars throughout the year for its members. Sukyo Mahikari promotes such concepts as \\"The Baptism by Fire.\\" which can be survived with \\"Salvation by Divine Light.\\" The members claim to be able to radiate Divine Light from their hands after attending a three day seminar. Sukyo Mahikari has undertaken substantial renovation work with the assistance of Luxembourg's Service des Sites et Monuments nationaux. Initially work was centred on reinforcing the foundations and walls and on restoring the staircase of honour on the upper terrace in the gardens. From 1999, the statues and the fountains in the garden were repaired while the roofs over the two wings and the central section were rebuilt. Work is now concentrated on restoring the oldest part of the building which dates from the 17th century.\\"Restauration du château et promenade dans les jardins\\", Grand Château d'Ansembourg.

Nick Tilsley Nicholas Paul \\"Nick\\" Tilsley (also Platt) was born off screen during an episode broadcast on 31 December 1980, but made his first appearance on 5 January 1981. He was played by Warren Jackson from 1981 until 6 September 1996. Adam Rickett took over the role on 15 October 1997 until 21 April 1999 but returned for three separate stints between 2002 and 2004 and made his final appearance as Nick on 11 July 2004. Ben Price took over the role on 21 December 2009. Nick is the first-born child of Brian (Christopher Quinten) and Gail Tilsley (Helen Worth). He is the older brother of Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) and David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) as well as the uncle of Bethany (Lucy Fallon), and Lily Platt and the grandson of Audrey Roberts. Nick's storylines have included his adolescent problems and his role in the fraught relationship between his parents, his teenage marriage to Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) and their divorce, and his engagement to Maria Connor (Samia Smith). Since his return in 2009 his storylines have featured him remarrying and once again divorcing Leanne, his one-night stand with David's wife Kylie Platt (Paula Lane), suffering brain damage after being involved in car accident which was caused by David, and his business partnership with and later one-day marriage to Carla Connor (Alison King). Eunice Gee Eunice Gee (née Clarke, previously Nuttall) born 1937 had been a barmaid and was a dry-cleaner when she met Fred Gee at a singles evening. This fitted in with his plans, as he had the chance of the licence of The Crown and Kettle - but the brewery would only consider married couples. They married after a whirlwind romance, but The Crown and Kettle had already been taken and then the next pub fell through when the brewery found out Eunice had previously been sacked from the Foundryman's Arms after £30 disappeared, although she always blamed this on another barmaid. Annie Walker threw them out of the Rovers Return Inn when they were refused the pub, as the overbearing Eunice acted as though she owned the place and upset both Annie and Betty Turpin. For a while, they ran the Community Centre and moved in there with Eunice's daughter, Debbie, but the marriage started to fall apart. Councillor Ben Critchley, Chairman of the Social Services committee found that the Gees had got the Community Centre through Alf Roberts, without his authority and proceeded to evict them. Conveniently, Ben Critchley was able to offer positions at his Park View Hotel in Weatherfield, and even more conveniently, as he had an eye for Eunice, he knew she would accept but Fred refuse. Fred reluctantly accepted that their marriage would not work; he moved back into the Rovers and the marriage ended. In November 1983 she said she wanted to remarry and divorced Fred. In 1999 she turned up again, running the Park Road B&B; where Jack and Vera Duckworth stayed after leaving the Rovers. In May 1999 her brother-in-law died suddenly in Spain, and Eunice went out there to help her sister Dolly run her bar, leaving the Duckworths running the B&B.; Alma Halliwell 1981 *, Coronation Street Coronation Street ","title":"List of Coronation Street characters (1981)"},{"id":"31191895","text":"Tyree Bernard Davis (born September 23, 1970 in Altheimer, Arkansas) is a former professional American football wide receiver.

Vicky McDonald Vicky Arden (also McDonald) was played by Helen Warburton in 1990 and Chloe Newsome from 1991 to 1998. She is Alec Gilroy's (Roy Barraclough) granddaughter and was the wife of Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). After first appearing in January 1990, Vicky visits Coronation Street when her parents Tim and Sandra Arden arrange for Alec and Bet to collect her from the train station when she arrived from boarding school so they can attend the funeral of Sandra's mother, Joyce. (Sandra did not want Vicky to attend as it would be too upsetting for her) However, on the day of Vicky's arrival the police arrive at the Rovers and tell Alec that Tim and Sandra have died in a car crash. Her grandfather Alec and his wife Bet (Julie Goodyear) become her legal guardians, as she is still only 14 years old. Vicky goes to a private boarding school and owns a horse called Saracen so holidays in a back street pub are not an attractive option. However, when she meets Steve McDonald, it is some compensation. Alec desperately tries to separate the couple but fails. She resists his sexual advances for a short time until finally she loses her virginity to him. This is not important to him and he also dates nurse Alison Rathbone. They then both dump him. After Alec leaves to go and work in Southampton, Vicky continues to return to the Rovers and treats Bet as her grandmother. On reaching her 18th birthday, Vicky inherits £240,000 from her parents. To Bet's distress, Vicky immediately abandons her studies and decides the money would be better than her schooling. She visits Alec for a while to explain her decision to him. When she returns, she is keen to confide in old flame Steve but he is seeing hairdresser Fiona Middleton (Angela Griffin), but Vicky gets his attention when she invests £1,500 in his T-shirt company. However, she loses her money when an order for Costello's nightclub falls through when the place goes bust. Rather than put her off, this inspires Vicky to enroll on a Business Studies course at the local technical college and she becomes Steve's business partner, insisting that she has control of the finances – annoying Fiona. This gets worse when Vicky and Steve go to Dublin for a 'business' weekend. Fiona dumps him, leaving the way clear for Vicky. She seduces him easily and they announce their engagement at Steve's 21st birthday party in 1995 – shocking everybody and incensing Bet. Alec returns for a spell to convince Vicky to end the relationship but it is to no avail. Alec even offers Steve £5,000 not to marry Vicky. Eventually, the pair marry in St Lucia - Bet gives her blessing as she knows that Vicky is happy. After their marriage, Vicky and Steve have a long honeymoon in the Caribbean and America. When they return, they turn their attention to the business, which needs another injection of capital – again provided by Vicky. Their relationship struggles, thanks to Steve spending Vicky's money and the final straw comes when he is arrested on Christmas Day 1995 for buying stolen whisky. He is guilty but persuades Vicky to bribe Malcolm Fox to say that Steve did not know that the whisky was stolen. Steve is freed and they assume that they were safe. However, the police discover the bribery when Malcolm Fox's wife confesses. Vicky and Steve are arrested and they stand trial, blaming each other and both are found guilty. Steve is sentenced to two years in prison and Vicky is given a one-year suspended sentence. She decides to get on with her life without Steve and enrolls in a hotel management course in an exclusive college in Switzerland. She leaves in June 1996 and divorces Steve while he is in prison. Vicky returns to the Street at Christmas 1998 with a bang. She accidentally hits Steve's car as she parks her car outside the Rovers while visiting Alec. Vicky has blossomed into a lovely young woman, a far cry from the spoilt, impressionable teen that came to the Rovers many years before. She has just bought a wine bar in Brighton and wants advice from her grandfather. Alec is having problems with the Duckworths, who are now licencees at the pub, and is getting very despondent so Vicky persuades him to go into partnership with her and Alec sells the Rovers to the recently widowed Natalie Barnes (Denise Welch), they leave Coronation Street together with hopes of a great future. In November 1999, Steve and his friend, Vikram Desai (Chris Bisson), are heading to Calais to buy cigarettes and alcohol. Vikram discovers they are going via Brighton to see Vicky. On arrival at \\"Vicky's\\" - the wine bar she owns - Steve discovers she is about to remarry. He plans to rekindle his relationship with her so he can get his hands on her money and business, betting Vikram £100 that he can stop the wedding. It transpires that Vicky's bar is actually in trouble as she asks Bet for a loan but she refuses. Steve successfully seduces Vicky and Vicky admits that she cannot marry her fiance, Robert. She also tells him she is broke and the wine bar is losing money. He promises to pick her up later and return to Weatherfield but Steve and Vikram leave without her. Vicky realises that she has been stood up so Bet takes her back to the bar and Vicky realises she does want to marry Robert after all. In 2002, Bet stated that Vicky was happily married. Tim Arden Tim Arden is husband of Sandra Arden and father of Vicky McDonald. Tim makes sparing appearances when his father-in-law Alec Gilroy visits the family. Tim makes his final appearance on 13 June 1990. 13 months later, shortly after Sandra was seen again on screen without Tim, a police sergeant arrives at the Rovers Return Inn to tell Alec that both Tim and Sandra have died in a car crash en route to Sandra's mother, Joyce's funeral. Sandra Arden Sandra Arden (also Gilroy) is the daughter of Alec and Joyce Gilroy. Alec decides to contact his daughter to make up for the last twenty years and gets Sandra's address from his ex-wife Joyce. After discovering that Sandra lives in a big house in Cheshire with her husband Tim and their daughter, Vicky. After initial misunderstandings between the Ardens and the Gilroys, Sandra tells Alec that he could keep in touch with them. In July 1991, Joyce dies and Sandra asks Alec to meet Vicky at boarding school and to let her stay at the Rovers Return so that she and Tim can attend Joyce's funeral in Whitby. Before the Gilroys set off for the train station, a Police Sergeant arrives to tell Alec that Sandra and Tim have both died in a car crash. Des Barnes Steph Barnes Stephanie \\"Steph\\" Barnes (née Jones), played by Amelia Bullmore, made her first screen appearance on 12 February 1990 and departed on 2 September 1991, she later returned for two separate stints in April 1992 and September 1995, making her final appearance on 4 October 1995. Steph and her husband Des Barnes (Philip Middlemiss) arrived in Coronation Street shortly after getting married, they moved into one of the newly built houses. As a wedding present, Steph's father and builder of the houses Maurice Jones (Alan Moore) sold the newly built 6 Coronation Street to the couple at cost price. The Barnes spent their honeymoon in Majorca after which they began settling into the Street. Steph worked at the perfume counter, and Des as a bookie's clerk. Steph and Des shared a devilish sense of humour; when Steph flirted with Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell for a laugh, making him scared of her, Des bet her that she couldn't shave off his moustache. Steph won the bet by throwing a housewarming party and luring Kevin upstairs and going at him with scissors. Architect Simon Beatty (Peter Gowen) commenced work on a warehouse next door to Steph's work. He would often come into the store to flirt with Steph, which she enjoyed. An affair began and Steph drifted away from Des. While on a date, Steph and Simon were seen kissing by her next-door neighbour Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin). Steph wasn't ready for Des to know the truth and asked Derek to keep what he'd seen to himself. Although he and his wife Mavis (Thelma Barlow) didn't tell Des, they made such nuisances of themselves lecturing Steph on her infidelity that Des warned Derek to stop pestering his wife, leading Mavis to blow Steph's secret in Derek's defence. Steph made the decision to leave Des for Simon. Des made one last attempt to stop Steph from leaving him by slashing her suitcases, but Steph moved out regardless. Over time, Simon grew jealous and possessive and Steph left him for another man. In order to avoid a messy break-up, she told Simon that there was nobody else and the relationship had just run its course. To throw Simon off the scent, Steph turned up at Des's door, asking if she could stay in the spare room for a few nights. Staying with Des made sense as Simon knew that Steph would never reconcile with him so she could use it as a refuge until the dust settled. However, her arrival sent out the wrong message to Des, who was eager for a reconciliation and let his current girlfriend Raquel Wolstenhulme (Sarah Lancashire) walk out on him after he sided with Steph against her in an argument. When Steph saw that Des was getting his hopes up, she confessed that she had a new boyfriend, breaking his heart again. A year later, the Barnes initiated divorce proceedings. Nearly two years after this, Des bumped into Steph who was working at a fast food outlet. Steph was heavily pregnant but she and the father were no longer in a relationship and she was living in a grotty bedsit. Des helped Steph find a flat and paid £500 as a deposit for her. Steph asked Des if he wanted to start again but Des didn't love her anymore and wanted to leave her in the past. Jackie Ingram Jacqueline Rachel \\"Jackie\\" Ingram (also Baldwin), played by Shirin Taylor, made her first screen appearance on 8 August 1990 and departed on 24 July 1991, later returning for two episodes on 13 April and 15 June 1992. Jackie was Peter Ingram's widow who fell for Mike Baldwin's charms and became his second wife. The marriage lasted a week before Jackie discovered he had only been after her money and had used some of it to help out his girlfriend, Alma Sedgewick. She threatened Mike with her shotgun before leaving him. Mike was given a tidy sum of money as a pay-off for a quick divorce. Angie Freeman Angela \\"Angie\\" Freeman moved into 7 Coronation Street to share with Jenny Bradley, into the room vacated by Flick and Joanne Khan. She was a free-spirited student studying Design at University and a woman who knew her own mind. In March 1991, Curly Watts moved in and they quickly became very close – but more as brother and sister than lovers, until one night when they had too much red wine and ended up in bed together. Both regretted it the next morning, but Curly always hoped that their relationship might develop into something more. After graduating, Angie was short of work, and worked unhappily for Mike Baldwin, and more happily for Hanif Ruparell. She found another soulmate in Des Barnes, but went on to have a rather confused and painful romance with Neil Mitchell. When she left Weatherfield for Mexico in March 1993 to study Aztec design, she left behind a few broken hearts. In December 1996, she called back on Weatherfield as a designer for Kbec - much to the annoyance of her former boss, Mike Baldwin, but Kbec troubles meant that by the following March they were both no longer in Kbec's employ. Angie returned to Weatherfield, and rented Des Barnes' house whilst he was on his canal barge, with the intention of setting up her own business.

Müller chaired the Norwegian Actors' Equity Association from 1901 to 1903, and from 1907 to 1913. From 1913 to 1916 he was theatre director at Trondhjems nationale Scene in Trondheim, a city much farther north. He died at the German spa town Bad Nauheim in 1922, after having finished a manuscript for Den nye lensmannen, a silent movie released in 1926, four years after his death. Family He was born in Bergen as the son of writer Amalie Skram (1846–1905) in her first marriage to ship captain Bernt Ulrik August Müller (1837–98) of Bergen. His brother Jacob Worm Müller (1866–1911) became journalist and writer. In 1895 he married Signe Grieg (1868–1960), a cousin of the composer Edvard Grieg. Their son John Grieg Müller (1898–1938) wrote plays, whereas their daughter Else Ulrikke Ludvigsdatter Grieg Müller (1900–76) became an actress and was married in 1933 to Erik Kristen-Johanssen (1901–76), business director and theatre director at Nationaltheatret. Ludvig married for the second time in 1912 to singer Margit Lunde (1881–1976) who accompanied Ludvig while touring the Nordic countries and also performed at Centralteatret 1907–14.

It is situated within the Tortuguero Conservation Area of the northeastern part of the country. Despite its remote location, reachable only by airplane or boat, it is the third-most visited park in Costa Rica. The park has a large variety of biological diversity due to the existence within the reserve of eleven different habitats, including rainforest, mangrove forests, swamps, beaches, and lagoons. Located in a tropical climate, it is very humid, and receives up to of rain a year. The park, a protected area within the northeastern Caribbean wetlands, was recognized under Ramsar Convention on 3 March 1991 for its rich biological diversity and ecosystems that support threatened flora and fauna species. Set in a natural wetland of the Caribbean coast, it forms a corridor with another protected area, the Indio Maíz Biological Reserve of Nicaragua. It is a key Ramsar Site. Geography Boat trip into the canals of Tortuguero Beach at Tortuguero National Park The park is located on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, and covers an area of . It is bounded with an elevation range of , indicative of a sea coastal region to low hilly topography. The Tortuguero National Park has over 20 miles of coastline, which provides sea turtles a protected place to lay their eggs. Tortuguero is bordered on the north by the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge (with habitats and climate similar to Tortuguero), to the south by the mouth of the Parismina River and the Cariari National Wetlands, the town of Tortuguero at the mouth of the Tortuguero River, and the Dr. Archie Carr Wildlife Refuge, which is a biological station to carry out turtle tagging program run by the Caribbean Conservation Corporation (Now known was the Sea Turtle Conservancy). While volcanic activity is reported as formation of a group of small islands, erosion has created the depressions which have a permeable base of \\"light grey, broken lava rocks, with harder rocks and grey or dark grey lavas overlying\\". Sandy soils resulting from sedimentation dominates the reserve with formation of parallel bars in the coastal area. The depressions are subject to filling by ephemeral floods; estuary lakes, grass marshes and wooded swamps caused by very heavy rainfall. Small tides of about height have also affected the coastal zone. The small rivers and streams that originate in the hills and flow through the park generally have water deep. The lakes in the northern part of the reserve are fed by the Colorado River. The very humid tropical forest is influenced by excessive humidity, rapid drainage and thin soils, with over 330 days of cloud cover per year. Moisture-laden winds come from the Caribbean. The park has worked with the neighboring village of Tortuguero to help its inhabitants understand that preserving their natural resources is the key to encourage eco-tourism. With rich water resources from a precipitation of per year, the drainage system of the park is fed by many rivers. There are a large number of interlinked canals, water ways and navigable lagoons and lakes that create plains of sediment carried by the river system. The plains are interspersed with rolling hills of forest that were created in ancient days from volcanic cinder cones, of which the Tortuguero Hill and the Lomas de Sierpe of height could be mentioned. Enforcement of protection has remained a challenge. Swaths of the park have been semi-legally clear-cut, the damage which allows access to habitat of endangered sea turtles. Fauna and flora Spectacled caiman in Tortuguero National Park. Bare-throated tiger heron in Tortuguero National Park. The national park’s wild life consists of birds, mammals, fungi, ferns, marine life, sea turtles, lakes and rainforest. Tortuguero National Park acts as a refuge to many of these species which are also found in the La Selva Biological Station and Braulio Carrillo National Park. Threatened animals species in the reserve area are: the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), marine turtles such as Chelonia mydas and Dermochelys coriacea, the manatee or sea cow (Trichechus manatus) (the northeastern Caribbean wetland is its local feeding and reproduction area) and the tropical gar (Atractosteus tropicus) a living fossil brought under protection by Costa Rican legislation. The park is a breeding ground along the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica for many of the main fishes used in subsistence fishing. =Fauna= The coastal zone, which has a long beach extending to nearly , is the nesting ground for turtles popularly known as the \\"beach- nesting turtles (tortugas)\\". They are found on the beaches, and also many of these species are reported from the canal banks. The main species to lay eggs during the winter months of February to July are: hawksbill, loggerheads, green, and leatherbacks. The rivers are home to sensitive populations of manatees, as well as caimans, crocodiles, and tropical gar. The forests are home to at least four Costa Rican cat species: jaguars (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi) and puma (Puma concolor), and three of Costa Rica's four species of monkey: Geoffroy's spider monkey, the mantled howler, and the white-headed capuchin. Other mammals include three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus), paca (Agouti paca), peccary (Tayassu pecari), tapir (Tapirus bairdii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) and 375 species of birds inhabit the area, including kingfishers, toucans, great blue herons and parrots. Neotropical migratory birds fly through this park, a noted bird species which is the crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis), which is the second largest bird of prey. An endangered species is the great green macaw (Ara ambiguus). 134 species of migratory birds have been recorded. The park is a migratory stopover for nearly one million birds annually. As of 1976 54 freshwater fish and 84 marine species are recorded for the area. Another source gives 30 species of freshwater fish. Some families of marine and freshwater fish reported are: The Cichlidae, Characidae, Pimelodidae, Carcharhinidae, Centropomidae, and Lutjanidae. Species include the bobo mullet (Joturus pichardi), which breeds in the estuaries but migrates upriver. Other species include eel, the bull shark (Carcharinus leucas), tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), snook (Centropomus parallelus) and tropical gar (Atractosteus tropicus). As of 1995 only a single species of freshwater mollusc had been recovered from the park, a small bivalve identified as either Mytilopsis guianensis or M. sellei, but a minimum of 10 species was estimated in 1995. and a variety of crustaceans are found here. Two important crustaceans are the shrimp Macrobrachium carcinus and M. tenellum which are fished for in and around the park by local inhabitants of the towns surrounding the area. 54 species of amphibians and 110 species of reptiles are known from here. Seven species of land turtles are known from here. Reptiles and amphibians reported are: Caiman crocodilus, Crocodylus acutus, basilisk lizards, Chrysemys spp., Rhinoclemmys spp., poison-dart frogs (Dendrobatidae), and many endemic species of salamanders. =Flora= Palm forests in the park As of 2006, the known flora is represented by 779 species, of which 36 are endemic to the country. According to other sources the national park ecosystem has more than 400 species of trees and about 2,200 species of other plants. The wet lowland Atlantic slopes (mostly below ) of northern Costa Rica, particularly along the coast, form into mangrove forests. The forests in this region consist of the gavilán (Pentaclethra macroloba), caobilla (Carapa nicaraguensis), the almendro (Dipteryx oleifera) and the monkey pot tree (Lecythis ampla); the last two species (regional endemics of the lowlands found below ) are stated to be nearly endangered. While 99% of mangrove forests are reported from the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica, only 1% is found in the Caribbean part of the park. Lakes, marshes and floodplains areas in the park have reported palms such as: Raphia taedigera and Manicaria saccifera, and floating aquatic plants in the streams such as the Azolla, Eichhornia, Hydrocotyle and Salvinia, which fully cover the streams during the dry season. There are trees including Dipteryx oleifera, Protium spp., Vatairea spp., Inga spp., Pterocarpus officinalis, Pachira aquatica, Luehea seemannii and Pentaclethra macroloba, with thick and varied undergrowth, and several species of small palms such as Euterpe precatoria. Other important plant species are grasses such as Paspalum spp. and the invasive pasture grass Brachiaria mutica. Trees native to the forests upland to the southwest are Apeiba tibourbou, Astronium graveolens, Brosimum alicastrum, Carapa guianensis, Cordia alliodora, Crescentia cujete, Croton niveus, Dipterix oleifera, Ficus insipida, Hura crepitans, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Jacaratia spinosa, Lecointea amazonica, Manilkara zapota, Spondias mombin, Virola sebifera and Zigia longifolia. Uses Tortuguero National Park is surrounded by private property consisting of large areas under cattle ranching and agricultural farming. The park area itself does not have any permanent human settlement though settlement was reported during the early part of the twentieth century when timber logging, turtle hunting, and collecting and selling skins of large mammals and reptiles were the major activities. The local inhabitants around the park are only permitted to collect forest products to supplement their income and also for domestic use. Fishing and tourism are major activities. Regulated guidance to visitors to access creeks, lakes, nature tails and watching wildlife and also for observing egg-laying by the turtles Chelonia mydas and Dermochelys coriacea. Training workshops as part of environmental education are organized by the park administration (ACTo) on aspects of conservation measures. Even though no research activities are conducted in the park, several institutions are involved in conducting surveys on sea turtles, birds, flora and insects, land tenure and use, and related economic development, there are some guard stations and protection points built within the park. El Gavilan Trail through Tortuguero National Park Regulations for the public use of the Tortuguero National Park provides allowance for public visitation under the specific regulations formulated. The park entrance is accessible from the Cuatro Esquinas center in the village of Tortuguero, in the northern part of the park. A number of trails depart from this point — three aquatic trails and one hiking trail. The hiking trail is called the Gavilan Trail and is long. La Ceiba and La Bomba trails lead up to Tortuguero hill, to a tower which provides a scenic vista of the region. The Sector Jalova Station is further south near Jalova Lagoon and the town of Parismina. Aguas Frias Station is on the western edge close to the town of Cariari. The three water trails are the Harold which is the most popular, Mora, and Chiquero. Conservation Illegal clear-cuts within the park has created access for poachers to the once isolated second largest green sea turtle nesting beach in the world. Other threats are due to cutting of Manicaria spp. for use as roofing material, change of river course deforestation, siltation as a result of banana plantations and illegal hunting by outside agencies. The last named threat is most serious and the most affected species are: Agouti paca, Tayassu pecari, Tapirus bairdii, Odocoileus virginianus, Dasypus novemcinctus and marine turtles and their eggs. Some of the developmental activities reported to be directly affecting the park environment are; a hydroelectric project; the new international port of Barra del Parismina; and an interlinking project linking the canals to the Pacific and the Caribbean. Conservation measures proposed in the core area of the larger Tortuguero Conservation Area (Area de Conservación y Desarrollo Sostenible de Llanuras del Tortuguero, ACTo), which encompasses the Tortuguero National Park, the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge (40,315 ha), the Border Corridor Wildlife Refuge (11,092 ha), as well as a few other reserves. The National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC), a department of the Ministry for the Environment and Energy (MINAE), is the responsible for managing the project. In 1990-1992, conservation projects were undertaken with the initiative of the project the MINAE and the European Union (EU), and were implemented by IUCN. The project envisaged \\"the organisation of land use and agroforestry, conservation of aquatic resources, strengthening of social structures, facilitating research development, and protecting existing natural and cultural resources.\\" Gallery Image:Caiman crocodilus (Tortuguero).jpg Image:Artibeus sp.

This town is located at the feet of the Sierra de Callosa mountain range. Redovan is one of the Vega Baja (low fertile valley) villages of the southern Costa Blanca, Spain. Located in the Alicante province, on a sparsely vegetated plain at the foot of the Sierra Segura, approximately 7 km from Orihuela. Although the town was founded by the Moors during the Arab conquest (8th - 13th Centuries, there is evidence of much earlier settlements going back to pre-historic times. The town is well known for its ceramics and this tradition stretches back to the 3rd century BC from when various samples of ceramic work have been found with a very distinctive zig-zag pattern. There appear to have been settlements on some small elevations of land in the surrounding areas from the Neolithic Period up until Bronze Age. In the 2nd century BC there appears to have been several different cultures in the region, among them “the culture of Argar” more commonly found in Almeria (further south down the coast of Spain). The area has always attracted settlers mostly because of its importance in agriculture due largely to the basin being irrigated by the Segura river, though there have often problems as the area is prone to flooding. Redovan's early history is dominated by the Arabs (Moors) and there is little doubt that the name of the village is derived from the Arabic language, despite there being some confusion as to the actual origin of the name. Some say that name derives from a famous general of the Moorish King of Granada named Farax Ben Redvan (or Reduan) who invaded and plundered the village in 1331. Others refer to the “Book of Distributions” in Orihuela which mentions the name “Aben-Redvan” (“of the children of Reduan”) relating to a time much earlier than 1331. A 16th- century historian attributes the name to the family of Redouanes (of Moroccan origin) who were Moorish noblemen from Granada.Redovan and the whole area suffered a great pestilence in 1347 and this lasted until 1351 this ravaged the agriculture of the area and many of its residents re-settled in the city of Orihuela. During this time the town was often plundered by bandits and renegades. The plague hit again in 1374 and in 1383. Redovan and its people were also greatly affected by the constant wars between the Kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon. During the 17th Century Redovan enjoyed a period of improved wealth and prosperity due to successes in agriculture, important crops at the time being grapes, vegetables, wheat, olives and the mulberry (silk became an important product of the town. Redovan was seriously damaged by the disastrous earthquake of 1829 and there a great loss of life. In 1847 Redovan had 160 houses and 1,591 inhabitants, its industry consisted of “5 mills and some looms”. Modern day Redovan is a busy town of around 5,600 people, it is noted for the production of cotton, hemp and hemp products, espadrilles and the formerly mentioned ceramics. During the latter part of September there is an exhibition of hemp products in the town dedicated to the patron saint of the village, St Michael. It's also a popular location for potholers as there are many caves in the area suitable for this more modern pursuit. Redovan has numerous bars, restaurants and shops, centred on its village square where many celebrations, fiestas and festivities take place. Redovan is readily accessible via the N-340 and the A-7 motorway, it is approximately 52 km from Alicante and its international airport at El Altet (Alicante).

Life Kreeta Järvilä was born 13 November 1813 in Kaustby parish in Järvilä village as the youngest of a family of five. Her parents were known as Jaakko Matinpoika Järvilä and Liisa Eliasentytär Björn (Jacob Mattsson Järvilä and Elisabet Eliasdotter Björn). Her maternal grandfather, Elias Mattsson Björn was a soldier with a talent for music. Haapasalo's musical training began at six years of age with a 6-stringed kantele under the guidance of her uncle Vanhatalo Juho (Gammalgården), who played both violin and a \\"large, black kantele\\". As a child, she would sit and listen as he played his kantele. She also played the violin in the beginning but quit later. When she became older, her brother made her a bigger instrument of alder with wooden screws. As a 13-year-old Haapasalo moved in with her sister and husband where she helped with the farm work; she stayed with them five years. During this time she travelled from house to house sewing, working on farms during the summer and sewing in the winter. As an 18-year-old she moved back to her parents and worked as a seamstress. Her musical interest was concentrated on practicing on the kantele. Nothing was mentioned about Haapasalo's singing, but she said in 1890: \\"When I was young I did not sing, but when sorrow and distress came as an adult, then I first burst out in song.\\" Kreeta Järvilä was married 24 June 1837 (in full attire with a large crown) to farmer's son Joonas Tanelinpoika Huntus, (Jonas Danielsson Wirkkala), born 13 April 1814 in Kaustby, died 20 May 1890 at Varkaus. The couple had eleven children. As newlyweds, the young couple stayed in Joonas' home, but after a short time they got a little croft near his parents. They had not settled themselves before they moved to Haapasalo's home. After some years they went to Kelviå as crofters. Restlessness led them to a crofter's holding at Haga at Vetil parsonage. They went to Luoma farm the following year, and in 1850 the family moved to Haapasalo, to the side of the village that borders on Halsua, the crown residence. From that time Haapasalo began to use the name Haapasalo at the initiative of Zachris Topelius in 1853. The stay at Haapasalo was not of long duration, until they moved back to Haga croft, then to Kritilä croft at the parsonage. Career as a musician Her husband's inability to work regularly was the biggest cause of the many moves. During the famine of 1867-68 Haapasalo was often forced to go on singing trips. \\"Lapseni minun kotia huonolle hoidolle jäi. kun pitkin mailman turuja mun täytyy kulkia näin.\\" (My children left in a corner of the home with poor care while I have to sing and gather my bread from farm to farm.) comes from one of her songs. She began her appearances in the nearest city of Gamlakarleby in 1853, where one afternoon she received 10 rubles. At one house Captain Langenskjöld encouraged her to give a concert in Helsingfors and gave her a letter of recommendation. She received 275 rubles on her journey through the southern cities; most of the money came in Helsingfors. People showed genuine and pure kindness as Haapasalo was so new and overwhelming that from 1853 the media of that time could not be more attentive. People followed her journeys with sympathy and were pleased with her success. In the newspapers of the time one can gather many accounts of the singing and kantele playing at the appearances of the Osterbottniska farmer's wife. While in Helsingfors, she gave her letters of recommendation to writer and poet Zachris Topelius. When he asked her surname, she replied that she had none. She was known as Kreeta Jacobsdotter, but he felt she should have a surname. The house she was living in at that time was known as Haapasalo, so Topelius advised her to call herself Kreeta Haapasalo. Kantele Haapasalo's songs, which she always sang, accompanied her for 40 years in the homes, in schools, at large and small festivals, at concerts, at agricultural shows, at restaurants and at markets. In 1869 they bought a home at Kalliokoski in Halsua where they stayed four years. Johan L. Runeberg arranged a party for her appearance in Borgå. One time she performed at the royal theater in Stockholm. This was arranged by Swedish poet Emil Van Qvanten. She also performed several times in the auditorium of the nobility in Saint Petersburg (Russia). The family's daughter Fia often followed her mother on trips because she also was a gifted singer and played the kantele. She married at Leppävirta and Haapasalo and Joonas with the children Matti and Matilda moved to a rented house in Varkaus. After her husband's death 20 May 1890, Haapasalo moved for the last time. Daughter Fia's family moved to Jyväskylä and Haapasalo followed. She died 29 Mar 1893 and was buried there. In 1899 the Society of Young Finns placed a granite stone on her grave. Haapasalo's extensive repertory was mostly spiritual songs, folk dances, ballads as well as her own songs, which often emphasized sorrow. One time when she returned from a trip she heard that two of her children were to be buried that day. She arrived at the cemetery to hear that an epidemic had taken two of her children. Court artist R. W. Ekman has immortalized her on three canvases. The most well-known picture of her is one by Arvid Liljelund in Tusby - a painted portrait where Haapasalo stands at a window singing and playing as one of her small grandsons sits and listens. =Legacy= Aleksis Kivi mentioned her in his poem Anjanpellon markkivat: \\"Vaimo vakaa Pohjanmaalta soitti kanteleella lempiäll.\\" (The serious woman from Österbotten played her beautiful kantele.) In 1954 a statue was erected in her memory in Kaustby with Ilmari Wirkkala as a prime sponsor. Another monument was erected at her homeplace in Veteli. In the early 1990s Finland honored her and five other women on postage stamps. References Sources *Anneli Asplund: Haapasalo, Kreta (1813–1893) Kansallisbiografia-e . 14.3.2000.

Career outline Edmund Charles Smith Richards was born on 6 October 1889. After joining the colonial service, he rose steadily through the ranks, becoming a district commissioner in 1923, assistant secretary for native affairs in 1927, deputy provincial commissioner in 1928, provincial commissioner in 1931, deputy chief secretary in 1934, acting chief secretary in 1934 and resident commissioner, Basutoland from 1935 to 1942. Richards became Governor of Nyasaland in August 1942, retiring in March 1947. He died in 1955. Central African Council A Central African Council was created in 1945 to coordinate research activities, economic policies and the transport and communication systems of Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia. Richards saw no particular value to Nyasaland in the council. Sir Stewart Gore-Browne of Northern Rhodesia objected to the name since no Africans were represented. Talking of the first session, Gore- Browne described Richards as an \\"ill-mannered oaf\\". The key topic discussed by the council was that of recruitment and treatment of Native labor. Nyasaland was the main supplier of non-indigenous African laborers to Southern Rhodesia. The main debate was between Richards and the prime minister of Southern Rhodesia, Godfrey Huggins. Although the council had no power to make a decision on the subject, the two men both freely aired their views. Richards was initially hostile to the idea of establishing joint services to serve the three colonies, but later came round to the idea of extending services such as Civil Aviation and the Court of Appeal from Southern Rhodesia to also cover the northern territories. Other Nyasaland issues One of the issues Richards had to deal with was that of education of the Africans. In 1945, Richards received a memorandum from the newly formed Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) saying the members disliked sending their boys to the college at Makerere in Uganda \\"because the standard of education attained is lower than that attained in South African Schools...\\". The age limit system was also an issue with primary education. Under this system, children could not enroll if they were too old, and without birth certifications they were subject to arbitrary estimates of whether they were young enough to attend school. Girls suffered in particular when they were unable to start education early for reasons that were out of their control. Richards did nothing to resolve the problem, but supported age limits. On 15 February 1946, Richards sent proposals to the Colonial Office to change the method of selecting members of the legislative council. These included introducing elections for the European \\"unofficial\\" members (members other than civil servants), and giving the unofficial members the majority.

A month later, Damian's younger sister Jayne was born. In June 1983, Trevor brought Damian to Weatherfield to stay with Stan and Hilda while he went to Chester for a job interview. The Ogdens were pleased to have Damian although Stan suspected Trevor had a hidden agenda as they'd recently received an inheritance from Hilda's brother, Archie Crabtree (John Stratton). Hilda hoped Stan was wrong but Trevor did indeed ask for a loan the next day, which Hilda refused. In October 1986, Hilda was drafted in again when Trevor and Polly went on holiday for two weeks Curly Watts Terry Duckworth Percy Sugden Percy Sugden played by Bill Waddington. He appeared between 1983 and 1997. The character was introduced to Coronation Street as a potential caretaker of the Community Centre. Percy's niece, Elaine Prior, stayed with him until she married Bill Webster (Peter Armitage). Percy was also a school traffic warden, and Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers) came to respect him greatly after he was injured trying to protect her. Kevin Webster Kevin John Webster is a fictional character in the UK television ITV soap opera, Coronation Street. Portrayed by actor Michael Le Vell, the character first appeared onscreen during the episode airing on 19 October 1983. Le Vell was suspended from the soap in 2013 due to allegations of sexual offences, with scenes he had already filmed cut from broadcast. Le Vell was found not guilty of all charges in September 2013, and briefly returned in early 2014, before taking another 3-month break from the show and returning once again. Mark Redman Mark Redman (also Dunlop) made his first appearance on 31 October 1983. He is the son of long-running character Mike Baldwin and Maggie Dunlop. He was played by Thomas Hawkeswood from 1983 till 1984, by Christopher Oakes in 1986, Michael Bolstridge in 1991 and then by Christopher Cook from 1992 till 1996 and then most recently Paul Fox from 1999 till 2006. He first appeared during the episode airing on 31 October 1983 and last appeared on 17 April 2006. Maggie married Harry Redman soon after splitting up with Mike and Harry brought up Mark as his son. Mike found out about Mark after Harry's death and he started interfering with Mark's and his mother's lives, paying for Mark to go to Oakhill Grammar School and alienating him from his old friends. Mark was relieved to move to Felixstowe when his mother remarried. After leaving school, Mark returned to Weatherfield in 1999 to see his father and stayed for a while, helping out in the factory, but fell in love with Mike's fiancée, Linda Sykes. They began an affair in the new year and both became partners in the company. Mark tried to make it work but it was too much and he eventually decided to leave Weatherfield again, for Amsterdam, agreeing to return for the wedding. When he did, the secret came out on the wedding day and Mike was furious. He told Mark to leave and never come back. While things went on to be slightly friendlier between them, their relationship never entirely recovered and Mark moved to Holland soon after. By 2006, Mark was living with his girlfriend in Doncaster and estranged from his father. He was shocked to find a confused Mike on his doorstep, unaware that his father now had Alzheimer's disease. Mike initially believed Mark to be his youngest son, Mike later remembered that Adam Barlow was his youngest son, but upon remembering Mark's affair with Linda, he left. Later that week, Mike died of a heart attack and Mark attended his funeral from a distance. Afterwards, he visited the factory and introduced himself to Adam. When Adam explained that Mike's older son Danny Baldwin had used Mike's illness to get him to leave him everything in his will, Mark urged Adam to contest it.

Suzie Birchall Suzanne \\"Suzie\\" Goodwin (née Birchall) was played by actress Cheryl Murray from January 1977 to December 1979 and then again in 1983. Suzie was a cynical peroxide blonde teenager who was more interested in having fun than being responsible. She made fast friends with Gail Potter and shared a room with her at Elsie Tanner's house. Her first storyline involved her getting her foot stuck through Hilda Ogden's ceiling. Her father Bob was a control freak and he came to take her home. When he tried to take her by force, Steve Fisher intervened, getting a punch in the face before Bob washed his hands of his daughter and drove off alone. She later kept company with a sugar daddy and found fleeting romance, which was her ticket out of the Street. Off-screen, she married Terry Goodwin but the marriage soon soured when it was revealed that Goodwin abused her, leading to her return to Weatherfield in early 1983. She moved back in with Elsie and as soon as she filed for divorce, went back to her old fun-loving ways. After Suzie tried to seduce Gail's husband, Brian Tilsley, Elsie threw her out and she left the Street again, and this time for good. Tracy Barlow  Sam Littlewood Sam Littlewood was Rita Littlewood's uncle on her on her father Harold's side. Sam was a former wheelwright and was then a scrap-metal dealer. In 1977, he gave Rita away when she married Len Fairclough. In his short but concise speech as father of the bride, Sam gave his blessing to the union, and went on to drink everyone under the table at the reception. He later retired to Blackpool from Blackburn, and it was here that Rita turned to him when she walked out on Len in 1980. Despairing of them both, Sam forced Len to go to Blackpool and plead to Rita to return to Coronation Street with him. 1977 *, Coronation Street Coronation Street ","title":"List of Coronation Street characters (1977)"},{"id":"31192136","text":"In 1974, several new characters were added to the British television soap opera Coronation Street. Some of them only appeared for a few episodes, but Gail Potter (later Gail McIntyre) became one of the show's longest-running characters. Sir Julius Berlin Sir Julius Berlin was played by Leonard Sachs. Sir Julius appeared in Coronation Street during 1974 as the boss of the Mark Brittain mail order warehouse that was situated in the Street. When the residents complained about the lorries passing through, Ken Barlow spoke to Sir Julius about the problem. Sir Julius was so impressed by Ken that he offered him a job as executive administrative assistant. Meanwhile, the workers at the warehouse threatened to strike due to Sir Julius trying to keep his staff out of a trade union, until Ken persuaded Sir Julius to accept the union. Sir Julius upset workers Ivy Tilsley and Vera Duckworth because the company announced all women over sixty had to retire. They called the union in but the union supported lowering the retirement age. After the warehouse fire in 1975, Sir Julius (who had not appeared since May 1974) dissolved the company. Martin Downes Martin Andrew Downes (also Lynch) is the son of Bet Lynch whom she gave up for adoption when she was 16. One day Martin arrives at the Rovers knowing his mother is a barmaid who works there, and soon realizes she is Bet. However he is repulsed by her overt sexual nature and leaves without telling her who he is. Nine months later, Bet receives news from one of Martin's army colleagues that he has died in action in Ulster. The news devastated her and she briefly considered suicide, but was talked out of it by Eddie Yeats. Idris Hopkins Idris Hopkins, his wife Vera and their daughter Tricia moved to Coronation Street to take over the tenancy of the Corner Shop in 1974. Idris, a Welshman, was a quiet man, satisfied with what life had thrown at him. Weary of working night shifts, and of the noise in Coronation Street, Idris frequently had to make peace between Vera and his domineering mother Megan, who moved into the Corner Shop accommodation with Idris and Vera. Idris was never as involved with the grand plans of the family as Vera or (especially) Granny Hopkins. He spent most of his time slumped in his chair or working nights. He barely registered the trouble Granny was giving shop owner Gordon Clegg and his mother Betty Turpin, but when he found out he tried to exclude her from the family's plans to buy the shop from Gordon. When Granny persisted, hoping to buy the shop for a cheaper price, Gordon evicted the family, and they disappeared during the night, never to be seen in Coronation Street again (except for Tricia). Gail Platt Vera Duckworth Vera Duckworth (also Burton), played by Liz Dawn, first appearing in August 1974 and last appearing in the 6,734th episode on 18 January 2008, where the character peacefully died in her sleep at the age of 70 from heart failure. Her funeral was held on 22 January 2008. She reappeared posthumously for a single appearance on the 8 November 2010 episode, in which her husband Jack (Bill Tarmey) died. Blanche Hunt Blanche Hunt (née Linfield) was originally played by Patricia Cutts; however, the actress committed suicide after appearing in just two episodes in 1974.

Archie Crabtree Archie Crabtree (played by John Stratton) was the brother of Hilda Ogden. Archie came to Coronation Street in May 1972 to look after Hilda while Stan was in hospital recovering from an accident on the lorries. With his beer belly and laziness, Archie could more easily pass as a brother of Stan than of Hilda, and for three weeks he filled Stan's void in Hilda's life. Archie arrived on the scene just as Hilda decided to give No.13 a facelift which would give it pride of place in the Street. Together, they settled on a porch, complete with hanging baskets. Archie built the porch for Hilda and finished it in less than a week, but there was a last minute snag: planning permission, as Jerry Booth reminded them as they proudly admired their handiwork. Archie went to the Town Hall to sort it out but was unsuccessful and Hilda was told by Councillor Warburton to take the porch down. Shortly after this, the porch disappeared and believing that the council would not just take it, Hilda decided it must have been stolen. However, Archie never got the chance to make good on his threat to turn the thief into mincemeat as shortly thereafter, Hilda received a telegram from the hospital revealing that Stan was on his way home and hence Archie would have to go. Archie suggested that Hilda take another job so that she could look after him and Stan, but one Stan was enough for Hilda. Despite his belief that a working man was finished by the time he was fifty, Archie went on to see better days. He married Doris some time after his visit to No.13 and by the 1980s owned Crabtree's Chip Shop. Hilda went to stay with Archie in 1973 and in 1981, at which point he had just moved into a new, bigger house, and again in 1982. By 1983, Archie was a widower and not in the best of health. On 16 May of that year, he died of a heart attack. The shop was left to Hilda as Archie's only surviving family and Hilda dealt with the funeral arrangements and had Archie cremated. After Archie's death, there was some question over the nature of his relationship with his assistant Avril Carter, who claimed to be Archie's fiancée and that with his dying breath, he had expressed his desire for her to have the chip shop. Hilda battled Avril for the shop and found that she was having an affair with a married man and said this would be exposed in court, forcing her to back down. Sadly, due to Archie's debts, Hilda's inheritance amounted to £2,000. Norma Ford Norma Ford was played by Diana Davies. Norma moved to the street in 1972 and got a job as Maggie Clegg's assistant in the Corner Shop. In 1973, she embarked on a relationship with Ken Barlow, but it did not last long, as he eventually left her for Janet Reid. Shortly after Ken and Janet's wedding, Norma left the area. She came back briefly in 1974 for Maggie's wedding to businessman Ron Cooke and left again after the ceremony.

It also includes the description of about 300 specific DNA binding sites for more than a hundred characterized TFs. Further information about each Yeast gene has been extracted from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). For each gene the associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms and their hierarchy in GO was obtained from the GO consortium. Currently, YEASTRACT maintains more than 7100 terms from GO. The nucleotide sequences of the promoter and coding regions for Yeast genes were obtained from Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT). All the information in YEASTRACT is updated regularly to match the latest data from SGD, GO consortium, RSA Tools and recent literature on yeast regulatory networks. YEASTRACT includes DISCOVERER, a set of tools that can be used to identify complex motifs found to be over-represented in the promoter regions of co- regulated genes. DISCOVERER is based on the MUSA algorithm. These algorithms take as input a list of genes and identify over-represented motifs, which can then be compared with transcription factor binding sites described in the YEASTRACT database. Facilities are also provided to enable the exploitation of the gathered data when solving a number of biological questions, as exemplified in the Tutorial. YEASTRACT allows the identification of documented or potential transcription regulators of a given gene and of documented or potential regulons for each transcription factor. It also renders possible the comparison between DNA motifs and the transcription factor binding sites described in the literature.

The following is a list of characters that appeared in 1973, by order of first appearance. All characters were introduced by then series producer H. V. Kershaw. May saw the first appearance of Faye-Marie Schofield. Elaine Perkins was introduced in July. Two months later, Vera Hopkins and Tricia Hopkins arrived. While Polly Ogden made her debut in December. Armistead Caldwell Armistead Caldwell is the late husband of Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant). He \\"appears\\" only in a voice appearance, in which he is portrayed by David Casey. A soft and gentle man, Armistead and Minnie were deeply in love throughout their brief marriage. However, this was not always the case; in 1919, during a trip to Marple Lake, Minnie left Armistead behind to walk, and he turned to Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) to advice. He fell for Ena, mainly attracted by her upfront plain speaking, a quality that Minnie did not have. He even went as far to write Ena a love letter, but Ena told Armistead to go back to Minnie, as they were meant to be. He obeyed, and Armistead married Minnie in 1925, dying ten years later. However, in 1973, Minnie was most upset when she found said letter while cleaning Ena's flat, in preparation for Ena returning from holiday. Minnie is subsequently cold with Ena, snubbing her twice in the Rovers Return Inn. Concerned, Ena asks Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss), Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), Rita Littlewood (Barbara Mullaney) and Norma Ford (Diana Davies) how Minnie has been behaving recently, but gets no solid response. Minnie refuses to tell Ena, her biggest hint being asking Ena if she has done anything to stop herself going to Heaven. After concerned neighbour Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) enquired about Minnie's despondence, Minnie showed Emily the letter and broke down in tears, under the impression that Armistead and Ena had had an affair. Emily persuades Ena and Minnie to talk, and Ena assures her friend that she was little more than a shoulder to cry on. Minnie accepts this and agrees to put their differences aside. However, once they have left Minnie's house, Ena confides to Emily that Armistead's intentions were far more serious than she had let on; Emily agrees to keep quiet, and Minnie never finds out. Faye-Marie Schofield Faye-Marie Schofield, played by Jane Casson, made her first screen appearance on 14 May 1973. Faye-Marie is the wife of Tom Scofield, a nephew of Ena Sharples. She visits Weatherfield along with her husband to inform Ena that her brother, Tom's father, had recently died in his sleep. They then accompany some residents of Coronation Street to Woburn Abbey, much to Ena's delight. Elaine Perkins Elaine Perkins, played by Joanna Lumley, made her first screen appearance on 23 July 1973. Lumley was contracted to appear for eight episodes as a love interest for Ken Barlow (William Roache). She had hoped the role would lead to a longer stint, but producers had other plans for Ken. In 2009, Lumley almost reprised the role as part of a storyline that saw Ken have an affair. However, she was too busy filming on another project at the time and Stephanie Beacham was cast as Ken's lover Martha Fraser instead. Elaine meets Ken Barlow at a party for the teaching staff of Bessie Street School. Her father, Wilfred Perkins (Wensley Pithey), introduces them to each other and they bond over their political views, despite the age gap. Elaine and Ken meet up several times as friends, but Ken soon develops feelings for her and becomes jealous of her friendships with other men. Ken tells Elaine that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him, but she turns down his proposal. A writer for What's on TV branded Elaine a \\"posh girl\\". Tricia Hopkins Patricia \\"Tricia\\" Hopkins, played by Kathy Jones, made her first screen appearance on 24 September 1973. Patricia is the daughter of Idris and Vera Hopkins (Kathy Staff) and the granddaughter of Cledwin and Megan Hopkins. She first appeared in September 1973 when she was being chatted up by Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) and was eventually caught by Vera drinking in The Rovers Return. Tricia appeared in Coronation Street again in 1974, when her grandmother Megan Hopkins viewed the Corner Shop with an interest in buying it. Tricia got a job in the Mark Brittain Warehouse across the Street and lived in the Corner Shop flat, while her Granny ran the shop with Vera and Idris, and lived in the shop accommodation below the flat. Tricia's first few months in the Street were spent trying to get Ray to notice her. Her friend Gail Potter (Helen Worth) was keen to match-make the pair, and took a polaroid just as Ray kissed Tricia. The picture was found by Granny Hopkins, who locked Tricia in her room and subjected her to a moral preaching. Idris warned Ray away from Tricia, but Ray told him there was not any relationship to speak of, except Tricia's wishful thinking. Her main priority being to enjoy her youth, Tricia did not concern herself with her family's problems, and bemoaned the fact that despite having her own flat, she was still under their thumb. When the rest of the family left the Street after a failed attempt to blackmail shop owner Gordon Clegg (Bill Kenwright), Tricia returned to Coronation Street and convinced Gordon to rent the flat to her and Gail, with Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) taking over the running of the shop. Tricia fancied herself as a man-eater, but was not interested in anything serious. She was sometimes cheeky to the older residents of the Street, who saw her as opinionated, with an especially high opinion of herself. In 1975, when a cigarette caused the warehouse to burn down, Tricia was trapped in a toilet and rescued by Ken Barlow (William Roache). She and Gail were able to convince the Langtons to let them stay with them until the street residents were allowed to return to their homes. While jobless, the pair joined a modelling course, and became agents for the Weatherfield Heating Bureau before settling into work in the Shop. Tricia had some high ambitions - she played Cinderella in the street's play in the Community Centre and her performance was praised in the local newspaper, although nothing came of it. When Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) returned to the Street to manage Sylvia's Separates, Tricia and Gail both asked her for the assistant's job. Elsie took on Tricia, but she and Gail decided to toss a coin to decide, and Gail won, leaving Tricia in the Corner Shop, but only a short time later Renee Bradshaw (Madge Hindle) bought the Shop from Gordon and Tricia lost her job. She was willing to let Tricia stay on in the flat, but Tricia was sick of Renee already and told her she could stick her job and her flat, and returned to her family. In 2019, 43 years later Gail later visited her after leaving Thailand before going back home. Vera Hopkins Vera Hopkins, played by Kathy Staff, made her first screen appearance on 26 September 1973. Vera is the mother of Tricia Hopkins (Kathy Jones). Vera had married into the Welsh Hopkins family. The Hopkinses were close, with Vera and her husband Idris keeping a close eye on Tricia and Idris's mother Megan keeping an even closer eye on them. In 1973, Vera caught Tricia drinking underage in The Rovers Return, and rowed with landlady Annie Walker for allowing it. Annie gave Vera a dressing down for not knowing what her daughter got up to, and barred the Hopkinses from the pub. The Hopkinses returned to Coronation Street in 1974 with an interest in buying the Corner Shop. Vera did not stay long though as only a few weeks later she left to take care of her sick mother, only returning when she died a few months later. Granny Hopkins was interested in buying the shop using Vera's inheritance, but the pair did not get along and when the pair were moving furniture in the corner shop accommodation and found owner Gordon Clegg's (Bill Kenwright) birth certificate, Vera assured Betty Turpin (Betty Driver) that they would not tell anyone that it revealed that she was Gordon's true mother, not Maggie Cooke (Irene Sutcliffe). Vera knew that Granny could not be trusted, and tried to rein her in as she used the information to try to secure a lower price on the shop from seller Gordon. Vera and Idris excluded her from the acquisition of the shop, keen to make peace with the Cleggs, but Granny sent Gordon a letter telling him the truth anyway, causing him to change his mind about the sale. The Hopkinses promptly left the Street, with Vera and Idris too ashamed to return, and Granny too defiant. Polly Ogden Pauline \\"Polly\\" Ogden (also Watson), played by Mary Tamm, made her first screen appearance on 17 December 1973. Polly is the wife of Trevor Ogden (Don Hawkins) and the mother of Damian (Neil Ratcliffe) and Jayne Ogden. Polly met Trevor when he had a cyst operation carried out in a hospital where Polly worked as a nurse. Since leaving Weatherfield aged fifteen in 1964, Trevor had worked his way into the building trade and cut virtually all ties with his northern roots; when he married Polly in 1971, he told her his parents were dead, although he did write a letter to Stan (Bernard Youens) and Hilda (Jean Alexander) that year before marrying, which he thought they'd ignored as he never received the reply they sent. In 1973, Polly gave birth to a son, Damian. Later, just before Christmas, Polly answered the door to Stan and Hilda, who had tracked Trevor down to Chesterfield as they wanted in the year to reconnect with him after nine years. The initial exchanges were awkward as the elder Ogdens did not know that Trevor had married or that they were grandparents, while Polly was interested in why Trevor had written them off but did not want Stan and Hilda to know he had. When Trevor arrived home, he was not happy to see his parents but he was polite with them, although he was visibly embarrassed at the reminder of the working class community he'd abandoned. When alone with Polly, Trevor was more vocal, warning her that if they let Stan and Hilda into their lives they'd never be rid of them. Polly admitted that she did not like them much either but that she wanted to invite them to stay the night as it was getting late, but Trevor was against this and rushed them out of the house before their dinner guests arrived. There was friction between father and son as Stan was very aware that Trevor was only tolerating them, and Trevor blamed Stan for his failings as a child. This was exacerbated when Polly let slip that she'd been told Hilda and Stan were dead, and they left shortly thereafter. Polly never visited Stan and Hilda in Weatherfield but Trevor paid occasional visits, usually when he wanted something. In December 1975, while pregnant with their second child, Polly was admitted to hospital for toxaemia. Trevor asked Hilda to live in his house in Chesterfield and look after Damian for a month as he was working. Hilda was hurt that Trevor had broken his silence to ask her to skivvy for him but went to Chesterfield anyway. In January 1976, Polly gave birth to a daughter, Jayne. When Stan died in 1984, Polly, unlike Trevor, does not got to Stan's funeral. In October 1986, Hilda was drafted in again when Trevor and Polly went on holiday for two weeks without the kids. Neither Polly nor Trevor have been heard from again.

Created by writer Tony Warren, Coronation Street first broadcast on ITV on 9 December 1960. The following is a list of characters introduced in the show's twelfth year, by order of first appearance. Ivy Tilsley Ivy Joan Tilsley (née Nelson; previously Brennan) was played by Lynne Perrie. She was originally credited as Ivy Tyldesley. Ivy worked as a machinist at Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) factory, and was elevated to supervisor. Her best friend was Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn). In the 1975 episode where the factory was burnt down, Ivy mentions that she is childless and her husband's name is \\"Jack\\"; before that, her husband was called \\"Wilf Tyldesley\\", and before that \\"Arthur\\". Jack himself made two appearances in 1975. By the time she became a street resident and a more regular character, her husband was named \\"Bert\\" and they had an adult son, Brian (Christopher Quinten).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5T5S-ber_g Ivy's storylines have included her feud with daughter-in-law Gail Tilsley (Helen Worth), losing her husband and son and her relationship with Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff). Edna Gee Edna Gee was played by Mavis Rogerson. Edna first appeared in 1971 working at the Mark Brittain mail order warehouse. Edna was the first wife of Fred Gee. Edna was well known in Weatherfield as being a bit of a flirt. In 1973 she attended Hilda Ogden's (Jean Alexander) birthday party and flirted with Ray Langton (Neville Buswell), but ended up in the Ogdens' bedroom with Billy Walker (Ken Farrington). Hilda thought Edna was in the room with Stan. Edna also enjoyed a gossip and along with workmate Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie) started spreading rumours that Elsie Tanner's (Pat Phoenix) husband Alan Howard (Alan Browning) was having an affair. Her other workmates included Elsie, Ken Barlow (William Roache), Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire), Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn), Gail Potter (Helen Worth) and Tricia Hopkins (Kathy Jones). She attended Emily's wedding to Ernest Bishop (Stephen Hancock) in 1972. In October 1975, Edna celebrated her 40th birthday with Fred in The Rovers Return. The next day Edna was found dead in the warehouse fire, Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson) broke the news to all her friends and workmates. Mavis Wilton Mavis Wilton (née Riley) played by Thelma Barlow. A long- running series regular, Mavis appeared in the show for 26 years from 1971 to 1997. Introduced for a one-off cameo appearance, she proved popular with producers and viewers and subsequently became a regular. Mavis was portrayed as moralising, repressed, and dithering, and often appeared in comic scenes with her boss Rita Sullivan or her husband Derek Wilton. She was generally well received by critics, described as a national institution and one of Coronation Street's best loved characters, an old-fashioned spinster. Barlow has been praised for her portrayal of Mavis, a character notably spoofed by impressionist Les Dennis during the 1980s. Barlow decided to leave Coronation Street in 1997; her character left to run a guest house in Cartmel following the death of her husband. Barlow has said that the producers of Coronation Street repeatedly asked her to return as Mavis, but she declined. Laura Howard Laura Howard was the first wife of Alan Howard. Their son Mark was born in 1952. The marriage was over by 1969 when Alan came to Weatherfield to oversee the salon he had just purchased. Alan briefly met Laura in 1971 when he was staying at a hotel in Leeds. She admitted that there were times when she missed him but he was honest and said he didn't feel the same way. The reason he gave for seeing her was to enquire after Mark who he was estranged from. By 1972 Laura had opened up her own salon in Harrogate and helped Alan financially in order for him to buy the Canal Garage. In August of the same year, Laura came to Coronation Street to tell Alan and Elsie Tanner that she was getting re-married and wanted to drop Alan's loan - although Elsie refused. Despite appearing in the programme, before her appearance dialogue in 1970 names Alan's first wife as Dorothea and later on Alan states that his wife was much younger than himself. The age difference once Stella Tanner had been cast eighteen months' later did not seem to be as great as implied.

It was built in 1858 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. History Initially, the building housed Clermont Presbyterian Church, which disbanded shortly afterward. with In 1863, the Presbytery and the Union Sunday School entered into an agreement whereby the latter could use the building as long as they were able to maintain it. Organized in 1857, Union was a non-denominational Sunday school for adults and children. Previously they had met in the home of Mrs. Edwin Stedman, the first of seven superintendents. The most prominent member of the Sunday school was William Larrabee, who spent 18 years in the Iowa Senate, and served two terms as Iowa's governor. He provided the pneumatic Kimball organ in 1896. His daughter Anna served as the church organist for over 60 years. The instrument, restored by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders in 2010, is still played in concerts. The Sunday school was known throughout the years for its Christmas program. From 1877, the building also housed Clermont's first lending library. The books were donated by the Larrabee family. A group of people in town wanted to start Protestant services, and beginning in 1933 the Rev. J.J. Snyder of Elgin, Iowa served as the first minister of what was known as the Union Church. In 1943 the congregation became Methodists. Union Sunday School dwindled in size and disbanded in 1963. At that time it was the oldest organization in continuous operation in Clermont. The Methodist congregation disbanded in 1966. The Presbytery of Northeast Iowa donated the building to the non-profit Historical Governor Larrabee Home in 1970.

The Center's researchers use randomized controlled trials and other rigorous forms of evaluation to promote sustainable social and economic development around the world. History and Mission CEGA was established in 2008 by Economics Professor Edward Miguel and colleagues at UC Berkeley. The Center’s founders, including Haas School of Business Professor Paul Gertler, are considered pioneers in the field of impact evaluation. They have led some of the most influential field experiments in recent years, including evaluations of school-based deworming in Kenya and of the Oportunidades program in Mexico. The Center is guided by the principle that economic policy and social programs should be based on scientific evidence. In support of this vision, CEGA researchers rigorously test anti-poverty strategies and disseminate their findings to governments and other decision-makers. The Center also invests in developing junior researchers in the U.S. and in low- and middle-income countries. CEGA is currently led by Faculty Director Edward Miguel and Executive Director Carson Christiano. Activities CEGA focuses its resources in three core areas: research, training and policy impact. The Center's research program draws on the empirical work of more than 100 faculty members at the University of California, Stanford University, and other West Coast academic institutions. These researchers are united in their use of rigorous statistical tools to measure the impacts of social programs in low and middle income countries. The CEGA toolbox includes randomized evaluation (long-trusted in the medical field) as well as regression discontinuity, panel analysis, instrumental variables, and other rigorous quasi-experimental methods. When used appropriately, each of these methods can create equivalent treatment and comparison groups for use in estimating an intervention's impact. CEGA is unique among development research centers, in that it integrates business and economic approaches with expertise from various sectors--including agriculture, engineering and computer science, public health, education, political science, and environment. It also maintains deep investments in cultivating research collaborators in developing countries, through programs like the East Africa Social Science Translation (EASST) Collaborative. Policy Impact To transform research into better policies and programs, CEGA encourages the scale-up of proven interventions. For example, CEGA researcher Edward Miguel, in collaboration with Michael Kremer, demonstrated in 2004 that school-based mass deworming in rural Kenya is a cost-effective way to improve school attendance. Subsequent advocacy by Kremer and Miguel led to the establishment of Deworm the World, a non-profit that works directly with governments to expand school-based deworming. The efforts of Deworm the World, together with Miguel's and Kremer’s research, have been instrumental in the creation of Kenya's national deworming program. In 2009, the program reached more than 3.6 million children at 8,200 schools across the country, making it one of the first evidence-based, national deworming programs in sub- Saharan Africa. Miguel's research on deworming has been covered by The New York Times, as well as The Boston Globe,http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~emiguel/pdfs/BostonGlobe_2010-07-16.pdf Chicago Tribunehttp://elsa.berkeley.edu/~emiguel/pdfs/Hookworm-Chicago- Tribune_04mar08.pdf and Financial Times.http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b07be4c8-986f-11e0-94d7-00144feab49a.html In May 2011, Miguel's and Kremer’s work was featured in a column by Nicholas Kristof on the importance of impact evaluation. Partners CEGA partners with governments, foundations and non-profit organizations to implement impact evaluations, trainings and research dissemination. In each of these areas, the Center works closely with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA). CEGA and J-PAL jointly manage the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative, an initiative that seeks to improve the appropriate adoption of agricultural technologies by small-scale farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

The legend says that he makes everyone happy. Wrocław’s dwarfs () are small figurines (20-30 cm) that first appeared in the streets of Wrocław, Poland, in 2005. Since then, their numbers have been continually growing, and today they are considered a tourist attraction: those who would like to combine sight-seeing in Wrocław with \\"Hunting for dwarfs\\" are offered special brochures with a map and mobile application software for smartphones. , there are over 350 dwarfs spread all over the city. Six of them are located outside the city at the LG plant in Biskupice Podgórne.  History  A preserved Orange Alternative dwarf graffito In 2001, to commemorate the Orange Alternative (Polish anti- communist movement), a monument of a dwarf (the movement’s symbol) was officially placed on Świdnicka Street, where the group’s happenings used to take place. In 2003, the Mayor of Wrocław, in an attempt to continue the new tradition, unveiled a small plaque on the door of The Dwarves’ Museum. It can be found at the height of human knees on the wall of a historic tenement called Jaś, which is situated between the Market Square and St. Elizabeth’s Church. The figures of the dwarves, which are smaller than the Orange Alternative monument on Świdnicka Street, were placed in different parts of the city. The first five, designed by Tomasz Moczek, a graduate of the Academy of Art and Design in Wrocław, were placed in August 2005. These were the Fencer near the University of Wrocław, the Butcher in Stare Jatki arcade, two Sisyphuses on Świdnicka Street and the Odra-Washer-Dwarf, near Piaskowy Bridge. The name of the last dwarf is related to Pracze Odrzańskie, an estate on the outskirts of the city. Since that time, the number of figures has continued growing. A ceremony unveiling two other dwarves took place on the day of June 18, 2008. They were situated on Świdnicka Street, next to W-skers: a dwarf in a wheel chair. The figures represent two disabled dwarves: the Deaf-mute and the Blind. They are part of the Wrocław Without Barriers campaign, which aims at drawing attention to handicapped people living in Wroclaw. Five days later, at the Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Clinic in Wrocław, another dwarf was erected. It was to be the third female dwarf, Marzenka, whose design was based on the logo of the Mam marzenie charity. The Dwarves' Festival takes place in Wrocław every year in September.

Their family homes were at 262 Madison Avenue, and Greyston, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. When the Dodge children were young, their playmates included members of the Roosevelt family, one of whom was Theodore Roosevelt. Cleveland Dodge and his brother, William Earl Dodge III, attended Williston Seminary at Easthampton, Massachusetts, and in 1875 entered Princeton University, graduating the same year as Woodrow Wilson (1879). After graduation, William joined the family firm of Phelps Dodge while Cleveland entered the lumber business under the direction of his uncle, Arthur Murray Dodge. Cleveland married Grace Wainwright Parish in 1883; Grace was a friend of Theodore Roosevelt's sister and Cleveland had known her since childhood. Their first child, Elizabeth, was born in August 1884; tragically Cleveland’s brother, William, died a month later. Cleveland was now the eldest son in the family and was required to take William’s place at Phelps Dodge. The company had started as a mercantile business in 1834 but diversified into copper mining, smelting and manufacturing. The old mercantile side of the business was closed in 1906 and in 1908 Phelps Dodge became a holding company for its mining activities. The officers of the new corporation were James Douglas, Cleveland Hoadley Dodge, Arthur Curtiss James, George Notman and James McLean. Cleveland was a vice-president from 1909 to 1924 and chairman of the board from 1924 until 1926. One of Cleveland’s two sons, Cleveland Earl Dodge, followed him into the business. His other son, Bayard Dodge, became president of the American University of Beirut (formerly, Syrian Protestant College) in 1923. The Dodge family had long been supporters of the college, and of its founder, Rev. Daniel Bliss. In 1914 Bayard married Mary Bliss, the granddaughter of the founder. Cleveland was also connected with the Robert College in Istanbul, Turkey, where he was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees from 1909 to 1926. In 1915, the American ambassador in Turkey, Henry Morgenthau Sr., called for urgent humanitarian aid for the Armenian people who were being threatened with annihilation. Cleveland Dodge was asked to help and he met with a group of affluent people who pledged funding. Out of that came the formation of the American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief (ACASR). Government facilities were placed at their disposal and the following year a national fund raising campaign was organised by President Wilson. Cleveland was a loyal friend to Woodrow Wilson throughout his life. Cleveland with other influential friends managed to get Wilson elected as the President of Princeton in 1902. Cleveland became a trustee of the University in 1904 and supported Wilson’s radical reforms. However, by 1907 Wilson was meeting serious resistance to his changes and within a few years he accepted the Democratic nomination for the governorship of New Jersey. Wilson next ran for president of the United States in 1912 and was elected. Cleveland was one of the largest financial backers for Wilson's presidential campaign and enlisted contributions from many of his former classmates and sympathetic Princeton trustees. He continued to provide financial support for Wilson throughout his years in office and appears to have asked for only one favor. That was in 1917, when war with Germany seemed inevitable, he asked Wilson to do all in his power to keep the United States from declaring war on Turkey and Bulgaria. Cleveland’s philanthropic interests were widespread and included the YMCA, Princeton, American Red Cross, New York Museum of Natural History, the Public Library, Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Zoo, Botanical Garden and Near East colleges. During the Spanish–American War he was in charge of the American Red Cross distribution center in New York. He established the Cleveland H. Dodge Foundation in 1917 with an initial funding of five million dollars, wanting to give money away that came to him during the war years. As well as those large sums, he gave many smaller gifts to individuals with immediate needs. Towards the end of his life he and his second cousin and fellow director, Arthur Curtiss James, were instrumental in bringing about the transfer of the railroad system owned by Dodge Phelps, the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad. It went to the Southern Pacific Company for $64 million. He died on June 24, 1926 in Riverdale, New York of pneumonia. Yachting Cleveland owned a series of yachts starting with a small boat called Kittiwake and then a 46 footer called Wasp. Next came a seventy footer called Hester followed by Corona, a yacht built in 1893 as Colonia to defend the America's Cup although she failed to be selected. She was a very fast vessel and Cleveland, who was a member of the New York Yacht Club, had some success racing her. The \\"Christian Student\\" Cleveland made a gift to Princeton of a bronze sculpture of his dead brother, W. Earl Dodge, called The Christian Student, which had been commissioned by Cleveland from Daniel Chester French, and showed his brother in sports clothing with books under his arms and academic gown over his shoulder. It became the target of student pranks and these became so bad that the authorities eventually had to remove the sculpture to storage. Family tree Legacy *Cleveland H.

It lies entirely within the counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire, crossing the Yorkshire Dales and the Yorkshire Wolds in the north of England, passing through the historic cities of Lancaster and York and scenic towns and villages including Settle, Pateley Bridge and Ripon. At long, the route is designed for the whole range of cyclists, from families to cycling club riders. Although a challenge with some hard climbs—the highest point being over —the route is steadily increasing in popularity. The route is fully open and signed. The route is named after the Wars of the Roses, a 15th- century war between the English dynastic families Lancaster and York.  History  The route was developed by Sustrans and part of the National Cycle Network (NCN Route 69) in partnership with various Local Authorities, Lancaster City Council, Cyclists Touring Club, Bridlington Renaissance Partnership and Welcome to Yorkshire amongst others. The route was opened in 2010 running from Morecambe on the west coast of Lancashire to the east coast at Bridlington. A second diversion between Pateley Bridge and York that goes via Harrogate and Knaresborough was opened in 2011. Additionally, there is a section that links Kingston upon Hull to the cycle route that joins/leaves near Pocklington rather than going to/from Bridlington.  Art  A number of public artworks have been commissioned for the route. Matt Baker is currently developing a series of linked artworks at various points along the route. This work has not yet been completed.  Route  The route is well signposted with signs carrying the name of the route or marked with the red and white heraldic roses from which the name of the route is derived. The route starts in the resort town of Morecambe, Lancashire loosely following the River Lune and the River Wenning into the Pennines at Settle and entering the Yorkshire Dales National Park. From there it makes its steepest climb (eastwards) across the edge of Rye Loaf Hill before descending to Airton. Thence it heads northeast to Grassington before following the River Wharfe for several miles and then turning towards the high point of the route at Greenhow and descending to Pateley Bridge on the River Nidd. Beyond Pateley Bridge the hills are significantly lower and after Ripon (with a short exception of the Yorkshire Wolds) the route is more or less flat, passing through York before finally reaching Bridlington and the North Sea. The route is made up primarily of: *minor roads – quiet, country roads (90%) *main roads – mainly short sections through urban areas (5%) *cyclepaths/off road – disused railway lines, etc. (5%) The Way Of The Roses is best ridden from west to east to take advantage of the prevailing winds from the West and the more favourable gradients. Tradition dictates that you start the ride by dipping your back wheel in the Irish Sea and only ends when your front wheel gets a dip in the North Sea at the finish. It is typically completed in 3–5 days.  Related NCN Routes  Way of the Roses signs at Winterburn, the junction between routes 68 and 688. The Way of the Roses makes use of 8 National Cycle Network routes. Starting in Morecambe on Route 69. It transfers to Route 68 at Clapham on to Route 688 at Winterburn and Route 65 at Linton-on-Ouse Through central York it follows the short Route 658 before joining Route 66 At Pockington it takes Route 164 over the Yorkshire Wolds before picking up Route 1 near Hutton Cranswick which it then uses to the finish in Bridlington. The route links to other parts of the NCN so can be used as part of a longer cycle tour. In addition to the above listed routes the way of the Roses has junctions with Route 700 at Morecambe Route 6 at Lancaster Route 67 near Fountains Abbey and Route 167 at Huggate in the Yorkshire Wolds Route maps for The Way Of The Roses and detailed route guides from other publishers are available from Sustrans.

The Palestinian militant squad infiltrated the coastal city of Nahariya in Israel by sea from Lebanon. Three civilians and one Israeli soldier were killed during the event. The attack was the first time in which militants infiltrated into Israel from Lebanon by sea. Details of the attack Shortly after 23:00 on 24 June 1974, three Palestinian militants, belonging to the Fatah militant organization, reached the coast of the Israeli city of Nahariya, using an engine run Zodiac inflatable boat. It is believed that their target was the Ga'aton cinema, where they would perform a mass attack at the end of a film screening. The militant squad headed eastward straight into Nahariya. After crossing Balfour Street, they tried to cross a hedge. The noise they made caught the attention of a teenager who lived on the first floor of a nearby apartment building. He looked out of the window, spotted them in the light of streetlights, and shouted out: \\"terrorists!\\". As a result, two patrolling officers of the Nahariya Civil Guard who were nearby rushed to the area. When the militants spotted them they threw a hand grenade and fired at them. The officers returned fire while taking cover. The time was 23:10. The sound of gunfire alerted Israeli security forces in Nahariya. In addition, an Israeli army officer who lived nearby, Major Yitzhak Israel, called the police, then barricaded himself at the entrance to prevent the militants from entering his building. Local police, as well as reserve army officers and soldiers who were in Nahariya soon began arriving at the site. At 23:15, a jeep driven by police superintendent Meir Almagor appeared on the scene, and was immediately shot at by the militants. Almagor then exited the jeep and ran into the nearby municipal court building, where he called the army's Northern Command and established a permanent telephone contact. The militants were forced into the parking lot of an apartment building, and one broke into the building. Israeli security forces, who were arriving in growing numbers, surrounded the area to prevent their escape, and also took up positions on the roof of the municipal court building and on a nearby school. Residents of the apartment building, who understood they were being attacked by militants, locked themselves in their apartments, piled furniture near the doors and took shelter in the inner rooms. One resident of a nearby apartment building, journalist Yehuda Arieli, spotted the two militants in the parking lot and shot at them with his pistol. They returned fire and lobbed a grenade in his direction. Mordechai Zarnekin, who lived on the first floor of the building, feared that the militants would break into his apartment and had his wife Irka, son Gilad, and daughter Ronit escape the apartment from the bedroom window on a rope woven from sheets. After reaching ground, they began running toward the street, but were spotted by the militants, who shot at them and threw a grenade, killing all three of them. Zarnekin, who thought that he had saved his family, tried to escape the apartment as well, but was accidentally shot by Israeli security forces. Wounded, he returned to his apartment, where he hid until found by soldiers. Colonel Shai Tamari of the Oded Brigade initially took command of the security forces on the scene when he arrived; he passed command over to Major-General Rafael Eitan, head of the Northern Command. Eitan arrived together with Captain Mordechai Ben-Shach, commander of the Golani Brigade's Sayeret Golani unit. Soldiers from Battalion 12 of the Golani Brigade, based at Camp Shraga, near Nahariya, were called to the scene; the first Golani unit, commanded by Lieutenant Eldad Ronny, arrived at 23:50. The unit arrived at the eastern perimeter of the building, and was spotted by the militants in the parking lot, who were hiding behind cars. The militants opened fire at them and threw grenades. The soldiers returned fire, and Golani soldiers positioned on the roof of a nearby school also opened fire, possibly wounding the two militants. Shrapnel from a grenade injured one soldier. = Takeover operation = After the contractor that constructed the building provided a detailed explanation of its structure to the army, a plan for a takeover operation was formed. The operation began at 2:10 am, when Israeli soldiers stormed the house. At 2:25 while attempting to open a door, several shots were fired and three grenades were thrown out of the room by a militant. The shots and the shrapnel from the grenades killed an Israeli soldier, First Sergeant Dan Szenes,http://www.namer.org.il/%D7%93%D7%9F-%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%99-%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%A9-%D7%96%D7%9C/ and wounded five. The militant, who was also seriously injured, attempted to crawl out onto the roof, and was identified by the commander of the commando unit in charge of the takeover. The commander charged at him and killed him. Afterwards, soldiers swept through the building, hunting for additional militants. During their search, they broke into Mordechai Zarnekin's apartment, where they found him lying wounded. He was treated on the scene and evacuated. Meanwhile, soldiers searching the parking lot found and killed the two other militants. The operation ended officially at 03:20 am. Three civilians and one Israeli soldier were killed during the event, while seven soldiers and one civilian were injured.  Aftermath  Two weeks after the raid, Israeli gunboats bombarded three Lebanese ports in retaliation, reportedly after Israel received indications that another seaborne attack was planned. The Israeli government claimed the attack was a warning, and that efforts were made to avoid casualties. The Lebanese government reported that one civilian was wounded, and that 21 fishing boats were sunk. Palestinian guerrillas claimed that the Israeli navy also shelled two small fishing villages. Leaflets were dropped in the ports that were attacked, explaining the raid and warning fishermen against helping guerrillas to launch attacks. Following the raid, several rockets were fired into northern Israel from Lebanon, and Israeli troops exchanged fire with gunmen across the Lebanese border throughout the night, with no casualties reported.The Milwaukee Journal - 9 July 1974 issue Israel recognized its vulnerability to seaborne terrorism, and increased security measures. Permanent naval patrols along Israel's Mediterranean coast were set up, along with radar stations and coastal lookouts. Maritime security zones were set up in the northern coastal area, where boating, civilian shipping, and swimming was prohibited. This almost completely stopped maritime terrorism; the last successful attack, which also took place in Nahariya, occurred in 1979.Gaouette, Mark and Carver, Kendall; Cruising for trouble: cruise ships as soft targets for pirates, terrorists, and common criminals The attack also resulted in the establishment of the Civil Guard. Until then, individual Israeli cities and towns had maintained their own civil guards. Following the attack, enrollment in the Nahariya Civil Guard skyrocketed, and within two days of the attack, it had about 900 members.

It extends in a north-westerly direction from Helmsdale towards Kinbrace. History In 1813, during the Highland Clearances, a group of 50-60 men planned an ambush from the settlement of Suisgill in the Strath of Kildonan against a number of men who were employed by the Sutherland Estate in evicting tenants to make way for sheep farming. The estate men who were on horseback were tipped off in advance but were still pursued by the 50-60 men on foot, who as historian James Hunter described, had acted \\"just as their ancestors had done when launching one of the charges characteristic of clan warfare\\". Although the men on horse back escaped, another small group who were employed by the Sutherland Estate to carry out evictions as part of the Highland Clearances were caught in the Strath of Kildonan and surrounded by a mob of about 100 people. These Sutherland Estate employees were mostly shepherds and were permitted to leave as long as they did not return and their leader was told not show his face in the Strath of Kildonan again. In 1869, gold was found in the Strath and was exploited by local crofters and outside prospectors until the enterprise became unprofitable. A following depression in the local economy caused crofters to resume gold digging, which by 1886 brought them into conflict with the Sutherland Estates. Geography The River Helmsdale (also known as River Ullie) flows down the strath and into the sea at Helmsdale. The A897 road runs along the strath, as does the Far North Line, with Kildonan railway station halfway along.Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 scale Landranger mapOrdnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer References Glens of Scotland Landforms of Sutherland Valleys of Highland (council area) 1813 in Scotland ","title":"Strath of Kildonan"},{"id":"31192791","text":"Thomas Bryn (29 March 1782 - 6 September 1827) was a Norwegian jurist, magistrate and civil servant.

The power plant comprised four units. The generation was 22.5 MW on a consumption of about 200 tons of coal per day. The plant was fully operational until 1972 when two units were shut down. In 1984, for practical reasons production mostly ended. However, until 1992 the plant was intermittently used. The structure was demolished in 1995. Location Hussain Sagar Thermal Power Station occupied the banks of Hussain Sagar, Hyderabad - where Prasad's IMAX and NTR gardens exist today.

But shortly before the battle of Dumlupınar, he retired. World War I XIII Corps Ali İhsan Sâbis and his men (Hamedan) In 1918, his army was defeated by the joint British-Indian armies and he surrendered the remains of the 6th Army in October 1918 at the Battle of Sharqat, allowing the British to occupy Mosul which was in violation to the Moudros Armistice signed between the British and Ottoman Empires a few days earlier. Armenian Genocide Ali Ihsan is also known for his role in the Armenian Genocide. While carrying his duties as commander of the 51st division, the Armenians that belonged to those units were murdered outright. When he took command of the 4th army, Ali Ihsan played a crucial role in the forceful exhaustion and starvation of Armenians, which accounted for the lives of tens and thousands.

In 2011 it was included as a contributing property in the Jefferson Square Commercial Historic District. History This was the first statue of Abraham Lincoln built beside, and dedicated to, the Lincoln Highway. with The statue is a replica of W. Granville Hastings' statue in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was a gift of Mr. and Mrs. E.B. Wilson. The bronze statue is life size, and it stands on a two-tiered concrete base. The lower base features a pebblestone finish, and the upper portion is faced with of granite. A bronze plaque with the closing paragraph of Lincoln's second inaugural address is affixed to the upper portion of the base. The Wilsons decided to donate the statue when the present courthouse was completed in 1917. Because they had no children they reasoned they should give something substantial to the community. The Greene County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay half the cost of the base. The Bureau Brothers Foundry of Philadelphia was contracted to create the statue, and they included the plaque at no expense. It was originally planned that the statue would stand atop a base of pink granite from Pipestone, Minnesota. However, because of World War I the War Industries Board, refused to permit the quarrying and carving the stone until the war was over. The Capitol Hill Monument Company of Des Moines erected a temporary concrete base for the statue's dedication on September 22, 1918. The \\"temporary\\" base was replaced in 1964. The Iowa State Highway Commission Service Bulletin and the Lincoln Highway Forum used a photograph of the new statue on the cover of their publications in 1918.

Sylvia Sidney plays a small-town coffee-shop owner who falls for a gangster, ends up in prison and then released in a scheme to trap him. Plot Mary Burns (Sylvia Sidney) runs a small roadside coffee shop near a rural town. She’s desperately in love with 'Babe' Wilson (Alan Baxter ), a young man who has fallen in love with Mary after coming to her coffee shop several times. However, Mary isn't aware that Babe is a gangster wanted for robbery and murder. Babe and his partner in crime arrive at the coffee shop, and Babe tells Mary he has to go to Canada right away on “business”, but he wants them to get married immediately and go away with him. Unfortunately, Mary doesn’t know that Babe’s suitcase is filled with stolen loot. As they prepare to leave, the police arrive to arrest Babe, but he kills his own partner to prevent him from testifying, then he escapes and leaves Mary to be arrested and convicted for aiding and abetting a known criminal. After serving three years of her fifteen-year sentence, Mary escapes with a fellow female inmate, Goldie Gordon (Pert Kelton), unaware that Goldie is actually cooperating with the police. They want to use Mary to lure Babe out of hiding. Mary gets a job as a maid at a hospital, and she meets Barton Powell (Melvyn Douglas ), a famous explorer and writer who is recovering from snow blindness. They fall in love after Mary spends several weeks reading to the blind man and talking with him about his adventures. When one of Babe’s accomplices, Spike (Brian Donlevy), comes to the small apartment that Mary and Goldie share and says he’s taking her to Babe, Mary flees and goes to the hospital to see Barton one last time. She doesn’t tell him she’s leaving forever, she simply slips out quietly after he falls asleep. Mary travels from Oklahoma to Utah and hides out in a small town, but Babe finds her and tries to abduct her during a church service. However, the police have tracked Mary to the small town. Undercover men among the congregation try to arrest Babe, but he shocks the crowd by producing a hand grenade, and he threatens to pull the pin if they don’t let him leave with Mary. Babe and Mary escape, and he instructs her to hide again until can find a way to rejoin her. Mary is terrified of the homicidal killer, and she hopes he won’t find her, but the police succeed in doing so again, and Detective Harper (Wallace Ford), the policeman in charge of the manhunt, takes her to Barton Powell’s rustic lakeside house to reunite the couple. Barton has recovered his sight and sees Mary for the first time with his own eyes. He promptly proposes, and Mary accepts. Detective Harper and his men stake out Barton’s lakeside home and wait for Babe to show up to get Mary. But the wily killer manages to sneak into the house, and he threatens to shoot Barton if Mary doesn’t leave with him. Mary pretends she’s about to kiss Babe, but she reaches inside his coat, takes hold of a second pistol in his shoulder holster, and pulls the trigger several times, killing Babe. Afterwards, Detective Harper sees to it that Mary’s criminal record is expunged, and she marries Barton.

Background Director Vicki Abeles made this movie after the pressures of school, homework, tutoring and extracurricular activities made her middle-school daughter physically sick. Abeles started to make changes at home, but the problem seemed more systemic. She heard similar stories about the unintended consequences upon kids of today’s education system and culture. The difficulty at first seemed to center on one critical issue: the plight of students driven to acquire the strong performance requirements for selection by top universities for enrollment to ensure rewarding careers. Recounting the story of a local high school girl who committed suicide under fear of academic failure, the film indicts some of our most fundamental assumptions about the way we educate children. Synopsis Race to Nowhere is a film containing stories of young people across the country who have been pushed to the brink, educators who are burned out and worried that students aren’t developing the skills they need, and parents who are trying to do what’s best for their children. Reception Since its release in 2010, Race to Nowhere has garnered a wide range of praise and criticism. Former Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch has called it “a compelling film about the stress that kids today experience.” Trip Gabriel of The New York Times called it “a must-see movie.”Trip Gabriel, (December 8, 2010) https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/education/09nowhere.html In a review for Slant Magazine, Jesse Cataldo gave the film a rating of two stars out of four and criticised the film's lack of objectivity and \\"occasional lapses into hysterical worrywarting\\", but called it \\"the rare documentary that provides legitimate answers to the questions it raises\\". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times was critical of the director's attempt to make a \\"single, clear narrative\\" out of such a large topic, but praised her compassion. Writing for The Village Voice, Ella Taylor said that the director \\"sheds little new light\\" on why many parents, teachers and politicians are in favor of extensive homework and testing of high school students. Distribution Though Abeles has been approached by major distributors offering to place her movie in commercial theaters, the filmmaker has chosen to distribute the film directly. Price of the movie depends on license, which ranges from individual home use to group screening in communities, education organizations, professional associations and civic groups. The individual household license has fixed price and includes a DVD disc, cost of other licenses is negotiated for each screening.

Four civilians were killed during the event and more than 20 civilians were injured. The three attackers were killed by responding Israeli special forces. The incident became notorious after an enraged mob of Israeli civilians that the army and police failed to control burned the bodies of the militants. The attack Typical neighborhood in Beit She'an during the late 1970s On Tuesday, November 19, 1974, three Palestinian militants who infiltrated into Israel from Jordan disguised as laborers. The militant squad arrived at the town of Beit She'an in northern Israel and entered a 4-storey building in the Eliyahu neighborhood. The militants were equipped with AK-47 rifles, grenades, bombs, axes, as well as a loudspeaker and leaflets for the negotiations with the Israeli security forces. Initially the militants fired through the apartment doors hitting Mazal Edry, who died later of her wounds in the stairwell. Then the squad broke into the apartment of the Bibas family who lived on the third floor. After murdering the mother of the family, they threw grenades from the windows, demanding the release of their comrades from Israeli prisons. During the event, the three children of the Bibas family, jumped out of the apartment from their third-floor window, suffering only light injuries. Jean Pierre Alimi, a resident of the neighborhood, was killed by the militants while he helped evacuate the wounded. The people evacuated from the building alerted the Border Police who soon afterwards surrounded the building. An attempt was made to negotiate with the militants. The IDF sent a team from the elite Sayeret Matkal special forces unit, which included Muki Betser, Shay Avital, and Nehemiah Tamari. After negotiations failed, the Sayeret Matkal team broke into the building, and killed the three militants in an exchange of fire. During the exchange of fire, the father of the Bibas family was killed. During the entire event some 20 Israeli civilians were injured, many of them children whom jumped out of their apartment windows in order to save their lives. =Fatalities= * Mazal Edry, 42, of Beit She'an * Jean Pierre Alimi, 37, of Beit She'an * Zohar Bibas, 53, of Beit She'an * Yehuda Bibas, 53, of Beit She'an The perpetrators After the attack the Palestinian militant organization Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the attack. Prior to this attack the organization performed several major attacks against Israeli targets, including: the Avivim school bus massacre carried out on May 22, 1970, and the Ma'alot massacre carried out on May 15, 1974. Aftermath After the militants were killed, a large crowd of locals gathered around the building. The police and IDF forces at the site failed to stop them as the angry residents entered the apartment and threw the bodies of the militants out the window. The angry mob poured petrol on the bodies and torched them. The body of one of the victims was accidentally lit as well. The maltreatment of the militants bodies was later on condemned by the Minister Shimon Peres and Rabbi Shlomo Goren who participated in the funerals of the victims.

Education and career Shaffer received an A.B. in History and East Asian Studies (1987) from Harvard University and his M.S. (1996) and Ph.D. (1998) in Media Arts and Sciences from MIT. Shaffer was a student of James J. Kaput, Mitchell Resnick, William J. Mitchell and Seymour Papert, who studied with Jean Piaget. Shaffer began his career as a teacher at The Mountain School, an independent school in Vershire, VT. He taught and worked as a teacher-trainer in the US Peace Corps in Nepal from 1989–1991 in a secondary-level science and math teacher development program sponsored by the Asian Development Bank. After completing his studies at MIT, Shaffer taught in the Technology in Education program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and conducted research in medical education at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. In 2001, Shaffer became an Assistant Professor in Education Psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2006, to Full Professor in 2008, and became the Vilas Distinguished Achievement Professor of Learning Science in 2016. He has also been the Obel Foundation Professor of Learning Analytics at Aalborg University in Copenhagen since 2016, a Principal Investigator at the Wisconsin Center for Education Research since 2001, and a Faculty Affiliate of the Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison since 2005. In 2008, Shaffer founded EFGames, LLC, an educational game development and consulting firm. Shaffer was a Marie Curie Fellow at Utrecht University from 2008–2009, and received a Fellowship to the European Institute for Advanced Study at École normale supérieure de Lyon for 2015. Theories Shaffer is a scholar in the fields of the Learning Sciences, Education, and Educational Psychology best known for his work on computer games and learning. Shaffer's research was originally based on the development of epistemic games, or games that simulate real-world problem solving. Based on studies of how people learn to solve complex problems in realistic settings, Shaffer developed epistemic frame theory, which suggests that professional thinking is best understood not in terms of knowledge and skills in a professional domain, but rather as an epistemic frame composed of knowledge, skills, values, and identity linked by a particular professional epistemology—-a way of making decisions and justifying actions. This theory has been tested in a range of professions, including architecture, journalism, urban planning, and engineering. Building on epistemic frame theory, Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) is a mathematical technique used to quantify the development of epistemic frames. Based on Social Network Analysis, ENA creates network models of the connections a person or group of people makes among the frame elements (skills, knowledge, values, identities, and epistemologies) of a professional practice. ENA is an example of quantitative ethnography, a term coined by Shaffer to describe a set of research methods leveraging novel statistical models and data visualization techniques to augment the scale and power of rich qualitative analyses . Originally developed to identify meaningful differences between groups of learners , quantitative ethnographic approaches have also been used to analyze data from other disciplines, such as history and systems engineering . Epistemic Games Shaffer has been involved in the creation and study of several epistemic games. = Pandora Project = Players become high-powered negotiators, deciding the fate of a real medical controversy: the ethics of transplanting organs from animals into humans. Along the way, they learn about biology, international relations, and mediation. = Escher's World = Players become graphic artists and create an exhibit of mathematical art in the style of M.C. Escher. Based on an architectural design studio, the game helps players learn to think like designers about geometry and graphic art. = Journalism.net = Players become reporters working for an online newsmagazine. Working with professional journalists and interviewing community leaders, these young reporters learn about how journalists think about news and its important relationship to the community. = Digital Zoo = Players become biomechanical engineers. Using Sodaconstructor, a sophisticated physics simulation, they design wire-frame character prototypes for an upcoming animated film. Players meet with clients and engineering experts, and present their work, developing real-world skills while learning concepts in science and engineering. = Urban Science = Players engage in the professional practices of urban planning and learn how to become ecological thinkers in the process. They work together to tackle the urban issues that face their city, using iPlan, a Geographic Information System (GIS) tool that helps them develop a comprehensive plan for their community. = Land Science = Land Science extends the game Urban Science. In Land Science, players become interns at the office of a fictitious urban and regional planning firm, Land Management Associates. Players weigh the trade-offs of land use decisions in ecologically-sensitive areas, interact with virtual stakeholders and use iPlan, a custom-designed Geographic Information System, to develop land use plans for local and national sites. = Nephrotex = Players are welcomed as early career hires into the fictitious company Nephrotex, whose core technology is the ultrafiltration unit, or dialyzer, of a hemodialysis machine. The players' assigned task is to design a next-generation dialyzer that incorporates carbon nanotubes and chemical surfactants into the hollow fibers of the dialyzer unit. Since design is a foundational discipline for engineers, we focus on bringing engineering design to first-year engineering students. Epistemic Network Analysis Epistemic network analysis (ENA) was originally developed as a tool to model connected understanding that characterizes complex learning in communities of practice in terms of epistemic frames. Although originally designed to assess epistemic frames in virtual game environments, ENA is used more generally to quantify the structure of connections that constitute complex thinking as they manifest in discourse, or more generally to quantify and visualize the development of any phenomenon, such as fMRI data on brain activity, that can be characterized by changes in connections over time. = Application of ENA to data on learning = In ENA, logfiles from learning activities are coded for the presence of key elements in a target domain, such as engineering or journalism. For any two elements of the target domain, the strength of their association in an epistemic network is computed based on the frequency of their co-occurrence the logfile data. The model of linkages between elements over time quantifies the development of a network. These models can be projected into a high-dimensional space. Trajectories of change over time in networks can be visualized as paths through this space, and differences between networks (including possible convergence towards some ideal configuration) can be measured by calculating the distance between networks. Because changes in network structure are linked to specific points in time, ENA can associate key changes in complex and collaborative thinking with specific activities that learners undertake. = Other applications of ENA = The ENA toolkit is available online and has been used to model data from a diverse array of domains, including ethnographic data, log files, video game data, classroom teacher discourse, interview transcripts, and neuroscience imaging.

She was the third wife of early modernist Czechoslovak-Austrian architect Adolf Loos. Biography Claire Beck was born in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia in 1904, one of three children of Olga (Feigl) Beck and Otto Beck. Claire became engaged to Adolf Loos (1870–1933) after he invited the Beck family to see a Josephine Baker performance in Vienna in the spring of 1929. They were married in Vienna on 18 July of the same year over her parents' opposition to the much older Adolf. Because it was a mixed marriage (Claire was from a Jewish family, Adolf was not), the Jewish community refused to execute the marriage. They divorced in 1932. Loos's immediate and extended relations—the Beck, Hirsch, Turnowsky, and Kraus families—and her friends the Semmlers were some of Adolf's first clients. They hired him to remodel apartment interiors in Pilsen and Vienna, and it was there that Adolf first began to open up the \\"interstitial spaces\\" between walls to create continuous rooms. In 1936, Loos published Adolf Loos Privat, a literary work of \\"razor-sharp anecdotes\\" about her ex-husband's character, habits, and sayings that was illustrated with family photographs. Published by the Johannes-Presse in Vienna, the book was intended to raise funds for Adolf Loos's tomb, as he had died destitute three years earlier. Loos and her mother moved to Prague at the beginning of World War II and were later deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp, Claire in 1941 and Olga in 1942. They were separately transported from there to Riga, Latvia, where they were presumably shot or gassed on arrival in 1942. Legacy In 2012-13, some of Loos's photographs were included in the exhibition Vienna’s Shooting Girls: Jewish Women Photographers in Vienna. In 2011, Adolf Loos Privat was published in its first English translation under the title Adolf Loos: A Private Portrait.

One person was killed during the takeover. An IDF special unit freed the hostages and killed the four militants the same day. During the operation, an IDF soldier was killed, and his wife, one of the hostages, was fatally wounded. Details of the attack Moshav Kfar Yuval. Photo taken in 2011 On June 13, 1975 a squad of militants belonging to the Arab Liberation Front militant organization crossed the border from Lebanon, heading towards the Israeli village of Kfar Yuval. The squad, which was hiding in the apple plantations of the village, was not detected by the security forces, although security had been reinforced in the village after the breach in the border fence was discovered. On the night of June 15 four militants infiltrated a house in the village. One of the family members, Nehemiah Joseph, who was an Armored Corps soldier, attempted to stop them, blocking the entry to the house doors by gathering furniture next to the door, but was killed by the militants immediately; the other people in the house were taken hostage. After Israeli military forces arrived at the scene negotiations with the militants began, with the help of the local resident Rahamim Cohen, who volunteered for the job as he spoke fluent Arabic. The militants presented a proclamation with demands to release prisoners detained in Israeli prisons, including Archbishop Hilarion Capucci and Japanese militant Kōzō Okamoto. =Takeover operation= Yaakov Mordecai, the husband of hostage Simcha Mordecai and a combat soldier in the Golani Brigade in his army service, heard about the hostage-taking while on his way to work and quickly returned to the village, not knowing that his wife and 11-month-old son were among the hostages. He spoke with the commander of the northern command and demanded to be allowed to join the takeover force, mainly because he knew how the rooms in the house were laid out. The commander of the northern command accepted and Yaakov joined the takeover operation team. As the force began breaking into the house they were shot at by the militants. Yaakov went ahead of the rest of the takeover team and charged into the house and shot two militants dead, but was himself killed by a grenade that also fatally injured his wife Simcha. The rest of the takeover force, encouraged by Mordechai's daring move, broke into the house and in the resulting exchange of fire, killed the rest of the squad. Yaakov Mordecai was killed and Yitzhak Yosef-Chai, the father of the family taken hostage, and his son Avraham Yosef-Chai were seriously injured during the exchange of fire. Yaakov's wife Simcha was also injured, and died the next day in the hospital. Their infant son Assaf was saved because his mother hid him in a washing machine. Both Assaf and his brother Bezalel were wounded.https://www.jta.org/1975/06/18/archive/israelis-seek-to-adopt-child- whose-parents-terrorists-killed Yaakov Mordecai was posthumously awarded the Medal of Courage.

The selection process may prove controversial, as the officially atheist Chinese government has expressed unusual interest in choosing the next Dalai Lama and claims it has the right to do so, something contested by Tibetan Buddhist religious authorities.  Background  Following the Buddhist belief in the principle of reincarnation, the Dalai Lama is believed by Buddhists to be able to choose the body into which he is reincarnated. That person, when found, will then become the next Dalai Lama. According to Buddhist scholars it is the responsibility of the High Lamas of the Gelgupa tradition and the Tibetan government to seek out and find the next Dalai Lama following the death of the incumbent. The process can take a long time. It took four years to find the 14th (current) Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso. The search is generally limited to Tibet, although the current Dalai Lama has said that there is a chance that he will not be reborn, and that if he is, it would not be in a country under Chinese rule. To help them in their search, the High Lamas may have visions or dreams, and try to find signs. For example, if the previous Dalai Lama was cremated, they can watch the direction of the smoke to suggest where the rebirth will take place. When these signs have been interpreted and a successor found, there is a series of tests believed to ensure that they are the genuine reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama. They assess the candidate against a set of criteria, and will present the child with various objects to see if they can identify those which belonged to the previous Dalai Lama. If a single candidate has been identified, the High Lamas will report their findings to eminent individuals and then to the Government. If more than one candidate is identified, the true successor is found by officials and monks drawing lots in a public ceremony. Once identified, the successful candidate and his family are taken to Lhasa (or Dharamsala) where the child will study the Buddhist scriptures in order to prepare for spiritual leadership.Dalai Lama: a spiritual leader who is found, not chosen, The Guardian, 27 August 2008 According to Tibetan Buddhism the Tulkus do not have to take rebirth in a continuous sequence of lives in this world.  Statements by 14th Dalai Lama  14th Dalai Lama in 2012 In a 2004 interview with Time, the current Dalai Lama stated: The Dalai Lama stated in 2007 that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman, remarking, \\"If a woman reveals herself as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form\\". On 24 September 2011, the Dalai Lama issued a statement concerning his reincarnation giving exact signs on how the next one should be chosen, the place of rebirth and that the Chinese appointed Dalai Lama should not be trusted.Statement of His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, on the Issue of His Reincarnation Website of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet September 24, 2011. Accessed December 26, 2014. Archived December 30, 2014. In October 2019, the 14th Dalai Lama stated that because of the feudal origin of the Dalai Lama reincarnation system, the reincarnation system should end. https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/dalai-lama-feudal/  Statements by Chinese government  In 2015, the Tibet regional governor Padma Choling (白玛赤林) said: Regarding this issue, in an article from Vice Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman said: The apparent contradiction that an atheist government is involved in the afterlife and re-incarnation did not go unnoticed. As described by Jonathan Kaiman for the Los Angeles Times: \\"In China, it's not easy to become a \\"living Buddha\\". First come the years of meditation and discipline. Then comes the bureaucracy. (...) Although the ruling Communist Party is an officially atheist organization – officials are barred from practicing religion – it is perennially uncomfortable with forces outside of its control, and has for years demanded the power to regulate the supernatural affairs of Tibetan Buddhist figures, determining who can and cannot be reincarnated.\\" On August 3, 2007, State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 was issued by China which states that all the reincarnations of tulkus of Tibetan Buddhism must get government approval, otherwise they are \\"illegal or invalid\\". Rule 8 says approval for request is required if lot- drawing process using Golden Urn is exempted.《藏传佛教活佛转世管理办法》第八条 历史上经金瓶掣签认定的活佛，其转世灵童认定实行金瓶掣签。请求免予金瓶掣签的，由省、自治区人民政府宗教事务部门报国家宗教事务局批准，有特别重大影响的，报国务院批准。  Further analysis  Several analysts have stated that even if China picks a future Dalai Lama, it will lack the legitimacy and popular support needed to be functional, as Tibetan Buddhists all over the world would not recognize it. According to Tibetan scholar Robert Barnett \\"This is one of the chief indicators that China has failed in Tibet. It's failed to find consistent leadership in Tibet by any Tibetan lama who is really respected by Tibetan people, and who at the same time endorses Communist Party rule.\\" Lobsang Sangay, Sikyong (prime minister) of the Tibetan government-in-exile, said: \\"It's like Fidel Castro saying, 'I will select the next Pope and all the Catholics should follow'\\".

It aimed to achieve this by asking voters to sign a pledge that they would use their vote to help secure a majority of Members of Parliament (MPs) in support of an in-out referendum on EU membership. The 1975 European Communities membership referendum was the last time such a vote had occurred in Britain. The campaign did not take a view on whether the UK should stay in, or leave, the EU; simply that the expansion of the EU's powers and influence over government since the 1975 'common market' referendum merited people being consulted again on continued membership. According to the Labour Party MP Kelvin Hopkins: \\"While those who initiated the People's Pledge campaign are primarily Eurosceptic, it has support from those who take a different, pro-EU view, but who wish to see the issue properly resolved by a vote of the British people.\\" Directed at its launch by Mark Seddon, with cross-party support from MPs including the Labour party's head of policy Jon Cruddas MP and other politicians including then Mayor of London Boris Johnson,Boris Johnson signs the People's Pledge City AM 26 March 2012 it aimed in particular to focus pressure on MPs in marginal seats using the tactic of holding independently scrutinised constituency referendums.

Prominent Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan wrote in his 2016 book What Next? that \\"The People's Pledge was the most effective popular campaign I have ever been involved with, and must be reckoned one of the most successful pressure groups in British history.\\" James Forsyth, writing in The Spectator, said that the campaign's recruitment of Boris Johnson as a supporter had made an EU referendum almost certain: \\"Boris Johnson's decision while campaigning last month to sign up to the campaign for an in/out referendum on EU membership could be a key moment in the history of the Conservative party – the moment when the party's balance of power tipped decisively in favour of a referendum.\\" Along with Forsyth, Paul Goodman of ConservativeHome and Leo McKinstry of the Daily Express have cited the success of the campaign as a main reason why a referendum became a possibility.Could George Osborne's leadership ambitions deliver a referendum, ConservativeHome, 11 May 2012.David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg: We demand our EU referendum, The Daily Express, 14 May 2012. Background In January 1973, on its third application, Britain was accepted into the European Economic Community. The 1975 European Communities membership referendum was held after that, following a change in government from the Conservatives under Edward Heath who had led the application process, to the minority Labour government of Harold Wilson, who had made a referendum an election promise. The referendum found 67% to be in favour, on a 65% turnout. Subsequent treaties leading to the development of the European Union were signed into law without recourse to a referendum. According to the campaign, all three major British political parties withdrew promises of a referendum on the last major European treaty, which proposed the creation of a European Constitution, after it was re-drafted as the Treaty of Lisbon, and subsequently ratified by the UK on 19 June 2008 by the Labour Government of Gordon Brown. The subsequent 2010 general election unusually produced a hung parliament, leading to a Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition government bound by an agreement that there would be \\"no further transfer of sovereignty or powers over the course of the next Parliament\\", and to cover for future terms, proposed the introduction of the European Union Bill 2010, which sought to \\"amend the 1972 European Communities Act so that any proposed future treaty that transferred areas of power, or competences, would be subject to a referendum on that treaty\\". The coalition did not however commit to holding a referendum on the status of the existing membership. A YouGov poll conducted in September 2010 of 1,948 adults in the UK found that if there was a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, 47% would vote to leave, compared to 33% who would want to remain. Launch The People's Pledge campaign was launched in Westminster on 15 March 2011. The campaign website had been launched two days earlier. The campaign described its views citing five key reasons why a referendum was needed: that nobody under the age of 54 had ever been given the chance to vote on the issue (i.e., those aged 18 or over in 1975), that the EU now made the majority of laws of the United Kingdom, that the ministers and parliamentarians making those laws were not accountable to British voters, that the cost of the EU to the British taxpayer was rising, and that the European Commission was aiming for further powers of economic governance. The campaign claimed that over 6,000 people had already signed the pledge before the official launch, and 30,000 people had signed by 17 March. Dan Hannan in The Daily Telegraph claimed: \\"in the first 5 days more than 42,000 people had signed up via the campaign's website and 3,000 more volunteered to help leaflet\\".Join the campaign for an In/Out referendum, The Telegraph, 21 March 2011. The People's Pledge were at launch the only campaign listed in the BBC's \\"Timeline: Campaigns for a European Union referendum\\".Timeline: Campaigns for a European Union referendum, The BBC, 25 October 2011. The launch was accompanied by front-page coverage in support of the campaign by the British tabloid newspaper the Daily Express, headlined 'New Hope to Get Out of EU'. The Daily Express had themselves shortly beforehand delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street calling for an EU referendum, under the Express 'Crusade' banner 'Get Britain Out of the EU'. Commenting in the article, Mark Seddon stated that what differentiated the People's Pledge campaign was that the initiative had come from the left. In response, the then leader of the Labour party Ed Miliband told the paper: \\"It seems to me that we made a decision on Europe in 1975. I think it was the right decision.\\" Seddon further set out the campaign's objectives in an article for The Daily Telegraph titled \\"A referendum on Europe is long overdue\\". Writing for the political magazine The Spectator, Peter Hoskin stated that, while there had been many previous campaigns for such a referendum, the timing of the People's Pledge campaign was slightly more resonant. Hoskin cited the recent positions of the two parties that went on to form the governing coalition in 2010 and polling suggesting 54% of people would prefer to have a referendum on the issue of the EU, instead of the 2011 referendum on the Alternative Vote brought about as part of the coalition agreement and scheduled for 5 May 2011. This would be the first national referendum since the 1975 EU membership referendum. On the campaign's potential, he stated, \\"at the very least, it might persuade some candidates to face up to, and meet, the tide of public opinion on Europe\\", claiming that public support for leaving the EU had been steadily rising and even a large number of non-Eurosceptics have wanted such a referendum for some time. Caroline Crampton writing for Total Politics magazine said \\"the campaign has pulled off a major coup by persuading touchy-feely Tory Zac Goldsmith to lend his support. Goldsmith, a star of the new intake, gives the campaign a way of rebutting the idea that this is a thinly veiled attempt to put pressure on the government to pull out of the EU. He lends credibility to their claim that this is just about democratic consultation\\".With Zac on the case, resistance is futile, Total Politics, 15 March 2011. Also writing in The Spectator, Charles Moore said \\"the real power of this campaign will be seen in the selection of candidates. If constituencies can muster a few thousand Pledgers, anyone wishing to be an MP next time round will be wise to favour a referendum whether he or she wants in or out\\".The Spectator's Notes , The Spectator 19 March 2011. In his weekly column, Trevor Kavanagh of The Sun called the People's Pledge \\"the first serious, credible and accelerating campaign for a proper referendum since 1975\\",Why Osborne has to cut us free from the EU , The Sun, 21 March 2011. going on to say it was backed not only by traditional Eurosceptics but also by \\"major firms alarmed by soaring costs and dubious benefits\\".

On 9 May 2011 the campaign was featured on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week program hosted by Andrew Marr.

It was announced in the Morning Star that the Communist Party Executive backed the People's Pledge.Communist Party Executive Committee: EU carrying out coups in Athens and Rome, The Morning Star, 13 November 2011. Campaign strategy The People's Pledge was a cross-party political campaign to bring about a binding yes or no referendum in the United Kingdom on the issue of Britain's continued membership of the European Union. It aimed to achieve this by making sure that only prospective candidates or sitting MPs standing for election to the House of Commons in the next United Kingdom general election who promise to support the holding of such a referendum, are elected. Specifically, it asked voters to sign up to a pledge via the campaign's website to only support such candidates. In addition to showing the total number of signatories, the campaign would also present those figures broken down by constituency. The campaign claimed this breakdown would be particularly effective in swaying the outcome in the 100 most marginal seats. In addition, the campaign sought to make available to all who signed the pledge, the voting record of their local MP on European issues. Co-founder Christopher Bruni-Lowe outlined the strategy of the campaign in the November edition of Total Politics magazine in an article titled \\"Putting voters back in charge\\". The pledge that voters are urged to sign is worded as follows: Early activities =AV referendum= The People's Pledge announced its first ground campaign in Sheffield Hallam on 4 and 5 May 2011, which was publicized by the Evening Standard.Now Vicky is on Clegg's Case , \\"Evening Standard\\", 3 May 2011.

The museum lies about south of the village of Valle, just about up the hill to the east of the Norwegian National Road 9, just east of the river Otra. The museum was opened in 1977, and it consists of a courtyard and several surrounding farm buildings on a piece of farmland. History Nordigard Tveiten was once the home of the district sheriff Olav Knutsson Tveiten. He was a representative at the Norwegian Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll in 1814 and he served as the local sheriff from 1785 until his death in 1837. The Tveitetunet farm became part of Setesdal Museum () in 1969 and it was opened to the public in 1977. During the eight years prior to its opening, it underwent some restoration work. The farm was chosen because of its good condition and that it was representative of the old farms that once covered the Setesdal region of Norway. The Setesdal Museum was established in 1935 to preserve the historic artifacts, buildings, and traditions of the Setesdal region. The museum is responsible for approximately 70 historic buildings throughout the Setesdalen valley, including the Rygnestadtunet museum several kilometers to the north. In 1974, the museum purchased an old barn with a stable and cowshed from a neighboring farm in Valle which were moved and erected on the site of Tveitetunet and then again in 1987 the museum purchased a mill house for the farm and restored it.

The Foundation's mission is \\"To achieve a better understanding of the effects of alcohol on the health and behavior of individuals; To provide the scientific basis for the prevention, treatment and future cure of alcohol-use disorders; To fund innovative, high quality research; To support promising new investigators; To share information with the research community and other interested parties.\\" Studies on the effects of alcohol consumption - innovative ideas, looking at alcohol in the context of many complex factors - are approved annually by independent advisory committees, with grants being awarded to institutions in the United States, Canada and South Africa. Currently, the Foundation funds approximately $1.2 million in research grants and conference support annually. Over 260 institutions and more than 570 grantees in the United States, Canada and South Africa have been awarded grants since ABMRF's founding in 1982. The Foundation encourages open communication of research through peer-reviewed scientific journals and research conferences without any foundation review or approval, assuring quality and independence in science. To date, ABMRF grantees have amassed more than 2,350 articles, book chapters or scientific presentations based upon Foundation-funded research. History ABMRF was founded in 1982 as the Alcoholic Beverage Medical Research Foundation (ABMRF). Prior to its founding, ABMRF's predecessor organization was the Medical Advisory Group (MAG). Formed in 1969 under the administrative auspices of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the MAG was created to provide independent medical information on the health effects of alcoholic beverages and prevention of alcohol abuse to members of the brewing industry. The MAG was an esteemed council of physicians from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Harvard University, Yale University and Dartmouth College. The MAG merged with a similar group in Canada, the Health Advisory Group. At this point, the Foundation became independent of Johns Hopkins and the Alcoholic Beverage Medical Research Foundation was formed, ensuring ironclad scientific independence from its financial contributors. Evaluating and recommending applications for research grants became the primary focus. Emphasis was placed on prevention rather than treatment, concentrating on short- and long-term effects of moderate drinking, why a minority of drinkers move beyond moderate to excessive intake, and prevention of alcohol misuse. These effects could be not only medical but also social and behavioral, so two advisory committees were born: the Medical and Biomedical Advisory Council and the Behavioral and Social Advisory Council. Following the highest scientific and academic traditions, all grant applications were peer-reviewed by a team of highly respected individuals serving on these councils. Leadership Currently, the Foundation is led by Dr. Mack C. Mitchell, Jr., who was selected to serve as president in 1989 and also serves as vice chairman of internal medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. The Board of Trustees is chaired by Bruce M. Ambler, M.B.A., retired president and chief executive officer of Constellation Holdings. The Medical and Biomedical Advisory Council (MBAC) reviews applications in the biological, physiological and clinical sciences. The chair of the Medical and Biomedical Advisory Council is Dr. Laura E. Nagy, professor of molecular medicine at Cleveland Clinic and former ABMRF grantee. The Behavioral and Social Advisory Council (BSAC) reviews applications in the behavioral and social sciences. The BSAC is led by Dr. Kim Fromme, professor of psychology and director of Studies on Alcohol, Health and Risky Activities Lab at University of Texas at Austin and former ABMRF grantee. A team of highly respected leaders in the alcohol research community serve along with the chairs of the advisory councils to select the best and brightest investigators from academic and scientific institutions for an ABMRF grant award. Prior to Dr. Mitchell's tenure, Dr. Thomas B. Turner, ABMRF's founder, served as president from 1982 - 1989. The first chairman of the Behavioral and Social Advisory Council was Dr. Alex Richman, chairman and professor of psychiatry and preventive medicine at Dalhousie University, and Dr. Brian MacMahon, professor and head of the department of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, chaired the Medical and Biomedical Advisory Council. Grants Program ABMRF/The Foundation for Alcohol Research supports scientific studies on the use and prevention of alcohol abuse. Promising young investigators at institutions in the United States, Canada and South Africa are eligible for funding. Young investigators should be independent, faculty members, who are either new to the field or a trained researcher beginning a new line of research. Nearly 75% of the grant awards go to researchers in instructor or assistant professor positions. The Foundation accepts applications for grants to conduct research on important aspects of alcohol consumption and its effects. Of greatest importance to the Foundation are the transitions in drinking patterns and behavior; health effects of moderate alcohol use; behavioral and biomedical effects of alcohol, and biobehavioral studies on the etiology of alcohol misuse. Grant awards are a maximum of $75,000 for each of two years, for a total of $150,000 for the two- year project. Applications are electronic and may be found on the Foundation's website.

He is noted for his involvement in the formation of The Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) and the planning of Operation Overlord. Family and education Rowcroft was the son of Colonel George Francis Rowcroft. He was educated at Haileybury and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Military career After his initial involvement with the TA, Rowcroft received his commission in 1911 after he passed out of Sandhurst into the Army Service Corps. At the outbreak of The First World War he served with the BEF overseas serving with various mechanical transport units. By 1918, Rowcroft worked at the War Office in a technical capacity. During the interwar period he served in India, Ceylon and even at the Tank Inspection Department, at Woolwich Arsenal. His Army Career continued along the Technical route when in 1936 he was appointed Commander Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), 1st Div in Palestine. =Second World War= On the outbreak of the Second World War, Rowcroft was in command of the RASC Training Battalion, back in the UK. However the repair and recovery element within the British Army was divided between the various service corps of the time, this was considered inefficient. By 1942 REME was formed to recover and maintain the army's equipment, both in the battlefield and in the rear area, with Rowcroft becoming its first Director.

He is a dual winner of the Champion Hurdle and previously held the world record for most Grade 1 (or Group 1) races won by any racehorse until overtaken by Winx in 2019. Originally bred to be a flat racer, the gelding began his racing career in France where he had moderate success, winning twice in ten races. At the end of 2007 he was sold and transferred to Ireland where he began to compete in National Hunt events. On 15 March 2011, Hurricane Fly ridden by Ruby Walsh won the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham. After finishing third in the 2012 renewal, he became the first horse in thirty-eight years to regain the Champion Hurdle title by winning the race for a second time in 2013. On 26 April 2013 he had his 16th Grade 1 victory in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle equalling the record for Grade 1 wins previously shared by Kauto Star and John Henry. He took sole possession of the record when winning the Morgiana Hurdle on 17 November 2013. He added a further five wins at the highest level before being retired with a record total of 22 such wins in August 2015. That total was equalled by Winx when she won the WS Cox Plate on 27 October 2018. Background Hurricane Fly is a small bay horse with a white star bred in Ireland by the Italian Agricola Del Parco. He is one of many top-class horses sired by Montjeu. Others include the Derby winners Pour Moi, Authorized, Camelot and Motivator, the St Leger winners Scorpion and Masked Marvel and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Hurricane Run. Hurricane Fly was originally sent into training with Jean-Louis Pelletan in France. Racing career =2006 & 2007 seasons: Flat racing= As a two-year-old in France in 2006, Hurricane Fly ran four times, failing to win but finishing second twice. In the following year he won two races including the listed Prix Omnium II (beating the subsequent Champion Stakes winner Literato) but finished well beaten when moved up to Group class in races such as the Prix Daphnis, Prix de Guiche and Prix Eugène Adam. In late 2007 the horse was sold to George Creighton and was transferred to the stable of Willie Mullins at Muine Bheag, County Carlow in Ireland to be trained for a National Hunt career. =2008/2009 season: Novice hurdles= In his first season as a jumper, Hurricane Fly competed in Novice Hurdle races, restricted to horses who had not won a hurdle race before the start of the season. He won a race at Punchestown Racecourse in May and then returned to France to win the GradeThree Gras Savoye Prix de Longchamp Hurdle at Auteuil. Racing over the same course and distance in June he finished second to Grivette in the Grade One Prix Alain de Breil, finishing just ahead of his stable companion Quevega. Returning to Ireland later in the year he recorded his first Grade One win when beating Donnas Palm by a neck in the Royal Bond Novice Hurdle at Fairyhouse Racecourse in November and followed up by winning the Future Champions Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown Racecourse a month later, beating Go Native by ten lengths. In the following spring he bypassed the Cheltenham Festival in March, but ran at Punchestown Festival in April, where he won the Evening Herald Champion Novice Hurdle by seven lengths. =2009/2010 season: Senior hurdles= On his first appearance as a senior hurdler, Hurricane Fly started the 8/13 favourite for the Punchestown Hurdle, but finished third of the four runners behind Solwhit. On his only other appearance of the season returned to Punchestown in April and defeated Solwhit by a neck in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle: the other beaten horses included Thousand Stars, Dunguib, Voler la Vedette and Punjabi. =2010/2011 season= Hurricane Fly was undefeated in five starts in the 2010/2011 National Hunt season. In December he defeated Solwhit in two Group One races: the Hatton's Grace Hurdle at Fairyhouse and the December Festival Hurdle at Leopardstown. In January he won the Irish Champion Hurdle and was then sent to the Cheltenham Festival for the first time to contest the Champion Hurdle. Racing for the first time in England, he started the 11/4 favourite in a field of eleven runners and was ridden by Ruby Walsh. He took the lead at the last flight of hurdles and won by one and a quarter lengths from Peddlers Cross. After the race Walsh described the winner as a \\"deserved champion\\" and \\"a great horse\\". Hurricane Fly ended his season by beating Thousand Stars by five lengths in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle on 6 May. =2011/2012 season= After a break of more than eight months, Hurricane Fly returned to the racecourse in January 2012 to contest the Irish Champion Hurdle. He started favourite at odds of 4/5 and won by six and a half lengths from Oscar's Well. In March he returned to Cheltenham to defend the Champion Hurdle and was made 4/6 favourite in a field of ten runners. He was held up in the early stages and made steady progress in the last half mile, but was unable to reach the leaders and finished third behind Rock On Ruby and Overturn. On his only other start of the season he won the Punchestown Champion Hurdle for the third time, beatind Zaidpour by two and a half lengths. =2012/2013 season= Having failed to convince in the latter part of the 2011/2012 season the 'Fly's' doubters were aplenty. Hurricane Fly began the 2012/2013 season in brilliant fashion by winning the Morgiana Hurdle in November by twelve lengths from Captain Cee Bee. On 29 December the gelding won his thirteenth Grade One race when he won the December Festival Hurdle by seven lengths. Hurricane Fly won his third consecutive Irish Champion Hurdle on 27 January, beating Thousand Stars by five lengths with Binocular in third place. After the race Mullins expressed the view that the gelding had returned to his best form. In the lead up to Cheltenham it was clear that many pundits and bookies still doubted whether the 2011 champion could act on the track. Paddy Power gave a money back special that if Hurricane Fly won, all losing bets would be refunded. A huge crowd travelled over from Ireland in expectation of what was about to unfold and to support their hero, Hurricane Fly. On 12 March 2013 at Cheltenham, Hurricane Fly attempted to become the first horse since Comedy of Errors in 1975 to regain the Cheltenham Champion Hurdle. Ridden by Ruby Walsh, he was backed from 9/4 in the morning into an SP of 13/8 favourite against eight opponents, including 2012 champion Rock On Ruby and 2010 champion Binocular. After going through a flat spot and appearing to struggle early in the race, Hurricane Fly tracked the front-running Rock On Ruby before coming back on the bridle coming around the home bend and taking the lead after the second last hurdle. Once he hit the front it was obvious he would not be passed. He won by an impressive two and a half lengths from the 2012 champion, Rock On Ruby with Countrywide Flame in third place. Hurricane Fly returned to the winners enclosure to a rapturous reception from the crowd and cemented his place in history following this performance.Racing Post On 26 April Hurricane Fly ended his season by winning his 16th grade one race, equalling legendary chaser Kauto Star and American flat champion John Henry. This was also Hurricane Fly's fourth consecutive Punchestown Champion Hurdle, he comfortably beat Thousand Stars by seven lengths with Rock On Ruby back in third. =2013/2014 season= Hurricane Fly began his next season in the Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown on 17 November. Starting the 1/16 favourite he created a new world record by recording his 17th Grade I success, but was not particularly impressive in beating Marito by one and a quarter lengths. Both Mullins and Walsh stated that the gelding would improve significantly for the race. On 29 December, in the Ryanair Hurdle at Leopardstown, Hurricane Fly took on two of the best young hurdlers in Ireland: Our Conor the winner of the 2013 Triumph Hurdle and Jezki, the winner of the 2013 Hatton's Grace Hurdle. Hurricane Fly took the lead approaching the final hurdle and won by two and a half lengths from Jezki, with Our Conor three and a quarter lengths back in third place. He headed a list of 18 entries for the 2014 incarnation of the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham, announced on 16 January 2014. On 26 January Hurricane Fly attempted to win the Irish Champion Hurdle for fourth time. Starting the 4/7 favourite, he took the lead approaching the last hurdle and fought back after being headed to win by one and a half lengths from Our Conor with Captain Cee Bee third and Jezki the last of four. Hurricane Fly started 11/4 favourite to win his third Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham on 11 March. He briefly disputed the lead after the second last, but eventually finished fourth behind Jezki, My Tent Or Yours and The New One. Hurricane Fly finished his season by finishing second to his Champion Hurdle conqueror Jezki in the Punchestown Champion hurdle in May, going down by 3 1/4 lengths. =2014/2015 season= Hurricane Fly made his 2014/15 seasonal reappearance, as usual, in the Grade 1 Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown on 16 November. Once again Hurricane Fly faced soft going and the reigning Champion Hurdler, Jezki. Ruby Walsh was on board once more in a race that despite attracting a field of 5, was very much a match race between Hurricane Fly and Jezki. With most punters expecting Jessica Harrington's horse to uphold the form from the spring, Jezki was the well backed 8/13 favourite to defeat Hurricane Fly for the third time in succession. Third-choice Little King Robin set the pace and was well clear of the pack early on with Jezki in second and Hurricane Fly in third. The order stayed this way until after the second last when Jezki, ridden for the first time by Mark Walsh, took up the running with Hurricane Fly his shadow. Jezki made a slight mistake jumping the final hurdle and Hurricane Fly, who was travelling much better than the favourite, pounced upon the leader and under a powerful ride from Walsh sprinted past the younger horse to win by 2 1/4 lengths. Hurricane Fly again faced Jezki in the Ryanair Hurdle at Leopardstown on 29 December, with the Triumph Hurdle winner Tiger Roll also in opposition. After racing fifth of the seven runners in the early stages he moved up to challenge for the lead approaching the last and took the lead on the run-in to beat Jezki by half a length. On 25 January, the gelding was again opposed by Jezki as he attempted to win his fifth Irish Champion Hurdle and his twenty- second Grade I race. Starting the 11/10 favourite he took a narrow lead approaching the last and drew away in the closing stages to win by three and a half lengths from Arctic Fire, with Jezki in third. On 10 March 2015, Hurricane Fly attempted to win his third Champion Hurdle in five years and started the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Faugheen, The New One and Jezki. He was in touch with the leaders for most of the race and made a forward move approaching the final hurdle but was outpaced on the run-in and finished third behind Faugheen and Arctic Fire, beaten six and a half lengths by the winner. The gelding was then stepped up in distance for the World Series Hurdle at Punchestown in which he was beaten into second by Jezki. In June he returned to France for the first time in seven years to contest the Grande Course de Haies d'Auteuil over 5100 metres and was made favourite against fourteen opponents on very soft ground. He stayed on in the closing stages without ever looking likely to win and finished sixth behind Un Temps Pour Tout. His retirement from racing was announced on 31 August 2015 with Mullins calling him \\"the horse of a generation\\".

Early life Born in the town of Ramanathapuram (also known as Ramnad) in Tamil Nadu, Murugabhoopathy obtained his early lessons in Mridanga from his father Chitsabai Servai (also Sirchabai Servai) and later on from Palani Muttiah Pillai (the father of Palani Subramania Pillai), both of whom were students of the great Pudukottai Manpoondia Pillai (read as Maamudia Pillai). Murugabhoopathy’s elder brother C. S. Sankarasivam Bhagavatar was a strong influence in the development of Murugabhoopathy's musical style. A young CSM picked up many tips from legendary percussionists including Kumbhakonam Azhaganambi Pillai, who taught him some intricate techniques of playing with his left hand. Major performances Murugabhoopathy accompanied many carnatic stalwarts such as Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Chittoor Subramania Pillai, Musiri Subramania Iyer, and Dandapani Desikar. CSM benefited a lot from the generous promotion and support given by Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer.An interview of Ramathapuram C S Murugabhoopathy published in the music magazine Shruti, July 1985 (issue 17 S, page 6)A radio interview of Ramanathapuram C S Murugabhoopathy conducted by Mr Subramanya Deshikar (AIR Madras) He later on played alongside G.

Basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy consumed per unit of time when all environmental factors are considered neutral, the digestive system is in a post-absorptive state (meaning that the digestive system is inactive, which requires about twelve hours of fasting in humans), and the energy expenditure is only sufficient to support normal functioning of the vital organs, the heart, lungs, nervous system, kidneys, liver, intestine, sex organs, muscles, and skin. Formulas for estimating basal metabolic rate take into account age, weight, height, activity level, body fat mass, and lean body mass. All the components in the body require various levels of energy to be maintained. Body fat requires much less energy than lean muscle, as lean muscle is much more metabolically active and therefore requires more energy expenditure to remain in homeostasis. If comparing two individuals, with all variables being equal, the person with more lean muscle mass will have a higher basal metabolic rate, and therefore, a lower metabolic age in comparison to those with the identical chronological age.

The change from the Act of 1986 to the Act of 1988 concerns the mandatory minimum penalties to drug trafficking conspiracies and attempts that previously were applicable only to substantive completed drug trafficking offenses. The Act amended 21 U.S.C. 844 to make crack cocaine the only drug with a mandatory minimum penalty for a first offense of simple possession. The Act made possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base punishable by at least five years in prison. The five year minimum penalty also applies to possession of more than three grams of cocaine base if the defendant has a prior conviction for crack cocaine possession, and to possession of more than one gram of crack if the defendant has two or more prior crack possession convictions. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 also offers several other amendments to the Act of 1986. First, the organization and coordination of Federal drug control efforts. Next, the reduction of drug demand through increased treatment and prevention efforts. Also, the reduction of illicit drug trafficking and production abroad. Lastly, sanctions designed to place added pressure on the drug user. The ADAA projected budget for these amendments was $6.5 billion for the 1989 fiscal year”. The result of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 was not foreseen. “After spending billions of dollars on law enforcement, doubling the number of arrests and incarcerations, and building prisons at a record pace, the system has failed to decrease the level of drug-related crime. Placing people in jail at increasing rates has had little long-term effect on the levels of crime”. It also re-established the federal death penalty. The H.R. 5210 legislation was passed by the 100th U.S. Congressional session and enacted into law by the 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan on November 18, 1988.

In the film, he is voiced by John Travolta. His journey and the personal evolution that it provokes in him is core to the film's main themes. In the film, he has spent his entire life from early puppyhood on the set of a television show, kept isolated from the outside world. In the show, Bolt must use his superpowers to save his owner and co-star Penny, whom he loves dearly, from the evil Dr. Calico. However, Bolt believes that he actually has the superpowers possessed by his television character, a delusion the directors of the show maintain by tricking Bolt into thinking his adventures are real, in order to make his performance more authentic. The character Bolt was created by Chris Williams and Byron Howard together with the chief character designer Joe Moshier. Much of the inspiration for the character was provided by John Lasseter who also oversaw Bolt's visual development. Aside from the film, Bolt also appears in the direct-to-video short film Super Rhino, the two video games Bolt and Disney Infinity, the Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom trade card role-playing game. In addition, photos of Bolt appear in Wreck-It Ralph (2012) and Big Hero 6 (2014). The character received mostly positive critical acclaim from film critics and became a breakout character, leading to strong sales of merchandise and toys following the film's release. Development =Characterization and design= Early concept art of Bolt The character known as Bolt initially started out as a red, bipedal dog named Henry as designed by Chris Sanders. He, in difference to Bolt, would be aware of the fact that he is an actor. Henry, as well as Sander's idea for the movie, was eventually scrapped when John Lasseter and some colleagues from Pixar reviewed the project. The character was subsequently redesigned and made into a White German Shepherd, although changes were done to the muzzle, ears and overall body-structure to give the character a more distinctive and expressive appearance. To make Bolt's movement seem more realistic and in-line with that of real canines, the animation department studied the body language and locomotion of real white shepherds and utilized virtual bone-structure in the CGI-models.Toon Tuesday: Recycling, Disney Feature Animation-style, Jimhillmedia.com. Personality-wise, the new Bolt would be more naïve and insecure conveying more pathos than Henry. At the same time, the art department worked to give Bolt a whimsical nature with a pose which excels confidence, thus allowing the character to have a contrasty personality and a body language which reflects that. =Voice work= John Travolta was chosen to do the voice work for Bolt. Despite a history of turning down voice over offers for animated characters, he agreed to provide the voice for Bolt as he, according to the actor himself, \\"indicated as the right character\\". In an interview with CBS, Travolta explained that he was intrigued with Bolt's personality after reading the script. \\"When I read this script and saw this character, so guileless, so kind of naive and fun and touching I just said to myself; maybe this is the one to do\\".Travolta Gets Animated, BCS: The Early Show When recording the dialog for Bolt the animators would film Travolta's facial expressions and use them when sketching the storyboard and animating Bolt's mimics. Travolta took inspiration from his performance from earlier action films such as Broken Arrow and Face/Off, mixing it up with a certain naiveté and guilelessness suitable for Bolt's character.Official Disney Production Notes, Disney.go.com. =Physical appearance= Bolt's breed is not specified in the movie but the animators based him on the White German Shepherd Dog, his big, erect ears and long, brushy tail being the most prominent indicators. Most of the time, his ears are standing vigilantly erect over his head which matches his intent personality and sharp profile, and allowed the animators to emphasize his expressiveness as they leave his face uncovered. Bolt is a medium-sized dog with a height at the wither of 50 cm and a creamy white coat. Bolt has a strong neck with thick, double-coated fur, which is raised when excited and lowered while running, much like a real shepherd dog. The difference between Bolt's back head and neck is not very defined. Bolt's appearance is \\"softer\\" than a normal German Shepherd with a more curved outline, thick, rounded legs and domed forehead. The \\"normal\\" Shepherd has longer, thinner legs and a more meager appearance. Bolt's coat is a creamy white and his fur differs in thickness as it is short haired over his belly, flanks and back, and a bit thicker over his neck. The animators worked much with Bolt's fur so that it would seem soft and fluffy with every hair moving in a realistic way. Special animation software was used by the production team to animate and render Bolt's more than 200,000 hairs.Oscar nominees share behind-the-scenes stories at AMPAS' Best Animated Feature Symposium, Jim Hill Media. During the making of the movie, having Bolt's white fur getting smudged and dirty was a bit of a challenge according to the animators. =Breed= There has been some disagreement in the Disney fan community as to whether Bolt is indeed a White Shepherd (as suggested by early promotional material where he was erroneously referred to as a German Shepherd) or a Berger Blanc Suisse. Supporting this theory is the fact that the Blanc Suisse variate tend to be smaller with a more square-cut muzzle which aligns more with Bolt's in-movie appearance. Bolt's breed is never mentioned in the film. Joe Moshier, Bolt's main character designer, has indicated that Bolt is loosely based on a white German Shepherd puppy the animation team studied during the character's early design phase, but was never intended to be any one specific breed. Background From early puppyhood, Bolt has been playing the lead in a popular TV-show where he is a genetically altered superdog with superpowers such as the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes and the iconic “superbark”. His mission is to protect his owner Penny, a child actress, and save her father from the evil villain Dr. Calico. Although the dog's love and concern for Penny is authentic, everything else about his life is, unbeknownst to Bolt, entirely fake. The programme makers are intentionally setting up the show with extensive scenography and real-time special effects in a way to condition the young canine into believing the fiction around him is real and that his owner is in immediate danger. This is shown when Penny and Bolt are chased by Calico's forces in a fictional city, which is presented as reality to fool viewers. For the experiment to work, Bolt is not allowed to get a glimpse of reality and is therefore locked in a trailer inside the studio where he is allowed to spend a few minutes together with Penny after each shooting. When, responding to demands from the higher-ups, the director ends an episode with a “cliff- hanger” in an attempt to boost ratings which involves Calico capturing Penny, Bolt escapes from his trailer convinced that Penny is in mortal danger. In the process of trying to find and save her, he knocks himself unconscious and ends up in a shipping box packed with Styrofoam, and, unknown to the film company and a saddened Penny, is subsequently shipped to New York City. Stranded in the real world, Bolt initially and unsuccessfully attempts to recreate the stunts from the TV-show, most of the time ending up hurting himself in the process. As he eventually comes to realize that his sense of reality, and therefore his sense of identity, has been severely screwed, he still holds on the hope that Penny's love for him was real and not faked. With the help of Mittens, an abandoned street cat, and Rhino, a fearless, TV-obsessed hamster and Bolt fan, who help him recognize his limitations and come to terms with his self-realization, he embarks on a journey back to Hollywood where he is eventually rejoined with Penny after saving her from a burning sound-stage. =Personality= Bolt and Penny are allowed a few minutes together after each shooting. Bolt is depicted in the film as having a very complex and multifaceted personality. When in the company of Mittens and Rhino, in the beginning of the movie, he is earnest, intent and introverted. The gradual process of self-realization did at times make him hostile towards Mittens who attempted to convince Bolt that he is delusional. However, after his epiphany, Bolt opened up to Mittens and trusted her to help him adjust to reality and teach him how to be a normal dog. When in the company of Penny, his owner, Bolt behaves much like a normal affectionate, albeit very protective dog. Despite the handicap provided by his delusions, Bolt is portrayed as a highly intelligent character who is quick to adapt to new environment and find solutions to problems. When he can't break into a U-haul truck with his heat vision, Bolt instead distracts nearby workers with a coin and sneaks in. When Bolt rescues Penny from the burning building, he is able to locate a ventilation shaft and bark to alert firemen outside, before succumbing to smoke inhalation. During his entire journey, Bolt remained loyal to Penny, fixed on the goal of returning to her. After his brush with reality, Bolt also begins to open up to other characters in the film. His ability to trust other characters, despite the hardship he has been through is depicted as one of his most admirable characteristics. Reception and cultural impact The character Bolt was met with generally positive critical reception with critics praising the animators' work with his body language, as well as Bolt's personality and expressiveness.

Bolt was also included as the \\"recommended pet dog\\" in FilmCritic.com list of \\"The best Fantasy Creatures”.Recommended Fantasy Movie Pets , Filmcritic.com . Another example of the characters cultural impact was the \\"Superbark Contest\\" which took place in Finsbury Park, England, shortly after the movie's release. Inspired by the titular character's iconic superbark, dozens of owners rounded up their dogs to try to break the record for loudest bark in history. More than 50 dogs participated and a represent from Guinness World Records was on hand to oversee the contest. A white American shepherd dog, who was handpicked due to his striking resemblance to Bolt, broke the record with a 108 decibels and became a Guinness World Record holder. Disney's Gavin Quirk was quoted saying: \\"The Big Bolt Bark has brought pride to the nation.\\" Bolt Gets Britain's Dog To Bark The Loudest, MovieChair.com. Since 2009, the Bolt character has been spotted semi-regularly at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.

The wildfire had been caused by an unattended campfire that spread rapidly in the hot and dry weather in the Pacific Northwest. Four firefighters were killed when the fire cut off their only escape route out of the narrow canyon. The fire burned of forest land dominated by Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine trees in the Chewuch River canyon. More than a thousand firefighters were involved in suppressing the fire, which was declared contained on July 23, 2001. Suppression costs ran US$4.5million. A Forest Service investigation found that numerous safety procedures were violated leading up to the fatal entrapment: fire managers repeatedly underestimated the potential danger of the situation and failed to establish and maintain escape routes and safety zones. Incident commander Ellreese Daniels was later charged with involuntary manslaughter and making false statements to investigators. Daniels pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of making false statements to investigators as part of a plea deal; he was sentenced to three months of work release. Environmental conditions The fire began in the Chewuch River canyon about north of Winthrop, Washington. The canyon—located in the Okanogan National Forest—runs from northeast to southwest, with steep slopes of approximately . The canyon floor near the point of origin is about wide. Fuels in the canyon included spruce, Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine and cottonwood trees at the canyon floor and Doug-fir, lodgepole, and ponderosa pine on the canyon slopes. A single dead-end road follows the canyon upriver and leads to the Thirtymile Campground. High temperatures, low humidity, and extended drought conditions combined to create the potential for extreme fire behavior. The winter of 2000–2001 was the area's second-driest winter in 30 years, and on July 10, 2001 temperatures in the canyon reached and relative humidity dropped to about 8%—both near-historic extremes for the area. On July 9, the Libby South Fire was accidentally ignited by the exhaust system of a fire patrol vehicle about south of Winthrop. The fire grew to over by that evening, making it the first major North Cascades wildfire of the season. Firefighting response =Initial attack= The Thirtymile Fire was first reported at 9:26pm Pacific Daylight Time on July 9, 2001 by a Canadian firefighting aircraft returning to Canada after working on the Libby South Fire. A small firefighting crew was dispatched, arriving at the fire shortly after 11pm that evening. They soon discovered the fire's origin—an escaped picnic cooking fire. Those responsible for abandoning the campfire that started the fire were never found. The initial crew encountered spot fires burning on both sides of the Chewuch River and estimated the fire's size at . At around midnight, the incident commander requested additional firefighters and resources, stating that the fire must \\"be taken care of tonight because if it hits that slope it is going to the ridge top.\\" Although the fire was located in a remote area far from any towns or homes, Forest Service officials did not consider allowing the fire to burn. Officials believed that due to the severe fire conditions, the Thirtymile Fire could quickly grow out of control and spread to popular recreation areas and private land. The Entiat Interagency Hotshot Crew (IHC) arrived at the scene about an hour later, at 1am on July 10. Hotshot crews are among the most highly trained wildland firefighters in the United States. They are sent to large or high-priority fires, often for extended periods of time and with little logistical support. The Entiat IHC had spent July 9 suppressing a fire near Spokane, Washington, and was dispatched to the Thirtymile Fire with almost no rest. Shortly after arrival, the Entiat IHC supervisor assumed the role of incident commander of the fire. At 2am, the Entiat IHC requested air support and an additional crew for later in the morning. The hotshot crew continued to work on digging fire lines and containing spot fires until they were relieved by the Northwest Regulars #6 crew at 9am. =Northwest Regulars #6= Fire crews observe the fire from the \\"lunch site\\" safety zone The Northwest Regulars #6 (NWR#6) were a Type 2 fire crew consisting of 21 members from two Ranger Districts in central Washington. Many of the crew members were young and inexperienced—over one-third were rookies in their first fire season with the Forest Service. Shortly after midnight on July 10, the NWR#6 crew was called up to assist in fighting the Libby South Fire. The crew was divided into three squads and headed by crew boss Ellreese Daniels and crew boss trainee Pete Kampen. Daniels was a twenty-year veteran of the Forest Service who had previously served as a division supervisor during the 1988 Yellowstone fires. Kampen—as crew boss trainee—was put in charge of overall tactics, while Daniels acted as a supervisor. This delegation of responsibilities led to confusion among the crew and dispatch as to who was in charge of the situation. After arriving in Twisp, Washington at 7am, the crew was informed they would instead be sent to the Thirtymile Fire. The NWR#6 crew arrived at the fire scene at around 9am and began reviewing the situation with the Entiat IHC. The role of incident commander was transitioned again, this time to NWR#6 crew boss Ellreese Daniels. At 11am, the Entiat IHC left the scene to rest at a campground two miles down the canyon. The NWR#6 crew then began setting up pumps and digging fire lines. By noon, the crew began experiencing various equipment failures. The firefighters had problems operating water pumps, several fire hoses burst, and pulaskis were broken. As the fire behavior intensified, a NWR#6 crew member was sent to call back the Entiat IHC. The hotshot crew arrived back at the fire scene at around 2pm. At 3pm, the NWR#6 crew and the Entiat IHC assembled at a safety zone known as the \\"lunch site\\", where they rested, ate lunch, and prepared their return to the fire. =Entrapment= The road and rock scree where the fire shelters were deployed At around 3:30pm, two wildland fire engines arrived at the scene. The fire engine crews proceeded up the road from the lunch site and began working on spot fires, trying to contain the fire to the east side of the road. One engine radioed the NWR#6 crew requesting assistance with a spot fire north of the lunch site. Squads 1 and 2, along with incident commander Ellreese Daniels set out to support the fire engine. Shortly after arriving, the engine drove south to work on other spot fires. The third squad was then called to assist an engine—which was now about down the road from the other two squads. Minutes after arriving, the fire began spotting near the road and Squad 3 retreated to the lunch site. Squads 1 and 2 attempted to escape, but were cut off by fire crossing the road. With the only escape route blocked, Ellreese Daniels drove the 13 members of Squads 1 and 2 up the canyon looking for a safe place to wait out the fire. Daniels selected a site about up the road near a bend in the river. The location had relatively sparse vegetation and was flanked by a large rock scree to the west and the Chewuch River to the east. Shortly after 5pm, two civilians who had been camping further up the road encountered the firefighters while attempting to leave the area. The two had driven up the road to the Thirtymile campground at 1pm and did not notice any firefighters along the way. Although the district fire management officer had ordered the road closed earlier that day, no action was taken until after 3pm. At 5:24pm, the fire's behavior abruptly changed, overwhelming the crew. Daniels instructed everyone to deploy their fire shelters—last-resort safety devices designed to protect wildland firefighters from heat and deadly gases. Six firefighters deployed on the rock scree, while the others and the two civilians stayed on the road. Although the shelters are designed to be used by one person, the two civilians shared a shelter with crew member Rebecca Welch. Minutes after deployment, two of the firefighters on the rock scree abandoned their fire shelters: Thom Taylor ran and jumped in the river, while Jason Emhoff sought safety in the crew's van. =Rescue and body recovery= Approximately 30 minutes after the deployment, Pete Kampen and members of the Entiat IHC arrived for the rescue operation. The eight firefighters and two civilians who deployed on the road suffered only minor burns and smoke inhalation. Jason Emhoff experienced third degree burns to his hands as a result of attempting to put out flames in his shelter without wearing gloves. The four firefighters who remained on the rocks exhibited no signs of life. All four—Tom Craven, of Ellensburg, and Devin Weaver, Jessica Johnson, and Karen FitzPatrick, all of Yakima—had died as a result of asphyxia due to inhalation of superheated products of combustion. Craven, who served as a squad boss during the fire, was a veteran firefighter in his thirteenth fire season with the Forest Service. Weaver, Johnson and FitzPatrick were all in their first season. The incident was the deadliest wildland firefighting disaster in the US since the 1994 South Canyon Fire in Colorado, which killed 14 firefighters. The Thirtymile Fire went on to burn an area of before it was declared fully contained on July 23. Over 1,000 firefighters were brought in to fight the fire. Suppression of the Thirtymile Fire cost a total of US$4.5million. Aftermath =Investigation= Thirtymile Fire Memorial wall located at the deployment site The Forest Service promptly opened an investigation into the incident. The investigation team first met in Twisp, Washington on July 11 and began conducting interviews, examining the fatality scene and analyzing the fire. On September 26, the team released their findings in a report which found that \\"leadership, management, and command and control were all ineffective due to a variety of factors\\". According to the report, numerous safety rules were broken, the fire's potential growth was disregarded, and leadership failed to communicate effectively and enforce orders. Each of the Ten Standard Firefighting Orders were violated at some point during the incident. The standard orders are a set of wildland firefighting rules which cover basic safety such as staying informed of fire weather conditions, identifying safety zones and escape routes, issuing clear instructions, and maintaining control of the fire crew. Additionally, the investigation found two major failures in leadership which led to the fatalities: the decision to re-engage the fire and the lack of preparation for a burnover at the entrapment site. Crew boss trainee Pete Kampen had already considered the fire \\"lost\\" when the crew pulled back to the lunch site. The Forest Service report states that \\"there was no viable strategy established\\" for the crew's return to the fire. The report also found that after the entrapment, incident commander Ellreese Daniels took no actions to improve the deployment site or prepare the crew. Following the release of the report, the Forest Service sought disciplinary action against 11 employees, ranging from termination to letters of reprimand. The agency recommended firing Ellreese Daniels and permanently removing Pete Kampen from fire work. After an appeals process, the Forest Service reduced most of the disciplinary actions. No employees were fired. Daniels was removed from fire work and accepted a new position as a materials handler. =Criminal charges= In December 2006, federal prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against Ellreese Daniels in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. Daniels was charged with four counts of manslaughter and seven counts of making false statements to investigators. Prosecutors alleged that Daniels was grossly negligent while supervising the fire, and that he lied to Forest Service and Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigators about ordering firefighters to come down off the rock scree. If convicted, Daniels faced up to six years in prison for each manslaughter charge. As part of a plea agreement, Daniels pleaded guilty in April 2008 to two misdemeanor charges of lying to an investigator in exchange for dropping the other charges. In August 2008, he was sentenced to three months of work release and three years of probation. =Memorials= In 2002, the Forest Service constructed a memorial to the four deceased firefighters at the fatality site. The stone Thirtymile Fire Memorial wall was unveiled on the first anniversary of the deaths. A second memorial to the firefighters was built by the parents of Tom Craven at their son's gravesite in Roslyn, Washington. The Roslyn memorial is open to the public and includes a rock and charred trees from the spot where the firefighters died, as well as various statues, plaques and pictures.

In addition to developing and testing its Somatostatin vaccine technology in a variety of species and for different metabolic conditions, the company has also expanded its worldwide intellectual property positions by multiple filings and anticipates several additional filings to support their technology.http://www.wirednewsengine.com/2010/06/01/Braasch-Biotech-Granted- Novel-Patent-for-Somatostatin-Vaccines-in-High-Value-Therapeutic- Markets_201006015829.html Technology Somatostatin (also known as Growth Hormone Inhibiting Hormone) is the main regulator for the release of Growth Hormone (GH) from the pituitary gland, which leads to several body functions including an increase of IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1) levels. Somatostatin inhibits the actions of Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone, also a hypothalamus hormone, which controls the release of Growth Hormone. Braasch's Somatostatin vaccine technology allows the immune system to temporarily reduce, but not completely eliminate, the mostly inhibitory actions of Somatostatin. The vaccination effect causes more Growth Hormone to be released, which in turn stimulates the release of IGF-1 from the liver. This hormone cascade can help address issues relating to obesity and Type 2 diabetes, since growth hormone deficiencies can lead to increased risk for those conditions.http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/162473.php Research and development For human applications, Braasch Biotech is focused on human obesity and Type 2 diabetes applications, along with Growth Hormone deficiencies and IGF-1 disorders. In the veterinary field, Braasch has developed vaccines to increase livestock productivity and reduce obesity in pets (dogs, cats, and horses). The applicability of GH and IGF-1 treatments are currently being pursued by many pharmaceutical companies for a variety of human conditions. Based on the success of drug treatments, over time, Braasch will pursue additional applications and intellectual property for their vaccination approach (e.g. development of myocardial infarction treatments).

He was inspired by the ideologies of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal and joined the freedom movement at a very young age. He is the person who named the region as Rayalaseema when everybody taunted the region as Ceded because Nizam ceded the region to the British. Early life and education Rao was born in Kurnool in 1883. After finishing school education in Kurnool, Nandyal and Gutti, Rao finished his M.A. from Madras Christian College in 1906. While at the Teachers Training College of Rajahmundry, he joined the Indian Independence movement. = Rajahmundry college incident = Rao and his fellow students attended a lecture by Bipin Chandra Pal at Rajahmundry. Inspired by Pal's speech, the students wore badges inscribed with 'Vande Mataram' to the college the next day. Mark Hunter, the college principal, objected and refused to admit the students until they removed the badges. The students refused. The principal dismissed Rao, who was the student leader, from the college. Hari Sarvothama Rao being debarred from employment as a teacher in any government or aided school or college. Later he was debarred from employment in any government office. This was a critical moment in Rao's life. The Rajahmundry college incident marked the beginning of Andhra student participation in the freedom struggle of the country. American Rocket Scientist and the inventor of Optimum Rocket Nozzle (Bell nozzle) called Rao's Nozzle or Rao Nozzle), Dr. Gadicherla V.R. Rao (G.V.R.Rao) is related to Gadicherla Harisarvottama Rao. Role in the Freedom Movement In 1908, Rao started a Telugu weekly newspaper publication called 'Swarajya' with the help of Bodi Narayana Rao. He wrote numerous essays in this newspaper criticizing the many unfair policies adopted by the British government. The British declared that his article 'Viparita Buddhi', which adopted a very severe tone in criticizing violence against the Indians (Sarvotham particularly wrote to the effect \\"The cruel English tiger has devoured two Indians!\\"), was an act of sedition and sentenced Rao to three years in prison.Emperor v. Bodi Narayana Rao and G. Harisarvothama Rao, (1909) ILR 32 Mad 338-\\"Lord Campbell’s Act, of course, is not in force in India, and the Criminal Law of England is not necessarily the same as the Criminal Law of India as contained in the Indian Penal Code …\\" the case is inter alia referred to vicarious liability In 1914, Gadicharla was made the secretary for the Andhra division of the Home Rule League formed by Tilak and Annie Besant. In this position, he played a pivotal role in inspiring the people by traveling widely to lecture. In 1923, he joined the Swarajya Party formed by Chittaranjan Das and Motilal Nehru. He was elected to the Madras Legislative Council as a candidate for the Andhra Congress from the Nandyala constituency.  Fifth Session of the Andhra Mahasabha  The Fifth Session of the Andhra Mahasabha was held at Nellore on 1 June 1917 with Konda Venkatappaiah as president. The session proved to be stormy and brought to light the differences between Circars and Rayalaseema. From the beginning of the Andhra movement the people of Nellore and Rayalaseema were lukewarm in their support for a separate province. The people of Nellore because of their proximity to Madras city did not like to severe their connections with the metropolis which they felt would remain outside the territorial limits of Andhra. In Rayalaseema the leadership was in the hands of Tamils domiciled in the area like Kesava Pillai of Gooty (Anantapur district) and Ekambara Aiyer of Nandyal (Kurnool District). They did not like the creation of separate Andhra province as it would affect the domination of the of Tamils in Telugu districts. The Telugu leaders of Rayalaseema like Harisarvothama Rao of Kurnool supported the creation of separate Andhra province. In the Fifth Conference the opponents of separate Andhra were determined to defeat the resolution on the Andhra province. Of the 740 delegates more than 480 belonged to Nellore district. Fearing that the resolution would be defeated by the sheer numbers of one district Harisarvothama Rao proposed that voting should be district-wise, one vote being given to each district. The proposition was carried out as by the time of voting a large number of fresh delegates from the Circars joined the conference. The opponents of a separate province felt frustrated and met separately at the town hail and passed a resolution that a separate province would be desirable only if Madras city was included in it. B.N. Sarma and other leaders succeeded in removing the misunderstanding of the dissidents and they participated in the next day's session. The resolution requesting the Government to create a separate Andhra province was passed even though some prominent Nellor leaders like A.S, Krishna Rao voted against it. The amendment of the dissidents for the inclusion of Madras city in the Andhra province as its capital was rejected. But the Circar leaders realised that the support of Rayalaseema for a separate Andhra province could not be taken for granted, and that there was an urgent need to remove the fears and misunderstandings of the people of that area.

Taxonomy Heteroteuthis dispar is a deep sea species of squid and relatively little is known about it because of the difficulty of observing it in situ. Its description is very similar to that of Heteroteuthis hawaiiensis, which is found in the central North Pacific Ocean. It has not been possible to compare the two species side by side and so it is unclear whether they are identical. DNA sequencing should eventually clarify this issue.Tree of Life Web Project Distribution Heteroteuthis dispar is found in the Mediterranean Sea and across the Atlantic Ocean. The range includes a broad swathe from southwest Ireland south to the coastal fringes of West Africa, across to Bermuda, the Caribbean Sea and the eastern fringes of the United States north to Maryland. The western and eastern Atlantic populations may be isolated.FAO Species report Description There are five pairs of appendages. Arms 1 and 2 are fused at the base and each is a hectocotylus in the male. Arm 3 has two or three greatly enlarged suckers at the proximal end and a few moderate sized ones at the distal end. Arms 3 and 4 are longer than the others. In the female, arms 1 and 2 have no suckers on the distal ends. The tentacles are retractable, slender and whip-like, with a short club with eight rows of microscopically small suckers.Marine species The funnel is found under the head and the locking apparatus has a deep, curved groove and an angled posterior pit. The mantle margin is detached from the head, and the neck cartilage is either free or fused. On the underside, the mantle shield is confined to the anterior part of the mantle. The fins are quite short and are attached to the posterior part of the mantle from which they bulge forwards.Young, Richard E., Clyde F. E. Roper, and Katharina M. Mangold (1922-2003). 2008. Heteroteuthis Gray, 1849. Version 4 April 2008. http://tolweb.org/Heteroteuthis/20030/2008.04.04 in The Tree of Life Web Project. The mantle length in the adult female is about 25 millimetres. Biology The male Heteroteuthis dispar produces a spermatophore or sperm package which is transferred to the female before she is sexually mature. She stores it and makes use of it at the optimal time for fertilisation. The spermatophore is large, constituting about 3% of her weight, and therefore disadvantageous to her. This reproductive practice may be due to the fact that finding a mate deep in the ocean at the appropriate time is difficult. This species is found in the mesopelagic zone of the ocean at depths down to 1600 metres. Spawning takes place on the bottom and the paralarvae live at even greater depths, down to 3000 metres. Adults often live in groups at depths of 200 to 300 metres, often in areas where shrimps are found. Predators that feed on this squid include dolphins (Grampus griseus), the velvet belly lantern shark (Etmopterus spinax), the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus), the small-spotted catshark, (Scyliorhinus canicula), the swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and tuna (Thunnus alalunga). Heteroteuthis dispar can be bioluminescent, emitting light from photophores containing bacterial symbionts. A large photophore is found on the underside and contains two pores through which the luminescent material is extruded. An iridescent shutter cover helps to filter and control the light.Heteroteuthis dispar The squid can also secrete bioluminescent mucous from glands near the ink sac. This can be released into the water through the funnel and the glowing cloud is believed to blind or confuse predators for long enough for the squid to make its escape.Young, R.E. 1977.

Said to have been of royal or noble blood, Aurea was exiled from Rome to Ostia because she was a Christian. In Ostia, she lived on an estate outside of the city walls and maintained contact with local Christians, including the bishop of Ostia, Cyriacus (Quiriacus). Miracles associated with Aurea while she was in Ostia relate how a Christian prisoner named Censorinus had his chains miraculously loosened after he had been comforted by Aurea.

Another legend states that Aurea and her friends also brought back to life the dead son of a shoemaker. Ulpius Romulus executed Aurea’s friends and tortured Aurea. When she refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods, she was thrown into the sea with a stone tied around her neck. Veneration According to tradition, Aurea was buried on her estate in Ostia.

Early life Hillman was born on 13 November 1848 in Stratford, Essex (other sources say 30 December 1847 in Lewisham, Kent), where his father, also called William, was a shoemaker; his mother was Sarah Stitchbury. He became an apprentice in the engineering works of John Penn & Co. at Greenwich together with his friend James Starley, who became known as \\"the father of the cycle industry\\". Hillman and Starley moved to the expanding industrial area of the English Midlands, where they were employed by the Coventry Sewing Machine Company. Sales of sewing machines had declined, and to compensate the company had become the first British manufacturers of bicycles, using designs based on French \\"boneshakers\\". The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 halted bicycle manufacture in France and led to a boom in British production. Hillman set up his own bicycle manufacturing company in 1875, Auto Machinery, in partnership with W. H. Herbert, who provided the capital.

This canal was proposed in 1943, and again ten years later, by J F Pownall . Pownall observed that there was a natural 'contour' down the spine of England, around the 300 ft level that connected several of the most populated areas. He put forward the idea that this contour could be used to define the course of a large European sized canal which contained no locks except at its entry and exit points. It would also serve as a water grid capable of distributing domestic water supply around England as need arises. The proposal would have accommodated 300-ton continental-size barges.Boris revives Pownall's Grand Contour Canal waterwaysworld.com . 2012, Accessed Sept 2013 Feeder conduit canals at the same contour level would have been used to bring water into the system from North Wales, The Pennines and the South West Peninsula. It was also named The Three-hundred-foot Canal for its height above sea level, . It was to be wide by deep, with headroom. It was intended to connect the major industrial centres of London, Bristol, Southampton, Coventry, Birmingham, Nottingham, Derby, Chester, Manchester, Blackburn, Bradford, Hartlepool and Newcastle, with vertical lift locks at the nine termini, having tanks by by draught. A long tunnel was proposed between Airedale and Ribblesdale. The scheme was intended both for transport and for a water supply grid, for water distribution is a major problem in London and South East England. In 2012 the scheme was brought back to attention after Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, showed his support for the scheme as a way to transport water from the higher, and wetter, areas of Wales, Scotland, and northern England to the 'breadbasket' of the south east. A maximum flow of water of some anywhere in either direction was visualised, sourced from the Northern Pennines , the Dee, the Severn and the Wye and Exmoor . Earlier schemes The Elan Valley Reservoirs scheme (1892) in mid-Wales (capacity 99,000 megalitres) which includes (with four others) the Craig Goch Dam provides water to Birmingham (pop. 1 million), but was designed looking forward 63 years.William Bradford et al, 2010, \\"A review of the 1892 water demand forecast for Birmingham\\", Institution of Civil Engineers, LondonJournal of Engineering History and Heritage, 163, 39-49'The Future Water Supply of Birmingham' by Thomas Barclay, published in 1898 Lake Vyrnwy was created by the construction of the first large masonry dam in Britain, between 1881 and 1888, to provide an urgently needed new water supply for the growing city of Liverpool, and the water from the Welsh mountains was to be carried by an aqueduct to the city. The Longdendale Reservoir, in the Pennines east of Manchester, was one of the first of its kind in the country when it was opened in 1851. By 1875 it was obvious that growing population of the city would need even more water, so plans were drawn up to construct a reservoir in the Lake District. Thirlmere (1894) now provides water for Manchester away.

Description  Bauroolithus eggs are elongated, with a width measuring about half that of its height. The ends of the egg are blunt. At 0.15 to 0.25 millimeters in thickness, the shell is thin and somewhat wavy. The eggshell is divided into wedge-shaped shell units, which are pieces of calcareous aggregate. The surface of the shell is covered in small tear-shaped pores.  Paleobiology  Bauroolithus eggs belong to the crocodyloid basic egg type. Overall, their morphology is similar to that of the eggs of living crocodylians. The eggs of living crocodylians undergo degradation over their incubation period so that hatchlings can easily break through the shells. Some fossils of Bauroolithus in Brazil are most likely from eggs that already hatched, but none show any signs of extensive degradation. This suggests that hatchlings broke through egg shells that were so thin that degradation was not necessary.

Thomas Craule ( c.1337–1417) was a leading statesman, judge and cleric in early fifteenth-century Ireland, who held the offices of Chancellor of Oxford University, Archbishop of Dublin and Lord Chancellor of Ireland.  Early career  He was born in England about 1337; little seems to be known about his family. He entered the Carmelite order. He is recorded as a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1366. He became Warden of New College in 1389 and Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1390. He was a Doctor of Divinity and a judge.  Irish career In 1397, on the death of Richard Northalis, he was made Archbishop of Dublin and arrived in Ireland the following year. After the accession of King Henry IV, Cranley undertook a diplomatic mission to Rome, and was made Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1401. When Henry's son Thomas, Duke of Clarence, was made Lord Deputy of Ireland, Cranley was appointed to his council. A letter which he sent to the King around the end of 1402 painted a grim picture of the state of English rule in Ireland. Cranley assured the King of his absolute loyalty to both the King and his son, but implored the King to send over money and men since \\"your son is so destitute of money that he has not a penny in the world ... and his soldiers have departed from him, and the people of his household are on the point of leaving.\\" The King, who was generally short of money, is not known to have responded to this plea. The pressure of official business, combined with the effects of ill health and old age made Cranley increasingly unfit to perform his duties, and in his later years the office of Chancellor was usually carried out by his deputies, first Thomas de Everdon, then Laurence Merbury. Cranley resigned as Chancellor in 1410, but in 1413 the new King Henry V reappointed him to that office. This is a tribute to the high regard in which the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Shrewsbury, held him. He also acted as Justiciar of Ireland, following the sudden death of Sir John Stanley, although in view of his age and ill health it was understood that this was only a temporary appointment. As Justiciar he was assisted by a military council, made up of such noted soldiers as the Gascony-born knight Sir Jenico d'Artois.Otway-Ruthve, A.J. History of Medieval Ireland Barnes and Noble reissue 1993 p.348 He became prebendary of Clonmethan in north County Dublin in 1410: in 1414 he was sued by the Crown for recovery of the profits of the prebend for the previous two years, on the grounds that he had been an absentee prebend, but the lawsuit was dismissed when Cranley produced the King's letters patent authorising his absence.John D'Alton History of the County of Dublin 1838 Hodges and Smith In 1417 he was asked to present a memorial on the state of Ireland to the English Crown. He reached England, but he was an old man even by modern standards, and in frail health. The journey proved to be too much for his constitution, and he died at Faringdon in Oxfordshire on 25 May. He was buried in New College, Oxford: the inscription on his tomb hails him as \\"the flower of prelates\\".  Appearance and character  Early historians praised Cranley for both his mental and physical qualities: \\"thou art fair beyond the children of men, grace is diffused through thy lips because of thine eloquence\\" wrote one particularly eloquent admirer. He was described as tall and commanding in appearance, with fair hair and a ruddy complexion; his personality was witty, eloquent and learned. As a cleric, he was described as charitable to the poor, a notable preacher and a great builder of churches.

Ornithopoda =Hadrosauridae= While studying into the chewing methods of hadrosaurids in 2009, the paleontologists Vincent Williams, Paul Barrett, and Mark Purnell found that hadrosaurs likely grazed on horsetails and vegetation close to the ground, rather than browsing higher-growing leaves and twigs. This conclusion was based upon the evenness of scratches on hadrosaur teeth, which suggested the hadrosaur used the same series of jaw motions over and over again. As a result, the study determined that the hadrosaur diet was probably made of leaves and lacked the bulkier items such as twigs or stems, which might have required a different chewing method and created different wear patterns. However, Purnell said these conclusions were less secure than the more conclusive evidence regarding the motion of teeth while chewing. The hypothesis that hadrosaurs were likely grazers rather than browsers appears to contradict previous findings from preserved stomach contents found in the fossilized guts in previous hadrosaurs studies. The most recent such finding before the publication of the Purnell study was conducted in 2008, when a team led by University of Colorado at Boulder graduate student Justin S. Tweet found a homogeneous accumulation of millimeter-scale leaf fragments in the gut region of a well-preserved partially grown Brachylophosaurus. As a result of that finding, Tweet concluded in September 2008 that the animal was likely a browser, not a grazer. In response to such findings, Purnell said preserved stomach contents are questionable because they do not necessarily represent the usual diet of the animal. The issue remains a subject of debate.This information comes from the aforementioned Alan Boyle source from June 29, 2009. However, this specific information is not included in the body of the article, but rather a response by Boyle to comments in the article. Since the comments were written by Boyle himself, and since they cite information he received specifically from Purnell, they are as legitimate a source of information as the article itself. Coprolites (fossilized droppings) of some Late Cretaceous hadrosaurs show that the animals sometimes deliberately ate rotting wood. Wood itself is not nutritious, but decomposing wood would have contained fungi, decomposed wood material and detritus-eating invertebrates, all of which would have been nutritious. Theropoda Golden eagle with a European hare Tyrannosaur tooth marks are the most commonly preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. It is usually not possible to identify tooth marks on bone made by small predatory dinosaurs due to similarities in the denticles on their teeth. However, there are exceptions, like an ornithomimid caudal vertebra that has tooth drag marks attributed to Saurornitholestes and a partial Troodon skeleton with preserved puncture marks. Small bones of small theropods that were preyed upon by larger ones may have been swallowed whole and digested frequently enough to affect their abundance in the fossil record. In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma they are more likely to be a result of the animal's behavior than fractures obtained during a single injurious event. The distribution of stress fractures also has behavioral significance. Stress fractures to the hand are more likely to result from predatory behavior since injuries to the feet could be obtained while running or migrating. In order to identify stress fractures occurring in the feet of Allosaurus specifically due to predatory behavior, the researchers checked to see if the toes which bore the greatest stress while in motion also had the greatest percentage of stress fractures. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would contact the ground first while a theropod was running it would have borne the most stress and should be most predisposed to suffer stress fractures. The lack of such a bias in the examined fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running, like interaction with prey. They suggested that such injuries could occur as a result of the allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. Contact with struggling prey is also the likely cause of tendon avulsions found in the forelimbs of Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. The authors concluded that the presence of stress fractures provide evidence for \\"very active\\" predation- based diets rather than obligate scavenging. =Tyrannosauridae= Tyrannosaur tooth marks are the most commonly preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. They have been reported from ceratopsians, hadrosaurs and other tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurid bones with tooth marks represent about 2% of known fossils with preserved tooth marks. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body, rather than knife-like cutting functions. Tooth wear patterns hint that complex head shaking behaviors may have been involved in tyrannosaur feeding. In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma they are more likely to be a result of the animal's behavior than fractures obtained during a single injurious event. The distribution of stress fractures also has behavioral significance. Stress fractures to the hand are more likely to result from predatory behavior since injuries to the feet could be obtained while running or migrating. The researchers concluded that contact with struggling prey is the likely cause of a tendon avulsion found in the forelimb of the Tyrannosaurus specimen Sue. The authors concluded that the presence of stress fractures in theropods provide evidence for \\"very active\\" predation-based diets rather than obligate scavenging. Saurornitholestes preyed upon by juvenile tyrannosaur Saurornitholestes skeleton. A. R. Jacobsen published a description of a dentary referred to Saurornitholestes with tooth marks. The dentary is about 12 cm long and preserves fifteen tooth positions, ten of these have teeth, with five of those teeth fully erupted and intact, two broken but functional as evidenced by the presence of wearfacets, three are only partially erupted. Three toothmarks were visible on the lingual surface of the dentary. Two of the three marks are series of grooves made by the serrations on the maker's teeth. The first consists of 6-7 parallel grooves within a 4 x 1.3 mm area beneath the alveolus of the third tooth and angled at forty-five degrees to the dentary's longitudinal axis. The striations are between .37 mm and .40 mm thick with cuboidal cross-sections. Gorgosaurus may have inflicted the tooth marks on the Saurornitholestes skull. The second tooth mark lies between the fifth and sixth alveoli and consists of two smaller grooves separated 1.8 and 1.6 mm respectively from a larger central groove, with a V-shaped groove beneath it at an angle of sixty degrees to the longitudinal axis of the jaw. The third mark consists of four parallel grooves in a 2 x 2 mm area on the seventh tooth oriented at ninety degrees to the longitudinal axis of the tooth. The shape of the preserved serrations are too different from those of Saurornitholestes for the marks to be the result of injuries incurred during intraspecific face biting behaviors. Although the right shape for Dromaeosaurus tooth serrations, the preserved marks are too coarse to have been left by that genus. Although a specific identification cannot be made, the most likely perpetrator would be a juvenile individual of one of the Dinosaur Park Formation's tyrannosaurids, like Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, or Aublysodon. Jacobsen determined that all of the marks on the jawbone were left by the same animal because the serration marks all share the same morphology. Deinonychus dismembering a Zephyrosaurus while it was restrained by its talons, as suggested by Fowler et al (2011) =Dromaeosauridae= Saurornitholestes An ornithomimid caudal vertebra has been discovered that has tooth drag marks attributed to Saurornitholestes. Deinonychus Deinonychus, along with other similar dromaeosaurs, were suggested to kill prey in a similar manner to modern accipitrid birds of prey, due to the similarities of their grasping talons. The Deinonychus will pin the prey down with its own weight, restrain it with its hind feet talons, and dismember it with its mouth. Ceratopsia =Ceratopsidae= Chasmosaurus feeds on woody browse. In 1966 John Ostrom postulated that the diet of late Cretaceous chasmosaurs such as Triceratops and Torosaurus fed on very resistant and fibrous materials like the fronds of cycad or palm plants.Ostrom, J.H. (1966), FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF THE CERATOPSIAN DINOSAURS. Evolution, 20: 290-308. doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.1966.tb03367.x By extension, all Ceratopsids had a shearing dentition and efficient, powerful jaw mechanics that allowed them to feed on tough vegetation. Mallon and Anderson postulated that Ankylosaurs and Ceratopsids may have partitioned the herb layer in the Dinosaur Park Formation, or that Ceratopsid feeding height was slightly higher.Mallon, J.C., Evans, D.C., Ryan, M.J. et al. Feeding height stratification among the herbivorous dinosaurs from the Dinosaur Park Formation (upper Campanian) of Alberta, Canada. BMC Ecol 13, 14 (2013). https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-13-14 As well as suggesting that the Ornithopods might have made room for the passing Ceratopsid herds by rising up to avoid ecological competition. Notably, they could not distinguish centrosaurine and chasmosaurine ecology apart, though it is likely present as in other megaherbivore clades.Mallon JC, Anderson JS (2013) Skull Ecomorphology of Megaherbivorous Dinosaurs from the Dinosaur Park Formation (Upper Campanian) of Alberta, Canada. PLoS ONE 8(7): e67182. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067182 The results of a NPMANOVA analysis supported the suggestion that Ceratopsids had the strongest bite force of each of the megaherbivore groups, and able to process the toughest plants available.Mallon, J.C. Competition structured a Late Cretaceous megaherbivorous dinosaur assemblage. Sci Rep 9, 15447 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51709-5 Like Ornithopods and unlike all other dinosaurs, Ceratopsians possessed dental batteries that may have been attributable to their success. In 2019, Mallon noted that stratigraphic overlap in the Dinosaur Park Formation between subfamilial taxa was limited, further supporting chasmosaurine and centrosaurine preferencial differences.

It was located on the immediate border of the town of Gateshead, 2.3 miles from the city of Newcastle upon Tyne. Once described as a \\"dark, spongy moor\\",Surtees, 1820: 110 Gateshead Fell existed in some form for almost nine hundred years before it was enclosed in 1809 and divided into a number of villages, notably Sheriff Hill, Low Fell and Wrekenton, which were themselves absorbed by the urban expansion of Gateshead and were officially incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead with the passing of the Local Government Act in 1974.  History  Gateshead Fell, a constituent part of the ancient County of Durham,Manders, 1973: 307 took its name from nearby Gateshead and the fact that the area was \\"a fell or common contigious to it\\".Lewis, 1848: 284 It has existed in some form for over one thousand years, but little of that early history survives today. Perhaps the most notable occurrence was that in 1068 when Malcolm, King of Scotland, marched across the Scottish border to challenge the authority of William the Conqueror. Malcolm, accompanied by \\"a retinue of native insurgents and foreign auxiliaries\\",Lewis, 1831 :354 was met by William's men and was decisively beaten.Mackensie, 1827: 747. Little of further note is recorded until approximately 1647, when Gateshead Fell was surveyed and found to contain some 1,300 acres. In that lay much of what is now part of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. The northern boundary reached Whinney House and Beacon House, to the south came Wrekendyke, to the east lay the old Roman road and to the west was Chowdene, now ostensibly part of Low Fell, along with what is now Eighton Banks (near Wrekenton). Each boundary was marked by a cross, with some engraved with the inscription \\"I, Christ\\". By the middle of the eighteenth century, Gateshead Fell had become a place of considerable notoriety. Indeed, when John Wesley arrived in Gateshead in February 1745, he noted that: > \\"It was past eight before we got to Gateshead Fell, which appeared a great, > pathless waste of white. The snow filling up and covering all the roads, we > were at a loss as how to proceed, when an honest man of Newcastle overtook > and guided us to safe into the town. Many a rough journey have I had before, > but one like this I never had...\\" By the turn of the 18th century, the essential character of Gateshead Fell had changed very little. Herbage still flourished (composed of \\"whins and briars\\")Manders, 1973: 308 and this formed the modest means for a smattering of tinkers and cuddiesA cuddie is today simply a donkey. who comprised the majority of the population of the Fell.  Industry  Gateshead Fell was dominated by heavy industry. One of the predominant industries was on the fell was quarrying, with one observer noting: > \\"The grindstones from the quarries here, known as \\"Newcastle grindstones,\\" > have been celebrated for centuries, and are exported to all parts of the > world.\\" Tyneside has a rich coal mining heritage and Gateshead Fell was no different in this regard. Roger de Fulthorpe and others, in 1368, worked the coal-mines in \\"Gateside Moore.\\"Hair, 1842 At one time, there were \\"eight pittes on Gateside Low Fell,\\" which accounts for the immense extent of pit-waste on this part of the Fell previous to the division. Ellison Main Colliery (sometimes referred to as Sheriff Hill Colliery) was situated at the summit of Gateshead Fell (now the boundary between Sheriff Hill and Low Fell). Opened in 1793, ownership of the mine changed hands a number of times: in 1840 the lease was granted to \\"messers Hutchinson and Lamb under Cuthbert Ellison\\" Data maintained by the Durham Mining Museum- available online at http://www.dmm.org.uk/mindex.htm.

Brian Pears is a professional academic and a keen local historian. Material available online at http://www.bpears.org.uk/genuki/Collieries/CollsDG.html Far less is known about Hope Pit, another mine which operated in Gateshead Fell (more specifically) and which is evidenced in Ordnance Survey maps up to 1919, but no such listing is evidenced in the map of 1939.Map Number 45, Ordnance Survey of Gateshead, 1939. This was situated in the area now known as Blue Quarries Road and Hewson Street, both of which are now residential areas, and very little documentary evidence regarding this pit survives today.  Social conditions  = Criminality = The Fell, and particularly the turnpike road, had, in spite of its natural beauty,Lewis (1848: 285) states \\"the views present some of the most extensive and beautiful scenery in the North of England\\" earned itself a reputation as something of a haven for neer-do-wells and a place of considerable danger for those unaccustomed to it.Manders, 1973: 309 In 1880, the Monthly Chronicle reflected that: > “Gateshead Fell, as the name implies, was once a wild common, over a portion > of which lay the road between Durham and Newcastle. The loneliness of the > bleak moorland was quite guile enough to invest it with terror to travellers > a hundred years ago and occasionally there were incidents that served > greatly to enhance the evil repute of the locality ”North Country Lore and > Legend, Monthly Chronicle, March 1888 In 1770, Robert Hazlett, a highwayman, was convicted of committing two acts of highway robbery in the same night. In the first instance, he attempted to steal a watch and coins from a lady named Miss Benson. After succeeding in obtaining from the woman her coin purse, Hazlett continued along the turnpike and encountered a postman, who, despite having been forewarned by Miss Benson, was 'lured into a trap' and robbed. Hazlett was tried within one week of his arrest at the Newcastle Assizes and was convicted. He was sentenced to hang until dead. His remains were hung on chains near a pond on the Fell as a warning to other potential, would-be criminals. That pond, named Hazlett’s Pond in dubious honour of the highwayman, has since been drained and enclosed. The Fell was also reportedly the home of minor criminal gangs.Morgan and Rushton, 1998: 93 Local press reports referred often to the actions of a notorious family in the name of Clark and the actions and impact of the so- called Gateshead Fell-Bishop Auckland Gang have been scrutinised.Morgan and Rushton, 1998: 93, para 3 However, the gang had ‘a tenuous identity’ and, despite \\"many arrests, few serious crimes were confirmed in court\\".Morgan and Rushton, 1998: 93–4 It is true, however, that Walter Clark and his wife, Jane Trotter, lived on the Fell and a number of pickpockets arrested around 1780 were associated with that house.Morgan and Rushton, 1998: 94 The Newcastle Chronicle reported in 1786 that one of the gang, Francis Russell, was ‘whipped around the Sandhill’.Manders, 1973: 310 A number of other individuals were pursued for other minor acts of criminality, such as stealing geese or killing sheep.Morgan and Rushton, 1998: 94, para 2 These incidents gained something of a local reputation for individuals such as Thomas Colpits, who was arrested on several occasions and found himself reported in the local press. The modus operandi of these ‘gangs’ was that “they often changed their names and frequently rendezvous at the Crown and the Cannon at Gateshead Fell and had ware rooms for their stolen goods...”Morgan and Rushton, 1998: 93, para 2 It seems likely that these acts were the sporadic acts of associated ‘tinkers’ rather than an organised gang of criminals: ‘there was no evidence of definite ringleaders or organisation’.Morgan and Rushton, 1998: 94, para 3 = Religion = Gateshead Fell was once one of the strongest seats of Methodism in the whole of England.Manders, 1973 :148 This is due almost entirely to the visit of John Wesley, the joint founder of the Methodist movement, in March 1743. It is said that he was returning from Pelton to Newcastle when \\"...he observed a little village called Chowden [now Chowdene], which they told me consisted of colliers only. I resolved to preach there as soon as possible, for these are sinners and need repentance.\\"Manders, 1973: 148 He duly returned on 8 March 1743, was moved by the amazement of the local children (who he described as \\"neither clothed or naked\\" to his presence and duly began his preachings.Manders, 1973: 149 In doing so, Wesley ensured that Methodism was bourne on the Fell. Curiously, the Gateshead Fell movement quickly disassociated itself from the Newcastle circuit and formed itself into a strong, separate existenceManders, 1973: 149 at para 2 so that by 1840, well attended Wesleyan services were being held in Carr Hill, Low Fell and in Sheriff HillManders, 1973: 149 at para 3  Demise = Boundary Disputes = Gateshead Fell has been described as 'uninhabitable waste'Manders, 1973: 307, para 1 which made the frequent boundary disputes somewhat perplexing.Manders, 1973: 307, para 2 In 1595, for example, when commissioners riding on behalf of the Bishop of Durham rode along the boundary they were harangued by local residents and then confronted by the primary local landowners, William Gascoigne and John Hedworth, who rode on horseback in a fury to confront the transgressors and threatened death by rapier upon all of them.Manders, 1973: 307–308 The commissioners evidently believed them, and duly fled. Rather more amicable challenges to the boundaries came through the courts, including that raised by the Bishop of Durham against Sir Henry Liddell in 1714.Manders, 1973: 308, para 2 The Bishop of Durham, suspected of having a close friendship with the notorious Jacobite Thomas Forster, duly lost his case on appeal in 1717, the Court evidently finding the evidence of Liddell, a staunch Royalist, much more to their liking. On no fewer than three separate occasions, in 1691, 1735 and 1778, were recommendations made to enclose Gateshead Fell, but none of them made it any further than a mere proposal.Manders, 1973: 308, para 3 These proposals, raised by a succession of Lords, were repeatedly rebuffed by the efforts of the local borough holders . Yet in spite of the official failures to enclose the land, It seems likely that unofficial encroachments must have slowly nibbled away at the Fell, for by the time enclosure was actually undertaken in 1809, the size of Gateshead Fell had officially shrunken to a mere 631 acres. = Enclosure = In 1809 an Act was finally obtained ordering the enclosure of Gateshead Fell. Enclosure was completed in 1822.Carlton, 1974: 114. Commissioners were appointed to settle claims in land and to apportion the Fell accordingly. The commissioners were empowered to set out such parts as they pleased for roads, drains, quarries, watering places, and one acre as a church-yard: of the residue, one-sixteenth part was appropriated to the bishop of Durham as lord of the manor, and another sixteenth part to the boroughholders and freemen of Gateshead, in compensation for their exclusive right of letting stints: the rest of the Fell (except a part for making two waggon-ways) was divided amongst persons having right of common. The whole Fell contained 631 acres, 0 roods, 21 poles, exclusive of roads, quarries and wells.McKenzie, 1827: 750 This proved a lengthy process and dozens of contested issues were raised in court. Once these had been settled, plans were laid for the requisition and construction of wells, quarries, drains, roads, watering places and other essential requirements. New roads were to be built on what is now Blue Quarries Road, Church Road and Windy Nook Road to supplement the turnpike road which was to remain in spite of the development of a new turnpike road along the route which is now Durham Road, running from Newcastle to Durham through Low Fell. The new road was completed in 1827. A well was also to be provided at Blue Quarries. A number of the existing residential properties on the Fell were demolished, including sixteen at Sour Milk Hill, Sheriff Hill; an act which apparently had caused the commissioner considerable distress, with one Thomas Bell noting: > ...the pulling down of these cottages was one of the most unpleasant duties > of the Commissioners, the greater number having to be taken down by > force.Manders, 1973: 309–310 Progress was slow, with the last allotment land disputes not settled until almost 1830, but by the time of completion, Gateshead Fell was, at last and after centuries of dispute, enclosed. The divisions which enclosure created were to prove more or less settled: so much so that almost two hundred years later, the old Fell remains divided almost exactly as enclosed, and it was from the enclosure sprang the birth of villages (notably Sheriff Hill and Low Fell) which form part of the metropolitan borough of Gateshead today.

Located on a hill in the vicinity of the village, the church dates to the 6th century and was first described in the 19th century. It features three naves and three apses as well as a baptistery. Notably, instead of a dome it was covered by a vaulted roof. Location and history The basilica is located on the Spasovitsa Hill (or Holy Savior's Hill) to the south of Golyamo Belovo and south of the town of Belovo. The church is accessible via a road which starts to the east of the village and passes some of its fruit orchards. Built in the first half of the 6th century, the church has been only partially preserved to this day. Among the sections that are still standing are the north arcade, the south wall of the narthex and monumental west facade. The church was first described in the 19th century by Bulgarian National Revival enlighteners Stefan Zahariev and Petko Slaveykov, followed by a scholarly description by historian Petar Mutafchiev in 1915. The earliest professional excavations of the church's ruins date to 1924. These were financed by American scholar Thomas Whittemore and carried out by art historian André Grabar. Since 1927, the church has been under state protection as a national antiquity, and in 1966 it was classified as a cultural monument of national importance. In 1994, the basilica underwent partial reconstruction. Architecture The chief material employed in the Belovo Basilica's construction were square bricks joined together with mortar. The basilica measures . The interior is divided into three naves by two rows of fours columns each running through the middle of the church. Each of the naves has an apse at its east end. The apses are of a semicircular design; the middle apse, the largest of the three, houses a three-tiered synthronon (stone benches for the clergy). The western section of the church includes a narthex, which has a baptistery with three semi-domes attached to its south wall. There are several entrances to the church, none of which can be considered the main entrance. The basilica is not topped by a dome. Rather, a row of baldachin- like arches acted as its roof. This feature of the basilica's architecture sets it apart from most other examples of early Christian architecture in the Balkans. While architecture historian Stanford Anderson considers the ruins to be characteristic for the architecture of modern Bulgaria at the time, Bulgarian archaeologist Krastyu Miyatev believes it to be radically different from Bulgaria's other preserved basilicas of the same period. Architecture historian Stefan Stamov likens the Belovo Basilica's plan to that of Mediterranean basilicas and presents the opinion that it was influenced by construction techniques from Asia Minor. The construction materials are, however, typical for the Bulgarian lands.

Notable cases and rulings =State of Utah in the interest of ACC= Case No. 20000596, 2002 04.22 6 In 1998, Judge Oddone heard a case involving a minor who was claiming to have been the subject of an illegal search. The Judge decided that, as a minor, the accused was not accorded the same rights to privacy as would be accorded an adult. The Judge's decision was subsequently overturned by the Utah Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals ruled that the accused did have a reasonable expectation of privacy, and therefore, ruled that the search was unlawful. A certiorari petition was sent to and accepted by the Utah State Supreme Court. The Supreme Court then found, in a 5-0 ruling, that the accused had no reasonable expectation of privacy . The Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the appellate court and agreed with Judge Oddone's original ruling on the matter. =State v. Heidi Mattingly= In January 2005, Judge Oddone was assigned by the presiding judge of the Utah Juvenile Court to review a videotaped interview entered as evidence in a custody case between the State of Utah and Heidi Mattingly-Foster. Mattingly-Foster, one wife within a known polygamist family, was placed on trial after reportedly abusing her ten children and using her children as leverage. Judge Oddone's participation in the case stemmed from a need to review a videotaped interview with one of the children. The interview was obtained through a different, criminal investigation. The State of Utah was hesitant to give Mattingly-Foster a copy of the interview, unsure as to whether she would use the evidence for unsavory reasons. Judge Oddone was assigned to review the tape to determine whether any information contained within had any bearing on the custody case. =MN v State= Case No. 2005009, 2005 Ut. App. 146 In 2005, a case that originally sat before Judge Oddone was sent to the Utah Court of Appeals. In this situation, Judge Oddone had terminated that parental rights of the defendant, after reviewing the prosecution's evidence of \\"neglect, unfitness, and failure to remedy the circumstances\\". The defendant appealed the termination of her parental rights, claiming that the prosecution did not present sufficient evidence to prove the charges. The Utah Court of Appeals upheld Judge Oddone's decision, stating that the juvenile court is given a \\"'wide latitude of discretion as to the judgments arrived at' based upon not only the court's opportunity to judge credibility firsthand, but also based on the juvenile court judges' 'special training, experience and interest in this field,'\\". =State of Utah, in the interest of L.P., a person under eighteen years of age= Case No. 20080396, 2009 Ut. App. 42 In 2009, another of Judge Oddone's cases was appealed to the Utah Court of Appeals. The defendant appealed the Judge's original decision to terminate his parental rights. The Utah Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Oddone's original decision to terminate the parental rights of the father and affirmed the finding that the father was an unfit parent.http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/juv/JV_lp022009.pdf Personal life Judge Oddone is married.Facebook, https://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=571449442 The Judge is also an avid basketball fan, making a point of attending every NCAA tournament game held at the University of Utah's Huntsman Center, a tradition dating back to 1979.

Life Finch was the son of Francis Finch, a merchant in Friday Street, Cheapside, London, was born on 22 November 1802, and spent his boyhood at Stone, near Aylesbury. When twelve years of age, at that time fatherless, he was placed under John Varley, with whom he worked altogether five years, a friend having paid a premium of £200. Among his earliest patrons was John Rushout, 2nd Baron NorthwickLord Northwick , a patron of the fine arts, who employed FInch in making views of his mansion and grounds. Some time after leaving his master's studio the same friend who had assisted in placing him there afforded him the benefit of a tour through Scotland. After his return he doubted for some time whether he should continue the practice of landscape or enter as a student at the Royal Academy. He joined Sass's life academy and produced several portraits, but circumstances drawing him back to landscape- painting he became a candidate for admission into the then newly formed Society of Painters in Water Colours. On 11 February 1822 he was elected an associate, and on 4 June 1827 a member of that society. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817, at that period living at 44 Conduit Street, Bond Street. He married in the spring of 1837, and lived in Charlotte Street for some time, and later in Argyle Square, Euston Road. He possessed a fine voice, and was a talented musician, and a poet. He printed a collection of sonnets entitled An Artist's Dream. Works Among his best works may be counted Garmallon's Tomb, (oil 1820); View of Loch Lomond (1822); View on the River Tay (1827); View of Windsor Castle (1829); View of the College of Aberdeen (1832); The Dell of Comus (1835); Alpine Scene, Evening (1838); A Watch Tower (1840); The Thames near Cookham, Berkshire (1845); Ruined Temple, Evening (1852); Rocky Glen, Evening (1855); The Curfew - Gray's Elegy (1860); Pastoral Retreat (1861); and Moonlight over the Sea (1862).

Apker (June 11, 1915 – July 5, 1970) was an American experimental physicist. Along with his colleagues E. A. Taft and Jean Dickey, he studied the photoelectric emission of electrons from semiconductors and discovered the phenomenon of exciton-induced photoemission in potassium iodide. In 1955, he received the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize of the American Physical Society for his work. Biography Born in Rochester, New York on June 11, 1915, Apker attended the University of Rochester, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1937. He then commenced graduate studies there under Lee Alvin DuBridge, along with fellow graduate students Ernest Courant, Esther M. Conwell, Robert H. Dicke, and others. He received his Ph.D. in physics in 1941. Also in 1941, he began working for the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York. On July 5, 1970, he was found by his wife, suffering from a gunshot wound to the head on the driveway of his home. He was taken to a hospital in Schenectady, where he later died. Research =Photoelectric effect in semiconductors= While at General Electric, he began to research the photoelectric effect, which causes matter to emit electrons when exposed to some types of electromagnetic radiation. In 1916 Robert Andrews Millikan, while verifying the photoelectric equations of Albert Einstein, had proposed the idea that photoelectrons emitted from semiconductors should behave in a different way than those emitted from other types of matter, and a very similar theory was advanced by Edward Condon in 1938. In 1948 Apker, working with E. A. Taft and J. E. Dickey, he completed experiments that confirmed Condon's theory. The main discovery made was that photoelectrons from some semiconductors moved much slower than photoelectrons from metals with the same work function, an unexpected result which was used to increase understanding of the electronic structure of semiconductors. =Flash filament method= Apker was also active in the field of vacuum science. In 1948 he developed the flash filament method for measuring very low pressures, which was the first widely used method for measuring pressures less than 10^-8 Torr. In this method, a gas is allowed to adsorb onto a clean tungsten filament for a set amount of time, and the filament is then rapidly heated. The gas adsorbed onto the filament is released, and the resulting pressure burst can be measured. Though very time consuming, the flash filament method was later used for thermal desorption spectroscopy. =Potassium iodide= Apker followed up his work on the photoelectric effect with an investigation of the photoelectric properties of the alkali halides, particularly potassium iodide. In potassium iodide, an ionic crystal, some iodide ions can be removed and their vacant places will be filled by electrons. Called \\"F-Centers,\\" these defects absorb visible and ultraviolet light, coloring the crystals at photon energies where they are usually transparent. Additionally, the absorption of visible radiation can free trapped electrons inside the crystal and produce photoconductivity. Apker found that in addition to visible radiation, near-ultraviolet radiation also produces photoconductitivty. Deeper into the ultraviolet spectrum, however, potassium iodide has a strong absorption line due to the formation of chargeless particles called excitons. These excitons transfer energy to the electrons in the F-Centers with remarkably high efficiency, and these excited electrons are excited from the crystals in exciton-induced photoemission. Apker observed the same sort of behavior in other crystals such as barium oxide. Legacy In 1978, Apker's wife and colleague Jean Dickey Apker established the LeRoy Apker Award of the American Physical Society in memory of Apker. The award is presented to two college undergraduates each year.

This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called target archery. A form particularly popular in Europe and America is field archery, shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms, as well as archery novelty games. The World Archery Federation (WA, also and formerly known as FITA from the French Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc), composed of 156 national federations and other archery associations, is the governing body recognized by the International Olympic Committee. Various other large organizations exist with different rules. Target archery Outdoor target competition. Modern competitive target archery is often governed by the World Archery Federation, abbreviated as WA (sometimes also referred to as FITA, from its former French name of Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc). Olympic rules are derived from WA rules. Target archery competitions may be held indoors or outdoors. Indoor distances are . Outdoor distances range from . Competition is divided into ends of 3 or 6 arrows. After each end, the competitors walk to the target to score and retrieve their arrows. Archers have a set time limit in which to shoot their arrows. 3 arrows are shot in 2 minutes, and 6 in 4 minutes. Targets are marked with 10 evenly spaced concentric rings, which have score values from 1 through 10 assigned to them. In addition, there is an inner 10 ring, sometimes called the X ring. This becomes the 10 ring at indoor compound competitions. Outdoors, it serves as a tiebreaker with the archer scoring the most X's winning. Archers score each end by summing the scores for their arrows. Line breakers, an arrow just touching a scoring boundary line, will be awarded the higher score. In the past, most targets in competitive archery use some kind of stalks of grain or grass and may be constructed of marsh grass woven into a rope then wrapped around into a target. \\"Bull's-eye Builder\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1952, pp. 126-127. However, in modern times, most archery targets are made of synthetic foam, or woven plastic bags stuffed with cloth. Different rounds and distances use different size target faces. These range from ( WA Indoor) to ( and WA, used in Olympic competition). Field archery A field archer shooting freestyle recurve at . Field archery involves shooting at targets of varying (and sometimes unmarked) distance, often in rough terrain. Three common types of rounds (in the NFAA) are the field, hunter, and animal. A round consists of 28 targets in two units of 14 (until the early 60's two rounds of 28 were shot for 56 targets). Field rounds are at 'even' distances up to (some of the shortest are measured in feet instead), using targets with a black bullseye (5 points), a white center (4) ring, and black outer (3) ring. Hunter rounds use 'uneven' distances up to , and although scoring is identical to a field round, the target has an all- black face with a white bullseye. Children and youth positions for these two rounds are closer, no more than , respectively. Animal rounds use life-size 2D animal targets with 'uneven' distances reminiscent of the hunter round. The rules and scoring are also significantly different. The archer begins at the first station of the target and shoot their first arrow. If it hits, they do not have to shoot again. If it misses, they advance to station two and shoots a second arrow, then to station three for a third if needed. Scoring areas are vital (20, 16, or 12) and nonvital (18, 14, or 10) with points awarded depending on which arrow scored first. Again, children and youth shoot from reduced range. One goal of field archery is to improve the technique required for bowhunting in a more realistic outdoor setting, but without introducing the complication and guesswork of unknown distances. As with golf, fatigue can be an issue as the athlete walks the distance between targets across sometimes rough terrain. A home-made Archery target IFAA Field and International rounds are used in European Professional Archery competition. Other modern competitions The following are listed on the WA website. These competitions are not as popular as the two listed above, but they are competed internationally. =3D archery= 3D archery is a subset of field archery focusing on shooting at life-size models of game and is popular with hunters. It is most common to see unmarked distances in 3D archery, as the goal is to accurately recreate a hunting environment for competition. Though the goal is hunting practice, hunting broadheads are not used, as they would tear up the foam targets too much. Normal target or field tips, of the same weight as the intended broadhead, are used instead. In the past 10 years 3D archery has taken new light with a competitive edge. There is a whole new group of competitions that are no longer considered hunting practice. Competitions are held in many U.S. states with the totals from each state being added together to crown a single winner within each division. Some competitors will travel thousands of miles (kilometers) a year to compete to try and claim the world title in 3D archery. This competitive style has been growing in many other countries and should continue with strong support for many years to come. The major 3D archery groups are the IBO (International Bowhunting Organization) and the ASA (American Shooters Association) are primarily based in Eastern United States. They each have different rules and scoring methods. They host a number of competitive shoots across the Eastern United States. There are several classes in each organization that range from hunter all the way up to professional classes. Each class shoots at maximum yardages that vary by class. =Clout archery (G.N.A.S. rules in the United Kingdom)= Archers shooting clout. Similar to target archery, except that the archer attempts to drop arrows at long range ( for the men and for women; there are shorter distances for juniors depending on age) into a group of concentric circular scoring zones on the ground surrounding a marker flag. Traditional clout archery, up to Elizabethan times, was shot at 'twelve score', . The flag is square and is fixed to a stick. The flag should be as near to the ground as is practicable. Archers shoot 'ends' of six arrows then, when given the signal to do so, archers proceed to the target area. A Clout round usually consists of 36 arrows. Clout tournaments are usually a 'Double Clout' round (36 arrows shot twice). They can be shot in one direction (one way) or both directions (two way). All bow types may compete (longbows, recurve, barebow and compound). * Scoring. A 'rope' with a loop on the end is placed over the flag stick. This rope is divided into the scoring zones of the target: Gold (5 points), Red (4 points), Blue (3 points), Black (2 points) and White (1 point). The rope is 'walked' around the target area and arrows falling within a particular scoring zone are withdrawn and, on completion of the full circle, are laid out on the rope on the corresponding colours. The designated scorer would then call out the archers' names and the archers would (in turn) call out their scores as they pick up their arrows. The scores must be called in descending order as with target archery. =Crossbow archery (IAU rules internationally)= IAU 'Field' crossbow archery The International Crossbow- shooting Union (Internationale Armbrustschutzen Union – IAU) was founded in Landshut, Germany, on June 24, 1956, as the world governing body for crossbow target shooting. The IAU supervises World, Continental and International crossbow shooting championships in 3 disciplines; Match-crossbow, Match- crossbow and Field-crossbow archery. IAU World Championships take place every two years with Continental Championships on intervening years. Other International and IAU-Cup events take place annually. Field-crossbow archery was first adopted by the IAU during their General Assembly at Frütigen, Switzerland in 1977. Since then the sport has become the most popular, in terms of worldwide activity, of the IAU's three target crossbow disciplines. A feature of this sport is that many crossbow archers make their own equipment. By following the detailed guidelines issued by the IAU's Technical Committee it is possible to construct a field crossbow from locally available archery materials and target shooting accessories. The IAU's Field regulations call for the wearing of light-weight sports clothing, thereby eliminating the need for specialized (and costly) shooting clothing. Shooting takes place on open sports fields or in sports halls using portable archery target buttresses, once again avoiding the need for the expense of permanent shooting ranges (subject to IAU and local safety regulations being met). Crossbow archers shoot from the standing position and they must draw the bow string by hand without mechanical assistance. At outdoor competitions Bolts (arrows) are shot in \\"ends\\" (series) of three at multi-coloured 10-zone archery target faces. A time limit of three minutes is allowed per three shots. After a sound signal from the official in charge of shooting, all competitors walk forward together to score and collect their bolts from the targets. This sequence is repeated until the completion of the competition 'round'. A typical Field- crossbowEquipment – Field-crossbows are designed to specifications laid-down by the International Crossbow-shooting Union (IAU). These rules limit the power, weight and physical dimensions of equipment for use in archery-style competition. Other restrictions include the use of mechanical triggers and open sights only. The bowstring has to be drawn by hand without the use of mechanical assistance. The materials used in construction include laminated hardwoods, aluminium alloy and composites. The prod, or bow, is usually made from laminated carbon-fibre or glass-fibre which is fitted with a bowstring made from synthetic fibres. The maximum permitted draw weight is at a maximum power stroke of . Shooting a bolt this set up will generate an initial velocity of around . Field crossbow bolts are made from tubular aluminium or carbon-fibre archery shaft materials. The majority of the crossbows used in this sport are custom made in small quantities, often by the archers themselves.

In flight archery, the aim is to shoot the greatest distance; accuracy or penetrating power are not relevant. It requires a large flat area such as an aerodrome; the Ottoman Empire established an \\"arrow field\\" (Ok-Meidan) in Istanbul and there were others in several major cities. Turkish flight archery astonished early modern Europeans, whose wooden longbows and heavy arrows had much shorter maximum ranges; in 1795 Mahmoud Effendi, a secretary at the Turkish Embassy in London, made a shot of on Finsbury Fields, and reportedly apologised for an indifferent performance by Turkish standards. Modern rules have flight archers shooting in various classes and weights. Generally they shoot six arrows at each \\"end\\" and then search for all of them. Only four ends are usual in one shoot (as per UK rules – in the US only one end is permitted). At the end of the shoot, archers stay by or mark their furthest arrows while judges and their assistants measure the distances achieved. Flight archery relies on the finest in performance equipment, optimized for the single purpose of greater range, using various types of bows (some unusual such as foot bows). The search for better flight archery equipment has led to many developments in archery equipment in general, such as the development of carbon arrows. Flight archery arrows are highly specialized. They are very short (Mahmoud Effendi's was only ), so that the point of the arrow is inside the arc of the fully drawn bow, requiring a support projecting back from the bow towards the archer to keep the arrow in position, or the use of a 'siper' (Turkish) on the bow hand/wrist on which to rest the arrow. R P Elmer Target Archery Also, the shafts are 'barrelled', tapering towards both ends from the middle, to reduce both weight and air resistance. =Ski archery= An event very similar to the sport of biathlon except a recurve bow is used in place of a gun. The athletes ski around a cross-country track and there are two stances in which the athlete must shoot the targets: kneeling and standing. During competition the skis may not be removed at any time. The athlete may unfasten the ski when shooting in the kneeling position but must keep the foot in contact with the ski. The shooting distance is and the targets in diameter. In certain events, for every missed target, the athlete must ski one penalty loop. The loop is long. In summer or regions with little snow, the European run archery is a mentionable alternative. = Traditional competitions = The following are not listed on the WA website but are competitions that have a long tradition in their respective countries. Beursault A traditional northern French and Belgian archery contest. Archers teams shoot alternately at two targets facing each other, away. A perpendicular array of wooden walls secures a path parallel to the shooting range. After each round, the archers take their own arrow and shoot directly in the opposite direction (thus having opposite windage). One always shoots the same arrow, supposedly the best built, as it was difficult in medieval times to have constant arrow quality. The round black-and-white target mimics the size of a soldier: its diameter is shoulder- wide, the center is heart-sized. Popinjay (or Papingo) Two papingos in the Kilwinning Abbey tower museum, Scotland. A form of archery originally derived from shooting birds on church steeples. Popinjay is popular in Belgium, and in Belgian Clubs internationally but little known elsewhere. Traditionally, archers stand within of the bottom of a mast and shoot almost vertically upwards with 'blunts' (arrows with rubber caps on the front instead of a point), and 'flu-flu' fletchings (very large, wound round the shaft to quickly reduce speed and distance of flight) the object being to dislodge any one of a number of wooden 'birds'. These birds must be one Cock, four Hens, and a minimum of twenty-four Chicks. A Cock scores 5 points when hit and knocked off its perch; a Hen, 3; and a Chick, 1 point. A horizontal variation with Flemish origins also exists and is also practiced in Canada and the United States A Papingo is also hosted during the summer in Scotland by the Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers. The archers shoot at a wooden bird suspended from the steeple of Kilwinning Abbey. Here only one bird is the target, and the archers take it in turn to shoot with a longbow until the \\"bird\\" is shot down. Roving marks Roving marks is the oldest form of competitive archery, as practiced by Henry VIII. The archers will shoot to a \\"mark\\" then shoot from that mark to another mark. A mark is a post or flag to be aimed at. As with clout a rope or ribbon is used to score the arrows. In the Finsbury Mark the scoring system is 20 for hitting the mark, 12 for within ~, 7 points for within the next ~ and 3 points for within the next ~. \\"Hoyles\\" are marks that are chosen at the time from the variety of debris, conspicuous weeds, and so on found in most outdoor areas. As the distances have to be estimated this is good practice for bowhunting, and it requires minimal equipment. Wand shoot A traditional English archery contest. Archers take turns shooting at a vertical strip of wood, the wand, usually about high and wide. Points are awarded for hitting the strip. As the target is a long vertical strip this competition allows for more errors in elevation, however since no points are awarded for near misses the archer's windage accuracy becomes more important. The wand shoot is, in some respects, similar to the traditional Cherokee game of cornstalk shooting. =Other competitions= Archers often enjoy adding variety to their sport by shooting under unusual conditions or by imposing other special restrictions or rules on the event. These competitions are often less formalized and are more or less considered as games. Some forms include the broadhead round, bionic and running bucks, darts, archery golf, night shooting, and turkey tester. =Historical reenactment= Four reenactors practice Tudor-style 'Skirmish' archery Archery is popularly used in historical reenactment events. This sort of event usually combines education of the audience about aspects of archery (such as the bow, arrows, and practice drill), combined with a demonstration or competition of archery in the style most favored by the period on display, generally in period costume. =Archery education= A relatively new program has developed in U.S. schools called the National Archery in Schools Program (NASP). In this students use Genesis bows (a compound-style bow without a let-off). Students or teams who want to can also go to state and national tournaments to compete against other schools. Though it started in United States, it has begun to spread to other countries. Many sportsman's clubs and similar establishments throughout the US and other countries offer archery education programs for those 20 and younger. These programs are commonly referred to as Junior Olympic Archery Development Programs, or simply JOAD. There are over 250 JOAD Clubs recognized by USA Archery. 4-H is also offering archery as an activity for those under 18. Usually members have to have certain requirements for the bows they shoot (ex. use a Genesis Bow, no sights, no release, etc.). Members of archery 4-H clubs and those who use archery as their project can compete in target archery and field archery competitions. Archery with humans as targets, or very near the target Demonstrations of archery skill are sometimes featured as entertainment in circuses or Wild West shows. Sometimes these acts feature a performer acting as a human \\"target\\" (strictly speaking they are not the target as the objective of the archer is to narrowly miss them, however they are frequently referred to as human targets). Archery in this context is sometimes known as one of the \\"impalement arts\\", a category which also includes knife throwing and sharpshooting demonstrations. Apache boys were trained to protect themselves by giving them a shield and having several warriors shoot at them with blunt arrows, which can still do severe damage. In some recreational groups, a form of archery known as combat archery is practiced, where several archers divided into \\"lights\\" and \\"heavies\\", namely those wearing armour or not, shoot at each other with cushion-tipped arrows from low-powered longbows, with a maximum draw-weight of . The rules of combat archery dictate that no archer may shoot at a light, however all may shoot at a heavy. Combat archery can be an interesting challenge for participants, as it involves shooting at moving targets, and can be used to re-create battles. In Australia, it is more common for 'lights' to wear enough protection that they can shoot at each other as well. It is important to note the strict separation between archery practised as a competitive sport and archery as an impalement art. For example, organising bodies for competitive archery prohibit activity that involves deliberate shooting in the general direction of a human being.For example, impalement arts contravene rules 101(b) and 102(a) of the UK Grand National Archery Society (GNAS) Rules of Shooting (see ) and represent \\"substantial\\" or \\"intolerable\\" risk under GNAS Archery range health and safety policy (see ) The separation between the worlds of competition archery and the impalement arts is more marked than that between, for example, knife throwing as a sport and as an entertainment. While some competition knife throwers have also performed circus acts and there are official organisations that embrace both worlds, there is little or no evidence of such crossover in archery, with perhaps the sole exception of reenactment groups (e.g. Society for Creative Anachronism), where archers can both compete in a tournament (target archery) and participate in combat archery, shooting with light bows and special safety arrows at well armoured warriors (often knights). However archery involving a person in the vicinity of the target is a particularly dangerous practice and, even with very experienced performers, there have been cases of very serious injury. Another situation where archery features as an entertainment is in its portrayal in movies. Howard Hill used his extraordinary accuracy for the archery in the movie The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) starring Errol Flynn. He used a heavy hunting bow to hit small reinforced target areas on the chests of actors in motion. Hill also performed stunts such as shooting an apple held by a volunteer and shooting a stone as it was thrown in the air. Some of his stunts can be seen in the short film Cavalcade of Archery (1946).

Its topic is expatriate Earthmen living on an alien planet, and their daily hardships in dealing with their status as a minority group among aliens. The story first appeared in 1955 in the form of a novella, entitled \\"The Earth Quarter\\", in If magazine . An expanded version was published by Ace in 1961, bound dos-à-dos with G. McDonald Wallis's The Light of Lilith as Ace Double F-108. It was reissued under its original title in the omnibus World Without Children and The Earth Quarter; and in the UK under the original title in the omnibus Two Novels. Synopsis In the future, Earth has been devastated by war and disease and supports only a primitive agrarian society. Most Earthmen live elsewhere, as émigrés on planets that are populated by alien species. The author suggests that the human species is the only one plagued by \\"original sin\\", i.e. by an innate tendency to lie, cheat, kill; aliens have come to accept these traits without understanding them. The story takes place among a group of humans in the \\"Earth Quarter\\", a ghetto on the planet Palu that is populated by an insect-like alien race called the Niori. The story opens with a visit by a representative of a political group, the \\"Minority People's League\\", which endorses the return of humans to their ancestral planet and accommodation with the aliens. The envoy is attacked and murdered by a group of thugs who see all aliens as inferior to humans and who seek retribution for humans' second-class status. Their leader, Rack, commandeers a space ship and convinces a group from the Quarter to follow him as he establishes a new colony on an uninhabited planet. Instead, Rack puts them to work building \\"total-conversion bombs\\" and begins a campaign of using the bombs to destroy the suns of alien solar systems (hence the \\"sun saboteurs\\" of the title). Eventually Rack is stopped by a fleet of galactic (alien) ships, but he barely escapes and returns to Palu. The humans murder him, but are nevertheless forced by the Niori to leave. At the story's close, the humans are preparing to board a ship for Earth.

Schreiber (born 1946) is an immunologist and currently is the Alumni Endowed Professor of Pathology and Immunology at Washington University School of Medicine. Schreiber has led a major revision in our understanding of how the immune system interacts with cancer. His work on the cancer immunoeditingDunn, GP, Old, LJ and Schreiber, RD. \\"The three E's of cancer immunoediting\\", Annu Rev Immunol, 22:329, 2004 hypothesis has helped reveal that the immune system is not only capable of destroying cancers, but can also drive them into a dormant state that, in some cases, results in an improved state of malignancy. Education & early career Schreiber obtained his B.A. and PhD in biochemistry from the State University of New York at Buffalo. His postdoctoral training was with Han Mueller-Eberhart at the Scripps Clinic studying the complement system. He joined the Scripps faculty in 1976 and rose to associate member with tenure at Scripps before joining Washington University in St. Louis as Professor of Pathology. He was given the Alumni Endowed Professorship in 1990 and became an Affiliate of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in 2001. Area of expertise Schreiber's work focuses on the concept of immune surveillance in cancer pathogenesis. For over 50 years, scientists have argued about the role of the immune system in preventing the initiation of cancer. The original immune surveillance hypothesis proposed that tumor cells arise naturally and are normally eradicated by the immune system. Tumors would, therefore, only arise if the tumor could develop a mechanism to evade the immune system, or if the immune system were compromised. This hypothesis was directly tested in a landmark paper published by Osias Stutman (1974).Stutman, O. \\"Tumor development after 3-methylcholanthrene in immunologically deficient athymic-nude mice\\", Science 183:1534, 1974 In this paper, Stutman tested whether athymic, nude mice which lack an adaptive immune system have an increased incidence of tumors. His finding that the incidence of tumor formation was the same in nude mice, as compared to wild type mice, led to the strong belief, for over 20 years, that the immune system played no role in preventing the initiation or the prevention of tumors. This finding was consistent with the idea that most tumors arise in individuals with normal immune systems. With the explosion of new information about the role of the innate immune system over the last two decades, and with the knowledge that the innate immune system was intact in the nude mice that Stutman had used, Schreiber repeated these experiments using a strain of mice he bred to lack both innate and adaptive immunity. These mice lacked the recombination activating gene (RAG) required for adaptive immune responses and the STAT1 gene that is required for innate responses. Schreiber's lab was the first to generate STAT1 deficient mice and has worked to characterize the important role of this gene in innate immunity.Meraz, M.A., et al., \\"Targeted disruption of the Stat1 gene in mice reveals unexpected physiologic specificity in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway\\", Cell, 84:431, 1996 In 2001, in a landmark paper, Schreiber reported that RAG2 knockout mice, which lack an adaptive immune system (T and B cells), had a dramatically increased rate of tumor formation compared to wild type mice.Shankaran, V. et al., \\"IFN-gamma and lymphocytes prevent primary tumour development and shape tumour immunogenicity\\"., Nature 410:1107, 2001 This study invalidated the conclusions of the Stutman study, and revived the idea that the immune system could play a critical role. Subsequent work showed that tumors escape immune recognition by losing their antigenicity in a process he named cancer immunoediting. These studies have been critical in forming the scientific basis of many of the immune mediated strategies currently being tested in patients as anti-tumor regimens. Not only do these studies confirm that the immune system can, in fact, play an important role in destroying tumors, but they support the idea that better understanding of immunological recognition and regulation will lead to breakthroughs in our ability to eradicate tumors using the immune system.

The fortifications were probably built in the middle of the 12th century. At the beginning of the 14th century, the south- western tower gate and the northern keep appear to have been built by Jofroit d'Ansembourg. Since the times of Jakob II de Raville-Ansembourg, the castle does not appear to have been significantly altered. The main entrance bears the date of 1565. In 1683, the castle was damaged by the French troops of Marshal de Boufflers.

He wrote for 41 films between 1934 and 1964. Life and career Veiller was born on 23 June 1903 in New York City to playwright and screenwriter Bayard Veiller and English-born actress Margaret Wycherly. He moved to Hollywood in 1930. Veiller was twice nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay. In 1937, he co-wrote (with Morrie Ryskind) the screenplay for Stage Door, starring Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers and Adolphe Menjou. This very loose adaptation of the play by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Veiller was also Oscar-nominated for writing (with uncredited help from John Huston and Richard Brooks) The Killers (1946), an adaptation of the short story by Ernest Hemingway. The film introduced Burt Lancaster to filmgoers, and won an Edgar Award as best mystery film of 1946. In 2008, it was included in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. During the Second World War he worked with Frank Capra on several films in the documentary/propaganda film series collectively titled Why We Fight. In 1946 (the same year as The Killers), Veiller co-wrote The Stranger, directed by and starring Orson Welles. For State of the Union (1948), again directed by Capra, Veiller was credited as co-producer as well as co-writer. Veiller worked with director John Huston on several films: Moulin Rouge (1952), Beat the Devil (1953), The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), and The Night of the Iguana (1964), the film of the Tennessee Williams play that became Veiller's final screen credit. Veiller died on 27, June 1965 of cancer in Hollywood, California, four days after his 62nd birthday. He was buried in the St Mary Churchyard, Bepton, Chichester, West Sussex, England as was his mother.Accustomed to her Face Filmography * The Witching Hour (1934) - screenplay, producer * Menace (1934) - screenplay * The Notorious Sophie Lang (1934) - screenplay * Break of Hearts (1935) - screenplay * Star of Midnight (1935) - screenplay *College Scandal (1935) - uncredited writer * Jalna (1935) - screenplay * Seven Keys to Baldpate (1935) - screenplay * The Lady Consents (1936) - screenplay * The Ex-Mrs. Bradford (1936) - screenplay * Swing Time (1936) - uncredited writer * A Woman Rebels (1936) - screenplay * Winterset (1936) - screenplay * The Soldier and the Lady (1937) - screenplay * Stage Door (1937) - screenplay * Radio City Revels (1938) - screenplay *The Saint in New York (1938) - screenplay * Gunga Din (1939) - uncredited writer * Let Us Live (1939) - screenplay * Disputed Passage (1939) - screenplay * Typhoon (1940) - producer *Safari (1940) - producer *The Quarterback (1940) - producer *Moon Over Burma (1940) - producer *Victory (1940) - producer *New York Town (1941) - producer * Her Cardboard Lover (1942) - screenplay * Why We Fight: Prelude to War (1942) (documentary) - uncredited writer * Why We Fight: The Battle of Russia (1943) (documentary) - uncredited writer, narrator * Why We Fight: The Nazis Strike (1943) (documentary) - uncredited writer, narrator * Why We Fight: The Battle of Britain (1943) (documentary) - uncredited director, narrator * Assignment in Brittany (1943) - screenplay *Know Your Ally: Britain (1944) (documentary) - uncredited director * Tunisian Victory (documentary) (1944) - uncredited writer * Adventure (1945) - screenplay * War Comes to America (1945) (documentary) - uncredited writer * Two Down and One to Go (1945) (documentary) - screenplay * Here is Germany (1945) (documentary) - uncredited writer, narrator * The Stranger (1946) - screenplay * The Killers (1946) - screenplay * State of the Union (1948) - screenplay, associate producer *Colorado Territory (1949) - producer *Backfire (1950) - producer *Chain Lightning (1950) - producer *Dallas (1950) - producer *Along the Great Divide (1951) - producer *Fort Worth (1951) - producer *Force of Arms (1951) - producer *Red Planet Mars (1952) - screenplay, producer * Moulin Rouge (1952) - screenplay * Beat the Devil (1953) - uncredited writer * That Lady (1955) - screenplay * Safari (1956) - screenplay * Monkey on My Back (1957) - screenplay *The Adventures of Tugboat Annie (1958) (TV series) - executive producer * Solomon and Sheba (1959) - screenplay * Timbuktu (1959) - screenplay *Markham (1960) (TV series) writer of episodes * The List of Adrian Messenger (1963) - screenplay * The Night of the Iguana (1964) - screenplay References External links * American male screenwriters 1903 births 1965 deaths 20th-century American male writers 20th-century American screenwriters ","title":"Anthony Veiller"},{"id":"31194269","text":"Ktzi'ot Prison Ktzi'ot Prison is an Israeli detention facility located in the Negev desert 45 miles south-west of Beersheba.

On September 28, 1953 the Israel Defense Forces established a fortified settlement, Ktzi'ot, overlooking the al-Auja junction. Despite housing soldiers in civilian clothes and engaging in little farming activity the Israelis maintained it was a pioneering farm settlement which did not break the Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement relating to the 145 km2 Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) around al-Auja. The remaining members of the 'Azazme tribe, who depended on the well at al-Auja, were attacked and driven across the border into Egypt.Love, Kennett (1969) Suez. The twice-fought war. Longman. .

When questioned in the presence of a UN military observer he said that all the inhabitants of the kibbutz were soldiers: one captain, four NCOs, 65 men soldiers and fifteen women soldiers. They were armed with rifles, sub machine guns, light machine guns, mortars and anti-tank weapons.Burns, Lt Gen E.L.M. Between Arab and Israeli. Harrap, 1962. Page 93.

Cites Los Angeles Times 4/6. Dates al-Haq report as April 4. Conditions in 1991 Members of Human Rights Watch (HRW) visited the camp in August 1990. It was under the command of Colonel Ze'ev Shaltiel and held 6,216 prisoners. The camp was divided into sections. Each section contained two or more tents and was surrounded by ridges of sand and gravel blocking visibility between sections. The tents, each 50 square meters in size, contained 20–30 men each. Prisoners were confined to the tents for most of the day with three daily counts.HRW. Pages 69, 70, 78. In addition, there was a section surrounded by 3-meter walls and divided into subsections covered in steel netting. There was also a building containing four 3x3 meter punishment cells which, at the time of the HRW visit contained 23 prisoners.HRW. Pages 85,86. The HRW report concluded that the camp was \\"in clear violation of the IV Geneva Convention forbidding the transfer of incarcerated persons from occupied territories to the territory of the occupying power.\\" It also found that: * Access between lawyers and their clients was very restricted. Meetings took place in the open across a double fence. No documents were allowed to be exchanged. A maximum of 20 lawyers were allowed daily, each lawyer restricted to meeting 15–20 prisoners. Meetings were limited to 15 minutes.HRW. Page 86. * Prisoners in tents were exposed to extreme weather conditions. * There were no family visits. * Mail was backlogged and heavily censored.

A few weeks before their visit deputy commander, Major Avi Chasa'i, ordered the firing of tear gas into one of the sections after prisoners refused to stop praying outside their tent. Shortly after the camp was opened, on August 16, 1988, two inmates were shot dead in a riot involving 1,000 prisoners. The camp commander at the time, Colonel David Tsemach, fired the shots that killed at least one of the victims. He was cleared of wrongdoing by an army investigation headed by Colonel Mordechai Peled.HRW. Pages 79,81.Journal of Palestine Studies 70 Winter 1989 Volume XVIII, number 2. Page 229. Gives sources Washington Post 8/17 and al-Fajr, Jerusalem, 8/21. At the time of the HRW visit, 3,802 of the prisoners had been sentenced; 1,442 were Gazans under trial or awaiting trial. There were 877 administrative detainees. Gazan prisoners were kept separate from those from their West Bank counterparts.HRW. Pages 64 ,65. Up to the time of the visit, 21 prisoners had been killed by fellow prisoners, accused of being collaborators.HRW. Page 99. The Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem visited Kt'zi'ot prison May 30, 1991 and February 20, 1992. On their first visit there were 6,049 prisoners of whom 710 were administrative detainees; nine months later there were 5,080 prisoners with 250 being administrative detainees.B'tselem, Detained without trial, p 28 The report comments that the first reaction of visitors to the prison is one of shock: its large size, one of the largest prisons in the world, and its makeshift appearance; the loudspeakers broadcasting the Arabic station of \\"Voice of Israel\\"; the smell of fuel oil. Conditions were very much harsher than in other Israeli prisons. The report suggests that this was due to the military's lack of experience and that the camp was regarded as temporary. It was noted that the Commander, Ze'ev Shaltiel, broke judicial rulings and was using solitary confinement as a means of punishing prisoners. Some prisoners were being held in isolation for longer than the two weeks maximum stipulated. The report describes the camp as being divided into 60m x 60m plots patrolled by armed soldiers. The plots contained 2 to 4 tents, each holding 20–26 individuals.B'tselem, Detained without trial, p 35. An Israeli soldier quoted states that there were 12 tents to each 50m x 50m plot. The tents had no furniture except one bed per prisoner. There was no privacy for prisoners. In summer the temperature rose above 40 degrees, in winter it could fall below freezing. The tents flooded when it rained. Each plot had 3 or 4 half-barrels for garbage, which overflowed causing smell and health problems. Mosquitoes abounded. The only medical help was from physicians on reserve duty doing a one-month tour of duty. There were many cases of skin diseases. Other issues raised included: – prisoners forbidden to wear watches. – no radio or TV. – no access to outside physicians. – no laundry. – studying forbidden. – two hours of volleyball were allowed a day, but only for ten prisoners at a time. Up to B'Tselem's 1992 visit 28 prisoners had been killed by their fellow inmates. The report states that \\"conditions in the facility were illegal and inhuman\\" and described the solitary confinement area as \\"human chicken coops.\\" B'Tselem called for the entire camp to be closed down. The 1992 visit was the last time the human rights group was allowed to see inside any Israeli prison.B'Tselem, Detained without trial. Chapter 4. Conditions of detention at Ketziot (Ansar III). The reopened prison According to information gathered by Defence for Children International (DCI), the prison reopened in April 2002. It consisted of four sections made up of four units, with another half section opened in October 2002. Each unit was surrounded by a five-meter wall and contained three tents. The tents were designed for under twenty men but usually contained more. Each unit had three toilets and was issued with 1 liter of chlorine every 20 days. According to DCI, the main problems were: * Lack of family visits * Overcrowding * Poor food * No supplied clothing * Attacks and theft by guards * No medical care * Exposed to harsh weather * No child- specific procedures for those aged 16 and 17 * No educational material * Rodents The prison, up to 2003, contained around 1,000 prisoners, mostly administrative detainees and including 30–60 boys under 18 years.Cook. Pages 87, 90, 91. The ICRC visited \\"Qetziot military detention camp\\" twice in 2005, and twice in 2006. Ktzi'ot prison is currently run by the Israel Prison Service. Its security systems were installed by G4S Israel (Hashmira). In 2010 plans were put forward to construct a large detention center at Ktzi'ot for illegal immigrants. The border between Israel and Egypt has been used as a crossing point for economic migrants and asylum seekers; it is estimated that two-thirds come from Eritrea and one third from Sudan.John Gee, Washington Report on Middle East Affairs.

Zoich (Cyrillic: Зойч, ) was a proposed mascot for the XXII Winter Olympics, which took first place in the official online poll to select a mascot for the 2014 Sochi games. Despite being a popular Internet character, the committee chose not to introduce it to the final round of the voting. Upon introduction and until the end of the online voting, it was the most popular mascot from those submitted. It also took only about 40 minutes for Zoich to take the top spot. Background September 1, 2010: The Organizing Committee of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic and Paralymplic Games in conjunction with the newspaper Izvestia announces a competition to select the mascots for the 2014 games open to anyone wishing to enter. The competition receives 24,048 entries from across Russia and Russians abroad. September 10, 2010: Moscow artist and designer Yegor Zhgun enters an original sketch of an imaginary frog, naming it \\"Zoich\\". According to its author, the idea of Zoich was indeed influenced by Hypnotoad from Futurama. Description of the mascot Zoich is a fuzzy blue frog. The Olympic Rings rotate in its eyes, taking the role of pupils: black, yellow, and blue in the right eye and red and green in the left. In its mouth, the frog holds a ski pole and a Russian Imperial Crown sits atop its head. The mascot takes its name from the year \\"2014\\" as it is represented on the Olympiad's logo: The numbers 2, 0, and 1 as they are represented look like the Latin Z, O, and I. The number 4 looks like the Russian letter Ч, which is like the English \\"ch\\". Олимпийский талисман Сочи-2014 Many Russian-speaking people read \\"2014\\" as \\"Zoich\\" upon presentation of Sochi-2014 logo. Zhgun's description of his mascot: \\"The Olympic Rings in his eyes spell the progress of Olympic ideals; the tsars’ crown on his head recalls authority and faith.\\" Subsequent event The original idea behind the mascot found large support among visitors to the official voting site, and Zoich reached the top spot in the voting in roughly 40 minutes, where he stayed through the conclusion of the voting. After Zhgun posted an animated clip (which took about two months of development) of his mascot on YouTube on November 8, 2010, finally showing Zoich in motion, the press dubbed the mascot \\"Hypnotoad\\", referencing its obvious resemblance to the character Hypnotoad from American animated TV series Futurama. Информационное агентство «Росбалт» В конкурсе талисманов «Сочи-2014» к последнему дню приема работ лидирует «гипножаба» In July 2011, Futurama referenced the influence of the Hypnotoad on Zoich; the opening sequence of the episode \\"All the Presidents' Heads\\", the 20th episode of the show's sixth season, shows a brief clip from Zhgun's original Zoich animated clip mounted on a television screen.

Spirits Burning is overseen by American composer/producer Don Falcone. History In 1996, Falcone resurrected Spirits Burning. Spirits Burning was one of his first San Francisco bands, for which Falcone played bass and keyboards. Their first recording for a CD was a cover of the King Crimson song Red, on the tribute album “Schizoid Dimension,” released in 1997.Spirits Burning :nl:Spirits Burning, Dutch Wikipedia Spirits Burning signed with French label Musea Records in 1998 and the group released their first album New Worlds By Design on Musea affiliate Gazul Records. Falcone set Spirits Burning on their continuing mission just as the internet began to open up an index of collaborative possibilities that studio recordings and logistics previously precluded: the chance for content-creators to recruit musicians on an ad hoc basis across the ether; musicians they’d have scant hope of playing with face- to-face. In the space rock community, Falcone has done particularly well out of this approach. A survey of his first 10 years under the Spirits Burning banner throws up some surprising contributors (including Daevid Allen, Porcupine Tree’s Steven Wilson, and High Tide’s Simon House).Ian Abrahams, , Record Collector In 2017, Spirits Burning performed live twice in England. The line-up was Steve Bemand, Richard Chadwick, Kev Ellis, Don Falcone, Colin Kafka, Martin Plumley, and Bridget Wishart. Notable Collaborations Falcone, Albert Bouchard (formerly of Blue Öyster Cult), and writer Michael Moorcock have collaborated in Spirits Burning (under the name Spirits Burning & Michael Moorcock). This collaboration was a musical adaptation of Moorcock's An Alien Heat. Michael Moorcock also appeared on five tracks on the Spirits Burning CD Alien Injection, released in 2008. He is credited with singing lead vocals and playing guitar and mandolin. The performances used on the CD were from The Entropy Tango & Gloriana Demo Sessions.Alien Injection, :nl:Alien Injection, Dutch Wikipedia Falcone and Bridget Wishart (formerly of Hawkwind) have collaborated in Spirits Burning (including releases under the name Spirits Burning & Bridget Wishart). Falcone and Cyrille Verdeaux of Clearlight have collaborated in Spirits Burning (including releases under the name Spirits Burning & Clearlight). Falcone and Daevid Allen (of Gong) have collaborated in Spirits Burning (including a single released under the name Spirits Burning & Daevid Allen). Robert Calvert's Centigrade 232 tape recitation was first used with music on the second Spirits Burning album Reflections In A Radio Shower, released in 2001. Don Falcone took the original recording of Calvert reading his poem Centigrade 232 and integrated it into the track Drive-By Poetry.Knut Gerwers – Calvert Collaborations Lines from another Centigrade 232 poem (\\"Ode To A Crystal Set\\") appear on the CD's opening track Second Degree Soul Sparks.

Early life Alden was born in Troy, New York in 1884, one of eight children, only four of whom survived. His family's summer holidays were spent on the Sakonnet in Rhode Island and on the Narragansett Bay, where he first learned about boats. He sailed his sister's flat-bottomed rowing boat using an umbrella as a sail and was said to be inspired by the local fisherman and regattas. At 18 years old, his father died, and Alden made the decision to train as a naval architect. He took courses at MIT and apprenticed with prominent naval architects Starling Burgess and Bowdoin B. Crowninshield, starting in 1902. In 1900, his family moved to Dorchester, Massachusetts where the Grand Banks fishing schooners were docked. These were said to have inspired his later designs. A compulsive doodler, as a child he made countless sketches of the boats that were later to make him famous. Career The Puritan, a schooner designed by Alden, being launched in 1931. In the winter of 1907, Alden undertook a voyage that would define his distinctive design trademark: The schooner Fame, owned by the Eastern Fishing company, had to be returned to Boston when her crew of 23 men had gone down with smallpox and there was no one left to sail her. Alden put together a crew of four inexperienced young men and one old salt to undertake the journey. During the weeks that followed, they experienced extreme winter weather of up to 60 mile an hour winds that turned the salt spray to ice. The boat, and the crew, completed the journey and it is said that Alden learned how to design a boat that would be resilient in heavy seas and what was important when a vessel was short-handed. His subsequent designs are admired not only for their grace and elegance but for their stability and for the fact that they can, generally, be sailed single-handedly if necessary. After the voyage, Alden returned to the Burgess offices but left in 1909 to found his own company, the Alden Design Office in 1909. =Alden Design Office= The early years of the Alden Design were difficult and were said to have put a strain on his finances and on his marriage, which broke down after only three years. By 1917, business had improved and the offices were doing sufficiently well that by the 1920s, the office was able to employ specialist draftsmen. The approach Alden took was to discuss requirements with the clients, make the initial sketches and then hand over the work to the draftsmen to complete. Therefore, each boat designed by the firm had Alden's individual style stamped on. By 1932, the Alden Design Office was known around the world due to the success of the \\"Malabar\\" designs in the offshore racing scene: *In 1923, Malabar IV won the Newport–Bermuda race *In 1926, Malabar VII won the Newport–Bermuda race *In 1932, Malabar X won overall, with his other designs occupying the top four places. When Alden achieved his great success in the 1932 Bermuda race, the yachting world was already beginning to see changes in boat design. Olin Stephens' yawl Dorade, which had already won the Transatlantic and Fastnet races in 1931, was the winner in Class B. Stephens followed this with another winner, Stormy Weather which won the 1936 Transatlantic Race to Norway by a wide margin. This began a long-running rivalry between the two designers. Alden's designs depended on a certain amount of inside ballast, where Stephens' adopted the idea of all- outside ballast. Stephens' boats were of lighter construction, using steam bent frames, rather than the sawn frames favored by Alden. Over the next thirty years, Alden designed over 1,000 boats, including the 63.5' schooner \\"When and If\\" for General Patton, though of them all the 744 Rena series have been considered the most admired. Eric Hiscock, a leading yachtsman of the time, said \\"I considered her to be one of the most beautiful yachts I had ever seen, …quite perfect in (her) sea-kindly grace and harmony\\". =Later life= From the 1950s onwards, Alden took an increasingly less active role in the design business and retired in 1955. The Alden Design office carried on until 2008, under the helm of Niels Christian Helleberg, naval architect. Helleberg continued providing design and print services until closing his office in January 2014.Hart Nautical Collections List mitmuseum.mit.edu, accessed 6 March 2019 Alden continued to race into his seventies, and enjoyed sailing one of his Sakonnet One designs until his death in Florida at the age of 78.

Based on the children's book of the same name by Wilson Rawls and a loose remake of the 1974 film of the same name, it follows the story of Billy Colman who buys and trains two Redbone Coonhound hunting dogs to hunt raccoons in the Ozark mountains. A redbone coonhound Plot An older Billy Coleman rescues a beagle from attack by another neighborhood dog. He takes it home with him so that its wounds can heal. In light of this event, he has a flashback to when he was a ten-year-old boy living in the Ozark mountains. Growing up in the Ozarks with his parents and two younger sisters, Billy wants to own a pair of hunting dogs but his parents tell him that they can't afford them. He tries going to his grandfather when he learns that he's selling a Bluetick coonhound outside his store, but his rivals, the Pritchards, beat him to it. After they leave, Billy tells his grandfather that he believes that God doesn't want him to have any dogs. His grandfather replies that maybe it's because Billy's not doing his fair share of the deal, and if he wants His help, he has to meet Him half ways. At first, he doesn't understand what that means, but after coming across an article in a sportsman magazine offering a pair of Redbone coonhounds in Kentucky for $25 each, he finally understands what his grandfather meant and decides to earn the money himself. For two years, he works many different jobs, and manages to save $50. When he reveals the money to his grandfather and tells him he understood what he meant, his grandfather is amazed by Billy's hard work. When he asks if he ever told his father, he reveals that he never knew, believing that his father would use the money to get a new mule, which is something he is in deep need of, if he ever knew about the money. Inspired by Billy's hard work, his grandfather guarantees that Billy will get his hounds. For many days, Billy desperately awaits for the day to come that his dogs would eventually come. When his father tells Billy that his grandfather has something for him, Billy immediately runs off to his grandfather's store, only to discover that the dogs were delivered to Tahlequah, not to his store. Billy is discouraged, but his grandfather tells him to not worry, that he can get a ride in a week from that day. He also gives Billy his change of $10, telling him that prices are going down on everything due to the depression. However, Billy is convinced that his pups won't last that long, and sneaks out the following night to walk down to Tahlequah himself to get his dogs. After many hours, he finally reaches Tahlequah by daylight, and gets his dogs. However, a group of classist boys start ganging up on Billy. When one of them start abusing one of his dogs by pulling on its ear, Billy warns him to stay away. However, the boy challenges him to a fight, which results in a fallout between Billy and the boys. Suddenly, the sheriff shows up and breaks up the fight, and orders the boys to leave. He tends to the beat up Billy, and compliments his dogs. He is amazed by how Billy got his dogs, and he befriends him. With $10 left over, he decides to go shopping for his family; his father a pair of new overalls, his mother some sewing cloth to make dresses, and some candy for his two little sisters. Before he leaves, the Sheriff buys Billy a soda, something he's never had before. Finally, Billy begins his trip home. During the night, he senses something coming in the bushes. Hidden, he briefly sees the face of a mountain lion, but before it can come out and attack, Billy grabs a branch, lights it on fire, and uses it to scare it away. The next morning, Billy sees a heart carved in a tree that says \\"Dan Loves Ann\\" in it, and decides to name his dogs Old Dan and Little Ann. Cast *Joseph Ashton as Billy Coleman *Dave Matthews as Will Coleman *Renee Faia as Jenny Coleman *Mac Davis as Hod Bellington *Kris Kristofferson as Older Billy Coleman *Ned Beatty as Sheriff Abe McConnell *Dabney Coleman as Grandpa Differences between the film and the book While the book and 1974 film version depict Billy Coleman to have long blond hair, the Billy Coleman in the 2003 film has short, dark brown hair. The novel depicted the coon hunting competition to last about six nights, whereas the two film versions place it at four nights. In the novel and 1974 film version, Billy Coleman, his dogs, and the two Pritchard boys Rainie and Rubin hunt for the legendary ghost coon at night, but in the 2003 film, they hunt for the ghost coon at daylight. Also, the 2003 film placed the boys' betted money at five dollars, while the 1974 film and novel, place the money at two dollars. In the 2003 film, when Billy and his hounds encounter the mountain lion, Billy and Little Ann chase away the lion after it fatally injured Old Dan. In the novel and 1974 film version, Billy kills the mountain lion with his axe to save Old Dan. Old Dan's death is much more graphic and gory in the book, which involved his intestines being torn out, trying to fix him back up, and dying the next day. In the 2003 film, we just see Old Dan struggle to get up and we only see a giant gash in his hip. Billy pets him and tells him it's going to be alright, but the scene transitions to the next day where it is revealed Old Dan didn't survive when it is seen that he is being buried. Before Billy gets his dogs, he learns his grandpa is selling a Bluetick coonhound. He goes to see him, however, the Pritchards buy him before he can, just to be mean to Billy. This scene never happens in the book but was introduced by the 1974 film. Rubin's death is much more violent, graphic and prolonged in the book. In the movie, we only see him trip facedown, hear him let out a terrible scream. As Rainie runs off to get his father, Billy runs over to him and flips him over, and looks in horror as he sees the axe sticking out of Rubin's body. In this film, when Billy finds the ghost coon, he admits to the Pritchard boys that they were right and he was wrong. In the novel and 1974 film version, he tells them that he has in fact found the ghost coon and the boys attempt to cheat him by having him kill the coon before he can get his money; which was never part of the deal, that Billy and his dogs would simply tree him and find him, which results in a violent fallout between the boys. The 2003 Walt Disney produced version also avoids depicting the death of both dogs, Old Dan & Little Ann, by ending the film before that eventuality (which happens in the book and the 1974 film version doesn't shy away from), which somewhat lessens its overall emotional impact.

However, the court endorsed the holding in Turner that preserving \\"free\\" broadcast television constituted a content- neutral measure that imposes only incidental burdens on speech sufficient to pass muster using intermediate First Amendment scrutiny. The court held that imposing mandatory carriage requirements on satellite television operators furthers an important, narrowly drawn governmental interest: #preserving a multiplicity of local broadcast outlets; and #preventing the grant of a compulsory copyright license from undermining broadcast television competition, an outcome that could occur should DBS operators deprive their customers access to non-network broadcast stations.Rob Frieden, Analog and Digital Must-Carry Obligations of Cable and Satellite Television Operators in the United States, Pennsylvania State University =Congress Options= *It could have decided to give satellite carriers a station-by-station copyright license that could be used free of carriage obligations(4th Cir. 2001) *The other choice was to impose the carry one, carry all rule in order to create a market-by-market copyright license(4th Cir. 2001) The Supreme Court has said that the \\"principal inquiry in determining content neutrality...is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of [agreement or] disagreement with the message it conveys\\". This inquiry involves two steps.Stuart Minor Benjamin, professor, Duke University School of Law, Telecommunication Laws and Policy, Oct, 2006 *First: we must examine the plain terms of the regulation to see whether, on its face, the regulation confers benefits or imposes burdens based upon the content of the speech it regulates. if it does not, we then ask whether the regulation's manifest purpose is to regulate speech because of the message it conveys. : > Each satellite carrier providing, under section 122 title 17, secondary > transmissions to subscribers located within the local market of a television > broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that station shall carry > upon request the signals of all television broadcast stations located with > in that local market.Reardon, Marguerite. \\"Verizon CEO slams Net > neutrality\\". http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-10379932-266.html.

SHVIA's carriageInternational telecommunication union, John wily, Sept,10,2002 obligations are not triggered simply by the decision to carry a local broadcast station in a given market. instead, they are triggered by the decision to carry that station by making use of the 122 license. A satellite carrier that privately negotiates the required copyright clearances can retransmit the signal of a local broadcast station without incurring any carriage obligations, but a carrier that retransmits the same signal by means of the statutory copyright license must comply with the carry one, carry all rule.Philip J. Weiser, University of Colorado, Telecommunication, Oct,2002 thus, the burdens of the rule do not depend on a satellite carrier's choice of content, but on its decision to transmit that content by using one set of economic arrangements rather that another. Accordingly, we hold that the carry one, carry all rule is content neutral on its faceJames B.

The satellite carriers claim that the rule has a content-based purpose because it seeks to promote the survival of independent broadcast stations, including affiliates of emerging networks, commercial independent stations, and public broadcasting stations. in support of this claim they cite language from the Conference Report indicating that Congress was concerned that satellite carriers would choose to carry only affiliates of the major networks and that other local broadcasterslocal broadcasters Cable television fact sheet, Cable Carriage of Broadcast Stations would be cut off from portions of their potential viewing audiences. in addition, the satellite carriers rely on legislative history suggesting that Congress sought to protect local broadcast stations because those station s provide valuable news and public affairs programming to their communities.Howard A.

Feb 13, 2002 UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT =The proposed legislation violates federal law= Additionally, this 10-day notice period runs afoul of federal law as it is a restriction that unreasonably delays or prevents installation, maintenance or use of satellite services. The FCC derived its authority to create the OTARD Rule via the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (\\"1996 Act\\"). In Section 207 of the 1996 Act, Congress directed the FCC to \\"promulgate regulations to prohibit restrictions that impair a viewer's ability to receive video programming services through devices designed for over-the-air reception of television broadcast signals, multichannel multipoint distribution service, or digital broadcast satellite services.\\" Testimony of Lisa V. McCabe Director, Public Policy and Outreach, Feb 17, 2009 Implementation =Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization ActSatellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act [section] 110 report: a report of the Register of Copyrights, February 2006 / U.S. Copyright Office.=  Historical Introduction  Three statutory licenses in the Copyright Act (\\"Act\\") govern the retransmission of distant and local over-the-air broadcast station signals. There is one statutory license applicable to cable television systems and two statutory licenses applicable to satellite carriers.which are license 111, license 109, and license 120United States. Congress. House. Committee on the Judiciary, Satellite Home Viewer Extension and  Then and Now  *Recent changes in the video programming marketplace and in video distribution technology are shaking the foundations of the communications industry and the law. The Internet, digital television, and video services using Internet Protocol, have changed the way individuals receive and consume all types of media. Traditional cable and satellite services are losing subscribers and market share to these newer technologies. There is also less interest in programming retransmitted over distant broadcast signals as a result of these new platforms and systems. These fundamental shifts call into question the appropriateness of the current statutory licensing systems in the Act.Federal Communications Commission, FCC ISSUES NOTICE REGARDING MEASUREMENT STANDARDS FOR DIGITAL TELEVISION SIGNALS PURSUANT TO SATELLITE HOME VIEWER EXTENSION AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2004, US Fed News Service, Including US State News, 2006 *Broadcast television stations are changing the scope and breadth of their services, too. Digital television technology allows broadcasters to provide more programming choices to over-the-air viewers as well as to cable and satellite subscribers. Digital television stations now provide a mix of high definition and standard definition broadcast signals and may possibly offer interactive television services in the future. More importantly, such stations are able to \\"multicast\\" by splitting their digital signals into smaller streams each of which may be independently programmed. It is axiomatic that the digital television transmissions are much different than traditional analog transmissions. For that reason, the existing distant signal licenses, whose foundations were built upon analog broadcast technology, cannot readily accommodate the vibrant capabilities of digital television. =Extended Signal Importation Opportunities= SHVERA provides DBS operators with better opportunities to import distant broadcast signals into markets lacking \\"local-into-local\\" delivery of nearby signals and localities unserviced by terrestrial broadcast network signals. local-into-local means that if a satellite customer lives in an area where the satellite company has decided to provide the service, the customer can receive local TV channels. If the company decides that it will not provide local broadcast stations in an area, the consumer may still receive local broadcast stations by using an antenna or basic cable service. =Retransmission of Distant Digital Network Signals= SHVERA also offers DBS operators the opportunity to deliver distant digital network signals into \\"digital white areas\\" where the nearest network broadcaster does not currently offer digital content, or where adequate off- air reception does not occur. Summary The satellite and cable regulatory frameworks attempt to balance a number of longstanding, but potentially conflicting, public policy goals—most notably, localised, competitive provision of video services, support for the creative process, and preservation of free over-the-air broadcast television.Charles B. Goldfarb, Reauthorizing the Satellite Home Viewing Provisions in the Communications Act and the Copyright Act: Issues for Congress, Specialist in Telecommunications Policy February 2, 2010 They also attempt to balance the interests of the satellite, cable, broadcast, and program content industries. Congress incorporated the sunset provisions in SHVERA Charles B. Goldfarb, SHRDDNS Report because of its concern that market changes could affect these balances. The statutory provisions distinguish between the retransmission of local signals—the broadcast signals of stations located in the same local market as the subscriber—and of distant signals. Provisions block or restrict the retransmission of many distant broadcast signals in order to protect local broadcasters from competition from distant signals and to provide them with a stronger negotiating position vis-à-vis the satellite and cable operators, with the intention of fostering local programming. But the regulatory framework also recognizes that U.S. households benefit from the receipt of certain distant broadcast signals and includes explicit retransmission and copyright rules for these. Ruling =Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 at 106th Congress First Session, in the state of united states, Nov 17th, 1999= This Act modified the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988. SHVIA permits satellite broadcasters to provide local broadcast TV signals to all their subscribers in that local TV station's market. SHVIA also permits satellite broadcasters (satellite broadcasters. 2000-2001) to provide \\"distant\\" or national broadcast programming to subscribers. SHIVA Fact Sheet information sheet, Oct, 2006 > Famous Quote The Act also imposes a \\"carry one, carry all\\" rule, which was > designed to \\"preserve free television for those not served by satellite or > cable and to promote widespread dissemination of information from a > multiplicity of sources.\\" Carry one.carry allTed Hearn, Plan Allows Satellite Giants To Down Convert HD Signals For Years, Multichannel News, 3/19/2008 The National Association of Broadcasters, which did not return requests for comment, is probably going to be unhappy because the FCC plans to allow DirecTV and Dish to down convert broadcasters' HD signals to a less pristine picture resolution for several years. The satellite giants-which combined serve about 30 million pay-TV subscribers-convinced FCC officials that they lacked the channel capacity to provide every eligible station in HD immediately. They insisted that they needed several years to prepare for a full HD carriage requirement. HD signals stress capacity because they take up much more bandwidth than digital signal transmitted at lower resolution. The FCC's HD rules for satellite were far more lenient than the ones originally proposed by FCC chairman Kevin Martin. He started off at full HD carriage in February 2009, coupled with a market-by- market waiver process. Martin scuttled his original plan after DirecTV and Dish Network complained that it was draconian and damaging to their ability to compete with cable. Instead, the FCC decided to give DirecTV and EchoStar until 2013 to carry all stations in HD within any market where they have elected to carry any station's signal in HD format. The \\"carry one, carry all in HD\\" principle kicks in when a satellite company starts carrying local signals in HD. DirecTV's decision to carry local TV signals in HD does not force Dish to do likewise in the same market. =Circuit JudgeD.C Court Appeals Ruling, United States Appeals Court, For the District of Columbia, Argued March 5, 2001= Rogers, Circuit Judge: Following enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Federal Communications Commission promulgated a rule prohibiting restrictions on certain over-the-air reception devices (\\"OTARD\\")., FCC Satellite and Antenna Regulations-the OTARD Rule, Oct, 2003 The rule invalidated > [a]ny restriction, including but not limited to any state or local law or > regulation, including zoning, land-use or building regulation, or any > private covenant, homeowners' association rule or similar restriction on > property within the exclusive use or control of the antenna user where the > user has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the property that > impairs the installation, maintenance, or use of [antennas that are designed > to receive direct broadcast satellite service, video programming services > via multipoint distribution services, or television broadcast signals]...

Located centrally on the campus of Arizona State University, ACMRS is charged with coordinating and stimulating interdisciplinary research about medieval and early modern literature and culture. Its mission is to enable and promote the most expansive, creative, and daring scholarship in medieval and renaissance studies. ACMRS fosters a vibrant intellectual community for the faculty at the three universities, but also by publishes forward-looking, vanguard research through their in-house press. ACMRS promotes work that is historically grounded and theoretically expansive, with the aim of advancing dialogues that reach into the present moment and point us to different, more inclusive, futures. Moreover, ACMRS develops projects that explore complex topics in an accessible manner so as to reach as wide an audience as possible. In keeping with the ASU charter, ACMRS believes that success in realizing this vision for premodern scholarship should be judged not by whom we exclude, but whom we include, and how they succeed.  History of ACMRS  = Directors = From 1982 until 1994, ACMRS was directed by Jean R. Brink from the Department of English at ASU. Robert E. Bjork, also from the Department of English at ASU, directed the center from 1994 to 2018. Starting in 2018, ACMRS is directed by Ayanna Thompson, Professor in the Department of English at Arizona State University.  Public Programs  = Distinguished Lectures = In the spring of 1999, ACMRS established its Distinguished Lecture Series. Initially, the Center brought one eminent scholar to ASU for a few days to present a public lecture, interact with upper-division and/or graduate classes, and meet informally with students and faculty. The Distinguished Lecture series was reimagined in 2018 to support the mission of developing public-facing humanities programs that make premodern studies relevant to a contemporary, non-academic audience. In January of 2018, ACMRS hosted Peter Sellars for an evening dialogue entitled \\"Engaging the Past to Create the Avant Garde.\\" In January of 2019, ACMRS will be hosting Marlon James as the annual distinguished lecturer, for an event entitled \\"Reclaiming the Fantasy Novel.\\" In October of 2020, ACMRS will host Nnedi Okorafor as the Distinguished Lecturer for the 2020-21 academic year. = RaceB4Race = RaceB4Race is an ongoing conference series and professional network community by and for scholars of color working on issues of race in premodern literature, history and culture. RaceB4Race centers the expertise, perspectives, and sociopolitical interests of BIPOC scholars, whose work seeks to expand critical race theory. Bridging many traditional disciplinary divides, RaceB4Race not only creates innovative scholarly dialogues, but also fosters social change within premodern studies as a whole. The inaugural RaceB4Race conference emerged as a collaboration between the Medievalists of Color (MOC) and the ShakeRace (Shakespeare and Race) community, groups that were both seeking to push their fields in new archival, theoretical, methodological, pedagogical and practical directions. The catalyst for the event was the rejection of proposals for sessions on race and antiracism by Medievalists of Color in favor of sessions proposed by their white colleagues by the International Congress of Medieval Studies (ICMS) in Kalamazoo, MI. RaceB4Race offered an “alternate home” for the rejected MOC sessions and a much-needed opportunity for a collaboration between the MOC and ShakeRace communities. In the end, the inaugural RaceB4Race event demonstrated to the world how our understandings of periodization, historicity and even academic disciplines can become more expansive once race is acknowledged as a viable lens of investigation.  Awards and Fellowships  = ACMRS-Huntington Library Fellowship = The Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, in collaboration with The Huntington Library, offers annually the ACMRS Huntington Library Fellowship to aid in dissertation, post-doctoral or faculty research using the collections of The Huntington. A requirement for holding the fellowship is that the time of tenure be spent in residence at The Huntington: the period of residence may vary, but must be a minimum of one month. The Huntington Library welcomes the inaugural ACMRS fellow with a $3,500 award for a one-month residency. = Graduate Travel Award = ACMRS offers a travel award to a graduate student to present a paper at the International Medieval Congress, held every May at the Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo. = Ira Aldridge Internships = The Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies offers paid internships for ASU undergraduates. Interns earn hands-on experience in publishing, working directly with ACMRS staff and scholars on projects that will have a direct influence on the Center. Interns are paid $2,800 and can receive 3 credit hours. = Short Term Residencies = The annual ACMRS Short-Term Residency will enable scholars who have earned a Ph.D. in a pre-modern field to pursue their research for a period of four to six weeks. The residency is designed to allow scholars to focus on finishing projects for publication. The Director of ACMRS and senior members of ACMRS’ in-house press can provide publishing advice and mentoring. Each resident will present their work in a public lecture, showcasing their scholarship. Opportunities for graduate student mentorship are also available.  Publications  = Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies (MRTS) and Renaissance English Text Society (RETS) = Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies (MRTS) is a series of translations, studies, reference works, and editions including those of the Renaissance English Text Society (RETS). MRTS Online is a joint project between Iter and ACMRS to make select MRTS titles available in electronic format. = Anglo- Saxon Manuscripts in Microfiche Facsimile (ASMMF) = Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts in Microfiche Facsimile (ASMMF) is a project which makes available in microfiche nearly five hundred manuscripts containing Old English. = Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History = Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History is a journal that provides an outlet for the presentation of scholarship that often falls outside the limitations of other publications. It publishes interpretive and historiographical essays that explore the ramifications of current scholarship or that treat issues and themes of interest to any historian of the pre-modern period. = Early Modern Women = Early Modern Women: An Interdisciplinary Journal is a joint publication of ACMRS and the University of Maryland. This journal publishes essays on women and gender during the years 1500-1700 from all geographical areas and across all relevant fields: European, African, Islamic, Asian, and colonial studies, as well as studies of literature, art, music, history, history of science, religion, and anthropology.  Fundraising and Endowment  = The Saint John's Bible = In October 2010, ACMRS unveiled the Heritage Edition of the St. John's Bible at its annual Distinguished Lecture in Medieval Studies. Dr. Rodney M. Thompson, Honorary Research Fellow at the School of History and Classics of the University of Tasmania, presented a lecture on the \\"Great Illuminated Bibles of 12th-Century England: A Study in Splendor\\" following the dedication of the specially-printed facsimile Bible. The seven-volume Heritage Edition was donated by Phoenix resident, George Berkner, a 1956 Saint John's University graduate. It resides at the Universities' Special Collections in Hayden Library at ASU and in the offices of ACMRS. = The Seated King = In the Spring of 2004, ACMRS received a unique medieval statue as a donation from the Metropolitan Museum of Art docent, Jeri Garbaccio and her husband Charles. The gift was accepted in honor of Florence E. Nelson of Scottsdale, Arizona, and in memory of Renee Kra, former Managing Editor of Radiocarbon at the University of Arizona. The medieval figure is a three-foot wood polychromy seated king of Spanish origin, dating back to the second half of the thirteenth century. The statue is on display at the ACMRS main office in Tempe, Arizona.

It depicts four figures on a balcony, one of whom is sitting; the painter Berthe Morisot, who married Manet's brother Eugène in 1874. In the centre is the painter Jean Baptiste Antoine Guillemet. On the right is Fanny Claus, a violinist. The fourth figure, partially obscured in the interior's background, is possibly Léon Leenhoff, Manet's son. It was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1869, and then kept by Manet until his death in 1883. It was sold to the painter Gustave Caillebotte in 1884, who left it to the French state in 1894. It is currently held at the Musée d'Orsay, in Paris. Inspiration and description The painting, inspired by Majas on the Balcony by Francisco Goya, was created at the same time and with the same purpose as Luncheon in the Studio. The three characters, who were all friends of Manet, seem to be disconnected from each other: while Berthe Morisot, on the left, looks like a romantic and inaccessible heroine, the young violinist Fanny Claus and the painter Antoine Guillemet seem to display indifference. The boy in the background is probably Manet's son, Léon. Just behind the railings, there are a hydrangea in a ceramic pot, and a dog with a ball below Morisot's chair. This was the first portrait of Morisot by Manet. Manet adopts a restrained colour palette, dominated by white, green and black, with accents of blue (Guillemet's tie) and red (Morisot's fan). Manet made many preparatory studies, painting the four subjects individually many times: Guillemet as many as fifteen times. A preparatory study for The Balcony was painted at Boulogne in 1868. This unfinished portrait of Fanny Claus, the closest friend of Manet’s wife Suzanne Leenhoff; Claus married Manet's friend Pierre Prins in 1869. The work was bought after Manet's death in a studio sale by John Singer Sargent. The portrait had only been seen once in public since it was first painted in 1868, but in 2012 the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford succeeded in raising the funds to acquire it and keep it permanently in a public collection in the United Kingdom.Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus by Edouard Manet, Art Fund Reception The painting was not well received when it was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1869. The aggressive and bold green of the balcony rails drew much attention, as evidenced by the article devoted to the work by the in 1878 which stated:Tome XVI, p. 281. \\"This painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1869 and is one of those who contributed to form this reputation for eccentricity realistic, this reputation of bad taste that was attached to Mr. Manet.\\" The press considered the painting as \\"discordant\\". The contrast of colours (the background completely black, the white faces and clothes, the blue tie of the man, and the green railings) contributes to create an atmosphere of \\"mystery\\". Manet deliberately eschewed any sense of connection between the figures, treating them more like objects in a still life than living people. None of them looks at the others. One commentator, the caricaturist Cham, sarcastically called for the shutters to be closed. Morisot herself said \\" (\\"I look more peculiar than ugly; it seems that people asking about it have used the words femme fatale to describe me.\\"). Albert Wolff described it as \\"coarse art\\"\\" at \\"the level of house painters\\". Manet kept the painting until his death in 1883, hanging it near his painting of Olympia. It was bought from the sale of Manet's estate in February 1884 by Gustave Caillebotte, who paid 3,000 francs. Caillebotte displayed it in a prominent position in his house at Gennevilliers. On his death in 1894, Caillebotte's will left the painting, with other works, to the French state. It was displayed at the from 1896 to 1929, then at the until 1986 (from 1947, at the ). It was transferred to the in 1986. Surrealist René Magritte painted Perspective II: Manet's Balcony in 1950, a commentary on the present work. On the balcony are four coffins (one \\"seated\\") in place of the four people. Michel Foucault said of Magritte's painting, \\"\\" (It is this limit of life and death, of light and darkness, which is there, manifested by these three characters).Quoted in Sheaffer-Jones, Caroline. \\"Georges Bataille's Manet and the 'Strange Impression of an Absence'.\\" Framing French Culture, edited by Natalie Edwards et al., University of Adelaide Press, South Australia, 2015, p. 236. Magritte told Foucault, \\"For me the setting of The Balcony offered a suitable place to put coffins. The 'mechanism' at work here might form the object of a learned explanation, which I am unable to provide.

Critici sacri Under the direction of Gouldman, John Pearson and Anthony Scattergood, the nine-volume Critici Sacri was published in London in 1660 with a dedication to Charles II. Intended as a companion to the Polyglott Bible of Brian Walton (1657), Critici sacri was a collection of essays on Biblical interpretation, antiquities, textual criticism and exegesis by the most significant theologians of the time.Donald K. McKim, Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters (InterVarsity Press, 2007), p. 33. At the beginning of the 19th century, the theologian Adam Clarke considered Critici sacri the most important collection of Biblical criticism ever made,Adam Clarke, general preface to The Holy Bible (New York, 1811), p. xiii. and in the 21st century it is still recognized as a great work.McKim, Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters, p. 33.

Biography Friedrich von Hermann was born on 5 December 1795, at Dinkelsbühl in Bavaria. After finishing his primary education he was for some time employed in a draughtsman's office. He then resumed his studies, partly at the gymnasium in his native town, partly at the universities of Erlangen and Würzburg. In 1817 he began working for a private school at Nuremberg, where he remained for four years. After filling an appointment as teacher of mathematics at the gymnasium of Erlangen, he became in 1823 Privatdozent at the university in that town. His inaugural dissertation was on the notions of political economy among the Romans (Dissertatio exhibens sententias Romanorum ad oeconomiam politicam pertinentes, Erlangen, 1823). He afterwards acted as professor of mathematics at the gymnasium and polytechnic school in Nuremberg, where he continued till 1827. During his stay there he published an elementary treatise on arithmetic and algebra (Lehrbuch der Arith. u. Algeb., 1826), and made a journey to France to inspect the organization and conduct of technical schools in that country. The results of his investigation were published in 1826 and 1828 (Über technische Unterrichts-Anstalten). Soon after his return from France, he was made professor extraordinarius of political science of the university of Munich, and in 1833 he was advanced to the rank of ordinary professor. In 1832 appeared the first edition of his great work on political economy, Staatswirthschaftliche Untersuchungen (“Investigations in Political Economy”). In 1835 he was made member of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences. From the year 1836 he acted as inspector of technical instruction in Bavaria, and made frequent journeys to Berlin and Paris in order to study the methods there pursued. In the state service of Bavaria, to which he devoted himself, he rose rapidly. In 1837 he was placed on the council for superintendence of church and school work; in 1839 he was entrusted with the direction of the bureau of statistics; in 1845 he was one of the councillors for the interior. In 1848 he sat as member for Munich in the national assembly at Frankfort. In this assembly Hermann, with Johann Heckscher and others, was mainly instrumental in organizing the so-called \\"Great German\\" party, and was selected as one of the representatives of their views at Vienna. Warmly supporting the customs union (Zollverein), he acted in 1851 as one of its commissioners at the great industrial exhibition at London, and published an elaborate report on the woollen goods. Three years later he was president of the committee of judges at the similar exhibition at Munich, and the report of its proceedings was drawn up by him. In 1855 he became councillor of state, the highest honour in the service. From 1835 to 1847 he contributed a long series of reviews, mainly of works on economical subjects, to the Münchener gelehrte Anzeigen and also wrote for Rau's Archiv der politischen Ökonomie and the Augsburger allgemeine Zeitung. As head of the bureau of statistics he published a series of valuable annual reports (Beiträge zur Statistik des Königreichs Bayern, Hefte 1-17, 1850–1867). In later years, this work was regarded as distinguishing him as a pioneer in the field of statistics. He was engaged at the time of his death, on 23 November 1868, upon a second edition of his Staatswirthschaftliche Untersuchungen, which was published in 1870. Staatswirthschaftliche Untersuchungen The Staatswirthschaftliche Untersuchungen (“Investigations in Political Economy”; 1832, 2nd ed. 1870), although not a systematic treatise on political economy, has been regarded by some as the most important contribution to political economy since the Wealth of Nations in many aspects. It cannot, indeed, be said to contain principles which are in themselves novel or original; Hermann's merits are not so much those of a discoverer as of a most acute and subtle critic. Like David Ricardo he excels in abstract analysis, in resolution of complex phenomena into their simpler elements, but he has a more firm hold than Ricardo ever seems to have possessed of the true nature of these elementary facts, and a remarkable power of precisely stating and comprehensively combining them. The peculiar value of the Untersuchungen consists in the strict analysis to which the primary notions of economics are subjected, in the general conception of the method and plan of the science which emerges from this analysis, and in the way in which fundamental principles are carried out in the detailed problems of the science. Some thought Hermann's approach allowed the clear rendering of the position of a pure theory of economic facts as an indispensable and independent branch of social science, as opposed to the historic method of inquiry, which was seen as fatal to much that was regarded as distinctive of the abstract or English school of political economy. Hermann's approach, and that of the writers of continental Europe who followed him, was thus seen as harmonizing perfectly with the theory of the elementary facts from which economical development takes its start. At the time of his death, Hermann had recast, enlarged, and amended nearly two-thirds of the second edition of the Untersuchungen. What was finally published by his friends Dr. Helferich and Dr. Mayr also included those parts of the first edition which had not been revised or superseded. There were later several reprints. The second edition of the Untersuchungen consists of ten separate essays, of which the first, on the fundamental notions of economics (“Grundlegung,” pp. 1–77), the fifth (pp. 143–389, on “Production”), the sixth (pp. 390–459, on “Price”), the eighth (pp. 448–531, on “Profit”), and the ninth (pp. 582–598,on “Revenue”) are of the greatest importance. In the “Grundlegung,” a clear and lucid description is given of the simple phenomena, in family, community, and state, upon which the investigations are founded. Human wants and the satisfaction to be obtained for them by labour exercised on natural agents are recognized as the primitive facts. But in the satisfaction of wants there are two aspects, the technical and the economical. Technically we consider solely the process by which commodities of a quality suited to satisfy want are obtained. Economically we have always to estimate the ratio between the effort expended and the result obtained. An “economy” is a distribution of forces so that the result, satisfaction, may be obtained with least expenditure of effort, with least loss of utility. The influence of this economical principle, the institutions to which it gives rise, the conditions under which it is possible, and the circumstances which affect, modify, or counteract it, are traced with reference to the individual, the family, the community, and the state or nation. The increasing complexity of the phenomena does not alter the nature of the principle which lies at the basis of them, and it is the business of economic theory to analyse these phenomena under guidance of the general principle. Economics is therefore defined by Hermann as the “quantitative theory of goods;” and, though he is sparing in the use of symbols, his method of treatment is throughout mathematical. Deserving of attention is the manner in which he points out the influence of collective feeling and collective wants as giving rise to special institutions (government, defence) in the community. To this first fundamental essay the three succeeding papers (“Wants,” “Goods,” “Economy,” pp. 78–142) are appendices. The treatment of these, the classifications given, the detailed discussion of particular points, e.g., the productivity of labour, and the distinction drawn between economical estimates from the individual or the collective point of view, make up a solid contribution to the science. The fifth essay is an elaborate treatise on the theory of production, treating the agents of production free goods, labour, and capital separately, then the interests of the several parties engaged, and the changes due to variations in the cost of producing. Under “Labour” is given the most complete and systematic discussion of separation of employments. Capital is defined so as to include land, but careful reference is made to the distinctive peculiarities of this form of wealth. Especially remarkable is Hermann's treatment of what he calls Nutz- capital (“service capital”), with regard to which he accepts almost entirely the view of J. B. Say. Under fixed capital a very elaborate treatment of the nature and economic influence of machines is given, while the handling of changes in the cost of production, both here and in the essay on “Profit,” is acute and luminous. The sixth essay analyses the forces which underlie supply and demand. These are stated to be: (a) on the side of the purchaser : : (1) his desire for the commodity in question, or its utility to him :(2) his means :(3) the competition of sellers (b) on the side of the seller : : (1) cost of production :(2) competition of the buyers :(3) the value of the medium of exchange The same considerations are shown to hold good in the case of the price of labour, though unfortunately the seventh essay, on “Wages,” is incomplete. The eighth essay, on “Profit,” discusses very elaborately the rate of return on the various species of capital and the circumstances that determine it, distinguishes interest from profit in general, and marks as a special form the “profit of the entrepreneur” (). This last he regards as distinct from wages of superintendence, and from insurance for risk. The ninth and tenth essays, on “Revenue” and “Consumption,” are perhaps specially interesting from the clear mode in which the theory, afterwards called that of the wages fund, is rejected, and from the precision with which the diverse points of view for estimating net revenue are discriminated. This brief analysis characterizes Hermann's work in pure economics. On practical questions, those of economic legislation, his opinions are only to be gathered with difficulty from the papers in the Gelehrte Anzeigen, and generally were expressed with such reference to special circumstances as to render doubtful their full import. It seems probable, however, that his views on protection were far from clear, and that he was somewhat under the sway of the principle that the best financial policy is encouragement of national industry. Appreciation Hermann's rare technological knowledge gave him a great advantage in dealing with some economic questions. He reviewed the principal fundamental ideas of the science with great thoroughness and acuteness. \\"His strength,\\" says Roscher, \\"lies in his clear, sharp, exhaustive distinction between the several elements of a complex conception, or the several steps comprehended in a complex act.\\" For keen analytical power his German brethren compare him with Ricardo. But he avoids several one-sided views of the English economist. Thus he places public spirit beside egoism as an economic motor, regards price as not measured by labour only but as a product of several factors, and habitually contemplates the consumption of the labourer, not as a part of the cost of production to the capitalist, but as the main practical end of economics.

Life and career Derenne undertook studies in architecture while also pursuing vocal studies with Marguerite Babaïan. She recommended him to Reynaldo Hahn (who suggested his stage name based on his home town). After taking part in a competition in 1935 organised by the magazine Comœdia, he made his debut under Charles Munch in the French premiere of Hin und Zurück by Hindemith.Machart R. Portrait.

Hugues Cuénod, who also took part, introduced him to Nadia Boulanger from which he took part in the historic recording of Monteverdi madrigals, which won the Grand Prix du Disque for 1937. Derenne made his debut at the Paris Opéra Comique in 1937 in the French premieres of Le testament de la tante Caroline by Albert Roussel (Noel) and of Ariadne auf Naxos by Richard Strauss (Brighella) alongside de Germaine Lubin and Janine Micheau, both operas conducted by Roger Désormière.Wolff S. Un demi-siècle d'Opéra-Comique (1900-1950). André Bonne, Paris, 1953. Called up in 1940 and captured by the Germans, he was imprisoned at Longvic, near Dijon. Freed after a few months, Derenne joined the company of the Palais de Chaillot, singing many leading lyric roles of the opéra comique repertoire, such as Fortunio, George Brown in La dame blanche, Almaviva in Il Barbiere di Siviglia (in French) and Gérald in Lakmé. He also sang in the first performance of surviving fragments of Chabrier's Vaucochard et Fils 1er on 22 April 1941 at the Salle du Conservatoire.Delage R. Emmanuel Chabrier. Paris, Fayard, 1999, p693. During the Occupation he came to know Henri Sauguet, and sang in the premiere of La Gageure imprévue (Détieulette) at the Opéra Comique in 1944, also premiering the song cycle 'Les Pénitents en maillot rose', (poems by Max Jacob). Sauguet introduced Derenne to other members of Groupe des Six and also recorded Socrate with him in 1954. He premiered many mélodies of Jacques Leguerney, including \\"Poèmes de la Pléiade, 1er Recueil. After the war Derenne appeared in Great Britain, at the Edinburgh Festival, in Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and Italy, where he appeared at Fenice in Venice and La Scala in Milan in L'heure espagnole and L'Enfant et les sortilèges, which he recorded under Ernest Ansermet in 1953. With Henri Sauguet he participated in many radio concerts exploring the repertoire of the French mélodie. After retiring from singing he taught for many years.

The damage to Japan's infrastructure prompted delays in software and hardware releases, and also caused outright cancellations when the subject matter of the software was considered too similar to real-life events. At the same time, the Japanese gaming industry took on relief efforts to assist those most directly affected by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Members of the gaming industry contributed donations to support foundations including several large donations from video game-oriented companies such as Nintendo, Sony Computer Entertainment, Namco Bandai, Sega Sammy, Capcom, and Tecmo Koei, and have also encouraged donations from individuals. Several online games helped donate money to the relief effort, including EVE Online and Zynga's Facebook games. Thirty-six hours after the initial tremor, Zynga has gathered donations adding up to $1.35 million. Background A 9.0-magnitude megathrust earthquake occurred off the coast of Japan on 11 March 2011. The epicenter was off the east coast of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku near Sendai, with the hypocenter at a depth of . The earthquake triggered extremely destructive tsunami waves of up to that struck Japan minutes after the quake, in some cases traveling up to inland, with smaller waves reaching many other countries after several hours. Tsunami warnings were issued and evacuations ordered along Japan's Pacific coast and at least 20 other countries, including the entire Pacific coast of North America and South America. Aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that took place near Tōhoku, Japan. The Japanese National Police Agency officially confirmed a large number of casualties across seventeen prefectures. The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive and severe damage in Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water. Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors suffered explosions due to hydrogen buildup within their outer containment buildings. Estimates of the Tōhoku earthquake's magnitude make it the most powerful known earthquake to hit Japan, and one of the five most powerful earthquakes in the world overall since modern record-keeping began in 1900. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said that the crisis was the country's \\"toughest and most difficult\\" since World War II.{ The earthquake moved Honshu east and shifted the Earth on its axis by almost . Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered ¥15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March 2011 in an effort to normalize market conditions. Effects on business The disaster resulted in a drop in stocks at the Tokyo Stock Exchange for many video game companies at the Monday close following. Eurogamer's Gamesindustry.biz website reported that Sega Sammy's dropped 13.5 percent, ending up at ¥1530; Tecmo Koei's fell 10.7 percent to ¥626; Konami's fell 9.9 percent to ¥1610; Sony's fell 9.1 percent to ¥2550; Nintendo's fell 7.6 percent to ¥21,280; Namco Bandai's fell 6.4 percent to ¥905; and Square Enix's fell 6.2 percent to ¥1370. Edge also reported drops, but lower amounts for Sega Sammy, Nintendo, and Square Enix: 1.3 percent, 1.1 percent, and 4.5 percent, respectively. Capcom's shares fell 14.4 percent, and the company announced closures of ten amusement arcades in the Tōhoku and Kantō regions due to damage. The top 20 titles sold around 568,000 units between 6 and 12 March. In the same time period, the top 10 video game systems sold close to 195,000 units. Anoop Gantayat writing for IGN, however, speculated that most video game sales in Japan stopped when the earthquake occurred. Gamasutra's Tom Cutris noted that most titles on Japan's charts dropped in sales the following week; the top 20 titles sold approximately 275,000 units. He further noted that the top seller, Dynasty Warriors 7, sold 75 percent fewer copies compared to the previous week, when it debuted at number one. No employees of Japan's gaming community have been reported as casualties of the quake or the subsequent tsunami. IGN writers noted that most video game companies are a \\"significant distance\\" from the earthquake's epicenter. Soon after the disaster struck, rumors began circulating that Pokémon series creator Satoshi Tajiri, among other Japanese celebrities, had died in the tsunami; however, this turned out to be false when he tweeted that he was, in fact, alive. Several artists and designers used their online presences on social networking sites to provide information not only on their own situations, but to inform others of the disaster's impact. Hideo Kojima, Masahiro Sakurai, Goichi Suda and Fumito Ueda used their Twitter accounts to pass on information, with Suda encouraging his colleagues to seek shelter. Kojima announced that he would be leaving his offices for power saving reasons. Ace Attorney series art director Tatsuro Iwamoto illustrated an image of characters from the series saying \\"Let's work hard and not be defeated by the earthquake!!\\". Nintendo's American subsidiary in Redmond, Washington provided updates on the status of the company headquarters and its employees. =Delays and cancellations= When asked if the Nintendo 3DS' launch in Europe and North America would be affected by the situation, Nintendo gave indication that the former will be unaffected. It elaborated that business operations and future product shipments would be unaffected. Video games analyst Michael Pachter commented that it was difficult to assess how much impact the disaster will have, commenting that a company like Nintendo will not suffer as many set backs in the release of software as other companies have, such as Sony. He noted that if the threat of a nuclear plant meltdown grows stronger, the industry could be placed in much more dire straits. Pachter also noted that while Japanese software delays would not impact the United States market, hardware shortages could. Related hardware manufacturing industries have also indirectly affected video gaming. For example, Japan's manufacturers make up 70% of world's supply of anisotropic conductive films for LCD production, and can, among other devices, affect Nintendo DS panel production. The iPad, which companies began developing games for soon after its release, was expected to be available in short supply due to components that are manufactured in Japan. Apple indefinitely delayed the Japanese release of the iPad 2. Due to production disruptions, Sony announced that it may decide to limit the initial release of PlayStation Vita to one region by the end of 2011. Investment research company Zachs described the situation as uncertain, adding that if there is a radiation leak at Fukushima's nuclear plants, it could shut down operations all over Japan. Early screesnhot of Ryū ga Gotoku Of the End, depicting a city in ruin. It was erroneously believed to portray an \\"earthquake or other natural disaster\\". The disaster's effects on Japan has affected a number of planned releases. Jesse Divnich, an analyst for EEDAR, expected video game delays to be the biggest impact of the disaster on the video game industry, asserting this as being due to the inflexibility of development schedules. Kevin Gifford of 1UP.com noted that the country's \\"strained\\" distribution networks and the number of consumers focused on the events of the disaster would result in losses should a video game be released. Some games, due to their subject matter being perceived as too similar to the real-life events, have had their releases delayed indefinitely, including Sony Computer Entertainment's MotorStorm: Apocalypse. While it has entered distribution channels in the United Kingdom, Sony announced that they will cease any further shipments and remove marketing material for it. Sega similarly delayed their video game, Ryū ga Gotoku Of the End, indefinitely. Early in Ryū ga Gotoku Of the Ends unveiling, it was mistakenly thought to depict an \\"earthquake or other natural disaster.\\" Irem's upcoming release of Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4: Summer Memories and Poncotsu Roman Daikatsugeki Bumpy Trot 2 has been cancelled altogether (with the former being re-announced in 2015 with a different title, developer and platform), with the publisher issuing an apology; the game would have been the fourth in a series of survival action games where players would need to escape a city after the onset of a major disaster, specifically a large earthquake in Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4. Pre- release orders reportedly rose after the disaster. There have been delays of video games that are not related to earthquakes or disasters; Nintendo delayed the release of their Nintendo 3DS video game Steel Diver in Japan from its original release date of 17 March, Major League Baseball 2K11 and Top Spin 4 were both delayed from their intended release date of April, and Toaru Kagaku no Railgun for the PlayStation Portable. The delay of Steel Diver is in spite of a statement by Nintendo that it would not postpone the release of any games. Microsoft delayed the release of Dragon Age Origins: Awakening due to \\"distribution disruption\\", Capcom delayed the first download content pack for Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds in Japan and Ubisoft similarly delayed download content for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood in Japan. Some companies took steps to conserve energy by shutting down servers used for Internet gaming. Square Enix shut down its servers for Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, while Konami suspended the servers for Metal Gear Online indefinitely. The two Final Fantasy games along with the PlayOnline service accounted for 11 percent of Square Enix's energy consumption the previous month. After implementing other energy consumption efforts to reduce energy usage by over 10 percent, including lighting reduction and ceasing office climate control, the company planned to restart the services on 25 March. Nintendo shut down service for Pokémon Global Link, a feature that was part of the newest additions to the franchise. Due to this shutdown, the release date of the feature for other countries has been delayed. Hitachi, one of Nintendo's suppliers for the manufacture of its Nintendo DS handheld system, has indicated that deliveries of its materials may be delayed, depending on whether its factories are shut down for a period of time. Sony announced that while PlayStation Network services for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable would not be interrupted, users may experience connection problems, and some content updates will be delayed. Sony later urged PSN users to back up their data. Microsoft delayed the launch of some of their Xbox 360's Xbox Live features that they had planned to release in the week following the disaster. In Japan, Sony temporarily closed their call centers, while it and Microsoft both closed their repair centers. A number of gaming-related events were canceled in the wake of the disaster. These include a number of demos for video games such as BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II, Dragon Ball Zenkai Battle Royal, and others. An event planned to be held for the release of Ryū ga Gotoku Of the End to allow fans to have their copies signed in Hiroshima and Osaka was also canceled. A Monster Hunter themed event called \\"Monster Hunter Festa\\" was also cancelled. Microsoft delayed a tour to advertise its Kinect controller. The video game tournament Evolution vs Godsgarden was canceled over logistic concerns related to the disaster's impact. The earthquake had a significant impact on the ending of Chunsoft's Virtue's Last Reward. The ending of the game is a cliffhanger that depicts humanity's downfall due to a virus infection and mass-suicide; this included a scene in which a newscaster commits suicide live on air. Writer and director Kotaro Uchikoshi felt that the ending on its own would be inappropriate following the Tōhoku earthquake, and so an extra \\"non-canonical\\" meta ending was added onto the end to lighten the mood. Donations and assistance =Japanese response= Several Japanese video game publishers donated relief to Japan; this includes Nintendo, which donated 300 million yen; Sony, which donated 300 million yen and 30,000 radios; Sega Sammy, which donated 200 million yen, and Namco Bandai, Capcom, and Tecmo Koei, which donated 100 million each. CyberConnect2 opened its offices and offered aid to 30 people from the general public. Sega promised to donate all proceeds earned from Football Manager 2011 and its Sonic the Hedgehog titles available for iOS platforms for a week, beginning on 15 March 2011. Capcom lowered the price of the iOS version of Street Fighter IV from $4.99 to $0.99, donating the proceeds of its sales from that point on to tsunami relief. iOS developer 5pb. slashed the prices of its games from ¥2200 to ¥350 and donating all proceeds to the Red Cross until 31 March. Arc System Works employee Toshimichi Mori commented that he was in talks with his company on making download content to donate some of the proceeds. Nippon Ichi announced that the earnings from the download content release of a character in Disgaea 4 for ¥100 under the name \\"Fans of Disgaea 4\\". Square Enix pledged to donate ¥100 million, as well as giving gamers with Square Enix accounts to use points called \\"Square Enix Crysta\\" to donate. They also set up a \\"worldwide employee charity fund\\". Level-5 donated 10 million yen, as well as pledging to release charity items through its video game Inazuma Eleven Mobile. =International response= Online gaming publications have launched relief drives of their own. IGN started up a fundraiser, wherein its staff plays 24 Japanese-made games in 24 hours in an attempt to garner donations of $24,000, while Brian Crecente of Kotaku will host the Japan Earthquake Relief Fundraiser on 24 March 2011 in Denver, Colorado, in which proceeds will go to the Japanese Red Cross Society. Game Informers Meagan Marie put up for auction her Mario-themed Nintendo DS autographed by several people with links to Nintendo, including Shigeru Miyamoto, Koji Kondo, Eiji Aonuma, Charles Martinet, and Martin Leung, with the proceeds to go to Japanese relief. Siliconera put up for auction an action figure of the fictional character Cecil from Dissidia: Final Fantasy, signed by Final Fantasy IV designer Takashi Tokita. The industry's online auction efforts organized into Play For Japan, which acts as an online hub for auctions of collectible video game paraphernalia. Non-Japanese video game companies also provided assistance. Mastiff, in addition to a sum of money already donated, pledged to donate $100 for every 100 Facebook likes their page receives, up to $25,000 worth. Shawnimals discounted two video games, Wee Ninja and Wee Devil, to $10, pledging to donate all profits made to the relief fund. EVE Online players are able to donate the game's in-game currency, which will be converted into real- world money and given to the Red Cross, and players of select Facebook games by Zynga, such as FarmVille and CityVille, can purchase special in-game items, whose profits would go to helping support the Japanese relief effort. 36 hours in, Zynga has collected approximately $1.35 million. ScrewAttack announced that all profits made from their game, Texting of the Bread, would go to the American Red Cross.

Boundaries in medieval romance, 2008, , 9781843841555. pp. 29–42. It is presented in a style of rhymed couplets and described by Skeat as \\"the older and longer kind of ballad\\" and by Ramsey as a \\"rough and ready romance.\\"Knight, Stephen, and Thomas H. Ohlgren. “The Tale of Gamelyn: Introduction.” Robin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales (1997). Print. This 900-line romance is set during the reign of King Edward I and tells the story of Gamelyn, and the various obstacles he must overcome in order to retrieve his rightful inheritance from his older brother. The tale confronts the corruption of the law, illuminating a lack of moral and political consistency. There is no indication as to where exactly this story takes place, given that the text itself has no place names, and Gamelyn's family name of Boundys most likely just signifies a type of boundary. Although The Tale of Gamelyn is included among Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in two early manuscripts, where it follows the unfinished Cook's Tale, modern scholars do not consider this to be written by Chaucer, although it is possible that he had included the character of Gamelyn among his papers, with the intention of rewriting it for a suitable character. He may perhaps have wanted to construct a version of it for use as the Cook's tale.Skeat argued instead that Chaucer intended the tale for the Yeoman, who would presumably be more interested in a tale of country life. The Tale of Gamelyn shares similarities with other stories from English literary and folk traditions. It is of particular interest for its similarities with the English ballad of the legendary outlaw Robin Hood. It was also a source for Thomas Lodge’s prose romance Rosalynde (1590), on which William Shakespeare based his As You Like It.Ohlgren, Thomas H. Medieval Outlaws: Twelve Tales in Modern English Translation. West Lafayette, IN: Parlor, 2005. Print. The Tale of Gamelyn is thought to provide a transition between the mid 14th century and the late 15th century world of early romances and Robin Hood ballads . Plot The Tale of Gamelyn is the story of a younger son, left at his father’s death in the care of a wicked elder brother, who seeks to cheat him out of his inheritance. The tale opens with the old knight Sir Johan of Boundys on his death-bed. He knows his end is near, and he has called his neighbours so that in their presence, he may divide his lands among his three sons. He knows that his neighbours will try to cheat the young Gamelyn of his share, but the old man is determined to have his own way: ‘Then seyde the knight I sware by Seynt Martin, For al that ye have y-doon yit is the land myn.’http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/tale-of-gamelyn With his last words he divides all his lands; five ploughlands to the eldest son, five more to the second, and all that remains will go to Gamelyn. The neighbours leave, Sir Johan dies, and Gamelyn is left at the mercy of his eldest brother. Gamelyn grows up in his brother's hall, and while his lands were held in ward by his brother, they were wasted and have gone to ruin. He grows up tall and strong, and as he stands in his brother's yard one day, he begins to think of his wasted lands, and he becomes determined to claim his inheritance. He seeks out his brother, and there begins their long and furious quarrel. They argue over his inheritance, then the elder brother calls his men to bind and beat the boy, however Gamelyn attacks them with a pestle then shuts himself in the hay loft. There he threatened to break every bone in the body of any who came near him, unless his brother will give him back his land. Realizing he is beaten for the moment, the brother in his cunning tells Gamelyn he only wished to try his strength, and if he would live with him he would have his land, his kiss of peace, and more: ‘Thy land, that lyth laye, full wel it schal be sowe, And thyn houses reysed up, that ben layd so lowe’ So Gamelyn has his peace and his land, and for the moment they live happily together. Soon after a wrestling was cried in the country, and ‘there was set up a ram and a ryng’, the traditional prize for the man that could overthrow the champion. Gamelyn makes a decision to try his luck, and as he tells his brother, it will bring great worship to the family if he can return with the trophies. Gamelyn sets off, but as he nears the spot, he meets a poor franklin weeping, who tells him that the wrestling champion has slain his two sons. Gamelyn makes a promise to avenge him, so he leaves his horse and his shirt with the franklin and hurries to the ring. He easily beats the champion and is presented with the ram and the ring ‘for the best wrasteler that ever here came.’ He thanks the wardens for his prize, then proceeds to invite all at the fair to accompany him home to celebrate his triumph in the hall. Gamelyn had not reckoned on his brother's reactions, he had hoped that a broken neck would solve the family problems, and he has no intention of entertaining the mob at his home. When he sees the ‘rowte’ in the distance he tells his porter to bar the gate and to let no man pass. Gamelyn kicks down the door, breaks the fleeing porter's neck, and throws his lifeless body into the well in the courtyard. He then goes to the gate and opens in wide: ‘He let in alle maner men that goon in wold or ryd, And seyde ‘Ye be welcome, withouten eny greeve, For wee will be maistres here and aske no man leeve’ Five tuns of wine are broached, and Gamelyn swore that none should leave while a drop was left. The feast lasted seven days and nights, and at the end, Gamelyn farewells his guests and proceeds to fetch his brother who had taken refuge in the cellar. The brother tells Gamelyn that he will make him his heir, but to avenge the death of his porter, and to preserve his honour, he asks that Gamelyn allow himself to be bound hand and foot. Gamely naively agrees and is therefore fettered to a post in the dining-hall where he stands without food, for all to mock. He turns to Adam the Spencer, who makes a promise to bring him food and loosen his bonds. Adam had been his father's man, and he has more to add to the plan. He tells Gamelyn that his brother has arranged a feast for the next Sunday; all the great churchmen will be there, but before they come, Adam has promised to unlock Gamelyn's fetters. In the middle of the meal it is planned that the churchmen should speak to Gamelyn's brother on his behalf; in which case, Gamelyn would be free and no suspicion need fall on Adam. But if they would not, then Gamelyn should, when Adam gave the sign, throw away his fetters, and then: ‘Thow schalt have a good staff and I wil have another, And Cristes curs have that oon that faileth that other.’ When the day arrived, the abbots and Gamelyn's brother sat at meat; Gamelyn stood tethered at the end of the hall; his brother told them he was mad, and to his appeals they replied with solemn curses. Meanwhile, Adam had fetched two staves and brought them to the door; suddenly the prisoner threw aside his fetters, and the guests found themselves facing two angry men armed with clubs. There was no one to help them; Gamelyn had always been the champion of the servants, and they had no intention of helping an oppressive master and his associates, even though they were churchmen. Gamelyn and Adam attacked the guests and not a man escaped unhurt: ‘Thider they came rydyng jolily with swaynes, But home agen they were y-lad in cartes and waynes.’ With one blow Gamelyn felled his brother, then set him in his own fetters to ‘cool his blood’, while the servants brought him all the best fare in the house. While Gamelyn was celebrating his release, word had been sent to the sheriff of the affair, and four-and-twenty men had formed a posse to capture the offenders. Gamelyn was informed of their coming by his new porter who ran in with the news that there were foemen at the gate. He and Adam drove away the first group, but soon they saw a great rout coming with the sheriff at their head, it was time to leave. While the sheriff was searching the house and attending to Gamelyn's brother, the two fugitives were running through the woods. In the forest they came upon a group of outlaws, and as they peered under the branches of a tree, they saw the ‘master outlaw’. At first the outlaws took them for the law's spies, and seven men brought them before their ‘king’. Gamelyn assured him that they were also on the run, so he made them join with his men at their meal. The master outlaw enrolled them in his band, and before long Gamelyn was made master under him. They were with the outlaws for less than three weeks when the news came that their master's friend had a pardon for him from the king. He took his leave and returned to his land, and Gamelyn was crowned King of the outlaws in his place. Meanwhile, his outlawry was made public; his brother was healed of his broken back, and for the new term he himself was made sheriff. Gamelyn's lands were seized, and in accordance with law, his peasants paid fine to the sheriff, as they would to a new lord when the old died, for to the law, Gamelyn was now dead. However, he was a lord they loved, and the new master was harsh; so his bondmen kept their loyalty to him and he was informed of how things stood with him and his land. Gamelyn regretted that he had not killed his brother, and the welfare of his peasants and their wives he could not overlook. He swore that he would be at the next shire court to uphold their cause, and he was as good as his word. Gamelyn went to the shire court alone, and as an outlaw he had no right at law (it is clear that the author of this poem knew the law quite well): when he walked into the ‘moot hall’, he had put himself in the sheriff's power. He had no right to speak in his own defence, he was allowed no chance to; he was bound and fettered and cast into the sheriff's prison to await the assize. Although he was in the sheriff's power, he still had some use of the law; he had another brother, Sir Ote, the ‘myddeleste’ of Sir John's sons, and he received word of Gamelyn's imprisonment. Ote was as honourable as his elder brother was treacherous; as soon as he heard the news he saddled his horse and rode to the sheriff. The elder brother was deaf to his pleas for family feeling, but he could not refuse to bail Gamelyn if his brother stood surety for him. Gamelyn was released, and returned to Sir Ote's house with him. As he was still King of the outlaws, he planned to return to the forest to see how things stood with them: ‘To see how my younge men leden her lyf Whether they lyven in joie or elles in stryf.’ Ote tried to dissuade him; he was afraid that once with his men in the forest, Gamelyn would not return, and as his mainpernor he himself would be bound and tried in his place. Gamelyn swore that he would be back on the day of the assize, and so he sets off and finds ‘his mery men under woode bough.’ He stays in the forest until the day of the assize, adding to his list of charges by the plunder of any rich churchmen who pass his way. In the meantime his elder brother set about packing the jury with one or more bribed men to hang Gamelyn: ‘The fals knight his brother forgat he nat that, To hyre the men on his quest to hangen his brother; Though he hadde nought that oon he wolde have that other.’ The day of the assize arrived; the lords of the county came to the ‘moot hall’, the King's justice was sitting, and Sir Ote was taken and brought to court in fetters. The case was dealt with briefly; the jury delivered their verdict, and the judge of assize gave his sentence that Sir Ote should hang as an outlaw. Gamelyn had not failed his brother; when the verdict was delivered, Adam the Spencer was at the back of the court, and all the outlaws were outside waiting for his report on the proceedings. Adam slipped out and told Gamelyn, who stationed his men at the door, then he himself strode into the hall, for as he said, he would that day be justice himself. No one moved as he went in, as they could see the outlaws outside. Gamelyn loosed his brother, then crossed to the justice's seat: ‘The justice sat still, and roose not anoon; And Gamelyn clevede his cheeke boon; Gamelyn took him in the arm, and no more spake, But threw him over the barre, and his arm to-brak.’ Gamelyn then took the justice's seat, and put Sir Ote beside him; his men entered, and bound the justice and the sheriff. Next, the jury that had judged Sir Ote were bound and fettered as well. A jury was quickly assembled from among the outlaws, and a verdict and sentence hastily delivered, and put to immediate execution: ‘The justice and the scherreve both hanged hye, To weyven with ropes and with the wynd drye; And the twelve sisours, sorwe have that rekke! Alle they were hanged faste by the nekke.’ The tables were turned, the outlaws had sat in judgment on the law itself, and right had won. The story now ends quickly; Gamelyn and Ote get safe conduct to the King, and they obtain his pardon. Sir Ote is made his justice, and Gamelyn is made Chief Justice of the Forest. The other outlaws are pardoned and Gamelyn gets back his land and his people. He and Sir Ote return home, to live and die in prosperity. The poem ends with the following moral words: ‘They liveden togidere whil that Crist wolde, And sithen was Gamelyn graven under molde. And so schal we al, may ther no man fle, God bryng us to the joye that ever schal be.’  Characters  * Sir Johan of Boundys: father of Gamelyn, Ote and an unnamed eldest son.

Arguments  There were various expansions of the Cook's Tale which Chaucer never finished – The Plowman's Tale, The Tale of Gamelyn, the Siege of Thebes, and The Tale of Beryn. It is argued that The Tale of Gamelyn was not, in fact, composed by Chaucer. Instead, it is thought to be merely a setup for future works. Though Chaucer wrote the Canterbury Tales and The Tale of Gamelyn is supposed to be included, it is considered an anonymous work. In addition, The Tale of Gamelyn is included in two early manuscript versions of the Tales, British Library, MS Harley 7334 and Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 198, both once notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration.

In a career that lasted from March 2002 until April 2009, he ran thirty-five times and won 15 races, ten of them at Grade I level. including the 2006 Champion Hurdle. From 2005 until he was retired, Brava Inca ran in sixteen successive Grade I races. Background Brave Inca was bred in Ireland by D W McAuley. His sire was Good Thyne, an American-bred stallion who produced the winners of over 600 jumps races in Britain and Ireland. He was the first foal of his dam, the unraced Wigwam Mam. He was sold as a foal for 1,600gns at Tattersalls and as a yearling for IR£6,000, eventually becoming the property of the Novices Syndicate. He was trained throughout his career by Colm Murphy in the village of Killenagh, near Gorey, County Wexford. Early career (2001-2004) Brave Inca began his career by running unplaced in minor hurdle races at Navan and Wexford in March of the 2001/2002 season. The following season began similarly with down-the-field efforts in minor hurdle events at Fairyhouse and Naas. In these two races, he was ridden by Barry Cash, who became his regular jockey for the next three seasons. In March 2003, he was switched to National Hunt flat races and began to show improvement, winning \\"bumpers\\" at Fairyhouse and Navan by wide margins. Because of his early failures, Brave Inca entered the 2003/2004 season as a novice hurdler. He then went unbeaten in five starts. After picking up two handicaps before Christmas, he won his first major prize by defeating Newmill in the Grade I Deloitte Novice Hurdle. At Cheltenham, he was sent off 7-2 favourite for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle and won by a neck over future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner War of Attrition. The win provoked \\"near-hysterical\\" celebrations among the large Irish contingent, with Colm Murphy being carried shoulder-high into the winner's enclosure. In his final start of the season in the Evening Herald Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown, Brave Inca defeated the English-trained Top Novices' Hurdle winner Royal Shakespeare by a short head. Rise to the Championship (2004-2006) O'Brien's thatched pub at Killenagh, a gathering point for Brave Inca's supporters In the 2004/5 season, Brave Inca won once from seven starts. On his debut at Dromore in November, he narrowly failed to give 10 lbs to Macs Joy, a horse he met many times over the subsequent seasons. Later in the same month, he ran second to the mare Solerina in the two-and-a-half-mile Hatton's Grace Hurdle. Two more second places followed in the December Festival Hurdle and the Irish Champion Hurdle with Macs Joy victorious on both occasions. Brave Inca was sent off as a 10-1 chance for his first attempt at the Champion Hurdle in March 2005. In an eventful race, he finished third, beaten two necks by Hardy Eustace, who won his second championship, and Harchibald, who had seemed certain to win after the final hurdle. As a result of this effort, Brave Inca was sent off 2-1 favourite for the Aintree Hurdle but fell for the first and only time in his career. A season of near-misses ended as he rallied after being headed close home to defeat Harchibald and Macs Joy in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle, in which he was ridden for the first time by Tony McCoy Although he was already seven years old at the start of the 2005/6 season, Brave Inca appeared to be reaching his peak, an impression that was confirmed when McCoy rode him to victory in the Morgiana Hurdle, beating Harchibald and Macs Joy again. After another failed attempt at the Hatton's Grace Hurdle, he confirmed his superiority over the best two-mile hurdlers in Ireland with an \\"easy\\" and \\"convincing\\" victory in the December Festival Hurdle after which he was quoted as 5-1 joint favourite for the Championship. A triumph in the Irish Champion Hurdle meant that he was seen as the potential champion by the time of the 2006 Cheltenham Festival Sent off 7-4 favourite in a field of 18, Brave Inca landed the odds in the Champion Hurdle, winning by a length from Macs Joy, with Hardy Eustace three lengths back in third. \\"He's all there\\", said Murphy after the race. \\"He's a complete horse now.\\" On his final start of the season, Brave Inca finished second to Macs Joy in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle. Later career In 2006/7, Brave Inca won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle at his third attempt and a second December Festival Hurdle, as well as finishing runner-up in the Irish Champion Hurdle. In the Champion Hurdle, he defeated most of the leading contenders, including Detroit City and Hardy Eustace, but finished second, three lengths behind the surprise 16-1 winner Sublimity. Brave Inca missed the whole of the 2007/8 season with a tendon injury but returned in 2008/9. Although now well past his best, he managed one last major victory by winning the Irish Champion Hurdle at the age of 11,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/26/brave-inca-irish-champion- hurdle after which Colm Murphy described him as \\"unbelievable, one in a million. He's as tough as nails\\". Retirement Brave Inca was retired from racing after running down the field in the 2009 Champion Hurdle. He has not, however, retired from competition, becoming a successful show-horse. He has also been used to raise funds for the \\"Playing for Life\\" charity by taking part in a \\"Man vs Horse\\" race at Leopardstown in December 2010.

The game allows the player to warp through doors and objects and cause creatures in the game world to explode. It was released on February 15, 2012 on Xbox Live Arcade as part of the second \\"Xbox Live Arcade House Party\\", with PlayStation Network and Microsoft Windows releases to follow on March 13, 2012. Plot The game opens from a first person view of the player being pulled out of what appears to be a cave by a group of scientists. The player's character, \\"Zero\\", is confused and dazed as they take him to a military-grade secure facility. Zero fades in and out of consciousness, and eventually awakens to see two scientists performing surgery on him and extracting a disk- shaped object. Soon after, a fellow alien contacts Zero through telepathy and says that it can sense other aliens in the facility and that they should escape together. The scientists then put Zero through an obstacle course where Zero is reunited with the disk they extracted, giving him back his power to teleport. After reabsorbing the disk, the player's goal is to escape the facility and help any fellow aliens on the way out. The game has three endings: Bad ending: kill more than 170 humans to get this ending. Zero heads outside in the rain and is killed by a sniper. Good ending: kill fewer than 7 humans to get this one. Zero heading outside in the sun and running in victory. Neutral ending: kill more than 7 humans but fewer than 170 humans to get this ending. Zero is ambushed by a small group of soldiers but effortlessly slays them. Gameplay Despite being a 3D game, the gameplay remains similar to a top-down 2D game that features puzzle solving and stealth. The first power Zero acquires is the ability to teleport short distances, also known as the titular Warp. Zero is able to warp through open spaces, through objects, into objects, and into living things. The speed between warps is dependent on whether Zero moves into an object or into open space. Moving into open space gives Zero a slight timed penalty before it can warp again. From inside an object (or person), Zero can move around vigorously and eventually make it explode. This is known as a Frag. Guards, scientists, and turrets attempt to stop Zero's escape. Upon sight of Zero both turrets and guards will attempt to shoot, while scientists will cower and run away. Once spotted by one human they will most likely alert other humans of Zero's presence. Alarms that are activated can be turned off by destroying the alarm coil or moving it off the alarm pad. Sound and sight also play a prominent role in the game. Zero is about half the size of the average human and so is able to hide behind many objects that are scattered across the map without being seen. Sound will also alert the guards to Zero's presence. Footsteps, knocking into objects, and Zero's powers will create sounds audible to the human ears prompting an investigation, though many of these sounds can be made inaudible through upgrades. Upgrades can be purchased at stations throughout the game. Upgrades cost grub energy that has been collected throughout Zero's journey. Grubs are small parasite-like creatures that cling to objects and give off a purple glow. This glow makes them easier to spot, although many of these grubs are located in hard to reach places and require extra skill or more powers to reach. Once a grub is found, Zero consumes it and absorbs its energy. Zero will come across puddles of water early on in the game and discovers that being exposed to small amounts of water will nullify his powers temporarily. This is indicated by Zero having a sudden loss of color and a different walking animation. Unfortunately for Zero, the scientists also discover this weakness. They exploit this weakness by creating a malleable water substance that they primarily use as a shield. Zero can't walk, warp, echo, or use a hologram to get past these shields. When exposed to large quantities of water, Zero will die. The facility is located underwater. Throughout the game, Zero will find remains of other aliens and will be able to absorb their old powers in order to aid his escape. The second power Zero unlocks is a solid hologram, known as Echo. Zero's echo ghost will move independently from him, but Zero is unable to move when this power is activated. All enemies can see Zero's echo but they can't tell it apart from the real Zero. If Zero's echo is killed, it will dissipate. The hologram can pass through all objects and move across gaps but will also dissipate when it comes into contact with water. The echo's movement is restricted to within a certain radius around Zero's position. When Zero activates this power inside an object, the hologram will take on the image and properties of the object. Guards, scientists, and turrets will only notice the object if it is not stationary. When Zero activates this power inside a person, whether the human is alive or dead, the echo will be of that person walking and enemies won't notice anything wrong. The third power is known as Swap. This power is an extension of the echo and allows Zero's echo to swap places with an object of the player's choice. The swap power can be used as an extended warp in many situations. The power will only work when the end destination is an object. If Zero is inside an object while swap is used, the destination object will be placed inside the original object. This causes the internal object to destroy the external object and take its place. This technique can be used to destroy objects/humans and create distractions. The fourth power is known as Launch. Launch allows Zero to fire an object at a high velocity. The launched object won't be affected by gravity during this time. Launch will only launch an object when Zero is already warped inside of it and will leave Zero in the position of where the object was launched from. This power is primarily used to destroy power generators to access different levels of the map. It can also be used to place objects strategically so Zero can use echo to cross large spaces that were previously unreachable. Game modes There are two game modes featured in Warp. The first is the story mode where players spend their time solving puzzles and ultimately escaping from the facility. During the story, players can discover challenge orbs which can be activated by warping into them. Once Zero is warped into them, they are unlocked and accessible through the main menu. The challenge mode places Zero in a training room and gives the player one objective. The rewards for completing these objectives are tiered: a bronze grub, a silver grub, and a gold grub. The bronze grub is always given for completing the objective and is the lowest tier of reward. The silver and gold grub is often given out in reward for completing the objective in shorter times respectively. These challenges are often placed in the story mode to help train the player for a new type of challenge/puzzle that is coming up. They often require critical thinking or advanced skills in order to attain the silver grub. The times that players complete the challenges are recorded and put up on a leader board to see how a player compares to others. Reception According to the review aggregator Metacritic, the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows versions of Warp received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from publications upon release, while the Xbox 360 version received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews. Daemon Hatfield of IGN scored the game an 8.5 out of 10. Hatfield's review was mostly positive, with his only problems with the game being its lack of polish, which he pinned down to lower production values, and ending levels. Even though Hatfield particularly disliked the final boss fight for being the \\"opposite of fun\\", he said that the game's level design and core mechanics make up for it by being \\"so much damn fun\\". Hatfield also spoke positively of the premise of being an alien against humans, rather than a human against aliens, the humour, and the difficulty balance. GameSpot's Jeremiah Johnson was more critical of the game, summarizing his review by saying: \\"It's best to take Warp as the carefree fling it's likely meant to be, because anyone looking for a rewarding experience here will find only a charmingly warped vision of games we've seen many times before.\\" Johnson praised the enjoyability of the puzzles, the \\"charming mix of gore and cuteness\\", the overall presentation, and the leaderboards. Johnson's main criticisms were concerning the controls and the \\"trial and error\\"-nature of some puzzles and encounters. Game Informer's Dan Ryckert also had mixed feelings, stating: \\"Warp is charming at first, but the simple A.I. and basic puzzles aren’t enough to make it an XBLA standout. Completionists may find replay value in the collectible grubs, basic upgrade system, and challenge rooms, but anyone looking for deeper stealth or puzzle- based gameplay should look elsewhere.\\" Ryckert scored the game a 6.75 out of 10. Dan Whitehead for Eurogamer scored the game a 7/10 in his review and wrote: \\"The ideas at the heart of Warp are sound and, in general, the game is well paced and introduces its evolutions at just the right time. There's a looseness to the execution though, and it keeps the experience from becoming more than the sum of its parts. Warp is a pleasant enough diversion, but with patchwork design that remixes gameplay ideas and stylistic elements from sources as diverse as Splosion Man, Metal Gear Solid and Portal, it never gels into anything particularly memorable.\\" References External links * Warp EA Website 2012 video games Electronic Arts games PlayStation 3 games PlayStation Network games Puzzle video games Stealth video games Unreal Engine games Video games developed in Canada Windows games Xbox 360 Live Arcade games ","title":"Warp (2012 video game)"},{"id":"31196166","text":"Vitaly Vulf Vitaly Yakovlevich Vulf (Russian: Вита́лий Я́ковлевич Вульф, 23 May 1930 – 13 March 2011)Скончался Виталий Вульф was a Russian art, drama, film critic, literary critic, translator, TV and radio broadcaster and critic.

Portugal has one 1MW research reactor located in the National Nuclear Research Centre at Sacavém, which is in permanent shutdown state. Further nuclear energy activities are not planned in the near future. Other nuclear activities include medical applications such as radiology, radiotherapy and nuclear medicine, as well as use of industrial radioactive sources. In 1971, Portugal planned to build an 8,000 MW nuclear power plant to be completed by 2000. Plans were delayed until 1995 when it was decided to not proceed with the project. In 2004, the Government of Portugal rejected a proposal to reconsider its decision. After the Carnation Revolution, a military coup in April 1974 which overthrew the Estado Novo regime, projects for the construction of nuclear power plants have since been postponed or dismissed by the government.Lorenzo Cimarossa, Model for Evaluation of Nuclear Energy Costs in Portugal, Instituto Superior Técnico - Technical University of Lisbon (December 2010); pg.12 2.5.2 History of Nuclear Energy in Portugal Presently Portugal has no spent fuel. In September 2007, the core of the Portuguese Research Reactor (RPI) was converted from high enriched to low enriched fuel, all enriched uranium as well as all spent fuel has been shipped to the United States in the framework of the “United States Foreign Research Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel Acceptance Program”. Liquid effluents produced in the RPI, as well as effluents of medical applications are stored locally, and later discharged in accordance with national law. Solid radioactive waste and discarded sealed sources are centrally stored in the national intermediate radioactive waste storage. History =1948 to 1954= Portugal first began developing nuclear energy in 1948, when the Instituto para a Alta Cultura (Superior Culture Institute) proposed the creation of a commission of geologists and physicists to study uranium supplies and mining technologies to the Ministry for National Education. The project was declined. At the same time, the 2nd National Engineering Meeting suggested the meeting participants to propose a general plan for the future utilization of atomic energy in Portugal. The first approved proposal arrived in 1952, after an early rejection in 1950, when the National Education Ministry presented an item for the National General Budget to specifically finance studies related to the development of nuclear energy in the country. During October 1952, the temporary Commission for Nuclear Energy Studies was created and formed a partnership with the Portuguese universities, becoming the first centers for nuclear energy research in Portugal, both pure and applied. In March 1954 the Nuclear Energy Board (Junta de Energia Nuclear, or JEN) was created; its role consisted initially in an inspection of the current situation of uranium supplies both in Portugal and its overseas territories (particularly the vast mineral potential of both Angola and Mozambique in Africa). Later on, the JEN created the Laboratory for Nuclear Engineering and Physics (Laboratório de Física e Engenharia Nucleares, or LFEN), which was inaugurated in 1961 as the first Portuguese center for education and research for the benefit of both universities and industry. =1955 to 1969= In 1955 the first proposal for building a nuclear plant was made, professor Alberto Abecassis Manzanares, of the Instituto Superior Técnico, stated the importance of building an experimental low power reactor (between 5000 and 10000 kW), which would serve to gather enough experience for handling higher power reactors. In 1957, at the 2nd Portuguese Industry Meeting, Armando Gilbert presented a communication in which he underlined the importance of beginning to use nuclear energy, starting from 1965. Later on, in the first Meeting of Portuguese Technicians for Nuclear Energy, this deadline was extended by about 10 years. The first concrete step was taken in April 1958, when the Portuguese Association of Nuclear Companies (Companhia Portuguesa de Indústrias Nucleares, or CPIN) was created. CPIN was a joint venture of several companies, including the Portuguese conglomerate Companhia União Fabril (CUF). CPIN, in 1959, began to intensify the studies and to train engineers for the installation of a first pilot nuclear plant, with approximate power of 50 MWe, to be completed by 1965. Three years later it presented the preliminary studies for a 230 MWe nuclear plant equipped with a boiling water reactor. In 1964 CPIN sold its assets to the Portuguese thermo-electric company (Empresa Termoeléctrica Portuguesa, or ETP), which one year later presented a joint project with Electricity Company of Sevilla (Spain) for a nuclear plant close to the Guadiana River. In 1969, ETP presented preliminary studies regarding the choice of a site for the first Portuguese nuclear plant. From the six originally proposed locations, the final choice was between Ferrel and Sizandro. A nuclear plant was to be made operational by the end of the 1970s in Sizandro. =1970 to 1979= In 1972 the Portuguese electrical company Companhia Portuguesa de Electricidade (CPE) foresees 1979 as the year in which the first Portuguese reactor would start its activity. The plan was to build four reactors at different times between 1981 and 1989, with an investment of about 30 million contos, at 1972 prices (about 350 million euros at 2010 prices). In 1974 CPE contracted a consulting firm to evaluate the best site for the installation of the first Portuguese nuclear power plant. Ferrel, near Peniche, was chosen as the best option. In April 1974 the Estado Novo, the authoritarian right-leaning regime of Portugal, was overthrown due to a leftist military coup. Another study was exposed in December 1977 to the secretary for energy and mines, which presented the possibility of building 4 to 7 4000 MWe nuclear reactors between 1990 and 2000. The government though decided to delay the decision. =1980 to 1986= The national energy plan in 1982 included the opening of a nuclear plant that generated 950 MWe power in 1995, which would lead to a nuclear program that would bring up to 9000 MWe of installed power by 2010. The VIII Constitutional Government did not approve this plan, but sent it to be discussed in a public debate. The following version of the National Energy Plan, in 1984, also planned the installation of 950 MWe reactors between 1998 and 2010, but the decision process stopped while doing location analysis because the International Atomic Energy Agency would not reach a formal position on the issue. The official halt to a possible nuclear energy plan came from the State Secretary of Environment of the X Constitutional Government in 1986. Although the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the State Secretary of Industry did not agree with this position, the then Prime Minister of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva rectified it, becoming an official government decision. =20-year hiatus= In the following 20 years, nuclear energy became a taboo for Portugal. The XIII Constitutional Government (1995–1999), led by António Guterres, decided to adopt an energy policy focused on renewable energies. At the end of that parliamentary term, the government emitted the joint order number 531/99, in which it formalized the position of Portugal on the nuclear energy issue at international level. The overal position is a gradual retirement from both the industry and the research and development scene in this field. These propositions are popular amongst the people, who 70% do not want nuclear plants built in their country. =2005 to present= It was only in February 2005 that nuclear was brought once again to attention when the businessman Patrick Monteiro de Barros, together with other promoters, proposed the construction of a 1600 MWe EPR reactor. The possible location for that plant was not revealed, although rumours stated that Mogadouro, close to the Douro river could be the one. The project never reached a debate stage. The strong opposition from the environmentalist organisations and companies involved in the renewable energy business forbid not only the further development of Monteiro de Barros project, but of the nuclear option in any form.Correia et al. 2009.

The VVER-440 Model V213 was a product of the first uniform safety requirements drawn up by the Soviet designers. This model includes added emergency core cooling and auxiliary feedwater systems as well as upgraded accident localization systems.http://www.atomeromu.hu/hu/Rolunk/Lapok/default.aspx Originally, these plants had expected lives of 30 years; however, the Hungarian government decided to complete 20-year life extension projects on the reactors. The cost of these projects will amount to approximately $900 million but will also increase total capacity to 2,000 MWe. Hungary also had plans to build two more reactors with capacities of 950 MWe each but cancelled the plans due to decreased power demand in the early 1990s.\\"Nuclear Power in Hungary\\" World Nuclear Association.

Spent fuel normally is disposed without reprocessing, though there are instances of spent fuel sent to Russia for reprocessing. For the spent fuel that is not reprocessed, it is kept at the nuclear reactor site for five years in pools and then sent to dry storage. Additionally, in 2005 the residents of Bátaapáti , in South Hungary, approved construction plans for low and intermediate-level waste storage facility. Parliament approved this construction in November 2005. The costs of this construction will be covered by the Central Nuclear Financial Fund, the fund the nuclear power companies pay into. In December 2012, the storage facility started operation by receiving its first batch of nuclear waste. The construction costs were 68 billion forint (approx. $310 million).\\"Hungarian repository receives first waste\\" World Nuclear News.

It is a tower defense game that eschews the traditional top-down view of similar games, instead using a third- person action-oriented viewpoint. After being demonstrated at Penny Arcade Expo East 2011, the game was released via Xbox Live Arcade on October 5, 2011, and for Windows PCs on October 12, 2011. Gameplay Placing defenses in the game Orcs Must Die! is a variant of a tower defense game; the player as the War Mage must defend one or more Rifts on each level from an onslaught of orcs and other creatures that emerge from one or more entrances and traverse the level. Generally, each orc that reaches a Rift deducts a point from the starting Rift Score while specialized orcs may take off more points; if the Rift Score drops to zero, the level is lost and the player will have to start again. The orc armies arrive in increasingly more difficult waves, with each level having between four and twelve waves. In general, waves will begin a few seconds after the player defeats the prior one, but roughly every three waves on all bar Nightmare difficulty, the player is given a break where they can set up traps and initiate the next wave when they are ready. As the War Mage, the player has the ability to place numerous traps and arm themselves with weapons and equipment to defeat the orcs. The player selects a number of traps and equipment (up to ten) from their current Spellbook; once the player starts placing traps they will be bound to this selection. Traps can be placed on any appropriate surface, but each trap costs in-game currency to place, and traps will have variable costs based on their effectiveness. Traps typically work once and then have a reset period before they will activate again. Such traps include floor, wall, and ceiling traps, and several Guardians that will act on their own accord. The player is given an amount of money to spend on trap placement at the start, and earns more by defeating the orcs and after completing waves; money can also be dropped by certain monsters that must be collected by the player. Traps can be placed at any time, including in combat, and between waves, placed traps can be removed and refunded for their cost. Later, the player gains access to Weavers, who for various costs can boost certain effects on the player or traps placed in the manner of a technology tree; these effects only last for that level. Once the player initiates a wave, they can run about the level to participate in combat or place additional traps. The player must watch their health and mana used for their weapons but orcs may drop health and mana potions that will replenish these; alternatively the player can heal while in proximity of the Rift. If the player should lose all their health or fall off the level, they will respawn back at the Rift but this will cost them a number of Rift Points. After defeating the last wave, the player is awarded a number of skulls, up to 5 (or on Apprentice difficulty, limited to two), based on their score (reflecting how many Rift points remain) and the time needed to defeat all the waves. Skulls are used to buy improvements to traps and weapons in the player's spellbook, such as increasing damage, reducing cost, or making them more effective against the orcs. The player, after completing each level the first time, is also rewarded with a new trap type for their Spellbook they can use in subsequent levels. These improvements remain with the player, so that they may return to earlier levels with these improved traps to earn more skulls. Plot The story revolves around the Order, an elite faction of wizards and warriors who guard the Rifts, magical openings between the human world and the 'Dead World', which provide a source of magical power throughout both worlds. Using this power, the Order is able to maintain a perfect world for humanity by using magic to manipulate nature. In order to protect the human world, they have constructed magic-powered fortresses throughout the Dead World to guard the Rifts, particularly from the adversarial faction known as 'the Mob' - a brutish horde of creatures such as Orcs, Ogres and Gnolls which, despite being unintelligent, would otherwise pose a major threat to the human world due to their vast numbers. After a surprise attack by the Mob, the player character, known only as the Hero (voiced by Rob McCollum), finds himself as the last living member of the Order, as the Mob appears to have suddenly obtained a surge in both strength and intelligence. Taking it upon himself to defend the human world, he defends the fortresses from the Mob one by one (much to the bewilderment of his teacher, who narrates the storyline). The Hero eventually learns that the Mob has been empowered by the Sorceress (voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard), a past student of the Order who, despite showing overwhelming potential to help defend humanity, instead chose to seek power for herself and used magic to seize control of the Mob. As the Mob's attacks become more and more aggressive, the Hero eventually chooses to ensure the safety of the human world by stepping back through a Rift and closing them all forever by means of a simple spell. Although this means that the Mob can never reach the human world, it also means that humanity is no longer able to use magic to sustain itself, and the whole world, which has become dependent on magic, begins to deteriorate. In the Dead World, the Sorceress is rendered powerless as the Rifts can no longer provide her with magic, and she is left at the mercy of the Mob, who have been reduced to their original state. Development and release Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Joystiq called the Xbox 360 version a \\"finely-tuned whirling chamber of death\\". IGN praised the length of the campaign as well as the combat system. It sold over 50,000 units on Xbox and substantially more on PC. Sequels Orcs Must Die! 2 was announced by Robot Entertainment on April 2, 2012 and released on July 30, 2012. The sequel includes two-player co-op with the introduction of the Sorceress in a playable role. Orcs Must Die! Unchained, the third game in the series, initially released as a beta version in 2014, was released on April 18, 2017 for the Windows platform, while the PlayStation 4 version was released on July 18, 2017. It was released under a free-to-play model. Orcs Must Die! 3 was announced during a Stadia connect on August 19, 2019. It released on Stadia with single-player and two-player co-op on July 14, 2020 as a timed exclusive. Robot Entertainment has not yet announced when it will launch on other platforms.

Electricity consumption in Belgium has increased slowly since 1990 and in 2016 nuclear power provided 51.3%, 41 TWh per year, of the country's electricity. The country's first commercial nuclear power plant began operating in 1974. Belgium decided to phase out nuclear power generation completely by 2025. Although intermediate deadlines have been missed or pushed back, on 30 March 2018 the Council of Ministers confirmed the 2025 phase-out date. History Belgium has a long industrial history in the nuclear sector. Biraco in Olen, which regularly hosted Marie and Pierre Curie, was at the start of the industrial production of radium in 1922. Open cut mine Shinkolobwe by Jadotville (today Likasi) in 1920s, men with wheelbarrows pushing ore while an overseer looks on (\\"Chalux\\" 1925) The uranium ore used was discovered in 1913 in Katanga in then Belgian Congo by Union Minière du Haut-Katanga. The ore found in the Shinkolobwe mine was exceptionally rich. Even before World War II the United States expressed interest, however it wasn't until 1942 when the United States required uranium for the Manhattan Project, and Belgium was one of the few countries with an appreciable stock of uranium ore, that Edgar Sengier struck a deal. For the following decade Belgium, through its colony, was one of the main suppliers of uranium to the United States. This trade relationship resulted in Belgium being granted access to nuclear technology for civil purposes. In 1952 this led to establishing SCK•CEN, a study center for nuclear research in Mol. The first reactor BR1 (Belgian Reactor 1) became critical in 1956. Construction of BR2 started the following year. The BR2 reactor is one of the five main reactors producing molybdenum-99 that decays to technetium-99m, the radioisotope used in more than 80% of diagnostic imaging procedures in nuclear medicine.http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC54/GC54InfDocuments/English/gc54inf-3-att7_en.pdf In 1954 Belgium was one of the founding members of Cern, and three years later it was one of the original signatories of the Euratom Treaty. In 1957 a site in Dessel, near SCK•CEN, was chosen as the location for Eurochemic. Thirteen OECD countries (Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Norway, Turkey, Portugal, Spain) joined forces to build a pilot nuclear reprocessing installation. The atoomwijk, a housing project for workers on private land near the site, was a scientific village unique in Europe at the time. The Atomium in Brussels In 1958 the Brussels World's Fair Expo 58 was to be powered by BR3. The reactor was to be built in Brussels, and open to visitors. Ultimately safety concerns and administrative problems moved the reactor to the SCK•CEN site. The other iconic symbol of the interest in nuclear technology at the time, the Atomium, housed a photo exhibition. In 1959, the Trico Center was established in Kinshasa. Its TRICO I research reactor was the first nuclear reactor on the African continent. The US-built BR3 was connected to the grid in 1962, making it the first pressurized water reactor in Western Europe. SCK•CEN played a key role in developing MOX fuel. In 1960, near the same site, NV Belgonuclaire, a joint venture between SCK•CEN, Electrabel and Tractebel received its first plutonium from the United States, with the goal of industrially producing MOX fuel. In 1963 BR3 was loaded with MOX fuel and was the first reactor in the world to generate electricity this way. In 1967 the commercial Chooz-A plant in France, close to the Belgian border, was connected to the grid. It had been constructed by a French-Belgian joint venture Sena (Société d'énergie nucléaire Franco-belge des Ardennes) to house a French-Belgian prototype pressurized water reactor, the first one built in Western Europe. It was jointly operated and delivered electricity to both countries. In 1972 Belgium participated with The Netherlands and Germany in the failed SNR-300 fast breeder reactor. In 1973 Belgium and four other European countries formed Eurodif. The first commercial nuclear power plant in Belgium, Doel 1, came into service in 1974. Six more rectors were connected to the grid during the following ten years. Plans for an eighth reactor were scrapped, instead utilities Electrabel and SPE took a 25% participation in the French Chooz-B nuclear power plant. In 1974 Eurochemics ceased reprocessing. In 1987 BR3 was the first pressurized water reactor to be shut down in Europe. Decommissioning BR3 and Eurochemic has given Belgium significant expertise in the decommissioning of nuclear sites. Currently Belgium is preparing to contribute to Generation IV reactor research through the MYRRHA project. Nuclear power plants Doel Nuclear Power Station near Antwerp There are two commercial nuclear power plants operational with seven reactors: * Doel Nuclear Power Station on the Scheldt river, near the port of Antwerp, and * Tihange Nuclear Power Station on the Meuse river. Both stations are operated by Electrabel. Dessel is home to two sites for the production of nuclear fuel. One operated by FBFC, the other is being decommissioned and belonged to the Belgonucleaire company . There are several test reactors at the SCK•CEN site in Mol. The Thetis research reactor of Ghent University is being decommissioned, and has had its fuel removed from site. None of these research reactors supply electricity to the grid. The French nuclear power plant in Chooz is from the Belgian border and surrounded on three sides by Belgian territory. The area around the power plant is subject to the same precautions as if there was a Belgian nuclear installation in the center. Waste =Past= Belgium is one of the thirteen countries who have dumped radioactive waste in the ocean. This practise was permanently halted in 1982. Prior to parliament placing a moratorium on nuclear reprocessing in 1993,Parliamentary proceedings in 1999. Specifically the amendment of December 22nd. 670 tonnes of spent fuel from the commercial reactors was processed in La Hague, France. The last return transport of highly radioactive waste, mainly fission products, took place in 2007. Other types of waste will be returning from La Hague to Belgium until 2019. Spent fuel from the BR2 reactor at SCK•CEN was reprocessed in Dounreay, Scotland. = Current situation = A national agency is responsible for radioactive waste management(ONDRAF/NIRAS), including transport, treatment, conditioning, storage, and disposal. The main disposal facility is the Belgoprocess (subsidiary of ONDRAF/NIRAS) site close to the towns of Mol and Dessel, which stores short-lived intermediate-level waste and high-level waste. Several shipments of reprocessed Belgian spent fuel, from France and Scotland, have also arrived at the Mol-Dessel site. This site offers interim storage on the surface. Synatom, the Electrabel subsidiary that manages the fuel cycle for the commercial power plants, stores spent nuclear fuel on site before it is transferred over to ONDRAF/NIRAS. The commercial reactors produce 120 tonnes of highly radioactive spent fuel annually. In Doel it is stored dry in containers, in Tihange a spent fuel pool is used. = Long-term plans = For low and intermediate-level waste with a short half-life (less than 30 years) the cAt project was chosen in 2006. This entails encasing the waste in modular concrete boxes which will be stacked inside structures resembling tumuli in Dessel. The site is to be actively monitored for 300 years, after which the radioactivity of the waste will have decreased by a factor 1,000. A test version was built in 2011, and the project is awaiting final licensing. ONDRAF/NIRAS and SCK•CEN run the HADES underground laboratory through EIG EURIDICE (European Underground Research Infrastructure for Disposal of nuclear waste In Clay Environment). Since 1980 this laboratory is researching if layers of clay as found in the North-East of Belgium could be used for permanent storage of nuclear waste. In September 2011 ONDRAF/NIRAS fulfilled its legal obligation of publishing a Waste Plan. The 255 page document evaluates all proposed methods of disposal and concludes by recommending storage in the aforementioned layers of clay. The final decision is a political one. No permanent storing is expected to take place prior to 2040. In August 2018, newspaper Le Soir revealed ONDRAF/NIRAS estimates that the option of long-term deep-burying high-level radioactive waste would not cost €3.2 billion, but rather €8 to €10 billion. This is because it is now considered more adequate to bury the waste at a depth of 400 metres instead of the previously determined 200 metres. Legally, the nuclear plants' private owners, mainly Electrabel, are set to pay for this through the Synatom-managed phase-out fund. = Effluent = Nuclear power stations also produce liquid and gaseous effluent. Nuclear effluent contains less radioactivity over a larger volume and is dispersed into the environment. The Federal Agency for Nuclear Control (FANC) estimates the maximum impact of the Doel site at 0.02 mSv per year, and the maximum impact of the Tihange site at 0.05 mSv per year. The legal limit of exposure of the public to radiation from artificial sources is 1 mSv per year. By comparison, the exposure to radiation during one transatlantic flight is 0.08 mSv and a CT scan of the chest is about 6.6 mSv (per scan and not per year, as those are cumulative). The liquid effluent from the Doel and Tihange sites are discharged into the Scheldt and Meuse rivers. There is no river near the Mol-Dessel sites. Its effluent is discharged via a pipeline into the small river Molse Nete. Which suffers from historical pollution. Phase-out In 1999 the policy statement of the Verhofstadt I Government (a coalition including the green parties Groen! and Ecolo) introduced a plan to phase-out nuclear power generation. The following year a government appointed commission reported that nuclear power was important to Belgium and recommended further development. Nevertheless, in 2003 near the end of its term Belgium's government passed phase-out legislation.31 JANUARI 2003. - Wet houdende de geleidelijke uitstap uit kernenergie voor industriële elektriciteitsproductie. It stipulates that no new commercial reactors are to be built and that Belgium's seven reactors would be shut down when they reach an operational lifetime of 40 years. All reactors reach this age in the period 2015–2025. When the law was being passed, there was speculation it would be overturned again as soon as an administration without the green parties was in power. A report published in 2005 by the Federal Planning Bureau noted that in many parts of Belgium nuclear power makes up more than 50% of the electricity generated.. The breakdown of electricity generation methods is given in Figure 7 on page 13. It would therefore be difficult for Belgium to adhere to the emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocols without nuclear power. In 2007, the Belgian Commission on Energy said that the use of nuclear energy is imperative to meet requirements and maintain economic stability. Furthermore, the commission believed that energy prices would double without the use of nuclear energy. The commission finally recommended that the operating lives of the seven nuclear power plants should be extended. The International Energy Agency stated in 2011 that the Belgian government should reconsider the nuclear phase-out policy. In 2009, based on the GEMIX report, the government decided to extend the lifetimes of the three oldest nuclear power plants until 2025. In exchange, the owners would be charged an extra €215–245 million (about US$340 million) per year. This was not yet finalized into law when in 2010 the government resigned over unrelated issues. It was considered to be a formality, that would be taken care of when a new government was formed. However a prolonged period of political instability, without a government being formed, followed. The decision was pushed back further after the Fukushima nuclear disaster happened in March 2011. The caretaker government then decided to postpone any debate or decision in the matter until after the results of a European stress-test of the facilities were known. A couple of months prior to these results being published however the new government decided in July 2012 that only Tihange 1's lifetime would be extended to 2025. The two oldest units at the Doel site (Doel 1 and Doel 2) were set to be closed in 2015. Their lifetime was however extended until 2025. The remaining Belgian nuclear power plants Doel 3 is set to be closed down in 2022, Tihange 2 in 2023 and Doel 4 and Tihange 3 in 2025. Although intermediate deadlines have been missed or pushed back, on 30 March 2018 the Council of Ministers confirmed the 2025 phase-out date and stated draft legislation would be brought forward later in the year. The cost of the phase-out, excluding waste management, is estimated in 2018 at €15.1 billion. As of 2018, Synatom has more than €10 billion in the phase-out fund, which includes the liabilities for waste management. Synatom may legally lend back three quarters of the fund's contents to its mother company Electrabel. Hydrogen damage in Doel 3 and Tihange 2 Mid August 2012 it was revealed that planned inspections, carried out in June, using a new type of ultrasound technique had detected thousands of quasi-laminar flaws in the forged rings of Doel 3's reactor vessel. The Doel 3 and Tihange 2 reactors vessels were both built in the early 1980s by RDM. Subsequently Tihange 2 was also inspected with this new technique at the next planned inspection. Tihange 2 reactor vessel was found to be affected in a similar fashion. During further inspections and reports from expert panels the reactors remained non-operational. Shortly after FANC had communicated the news, the government responded angrily. Suggesting they might politicize the agency and stating the director general should have kept quiet until all reports were in. Three months later he was replaced by Jan Bens, a former director of the commercial nuclear powerplant Doel. Jan Bens' neutrality was questioned by FANC's own experts Pierre Kockerols and Yvan Pouleur. The latter, director of internal affairs, also filed a complaint at the council of state. December 5 Electrabel, operator of the reactors in question, presented results of its investigation. It stated that the reactors could be restarted safely. The report was studied by AIB Vinçotte, BEL V, a panel of international experts and by a group of Belgian Professors. In May Kristof Calvo published the confidential reports of BEL V, and AIB Vinçotte. Both reports, compiled at the end of January, speak of uncertainties. Concerns are also raised due to the break exclusion requirement, and the fact that this level of fractures was unseen. rapports: BEL V AIB Vinçotte At the request of the European Greens, materials expert and nuclear consultant Ilse Tweer, had also published her own report in which she argued against restarting the reactors. Jan Bens stated to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in March that the flaws were hydrogen flakes. He went on to claim that they had been there since construction and did not deteriorate. FANC postponed its decision several times, requesting more tests and information. May 17 FANC announced that it will allow the reactors to be restarted. Doel 3 was restarted June 3, 2013 after nearly a year of inactivity. Thiange 2 followed a couple days later. However, in March 2014 both reactors were taken out of service again, after the long-term tests agreed in June 2013 did not result in \\"the desired outcome\\". At the end of 2015 it was announced that they would reopen. Anti- nuclear movement On the 2012 anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Belgian group Nucléaire Stop Kernenergie organized an event in Brussels calling for an end to the use of nuclear power and the shutting down of Belgium’s nuclear facilities. Protesters insisted that nuclear power is unsafe. Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann expects anti-nuclear petition drives to start in at least six European Union countries in 2012 with the goal of having the EU abandon nuclear power. Under the EU's Lisbon Treaty, petitions that attract at least one million signatures can seek legislative proposals from the European Commission. In 2011 an industry-commissioned poll found that while a majority of Belgians supported the decision to phase out nuclear power. In 2012 70% feared higher energy costs and 82% believed nuclear power should not be phased out if it threatened energy security. It was found that 65% of the population supported continued nuclear power generation in the country. In the Flemish part of Belgium polls showed that only 16% of those questioned advocated an end to nuclear power generation. In January 2013 an international protest against the Tihange power plant was organized by GreenLeft in Maastricht with about 1,500 participants from the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium.

The story is a sequel to Moore's previous story Alan Moore's The Courtyard and part of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Moore later continued the sequence with his comic Providence. In March 2012 it became the first recipient of the newly created \\"Graphic Novel\\" category at the Bram Stoker Awards. Plot FBI agents Lamper and Brears visit Aldo Sax at a psychiatric hospital, where he has been detained since committing two murders. They are investigating a copycat killer, and want to question Sax about his motives. Sax speaks seemingly unintelligible gibberish. After studying Sax's previous investigation, Lamper and Brears decide to track down drug dealer Johnny Carcosa in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Carcosa escapes into a mural in the courtyard of his apartment building. The agents track Carcosa's disturbing sex paraphernalia to a specialty shop in Salem, Massachusetts. Going undercover as husband and wife, Lamper and Brears attend an orgy hosted by the owners of the shop, members of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, who regularly indulge in sex rituals to attract the sexual attention of a race of fishmen. Lamper and Brears are exposed as agents and Lamper is killed by the cultists. Brears is locked in a room with a fishman, which rapes her continuously for several days. During this ordeal Brears has a vision of Carcosa, who reveals himself as an avatar of Nyarlathotep, one of the Great Old Ones. The creature tastes a drop of Brears' urine and determines that she is pregnant. It helps her escape through underwater tunnels into the ocean. Brears returns to the city and contacts the FBI, instructing them to raid the specialty shop. They find that the cultists have been killed by the fishman, which is gunned down by the agents. Three months later, Brears visits Sax and is able to understand his gibberish as Aklo, the language of the fishmen, based on R'lyehian the language of Yuggoth from Lovecraft's stories. She tells him that she is pregnant with the child of the fishman. She realizes that the events in Lovecraft's fiction are actually premonitions of a future apocalypse that will be heralded by the birth of her child, Cthulhu. Publication history Moore talked about the genesis of the project in an interview with Wired magazine: \\"It was just at the time when I finally parted company with DC Comics over something dreadful that happened around the Watchmen film [...] I had a tax bill coming up, and I needed some money quickly. So I happened to be talking to William [A. Christensen] from Avatar Press, and he suggested that he could provide some if I was up for doing a four-part series, so I did. So although I took it to pay off the tax bill, I’m always going to make sure I try and make it the best possible story I can.\\" Moore wanted to elaborate on some of the ideas presented in The Courtyard while at the same time telling a modern story that did not rely upon a 1930s atmosphere. Another idea was to use some of the elements he felt Lovecraft himself and pastiche writers censored or left out of the stories, such as the racism and sexual phobias. Moore explains: \\"Lovecraft was sexually squeamish; would only talk of ‘certain nameless rituals.’ Or he'd use some euphemism: ‘blasphemous rites.’ It was pretty obvious, given that a lot of his stories detailed the inhuman offspring of these ‘blasphemous rituals’ that sex was probably involved somewhere along the line. But that never used to feature in Lovecraft's stories, except as a kind of suggested undercurrent. So I thought, let's put all of the unpleasant racial stuff back in, let's put sex back in. Let's come up with some genuinely ‘nameless rituals’: let's give them a name.\\" =Collected editions= The series was collected into a single volume, available in both hardcover and softcover.

The novel concerns itself with a young woman who has accepted one of two suitors, then discovered that he was unworthy of her love. It was the first novel published in the Fortnightly Review. Plot summary Clara Amedroz is the only surviving child of the elderly squire of Belton Castle in Somersetshire. At twenty-five, she is old for an unmarried woman. Her father's income and savings have been dissipated to pay for the extravagances of her brother, who subsequently committed suicide. Since her father has no living sons, his estate, which is entailed, will pass upon his death to a distant cousin, Will Belton. Despite her poor prospects, she has two eligible suitors. Within four days of making her acquaintance, Will Belton proposes marriage to her. Belton is warm-hearted, kind, and generous, and these qualities make a strong impression on Clara. However, she believes herself in love with Captain Frederic Aylmer, although he has given no clear signs of feeling that way toward her. Aylmer is impeccable in his manners, smooth, urbane, well-read, and a member of Parliament; compared to him, Belton is awkward and unpolished. Clara rejects Belton's offer, urging him to regard her as a sister. Not long thereafter, Aylmer proposes to her, and she eagerly accepts. However, her happiness is short-lived. Her new fiancé proves shallow and cold, more concerned with his own comfort than with her happiness. Moreover, he expects her to subject herself to his domineering mother. Mr. Amedroz dies; and although Belton offers to allow Clara to remain at Belton Castle, she goes to live with the Aylmer family in Yorkshire. Lady Aylmer, who wants her son to marry money or a title, exerts herself to make Clara miserable there; and Captain Aylmer offers no support to his betrothed. For Clara, the final straw comes when Lady Aylmer demands that she sever her ties with a friend. Mrs. Askerton, Lady Aylmer has learned, left an abusive drunken husband in India and lived with Colonel Askerton for several years before the death of her husband freed her to marry him. Clara is duly appalled by her friend's past immorality, but cannot bring herself to cast off someone who has come to depend on her friendship. Pressed relentlessly on the subject by Lady Aylmer, she declares an end to her engagement and returns to Somersetshire, where she accepts the hospitality of the Askertons. Will Belton has never ceased to show his love for Clara, and she realises that he is worthy of her love. However, she believes that it would be wrong to transfer her affection from one man to another. Only after Mrs. Askerton and Will's sister Mary Belton persuade her that it would be unjust to withhold her affection from Will can she bring herself to put aside her scruples and accept him. Marital bliss ensues. Major themes The Belton Estate was written shortly after Can You Forgive Her?, and the two novels have a principal theme in common: a woman trying to decide between two suitors, neither ineligible but differing greatly in their desirable and undesirable qualities. A theme in this novel, not uncommon among other Victorian authors but unusual in Trollope's work, is what John Halperin calls \\"mediated desire\\": the desirability of a thing increasing with the difficulty of obtaining it. When Captain Aylmer proposes to Clara, she responds with an enthusiastic affirmative; and this leads him to question the value of his acquisition: > What is there that any man desires,—any man or any woman,—that does not lose > half its value when it is found to be easy of access and easy of possession? > Wine is valued by its price, not its flavour. Open your doors freely to > Jones and Smith, and Jones and Smith will not care to enter them. Shut your > doors obdurately against the same gentlemen, and they will use all their > little diplomacy to effect an entrance. Captain Aylmer, when he heard the > hearty tone of the girl’s answer, already began almost to doubt whether it > was wise on his part to devote the innermost bin of his cellar to wine that > was so cheap. Publication history In 1865, Trollope, George Henry Lewes, and others founded the Fortnightly Review. Somewhat against Trollope's judgement, it was decided that the new magazine was always to contain a novel. Trollope, called upon to produce the first novel, wrote The Belton Estate between 30 January and 4 September 1865; it was serialised in the Fortnightly beginning with its first issue on 15 May 1865, and running through 1 January 1866. The novel was published in book form by Chapman & Hall in December 1865, with a date of 1866 on the title page. Against Trollope's wishes, it was released in three volumes rather than the two that he had intended. In his Autobiography, Trollope reported receiving a total of £1757 for The Belton Estate. Of this sum £800 came from the Fortnightly, and another £700 from Chapman & Hall for the first 2,000 copies. In 1865–66, the novel was serialised in the American Littell's Living Age. It was published in book form in 1866 by Lippincott of Philadelphia, by Harper in New York, and by Tauchnitz in Leipzig. In 1867, it was serialised in French in the Revue Nationale as L'Heritage des Belton, and a Dutch translation, Het Huis Belton, was published in two volumes by Brast of Dordrecht. In 1871, a Russian translation was issued in St. Petersburg under the title Beltonskoy Pomesti; in 1875, Hachette of Paris released a new French translation as La Domaine de Belton. More recently, an edition with an introduction by John Halperin was published in 1923; it was re-released in paperback by Oxford University Press in 1986. In 1991, the Trollope Society released an edition with an introduction by David Skilton. Reception Trollope himself was apparently unimpressed by his work on the novel. In his 1883 autobiography, he wrote: \\"It is readable, and contains scenes which are true to life; but it has no peculiar merits, and will add nothing to my reputation as a novelist.\\" Contemporary critics responded negatively to the work. Reviews in the Athenaeum, the Spectator, and the Saturday Review all expressed disappointment. Henry James was particularly scathing, describing the novel as \\"a work written for children; a work prepared for minds unable to think\\". The Belton Estate has received little critical attention in more recent years. Halperin describes it as \\"one of [Trollope's] most undervalued novels\\"; he suggests that this is because it was published at a time when Trollope was quickly putting out some of his finest works: \\"it got, almost literally, lost.\\" References Trollope, Anthony.

The first recorded laws dealing with prostitution were in Nova Scotia in 1759, although as early as August 19, 1675 the Sovereign Council of New France convicted Catherine Guichelin, one of the King's Daughters, with leading a \\"life scandalous and dishonest to the public\\", declared her a prostitute and banished her from the walls of Quebec City under threat of the whip. Following Canadian Confederation, the laws were consolidated in the Criminal Code. These dealt principally with pimping, procuring, operating brothels and soliciting. Most amendments to date have dealt with the latter, originally classified as a vagrancy offence, this was amended to soliciting in 1972, and communicating in 1985. Since the Charter of Rights and Freedoms became law, the constitutionality of Canada's prostitution laws have been challenged on a number of occasions. Until the Second World War Canada originally inherited many of its criminal laws from England. The first legislation dealing with prostitution in Canada was a Nova Scotia Act of 1759 which allowed imprisonment for \\"lewd behaviour\\". Most prostitution in the early days of Canadian history took place in brothels which were in every city. Action by the authorities occurred only in the context of other criminal or socially undesirable activity taking place in or in the vicinity of these brothels such as creating a public nuisance. As in many other countries, what control there was of prostitution existed under vagrancy laws designed to keep public places free of \\"undesirables\\". Owners or operators of brothels (bawdy houses) could also be prosecuted as vagrants. These were based on the British Vagrancy Act 1824. Once the federal government came into being following Confederation in 1867, it became possible to develop common criminal laws for all of Canada. Women under 21 were protected from 'defilement' from that date, while in 1869, vagrancy provisions were consolidated and extended to include males 'living on the avails' of prostitution. The penalties were increased in 1874, and bawdy houses regulated from 1886. By a lack of suitable alternatives, women were annexed into the sex industry. Only from about 1890 was there concern about the actual existence of prostitution, with religious groups, early feminists and women's groups such as Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and the National Council of Women of Canada campaigning for social purity and against prostitution, which was condemned as a 'social evil', and 'white slave trade', a popular concern of the time. This produced an enthusiasm for rescuing 'fallen women'. However, with increasing action against brothels, more and more people working in prostitution carried out their business on the streets. The federal Parliament enacted the first Criminal Code in 1892. Existing provisions were included and refined in the new Code, including making it an offence to procure women 'for unlawful carnal connection'. The laws continued to be amended in various ways over the years. From 1892 to 1972, this created an offence under 175(1)(c) for > a vagrant who: being a common prostitute or nightwalker is found in a public > place and does not, when required, give a good account of herself. Up to the 1880s prostitution was largely tolerated in the Prairie provinces. Before 1909 there were few arrests and even fewer fines for prostitution, in part because those caught were encouraged to leave town rather than be jailed. As the population became more settled, however, public opinion regarding this resource for itinerant men turned hostile. For example, a smallpox epidemic in the red light districts of Calgary ignited a crackdown as demanded by middle- class women reformers. Local chapters of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union vigorously opposed both saloons and prostitution, and called for woman suffrage as a tool to end those evils.Judy Bedford, \\"Prostitution In Calgary 1905-1914\\". Alberta History 1981 29(2): 1-11; Nancy M. Sheehan, \\"The WCTU on the Prairies, 1886-1930: An Alberta-Saskatchewan Comparison.\\" Prairie Forum (1981) 6#1 pp 17-33. Postwar The social purity movement became much less prominent after World War I but had little effect on the extent of prostitution, but there was now less public concern. Throughout enforcement was heavily gendered, with only a few men prosecuted under the avails and procurement laws. In 1947, it became an offence to transport a woman to a bawdy house. =Vagrancy= The original 1892 Criminal Code described 12 ways in which a \\"loose, idle or disorderly person or vagrant\\" might be arrested and upon conviction subjected to a maximum fine of $50 or imprisonment not exceeding six months with or without hard labour. This was directed at the person as \\"vagrant\\" (status law). In 1954, amendments made vagrancy the doing of a prohibited act, and these were reduced to five. Three of them dealt with street disorder and were nicknamed Vag A, B and C after the respective clauses, and thus the prostitution prohibition as Vag C or vagrancy (c). The original vagrancy laws were discriminatory in that they were applied overwhelmingly to women and criminalised the status of \\"being a common prostitute\\" rather than criminalising the behaviours associated with prostitution. For these reasons, the original status offences for prostitution could be said to contravene the current Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Both the judiciary and the 1970 Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women complained about this. In 1972 section 164.1: > No Apparent Means of Support > Every one commits vagrancy who: > (a) -not having any apparent means of support is found wandering abroad or > trespassing and does not, when required, justify his presence in the place > where he is found; > (b) -begs from door to door or in a public place; > (c) -being a common prostitute or night walker is found in a public place > and does not, when required, give a good account of herself was replaced by language prohibiting soliciting (communicating) for the purposes of prostitution (section 195.1), which read: > every person who solicits any person in a public place for the purpose of > prostitution is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. The new law was now gender neutral and defined an offence based on an act (although not the nature of the act) and was thought to have addressed the social nuisance concerns of residents. However it soon became clear that there were now new problems. In Hutt v. R. (1978) [SCC 82 D.L.R. (3d) 95] it was held that for the activities of a prostitute to be criminal their conduct must conform to the dictionary definition of \\"solicit\\"; it must be importuning, or \\"pressing or persistent\\" and constitute more than a mere indication that she was willing to prostitute herself. A plainclothes police officer permitted the appellant to enter his car. She then identified herself as a prostitute and discussed terms. The Court did not believe that this fell within the intent of parliament to prohibit acts \\"which would contribute to public inconvenience.\\" Four judges indicated that they would not have considered an automobile a \\"public place,\\" also excluding the actions from section 195.1. Following this there was concern that the police could no longer act against street prostitution unless there was \\"pressing or persistent\\" behaviour. =Municipal initiatives= Residents started to campaign against sex work as a public nuisance, primarily to have it shifted out of their neighbourhoods. The 1978 Hutt decision led to public pressure to amend section 195.1 to expand the definition of soliciting. Street prostitution was described as a \\" plague\\" and there was pressure to deal with activity that was claimed to blight residential and commercial areas, and to be associated with criminal activity, including drugs and exploitation of children. The federal government was seen to not be proactive on this prompting some cities to take action. Montreal (1980) and Calgary (1981) enacted bylaws that banned the use of streets and other public areas for prostitution. These cities claimed powers, derived from the provinces, to regulate the streets and restrict criminality. Although police and city officials claimed the bylaws to be effective, they were found to be unconstitutional. In Westendorp v R (1983) the Supreme Court found the Calgary by‑law was ultra vires. Similarly for Montreal (Goldwax et al. v. City of Montreal, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 525). These rulings therefore nullified other similar bylaws enacted or proposed in Vancouver, Niagara Falls, Regina and Halifax. However, a 1983 Montreal by‑law forbidding the selling of any services on city streets without a permit was upheld in Quebec Superior Court. Agitation for change continued at the municipal level as being most directly affected by the presence of prostitution. Ottawa and Edmonton created task forces in 1992 while Halifax, Montreal and Toronto police addressed juvenile prostitution and, in particular, exiting schemes. Ottawa Ottawa made 33 recommendations. Many of these focused on enforcement, while others addressed crime prevention, education and crisis intervention programs. Others supported the 1990 C49 report for a re-examination of the Fraser Report. Specifically, these addressed funding for research and more control of harassment or obstruction. The Ottawa report also asked the Minister to work with municipalities to establish a National Crime Prevention Council. In response, the City took action to deter automobile traffic in certain areas. Edmonton Edmonton focused on the juvenile issue, proposing amendments to child welfare legislation and the Criminal Code. It also proposed bylaws to regulate dating and escort services, exotic entertainers and massage parlours, including licensing, which were subsequently enacted. Toronto In response to the 1995 Federal-Provincial-Territorial Working Group on Prostitution report \\"Dealing with Prostitution in Canada,\\" Toronto's Board of Health advocated decriminalisation in 1995, with the City taking the responsibility of regulating the industry. The City then endorsed these proposals, further specifying that it involved only adult prostitution, supporting the federal report's proposals on juveniles. Toronto also enacted a bylaw to restrict intimate erotic lap dancing in August 1995 to prohibit physical contact, including touching, between patrons and attendants, with a maximum fine of $50,000, and revocation of licences. Adult entertainment parlours were unsuccessful in having this quashed by the courts. In Ont. Adult Entertainment Bar Assn. v. Toronto, 26 O.R. (3d) 257 [1995], it was held that the bylaw was enacted for valid objectives relating to business regulation, including health, safety and the prevention of crime, and did not usurp the Government's jurisdiction over criminal law. The court did not believe that the bylaw violated dancers' freedom of expression. Close-contact dancing was not a constitutionally protected right. This was upheld at the appellate level. Other Other cities saw Edmonton and Toronto as examples of allowing municipal intervention without being ultra vires and the 1990s saw Victoria, Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Sault Ste. Marie and Windsor following suit. Civil suits, however, were undertaken on the basis of over-charging licence fees In 2002, an Edmonton prostitute commenced an action against the City, demanding it lower the license fee for escorts from $1,600. The action claimed that the City of Edmonton was \\"living off the avails of prostitution\\" by imposing such a high licence fee. =Provincial initiatives= In 1984, the British Columbia Attorney General applied to the B.C. Supreme Court for an injunction to restrain, as a common law public nuisance, prostitution‑related activity in a residential area of Vancouver. The interim injunction (A.G. B.C. v. Couillard (1984), 42 C.R. (3d) 273) prohibited persons from publicly offering or appearing to offer themselves, directly or indirectly, for the purposes of prostitution, in addition it addressed trespassing and disturbance of the peace by prostitutes. Evidence was presented from residents of the West End as to the effect on their neighbourhood. However, the interim measure was rescinded after the enactment of new legislation in December 1985. In 1984, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia applied for an injunction in the City of Halifax. The application was refused on the grounds of being ultra vires. The Court of Appeal upheld this in March 1985 (A.G. N.S. v. Beaver (1985), 67 N.S.R. (2d) 281, 155 A.P.R. 281). The provinces have continued to seek ways of controlling prostitution without infringing Parliament's jurisdiction over the Criminal Code. The Traffic and Highway Acts in several provinces have been amended to allow police to seize, impound and sell vehicles of clients. Manitoba enacted this in 1999. In 2001 and 2002, Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan followed. Ontario went further in 2002 with a civil law allowing the province to ask the courts to freeze, seize and forfeit to the Crown property that is the proceeds of unlawful activity including prostitution, without involving criminal charges. Other provincial Acts authorize the suspension of a driver's licence on conviction of a prostitution related offence involving a motor vehicle. =Inquiries= Fraser Committee (1983–85) The Justice Minister established a committee in June 1983 to enquire into prostitution and pornography, headed by Paul Fraser, which reported in April 1985. The other members of the committee were: Susan Clark, Mount St Vincent University, Halifax; Mary Eberts, a civil litigator specialising in equality issues, from Toronto; Jean-Paul Gilbert, a member of the National Parole Board, Montreal; John McLaren, Dean of Law at the University of Windsor; Andrée Ruffo, a lawyer practising in family law in Montreal; Joan Wallace, a lawyer specialising in human rights, Vancouver.\\"Pornography and Prostitution in Canada - Report of the Special Committee on Pornography and Prostitution - Summary\\", Department of Justice Canada, 1985. That report stated that prostitution was widespread in Canada, particularly in cities. Although empirical evidence was lacking, it concluded that economic necessity was a major motivation for many women. Public opinion was ambivalent. Most people opposed further criminalization, but there was support for actions to alleviate public nuisance associated with it. In the report, three strategies were considered; criminalization, decriminalization, and regulation. Further criminalization would prohibit all forms of prostitution but was felt to be impossible to enforce, had little public support, and represented the imposition of moral views through the criminal law. The Committee did not fully support decriminalisation either, on the grounds that it found little evidence that all of the harms would be alleviated. The Committee also rejected regulation by the state. Instead, the Committee put forward recommendations having elements of all three approaches. For the first time, recommendations addressed underlying economic and social issues, whose alleviation might improve the situation. The Committee recommended addressing social inequalities between genders, assisting women and youth in need, and funding of community groups involved with prostitution. While the Committee (with one dissension) did not support complete decriminalisation, it suggested thorough revision of the criminal law, with tougher penalties for street prostitution because of the harm of disturbance and nuisance. It suggested a new offence of interfering or attempting to interfere, on more than one occasion, with pedestrian or vehicular traffic for the purposes of offering to engage in prostitution or of employing the services of a prostitute but not the mere offer or acceptance without disturbance. This was to be balanced by easing restrictions on other activities. Bawdy house provisions were to be amended to allow up to two workers on a premise as out was illogical to permit prostitution but make it illegal to perform it anywhere. The committee thought that a maximum of two persons would be unlikely to be associated with public nuisance and would allow a worker to use their own home. It also proposed that prostitution establishments be permitted to be licensed and operated by provincial or territorial governments, like other businesses. The Committee recommended repeal of the offences of procuring and living on the avails of prostitution, limiting this to the use of force, threats or other coercive or threatening behaviour. The Committee concluded its report as follows: > Prostitution cannot be dealt with on a piecemeal basis, but only by > carefully linking the provisions on each aspect of prostitution-related > activity. Response was varied. Authorities were positive about strengthening measures against street work, but negative about relaxing sanctions against indoor work, and no support emerged at the Provincial level. C-49 Review (1987-90) Bill C-49 (1985) stated its objectives were to remove \\"street prostitutes and their customers from \\"downtown neighbourhoods.\\" It also mandated a review within three years. A research study was therefore undertaken in 1987–88 to determine whether C-49 resulted in \\"a reduction in the nuisance of street prostitution Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax were chosen as major test sites, with smaller studies in Regina, Winnipeg, London, Niagara Falls, Ottawa, Trois-Rivières and Quebec City. Interviews were conducted with police officers, Crown prosecutors, defence lawyers, judges, prostitutes, customers, pimps, social agency staff, and business people and residents. Baseline data was available from the 1984 report of the Fraser Committee. The report, \\"Street Prostitution: Assessing the Impact of the Law\\" was published in July 1989 by the Department of Justice. The report concluded that although the > practice of street prostitution was modified somewhat by the communicating > law ... (i)n most of the cities included in the study, street prostitution > was as prevalent as it was before the new law. In 1989, the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor General conducted a comprehensive review of Bill C‑49, reporting in October 1990. Its three recommendations were the following:  (1) that the departments responsible for justice, health and welfare, and employment, at all levels of government, develop programs to provide start‑up and core funding to community‑based agencies providing integrated, holistic programs accessible and responsive to the needs of male and female prostitutes wishing to leave the street solicitation trade;  (2) that the Identification of Criminals Act be amended to allow for the fingerprinting and photographing of those charged under section 213 of the Criminal Code, whether as prostitutes or as customers; and  (3) that section 213 of the Criminal Code be amended to provide sentencing judges with the discretion to prohibit persons convicted of street solicitation involving a motor vehicle, in addition to any other penalty imposed, from driving a motor vehicle for a period not to exceed three months. Essentially, in its 1991 response, the government rejected the recommendations and did not amend legislation. It suggested that rather than proceed with developing exit strategies, further consultation should be undertaken, and that further penalties would not enhance exiting. The final recommendation was also rejected as being irrational. =Further amendments to the Criminal Code= Despite the apparently neutral language of the law, the courts continued to interpret 'person' as woman, requiring a 1983 amendment defining \\"prostitute\\" as a person of either sex who engages in prostitution. The next problem, also relating to gender neutrality, was the issue of whether it was discriminatory, applying only to the seller not the buyer. Case law was inconsistent. The B.C. Court of Appeal held \\"for the purpose of prostitution\\" referred only to the seller (R. v. Dudak (1978), 3 C.R. (3d) 68) while the Ontario Court of Appeal held (in R. v. DiPaola (1978), 4 C.R. (3d) 121) that it referred to either party. C-49 (1985) It was clear that the law needed to be reviewed, and Bill C‑49 was introduced in 1985, coming into force on December 28, 1985, replacing section 195.1. The new offence (section 213) referred to any person in a public place (or place open to public view) who stopped or attempted to stop a motor vehicle, impeded pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or interfered with the entry to a building, or stopped any person or engaged in > communicating in a public place for the purposes of prostitution \\"Public place\\" was defined as including motor vehicles in or on public places. This section was to be reviewed after three years. The Justice Minister stated that further amendments would be forthcoming, but nothing came of this. The section was challenged unsuccessfully in the Supreme Court in 1990. The new section was welcomed by citizens and authorities, but critics claimed it would merely displace the phenomenon, endanger workers, and give the police and court too much discretionary power. C-15 (1988) In 1988 Bill C‑15 made it an offence to obtain or attempt to obtain the sexual services of a minor, increasing the maximum penalty to 14 years for anyone convicted of living on the avails of a prostitute under the age of 18 years. C-36 (2014)  Sign about Bill C-36 in a massage parlor in Montreal, September 2015 Following a declaration by the Supreme Court in December 2013 that certain key provisions in the existing law were unconstitutional, Peter MacKay introduced Bill C-36, the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act in June 2014. The bill was approved by the Senate on November 4, 2014, and came into effect on December 6, 2014. Unlike previous legislation, C-36 primarily targets those who buy sex, and seeks to reduce the demand for prostitution—a term which was widely replaced with the euphemism \\"sexual services for consideration\\". Bill C-36 made it illegal to \\"[obtain] sexual services for consideration\\", receive \\"material benefits\\" from sexual services performed by another person, and to \\"knowingly advertise an offer to provide sexual services for consideration\\" by another person. Individual sex workers are given a form of immunity for advertising or receiving consideration from \\"their own\\" sexual services. The previous prohibition on communicating in public places for the purposes of such services was loosened, and now only applies to communications conducted at or near day care facilities, schools, and playgrounds, and when one interrupts pedestrian or vehicular traffic to perform such communications. Supporters of Bill C-36 argued that the bill would help improve safety for sex workers. Those against the law argued that the law restricts the ability for sex workers to safely search for clients and conduct their business. Emily Symons, chairperson of POWER, an advocacy group for prostitutes in the Ottawa region, argued that C-36 \\"not only reintroduces laws deemed unconstitutional in a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court only one year ago — it actually makes them worse.\\"  References  Prostitution in Canada Canadian law Prostitution Canada ","title":"History of prostitution in Canada"},{"id":"31196356","text":"Sydney Fairbrother, from an 1896 publication.

It consists of six episodes. The series continues the actions of Section D, a fictional counter-terrorism division of the British Security Service (MI5). In August 2011, Kudos Film and Television, the production company behind Spooks, announced that the tenth series will be its last, as they wanted the show to end \\"in its prime\\". In this series, former Russian spy-turned-politician Ilya Gavrik (Jonathan Hyde), Harry Pearce's (Peter Firth) opposite during the Cold War, proposes a strategic partnership between Russia and the United Kingdom. Also with Gavrik is his wife Elena (Alice Krige), with whom Harry had an affair during the 1980s. However, over the course of the series Section D must stop those who intend to sabotage the partnership. As well as Firth, Nicola Walker, Max Brown, Shazad Latif, Simon Russell Beale, Lara Pulver and Geoffrey Streatfeild are included as the main cast. The final episode includes a cameo appearance of Matthew Macfadyen, who headlined the first two years of the show. Ratings for the series generally struggled as it went against Downton Abbey, a highly successful period drama series from ITV1, which was seen by nearly twice the audience; the series attained a per-episode average ratings of 5.41 million viewers. Reviews of the final series were polarised between positive and negative, with critical opinions ranging from \\"as impressive as ever\\" to looking \\"tattered and tired\\". The DVD box set of the tenth series was released on 28 November 2011 in Region 2, on 6 March 2012 in Region 1, and on 4 April 2012 in Region 4. Cast =Main= * Peter Firth as Harry Pearce * Nicola Walker as Ruth Evershed * Max Brown as Demitri Levendis * Shazad Latif as Tariq Masood (episodes 1-2) * Lara Pulver as Erin Watts * Geoffrey Streatfield as Calum Reed =Guest= * Simon Russell Beale as Home Secretary William Towers * Jonathan Hyde as Ilya Gavrik * Alice Krige as Elena Gavrik * and Matthew Macfadyen as Tom Quinn (episode 6) Episodes Casting The cast for series ten (from left to right): Max Brown as Demitri Levendis, Nicola Walker as Ruth Evershed, Peter Firth as Harry Pearce, Geoffrey Streatfield as Calum Reed, Lara Pulver as Erin Watts. Peter Firth returned as Harry Pearce. The tenth series began with Harry on \\"gardening leave\\" after trading Albany, a state secret, for Ruth's safety. Also, Harry recalls an operation during the 1980s where he fell in love with Russian double agent Elena. Firth said that Harry would not be killed off in the series. Sam Reid will play a younger version of Harry. Nicola Walker returned as Ruth Evershed and Max Brown reprises his role as Dimitri Levendis. Brown said of his return to Spooks; \\"I couldn't wait to get back under the skin of Dimitri and see what new challenges he faced this year. He's a bit more senior now because he's been on the Grid for a year.\\" Shazad Latif also reprised his role as Tariq Masood for the first two episodes, and Simon Russell Beale returned as Home Secretary William Towers. The series also introduced several new characters. Lara Pulver was cast as the new Chief of Section D, Erin Watts. Pulver described Erin as \\"young\\", \\"feisty\\", and has got \\"something to prove... but she has a maturity and a delicacy with the matters she's handling that makes her really good at her job.\\" The character is also a single mother. The actress returned to London from Los Angeles to participate in other projects in the UK. When the Spooks casting directors heard of her arrival, they approached her. She was back in Los Angeles when she was told she won the part. Geoffrey Streatfeild was cast as Calum Reed, an information technology (IT) expert. Streatfeild researched his role before starting. The actor was a fan of Spooks and found it \\"weird to join a group of people when you know their characters.\\" Jonathan Hyde and Alice Krige also had special guest roles in the series; Krige portrayed Elena, with Jenni Herzberg playing the younger version of Elena. Two main characters from the ninth series did not return for the tenth. Richard Armitage did not return as Lucas North. Firth has stated that Lucas \\"was always going to die\\" at the end of the ninth series. At the time the series was produced, Armitage was filming for The Hobbit film project. Also, Sophia Myles did not return as Beth Bailey as the character was decommissioned between the ninth and tenth series. Myles left the series as she wanted to pursue other projects in America. Matthew Macfadyen, who starred in the first three series as protagonist Tom Quinn, returned for a cameo appearance in the series finale. Production =Crew= Jonathan Brackley and Sam Vincent, who have been the head writers for the previous ninth series of Spooks, returned to their writing duties for the tenth series. Sean Cook and Anthony Neilson are also writers of the series. Alrick Riley, Julian Holmes and Bharat Nalluri are the series directors, with Nalluri directing the last two episodes. Chris Fry is the series producer, and Jane Featherstone, Simon Crawford Collins and Howard Burch are the executive producers. =Development= Early on in the series's developmental stage, it was decided that it would only consist of six episodes, likely because of budget cuts at the BBC. The series featured a mix of standalone stories, and a \\"big old arc\\" that runs through it. The arc focuses on Harry, the only remaining original lead character from the first series. The Harry/Ruth storyline continued, as Firth believed it is \\"too delicious to stop\\". The series also saw the pair's relationship enter a new phase, though it may probably be \\"too late for them to proceed any further\\". Brackley and Vincent realise that there are fans of the show who will be \\"immensely cheesed off if they get anything less than Ruth riding in on a unicorn to marry Harry in a white suit\\", but at the same time know other fans \\"love the uncompromising toughness of Spooks. And both viewpoints were always well represented around the table\\". The storyline also features Harry and the Section D team forging new relationships with different countries, including Russia, which in the series has a better image in the Middle East. Because of this, the writers storyline a deteriorating \\"Special Relationship\\" between Britain and the United States. For the finale episode, the writers went through \\"countless\\" ideas for how it would end. Some of the dropped ideas lasted for weeks, one of them being Harry detonating a nuclear weapon in Siberia. Other characters had their own stories as well. Dimitri was the \\"chief action man\\", with his very own centric episode, where he was to honeytrap a young woman in the third episode. Though Myles left the series, there were plans to explore her character's past further should Myles remain on board. On the other hand, it allowed the writers to introduce Erin Watts and Calum Reed. Real world events were often written into Spooks episodes, though they do not alter their main plots. Episodes of the tenth series made references to such world events in 2011 such as the 2011 Libyan civil war, and the death of Osama bin Laden. Filming took place from March, to June 2011. =Series conclusion= In August 2011, Kudos announced that the tenth series of Spooks would be the final series. Executive producer Jane Featherstone decided to end the series during its writing stage, stating \\"It's very tempting to keep going, and we have had ongoing conversations with our partners at the BBC about it, but the heart of the show has become those two characters [Harry and Ruth] and I feel they own it. We've followed the arc of their personal story and I think they've brought us to a natural end, which you will all see played out later this year.\\" It was also intended to end the series \\"in its prime.\\" Writers Brackley and Vincent noted \\"there was always a strong possibility of it being the end, so throughout the [writing] process we were looking for ways to infuse it with a sense of finality. We'd done a fair bit of writing before it was made definite by Kudos – but had plenty of time to plot a true conclusion. And crucially, by the time we began to write the final ep, we knew it would be the last.\\" They also stated; \\"When Kudos asked for our opinion, we said we'd hate to see it cancelled on a cliffhanger – it just wouldn't be right, or fair on the fans. Call us suck-ups, but you have to really admire Kudos for having the confidence to kill off a very successful show – purely because it's the right thing creatively.\\" Firth believed the series is getting to a point where the producers were starting to run out of story ideas, as virtually every type of antagonists have been featured in past episodes. Broadcast and reception =Trailers= A number of trailers were produced before the broadcast of the tenth series. A first look trailer was first released on July 2011 on the BBC, which also consists clips from other BBC programmes including The Body Farm, Doctor Who, The Hour, Merlin and Page Eight. In early September a short teaser trailer was released, which includes clips of the series with the tagline \\"This is the end.\\" This was followed by a full 30-second trailer a week later. =Broadcast and ratings= The tenth series began broadcast on Sunday, 18 September 2011, during the 9 pm to 10 pm timeslot, on BBC One. It was considered a move as previous series were often broadcast on a Monday. The move would make the finale series a \\"special event\\" by placing it on a Sunday night. However, it emerged that the final series would face off against the second series of the highly successful ITV1 period drama series Downton Abbey, which averaged nine million viewers in its first year. The BBC however, defended the position by saying that \\"Downton and Spooks are very different shows and offer a real alternative for audiences.\\" After the broadcast of the first episode, Spooks received overnight viewing figures of 4.62 million with a 17 per cent audience share. It lost out to Downton Abbey which received almost twice the viewers, with nine million and a 34.6 per cent share. Overnight ratings for the series ten premiere was down from the 5.58 million that tuned in for the series nine premiere episode. By the second week, overnight figures for Spooks went down nearly half a million to 4.15 million, as Downton ratings increased. However, despite being trounced by Downton Abbey, Spooks saw a gradual increase in viewership over the subsequent weeks, leading up to a boost of up to 5.13 million viewers for the final episode on 23 October 2011. With consolidated ratings factored in, the last series of Spooks was given a per-episode average of 5.41 million viewers.See the ratings on the episode table above. Look up the top 30 weekly programmes from weeks ending 18 September to 23 October 2011 from the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board website. =Critical reception= Critical reactions to the series were polarised between positive and negative. Among the positive reviews, Peter Sharples of CultBox rated the series five out of five, commending it for looking \\"more cinematic than in previous years,\\" adding \\"any reduction in budget certainly doesn't show, with the action scenes as impressive as ever\\". Sharples was also appreciative of the \\"pretty strong\\" new cast, including Pulver for \\"making a big impression as a tough action girl juggling responsibilities as section head with those of a single parent\\", and Streatfeild for being \\"amusingly cocky and insubordinate\\". Sharples also commented that \\"ultimately Series 10 belongs to Peter Firth and Nicola Walker (more so than ever in the final, heartrending moments), confirming that it is they who held Spooks together and, pushed even more to the fore, elevate the series to a new level\\". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian's review was mostly a response to John le Carré who branded Spooks as \\"crap\\" for its lack of a true representation of MI5; \\"Lighten up J le C, no one thinks it is actually like that, it's just a bit of fun. And it is fun, exciting too. Plus it deals with important social issues...Spooks sends out positive messages about work and single-parenting; you don't get that in Tinker Tailor ... OK, it is crap, but good crap\\". Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy listed the final series of as \\"Best of the Rest\\" for 2011, television shows that failed to make the website's top 25 television series. Jeffery however, gave the series a favourable review, stating that although the show \\"waxed and waned over the years”, the tenth series \\"saw Spooks back on top form\\", adding \\"the final run unfolded with a great deal of pace, excitement and emotion\\". Adam Sweeting of The Arts Desk however, said that the tenth series \\"hadn't been the finest of seasons, partly because the death of Richard Armitage's Lucas North at the end of Series 9 left a void which was never successfully filled. Lara Pulver never seemed comfortable as Erin Watts, Section D's new head, because she looked as if she'd been seconded from a modelling agency, while promoting Dimitri (Max Brown) up the batting order merely allowed him to become more faceless by the hour\\". Andrew Pettie of The Daily Telegraph believed that Spooks is looking \\"tattered and tired\\", with a plot that is \\"about as up-to- date as the Berlin Wall\\". Pettie was also critical of the \\"motion analysis filter\\", a series-adopted technique for matching people by the way they walk. Pettie \\"The rare moments of intrigue were dredged from Harry's past affair with a Russian double agent. There will no doubt be more double-dealing to come. But in recent years the most enjoyable bits of Spooks have also been the least plausible, as the scriptwriters really let their hair down and do something silly\\", he rated the premiere episode two out of five. Tom Sutcliff of The Independent also rated the premiere episode two out of five, stating \\"Spooks isn't even true to its own account of the world, let alone the one the rest of us inhabit. At one moment, a senior Russian minister was described as virtually unfollowable because of his wily knowledge of tradecraft. At the next, one of Harry's boys was sauntering past the boot of his car to clip on a tracker, in full view of the target and his security men\\". Home video release The tenth series of Spooks was first released on DVD on 28 November 2011 in the United Kingdom (Region 2), and was later released in the United States (Region 1) on 6 March 2012. It will be released in Australia (Region 4) on 4 April 2012. The box set includes all six episodes of the final series on three discs, with two of the episodes containing optional audio commentaries from the show's writers and directors. Other special features include two featurettes; Spooks' Top 10 Moments, which comprises cast and crew members picking their favourite Spooks scenes, and Harry's Game, which features interviews concerning the story arc of the tenth series. It was released with a \\"15\\" British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) certificate (unsuitable for viewers under the age of 15 years).

The protection of the areas is the responsibility of the government of Ukraine, specifically the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Ukraine has several categories of protected areas of Ukraine and the protected areas include: *National Parks in Ukraine *Biosphere Preserves of Ukraine *National Nature Parks of Ukraine *Nature Preserves of Ukraine *Ramsar sites in Ukraine *Regional landscape parks of Ukraine *Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine *Nature monuments of Ukraine *Protected tracts of Ukraine *Habitat / Species Managed Areas of Ukraine Designation and administration There are two separate ministries that, together with the Cabinet of Ministers, administer the preservation of protected areas on the national scale. Local preservation is conducted through the regional State Administrations. The areas or landmarks that are designated as protected may carry either cultural or environmental value. Environmentally protected areas and objects in Ukraine are designed in the Nature Preservation Fund (PZF, \\"Природно-заповідний фонд України\\")Information on the State Service for Nature Preservation which includes national parks, (nature preserves), natural landmarks, biosphere preserves, and other areas. Areas and objects from the cultural heritage, including museums, are also protected. The preservation of these areas and objects is supervised by different government ministries, which designate special agencies for the task of preservation. All objects from the cultural heritage are recorded in the State Registry for Fixed Landmarks of Ukraine (sometimes - simply as the Registry). Since 2010, the governing body responsible for the organization, protection, and use of the Nature Preservation Fund has been the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine, which designated the State Service for Nature Preservation as a specialized department. The governing body responsible for the organization, protection, and use of all recorded nature preserves, museums, and other objects in the cultural heritage is the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine), which designated Derzhkultspadshchyna (abbreviated for the State Cultural Heritage) as a specialized department for this preservation.Загальні відомості про Державну службу охорони національної культурної спадщини =Museums= Cultural preservation in Ukraine is conducted by the Ministry of Culture, as well as by individual museums, which may or not be state-owned.The Law of Ukraine on museum and museum affairs Museums are generally regulated by a special law on museums, which differs from the statutes of the government agency Derzhkultspadshchyna;Про утворення Державної служби охорони культурної спадщини however, museums that are part of a cultural preserve fall under the jurisdiction of the government and are supervised by Derzhkultspadshchyna. Individual museum objects or collections that are constantly kept on the territory of Ukraine, regardless of their origin and ownership, as well as museum objects or collections that are located outside of Ukraine and are property of Ukraine or subject to return there, according to international laws, are part of the Museum Fund of Ukraine. The Museum Fund of Ukraine may or not be part of state program for the preservation of the cultural heritage. =Chernobyl Exclusion Zone= The preservation of the cultural heritage and natural environment in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is exclusively conducted by the administration of that zone, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Emergencies. Nature preservation =History= The Main Directory of National Nature Parks and Nature Preservation, which supervised the protected areas of Ukraine, was created in 1995. In 2001 the Directory was reorganized into the State Service for Nature Preservation. Of all the different kinds of protected natural areas, the most important are considered to be nature preserves (zapovedniks), national nature parks, and nature reserves (zakazniks). The total area of the protected areas of Ukraine consists of , or around 5.4% of the total area of the country. The largest categories of protected areas are regional nature reserves, which account for over a third of the Nature Preservation Fund, and national nature parks, which represent about a quarter. The smallest are botanic gardens and zoos. In 2010, the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, through the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, submitted a proposition for parliamentary review, which outlined a plan for the development of the national ecological program of nature preservation through the year 2020. This proposal would increase the protected natural areas of Ukraine twofold. = Categories of protected natural areas = The scope of protected natural areas in Ukraine encompasses land and water areas, nature complexes and objects that carry special nature- protecting, scientific, aesthetic, recreational and other value. Areas are designated protected in order to preserve the natural variety of landscapes and the gene pool of their fauna and flora; to support general ecological balance; and to provide background environmental monitoring. Under the laws of Ukraine, these areas are treated as a part of the national heritage, as well as an integral part of the global system of natural areas and objects that are under special protection. Protected natural areas in Ukraine are divided into one of the following: natural areas and objects, which include nature preserves, biosphere preserves, national nature parks, regional landscape parks, nature reserves, natural monuments, and protected tracts; and artificially created objects, such as botanic gardens, arboreta, zoological parks, and park architecture monuments. Depending on their ecological, scientific, historical, or cultural value, nature reserves, natural monuments, botanic gardens, arboreta, zoological parks, and park architecture monuments may be of nationwide or local importance. Nature reserves can have varying degrees of protection, according to their botanical, generally zoological, ornithological, entomological, ichthyological, hydrological, generally geological, paleontological, or karst-speleological features, or their landscape and forestry; natural monuments can be complex, botanical, zoological, hydrological, and geological. =Forms of property= The territories of nature preserves, biosphere preserves, and other natural resources given to the national nature parks are the property of the Ukrainian people. Regional landscape parks, certain zones of biosphere preserves (buffer, anthropogenic landscapes, regulated preservation regime), and other lands and natural resources of national nature parks, nature reserves, natural monuments, protected tracts, botanical gardens, arboreta, zoological parks, and park architecture monuments may be the property of the Ukrainian people as well as any other forms of property provided by the legislation of Ukraine. Botanical gardens, arboreta, and zoological parks created before June 16, 1992 are not subject to privatization. In the event of changes to the form of property on land where nature reserves, natural monuments, protected tracts, and park architecture monuments are located, the landowners are required to ensure their continued protection and preservation. =Legal basis for protected designation= The objective, scientific profile, nature of operation, and protection regimen of protected natural areas are defined by laws set forth by the central body of executive power in the sphere of Environmental Protection. Nature preserves, biosphere preserves, national nature parks, botanic gardens, arboreta, zoological parks of statewide importance, as well as regional landscape parks are considered legal entities. Botanic gardens, arboreta, zoological parks of local importance and park architecture monuments may be recognized as legal entities in respect to the legislation of Ukraine. Culture Preservation =Classification= There are three major classes for objects of cultural heritage. * structures (creations) - individually standing compositions of architectural and engineering art, compositions of monumental sculpturing and monumental painting, archeological objects, caves with existing evidence of human activity (building or quarters in them that preserved an authentic evidence about prominent historical events, life and work of known individuals); * complexes (ensembles) - unified or separate topographically defined set of objects of cultural heritage among each other; * prominent sites (points of interest) - zones or landscapes, nature-anthropogenic creations that brought to our time a value from an archeological, aesthetic, ethnological, historical, architectural, creative, scientific, or artistic perspective. (See List of historic reserves in Ukraine) There are following types of objects of cultural heritage: * archeological * historical * of monumental art * of architecture * of urban development * of park architecture * landscape * of science and technology =Forms of property= All monuments except monuments of archeology may be a property of state, community, or individual. All monuments of archeology including the ones that are underwater along with any movable objects related to them are a state property. Such movable objects are attributed to the state part of Museum Fund of Ukraine, and subject for registration and preservation in accordance with law. Form of property on a treasury that is considered a monument (attraction) is defined by the Civil Codex of Ukraine.Civil Codex of Ukraine In a document that certifies the form of property on a monument are indicated category of the monument, date and the number of decision for its state registration. Lands where located monuments of archeology are property of state or withdrawn (sold) to state in the established by law order, excluding the land plots with the monument of archeology as fields of ancient battles. =Organization of objects of cultural heritage= In order to protect the traditional nature of the environment of populated places they recorded in the List of historical populated sites of Ukraine which is approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Any urban, architectural, and landscape transformations as well as building, meliorative, road construction, and any excavations without the permission of the respective authority for protection of cultural heritage is prohibited. Complex (ensemble) of monuments with its entire collection of components that carry cultural, historic, and scientific value, specially, planned, and functionally allocated within the structure of a populated settlement or localized outside of it, maybe declared a historic-cultural preserve of state or local importance. Historic-cultural preserved territory is declared a historically formed territory, within which remained significant number of objects of cultural heritage.

The products of their metabolism can have benign preservative effects. 3D stick model of nisin, a particularly effective preservative produced by some lactic acid bacteria. Biopreservation is the use of natural or controlled microbiota or antimicrobials as a way of preserving food and extending its shelf life. The biopreservation of food, especially utilizing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are inhibitory to food spoilage microbes, has been practiced since early ages, at first unconsciously but eventually with an increasingly robust scientific foundation.Lacroix, Christophe.

Online version available at: http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt009273P1/protective-cultures- antimicrobial/identifying-new-protective Beneficial bacteria or the fermentation products produced by these bacteria are used in biopreservation to control spoilage and render pathogens inactive in food. There are a various modes of action through which microorganisms can interfere with the growth of others such as organic acid production, resulting in a reduction of pH and the antimicrobial activity of the un-dissociated acid molecules, a wide variety of small inhibitory molecules including hydrogen peroxide, etc. It is a benign ecological approach which is gaining increasing attention.Ananou S, Maqueda M, Martínez-Bueno M and Valdivia E (2007) \\"Biopreservation, an ecological approach to improve the safety and shelf-life of foods\\" In: A. Méndez-Vilas (Ed.) Communicating Current Research and Educational Topics and Trends in Applied Microbiology, Formatex. . Biopreservative agents and modes of action =Lactic acid bacteria= Of special interest are lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Lactic acid bacteria have antagonistic properties which make them particularly useful as biopreservatives. When LABs compete for nutrients, their metabolites often include active antimicrobials such as lactic and acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and peptide bacteriocins. Some LABs produce the antimicrobial nisin which is a particularly effective preservative. These days LAB bacteriocins are used as an integral part of hurdle technology. Using them in combination with other preservative techniques can effectively control spoilage bacteria and other pathogens, and can inhibit the activities of a wide spectrum of organisms, including inherently resistant Gram-negative bacteria.\\" Lactic acid bacteria and propionibacteria have been extensively studied for their efficiency against spoilage causing yeasts and molds in food spoilage.Lacroix, Christophe.

This figure illustrates the pathway of food preservation followed by lactic acid bacteria involving nisin, as well as the pathway of food preservation followed by salt. Additionally, the hurdle effect of food preservation, such as by adding lactic acid bacteria and salt to a food product, is illustrated and described. =Yeast= In addition to lactic acid bacteria, yeasts also have been reported to have a biopreservation effect due to their antagonistic activities relying on the competition for nutrients, production and tolerance of high concentrations of ethanol, as well as the synthesis of a large class of antimicrobial compounds exhibiting large spectrum of activity against food spoilage microorganisms, but also against plant, animal and human pathogen. A bacterium/yeast that is a suitable candidate for use as a biopreservative does not necessarily have to ferment the food. However, if conditions are suitable for microbial growth, then a biopreservative bacterium will compete well for nutrients with the spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in the food. As a product of its metabolism, it should also produce acids and other antimicrobial agents, particularly bacteriocins. Biopreservative bacteria, such as lactic acid bacteria, must be harmless to humans.Yousef AE and Carolyn Carlstrom C (2003) Food microbiology: a laboratory manual Wiley, Page 226. . =Bacteriophages= Bacteriophages (Greek for 'bacteria eater'), or simply phages, are viruses which infect bacteria.Lacroix, Christophe. (2011). Protective Cultures, Antimicrobial Metabolites and Bacteriophages for Food and Beverage Biopreservation - 6. Bacteriophages and Food Safety. Woodhead Publishing. Online version available at: http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt009277EL/protective-cultures- antimicrobial/bacteriophages-food-safety The majority of all bacteriophages known exhibit a double-stranded DNA genome inside the virion capsid and belong to the order of tailed phages, Caudovirales. The tailed phages can be further separated into three families: Podoviridae, which are characterized by very short tails; Myoviridae, which exhibit longer, straight and contractile tails; and Siphoviridae, which can be identified due to their long and flexible tails. Another well studied group of phages with many applications, although minor in terms of species diversity, is represented by filamentous phages which exhibit a single stranded DNA genome decorated by a helical protein layer surrounding the DNA molecule. Bacteriophages are ubiquitously distributed in nature and can also be isolated from human or animal associated microflora. They outnumber their bacterial host species by a factor of ten representing the most abundant self-replicating entities on earth with an estimated 1031 phages in total.BRUSSOW H and KUTTER E (2005). 'Phage ecology.' In Kutter E and Sulakvelidze A (eds) Bacteriophages - Biology and Application, New York, CRC Press, 13 1 pp. The idea of using phages against unwanted bacteria developed shortly after their discovery. With the improvements in organic chemistry during the 1950s, exploration and development of broad spectrum antibiotics displaced interest in bacteriophage research. Several laboratories have been testing suitability of bacteriophage isolates to control certain bacterial pathogens. Significant advancements in this research have been made at the Bacteriophage Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia, where phage therapy is routinely applied in medicine research field. Today treatment of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a challenging task. Recently, research on bacteriophages has gained additional momentum in light of the identification of antibiotic-resistant pathogens of infectious diseases, wherein the application of antibiotics is not effectively working, therefore research on the application of bacteriophages is being reviewed intensely. Bacteriophages have recently received a generally recognized as safe status based on their lack of toxicity and other detrimental effects to human health for application in meat products in USA. Phage preparations specific for L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and S. enterica serotypes have been commercialized and approved for application in foods or as part of surface decontamination protocols. Meat biopreservation In meat processing, biopreservation has been extensively studied in fermented meat products and ready to eat meat products.Lacroix, Christophe. (2011).

Competitive enhancement strategies that have been developed include competitive exclusion, addition of a microbial supplement (probiotic) that improves gastrointestinal health, and adding a limiting, non-host digestible nutrient (prebiotic) that provides an existing (or introduced) commensal microbial population a competitive advantage in the gastrointestinal tract. Each of these approaches utilizes the activities of the native microbial ecosystem against pathogens by capitalizing on the natural microbial competition. Generally speaking, competitive enhancement strategies offer a natural 'green' method to reduce pathogens in the gut of food animals. Seafood biopreservation Fishery products are a source of wide variety of valuable nutrients such as proteins, vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, taurine, etc. Fishery products, however, are also associated with human intoxication and infection. Approximately 10 to 20% of food-borne illnesses are attributed to fish consumption.Lacroix, Christophe. (2011). Protective Cultures, Antimicrobial Metabolites and Bacteriophages for Food and Beverage Biopreservation - 13. Applications of Protective Cultures, Bacteriocins and Bacteriophages in Fresh Seafood and Seafood Products. Woodhead Publishing. Online version available at: http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/pdf/id:kt00927B0C/protective-cultures- antimicrobial/applications-protective-2 Changing consumer demand has driven the appeal of traditional processes applied to seafood (e.g. salting, smoking and canning) lower compared to mild technologies involving lower salt content, lower cooking temperature and vacuum packing (VP)/modified atmosphere packing (MAP). These products, designed as lightly preserved fish products (LPFP), are usually produced from fresh seafood and further processing increases risk of cross contamination. These milder treatments are usually not sufficient to destroy microorganisms, and in some cases psychrotolerant pathogenic and spoilage bacteria can develop during the extended shelf-life of LPFP. Many of these products are also eaten raw, so minimizing the presence and preventing growth of microorganisms is essential for the food quality and safety. The microbial safety and stability of food are based on an application of preservative factors called hurdles. The delicate texture and flavor of seafood are very sensitive to the decontamination technologies such as cooking, and more recent mild technologies such as pulsed light, high pressure, ozone, and ultrasound. Chemical preservatives, which are not processes but ingredients, are out of favor with consumers due to natural preservatives demand. An alternative solution that is gaining more and more attention is biopreservation technology.RODGERS s (2001), 'Preserving non- fermented refrigerated foods with microbial cultures: a review', Trends in Food Science and Technology 12,276-284.DORTU c and THONART P (2009), 'Bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria: interest for food products biopreservation', Biotechnol Agron Soc Environ 13, 143-154.CALO-MATA P, ARLINDO S, BOEHME K, DE MIGUEL T, PASCOAL A and BARROSVELAZQUEZ J (2008), 'Current applications and future trends of lactic acid bacteria and their bacteriocins for the biopreservation of aquatic food products', Food andBioprocess Technology 1,43-63. In fish processing, biopreservation is achieved by adding antimicrobials or by increasing the acidity of the fish muscle. Most bacteria stop multiplying when the pH is less than 4.5. Traditionally, acidity has been increased by fermentation, marination or by directly adding acetic, citric or lactic acid to food products. Other preservatives include nitrites, sulphites, sorbates, benzoates and essential oils.FAO: Preservation techniques Fisheries and aquaculture department, Rome. Updated 27 May 2005. Retrieved 14 March 2011. The main reason for less documented studies for application of protective microorganisms, bacteriophages or bacteriocins on seafood products for biopreservation compared to dairy or meat products is probably that the early stages of biopreservation have occurred mainly in fermented foodstuffs that are not so developed among seafood products. The selection of potential protective bacteria in seafood products is challenging due to the fact that they need adaptation to the seafood matrix (poor in sugar and their metabolic activities should not change the initial characteristics of the product, i.e. by acidification, and not induce spoilage that could lead to a sensory rejection. Among the microbiota identified in fresh or processed seafood, LAB remains the category that offers the highest potential for direct application as a bioprotective culture or for bacteriocin production. Commercial applications and products There has been successful implementation of various phage preparation around the globe. Various applications/delivery methods in food have been developed. Bacteriophages and their endolysins can be incorporated into food systems in several ways such as spraying, dipping or immobilization, singly or in combination with other hurdles. The phage preparation LMP-1O2 has been subsequently commercialized as \\"ListShield\\" Intralyx, Inc. It has been shown to be effective against 170 different strains of \\"L. monocytogenes\\", reducing significantly (10 to 1000-fold) the Listeria contamination when sprayed onto ready-to-eat foods, without changing the food general composition, taste, odor or color. The Intralytix company has also commercialized phage-based antimicrobial preparations like SalmoFresh and SalmoLyse for controlling S. enterica. SalmoFresh is prepared with a cocktail of naturally occurring lytic bacteriophages that selectively and specifically kill Salmonella, including strains belonging to the most common/highly pathogenic serotypes Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Newport, Hadar, Kentucky and Thompson. According to the manufacturer, SalmoFresh is specifically designed for treating foods that are at high risk for \\"Salmonella\\" contamination. In particular, red meat and poultry can be treated prior to grinding for significant reductions in Salmonella contamination. SalmoLyse is a reformulated phage cocktail derived from SalmoFresh in which two of the six phages in the original cocktail have been replaced. Additional bacteriophage preparations have been formulated and referenced to be used to reduce the microbial load of animals prior to slaughter and are commercially available from Omnilytics such as the BacWash product line against Salmonella Omnilytics. Another commercial application has been developed, Listex_ P100 by Micreos in The Netherlands and was granted generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status by the FDA and USDA for use in all food products. Another significant commercial bacteriophage application is ELICOSALI, a wide range of anti- Salmonella and \\"E. coli\\" phage cocktail, for treatment of agricultural products developed by Eliava Institute at Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia Eliava Institute. Safety Biopreservation judiciously exploits the antimicrobial potential of naturally occurring microorganisms in food and/or their metabolites with a long history of safe use. Bacteriocins, bacteriophages and bacteriophage-encoded enzymes fall in this theory. The long and traditional role of Lactic acid bacteria on food and feed fermentations is the main factor related to the use of bacteriocins in biopreservation. LAB and their bacteriocins have been consumed unintentionally for ages, laying down a long history of safe use. Their antimicrobial spectrum of inhibition, bactericidal mode of action, relative tolerance to processing conditions (pH, NaCl, heat treatments) and the lack of toxicity towards eukaryotic cells enforces their role as biopreservatives in food. The evaluation of any new antimicrobial actives is done in meat by USDA which relies on the GRAS assessment by FDA among other suitability data.

It operated two RBMK reactors at Ignalina nuclear power plant which were shut down in 2004 and 2009. History In Lithuania in 1978, construction began on two RBMK reactors (1,380 MWe net) with 30-year lives for the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The light-water, graphite-moderated reactors were of similar design as those at Chernobyl. The nuclear power plant began operating in 1983. The first reactor was decommissioned in 2004 and the second one in 2009. Originally, Lithuania built these reactors to export electricity to its neighbours, with 42% of electricity exported in 1989. This number fell through the 1990s as domestic demand increased.“Nuclear Power in Lithuania.” World Nuclear Association. February 2008. < > In 1994, Lithuania accepted US$36.8 million from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's Nuclear Safety Account to improve safety at the Ignalina site. Under the grant, both the reactors had to be closed within 15–20 years. Moreover, in order to join the EU, Lithuania had to decommission one reactor immediately and the second by 2009. The EU agreed to pay for decommissioning costs and some compensation through 2013. Strong public opposition followed, because of fear for electricity price hikes. In 2006, Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian power companies carried out the feasibility study for construction of the new nuclear power plant in Lithuania to replace existing Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, scheduled to be shut down in 2009. The study shows that the nuclear power plant project is feasible. The Radioactive Waste Management Agency, established in 2001, is responsible for disposal of all radioactive waste from Ignalina during operation and decommissioning. A site near the plant has been identified for storage of low and intermediate-level waste. According to the World Nuclear Association, the Lithuanian government is in the process of building a permanent repository, to be completed in 2015. On 14 October 2012 an advisory referendum on constructing a new nuclear plant found 62.7% of the participating Lithuanian electorate against and 34.1% for. In 2016 the instigator of the Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant new build proposal, former energy minister Arvydas Sekmokas, said the proposal was \\"dead\\".

In 2018, nuclear power produces approximately 55% of the country’s electricity. Three older reactors have been shut down. The government of Slovakia is committed to nuclear power, and two more reactors have been under construction at Mochovce since 1987. Prior to its accession to the European Union, Slovakia had to shut down two of its older reactors at Bohunice, because they did not meet European safety standards. Although Slovakia spent significant effort to achieve WANO standards, the EU insisted on the shutdowns. The first plant closed 31 December 2006 and the second on 31 December 2008. The closure of these units, prior to the completion of two new reactors has left the country short on power and Slovakia became an energy importer after the first plant was shut down. Within the EU, Slovakia is one of the pro-nuclear Visegrád Group nations.http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2013-10/14/content_30291509.htmhttp://nuclearpower.einnews.com/region/visegrad- group The two under construction reactors at Mochovce will have a net electrical capacity of 440 MW each. Enel, an Italian power company and a majority shareholder of the Slovak power company, initially planned an investment of €1.6 billion for the completion of the Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant units 3 and 4 by 2011–2012. In January 2006 the Slovak government approved a new energy strategy incorporating these plans, with capacity uprates at Mochovce NPP units 1 and 2, and at Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant units 3 and 4.  Waste disposal and decommissioning  Radioactive waste in Slovakia is disposed without reprocessing. The spent fuel stays at the reactor site; however, some spent fuel has been exported to Russia. Slovakia has also begun a search for a high-level waste repository and established a fund with approximately €775 million to build it. At Bohunice, two reactors of the V1 plant have been deactivated. The total cost of decommission and dismantling of Bohunice V1 by 2025 is estimated at €1.14 billion. The first reactor pressure vessel was removed from Bohunice V1 on June 3, 2020. It is the first decommissioning of a VVER 440 plant to be completed. The process was completed amid health and safety regulations in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Background  It is not known when Liu Jianfeng was born, but it is known that he was from Langshan (朗山, in modern Zhumadian, Henan).New Book of Tang, vol. 190. At some point, he became an officer at Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan) and was stationed at Cai Prefecture (蔡州, in modern Zhumadian), which Langshan belonged to, as part of the effort to resist the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, serving alongside his Zhongwu Circuit colleague Sun Ru, and both served under Qin Zongquan the military governor of Fengguo Circuit (奉國, headquartered at Cai Prefecture). They continued to serve under Qin after Qin had rebelled against the rule of Emperor Xizong and declared himself emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.  Service under Sun Ru  In 886, Qin Zongquan put Sun Ru in command of an army to attack Tang's Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan); Sun prevailed over the acting military governor of Heyang, Zhuge Zhongfang (), and took over the circuit. Despite the victory, Zhang Ji (), who also served under Sun, secretly stated to Liu Jianfeng, \\"Lord Qin is harsh and paranoid, and will soon be destroyed. We have to find a way to avoid this fate ourselves.\\" Liu, who saw the wisdom in Zhang's words, befriended him. Sun subsequently withdrew from Heyang after Qin suffered a major defeat at the hands of Zhu Quanzhong the Tang military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Later in the year, Qin sent his brother Qin Zongheng (), with Sun as his deputy, to advance into Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), to contend for control of the circuit, which by that point had fallen into an internecine struggle between Qin Yan and Bi Shiduo on one side, and Yang Xingmi on the other. Liu, Zhang, and Ma Yin were all in this army commanded by Qin Zongheng. When they arrived at Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (), Yang Xingmi had captured it and forced Qin Yan and Bi to flee. Qin Yan and Bi then joined forces with Qin Zongheng as well. Soon thereafter, when Qin Zongquan, himself facing military pressure from Zhu, tried to recall Qin Zongheng's army, Sun assassinated Qin Zongheng and took over the army, thereafter executing Qin Yan and Bi. Sun soon defeated Yang Xingmi and took over Yang Prefecture, claiming the title of military governor of Huainan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. (Yang subsequently took Ningguo Circuit (寧國, headquartered in modern Xuanzhou, Anhui and became its military governor.) In 889, Sun had Liu attack and capture Chang (常州, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu) and Run (潤州, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) from Yang Xingmi's subordinate Tian Jun and Cheng Ji (), a subordinate of Qian Liu (who then controlled Hang Prefecture (杭州, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang), respectively. In 890, by which time Chang Prefecture had again been taken by Yang Xingmi and was defended by Yang Xingmi's subordinate Zhang Xingzhou (), Liu again captured it and killed Zhang, and then put Su Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), then under the control of Yang Xingmi's subordinate Li You (), under siege. Sun subsequently captured Su Prefecture himself and killed Li.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In spring 891, Sun launched the initial phase of an ambitious plan to first destroy Yang Xingmi and then Zhu. He took all of the army available to him and headed for Xuanshe's capital Xuan Prefecture (). Liu was part of Sun's army. Sun's army was initially victorious, and by spring 892 had put Xuan Prefecture under siege. However, Sun was unable to capture Xuan, and soon got bogged down, with Yang sending raiders to cut off his food supplies. Further, his army was soon troubled by torrential floods and illnesses, and Sun himself was suffering from malaria. He was forced to send Liu and Ma out to raid the nearby regions for food. Meanwhile, Yang, hearing that Sun was suffering from malaria, attacked. He crushed Sun's army and killed Sun. Most of Sun's soldiers surrendered to Yang. Liu and Ma took 7,000 soldiers and headed south, toward Zhennan Circuit (鎮南, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangsi); the soldiers supported Liu as their leader, with Ma as his forward commander and Zhang Ji as his strategist. The army's size eventually ballooned to over 100,000.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259.  Seizure of Wu'an Circuit  Instead of attacking Zhennan Circuit, Liu Jianfeng's army continued to head southwest, toward Wu'an Circuit, which was then ruled by Deng Chuna. When Liu reached Liling (醴陵, in modern Zhuzhou, Hunan) in summer 894, Deng sent his subordinates Jiang Xun () and Deng Jichong () to defend Longhui Pass (龍回關, in modern Shaoyang, Hunan) against Liu's advance. Ma Yin advanced to the pass and sent a messenger to Jiang and Deng Jichong. The messenger persuaded Jiang and Deng Jichong that Liu's arrival was foretold by the stars and that their army would be unable to resist his. At the suggestion of the messenger, Jiang and Deng Jichong disbanded their army. Liu then had his soldiers put on the uniforms that Jiang's and Deng Jichong's army wore, and then quickly advanced to Wu'an's capital Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan). When they arrived there, the Tan Prefecture's defenders mistook them for Jiang's and Deng Jichong's army, and therefore took no precautions. Liu's army directly headed for the headquarters, where Deng Chuna was holding a feast. They captured Deng Chuna, and Liu executed him and claimed the title of acting military governor. In summer 895, then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong commissioned Liu as the military governor of Wu'an.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260.  Death  In winter 895, after Jiang Xun's request to be the prefect of Shao Prefecture (邵州, in modern Shaoyang) was rebuffed by Liu Jianfeng, he and Deng Jichong rose to oppose Liu. They quickly captured Shao Prefecture and tried to pressure Tan Prefecture. In spring 896, Liu sent Ma Yin to attack Jiang and Deng, and Ma had initial successes. However, while this campaign was still going on, it was said that Liu had become arrogant and alcoholic after he took over the circuit. He also carried on an affair with the beautiful wife of his officer Chen Shan (). Chen, angry, used a hammer to assassinate Liu. The soldiers initially supported Zhang Ji to succeed Liu, but Zhang declined and eventually supported Ma.

Biography  Steve Gluzband was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts to Frank and Rita Gluzband. His father's family had emigrated from Havana, Cuba whereas his mother's family had been in Boston since the 1880s. At age twelve, Gluzband began playing the accordion and was soon earning money as a solo act, but switched to trumpet at age 14 due to his growing interest in jazz. Gluzband graduated from the prestigious Boston Latin School and received a bachelor's degree from Boston's Berklee School of Music, where he studied with swing trumpet legend Lennie Johnson (Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Quincy Jones). While attending Berklee, Gluzband performed and toured the east coast with various show bands, but upon seeing a performance of Celia Cruz and Johnny Pacheco in 1975, Gluzband realized it was only a matter of time before he would move to New York City with the intention of playing and recording with the various bands signed with Fania Records. Gluzband also studied Private Composition with George Russell and Jazz Improvisation with Jaki Byard.  Career  = Recordings and concerts = Shortly after arriving in New York in 1979, Gluzband joined the popular salsa band “Saoco”. During the next few years he played numerous gigs with latin superstars Tito Puente, Mongo Santamaría, Héctor Lavoe, Machito, Celia Cruz, Sonora Matancera, Orlando Contreras, Vicentico Valdez, Ray de la Paz, Larry Harlow, the Alegre All Stars and recorded 18 albums with the famous Haitian recording group Mini All-Stars. During this period, Gluzband studied privately with Dr. Donald S. Reihnardt in Philadelphia, Pa. Steven became a member of the Ray Barretto Orchestra, where he remained for 20 years, recording three albums with Ray for Fania. While a member of Barretto's group, Gluzband toured Europe, North, South and Latin America dozens of times, appearing at the North Sea Festival and at Montreux Jazz Festival as well as major jazz venues throughout Europe and the Americas. During his tenure with Barretto, Gluzband appeared on over 250 recordings, including the Grammy-winning Ritmo en el Corazon (Barretto-Celia Cruz, 1988) and Naked (Talking Heads, 1988). In the mid 1990s, Gluzband was an integral part of the short-lived swing revival, touring with Jet Set Six, and playing with Dem Brooklyn Bums, the Blues Jumpers and Dave's True Story. At the close of the century, Gluzband became a member of the Jimmy Bosch band.

The route begins at an intersection with VT 11 in the town of Springfield and runs along the Black River for several miles, crossing through Weathersfield, Reading and Woodstock before reaching the village of Woodstock, where it ends at a junction with U.S. Route 4 (US 4).  Route description  VT 106 begins at a forked intersection with VT 11 (River Street / Chester Road) in the town of Springfield. VT 106 proceeds northwest as River Street, running along the shores of the Black River, past St. Mary's Oakland Cemetery as a two-lane commercial road. Crossing through an industrial section of Springfield, the route crosses over the Black River, which turns to the northeast near Main Street NS. After crossing the Black River, the River Street moniker is dropped, and the route turns west just south of Hartness State Airport. At the end of the western turn, VT 106 turns north while its former right-of-way becomes VT 10, which begins at the intersection. VT 106 continues north through Springfield, passing multiple residences on both sides and reaching a junction with Airport Road, which connects back to Hartness State. VT 106 at VT 131 in Weathersfield VT 106 crosses into Weathersfield, continuing north past multiple residences and soon reaching the village of Perkinsville. In Perkinsville, VT 106 becomes the main north-south thoroughfare, passing multiple residences before crossing over the Black River once again. Paralleling the river, VT 106 makes a gradual bend north out of downtown Perkinsville, running north into the village of Downers, where it intersects with VT 131. Continuing north, VT 106 parallels the North Branch of the Black River, bending to the northwest through Weathersfield into the village of Greenbush, which consists of a junction with Ascutney Basin Road. Continuing along the branch, the route crosses into the town of Cavendish and soon into Reading.

The production of electricity for the Irish national grid (Eirgrid), by nuclear fission, is prohibited in the Republic of Ireland by the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (Section 18). The enforcement of this law is only possible within the borders of Ireland, and it does not prohibit consumption. Since 2001 in Northern Ireland and 2012 in the Republic, the grid has become increasingly interconnected with the neighbouring electric grid of Britain, and therefore Ireland is now partly powered by overseas nuclear fission stations.https://web.archive.org/web/20140721003556/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/DD9FFC79-E1A0-41AB- BB6D-27FAEEB4D643/0/DCENRGreenPaperonEnergyPolicyinIreland.pdf page 50 A ‘Eurobarometer’ survey in 2007 indicated that 27 percent of the citizens of Ireland were in favour of an “increased use” of nuclear energy. As of 2014, a Generation IV nuclear station was envisaged in competition with a biomass burning facility to succeed Ireland's single largest source of greenhouse gases, the coal burning Moneypoint power station, when it retires, c. 2025.https://web.archive.org/web/20140721003556/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/DD9FFC79-E1A0-41AB- BB6D-27FAEEB4D643/0/DCENRGreenPaperonEnergyPolicyinIreland.pdf page 50 to 60 In 2015 a National Energy Forum was founded to decide upon generation mixes to be deployed in the Republic of Ireland, out to 2030. This forum has yet to be convened (Oct 2016). Electricity security In 2014 Ireland presently sources about 70% of its electricity from fossil gas. The primary source (\\"95%\\") of this gas to Ireland is via the moffat-Isle of man- Gormanstown/\\"Dublin\\" connection and to a lesser extent, the Scotland-Northern Ireland pipeline (SNIP), both of these pipes are, in of themselves, connected to the wider British pipe-network and the European continent Dutch-British network. This great network of pipes is supplied with North Sea Gas and as that source is drying up, a greater dependence is expected on the frequently disrupted European gas network for which Russia being a primary provider. Carnsore Point A nuclear power plant was proposed in 1968, and resulted in the creation of the Nuclear Energy Board. It was to be built during the 1970s at Carnsore Point in County Wexford by the Electricity Supply Board. The plan envisioned four reactors to be built at the site, but was dropped in 1981 after strong opposition from anti-nuclear lobby groups throughout the 1970s, particularly in 1978 with concerts and rallies being held at Carnsore Point attended by popular musician Christy Moore. The intended generating capacity of the planned station was therefore required to be sourced from other energy sources, and such, the construction of the coal burning Moneypoint power station began in 1979. Fission electricity enters Ireland Following the completion of the HVDC Moyle cable in 2001, connecting Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the larger capacity 500 MW East-West Interconnector in 2012, a submarine cable that connects County Dublin with Wales, Ireland has been supported with electricity from the generation of the Welsh Wylfa fission- electric power station and fission electricity in Britain as a whole. The Wylfa power stations is however shuttered,IAEA PRIS the last reactor shut down in 2015. Ireland was a net exporter of electricity in 2016 and 2017.Energy in Ireland 2018 Report, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) Revived interest Forfás in 2006, the 120-member Irish Academy of Engineering in 2011Energy Policy and Economic Recovery 2010-2015 , page 5. Irish Academy of Engineering, 2011. Archive and more recently, the National Energy Forum in 2015, have suggested that a Generation IV reactor should be considered for analysis in Ireland's energy future. In April 2006, a government-commissioned report by Forfás pointed to the need for Ireland to reconsider nuclear power in order \\"to secure its long-run energy security\\". A relatively small-scale, Generation IV nuclear station was envisaged. In 2007, Ireland's Electricity Supply Board made it known that it would consider a joint venture with a major European Union energy company to build nuclear capacity. A 2012 International Energy Agency (IEA) report said that Ireland is highly dependent on imported oil and natural/fossil gas. While the push to develop renewable energies is commendable, it will result in an increased reliance on fossil gas, as gas- fired power plants will be required to provide flexibility in electricity supply when wind power is unavailable. About 60% of Ireland's electricity already comes from gas-fired generation, which adds to energy security concerns, particularly as 93% of its gas supplies come from a single transit point in Scotland. In 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency in Ireland warned that Ireland is not on track to meet its 2020 pollution reductions of greenhouse gases. As there is a need to replace the coal burning 900 MW Moneypoint power station, situated in the South West of Ireland, a station which will approach its design life in 2025 and until then it will remain as Ireland's primary emitter of greenhouse gases. A dependable baseload power source with a high capacity factor will be required to keep the grid stable in its absence, a role that is now being filled by Moneypoint station, this role will thus need to be filled by a low carbon power station to mitigate climate change. As of 2014, a Generation IV nuclear station was envisaged in competition with a biomass burning facility to succeed Moneypoint. In 2015 a National Energy Forum was envisaged to decide on generation mixes to be deployed in Ireland out to 2030, as of July 2016 this forum has not been convened. Celtic interconnector In 2016 proposals for a $1 billion Irish- French subsea cable, with a capacity for 700 MW, close to the 900 MW output of Moneypoint, were discussed between both countries. With over 70% of French electricity generated from its fleet of fission-electric reactors, if connected, Ireland would further receive electricity from overseas nuclear energy suppliers, with the commencement of construction suggested for 2021, the Celtic Interconnector is expected to be completed by 2025. It would then become Ireland's only connection to an EU member state, following the withdrawal of the UK, in Brexit.http://www.eirgridgroup.com/the- grid/projects/celtic-interconnector/the-project/ Nuclear fusion As with the other members of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), Ireland funds nuclear fusion energy research, including the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, now known simply as the ITER project, with the Irish contribution being managed by the National Centre for Plasma Science & Technology at Dublin City University. Donegal uranium prospecting ISL is primarily conducted on copper ore bodies which bring up uranium ore as a co- product. In 2007, the Green party which were the political architects behind the 1999 prohibition in the Republic of Ireland of the generation of fission- electricity, further prohibited the granting of exploration contracts to 2 unnamed mineral prospecting companies, which were requesting to explore the west of county Donegal.Archive map of areas requested for exploration The then energy minister, the Green party's Eamon Ryan, signaled he was denying the exploration licenses as he is \\"against\\" nuclear energy. Ryan has also stated that \\"It would be hypocritical to permit the extraction of uranium for use in nuclear reactors in other countries, while the nuclear generation of electricity is not allowed in Ireland\\". The suggested mining method of In-situ liquid extraction of underground uranium, was deemed the most likely had the prospecting developed into a mining license. Ireland is a member state signatory to the Nuclear Exporters Committee, which requires indigenous exploration and processing companies conduct all uranium-ore extraction and handling. The international committee monitors the exporting of process knowledge and techniques and therefore requires each member state to indigenously develop the processing techniques and manufacture all the equipment that relate to natural uranium ore, within its own borders.

His accusations focused on images in the Lolicon and pedophilia categories, the latter of which contained explicit drawings of sexual acts between adults and children by French artist Martin van Maele (1863–1926).Riegler, Birgit (18 May 2010). \\"Fox News spinnt Pornostreit zur Anti-Wikipedia-Kampagne\\", Der Standard. Shortly after Sanger posted the letter in public, criticism came in from multiple sources. This ranged from assertions that he had mislabeled lolicon as child pornography to the contention that his actions were an attack on the Wikimedia Foundation, caused by his history with Wikipedia and his own competing online encyclopedia, Citizendium. Sanger denied that the letter was an attempt to undermine Wikipedia, but did confirm it was an attempt to force a policy change for labeling or eliminating \\"adult\\" content on Wikipedia. Things escalated when Fox News began reporting on the issue. In response Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, and other administrators began deleting images en masse, with Fox News reporting that a new policy change was underway. Days later Wales voluntarily relinquished his administrative powers on Commons under heavy criticism from the Wikimedia community. Fox News also received criticism for its handling of the reporting, especially for misrepresenting the situation regarding the self removal of administrative powers by Wales as leaving the Foundation without clear leadership. Reporting On April 7, 2010, Larry Sanger sent a letter to the FBI, United States Senators, and Representatives saying that Wikimedia Commons hosted child pornography in the lolicon and pedophilia categories. He later acknowledged that the term \\"child pornography\\" may have been misleading because to many people it denotes images of real children and said that with the benefit of hindsight, he would have used the phrase \\"depictions of child sexual abuse\\" instead. According to section 1466A(2)(A) of Title 18 of the United States Code, \\"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\\" can be \\"a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting\\", and anyone who \\"knowingly produces, distributes, receives, or possesses with intent to distribute, a visual depiction\\" of this kind is subject to legal penalties.Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 71, § 1466A Section 1466 specifically states, \\"It is not a required element of any offense under this section that the minor depicted actually exist.\\" Media in the Wikimedia Commons pedophilia category include graphic drawings of child sexual abuse by French illustrator Martin van Maele. Sanger's opinion was that the content violated section 1466A(2)(A), although the Wikimedia Foundation might argue that the media were exempted per section 1466A(2)(B), which refers to image that have \\"serious literal, artistic, political, or scientific value\\". Sanger referred to an online discussion between educational technologists reporting that filtering software was not picking up the images, making them accessible to children in schools, and stated that this discussion was what first made him aware of the issue. Sanger said that he felt both morally and legally obligated to report the presence of these media, because the statutes implied that once aware of such content, one had to do so or risk prosecution oneself. Wikimedia's responses Mike Godwin, general counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation, dismissed Sanger's claims. Godwin said that Sanger committed a typical layman's error in trying to invoke statutory law without adequate research, confusing several sections of Title 18. Section 1466A, the section invoked by Sanger, does not deal with child pornography, but with obscenity, while child pornography is addressed in section 2252. Godwin further defended the Foundation by citing Miller v. California which, according to The Register, emphasizes \\"the importance of community standards in defining what qualifies as obscenity\\". He also pointed out that the Foundation's projects are created by web users, and cited section 230 of the Communications Decency Act – something he notes U.S. Federal obscenity and child-pornography statutes make a similar exception for. Wikipedian spokesman Jay Walsh said that the Foundation does not harbor illegal material and any such material uploaded by volunteers would be removed. Sanger's response Sanger, a self-ascribed libertarian and moralist, stood by his actions and said, \\"pretending that it's just obvious, even for libertarians, that we have a right to publish such depictions is simply wrong, in my opinion\\". He told The Register, \\"If I [did]n't report this – and it's been up for years, apparently – who will? As the co-founder of the project, I believe I have a special personal obligation to rein in egregious wrongdoing when I see it. Or at least try. It bothers me that something I helped start has come to this.\\" After the report, several allegations were made against Sanger and picked up by sites such as Slashdot: that this was an attempt to destroy the Wikimedia Foundation; that there was a conflict of interest in his reporting; and that he listed his own websites in the letter, among others. In response to his actions being seen as an attempt by him to destroy the Wikimedia Foundation Sanger commented that this was not true, although he hoped that by making things public the Foundation could be forcibly persuaded to eliminate or label content as \\"adult\\", so that filtering software would pick it up and more schools would allow Wikipedia. On the allegations that the reporting was a conflict of interest Sanger comments that, while he once worked for Wikipedia and was currently running a site in competing against it, the reporting probably did more harm to his personal career. He also contends that he was required by law to make the report, although the manner in which he chose to do so was not. Sanger also responded to one specific comment on Slashdot, In his response Sanger said he found the response chilling and disparaged the community for rating the comment as \\"Score: 5, Interesting\\". Sanger goes on to criticize the industry by stating, Image purge On May 7, 2010, after Fox News had begun informing and putting pressure on dozens of companies that donate to the Wikimedia Foundation, they reported that the Wikimedia Foundation had begun purging its websites of thousands of pornographic images after co-founder of the Wikimedia Foundation Jimmy Wales had been contacted by several of those donors. Fox News also reported that, according to Wales, this was in preparation for a new policy regarding sexually explicit content. However, Wales later denied the shake-up and that the reporter had ever contacted him. The purge led to infighting throughout the entire Wikimedia community. Contributors complained that the deletions were \\"undemocratic and taken too quickly\\" and could result in images with legitimate educational value being accidentally deleted. Fox News claimed that the situation quickly \\"devolved into an all-out war pitting board members against board members, and with top leadership sparring with lower level administrators\\". However, the Wikimedia Foundation responded that, while discussions had become intense, it was a normal part of the process. On May 9, 2010, Jimmy Wales gave up some site privileges in response to protests by contributors who were angered over his deletion of images without consultation. He can no longer delete files, remove administrators, assign projects or edit protected content; however, he is still able to edit as a regular user. Wales had previously asked that such images be removed. Some of the images he and other administrators deleted were restored as they were deemed to have educational value. His stepping down was picked up by various media when Fox News quoted a source as saying that Wales' voluntary redaction of his administrative powers created \\"chaos\\" with no one clearly in charge. The Foundation later denied those claims and posted a response on their blog about co-founder Wales' role in the Wikimedia Foundation. They clarified Wales' position as Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees, noting that there were other executives with higher authority. =Sanger's relations with Wikimedia= Sanger is one of the co-founders of Wikipedia, but resigned on March 1, 2002. In September 2006 he founded Citizendium, a competitor to Wikipedia. While Sanger has gone on the record that this was not an attack on Wikipedia, nor a way to boost readership of his own free web-based collaborative encyclopedia, there is a significant level of skepticism that Sanger acted without malice. Sanger has had an antagonistic history against Wikipedia since leaving, including criticism of Wikipedia co-founder Wales, and of the Wikipedia community: \\"The ... community had essentially been taken over by trolls to a great extent. That was a real problem, and Jimmy Wales absolutely refused to do anything about it.\\" = Criticism of Fox News coverage= Fox News was criticized for its handling of their reporting. In The Guardian, Godwin criticized the network, stating that Fox's releases were \\"part of its 'self-congratulatory anti-porn-on-the-Internet campaign. Techdirt also criticized them for their lack of transparency, stating, \\"While Fox [News] of course plays up Sanger's Wikipedia credentials, they leave out the fact that he has been working on a failed competitor for years (they mention the company name, but not that it's a competitor). They also leave out much of the animosity between Sanger and Wikipedia.\\" Fox News also improperly reported that Wales had a higher position in the Wikimedia Foundation and that his leaving caused a power vacuum. Wales said that the Fox News reporter, Jana Winter, who wrote the article on the alleged stepping down had never contacted him before publishing the article.

The older Dodewaard nuclear power plant was a test reactor that was later attached to the national grid but was closed in 1997. A 2MW research reactor is located in Delft, as part of the physics department of Delft University of Technology. This reactor is not meant for energy provision, but is used as a neutron- and positron-source for research. History Researchers in the Netherlands began studying nuclear energy in the 1930s and began the construction of research reactor at Dodewaard in 1955. The researchers’ goal was to introduce nuclear power technology by 1962 and replace fossil fuels. In 1968, a test nuclear reactor was attached to the power grid. This unit was shut down in 1997. In the 1970s, the Dutch chose a policy that required reprocessing all spent nuclear fuel. In 1984, the government decided to create a long-term (100 years) storage facility for all intermediate and low-level radioactive waste and research strategies for ultimate disposal. In September 2003, the Central Organization for Radioactive Waste created an interim storage facility for high-level waste. In 1994, the Netherlands' parliament voted to phase out nuclear power after a discussion of nuclear waste management. In 1997, the power station at Dodewaard was shut down and the government planned to end Borssele's operating license in 2003. In 2003, with a new government in power, the shutdown was postponed to 2013. In 2006 the government decided that Borssele would remain open until 2034, if it complied with the highest safety standards. The owners, Essent and Delta, will invest 500 million euro in sustainable energy, together with the government—money which the government claims otherwise should have been paid to the plants' owners as compensation. After the 2010 election, the new government was open to expanding nuclear power. Both of the companies that share ownership of Borssele are proposing to build new reactors. In January 2012, Delta announced the postponing of any decision to start building a second nuclear power plant. In November 2018, a majority of the Dutch parliament supported the construction of new nuclear power plants. In November 2019, an opinion poll found that 61% of Dutch voters are in favor of the installation of new nuclear plants in the Netherlands, with a noticeable discrepancy between right- and left-wing voters.

The film stars Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna, Dimple Kapadia, Amrita Singh, Poonam Dhillon, Shammi Kapoor, Mohsin Khan and Amrish Puri.  Plot  Sumer and Vikram are two close friends, whose close bond is well known in the village. Sumer belongs to lower caste and serves as a cop. Vikram belongs to upper cast Thakurs, who are landlords. The film is set post-independence and a new land sealing law is drafted by the Government, which states that individuals cannot own land beyond a certain limit. This is a big blow to the Thakurs, since they own hundreds of acres of land. As per the new law, they would have surrender the excess land to the government, which would be distributed to the farmers. The Bade Thakur and his eldest son Deven cannot come to terms with this new change. Deven plans a plot, in which he will distribute the land amongst their relatives by back dating the transaction dates. For this they would need signature / thumb impressions of the farmers who are tilling the land (the land is mortgaged to the Thakurs). The Sarpanch (Village Head) is on their side and agrees to help in manipulating the records as well as convincing the farmers to give their approval. They have a meeting, wherein the farmers are adamant on sticking with their land. A heated argument leads to Deven getting panicked and shooting from his rifle, killing one villager. This infuriates the rest and the mob lynch him. Vikram rushes back to his village to perform last rites of his brother. He cannot bear the pain of the loss of his brother and sets off towards the dwellings of the farmer with his rifle. He kills many farmers and sets fire to their home. From there, he escapes to the ravines and joins the bandits. Vikram gets his gang, in return the bandits get money and protection from the influential Thakur family. Meanwhile, Vikram's youngest brother Rajendra who is also a cop, returns to his village. He is disappointed to see that his brother has turned bandit. His father urges him to protect Vikram from the law and exact revenge from the villagers who have defied their supremacy. Rajendra true to his vow as a cop, refuses to do this. When Sumer returns to his village, he cannot come to terms with what has happened and is deeply anguished that his best friend has done it. He marries his love interest Jina immediately, since she is orphaned as her brother was killed by Vikram. Sumer meets Vikram and declare that this is the end of their friendship. Meanwhile, Bade Thakur (Vikram's Dad) invites Hanumant Thakur (Rajendra's Junior Cop) to suppress the rebellion led by Sumer. Hanumant says that his hands are tied by his boss Rajendra. Bade Thakur arranges for his transfer and Hanumant takes charge from Rajendra. He then releases a reign of terror. In one such incident he kicks pregnant Jina, which causes miscarriage. This infuriates Sumer and he attacks the police station, kills all the cops and assumes that Hanumant has also died, but he survives. He loots the arsenal from the police and distributes it to the villagers. Now Sumer also turns a bandit and joins with the rival gang of Vikram. This gives rise to a game of cat and mouse. Sumer loots the granary of the Thakurs and Vikram loots the money they earned after selling the produce in the market. In response, Sumer loots the Haveli (Mansion) of the Thakurs. At this point, Rajendra is restored back to his position and takes charge of the situation. Vikram now plans to burn up the entire village. Meanwhile, Vikram's gang leader plots to get him killed in a police encounter by leaking this information to the police for a hefty price. As planned, Vikram arrives in the village, but is trapped by the police. He manages to escape, but most of his gang members are killed. Sumer plans to retaliate by raiding the Haveli of the Thakurs once more. It is now clear that there would be a major showdown between the two rivals. Rajendra gets to investigate the rebellion and comes across brutalities committed by Hanumant. He plans to get him and his accomplices suspended from the police force. Hanumant plans to eliminate Rajendra in the upcoming showdown between the two rivals. This is overheard by a cop, who relays this to Vikram. At this point, the two ladies (Sumer's wife and Vikram's wife) intervene. They reveal how the gang leaders of their respective gangs are betraying them for money. Sumer and Vikram now join hands, first eliminate the leaders of their respective gangs and then reach the designated point where the showdown is supposed to happen. The police are already present there and have trapped them well. They feign to surrender and kidnap Hanumant. Later, they rekindle their memories of childhood and kill Hanumant like a hunting a wild boar, meanwhile bullets are piercing their bodies like a cold hailstorm (just as they had described in one of their childhood memories).

As of 2019, Norway's now only remaining nuclear reactor left in operation, the Jeep II reactor at Kjeller, is shut down after more than 50 years of service. In 2020 it was estimated dismantling the Halden and Kjeller research reactors and restoring the sites to unrestricted use will cost about NOK20 billion (US$2 billion) and take 20 to 25 years. There has been discussions about the possible usage of nuclear energy, which is supported by some industry leaders. Statkraft together with Vattenfall, Fortum and the energy investment company Scatec announced plans to investigate building of a thorium-fueled power plant in 2007 which was never realized. In 2010, Aker Solutions purchased patents from Nobel Prize winning physicist Carlo Rubbia for the design of a proton accelerator-based thorium nuclear power plant, but was subsequently sold to Jacobs Engineering Group in 2011. In late 2012, Norway's privately owned Thor Energy, in collaboration with the government and Westinghouse, announced a four-year trial using thorium in an existing nuclear reactor.\\"Norway ringing in thorium nuclear New Year with Westinghouse at the party\\", Smartplanet, Nov. 23, 2012 See also *Institute for Energy Technology References ","title":"Nuclear energy in Norway"},{"id":"31196925","text":"Portrait of Arnulphy dated 1746 Admiral Thomas Mathews by Arnulphy, 1743 Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil by Arnulphy, 1750 Claude Arnulphy (1697 - 22 June 1786), also spelt Arnulphi, was a French painter, chiefly of portraits, based at Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. Early life Arnulphy is claimed to have been born either at Grenoble or at Lyons, but Aix is also a possibility.Louis Dimier, Les peintres Francais du dix-septieme siecle (Éditions G. van Oest, 1928), p. 301: \\"peut-être à Grenoble, peut-être à Lyon\\". He was the son of Charles Arnulphy, a painter at Paris, although originally from the County of Nice in the Italian Duchy of Savoy, by his father's marriage to Madeleine Prongey, and he spent his childhood years in the French capital city. He first trained as a painter in his father's studio, then went to Rome to study under Benedetto Luti (1666–1724), becoming principally a portrait artist.André Alauzen, La Peinture en Provence (Marseilles: éd. Jeanne Laffitte, 1987), pp. 101-102 Career Arnulphy established himself in the city of Aix in about 1722, where he enjoyed a long artistic career and where many of his works survive.Pierre Cabanne, Guide artistique de la France (1968), p. 487: \\"Claude Arnulphy, Lyonnais ou Grenoblois d'origine, arriva à Aix vers 1722; il fit de nombreux portraits et mourut en 1786, octogénaire.\\" He was the master of Jean-François Pierre Peyron,Philippe de Chennevières, Recherches sur la vie et les ouvrages de quelques peintres, vol. 1, p. 44 and Antoine Gibelin (1739–1813), another native of Aix, also began to study art under Arnulphy. His work has been compared with that of Hyacinthe Rigaud (1659–1743) and Nicolas de Largillière (1656–1746).Marion Harry Spielmann, The Magazine of Art, vol. 1 (1903), p. 369 His portrait of Thomas Mathews (pictured) is one of four surviving portraits he painted of officers of a Royal Navy fleet lying off Toulon between 1742 and 1744. Three of these are now in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.Basil Greenhill, The National Maritime Museum (1982), p. 74 In February 1732, Arnulphy married Marguerite Aubaye, and they had ten children, of whom seven were sons. However, only one child, according to different sources a son named Joseph or François Arnulphy (died 1825) survived childhood.Dimier, p. 305 In 1765, as the result of the Will of Honoré Armand de Villars, a new drawing school was established which became known as the Aix Drawing School (École de dessin d'Aix-en-Provence), with the painter Charles Marcel Aune as its first principal and Arnulphy as his deputy. In 1785, Aune resigned the headship of the school to travel to North America, and Arnulphy took over from him. However, being by then aged at least eighty-eight, he chose a successor in the shape of a much younger man, Jean-Antoine Constantin. Arnulphy also held various other public offices in Aix, including those of syndic and treasurer. He died on 22 June 1786 and was buried the next day in the Récollets cemetery at Aix.

In the 1980s, the Zarnowiec Nuclear Power Plant was under construction, but was abandoned on 4 September 1990. To this day, nuclear energy is a controversial topic in Poland. Around 95% of the nation's electricity is currently produced by burning coal (of which Poland has the EU's largest reserves) but with the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in 2006 the nuclear option was reviewed. A 2006 feasibility study suggested it optimal to build an 11.5 GWe capacity nuclear power plant. However, this proving unaffordable in the immediate future, Poland decided to build a 4.5 GWe nuclear power plant by 2030. In 2007, a draft energy policy proposed a 10 GWe nuclear capacity by 2030 to provide 10% of electricity. The deadline gives an estimated ten years for investment and construction and five years of public campaigning. In July 2006, Poland joined Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia to build a new nuclear power plant in Lithuania to replace the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant being shut down due to pressure from the EU. Poland would invest 22% with these other countries into the project, which would have been operational by 2015. The total costs of the project was to be EUR 6 billion. Poland was guaranteed to have 1,200 MWe from the power plant and has upgraded transmission capacity between Lithuania and Poland. After the nuclear project was abandoned, Lithuania instead became an importer of electricity from Poland. In a public opinion poll, 60% of the population supported construction of a nuclear power plant in Poland to reduce its dependence on foreign sources of energy. Additionally, 48% supported construction of a nuclear power plant in their neighborhood, citing local benefits that include lower energy costs. The popular Baltic Sea resort Mielno is one of three sites selected, however in February 2012, residents voted overwhelmingly against the plan. Some 94 percent of the 2,389 people who took part in a referendum opposed the plant and only 5 percent supported it. the Polish government was still considering whether the first nuclear power plant should be built, but following financing difficulties in May 2018 state-owned PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna, who would have carried out any build, decided to invest in offshore wind power first. As of 2020 Poland is planning to start construction of 1.5 GWe nuclear power plant by 2026 and have 6-9 GWe by 2043.

Through the use of satellite imagery, SSP provides an early warning system to deter mass atrocities in a given situation by focusing world attention and generating rapid responses to human rights and human security concerns taking place in that situation. Activities SSP currently produces reports on the state of the conflict in the border regions between Sudan and South Sudan. DigitalGlobe provides satellite imagery and analysis.

After narrowly avoiding an accident on the road, they stop at a motel in the (fictional) small town of Montgomery. Cameron goes for a midnight stroll and comes back to find his fiancée missing. After a quick search, Cameron calls the local police. Following the arrival of the police, Cameron attacks the motel owner out of frustration and the authorities arrest him. He later attempts to escape and is killed in a car crash. Beth later awakens naked in an abandoned warehouse, lying in a bath tub filled with ice and water.

Alone and afraid for her child, Beth wanders outside of the facility where she finds three other mothers who have also been kidnapped and had their unborn children surgically removed. The group finds another woman, barely alive, with her womb surgically opened, who declares her child to be \\"blue.\\" As the mothers search around, they discover that their babies are alive and locked in cages, with colored clips that are matched to a colored tag sewn inside their true mother's abdomen. The only way to match the mother to the child is to remove the tag from their abdomens, which will lead to death by blood loss. One of the mothers decides the only way to find out which baby is hers is to kill the other women, remove their tag, and find her baby through the process of elimination. One by one, the women are picked off by the crazed mother until Beth catches and fatally injures her. Before she dies, she threatens to drop the remaining tag down a hole unless Beth promises to take care of her baby as well. The woman dies and Beth takes the tag from her hand. She then uses the tags to find the color for her baby. As she returns to find that the babies are no longer in their crib cages, she is knocked out by an unknown assailant. Beth regains consciousness and finds herself chained to the floor.

It was written by Ian Brennan, directed by Carol Banker, and aired on Fox in the United States on April 19, 2011. It features the McKinley High glee club, New Directions, fundraising for a fellow extracurricular activity group by holding a benefit concert, while cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) attempts to thwart them. Thirteen guest stars appeared in the episode, including Gwyneth Paltrow in her final season two appearance. Several cast members returned after extended absences: Jessalyn Gilsig, Cheyenne Jackson and Stephen Tobolowsky as members of Sue's anti-New Directions \\"League of Doom\\", and Charice as student Sunshine Corazon. Four songs were covered and released as singles, and a fifth featured as a dance performance. Upon its initial airing, the episode was viewed by 9.80 million American viewers, and garnered a 3.8/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic. Critical commentary was generally negative. Reviewers generally disliked the storyline centered on the under-appreciation of student Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), though commended her performance of Aretha Franklin's \\"Ain't No Way\\". The episode's comedy moments attracted some praise, though the guest stars and League of Doom plot were ill-received, as was the cutting short of a solo by Jenna Ushkowitz, and a rendition of Adele's \\"Turning Tables\\" by Paltrow, which critics found inferior to the original. Plot Low on funds for an upcoming competition trip, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) suggests that the club members sell saltwater taffy to raise money. New Directions members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) reveal they are on the academic decathlon team, which is also having funding problems. Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) is the fourth, stand-in member, and proves surprisingly knowledgeable about cat diseases. Will's girlfriend, substitute teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow), suggests holding a benefit concert for the decathlon team instead of selling additional taffy. Former McKinley student Sunshine Corazon (Charice), who defected to rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, is awarded the closing number at the concert after promising to bring her six hundred Twitter followers. The intellectual skills of Brittany (Heather Morris, pictured) are highlighted in this episode. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) creates a \\"League of Doom\\", with members that include Will's ex-wife Terri Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig), Vocal Adrenaline coach Dustin Goolsby (Cheyenne Jackson), and former McKinley High teacher Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), to destroy the glee club. Tasked with breaking up Will and Holly, Dustin makes a failed attempt at seducing her. The targeted relationship begins to crumble anyway, when Will helps his former love Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) with her stress-worsened OCD, after she reveals that her husband Carl Howell has asked for an annulment. Former New Directions member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) attends the concert, accompanied by his boyfriend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss). They are confronted by closeted homophobic bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler), who is forced to back down by Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), in retribution for previously throwing a slushie in her face. Sunshine and her followers pull out of the concert on Dustin's orders, and Sandy and McKinley students Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), Azimio (James Earl) and Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter)—the only other members of the audience—heckle the glee club. Tina is reduced to tears by their booing; Mike fares better as the hecklers are given taffy to keep their mouths full. During the intermission, Holly talks with the three students about the hidden cost of insults and suggests they cheer as opposed to jeering, but they opt to leave instead. Holly performs Adele's \\"Turning Tables\\" to Will. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), who on the advice of Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) has spent the lead-up to the concert making outrageous demands on her fellow club members to gain greater respect from them, performs the final number: a powerhouse version of Aretha Franklin's \\"Ain't No Way\\". She wows a stoned Sandy, who donates some of his drug profits to fund the academic decathlon team. Holly takes a job in Cleveland, leaving Will free to pursue Emma, while Sue decides to bring Terri further into the game. The episode ends on the academic decathlon final's tiebreaker question, which is in the category \\"hermaphrodite Nazi sympathizers\\", a topic earlier taught in an irreverent history lesson by Holly. Production Thirteen guest stars were featured in \\"A Night of Neglect\\", including Paltrow, who made her third and final second season appearance as substitute teacher Holly Holliday, following \\"The Substitute\\" and \\"Sexy\\". Having previously appeared in the second season's first episode, Jackson and Charice also returned, as Vocal Adrenaline's Dustin and Sunshine, respectively. Additional recurring guest characters who appeared were New Directions members Mike Chang, Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) and Lauren Zizes, school bullies Dave Karofsky and Azimio, school reporter Jacob Ben Israel, cheerleader Becky Jackson, local news anchor Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones), and Blaine Anderson, lead singer of the Dalton Academy Warblers. The musical focus of the episode was, according to cast member Cory Monteith, \\"artists that may have been neglected or under-appreciated over the years\\". He revealed that the series' attempt to clear music licensing rights to a song by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk was complicated by the fact that she apparently did not have a telephone number. She eventually declined the request, as later revealed by Glee creator Ryan Murphy, because she felt the song would not have been appropriate to use in its proposed accompanying scene, but remained open to future suggestions as she mentioned that she had enjoyed the show. The songs covered in the episode were Aretha Franklin's \\"Ain't No Way\\" performed by Riley; Celine Dion's cover of Eric Carmen's \\"All by Myself\\" performed by Charice; Lykke Li's \\"I Follow Rivers\\", performed by Ushkowitz; and Adele's \\"Turning Tables\\", performed by Paltrow. This marks the second time \\"All by Myself\\", a song Charice previously performed in concert, was covered on the series, the first being in the first season episode \\"Showmance\\". Jack Johnson's \\"Bubble Toes\\" also featured in the episode, as a dance routine performed by Shum, Jr. All four vocal performances were released as digital singles, though only \\"All by Myself\\" and \\"Turning Tables\\" charted. The former peaked at number eighty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100, while the latter reached number sixty-six in both the US and Canada. Reception =Ratings= \\"A Night of Neglect\\" was first broadcast on April 19, 2011 in the United States. It garnered a 3.8/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, and received nearly 9.80 million American viewers during its initial airing. Viewership and ratings were down significantly from those of the previous episode, \\"Original Song\\", which was watched by 11.15 million American viewers and acquired a 4.2/13 rating/share in the 18-49 demographic upon first airing. It was the most-watched scripted show for the week of broadcast amongst adults aged 18–49, and ranked 16th amongst all viewers. The episode's Canadian broadcast, also on April 19, 2011, attained 1.74 million viewers and ranked ninth for the week. It registered a slight decline on \\"Original Song\\", which was viewed by 1.81 million, but also ranked ninth. In the UK, the episode was broadcast on May 2, 2011, and was watched by 2.44 million viewers (1.92 million on E4, and 520,000 on E4+1), becoming the most- watched show on E4 and E4 +1 for the week, and the third most-watched show on cable for the week. Broadcast on May 4, 2011 in Australia, the episode attained 943,000 viewers and ranked tenth for the night. =Critical response= \\"A Night of Neglect\\" received generally negative reviews. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone deemed it a \\"very predictable episode\\", which neglected to take risks with its musical numbers and left her with a \\"stale feeling\\". Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was confused by the message presented. She approved of the Will–Emma plot and Holly's departure, but was dismayed by the lack of Kurt and Blaine, and criticized Mercedes' storyline for its repetitive nature. The Washington Post Lisa de Moraes lambasted the League of Doom plot, which, she wrote, consisted of \\"[two characters] whom viewers will barely remember, one who is super creepy, and another who fans despised\\". She suggested that they were included for contractual, rather than storyline reasons, though lauded Jackson's talent for \\"steal[ing] every scene he's in.\\" Futterman also praised Jackson's \\"long-overdue return\\". CNN's Lisa Respers France said the episode failed to meet her expectations. She was concerned that Mercedes' plot may lead towards the character becoming unlikeable, and criticized Holly's sudden departure. Though she enjoyed Sunshine's return, seeing Kurt and Blaine at McKinley and Mercedes' solo, she noted \\"all of those moments were fleeting and only contributed to the uneven feel of the show.\\" Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times called it a \\"quirky mixed bag, packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional (or musical) oomph.\\". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club graded the episode \\"C\\". He suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of the show: the under-use of its supporting cast members, and the \\"maniacal behavior\\" of Sue. McNutt wrote, \\"not only was the execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst, but the growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary. This episode was not a step in the right direction so much as it was an escalator to nowhere: A week from now, the chances of any of this resonating in the show itself is slim to none.\\" He felt that Mercedes has become a prop, rather than a character, and criticized the episode for attributing her blame for the marginalization the writers have subjected her to. MTV's Aly Semigran enjoyed the comedy and conclusion of Holly's plot, in what she deemed a \\"pretty decent\\" episode, though found Charice's appearance extraneous. IGN's Robert Canning gave \\"A Night of Neglect\\" 8.5/10, and called it \\"a bright and funny installment\\". He too praised the comedy storylines, particularly the League of Doom plot and the academic decathlon scenes, as: \\"it's this type of off-topic shenanigans (read: not about fitting in or Rachel Berry becoming a star) that breathes refreshing life into Glee and keeps reminding us how funny and entertaining this series can be.\\" He was less impressed with the benefit concert, which he felt harmed the episode's pacing, and as with Gonzalez, found the nature of Mercedes' storyline repetitive. Musical performances The episode was criticized for, once again, cutting down a solo by Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz, pictured). Musical performance in the episode, which Entertainment Weekly Emily Exton observed failed to fit the \\"neglected\\" criteria, also attracted mixed reviews. Futterman wrote that Charice \\"pull[ed] out all the stops\\", with her cover of \\"All By Myself\\", which reached \\"power notes [that provided] a viable threat to Rachel and Mercedes' diva singing\\". The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez commended her vocal \\"control and efficiency belying her young age\\", Semigran called it a \\"stirring rendition\\", and Gonzalez gave it an \\"A\\", her joint highest grade of the episode. Her second \\"A\\" was awarded to \\"Bubble Toes\\", which she called \\"one of the best [performances] of the season.\\" Semigran concurred, \\"[Mike's] dancing is awesome.\\" Critics disapproved of the continuing trend for cutting short Tina's solos. Gonzalez gave her rendition of \\"I Follow Rivers\\" a \\"B\\" and commented: \\"Will Tina ever get to finish a song? Well, judging by the 20 seconds we saw, she certainly deserves to.\\" Futterman called her performance \\"mostly spot-on\\", and TVLine Michael Slezak pointed out: \\"Why is it that every time Tina sings—remember her sobbing \\"My Funny Valentine\\"—things end weirdly? I wish we'd gotten a little more vocal and a little less booing in an episode about the club's underappreciated talents.\\" Exton suggested, \\"Maybe she'll get a chance to do a non-comedic relief song in its entirety by season 5?\\" Flandez disliked her performance; he commented that she sounded \\"like a flailing white swan, a poor man's Bjork.\\" Holly's performance of \\"Turning Tables\\" was considered inferior to the original. Futterman named it her least-favorite of Paltrow's covers to date and said that her vocals \\"lacked the texture that made Adele's version so heartbreaking.\\" Gonzalez gave it her lowest grade of the episode, a \\"B–\\", and Semigran opined that while Paltrow is \\"a nice enough singer,\\" she \\"in no way has the chops\\" the song requires. While Flandez called it a \\"scene-stealing turn\\" and commended it visually and vocally, he noted that Paltrow lacks Adele's veracity. Mercedes' \\"Ain't No Way\\" was named the best performance of the episode by both Futterman, who enjoyed her \\"powerhouse vocals\\", and the New York Post Jarett Wieselman, who called it \\"unbelievable\\", and praised the focus placed on Mercedes following a season which failed to showcase her. Flandez described the number as being \\"glamorously sung like [the] star she is\\", and hoped that she would be better used in future. In contrast, Reiter called it \\"a restrained rendition\\", but \\"prettily sung nonetheless\\", and Gonzalez struggled to connect with the \\"uncharacteristically average\\" song, though noted that for Mercedes that is \\"still 10 times better than a normal person\\" and awarded it a \\"B+\\".

Superior Court (Supreme Court of California, 1983, ) was a key case in California highlighting the conflict between the public trust doctrine and appropriative water rights. The Public Trust Doctrine is based on the principle that certain resources (such as navigable waters) are too valuable to be privately owned and must remain available for public use. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court, the court held that the public trust doctrine restricts the amount of water that can be withdrawn from navigable waterways. The basis for the Public Trust Doctrine goes back to Roman law. Under Roman law, the air, the rivers, the sea and the seashore were incapable of private ownership; they were dedicated to the use of the public. In essence, the public trust doctrine establishes the role of the state as having trustee environmental duties owed to the public that are subsequently enforceable by the public. There is judicial recognition of this, dictating that certain rights of the public are key to individual common law rights (such as state recognition of the public right or trust for waterways and coastal zones). Judicial recognition of the public trust doctrine has been established for tidelands and non-navigable waterways,Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Mississippi, 484 U.S. 469 (1988) submerged land (such as lake beds) and the waters above them,New York v. DeLyser, 759 F. Supp. 982 (W.D.N.Y. 1991)Ill. Cent. R. R., 146 U.S. 387 (1892) and preservation of a public interest (such as recreation, swimming, access, and sport fishing).Marks v. Whitney, 98 Cal. Rptr. 790, 491 P.2d 374 (1971) In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court, it was alleged by the plaintiffs that the public trust doctrine was being violated due to environmental damages to Mono Lake in the form of significant water level declines as a result of water diversions by the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP). DWP based their defense on the fact that they held permits, issued by the state for the diversions, and so the diversions were allowable. The central issue in the case was whether appropriative water rights (granted in the past) must consider the public trust doctrine, requiring protection of natural resources by the state. More specifically, the issue being addressed by the court was whether Mono Lake was subject to a public trust, which would invalidate Los Angeles' use of the streams feeding the lake. The California Supreme Court held that the state, under the public trust doctrine, had continuing responsibility for the state's navigable waters and that the public trust doctrine, therefore, prevented any party from appropriating water in a manner that harmed the public trust interests. However, the court also recognized that LA depended on these diversions as a critical water source, and this in turn mitigated the rule of law as the court held that water transfers were permissible even though some damage to the environment would occur as long as this was kept to minimal harm to the extent feasible. This ruling established that the public trust doctrine and appropriative water rights are \\"part of an integrated system of water law\\" and so both must be considered when determining appropriate use of water in California. Case Summary In 1979, the National Audubon Society, Mono Lake Committee, and others (Audubon) filed a suit against City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power DWP to suppress their diversion of the four tributaries that originally supplied Mono Lake with water from Sierra snowmelt. The public trust doctrine is the cornerstone and crux of this court case; the doctrine originates from Roman law and has persisted throughout European and English Common law. The Institutes of Justinian from the Sixth Century A.D. stated: by the law of nature these things are common to mankind -the air, running water, the sea and consequently the shores of the sea. Spanish and Mexican law also recognizes the public trust doctrine; the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo guarantees these rights in California. Thus, the public trust doctrine is a philosophical and realized extension of the concept of communal property, which belongs to the people and is to be held in a trust by the government. The public trust doctrine holds that our water, fish, and wildlife are shared resources to be held in an exalted position, above that of any industrial, commercial, or private uses in any administrative or judicial review of water allocation, and establishes that the government must uphold and protect this trusteeship as a moral obligation. Audubon's original complaint, filed with the Superior Court of Mono County, asserted the diversions were a violation of the public trust doctrine, were both a public and private nuisance, and a violation of California State Constitution Article X, Section 4 & Article XVI, Section 6, which respectively prohibit obstruction of navigable waters and gifts by the state of a state asset. The suit attempted to establish Public Trust rights in Mono Basin, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. This case eventually reached the Supreme Court of California, where a landmark ruling was handed down in favor of Audubon, which held that the public trust doctrine applied to the Los Angeles Mono Basin diversions and that the state must exercise continuous supervision to ensure that trust values are continuously considered.  Background  The leading case that established the public trust doctrine in the U.S. is the 1892 Supreme Court case Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois. The Court held that public trust submerged lands belong to the respective States within which they are found, with the consequent right to use or dispose of any portion thereof, when that can be done without substantial impairment of the interest of the public in the waters…. setting a precedent for strict scrutiny of any private taking of public trust land. The Court in Illinois voided the deed because under public trust law it did not promote a primary public purpose. This meaning has been supported by Federal and California Court decisions in Woodruff v. North Bloomfield, People v. Gold Run Ditch Mining Co., People ex rel Ricks Water Co. v. Elk River Mill and Lumber Co and People v. Truckee Lumber Co. These cases make it clear as a matter of law one must exercise rights or use property so as not to infringe on the rights, interests or properties of others. Procedural History 1928: California State Constitution Article X, Section 2 states that all waters of the state must be put to reasonable and beneficial use. Any waters in excess of the \\"reasonable and beneficial uses\\" are considered surplus waters available for use by others, as stipulated under the appropriative water rights administered by California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) Water rights are granted by the SWRBC after an application to appropriate water is approved and a permit is issued. The permit allows construction of a project needed to divert the water according to the terms and conditions of the permit, which includes submission of periodic progress reports by the applicant with SWRCB to ensure the application of the water is for beneficial use. If the conditional terms of the permit are met, SWRCB may issue a license to confirm the appropriative rights to the water. 1940: the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) was granted permits allowing appropriation for the entire flows of four out of five of Mono Lake's tributaries (Lee Vining, Walker, Parker, and Rush Creeks) for municipal use and hydropower generation. Mono Lake's tributaries contain glacial fed snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada and thus convey potable water, whereas the water in Mono Lake itself was and is not potable due to its salinity. Despite being granted permits, DWP lacked the appropriate conveyance facilities to physically appropriate and transport the volume of water that was granted at the time. 1963: The City of Los Angeles authorized the construction of a new aqueduct, the Second Los Angeles Aqueduct to transport surface water from Mono Basin and both surface and groundwater from Owens Basin. 1974: SWRCB issued licenses confirming DWP's right to divert water from Mono Lake tributaries, resulting in annual diversions of approximately of water from Mono Basin since the aqueduct was completed in 1970. The diversions from the second aqueduct caused the surface area of the lake to decrease by one-third and the lake level to drop , exposing of lakebed. 1977: Stanford biologist David Gaines published a study on Mono Lake's ecosystem highlighting the dangers of water diversion that garnered national attention to the potentially catastrophic ecological impacts to Mono Lake from the DWP diversions. This led to the formation of the Mono Lake Committee and a grassroots movement spanning over 30 years to stop the diversions and restore the basin California Water Wars. 1979: The California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) and the United States Department of the Interior (USDI) undertook a joint study of Mono Basin. The study concluded that the level of Mono Lake should be stabilized at . To achieve this goal, drastic reductions of water exports from Mono Basin were recommended from the present annual average of to a limit of . Legislation was introduced to implement this recommendation, but was never enacted. 1979: The National Audubon Society (Audubon), Mono Lake Committee, Friends of the Earth, the Los Angeles Audubon Society, and Mono Basin landowners initiated the original lawsuit with the Superior Court of Mono County in 1979 against Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP), asserting that the diversions were a violation of the public trust doctrine, were both a public and private nuisance, and a violation of California State Constitution Article X, Section 4 & Article XVI, Section 6, which respectively prohibit obstruction of navigable waters and gifts by the state of a state asset. The suit attempted to establish Public Trust rights in Mono Basin, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The Public Trust Case was originally argued as: National Audubon Society v. Los Angeles. Superior Court of Alpine County No. 6429. The case was transferred to Alpine Superior Court; DWP filed a cross-complaint seeking adjudication of Basin water rights to all appropriators, naming 117 cross-defendants, including the plaintiffs, the State, United States Forest Service, U.S Bureau of Land Management, and other private water users. DWP also sought a Congressional declaration stating they consented to the impairment of navigable waters of Mono Lake. Finally, DWP asserted that any nuisance at Mono Lake was attributable to the newly exposed lakebed and sought a declaration that conditions resulted from a valid exercise of the police power by the State of California. Simultaneously, Audubon sought permission to include a cause of action based on the federal common law of nuisance, asserting that Mono Lake is an \\"interstate or navigable\\" water in which there is an overriding federal interest, and DWP's diversions were causing water and air pollution. Due to the inclusion of federal agencies, the suit was transferred to Federal District Court, where they decided abstention was appropriate and remanded. Accordingly, Audubon was instructed to file an action in state court to resolve two key issues: 1.) The interrelationship between the California water rights system and the public trust doctrine: Is the public trust doctrine in this context subsumed in the California water rights system, or does it function independently of that system? Could the plaintiffs challenge the DWP's permits by asserting the public trust doctrine limits their permits and licenses, or argue that the water diversions are not \\"reasonable or beneficial,\\" as required under the California water rights system? And 2.) Whether exhaustion of administrative remedies was pursued or is applicable in this context. This case eventually reached the Supreme Court of California, carrying this title: National Audubon Society v. Superior Court. 33 Cal. 3d 419 (1983). Case At the beginning of the 20th century, the city of Los Angeles, which lies south of Mono Lake, began to undergo huge growth. As a result of this growth, the city needed additional sources of water. Around 1905, former Los Angeles Mayor, Fred Eaton, and his colleague William Mulholland, began to buy land in the Sierra Nevada region to secure water supply. The Owens River was utilized as a water source until 1919, and when the Owens River Valley began to dry up, Los Angeles investigated the Mono Basin area. In the 1930s, Los Angeles purchased of land in the Mono Basin. Over the next decade, Los Angeles took water from creeks and streams in the area.Kastner, D. 2003. Volcanoes of the Eastern Sierra Nevada: Geology and Natural Heritage of the Long Valley Caldera. Accessed online on April 21, 2011, at: http://www.indiana.edu/~sierra/papers/2003/Kastner.html In 1919, Mono Lake had a water surface elevation of above mean sea level. In 1955, the elevation of the lake was reduced to 6,405 and still dropping. The decrease in water volume of the lake subsequently increased lake salinity, adversely affecting the local food chain. In 1980, there was a documented fifty percent reduction in the resident shrimp population, and by the spring of 1981, this reduction reached ninety five percent. Also, as the water level of Mono Lake dropped, an island within the lake that was key nesting habitat for bird species became accessible from shore (effectively becoming a peninsula), allowing coyotes access to the nesting habitat. The subsequent predation on nesting birds significantly reduced population numbers. As the level of the lake continued to drop, shoreline area increased, resulting in airborne dust and sediment transport that covered the lake with very fine silt and impacted water quality. In 1976, a group of students from the University of California began to study the Mono Lake environment. Their research concluded that the lake's reduction in water level caused environmental damage, including the loss of the lake's brine shrimp, loss of migrating and nesting birds, and the destruction of the Mono Lake's natural beauty. In 1979, the National Audubon Society, Mono Lake Committee, Friends of the Earth, and four Mono Lake landowners filed suit against the DWP. Plaintiffs claimed that the waters of Mono Lake were protected from the DWP diversions by the public trust doctrine. The Supreme Court held that the state has an obligation to protect Mono Lake once the diversions begin to harm public trust interests.13 Environs Envtl. L. & Pol'y J. 16 1989-1990 The court also held that California water law permitted the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to objectively study Mono Lake water rights after the agency granted the rights. Audubon claimed that air pollution in the form of alkali dust storms were caused by Mono Lake's dropping water level. On October 6, 1988, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, held that Audubon could not claim a federal common law nuisance based on air pollution. In 1984, when DWP threatened to once again dry the creek, a trout fisherman, Dick Dahlgren, joined by California Trout, filed suit against the DWP. Plaintiffs argued that not only did DWP violate the Public Trust Doctrine, it also violated the California Department of Fish and Game Code § 5937. From this case, the court required the DWP to release into lower Rush Creek. In 1986, the Mono Lake Committee brought a similar lawsuit to protect Lee Vining Creek. The court ordered the DWP to maintain a flow of to the creek. In 1989, the court halted the case for four years to allow the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to produce an Environmental Impact Report in order to recondition DWP's water right licenses, and to prove compliance with the Public Trust Doctrine and the Fish and Game codes During 1993–94, SWRCB Vice-Chairman Marc Del Piero, the attorney on the Board, served as the SWRCB's sole hearing officer and conducted the water rights hearings that lasted for over forty-three days . On September 28, 1994, the SWRCB unanimously adopted Order 1631 and ordered that the lake must be restored to a height of 6392 feet above sea level within the next 20 years. The DWP can continue to divert water during these 20 years, but only an average of per year and the DWP must restore waterfowl and stream damage that resulted from past diversions. Issues In this case, the California courts resolved two issues: The first issue was, whether the Public Trust Doctrine functions independently of the California Water Rights System. The public trust doctrine defines its purpose as maintaining, \\"All of its navigable, commerce, fishing, swimming, and other recreational purposes as trustee of a public trust for the benefit of the people.\\" Therefore, the waterways cannot belong to just one person as private property; they must be available to all people.Meidinger, E. 2001. Prior App/Pub Trust. Accessed online on April 21, 2011, at http://www.law.buffalo.edu/homepage/eemeid/monolake.html The Public Trust Doctrine has also been expanded to protect lands in their natural state to serve as ecological units for scientific study. Mono Lake is a navigable waterway, and it harvests brine shrimp for sale as fish food. Under the traditional public trust cases, the lake is identified as a fishery. Plaintiffs sought to protect the lake's exceptional recreational and ecological value of the lake and its shore, the purity of the air, and the use of the lake for nesting and feeding by birds. Quoting Marks v. Whitney, the court said, \\"There is a growing public recognition that one of the most important public uses of the tidelands and use encompassed within the tidelands trust is the preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area.\\" As a result, Mono Lake is a navigable water, and the beds, shores, and waters of the lake are protected by the public trust.7 UCLA J. Envtl. L. & Pol'y 79 1987-1988 During the trial the court brought up two cases that dealt with non-navigable waterways. In 1884, the court considered impairment of navigability in the American and Sacramento rivers due to mining on their non-navigable tributaries. Gold Run Ditching and Mining Company used water cannons to wash gold bearing gravel from the hillsides. As a result, 600,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel went into the American River and washed downstream into the beds of both the American and Sacramento rivers. The court said \\"The State holds the absolute right to all navigable waters and the soils under them. The soil she holds as trustee of a public trust for the benefit of the people; and she may, by her legislature, grant it to an individual; but she cannot grant the rights of the people to the use of the navigable waters flowing over it…\\" In the second case, in 1901, the defendant in People v. Russ had built dams on sloughs, which flowed from the Salt River. The dams had been built to prevent water from flowing on to the defendant's land, but the state said they were a public nuisance. In the National Audubon case, DWP argued that when the Water Board approved a permit, the water right became a vested right. The California Supreme Court held that the public trust is \\"an affirmation of the duty of the state to protect the people's common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands, surrendering that right only in rare cases when the abandonment of that right is consistent with the purposes of the trust.\\" 7 UCLA J. Envtl. L. & Pol'y 67 1987-1988 The second issue in this case was whether plaintiffs must exhaust their remedies before the Water Board prior to bringing action in court. The California Supreme Court determined that remedy can be pursued from the Water Board by challenging the unreasonable or unbeneficial use of appropriated water or by bringing an independent public trust claim. Therefore, the plaintiffs could claim that DWP's use of the water was unreasonable. Plaintiffs also could bring the public trust claim pursuant to section 2501 of the Water Code, which said, \\"The board may determine, in the proceedings provided for in this chapter, all rights to water of a stream system whether based upon appropriation, riparian right, or other basis of right.\\" Section 2501 refers to water rights as bringing the proceedings before the Water Board.  Decision  The California Supreme Court entered its decision in 1983 with the majority opinion written by Justice Broussard with Justices Bird, Mosk, Kaus and Reynoso, concurring. A separate concurring opinion was entered by Kaus. Justice Richardson issued an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. While the public trust doctrine protects navigable waterways like Mono Lake, the question remained whether diversions of non-navigable waters like the Mono Lake tributaries might also fall under the doctrine's scope. The majority concluded that when diversions of non- navigable tributaries impair the public interest in navigable waterways, the scope of the public trust doctrine is sufficiently broad to proscribe such actions. The applicability of the public trust doctrine to the case was described by the court as follows: \\"The principal values plaintiffs seek to protect . . . are recreational and ecological . . . the scenic views of the lake and its shore, the purity of the air and the use of the lake for nesting and feeding by birds. Under Marks v. Whitney, supra, 6 Cal.3d 251, 98 Cal. Rptr. 790, 491 P.2d 374, it is clear that protection of these values is among the purposes of the public trust.\\" In examining the relationship between the public trust doctrine and appropriative water rights in California, the court determined that, in some cases, the public interest served by water diversions may outweigh considerations of harm to public trust sources. The population and economy of California depend on the appropriation of vast quantities of water for uses unrelated to trust values. However, the court held that harm to public trust resources should be avoided or minimized if feasible. The court stated that, under Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution \\"all uses of water, including public trust uses, must conform to the standard of reasonable use.\\" In concluding, the court stated that the water rights held by Los Angeles were granted in absence of consideration of the effects of the diversions on the public trust resources of the Mono Basin and that the allocation of water from the basin streams should be reconsidered. The state has a \\"duty\\" to protect the public's \\"common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands, and tidelands.\\" The court also ruled that the State Water Resource Control Board (SWRCB) and the courts have concurrent jurisdiction to consider the effect of water diversions on public trust resources. The court ordered a study to be prepared to determine the impact of DWP's diversion upon the public trust of Mono Lake. In subsequent proceedings following this decision, DWP has been ordered to reduce diversions by approximately two thirds until the water levels in Mono Lake recover to an acceptable level (expected to take decades). Dissent Richardson concurred with parts one through four of the majority opinion (background and history of the Mono Lake litigation; the public trust doctrine in California; The California water rights system; and, the relationship between the public trust doctrine and the California water rights system) and with the analysis of the relationship between the public trust doctrine and the water rights system in this state. However, Richardson entered a dissent from part five of the opinion (exhaustion of administrative remedies) where the majority held that the courts and the California Water Resources Board have concurrent jurisdiction in cases of this kind. Richardson's dissent of part five concluded, \\"The majority's suggestion that various statutory provisions contemplate the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction in cases of this kind is unconvincing.\\" In support of this, Richardson cited the Water Code (§§ 2000, 2001, 2075) as well as Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist (1980) and (1977). Legal and Policy Implications The decision of the court expanded the reach of the public trust doctrine to non-navigable tributaries of navigable waters. This allows for legal challenges to be made to administrative decisions made by the state in regards water appropriations where natural resource values are affected. This potential for legal challenge on the basis of natural resource values forces administrative decisions to include specific consideration of long-term resource impairment in tandem with economic development. Therefore, although the public trust doctrine doesn't preclude the conveyance of water rights to a private party where a natural resource held in the public trust may be affected, following National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983), it does impose a condition on the future use of waters appropriated to further the public interest (the finding that harm must be minimized to the extent feasible). There are, however, broad discretionary powers for states and legislatures to define exactly what the public purpose is. As technology has advanced, waters of the U.S. have been used less for commerce and navigation, the basis for most current environmental law, and more for recreational purposes. In recognition of this, the public trust doctrine can also be employed, using the discretionary powers enjoyed by states for determining public purpose, as the basis for the preservation of a public interest in recreation. Other states, such as Montana, have integrated natural resource values and the public trust doctrine into appropriative water rights through allowing water to be appropriated for future uses that are protective of the environment or a resource (such as maintaining instream flows for water quality or habitat connectivity). In this way, states may establish an appropriative right for water that is integrated with the system of water law as the water is not \\"used\\" in the traditional sense of being diverted for commercial, agricultural, or industrial use, but is appropriated to remain in the stream channel. The overriding legal implication of the courts decision in National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) is that traditional use of the public trust doctrine to ensure that valuable public resources are not lost to the public through diversion to public control has been altered to encompass an all-embracing environmental protection mechanism. In cases in which the traditional doctrine evolved to protect common rights of access for commercial purposes, the modern public trust doctrine proclaims conservationist principles.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 26, 2011. The episode was written by Brad Falchuk and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and is a tribute to Lady Gaga, the second such tribute to the artist in the show's history; the first one was \\"Theatricality\\". Most of the major plots of the episode center on the topic of homosexuality, as Kurt (Chris Colfer) lays the groundwork for his longtime bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) to come to terms with his sexuality, and Santana (Naya Rivera) plots to run for school prom queen in the hopes of winning her love interest Brittany (Heather Morris) from Artie (Kevin McHale). \\"Born This Way\\" attracted mostly positive reception from most critics of the show, as many felt that it was one of the better episodes of the season. However, the episode came under scrutiny by several conservative media critics who criticized the show's depiction of homosexuality. This episode featured cover versions of seven songs, including a cover of \\"Born This Way\\" by Lady Gaga. Other musical works featured in the episode include cover versions of the Keane song \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and \\"I've Gotta Be Me\\" from the 1968 Broadway production Golden Rainbow. The musical covers and performances were met with generally positive reception from critics, with several noting that it contained the best musical selection in a while. With the exception of \\"Barbra Streisand\\", all cover versions were released as singles available for digital download. Upon its initial airing, the episode was viewed by 8.62 million American viewers, and garnered a 3.4/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, the lowest ratings and total viewership of the season. The episode's ratings and total viewership significantly declined from the previous episode, \\"Night of Neglect\\", which had previously been the low point in viewership. Plot During dance rehearsals for the upcoming Nationals competition, New Directions glee club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) accidentally breaks Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) nose. Her doctor (George Wyner) recommends septoplasty and elective rhinoplasty; Rachel considers modelling her nose after Finn's current girlfriend Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), and the two girls duet on the mash-up \\"I Feel Pretty/Unpretty\\". Both Finn and Puck (Mark Salling) oppose her planned transformation. Puck tries to help her accept her nose as part of her Jewish heritage, and recruits Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), who convinces her to look to her idol Barbra Streisand, who refused to succumb to pressure to alter her nose. Ultimately, Rachel decides against having surgery. Club member Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) uses Rachel's broken nose as a launching point to highlight the other group members' physical flaws. Aiming to help them achieve self-acceptance, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) urges them to embrace their perceived flaws by printing them on T-shirts to be worn during a group performance of Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way\\". He also encourages school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) to confront her OCD; she begins treatment with a psychiatrist, Dr. Shane (Kathleen Quinlan). In this episode, Kurt (Chris Colfer, pictured) returns to McKinley High School. Santana, who is a closeted lesbian, decides to run for school prom queen in the hope that she can win the love of her best friend Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), who is dating Artie (Kevin McHale). She realizes that popular jock Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is also in the closet, after noticing him checking out Sam (Chord Overstreet), and hatches an elaborate scheme to attain her goals: she threatens to out Karofsky unless he agrees to stop the bullying that drove Kurt from McKinley and the glee club. The pair form an anti-bullying club to make the school safer in order to entice Kurt back and bolster the glee club's chance at Nationals, though mostly to boost Santana's popularity before the prom. They also become one another's \\"beard\\" to bolster their heterosexual facades. Karofsky issues an apology to Kurt at a group meeting involving Will, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), and their fathers. Though Kurt wants to transfer back to McKinley from Dalton Academy, he is hesitant until Karofsky admits privately that Santana's prom queen scheme is behind his change of heart and the anti-bullying movement; Kurt agrees to return, but only if Karofsky will start a school PFLAG club with him. As Kurt arrives back at McKinley, the Dalton Academy Warblers glee club that he had joined while he was away—fronted by his boyfriend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss)—serenades him in farewell with a rendition of Keane's \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\". Kurt marks his re-entry to New Directions with a solo performance of \\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\\" from Sunset Boulevard. As the race for prom queen intensifies, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) begins campaigning against Quinn. She discovers that Quinn's first name is Lucy, and that she used to be an overweight outcast who had rhinoplasty before re-inventing herself and transferring to McKinley. Lauren attempts to sabotage Quinn's campaign by revealing her former image to the other students, but it backfires when Quinn's popularity actually increases amongst the girls like Lauren, encouraged by the idea of someone able to rise above such difficulties like she did, and become popular. Lauren apologizes to Quinn, but Quinn commends her for her confidence and pride, and the two form a bond. Brittany shows off her shirt to Santana, and gives Santana a shirt reading \\"Lebanese\\", believing that it reads \\"Lesbian\\". Santana balks at wearing it, and the two argue; Brittany finally storms off saying that if Santana loved herself as much as Brittany loved her, she would put on the shirt and dance with her. The episode closes with the club, minus Santana, embracing their identities and performing \\"Born This Way\\". During the song, Emma arrives wearing a T-shirt that acknowledges her own problems—it reads \\"OCD\\"—and she and Will join the performance. Karofsky and Santana watch from the audience, with Santana wearing her \\"Lebanese\\" shirt. Production The episode was extended and ran for 90 minutes, as opposed to the usual 60 minutes. Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24 minutes of screen time, and commented: \\"We're always desperately cutting down our episodes. Even when we write them, and then in the editing room we're always throwing away stuff that I really love to get it down to time. [...] It will be just really interesting content-wise for us [to have an extension].\\" The focus of the episode is Lady Gaga's song \\"Born This Way\\", which she approved for use in Glee before the song premiered. This will be the second episode to highlight Gaga's music, the first one being season one's \\"Theatricality\\". According to Monteith, the focus of \\"Born This Way\\" is the characters \\"embracing the things about [them]selves that [they] don't like and tailoring [their] performances around that.\\" It features homophobic Dave Karofsky starting to come to terms with his homosexuality. The plot arc, which began in the season's sixth episode, \\"Never Been Kissed\\", is intended by series creator Ryan Murphy to have a happy ending. He explained that, while someone like Karofsky could turn to drugs or alcohol or commit suicide, Glee is \\"by nature optimistic\\", so he plans to conclude the storyline positively. For fellow closeted character Santana, \\"Born This Way\\" set up the final three episodes of the season, which will increase focus on her love for her best friend Brittany. The episode additionally marked the first appearance of guest star Dr. Shane, \\"a very smart, cool and kind psychiatrist\\" who may become a recurring character. Other characters seen in \\"Born This Way\\" include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans and Lauren Zizes, Kurt's boyfriend Blaine Anderson, school bully Azimio (James Earl), Principal Figgins, and Karofsky's father, Paul (Daniel Roebuck). In addition to \\"Born This Way\\", the other songs covered in the episode were Keane's \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\", \\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\\" from the musical Sunset Boulevard, a mash-up of \\"I Feel Pretty\\" from West Side Story and \\"Unpretty\\" by TLC, \\"I've Gotta Be Me\\" from the musical Golden Rainbow, and Duck Sauce's \\"Barbra Streisand\\". All but \\"Barbra Streisand\\" were released as digital singles for the episode. \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" was included on the series' seventh soundtrack, Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers, and \\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\\", \\"Born This Way\\" and \\"I Feel Pretty / Unpretty\\" were included on the series' eighth soundtrack, Glee: The Music, Volume 6. Reception =Ratings= \\"Born This Way\\" was first broadcast on April 26, 2011, in the United States. It averaged a 3.4/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, and also averaged nearly 8.62 million American viewers during its initial airing. The first hour of the show garnered 8.3 million American viewers and a 3.3/9 rating in the 18–49 demographic, despite airing simultaneously with a rerun of NCIS on CBS, The Biggest Loser on NBC, No Ordinary Family on ABC, and One Tree Hill on The CW. The last half-hour of the episode had 8.5 million American viewers, as well as a 3.4/9 rating in the 18–49 demographic, despite airing alongside a rerun of NCIS: Los Angeles on CBS, Dancing with the Stars on ABC, The Voice on NBC, and Hellcats on The CW. The total viewership and ratings were the lowest of the second season of Glee, and was down from those of the previous episode, \\"Night of Neglect\\", which was watched by 9.80 million American viewers and acquired a 3.8/11 rating/share upon first airing. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.52 million viewers (2.087 million on E4, and 433,000 on E4+1), becoming the most-watched show on E4 and E4 +1 for the week, and the most-watched show on cable for the week. =Critical response= \\"Born This Way\\" was given a positive reception by many critics of the show. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone and Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly both considered it to be an improvement from the previous episode. Futterman wrote that it \\"gave us the charm, wit and just-zany-enough- to-be-plausible plot lines we were sorely missing after last week's predictable\\" episode, and added, \\"Even better: the episode didn't feel as long as the 90 minutes it clocked in at.\\" IGN Robert Canning gave the episode a \\"great\\" rating of 8 out of 10. While he said the episode was entertaining, he felt that it did not need to be an hour and a half. Emily Yahr of The Washington Post agreed about the extended length, and did not like what she called \\"lame attempts to fill time\\", which she said \\"detracted from what started as a decent episode\\". She did, however, cite several \\"promising storylines\\", including Rachel's, and noted, \\"Usually, New Directions leader Rachel Berry is a caricature of all things annoying—but this episode, we see her genuinely struggling with wanting to love herself the way she is\\". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson summed it up as follows: \\"Not an epic episode, just sort of … meh.\\" Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times reacted more positively and wrote, \\"The 90-minute episode had a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, some good lessons, character development, a few good numbers and more than a few surprises.\\" The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff gave it a \\"B\\", and wrote that she \\"finally got a sense that, yes, this second season has been building toward something and has been trying to tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', for the first time in a long time, made me feel like I could say I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers.\\" Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by \\"focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids\\". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that \\"Born This Way\\" was \\"the show's best episode to date\\", and \\"an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe.\\" Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode \\"was a noble effort\\" but \\"it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to.\\" Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode \\"sounded just the perfect notes\\" and called it \\"the best episode yet\\". He continued: \\"The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft.\\" The character development of Santana (Naya Rivera, pictured) received much acclaim. Several critics praised the development of Santana. Hankinson wrote, \\"My goodness, Santana. It's as if all the writers sat around a room, identified the best lines of tonight's episode and then decided to give them all to Santana. Fantastic.\\" VanDerWerff called Santana the highlight of the episode: \\"The best thing about this episode is Naya Rivera's work as Santana and the story the three writers have cooked up for her. Rivera's really come into her own this season, going from just a generic bitchy cheerleader to an actual character who has motivations and might be a better villain for the show than Sue.\\" He added, \\"the storyline of Santana realizing she was in love with Brittany and, thus, is probably a lesbian has been nicely plotted and surprisingly deep. The reveal about Santana hasn't washed away her less savory qualities; indeed, it's heightened them, to a degree, as she struggles to be true to herself and still maintain her status as the hottest girl in school.\\" Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote of Santana, \\"This episode just cemented my love for her. The insult spew in the beginning of the episode was awesomely mean.\\" She also said that Santana's \\"inner monologue is often more entertaining than other characters' outer monologues\\". CNN Lisa Respers France considered Santana the episode's highlight, and went on to write, \\"She embraced her inner lesbian (sort of) and rattled off the best [lines] like 'the only straight I am is straight-up [bitch].' You gotta love that.\\" Some critics reacted negatively to the episode. Scott Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune felt that the show has jumped the shark starting from this episode. He felt that the Kurt storyline had some major flaws, and that the messages being sent have been mixed. The episode garnered criticism from a number of conservatives, who found the depiction of homosexuality abrasive. In an interview with ABC News, conservative media critic Dan Gainor felt that it was Ryan Murphy's \\"latest depraved initiative to promote his gay agenda.\\" He added: \\"This is clearly Ryan Murphy's vision of what growing up should be, not most of America's. It's a high school most parents would not want to send their kids to.\\" =Music and performances= The musical performances and cover versions in the episode received generally positive commentary. Gonzalez stated that she loved the song choices, and Meghan Brown of The Atlantic felt that this episode carried the best selection of music of a Glee episode in a long time. Flandez commended that they are \\"tailored songs that carried emotional heft\\". Critics mostly reacted with acclaim for the mash-up of \\"I Feel Pretty / Unpretty\\". Gonzalez gave the performance an \\"A\\" and commented: \\"While part of me would have said that pairing Rachel and Quinn for a duet would vocally be like putting a pit bull in a cage match with a Maltipoo, it actually worked! There was a surprisingly balanced and incredibly lovely tone.\\" All three writers of The Atlantic review praised the mash-up: Patrick Burns said it was beautiful, and noted that \\"the arrangement was clever, the ladies sounded great, and the song was placed perfectly into the plot of two characters who were restored a bit of their depth in this episode\\", Brown stated that the song was lovely, and Kevin Fallon felt that it was \\"unexpectedly gorgeous and haunting\\", and noted that it was \\"yet another example of how skilled the music directors are at these mash-ups.\\" Semigran felt that it was the best performance of the night, and TV Line Michael Slezak gave the piece an \\"A\\", and said that it was a \\"vocally and visually stunning set piece for the unlikeliest of duet partners.\\" Flandez commented that the song \\"floated like gossamer between Rachel and Quinn as they beautifully poured the sentiments of ugly ducklings\\", and Futterman wrote, \\"It's a poignant moment, and the inclusion of West Side Story 'I Feel Pretty' makes for a great pop/theater mash-up that reminds us of what Glee is at its heart.\\" Kurt's performance of \\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\\" was also met with critical acclaim. Brown stated that the song was \\"absolutely stunning in every conceivable way.\\" She thought that he had the emotional connection, the musicality, and the storytelling ability \\"down pat\\". Gonzalez gave the song an \\"A−\\" and wrote, \\"Kurt apparently picked up a few helpful notes ... from his Warbler brothers and emerged an even better solo singer than I recall. ... Most enjoyable, however, was a tenderness Kurt added to the song that I don't think could have been duplicated by any other member of this ensemble.\\" Slezak commended Kurt's voice, gave the song an \\"A\\", and said, \\"I feel like we haven't had too many strong musical moments from Kurt this season, but this number, which pushed Chris Colfer's falsetto to impressive heights, went a long way to erase the deficit.\\" Futterman thought that it was \\"a sweeter moment than last season's 'Rose's Turn', but the high notes and big vocals are still there.\\" Berk gave it three out of five stars and called it \\"lovely, and properly sentimental\\". Zoller Seitz called the performance \\"spellbinding\\" and concluded, \\"Chris Colfer turns 'As if We Never Said Goodbye' into a valentine to self-knowledge and self-improvement—and a young, gay singer's dream of treating the world as a stage and commanding it like a star.\\" alt=A woman in front of a podium, wearing a one shouldered black top and a black-and-white flowing skirt. She wears a blue bob wig and smiles towards the camera The New Directions' rendition of \\"Born This Way\\" was strongly approved by Lady Gaga. On her Twitter account, she wrote, \\"I really loved Glee Born This Way episode. I admire the show for being brave+fighting for such modern social messaging. Never back down.\\" Gonzalez gave the performance a \\"B+\\", and commented that it wasn't her favorite group number, mostly because she felt the song \\"wasn't [Lady Gaga's] best effort\\". Berk was less kind about the song, and called it a \\"crappy but thematically admirable Gaga tune\\", though he gave it three stars out of five. Slezak gave it an \\"A−\\" and approved of the rendition: \\"it was nice to see and hear Tina, Mercedes and Kurt on lead vocals—instead of, say, Blaine, Rachel, and Mr. Schue.\\" The duet of \\"I Gotta Be Me\\" by Finn and Mike was considered to be \\"shockingly adorable\\" by Berk, who gave it four stars out of five. Slezak was less impressed: \\"The jazz band arrangement and the Mike- teaches-Finn-some-moves choreography was cute, I guess, but it's not a good sign that I spent half the number focusing on Mike's matching green t-shirt and shoe laces.\\" He went on to question the song's inclusion—\\"In an episode about confronting one's greatest teenage insecurities, I wonder if there might have been a better choice for a solo than the popular football player with the cheerleader girlfriend lamenting his inability to dance\\"—and ultimately gave the performance a \\"B−\\". Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: \\"In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked.\\" \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\", as performed by Blaine and the Warblers, received an \\"A+\\" from Gonzalez, who loved the song and commented that she was \\"going to miss the Warblers\\". Slezak gave the performance a \\"B\\", and said that he \\"can't be too mad at another pretty song sung well by Darren Criss.\\" The performance was acclaimed by Futterman, who wrote, \\"While the rest of the Warblers maintain their stoic facade, Blaine shows enough emotion to make this bittersweet Keane tune a simple, yet powerful, performance.\\" The flash-mob mall performance of \\"Barbra Streisand\\" was deemed to be pointless by Gonzalez, and she gave it a \\"C\\", her lowest grade of the episode. Futterman enjoyed the performance, thinking that it was \\"the episode's most fun moment and beats out last year's 'Safety Dance' for Glee numbers done in a mall.\\" Slezak also reacted positively to the performance, giving it a \\"B+\\". =Chart history= Several of the cover versions featured debuted on numerous musical charts.

In June 2017, SSL announced its first commercial customer, Luxembourg-based satellite owner/operator SES S.A. History MDA Corporation announced in early 2010 that a small-scale geosynchronous-orbit refueling project was under development. The design point was to be a single spacecraft that would refuel other spacecraft in orbit as a satellite- servicing demonstration. The 2010 announcement indicated that MDA had already signed an option agreement \\"with an unidentified satellite fleet operator that has agreed to provide an aging telecommunications spacecraft for a refueling operation as the inaugural customer.\\" Missions contemplated included not only satellite refueling but also space debris mitigation by including the vehicle capability to \\"push dead satellites into graveyard orbits.\\" The early technical design point included a fuel-depot vehicle that would maneuver to an operational communications satellite, dock at the target satellite's apogee- kick motor, remove a small part of the target spacecraft's thermal protection blanket, connect to a fuel-pressure line and deliver the propellant. In 2010, it was estimated that \\"the docking maneuver would take the communications satellite out of service for about 20 minutes.\\" A potential business model for the service, , would \\"ask customers to pay per kilogram of fuel successfully added to their satellite, with the per-kilogram price being a function of the additional revenue the operator can expect to generate from the spacecraft’s extended operational life.\\" In March 2011, MDA announced that Intelsat was to be their inaugural launch partner and that the SIS vehicle could be ready to launch as early as 2015, with Intelsat providing up to over the timeframe that the on-orbit services would be delivered to a portion of the Intelsat satellite fleet. , MDA suspended the satellite servicing mission while awaiting major decisions due soon on the scope and details on planned satellite servicing missions by US government civilian and defence agencies NASA and DARPA. MDA wants to \\"see the NASA and DARPA bid requests, see what’s in them, whether [MDA] can bid as a Canadian company, or as a U.S. company.\\" MDA Chief Executive Officer Daniel E. Friedmann said \\"We can’t just go ahead. I know everybody says the government is not a competitor, and yes, literally they are not a competitor. But our whole business is about winning business from the government and then taking that dual-use technology into the commercial market.\\" In February 2012, MDA said it was awaiting \\"a decision on a contract bid to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) before deciding whether to shelve its work on a vehicle to service satellites and perform other chores in orbit.\\"Fate of Canadian Satellite Servicing Project Awaits DARPA Decision, Space News, 1 Mar 2012. In a June 2012 article in The Space Review, a number of approaches to satellite servicing were discussed and contrasted. The MDA Space Infrastructure Servicing concept is reported to be somewhat more complex than the competitive ViviSat Mission Extension Vehicle, and is considered to be similar to the concepts that NASA is investigating experimentally with a test platform called the Robotic Refueling Mission flying on the International Space Station during the Expedition 29–32 timeframe in 2011-2013. MDA's approach \\"would use its manipulators to refuel or repair the spacecraft. The original announcement of the SIS by MDA in March of 2011 envisioned using it to deploy stuck [solar] arrays—like the case of [Intelsat] IS-19—or grapple debris. 'Direct refueling, robotically, of a satellite is not trivial, but it’s fully doable.'\\" By comparison, the DARPA Project Phoenix program has an even more complex mission concept: \\"cooperatively harvest and re-use valuable components from satellites in orbit that have been retired. DARPA envisions a servicing spacecraft that could remove a solar array, antenna, or other component from a defunct satellite and transport it to another satellite, either a newly constructed spacecraft or one in need or repairs. 'Phoenix is truly all about going up to retired, non-cooperative, non-controlled satellites that have been left for dead in the geosynchronous graveyard orbit, essentially, and see if we can resurrect capability out of those satellites or those satellite components.'\\" In March 2016, 'Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites' (RSGS) became DARPA's new name for the Phoenix Project. In February 2017, DARPA selected MDA's Palo Alto, California company, SSL, as their commercial partner for the RSGS Program.http://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2017-02-09 In June 2017, SSL announced the formation of Space Infrastructure Services LLC (SIS), its contract to SSL to build SIS's first Robotic Servicing Vehicle, and its first commercial customer, Luxembourg-based satellite owner/operator SES S.A. https://www.sslmda.com/html/pressreleases/pr20170628.html In-space refueling demonstration projects =MDA= , MDA had secured its first major customer for the initial demonstration project. Intelsat entered into a preliminary agreement to purchase one-half of the propellant payload that the MDA spacecraft would carry into geostationary orbit. Such a purchase was projected to add somewhere between two and four years of additional service life for up to five Intelsat satellites, assuming 200 kg of fuel is delivered to each commsat. SIS was envisioned to carry a toolkit designed to open most of the approximately 40 types of \\"fueling systems aboard satellites now in geostationary orbit.\\" Technical details The servicing plan for the initial satellite on the demonstration mission was: *\\"Intelsat [would] select one of its satellites nearing retirement to be moved into a standard graveyard orbit some 200 to 300 kilometers above the geostationary arc 36,000 kilometers over the equator.\\" *MDA [was to] \\"launch the SIS servicer, which [would] rendezvous and dock with the Intelsat satellite, [and attach itself] to the ring around the satellite’s apogee-boost motor.\\" *Controlled from a ground station, \\"the SIS robotic arm [was to] reach through the nozzle of the apogee motor to find and unscrew the satellite’s fuel cap.\\" *\\"the SIS vehicle [would then] reclose the fuel cap after delivering the agreed amount of propellant and then head to its next mission.\\" Post-demonstration mission extension In addition to refueling and servicing geostationary comm sats with the fuel that is initially launched with the vehicle, the SIS vehicle is being designed to have the ability to orbitally maneuver to rendezvous with a replacement fuel canister after deploying the of fuel in the first load, enabling the further refueling of additional satellites after the initial multi-satellite servicing mission is complete. =Technology maturation by NASA= MDA's commercial interest in robotic in-space refueling got a boost in 2013 when NASA completed a demonstration mission doing robotic refueling of satellite hardware that had never been designed for refuel. In January 2013, an extensive series of robotically-actuated propellant transfer experiments on the exposed facility platform of the International Space Station (ISS) were completed by the NASA Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM). The NASA Robotic Refueling Mission was launched in 2011. The set of experiments included a number of propellant valves, nozzles and seals similar to those used on a wide variety commercial and government satellites, plus a series of four prototype tools that could be attached to the distal end of a Space Station robotic arm. Each tool was a prototype of a device that \\"could be used by future satellite servicing missions to refuel spacecraft in orbit. RRM is the first in-space refueling demonstration using a platform and fuel valve representative of most existing satellites, which were never designed for refueling.\\" Competitive approaches Competitive design alternatives to in-space RCS fuel transfer exist. The ViviSat Mission Extension Vehicle illustrates one alternative approach that would connect to the target satellite in a similar way as MDA SIS, via the kick motor, but will not transfer fuel. Rather, ViviSat will use \\"its own thrusters to supply attitude control for the target.\\" ViviSat believes their approach is simpler and can operate at lower cost than MDA, while having the technical ability to dock with a greater number (90 percent) of the approximately 450 geostationary satellites in orbit. In September, 2012, the DLR Space Administration announced a funded development project to build a two-vehicle set of spacecraft to demonstrate several technologies necessary for on-orbit satellite servicing, including spacecraft refuelling, to enable satellite mission extension and also controlled disposal of a defective satellite. The project is entitled \\"DEOS\\" (German orbital servicing mission), and consists of \\"two satellites, a 'client' and a 'servicer'. The client acts as the satellite requiring maintenance or disposal. The servicer carries out the necessary work on the client.\\" The two spacecraft will be launched together into low-Earth orbit of . , the mission \\"will be ready for launch in 2018.\\" EADS Astrium Friedrichshafen is the prime contractor for the definition phase of the DEOS project, with a contract value of approximately €13 million.

A young man reads a short story about a boy and girl; saying that they didn't know it, but their lives would one day irrevocably change. Bill (Michael Sheen) and Kate (Maria Bello) are a married couple who are tightly wound and devoted to their work. Bill is a businessman, and Kate proofreads books for a living. The only thing keeping them together is their eighteen-year-old son Sam (Kyle Gallner), who is having trouble adjusting to college. One morning, it is reported on the news that there has been a shooting spree at Sam's school. They are then visited by the police who inform them that Sam is not only dead, but that he was the gunman. Kate refuses to believe that their son would do something so horrible, and spends the night tidying up Sam's room as if nothing has happened. As the news media descends upon the couple, Bill and Kate decide to stay with Kate's brother Eric (Alan Tudyk) and his wife Trish (Moon Bloodgood). The next morning, Eric and Trish's son Dylan (Cody Wai-Ho Lee) turns on the television to see a video made by Sam about the impending massacre. Bill then decides to issue a public statement, saying that they are both deeply sorry over what has happened, and ask for their privacy as they endeavor to get their lives back on track. They have a small funeral with only family present. Trish soon becomes agitated at Kate's nit-picking, and her attempts to mother Dylan, but Eric says that she has to be sensitive to their situation since Sam was her only child. They eventually leave, saying they are going to visit a friend, but check into a motel instead. The manager (Meat Loaf) not knowing who they are, makes a comment about Sam and his \\"monster family\\". Bill goes back to the house where he finds a teenage boy in Sam's room going through his belongings. They have a short scuffle where Bill cuts his hand, and the boy calls him a \\"psycho\\". He returns to the motel with their laptop, and finds a video from Sam. He and Kate view it together; Sam only says \\"mom and dad , I'm sorry, please don't hate me\\". Bill and Kate get into an argument about what could have caused Sam to kill all those innocent people. Bill lashes out at Kate for always critiquing every decision that Sam made, but she says that he was never there for them because he was always so busy working. Bill ends up saying that he wishes that Sam was never born, and Kate leaves. She goes back to their house for the first time since the shooting, and looks through Sam's room. Bill meets with his boss Harry (Bruce French), who reluctantly agrees that he can return to work next week. While grocery shopping, Kate runs into her young co-worker Cooper (Austin Nichols). They go back to the house, after sharing a sad memory he excuses himself for the bathroom. Kate then discovers Cooper is actually researching Sammy when she finds his notebook. She catches him in Sam's room looking through Sam's stories. He says that he is writing a piece about the shooting, but that he wanted to portray Sam in a more human light by learning more about him. Saddened, Kate asks him to leave. Bill finally returns to work, but feels alienated by the rest of the staff who keep staring at him. After Bill furiously demands what their problem is, Harry tells Bill to take more time off to see a therapist, so he quits. Bill later visits the cemetery to find Sam's gravestone vandalized, with the word killer written on it. He breaks down both physically and emotionally as he tries to scrub the word off with his bandaged hand. Kate reads all of Sam's stories, and goes to Sam's gravestone as well. She gets a call from the motel manager about Bill, and finds him curled up and depressed in their old room. Kate embraces the emotionally distraught Bill, and takes him home. Sam's voice is heard again as he ends his short story about the boy and girl. He says that no matter what they do, their lives will never be the same.

The film has won numerous film festival awards and had a successful screening tour. Plot The film covers the 2005 edition of the Race Across America. It focuses on several riders, including Jure Robic, Bob Breedlove, Cat Berge, Christopher MacDonald, and Patrick Autissier. From the starting line in San Diego, the film follows the riders across the country as they endure difficult weather, challenging terrain, and sleep deprivation. Several days into the race, Breedlove, a race veteran and endurance cycling legend, is killed in a head-on collision with a pickup truck. The other riders must deal with the aftermath of the accident and decide whether to continue the race. Production Bicycle Dreams was filmed during the 2005 edition of the Race Across America. The crew used 18 cameras, which they embedded within the riders’ crews to get more intimate footage. In an interview about the production, director Stephen Auerbach said he endured stretches of 36 hours without sleep to document the race and to experience the same sleep deprivation as the riders. The crew eventually shot 450 hours of raw footage. Auerbach chose to use little narration in the film, in order to preserve the authenticity of the race and keep the storytelling as “unvarnished” as possible. Reception Bicycle Dreams has received exceptionally positive reviews. USA Today's Sal Ruibal noted that the film has \\"beautiful scenery and inspirational words from riders and coaches\\" while it \\"also probes deeper into the sport's heart of darkness.\\" The film has received a number of film festival awards, including Best Feature Documentary honors at the Yosemite Film Festival, Las Vegas Film Festival, Lake Arrowhead Film Festival, Grand Rapids Film Festival, Solstice Film Festival, Fallbrook Film Festival, Tiburon Film Festival, Red Rock Film Festival, Los Angeles Sports Film Festival, Moscow Sports Film Festival, Canada International Film Festival and the Breckenridge Film Festival.

Other figures from the same era, and with similarly violent or erotic preoccupations, include Maghella, Lucifera, Biancaneve, Vartan, Jacula, Sukia, Jolanda de Almaviva, and Yra.  History  The first comic book was published in 1972. Zora la vampira was published from 1972 to 1985 and featured a blond female protagonist who, on some covers, resembles French actress Catherine Deneuve. The series was published by Edifumetto. The cartoonists were Renzo Barbieri and Giuseppe Pederiali as writers and Birago Balzano as artist. Emanuele Taglietti and Alessandro Biffignandi painted the majority of the covers for the series. Together with the original series, stories of Zora were published also in the comic magazines Orror, I Notturni and Fasma. The series was also published with some success in France, where new stories were produced even after the closing of the series in Italy. A new 13 episodes miniseries of Zora, renamed as \\"Lady Vampyre\\", was published in 2001; cartoonists were Paolo Puccini and Daniele Statella.  Plot  The character's real name is Zora Pabst, a 19th-century aristocrat who has been possessed by the spirit of Dracula. She travels her way around the world and even into outer space, satisfying her sexual desires and lust for blood. Her adventures are a mixture of horror, eroticism, and pornography.

She was portrayed by Claire Chitham and was introduced as a love interest for Nick Harrison who she eventually married 8 years after her arrival to the show. The character returned along with Husband Nick for the show's 25th anniversary episode that aired on 25 May 2017. Creation and casting Waverley arrived as a love interest for Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) and as part of the McKenna family unit. Sixteen-year-old Claire Chitham auditioned for the role and ended up winning it. After several months on the show, producers decided the character of Waverley had run her desired course and she was written off. Chitham believed her time on the soap was over and finished school, started a degree and began acting in other jobs. However, in 1998 Chitham was contacted by the show with a pitch that would see Waverley return in a 3-month stint. Chitham was hugely surprised as nothing of that calibre had happened before in the show and she happily accepted. She stated, \\"It’s good to be back. When you know how the system of this place operates it’s very easy to slip back in, so it feels like I never was away.\\" In 2004 the character of Waverley was axed from the show, alongside husband, Nick. The Harrison family made their last appearance on 17 March 2005. Chitham found it unusual leaving the soap having worked on it for 8 years, \\"I understood at that point I was living in a very extreme world. After eight years in the job I was earning great money, with good opportunities and time to spare. Yet I knew I was perfectly capable of coping with reality, and having been there since I was 18, I didn’t know what my reality was.\\" Following her exit, Chitham was asked to reprise her role but at the time believed she was, \\"on my way to other things\\". For the soap's 25th anniversary, Chitham and Burnett were asked to reprise their roles for a feature-length episode. Chitham described returning as, \\"weird\\" and compared it to being asked, \\"to have sex with an ex\\". Chitham made her reappearance on 25 May 2017. Storylines Waverley arrived to stay with her aunt Alex McKenna (Liddy Holloway) and quickly landed a job at the reception of the clinic. She developed a crush on Stuart Neilson (Martin Henderson) but realised she was too inexperienced sexually and so lost her virginity to Nick (Karl Burnett). But it was not long before Waverley fell for Nick and they became a steady couple. Waverley discovered that Nick had married her cousin Rachel (Angela Bloomfield) in a student protest and fled the country in tears. Waverely returned more than two years later and asked Nick to return to her. However, by the time Nick realised Waverley was the girl for him, her husband Roger (Brett Coutts) arrived and a frustrated Waverley fled town again. She returned several months later and reconciled with Nick and the two got engaged. Waverley discovered that her marriage to Roger was invalid as it was bigamous, but nonetheless, slept with him when he returned. Nick forgave her but when she cut his hair off in his sleep, the relationship ended. Waverley rebounded with his professional rival, Josh Sinclair (Philip Patston) but the relationship was short lived, Waverley dumping Josh after Nick discovered Josh was a part-owner of Waverley's competition, Coffeeteria and that Josh was trying to stoop to dishonest measures to take Waverley over. Waverley began to date Fergus (Paul Ellis), but the two broke up and she briefly dated Jed Ferris (Johnny Barker) before she reunited with Fergus. The two prepared to marry, but on the wedding day police arrived to arrest Fergus for his part in an illegal immigration and he fled. Waverley moved on to Adam Heywood (Leighton Cardno) but realised she still loved Nick. The two finally reconciled and married. However the happiness was brief when Waverley discovered she had breast cancer. Nick supported her through the ordeal and she fell pregnant, only to suffer a miscarriage. Waverley eventually fell pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter named Tina-Anne (Libby Reber). When Waverley and Nick's house was broken into, the family decided to leave Ferndale for Taranaki. Waverley discovered Nick had misplaced the marriage certificate on their wedding day and their marriage could be invalid as Nick made a copy but subsequently Nick organised a vowel renewal shortly before the Harrison's left Ferndale. Nick and Waverley returned for Chris' 50th birthday and revealed that they had since had 3 more children since Tina-Anne. Arguing over Waverley's wish for Nick to undergo a vasectomy, the couple helped out as Ferndale was hit with a volcanic eruption. The two were shocked to discover that Waverley was again pregnant but came to be happy following wisdom from Marj (Elizabeth McRae) before she died moments later. Character development =Relationship with Nick Harrison= Waverley was introduced to the show as a love interest for established character, Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett). Waverley at first used Nick to get to Stuart Neilson (Martin Henderson), but it was not long before something more serious developed. In 1995 the couple had a pregnancy scare and Nick nervously proposed to Waverley before they found out it was a mistake and he retracted his action. Waverley was devastated to learn Nick had married her cousin Rachel (Angela Bloomfield) during a protest on student allowance and she fled the country. Chitham and Burnett got on well, something which benefitted the couples onscreen relationship, Chitham stated, \\"Karl’s lovely. He’s very good to work with... I think we’ve got a really good rapport going – you have to if you’re playing a couple on screen.\\" Upon returning after 3 years in 1998, Waverley hoped that Nick had made a substantial change, Chitham stated, \\"Waverley wants him to have grown up and sorted himself out, have a respectable job and be a man – a suitable man to be her partner and she won’t settle for anything less. She sticks to her morals really strongly and that is one of the aspects in which I think she’s grown up a lot.\\" Speaking of Nick's attempts to meet Waverleys demands, Chitham said, \\"He makes an effort to meet her requirements. We get there in the end.\\" The two became engaged but Nick was devastated when Waverley cut his trademark hair whilst they slept and they broke up. Just over a year later, Nick's partner Angela Weaver (Katherine Hubbard) died, leaving him with the care of their son, Lucas (Joshua Adams). Waverley looked after the baby alongside Rachel. As 2001 came to an end, Nick announced his love to Waverley. Waverley turned him down and Nick left Ferndale for England so that Burnett could take a sabbatical. When he returned, Nick and Waverley finally reconciled and got engaged. The wedding was cancelled however when Waverley's ex fiancé, Fergus Kearney (Paul Ellis) kidnapped her on the day of the ceremony. She was rescued however and the two finally married in an episode marked by the return of original characters, Jenny Harrison (Maggie Harper) and Marj Brasch (Elizabeth McRae). The following year Waverley was diagnosed with breast cancer and did not tell Nick. Waverley recovered and soon fell pregnant, giving birth to a daughter, Tina-Anne Harrison (Damikah Chancher) on the shows 3000th episode. A fire at Nick and Wave's bar, 'The Dog's Day Inn', nearly saw an end to Lucas and Tina-Anne, but both were rescued by Wave's cousin Eltham Wilson (Kip Chapman). In 2005, the couple's home was struck by a home invader and an increasingly paranoid Nick mistook Wave for a burglar and shook a gun at her. As a result of their insecurities, the Harrison's left Ferndale for Taranaki. Reception Waverely received a hugely positive reception, being labelled one of the shows most; \\"enduringly popular characters\\".

She was easy to fall in love with, and to play. She had a heart of gold and was harmless. And the best thing was she was this really great comic character.
