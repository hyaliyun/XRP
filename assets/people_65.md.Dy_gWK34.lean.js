It starts near the village of Peza and runs for about towards the north and parallel to Kounaviano gorge. The two gorges meet at Kaki Rachi near the village of Skalani (el), forming the Karteros gorge. Astrakiano gorge can be entered at various locations along its length, i.e. Peza, Kato Astraki, Agies Paraskies, Aitania. Karteros river flows through the gorge. Features Astrakiano gorge has lush vegetation that includes plane trees, willows, kermes oaks and fig trees. Certain of its parts are not well-signed and difficult to cross. Near the abandoned village of Kato Astraki, the gorge is spanned by a stone arch bridge known as Astrakiani Kamara (ŒëœÉœÑœÅŒ±Œ∫ŒπŒ±ŒΩŒÆ ŒöŒ±ŒºŒ¨œÅŒ±), built in the early 20th century.

Problems with the Peugeot engine in the previous Voisin VIII led to the installation of a new Renault engine of greater power and reliability, but the new aircraft was otherwise nearly identical to the VIII.Davilla, p.557 Despite its obsolescence, it would make up the bulk of front line night bomber escadrilles until the end of the war. Development With the failure of the 1915 and 1916 bomber contests to produce any usable types to replace the Voisin V, Voisin was asked to produce an interim type pending the development of the next generation of bombers.Davilla, p.559 This began with the Voisin VII which was itself an enlarged V, but was underpowered, and was soon followed by the Voisin VIII, which suffered severe reliability problems. As with the VIII, two versions were to be built, a night bomber, and an aircraft armed with a large single shot Hotchkiss cannon. By the time the X appeared, the cannon had been found to be of little use and most of those built as LBR/Ca.2s were converted into bombers with the cannons removed. Those LBRs fitted with the cannon had the pilot in the rear seat, while in the LAR, the pilot sat in the front seat, while the rear occupant could be equipped with a light machine gun such as a Lewis. On some aircraft, the observer's gun was mounted on a ring that was inclined forward to make movement forward easier against the wind. Like the previous Voisins going back to the Voisin III, the Voisin VIII had a steel tube structure to provide adequate strength, covered with aluminium sheet on the fuselage nacelle and doped fabric on the flying surfaces. The fuselage was square in section, with no attempt at reducing drag. The 3-bay wings had a constant chord and square tips, and the top wings were slightly greater in span than the lower wings. The cruciform tail was mounted on booms which tapered in plan view to a vertical knife edge that formed the rudder post. The all-flying rudder and elevator were aerodynamically balanced and had no fixed surfaces. Unusually for the period, and because it had no skid to drag it to a stop, it was equipped with drum brakes on the rear wheels. Like the Voisin VIII, the X was fitted with two large strut mounted teardrop fuel tanks that could be jettisoned in the event of a fire. Also, as with the VIII, the X was usually fitted with tall individual exhaust stacks projecting above the top wing. Due to the change from a V-8 to a V-12 there were additional stacks, and some examples had a muffler installed. A small additional aerodynamic counterbalance was sometimes also added at the bottom of the rudder. Operational history=French service= The first Voisin X's entered service with VB.114 in late 1917.Davilla, p.563 Due to their poor performance relative to contemporary fighters, when opposition was anticipated, operations were carried out at night. Voisin X's were used primarily as night bombers, attacking both strategic targets such as railyards, as well as carrying out tactical missions, such as suppressing enemy troop movements.Davilla, pp.564-566 7 Bombing Groups (Groupes de Bombardment) were formed for this purpose. Voisin X's were also used for night reconnaissance, for which 6 escadrilles were specifically formed for this role.Davilla, pp.563-564 Beginning in July 1918, the Voisin began being supplemented by the Farman F.50 in French front-line service, with surviving aircraft being transferred to newly created second line units, however examples remained in front line service until after the armistice.Davilla, p.565 Examples still equipped a number of units in 1920 but by then in the process of being wound down. =Aerochir= While the British and Americans experimented with aerial ambulances, carrying a single stretcher in a Curtiss Jenny or Airco DH.4, in France, a Voisin X was converted into a complete mobile flying hospital, the Aerochir, complete with X-ray machines and other modern equipment for a full service operating room, so as to better support the mobile battlefield conditions created by the introduction of tank warfare. =Drone/autopilot= In 1918, a Voisin X made a fully automated 100 km flight without human assistance.de Fouchier, 1978, pp.1-4 A pilot was carried as a backup but wasn't found to be necessary. Four Sperry gyroscopes actuated electrical servo motors which controlled the flight surfaces and the engine throttle. During the flight, it changed altitude and direction multiple times, based on a preprogrammed course set with a series of switches. Testing resumed in 1923, for intended use as an auto-pilot.

He is the founder, president, and CEO of EDWINS Leadership and Restaurant Institute, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that acts as both a French restaurant and a culinary institute located in Cleveland's Shaker Square. It trains and is staffed largely by former prison inmates and was the subject of the 2017 Academy Award-nominated documentary short, Knife Skills. Chrostowski is also a certified sommelier and a fromager. He ran for Mayor of Cleveland in 2017. Early life and education Chrostowski was born and grew up in Detroit, Michigan. When he was 18, he was charged with resisting arrest after originally being suspected of a drug-related offense. A judge could have imposed a 10-year prison term but instead sentenced Chrostowski to one year of probation. Soon after this, he began working with Detroit chef, George Kalergis, who became his mentor. This led him to The Culinary Institute of America in New York where he earned an associate's degree in culinary arts and a bachelor's degree in business and restaurant management. Career=2000‚Äì2007: Early career in Chicago, Paris, and New York= After finishing his studies, Chrostowski apprenticed under Charlie Trotter at his namesake restaurant (Charlie Trotter's) in Chicago. He then moved to France where he worked under Jean Bardet in Tours and Alain Senderens in Paris. For six months, he held a position at the Entree chaud and patisserie station at Senderens' Paris restaurant, Lucas Carton. Around 2005, he returned to the United States, working as saucier at Terrance Brennan's Manhattan restaurant, Picholine. He also worked in the kitchens at Le Cirque and Chanterelle in Manhattan. He worked his way up to manager at the latter restaurant, which was owned by Karen and David Waltuck. In 2007, Chrostowski incorporated the 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, EDWINS Leadership and Restaurant Institute. He had originally written a business plan for the organization in 2004 with the goal of offering professional culinary training, housing, clothing, counseling, and life-skills classes to current and former inmates. The name comes from Chrostowski's own middle name (Edwin), which he inherited from his grandfather. It is also shorthand for \\"Education Wins.\\" Chrostowski moved to Cleveland in around 2008. While there, he earned a job as a manager at the French brasserie, L'Albatros. He would later become the restaurant's sommelier, fromager, and general manager. =2008‚Äì2016: Life in Cleveland and founding EDWINS= While working at L'Albatros, Chrostowski began to raise money for his EDWINS venture via fundraisers and private donations. Initially, he developed an EDWINS program for currently imprisoned inmates at the Grafton Correctional Institution and the Northeast Pre-Release Center, which he began in 2011. In September 2012, Chrostowski publicly revealed his business plan in an effort to garner more donations. In March 2013 at a TED Talk in Cleveland, he gave a speech about the difficulties former inmates face after being released from prison. He also announced that he would resign from his position at L'Albatros to focus exclusively on EDWINS. In July 2013, he purchased a building in Cleveland's Shaker Square and began renovating it to accommodate the restaurant and training center. The restaurant opened in November 2013 and was staffed by around 55 former inmates at its outset. A total of about 80 students entered the initial class with about 35 \\"graduating\\" the six-month program. By September 2015, the program had graduated 89 students. In November of that year, Chrostowski was listed on Crain's Cleveland Business \\"Forty Under 40\\" list. In March 2016, he was named one of 25 CNN Heroes for that year. In August 2016, the EDWINS Second Chance Life Skills Center‚Äîa campus composed of three buildings with dormitories, a library, a test kitchen, and fitness center‚Äîwas completed. Chrostowski had acquired the buildings for the project in Cleveland's Buckeye neighborhood in July 2015. The center is reserved for current members and alumni of the EDWINS program. In January 2017, Chrostowski appeared on an episode of Steve Harvey where he was honored as one of \\"Harvey's Heroes.\\" =2017‚Äìpresent: Mayoral run and restaurant expansion= In February 2017, Chrostowski announced his candidacy for the Mayor of Cleveland. To focus on his campaign, he took a leave of absence from EDWINS, appointing Tom Nobbe to temporarily fill his role. In the September primary election, Chrostowski finished fourth out of nine candidates, accruing 9.5% of the vote and losing to long-time incumbent, Frank G. Jackson. He returned to his position as President of EDWINS soon after the election. That year, EDWINS was also the subject of the Thomas Lennon-directed documentary short, Knife Skills. Chrostowski had met Lennon at a dinner party held by his former Chanterelle bosses, Karen and David Waltuck, in September 2013. He later agreed to let Lennon film the run-up to the restaurant's launch. The film largely focuses on EDWINS' opening night in November 2013 along with Chrostowski and the restaurant's trainees. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject at the 90th Academy Awards. In January 2018, Chrostowski led a group of EDWINS trainees preparing a dinner of fine French cuisine at the James Beard House in Manhattan. In March 2018, Chrostowski opened the Serenite Restaurant and Culinary Institute in Medina, Ohio. The restaurant operates similarly to EDWINS but has a focus on individuals recovering from drug and/or alcohol addictions. The center received a $300,000 grant from the state of Ohio to start the restaurant. Chrostowski has finished the EDWINS Butcher Shop and Cafe near the EDWINS Second Chance Life Skills Center. It opened in December 2018. Over the course of its existence, the EDWINS program has graduated over 350 former inmates, and EDWINS culinary classes are held in virtually all Ohio prisons. In July 2019 Chrostowski opened up an Italian eatery helping the homeless. In partnership with the West Side Catholic Center the social enterprise launched on July 19, 2019. Chrostowski has continued his pursuit of building the best culinary school for returning citizens by opening the EDWINS Bakery on December 20, 2019. This fresh bakery and \\"from scratch\\" diner provides a deeper baking and pastry education to students and provides fresh baked goods that \\"feed the soul\\" of the nearby community. Because of the commitment that Chrostowski has for the community and excellence exhibited in culinary arts he was recognized by the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association (IFMA) in March 2020 and named a recipient of the prestigous Silver Plate award.

In the book, Nixey argues that early Christians deliberately destroyed classical Greek and Roman cultures and caused the Dark Ages. Despite popular success, the book received extensive criticism from professional scholars of late antiquity and the Middle Ages, who accused it of telling a simplistic, polemical narrative and exaggerating the extent to which early Christians suppressed aspects of older Greek and Roman cultures. Content After expressing the opinion that traditional historical narratives tend to depict pre-Christian Rome in an unfavorable light (chilly and nihilistic), Nixey proceeds to describe what she sees as an attack by Christians against classical heritage during Late Antiquity, which is a period generally encompassing the late Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages. The assault she alleges is both physical and cultural, taking the reader from the murder of Hypatia in 415 and the destruction of pagan statues, to the closing of temples and destruction of books. For Nixey, these episodes of violent religious zeal are explained by a widely promoted belief that pagan religions actually harbored demons, and also by the powerful rhetoric Christian leaders used against the enemies of the early church. In that sense, she thinks the foundations of later religious persecution were laid at that time. Reception=Among the general public= The Darkening Age was chosen as one of The New York Times' \\"Notable Books\\" for 2018 and was listed on \\"book of the year\\" lists by The Telegraph, The Spectator, The Observer, and BBC History. =Among scholars= Peter Thonemann, a professor of ancient history at the University of Oxford, argues that Nixey's work is problematic, and that \\"the argument depends on quite a bit of nifty footwork\\", because Nixey makes a large number of broad generalizations based on limited evidence. He also states that the deliberate destruction of ancient temples by Christians \\"seems to have been exceptionally rare in real life\\" and that the Christian book- burning was always directed towards heretical or \\"magical\\" writing, and not towards classical literature. Professor Tim Whitmarsh of Cambridge University described it as \\"a finely crafted, invigorating polemic against the resilient popular myth that presents the Christianisation of Rome as the triumph of a kinder, gentler politics. On those terms, it succeeds brilliantly\\". He also cautions that the work risks being one-sided. He said it represented a reversion to Edward Gibbon's view of the Christians as instigators of the fall of Rome. \\"In seeking to expose the error and corruption of the early Christian world, Nixey comes close to veiling the pre-Christian Romans‚Äô own barbarous qualities,\\" he said. Johannes (Hans) van Oort, a Dutch Professor of Patristics and Gnostic Studies at Radboud University, states that Nixey \\"is replaying her hand with her fierce tone and gross exaggeration\\" and that her book \\"lacks any historical structure\\". Van Oort also writes that Nixey doesn‚Äôt understand some historical contexts and that she \\"makes some serious historical slips\\". Levi Roach, a medievalist of University of Exeter, states that Nixey‚Äôs book \\"does not seek to present a balanced picture\\" and that it is \\"a book of generalisations\\". He also states, \\"Nixey ends up endorsing the long-debunked view of the Middle Ages as a period of blind faith and intellectual stagnation\\". Richard Tada, Ph.D. in ancient Greek and Byzantine history from the University of Washington, states that Nixey ventured \\"into areas where she is clearly out of her depth\\" and as result her book is \\"a shoddy work that fails to make the grade even as a polemic\\", and that one of Nixey's attempts to blame Christians for the supposedly destruction of classical world is \\"simply dishonest\\", where she misrepresents both primary and secondary sources.

Matagot also produced a Collector's Edition which features deluxe, over-sized pieces and game board. Premise and Gameplay Players control the gardener of the Japanese Emperor's bamboo garden, as well as its resident panda, a gift from the Emperor of China. At the start of the game, the board consists only of the central pond of the bamboo garden - players take turns to plant new hexagonal bamboo plots (three colours green, yellow and pink), as well as to add irrigation and improvements to the plots, move the gardener to grow bamboo, and move the panda who eats the bamboo. =Turn structure= On each turn, players can choose between a number of different actions; laying a new plot on the garden, taking an irrigation channel from the stock, moving the gardener, moving the panda, or drawing a new objective card. On a regular turn, each player can pick any two of those actions. However, there is also a die that determines the weather conditions for the round - sunny (pick three actions rather than two), rainy (choose a plot to grow more bamboo), storm (move the panda to any location), windy (can select same action twice) or cloudy (choose an improvement to place on a plot). =Objective cards= Players earn points by completing objective cards, which belong to one of three categories: * Plot cards require a certain arrangement of coloured plots to be present on the garden. All plots must be irrigated in order to count. * Gardener objective cards require certain colours of bamboo to be grown to various heights. * Panda objectives require the panda to have eaten certain amounts of different colours of bamboo on that player's turns. Players start the game with one objective card from each category, and can have up to a maximum of five in their hand. Cards have different point values, depending how difficult that particular objective is to complete. Plot and gardener objectives can be completed by either player; it is possible for a player to unknowingly complete an opponent's objectives through their placement of tiles, or movement of the gardener. However, panda objectives can only be completed by using the bamboo collected by that player. The first player to reach a certain number of completed objectives (9 in a two-player game, 8 in a three-player game) receives a bonus Emperor card worth 2 points, and triggers the last round of the game.

He rose to popularity in 2012 with his album Blank Banshee 0, which combined traditional elements of vaporwave with trap music, a style now known as vaportrap. Blank Banshee's music has been described as a ‚Äúbalance of abstract ambience and dance-able trap‚Äù.

Beginning on the eve of the album's release, a series of six self-produced computer animated music videos were uploaded to the official Blank Banshee YouTube channel.

Founded in 2015 under a mandate by the United Nations Secretary-General, it provides an independent review of progress on the implementation of the Global Strategy for Women‚Äôs, Children‚Äôs and Adolescents‚Äô Health (2016-30) ‚Äî‚Äì from the specific lens of who is accountable to whom, for what and how. It is composed of an autonomous group of internationally recognized experts and leaders appointed by the UN Secretary-General in 2016.

The Accountability Framework  The IAP framework builds on the framework previously used by the Commission on Information and Accountability (CoIA) and the independent Expert Review Group (iERG), but draws on international human rights law, which lies at the core of the Global Strategy and is set out in instruments accepted by states through intergovernmental processes. The IAP extends the monitor, review and act framework articulated by CoIA to monitor, review, act and remedy. This framework recognizes existing legal accountability mechanisms at national level (e.g. courts and national human rights institutions, and others already listed in the revised Global Strategy, such as parliamentarians, civil society organizations, development partners and private sector actors) and international level (e.g. UN treaty- monitoring bodies, regional bodies and the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review). Including act and remedy makes the accountability framework consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which notably sets out the importance of rule of law and access to justice to achieve sustainable peace and development (Sustainable Development Goal 16). This includes equal access to justice for all, and developing effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.

She went on to doctoral studies at the University of Mississippi, where she became president of the Graduate Student Council and earned a second master's degree there along the way in 2004. She completed her Ph.D. at the University of Mississippi in 2006. Her dissertation concerned matroid theory; it was Clones and Minors in Matroids, with T. James Reid as her doctoral advisor. She was the second African-American woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics at the university, and was part of a group of four African-Americans who all graduated in the same year. Career After completing her doctorate, Cotwright-Williams worked as a tenure-track faculty member in mathematics at Wake Forest University, Hampton University, and Norfolk State University. While working there, in an effort to shift her career to a government track, she began studying public policy and working on collaborative research on Bayesian network based drone control systems with NASA, and on a US Navy project involving measurement uncertainty. In 2010, she completed a Graduate Certificate in Public Policy Analysis at Old Dominion University. She applied for an American Mathematical Society Congressional Fellowship, and was turned down on her first application but succeeded in her second, in 2012. While a Congressional Fellow she worked as a staffer on the majority staff of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and her responsibilities included responding to the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. In 2014 she worked on data quality for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and in 2015 she became Hardy-Apfel IT Fellow at the Social Security Administration. Her work at the Social Security Administration has included business analytics to prevent fraud and support data warehousing. In 2018, with the fellowship expiring, she moved again to the United States Department of Defense as a data scientist. Cotwright-Williams continues to hold an adjunct professorial lecturer position in mathematics and statistics at American University. She is the Outside of Academia Member in the National Association of Mathematicians. Her work has earned her recognition by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2017 Honoree.

Tennessee voters chose 12 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background and vote For over a century after the Civil War, Tennessee‚Äôs white citizenry was divided according to partisan loyalties established in that war. Unionist regions covering almost all of East Tennessee, Kentucky Pennyroyal-allied Macon County, and the five West Tennessee Highland Rim counties of Carroll, Henderson, McNairy, Hardin and WayneWright, John K.; ‚ÄòVoting Habits in the United States: A Note on Two Maps‚Äô; Geographical Review, vol. 22, no. 4 (October 1932), pp. 666-672 voted Republican ‚Äì generally by landslide margins ‚Äì as they saw the Democratic Party as the ‚Äúwar party‚Äù who had forced them into a war they did not wish to fight.Key (Jr.), Valdimer Orlando; Southern Politics in State and Nation (New York, 1949), pp. 282-283 Contrariwise, the rest of Middle and West Tennessee who had supported and driven the state‚Äôs secession was equally fiercely Democratic as it associated the Republicans with Reconstruction.Lyons, William; Scheb (II), John M. and Stair Billy; Government and Politics in Tennessee, pp. 183-184 After the state‚Äôs white landowning class re-established its rule in the early 1870s, black and Unionist white combined to forge adequate support for the GOP to produce a competitive political system for two decades,Kousser, J. Morgan; The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One- Party South, 1880-1910, p. 104 although during this era the Republicans could only capture statewide offices when the Democratic Party was divided on this issue of payment of state debt. White Democrats in West Tennessee were always aiming to eliminate black political influence, and during the 1880s they attempted to do this by election fraud and stuffing of ballot boxes.Kousser; The Shaping of Southern Politics, p. 110 During the 1888 elections, this fraud increased substantially and the GOP‚Äôs fortures showed a decline at the state level to just 35 out of 132 state legislators.Kousser, J. Morgan; ‚ÄòPost- Reconstruction Suffrage Restrictions in Tennessee: A New Look at the V. O. Key Thesis‚Äô; Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 88, No. 4 (December 1973), pp. 655-683 This would lead to much more drastic changes in the future, but in the presidential race Democratic nominee and incumbent President Grover Cleveland, running with the former Senator and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio Allen G. Thurman won only 52.26 percent of the popular vote, against former Indiana Senator Benjamin Harrison (R-Indiana), running with Levi P. Morton, the 31st governor of New York who gained 45.76 percent. Cleveland‚Äôs margin was, given the political changes taking place, only a small improvement over his 1884 win in Tennessee; however, he did re-establish the majority-black far southwestern part of the state as rock-ribbed Democratic until the party turned towards Civil Rights under Harry S. Truman. The Union Labor Party chose Alson Streeter, a former Illinois state representative, and Charles E. Cunningham as their presidential and vice-presidential candidates and received 0.02% of the vote. The Prohibition Party ran brigadier general Clinton B. Fisk and John A. Brooks and received 1.97% of the vote.

The country would not however, have complete independence, only achieving full independence from the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991. Observances The Freedom Celebration or the May 4 Freedom Celebration is an annual military parade in Latvia which has been held since 2012 in honor of the Day of the Restoration of Latvian Independence. It is one of the main events of the day. The parade is usually the first of two full military parades held per year in the country, with the other being held on November 11, Latvia's independence day. Every year, the parade is held in various Latvian cities outside of the capital of Riga. The parade usually starts at 11:00 am and typically involves around between 500-1,000 troops of the Latvian National Armed Forces, including personnel representing the Land Forces, Navy, Air Force, National Guard, State Border Guard, Special Tasks Unit, Military Police and military academies. Being a NATO member, the parade also features military servicemen from NATO countries such as the United States, Canada and Germany.

As per the Riga celebrations, a flower laying ceremony is always held at the capital's Freedom Monument. The NAF Staff Band at a flower laying ceremony at the Freedom Monument in 2016. In 2016 an initiative called \\"White Tablecloth Day\\" () was launched by the Ministry of Culture in context of Latvian Centennial celebration (2018) inviting people of all communities to gather around a table and celebrate together. The goal of White Tablecloth Celebration is to strengthen the tradition of gathering family, friends, neighbours, and communities around the table on 4 May to consciously celebrate our country and honour those who helped to create and protect it. We generate the feeling of celebration together on White Tablecloth Day as each person brings something to add to the table and to the conversation. White Tablecloth Day is a reminder that the restoration of the independence of the Republic of Latvia was the result of relentless action, courage and audacity of certain individuals.

He was also an amateur sailor and navigator.  Biography  He originally wanted to join the Navy, but his family refused permission, so he searched for another occupation that would allow him to travel and chose painting. He became a student of Barth√©lemy Menn, whose style left permanent traces in Pal√©zieux's work. Menn also encouraged him to practice painting en plein aire. Later, he went to Paris, where he studied with Jean-Paul Laurens and made the acquaintance of Fernand Cormon. After a brief visit to D√ºsseldorf, he returned home and married Lily Olmsted, with whom he had a daughter. His family made frequent visits to Brittany and Normandy. Many of his works were inspired by sights on the shores of Lake Geneva. Lost (1909) During the 1880s, he made numerous trips to Paris, where he socialized with some of his fellow painters from Switzerland, including Eug√®ne Burnand, Charles Giron and Evert van Muyden. He also held regular exhibitions at the Salon des artistes fran√ßais, which received generally good reviews. In 1903, after separating from his wife, he settled permanently in √âquihen-Plage, near Boulogne-sur-Mer. Four years later, after his divorce was finalized, he married Suzanne Lair. This marriage produced no children. In 1910, he was named a Chevalier in the French Legion of HonorChevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur. The First World War forced him and his wife to remove themselves from their proximity to the battle zones. They spent time in Vevey, near Lake Annecy and in the south of France; Collioure in particular, but also in Antibes and Saint-Jean-de-Luz. He left each of these places with numerous new maritime paintings and sketches. They were finally able to return to √âquihen-Plage in 1919, and he remained there for the rest of his life. In his final years, he displayed some nostalgia for his homeland; notably a painting entitled \\"Souvenir de r√©gates\\" (now lost), where he depicts himself manning a racing boat in Lake Geneva. He was interred in the village cemetery.Jacqueline Duroc, \\"Peintres des Iles de Bretagne - de lointains visiteurs...\\", in Les Cahiers de l'Iroise, #162, 1994.. A major retrospective was held at the Lake Geneva Museum in 2014. In addition to his paintings, several of his working models were displayed.  The sailor  The Rescue Ship (1885) He had been passionate about sailing and navigating since he was a young boy and learned how to manage a sailboat at the age of twelve. Although his family was opposed to sailing as a career, he took boats out on Lake Geneva as often as possible. In 1888, he commanded the \\"Petrel\\", a ship belonging to Baron Jules de Catus (1838-1910), who was a naval architect. In 1890, he had a ship built and named it the \\"Flirt\\". It was a racing boat which he used to participate in regattas on Lake Geneva.Article by Philippe Mayerat in Chasse-mar√©e, March 1999. His involvement in sailing can be seen in his works, where there is a meticulous accuracy of detail, not only in the boats themselves, but in the navigational maneuvers as well.

Following their promotion in the 1993‚Äì94 season this was their sixth consecutive season in the highest tier of Swiss football. Ren√© C. J√§ggi was the club's chairman for the fourth year. FC Basel played their home games in the Stadion Sch√ºtzenmatte while the new stadium was being built.  Overview  On 15 June 1999 Christian Gross was appointed as the new first team trainer and he assigned Ruedi Zbinden as his co-trainer. Forming his new team, Gross made a number of signings before the season started. These new signings included defensive players such as Alexandre Quennoz, who signed from Sion, Ivan Knez from Luzern and Murat Yakin who came from Fenerbah√ße and forwards such as George Koumantarakis who signed in from Luzern, Didier Tholot from Sion and Thomas H√§berli from Kriens. The most interest was raised in the signing of Pascal Zuberb√ºhler in a goalkeeper swap with Stefan Huber who then went to Grasshopper Club. In the outwards direction Mario Frick transferred to Z√ºrich, Abedi to Yverdon and Fabrice Henry to Hibernian (on loan).  The Campaign = Domestic League = The qualifying round of the League season 1999‚Äì2000 was contested by twelve teams. The first eight teams of the First Stage (or Qualification) were then to compete in the Championship Round. The season started on 7 July. Basel's priority aim was to reach the Championship stage and end the season in the top three. The season started sub-optimal, the team remained unbeaten, but with just three wins and four draws in the first seven rounds, they lost contact to the table leaders. Following their first defeat, in the away game against Lausanne-Sport, Basel improved their position in the table with another three victories. Basel suffered their first home defeat on 2 October against Yverdon-Sports, but they ended the Qualification Round in second position in the league table. The Championship Round started on 12 March 2000. The participating teams took half of the points (rounded up to complete units) gained in the Qualification as bonus with them. Basel played amongst the table leaders and in the tenth round they even managed a 3‚Äì1 victory against league leaders St. Gallen. However, in their last four matches Basel won only two further points and dropped to third position behind champions St Gallen and Lausanne, against whom the final game of the season ended in a 0‚Äì3 home defeat on 7 June 2000. Nevertheless, Basel qualified for the 2000‚Äì01 UEFA Cup. = Domestic Cup = Basel's clear aim for the Swiss Cup was to win the title. In the round of 32, they were drawn away against Mendrisio. In the next round a home game against Grasshopper Club, ended in a draw and was eventually won in the penalty shoot out. The quarterfinal against Lausanne ended the cup run. = Europe = Basel were qualified for the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup. The first round was played against Slovenian team Korotan Prevalje on 20 and 26 June 1999 and won 6‚Äì0 on aggregate. The second round draw brought the Czech Republic club Boby Brno to Basel on 4 July. The return leg a week later gave Basel a 4‚Äì2 victory on aggregate. Although the first leg of the third round was won away from home against Hamburg, the Germans won the second leg in the Stadion Sch√ºtzenmatte and Hamburg proceeded due to the away goals rule.

He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1922, joined the Foreign Office as assistant legal adviser in 1925, and was promoted second legal adviser in 1929. He played a key role in the 1930 League of Nations Codification Conference and in relation to the abolition of the capitulatory regime in Egypt in 1934. He advised the British government during the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, and played an important part in the first three assemblies of the United Nations. Beckett became Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office in 1945, succeeding Sir William Malkin. As Legal Adviser, Beckett was responsible for a heavy litigation program involving the United Kingdom. He led the British legal team in the Corfu Channel case, the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries case, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company case, and participated in many others. He retired due to illness in 1953. Beckett became a CMG in 1931, a King's Counsel in 1946 and was promoted to KCMG in 1948.  Family  Beckett married Katharine Mary Richards, younger daughter of the international lawyer Sir Henry Erle Richards, in 1925; they had two sons and one daughter.

In the United States, some form of workers compensation is typically compulsory for almost all employers in most states (depending upon the features of the organization), with the notable exception of Texas as of 2018. Regardless of compulsory requirements, businesses may purchase insurance voluntarily, and in the United States policies typically include Part One for compulsory coverage and Part Two for non-compulsory coverage. By 1949, every state had enacted a workers' compensation program.eh.net Fishback Includes extended data tables.  History  The Workers‚Äô Accident Insurance system put into place by Otto von Bismarck in 1881 is often cited as a model for Europe and later the United States. The system was motivated by an \\"unholy trinity\\" of tort defenses available to employers, including contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and the fellow servant rule. In 1855, Georgia and Alabama passed Employer Liability Acts; 26 other states passed similar acts between 1855 and 1907. Early laws permitted injured employees to sue the employer and then prove a negligent act or omission.Google Scholar re: THE EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY CASES, 207 U.S. 463 (1908) (A similar scheme was set forth in Britain's 1880 Act.lawphil.net \\"The Employers' Liability Act of Alabama, first enacted in 1855 (Civil Code 1907, Ch. 80, sec. 3910), is a substantial, if not an exact copy, of the English Act of 1880.\\") Statewide workers' compensation laws were passed in New York in 1898, Maryland in 1902, Massachusetts in 1908, and Montana in 1909. The first law covering federal employees was passed in 1906.The Federal Employers Liability Law of 1906 The 1906 law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court; re-worked by Congress in 1908 (See: FELA, 1908; FECA, 1916; Kern, 1918.) These laws were later struck down in the courts as unconstitutional. In 1911, Wisconsin became the first state to pass a comprehensive law that was not successfully challenged in the courts. By 1949, every state had enacted a workers' compensation program.eh.net Fishback Includes extended data tables. Workers‚Äô compensation laws adopted in the early 20th century were voluntary (employers were not compelled to purchase workers‚Äô compensation). It was argued that compulsory participation laws were unconstitutional and violated the 14th amendment, which required due process before a person or entity could be deprived of property. In 1917 the issue of due process was resolved by the United States Supreme Court in New York Central Railway Co. v. White which held that an employer's due process rights were not impeded by mandatory workers' compensation. Following this ruling, each state instituted different threshold requirements. The adoption of the workers‚Äô compensation laws led to changes in how workplace accidents are compensated. Compensation is no longer based on the worker showing that the employer was at fault, nor can compensation be denied if the worker‚Äôs negligence contributes to the injury. Nearly all employers are required to have insurance to cover payments for: (1) medical costs resulting from occupational injuries and some occupational illnesses suffered by workers; and (2) partial replacement of injured or ill workers‚Äô lost wages, also known as indemnity.  Modern practice  In the United States, most employees who are injured on the job receive medical care responsive to the workplace injury, and, in some cases, payment to compensate for resulting disabilities. Generally, an injury that occurs when an employee is on their way to or from work does not qualify for workers' compensation benefits; however, there are some exceptions if your responsibilities demand that you be in multiple locations, or stay in the course of your employment after work hours. There are two methods by which an employer can comply with its obligation to provide workers' compensation coverage for its employees. Very large organizations and governments may choose to \\"self-insure\\" in which the organization obtains permission from the workers' compensation agency to pay claims directly, without being required to carry insurance. Smaller organizations must, and self-insured organizations may, purchase a workers' compensation insurance policy to cover obligations for work-related injuries to employees. Some self-insured organizations will use a \\"hybrid\\" approach, hiring an insurance company to investigate workers' compensation claims, but paying the claims itself out of its own pockets. Note that being self-insured is not the same as being uninsured. A self-insured organization has permission from a state agency to not carry workers' compensation insurance, generally because the organization is large enough and has enough assets to cover claims on its own. In almost all States, having employees without either being authorized to self-insure or carrying workers' compensation insurance is a serious crime, punishable by fines and imprisonment. Insurance policies are available to employers through commercial insurance companies: if the employer is deemed an excessive risk to insure at market rates, it can obtain coverage through an assigned-risk program. In many states, there are public uninsured employer funds to pay benefits to workers employed by companies who illegally fail to purchase insurance. Various organizations focus resources on providing education and guidance to workers' compensation administrators and adjudicators in various state and national workers' compensation systems. These include the American Bar Association (ABA), the International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions (IAIABC), the National Association of Workers' Compensation Judiciary (NAWCJ), and the Workers Compensation Research Institute. In the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2010 National Compensation Survey, workers' compensation costs represented 1.6% of employer spending overall, although rates varied significantly across industry sectors. For instance, workers' compensation accounted for 4.4% of employer spending in the construction industry, 1.8% in manufacturing and 1.3% in services. Clinical outcomes for patients with workers' compensation tend to be worse compared to those non- workers' compensation patients among those undergoing upper extremity surgeries, and have found they tend to take longer to return to their jobs and tend to return to work at lower rates. Factors that might explain this outcome include this patient population having strenuous upper extremity physical demands, and a possible financial gain from reporting significant post- operative disability. State laws As each state within the United States has its own workers' compensation laws, the circumstances under which workers' compensation is available to workers, the amount of benefits that a worker may receive, and the duration of the benefits paid to an injured worker, vary by state. The workers' compensation system is administered on a state-by-state basis, with a state governing board overseeing varying public/private combinations of workers' compensation systems. The names of such governing boards, or \\"quasi-judicial agencies,\\" vary from state to state, many being designated as \\"workers' compensation commissions\\". In North Carolina, the state entity responsible for administering the workers' compensation system is referred to as the North Carolina Industrial Commission. In a majority of states, workers' compensation is solely provided by private insurance companies. Twelve states operate state funds (that serve as models to private insurers and insures state employees), and a handful of states have state- owned monopoly insurance providers. To keep state funds from crowding out private insurers, the state funds may be required to act as assigned-risk programs or insurers of last resort for businesses that cannot obtain coverage from a private insurer. In contrast, private insurers can turn away the worst risks and may also write comprehensive insurance packages covering general liability, natural disasters, and other forms of insurance coverage. Of the twelve state funds, the largest is California's State Compensation Insurance Fund. = Reporting = Underreporting of injuries is a significant problem in the workers' compensation system. Workers, fearing retaliation from their employers, may avoid reporting injuries incurred on the job and instead seek treatment privately, bearing the cost themselves or passing these costs on to their health insurance provider ‚Äì an element in the increasing cost of health insurance nationwide. Typically, workers can only receive compensation for injuries received while on the job, but in some states there are exceptions: traveling salespersons and similar employees can be covered if they are injured while taking a work-related trip, employees who are sent on special errands can receive compensation for injuries received on those errands. In some cases workers who, though not currently working, suffer injuries while on the premises of the employer can also receive compensation.See, e.g., In all states except Georgia and Mississippi, it is illegal for an employer to terminate or refuse to hire an employee for having reported a workplace injury or filed a workers' compensation claim. However, it is often not easy to prove discrimination on the basis of the employee's claims history. To abate discrimination of this type, some states have created a \\"subsequent injury trust fund\\" which will reimburse insurers for benefits paid to workers who suffer aggravation or recurrence of a compensable injury. It is also suggested that laws should be made to prohibit inclusion of claims history in databases or to make it anonymous. (See privacy laws.) = Employer liability = Although workers' compensation statutes generally make the employer completely immune from any liability (such as for negligence) above the amount provided by the workers' compensation statutory framework, there are exceptions. In some states, like New Jersey, an employer can still be held liable for larger amounts if the employee proves the employer intentionally caused the harm, while in other states, like Pennsylvania, the employer is immune in all circumstances, but other entities involved in causing the injury, like subcontractors or product manufacturers, may still be held liable. = Appeals = If a workers' compensation claim is denied, for example because an employer or employee fail to follow proper procedures when reporting the injury or if the insurance company does not believe the claim, the injured worker may appeal the denial. In most states, workers compensation claims are handled by administrative law judges, who often act as triers of fact. According to one 2018 study, 70% of initially-denied claims are ultimately paid. Some employers and insurance companies vigorously contest employee claims for workers' compensation payments. Injured workers may be able to get help with their claims from state agencies or by retaining a workers' compensation lawyer. Laws in many states limit a claimant's legal expenses to a certain fraction of an award; such \\"contingency fees\\" are payable only if the recovery is successful. In some states this fee can be as high as 40% or as little as 11% of the monetary award recovered, if any. In the vast majority of states, original jurisdiction over workers' compensation disputes has been transferred by statute from the trial courts to special administrative agencies.\\"Social Security Programs in the United States\\" by DIANE Publishing Company, p.34 books.google.com Within such agencies, disputes are usually handled informally by administrative law judges. Appeals may be taken to an appeals board and from there into the state court system. However, such appeals are difficult and are regarded skeptically by most state appellate courts, because the point of workers' compensation was to reduce litigation. A few states still allow the employee to initiate a lawsuit in a trial court against the employer. For example, Ohio allows appeals to go before a jury.See Ohio Rev. Code Section 4123.512. In California, the Article XIV section 4 of the California Constitution, sets forth the intent of the people to establish a system of workers' compensation. = Texas = Texas is unusual in that it allows employers to opt out of the workers' compensation system, with those employers who do not purchase workers' compensation insurance being called non-subscribers. However, those employers are exposed to legal liability in the event of employee injury. The employee must demonstrate that employer negligence caused the injury; if the employer does not subscribe to workers' compensation, the employer loses their common law defense of contributory negligence, assumption of the risk, and the fellow employee doctrine. If successful, the employee can recover their full common law damages, which are more generous than workers' compensation benefits. In 1995, 44% of Texas employers were non-subscribers, while in 2001 the percentage was estimated to be 35%. The industry advocacy group Texas Association of Business Nonsubscription claims that non-subscribing employers have had greater satisfaction ratings and reduced expenses when compared to employers enrolled in the workers' compensation system. A research survey by Texas's Research and Oversight Council on Workers' Compensation found that 68% of non-subscribing employers and 60% of subscribing employers‚Äîa majority in both cases‚Äîwere satisfied with their experiences in the system, and that satisfaction with non-subscription increased with the size of the firm; but it stated that further research was needed to gauge satisfaction among employees and to determine the adequacy of compensation under non-subscription compared to subscription. In recent years, the Texas Supreme Court has been limiting employer duties to maintain employee safety, limiting the remedies received by injured workers.  Privatization  In recent years, workers' compensation programs in West Virginia and Nevada were successfully privatised, through mutualisation, in part to resolve situations in which the programs in those states had significantly underfunded their liabilities. Only four states rely on entirely state-run programs for workers' compensation: North Dakota, Ohio, Washington, and Wyoming. These four states are referred to as monopolistic states as they require their employers to purchase workers compensation from a government-operated fund. Bonner, Marianne. ‚ÄúHow to Buy Workers Compensation Insurance in Monopolistic States.‚Äù The Balance Small Business, NELP, 20 Nov. 2019, https://www.thebalancesmb.com/workers-compensation-insurance-in- monopolistic-states-462813 Many other states maintain state-run funds but also allow private insurance companies to insure employers and their employees, as well.  Federal laws The federal government has its own workers' compensation program, subject to its own requirements and statutory parameters for federal employees. The federal government pays its workers' compensation obligations for its own employees through regular appropriations.  Alternate statutory compensation  Employees of common carriers by rail have a statutory remedy under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. sec. 51, which provides that a carrier \\"shall be liable\\" to an employee who is injured by the negligence of the employer. To enforce his compensation rights, the employee may file suit in United States district court or in a state court. The FELA remedy is based on tort principles of ordinary negligence and differs significantly from most state workers' compensation benefit schedules. Seafarers employed on United States vessels who are injured because of the owner's or the operator's negligence can sue their employers under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. App. 688., essentially a remedy very similar to the FELA one. Dock workers and other maritime workers, who are not seafarers working aboard navigating vessels, are covered by the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, known as US L&H.;  Workers' compensation fraud  Workers' compensation fraud can be committed by doctors, lawyers, employers, insurance company employees and claimants, and may occur in both the private and public sectors. The topic of workers' compensation fraud is highly controversial, with claimant supporters arguing that fraud by claimants is rare‚Äîas low as one-third of one percent, others focusing on the widely reported National Insurance Crime Bureau statistic that workers' compensation fraud accounts for $7.2 billion in unnecessary costs, and government entities acknowledging that \\"there is no generally accepted method or standard for measuring the extent of workers' compensation fraud ... as a consequence, there are widely divergent opinions about the size of the problem and the relative importance of the issue.\\" According to the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, tens of billions of dollars in false claims and unpaid premiums are stolen in the U.S. alone every year. The most common forms of workers' compensation fraud by workers are: # Remote injury. Workers get injured away from work, but say they were hurt on the job so that their workers' compensation policy will cover the medical bills. # Inflating injuries. A worker has a fairly minor job injury, but lies about the magnitude of the injury in order to collect more workers' compensation money and stay away from work longer. # Faking injuries. Workers fabricate an injury that never took place, and claim it for workers' compensation benefits. # Old injury. A worker with an old injury that never quite healed claims it as a recent work injury in order to get medical care covered. # Malingering. A worker stays home by pretending the disability is ongoing when it is actually healed. # Failure to Disclose. A worker knowingly, or unknowingly, makes a false statement or representation about their injury. The most common forms of workers' compensation fraud by employers are: # Underreporting payroll. An employer reports that workers are paid less than they actually are in order to lower their premiums. # Inflating experience. An employer claims workers are more experienced than they actually are in order to make them seem less risky and therefore less expensive to cover. # Evasion. An employer fails to obtain workers' compensation for their employees when it is required by law. Workers are often deceived into thinking they are covered when they are not. # Through the introduction of \\"opt-out plans\\" that are governed by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, which is regulated by the Labor Department. The \\"opt-out plans\\"provide lower and fewer payments, make it more difficult to qualify for benefits, control access to doctors and limit independent appeals of benefits decisions.

He published numerous books on homeopathic medicine. He was one of the founders of Hahnemann Hospital in New York City in 1869. His career also included land development in Brooklyn and Queens, New York; improving land in Potter County, Pennsylvania, for German immigrants; railroad development; and, political service as a New York city Alderman. He was involved with many companies and associations. Early life Radde was educated at the Werder Gymnasium in Berlin, where he learned Latin from Karl Gottlob Zumpt, Greek from Philipp Karl Buttmann, Sanskrit from Franz Bopp, mathematics from Christian Gottlieb Zimmermann,(in German) and theology and philology from August Ferdinand Ribbeck; he was afterwards an apprentice printer under Julius Starke, printer for Berlin University. In 1824, Radde began working on Sanskrit books for the printing house Dondey, Dupr√© & Son in Paris. He was in Paris during the revolution of 1830. In 1831 he moved to London and received support from Lord Brougham, one of the founders of the Edinburgh Review, to begin compiling and publishing. Joining Wesselhoeft in America While Radde seemed to have good opportunities in London, western Europe was in the midst of rebellions and gatherings against aristocratic rule in favor of constitutions and democracy. Radde might be considered a Dreissiger, as he immigrated to America during an 1830s surge in German American immigration. In the 1830s and 1840s, Radde helped print and distribute the German language newspaper ' (Old and New World) with Johann Georg Wesselhoeft to assist German immigrants. In 1833 Radde left London to join Johann Georg Wesselhoeft (1804-1859) in Philadelphia, soon to expand Wesselhoeft's information service for immigrants in New York city and distribute the German language newspaper ' (Old and New World), first published in 1834. Wesselhoeft was trained as a printer by his uncles Johann Carl Wesselhoeft and Friedrich Frommann in Jena; he immigrated to America in 1832 with his brother Carl Friedrich Wesselhoeft; he visited his cousin William Wesselhoeft in Bath, Pa., where William had established a Homeopathic School of Medicine;Illustration: in 1833 J.

In 1837, Radde was \\"importer of German, French, and Spanish books, wholesale and retail, 471 Pearl.\\" By 1839, Radde had established his business at 322 Broadway, opposite New York Hospital. In 1835 Johann Georg Wesselhoeft sold The Homoeopathist, or Domestic Physician, by Constantine Hering, through his three bookstores in Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York city. Radde earned a living assisting immigrants, selling Wesselhoeft's newspaper, and importing books. More risky were his efforts to develop a publishing business; his earliest efforts were not successful. He wrote: > Encouraged by good friends, I had Goethe's Faust printed at the Staats- > Zeitung printing office and with it began the publication of a selection > from the best German classics.

The New-Yorker Staats Zeitung printed a complaint against Radde's \\"aristocratic insolence,\\" noting that their agents would return unopened any future unpaid shipments.

By 1841, Radde had adjusted his business to market demands. ' (Museum of German Classics) became a bound book printed by Heinrich Ludwig, published by Radde, and widely distributed. Two of Radde's other early publications for the German American market also exist: ' (The Bell) by Friedrich Schiller, and ' (The robbers: adventures of two friends at a castle in Bohemia) by E. T. A. Hoffmann. None of Wesselhoeft's other agents would attempt to make a living selling only books and newspapers; in America, most books and newspapers were sold as any other commodity in general stores offering hardware, toys, stationary, groceries, notions, and feed. In Germany and France, Radde had worked on academic books for wealthy customers and universities. In America he learned to sell inexpensive popular books through colporteurs, through local stores, and directly to primary and secondary schools (textbooks), though his English language advertising emphasized imported books and his own publications. Wesselhoeft was heavily influenced by Heinrich Zschokke to print cheap American progressive textbooks for German-American schools; in 1839 he published a German textbook for primary students, modified for American students. Cazden, p. 275 In 1837 Heinrich Ludwig in New York city published a German primer; he would later publish other inexpensive school books. Radde and Ludwig worked together as publisher and printer over the years, but few of their cheap pamphlets have survived. In English language newspapers and periodicals, Radde advertised his more expensive books. The printer Heinrich Ludwig (Henry Ludwig) (?-1872) was a Palatine German American from Columbia County, New York. He started a retail book business in New York city selling German schoolbooks and hymnals printed in Philadelphia; in 1834, he established his own printing house and published the newspaper ' (General Newspaper) (1835-1840?); in the 1840s he printed and imported German books; from 1852 to 1872 he published and edited ' (The Lutheran Herald) for the New York State Lutheran Ministerium. Ludwig and Radde, both German Lutheran printers of similar age, collaborated for many years. Radde was an energetic entrepreneur and philanthropist who did not set up his own printing press in America but rather used skilled local printers. Henry Ludwig printed The North American Journal of Homeopathy from 1856 to 1870, initially as \\"Book & Job Printer, 45 Vesey-st.,\\" later as \\"Book and Job Printer and Stereotyper, Nos. 39 and 41 Centre Street.\\" A hymnal printed by Ludwig in 1834 was stereotyped by Henry W. Rees. By 1854, a Ludwig publication was \\"to be had of all the principal Booksellers throughout the United States\\" =Homeopathic Books and Medicines= Hahnemann Hospital in New York City, 1884 \\"Homeopathic books and materia medica were the most profitable specialties pioneered and cultivated by Wesselh√∂ft and his associates.... For most of the nineteenth century German-American firms dominated this market.\\" Radde dominated the market for homoeopathic drugs in the United States from 1840, when he purchased Wesselhoeft's drug inventory and also became the United States agent for the Central Homoeopathic Pharmacy of Leipzig, to 1869, when he sold his homoeopathic interests to Boericke and Tafel of Philadelphia. In the 1830s there was some evidence that homeopathic treatments had a lower mortality rate than mainstream medical practices of the time. Pp. 19-21. Bloodletting and \\"purging\\" (induced vomiting) were mainstream medical practices for such illnesses as cholera and yellow fever. There were no antibiotics or vaccines in Radde's lifetime. \\"Allopathic medicine\\" was used to refer to mainstream medical practices of the time, and there was heated debate between allopaths and homeopaths. Radde supported homeopathy, particularly homeopathic research‚Äîas did the Wesselhoeft family and William Cullen Bryant, President of the New York Homeopathic Society in 1842.

Companies and Associations=German Society of the City of New York= Radde was a member of the German Society of the City of New York from 1839 until at least 1883, during a period when the German Society and other immigrant Societies were trying to assist an influx of immigrants from many nations. From 1826 to 1832, the Society was essentially without funds and moribund. In 1833, they published the first printed guide for immigrants. In 1834, the Society noted \\"it is recommended to establish a German Library and a Scientific Society in connection with the German Society, in order to attract new members to the latter,\\" and \\"resolved to establish an agency for the benefit of German emigrants.\\" In 1837, they added two physicians to their Board of Directors. In 1838, John Jacob Astor, president of the Society from 1837 to 1841, donated $5,000 to the Society. Over the following years, the Society was very active in assisting immigrants arriving in New York ports. Radde did not become an admitted member of the Society until 1839. His acceptance was expeditious: in contrast, in 1838, \\"Mr. Charles M. Burkhalter, who has belonged to the Society for 45 years, and is its oldest member, was admitted to membership.\\" In 1841, Georg Heinrich Paulsen ‚Äî Radde's partner in publishing the 1837 edition of Goethe's Faust, and also Radde's associate at Wesselhoeft's New York information agency ‚Äî was appointed as the Society's first paid agent for assisting immigrants. He served in that position until 1845. =Government= In 1871, Radde served on the Committee of Seventy to oppose fraud by New York City public officials, and he later served as a member of the board of Aldermen. Notable Associates William Radde sent a telegram to Abraham Lincoln on Friday, January 16, 1863. In 1878, William Cullen Bryant wrote a letter of introduction for Radde to Rutherford B. Hayes. Family The names of Radde's parents and siblings are unknown, as is the name of the guardian who raised him. He married Christina Hoffmann (abt 1818-1880) in New York city in 1835; they celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary in 1860.North American Journal of Homoeopathy, Volume 9, p. 352. They had six children: William, Jr. (1836-1862), Emilia/Emily (abt 1841-1896), Francisca/Fanny (abt 1843-1921), Charles H. S. (abt 1845-1866), Louis E. G.(abt 1850-1893), and Philippina (abt 1852-1906). Emily married Theodore Gaston Glaubensklee in New York City in 1862. Louis married Marie Kaufmann in New York city in 1884. Philippina married Alfred L. Golsh in New York city in 1869. Radde's grandchildren were Philippina Golsh (abt 1875-1924) and Alfred L. Golsh (1870-1953).

It opened in 1966 and held over 3,400 days of harness racing until it was sold to Churchill Downs Inc. in 1991. Louisville Downs was built and managed by William H. King, a Louisville entrepreneur and promoter, who was the first to offer wagering by phone (‚ÄúCall-a-Bet‚Äù) and full card simulcast wagering to television viewers. https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/03/Call-A-Bet-the-lazy-mans-way-to-play- the-horses/9531352443600/ The track is now the site of Derby City Gaming, a historical racing parlor opened in 2018.  History  King was a well-known promoter of entertainment events in Louisville. Prior to launching Louisville Downs, he had gained local renown for presenting sport, boat and vacation shows and events at the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. One of his most significant promotions was of 18-year-old Cassius Clay‚Äôs first professional fight on October 29, 1960 versus Tunney Hunsaker at Fairgrounds Coliseum. In 1965, King and a group of investors which included Raymond Kolowich, R. Victor Mosley and Fred Somes, formed Louisville Downs, Inc. to purchase an 80-acre plot at 4520 Poplar Level Road on the southwestern edge of Louisville, Kentucky. King led the development of Louisville Downs, designed by architect John H. Menges of Thayer-Menges and Associates of New Castle, Pennsylvania and constructed by Maintream Corporation based in Pittsburgh, PA. Construction was begun in September of 1965 and completed in June, 1966. Officers and directors of Louisville Downs, Inc. at the time of its launch included King (President and General Manager), Kolowich (Chairman of the Board), Peter Miller, Fred Somes, Jr. Jack Drees, John H. Menges and Chris Duvall.  Facilities and track  Called ‚Äúone of the most innovative and progressive Standardbred racing venues in the country,\\" Louisville Downs seated 4,621 total, with a 2,954-seat glass-enclosed grandstand topped with an iconic peppermint-striped roof. Seating also included a 300-seat clubhouse, 400-seat dining terrace, 860 railbird box seats and 107 royal box seats. The stables included eight 60-stall barns and three paddock buildings with 40 stalls. The 1/2 mile track had a limestone base topped with 4‚Äù of limestone dust, new to harness racing at the time. Louisville Downs held its first race on July 14, 1966, opening a 51-night meeting that ran through September 10, 1966. Opening night drew 3,490 fans betting $102,098 on ten races. Charming Lad won the first race, paying $14, and Honor Time was the length winner, paying $3.60. Ten years later, Louisville Downs began its most successful period, with an average daily attendance of over 3,000 fans and over $220,000 in wagers. King, whom the Courier-Journal once called the ‚Äútrack‚Äôs longtime marketing mastermind,‚Äù continued to hone his promotional expertise for Louisville Downs through various crowd-drawing promotions, including Quarter Night (Parking, admission, hot dogs, beer and soft drinks all 25c), giveaways and cash drawings. In March, 1981, King created a dial-in betting system called Call-A-Bet, the first advance-deposit wagering system in the country, and in 1988 instituted full-card simulcast racing. In 1978, Louisville Downs hosted its first run of the Kentucky Pacing Derby, part of the Triple Crown for 2-year-old pacers. The race was held each September and attracted the best 2-year-old pacers in the world, including Niatross, the first pacer to break the 1:50 time barrier.  Other events  King brought non-harness racing spectators to Louisville Downs by hosting additional sport and music events. American Motorcycle Association held its Half-Mile Grand National Championship races there from 1967 until 1991. One of Louisville's first Fourth of July fireworks shows set to music was held at Louisville Downs in 1976, with a water skiing show held on the large infield lake. Some of the musical talents who appeared at Louisville Downs were: * The Guess Who, May 1974 * Beach Boys, May 1974 * Sha Na Na, July 1974 * Three Dog Night, July 1975 * Earl Scruggs and Emmylou Harris, July 1976  Sale to Churchill Downs  Harness racing ended at Louisville Downs in 1991, when Churchill Downs Inc. purchased the 87-acre site for $6 million, using the grandstand for simulcast racing and racetrack for training thoroughbreds. The grandstand was razed in 2015. In September 2018, Churchill Downs opened Derby City Gaming, a historical racing facility, at the site. Harness racing may return to the former Louisville Downs site; in September 2018, Churchill Downs and Keeneland Association filed an application with the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission to hold 10 days of harness meets in 2019.

The road runs from the Tunduma border with Tanzania via Mpika, Kabwe and Lusaka to the Chirundu border with Zimbabwe. The road is the longest route of the country, as it is approximately 1155 kilometers. https://citymeter.net/distance-between-Nakonde-and-Chirundu-via- Lusaka-535117992&ved;=2ahUKEwjp9ZeYnILfAhUMLcAKHR4DD5oQFjACegQICBAB&usg;=AOvVaw363FbczGO4mADvLKWxiRXH For its entire route, the T2 is known as Zambia's Great North Road and is part of the Cape to Cairo Road. Also, the section from Tanzania to Lusaka is known as the Tanzam Highway. Route The entire route forms Zambia's Great North Road and is part of the famed Cape to Cairo Road. =Muchinga Province= The T2 Road begins from Zambia's Border Post with Tanzania near Tunduma as the Tanzam Highway. It goes south-west through the town of Nakonde. From Nakonde, the T2 goes southwards for 86 km to the town of Isoka. After Isoka, the road goes south-west for 263 km, bypassing Chinsali (Muchinga Province's Capital), through Shiwang'andu District, to the town of Mpika, where it is joined by the M1 Road from Kasama and Mbala. The Name Great North Road used to apply to the M1 road up to the Mbala Border with Tanzania, but the name has since been given to the T2 Road to Nakonde, due to its direct route to important Towns in Tanzania. =Central Province= From Mpika, the T2 Road makes a 245 km Journey south-south-west, through Lavushimanda District, crossing into Central Province and passing through Chitambo District, to Serenje. Just before Serenje Town, at a place named Pensulo, the T2 meets a direct road to Luapula Province, named the Serenje-Samfya Road (opened in 1983), which is used by motorists to access Luapula Province quickly. From Serenje, the T2 makes a 200 km journey west-south-west, bypassing the farming town of Mkushi, to Kapiri Mposhi. From the Tanzania Border Post, the T2 is accompanied to Kapiri Mposhi by a railway named the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA Railway). At Kapiri Mposhi, the T2 Road meets the T3 Road from Ndola and Kitwe in the Copperbelt Province and the Kasumbalesa border with DR Congo. They meet at a T-junction. As the T3 Route ends at this junction, the T2 Route becomes the road southwards towards Kapiri Mposhi Central. From Kapiri Mposhi, the road goes for 60 km south-south-west to Kabwe, which is Central Province's Capital and home to the Mulungushi Rock of Authority. From Kabwe, the road goes 55 km south-west to the town of Chibombo. After Chibombo, at the Junction with the M20 Road to Mumbwa (a junction famously known as Landless Corner), the T2 road turns south-east and quickly enters Chisamba District (bypassing Chisamba Farm to the west), before turning directly south towards Lusaka and re-entering Chibombo District again (passing through the Katuba Constituency). =Lusaka Province= Next, the T2 leaves Chibombo District, Central Province and enters Lusaka, Zambia's Capital City, in the Province of the same name. It enters just before the National Heroes Stadium. At the roundabout at the northern end of the City Centre, the T2 Route meets the T4 Route (Great East Road) from Chongwe and Chipata (and the Republic of Malawi) and the M9 Road (Great West Road) from Mumbwa and Mongu. This junction of the Great Roads of Zambia marks the end of the T2 being known as the Tanzam Highway. Right after this roundabout, the T2 becomes Cairo Road, an avenue with many trees and businesses on the road and where heavy vehicles are not permitted to pass. (Trucks are advised to use Lumumba Road to bypass the City Centre to the west and come back on the T2 south of the City Centre) At the southern end of the City Centre, the T2 has a roundabout again, where it meets Lusaka's Independence Avenue and becomes Kafue Road. At the next junction, the southern end of Lumumba Road is met. This is where heavy vehicles going northwards are advised to join Lumumba Road to skip the town centre and bypass it to the west. (This is also where heavy vehicles going southwards rejoin the main road) Going south of Lusaka, the road is named Kafue Road. It goes for 45 km, through the town of Chilanga, to the town of Kafue. Just after crossing the Kafue River 15 kilometres from the Kafue Town Centre, the T2 temporarily enters Chikankata District in Southern Province, where it meets the north- eastern terminus of the T1 Road from Mazabuka, Choma, Livingstone and the Victoria Falls (with links to Botswana, Namibia and north-western Zimbabwe) (this road is famously known as the Lusaka-Livingstone Road). From the Livingstone Road junction, the T2 goes east-south-east, following the Kafue River, to come back into Lusaka Province and continue to Chirundu on the border with Zimbabwe (Zambezi River), where there is a bridge (built in 1939) to connect with the A1 Road (R3 Road) on the Zimbabwean side going to Harare. 17 kilometres before Chirundu, the T2 meets the M15 Road, which is the road that provides access to the tourist town of Siavonga on the Zambezi River near Kariba Dam and a border connecting to the town of Kariba on the Zimbabwean side. As the Cape to Cairo Road, The T2 becomes the Chirundu-Beitbridge Regional Road Corridor in Zimbabwe, which connects to South Africa. Trans- African Highway Network The T2 between the Tanzania border and the T1 Road junction south of Kafue is part of the Trans-African Highway 4 (Cairo-Cape Town Highway), which connects Cairo in Egypt with Cape Town in South Africa. (the Cairo-Cape Town Highway continues from here as the T1 Road) The T2 between Kapiri Mposhi and the Zimbabwe border is part of the Trans-African Highway 9 (Beira-Lobito Highway), which connects Beira in Mozambique with Lobito in Angola. (The Beira-Lobito Highway continues from Kapiri Mposhi as the T3 Road)https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2_(Zambia) Great North Road In the past, the M1 Road from Mpika northwards to Mbala and Mpulungu was known as Zambia's Great North Road. Then, the name Great North Road was given to the T2 Road from Mpika north-east to the Tanzania Border just after Nakonde, probably due to the fact that it is part of the Cape to Cairo Road. So, the M1 Road is now known as the Old Great North Road. Before 1939, the T1 Road from its junction with the T2 Road near Kafue south-west to Livingstone and the Victoria Falls was known as the Great North Road. Then, in 1939, when the Chirundu Bridge over the Zambezi River was opened to connect the T2 Road with the A1 Road in Zimbabwe to Harare, the T2 from its junction with the T1 eastwards to Chirundu became known as the Great North Road, probably because the route to Harare was officially declared part of the Cape to Cairo Road rather than the route to Livingstone. Therefore, the T2 Road now forms the entire section of Zambia's Great North Road. M15 Road (Zambia) The M15 Road is the 65-kilometre road connecting the tourist town of Siavonga in Southern Province with Chirundu in Lusaka Province. Together with the T2 Road, it is the main route connecting Siavonga with the rest of the country. It begins 15 kilometres west of Chirundu in Lusaka Province at a junction with the T2 Road and goes southwards for 65 kilometres to Siavonga in Southern Province. It bypasses Siavonga town centre to the east and becomes the eastern wall of the Kariba Dam, where it crosses the Zambezi River borderline into the republic of Zimbabwe, with the town of Kariba on the Zimbabwean side.

Kulap was a 19th-century Siamese writer, historian, and essayist. Born in early 19th-century Siam, his essays regarding the history of Thailand resulted in him producing a significant body of works across his career. Some of his works were censored by the Thai monarchy, and Kulap himself was often noted as being an unreliable historian.  Biography  Kulap was born in 1834. His mother and grandmother traced their lineage back to a minor Thai noble, and as such Kulap was able to enter the civil service at the age of 11. He studied at Wat Phra Chettuphon monastery, and in his early teens studied Buddhism and Chindamani texts. In his late teens he changed his name to Kesaro (translatable to \\"Rose\\" in English), which helped to formulate his pen name, K.S.R. Kulap. After finishing his monastical studies, he was inducted into the Royal Pages Bodyguard Regiment, where he was taught (described by himself as a \\"smattering\\") some French, British, and Latin by a French adviser to King Mongkut. Kulap married at the age of 25, and a year later was ordained as a monk. In the 1860s, Kulap left the monkhood and entered the employment of several British, American, and German firms that were operating in Thailand. As a result of this new career, Kulap saw a drastic increase in his personal wealth, and working with foreign companies allowed him to travel to various European-administered cities in Asia. There, he became fascinated with western methods of printing, which he resolved to implement in Thailand. Kulap accomplished this, and produced a number of books concerning the history of the-then Kingdom of Siam. During the 1880s, Kulap gradually ingratiated himself with the royal court of Thailand; He was aided in this ingratiation due to the fact that he had studied under one of the same teachers that King Mongkut had. Kulap quickly gained a reputation as a lover of history who was able to translate many older manuscripts from previous eras of Thai history, and this skill set grew his prestige in the royal court. Some of his methods‚Äîparticularly his tendency to translate texts based on memory‚Äîresulted in him being criticized by some of his fellow scholars; in one notable instance, Kulpa was accused of altering sources when a source (an account of the traditions of Ayutthayan nobles captured during the Burmese-Ayutthayan wars) was not discovered in the royal archives. Kulap countered that he had accurately relayed the source's information; this source was later found in the 1910s, proving the veracity of Kulap's translation. However, Kulap's eccentric writing style, generalization of facts, and pro-western views were sometimes mocked by his contemporaries. He was found guilty of falsifying texts in 1902, but was pardoned due to the negligence of a government official and due to his age. In 1897, Kulap founded his own journal, Sayam Praphet, which produced texts and moral pamphlets inspired by historical works from Siam's past. He died in 1921.

Police responded to a shooting at the mall where two people were shot. Another African-American man suspected in the first shooting was arrested in Georgia a week later and charged in the shooting of one of those injured. Bradford was holding a legally owned weapon when shot and was not involved in the prior shooting incident, although near the crime scene. The shooting of Bradford was immediately controversial, and was condemned by the Alabama National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as an example of racially biased policing. Background Emantic \\"EJ\\" Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., of Hueytown, Alabama, was 21 years old. He was born on June 18, 1997. He attended Holy Family Cristo Rey High School in Birmingham and earned his diploma through the General Educational Development (GED) program. Bradford had enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2017 and completed basic training, but was administratively separated in August 2018 before completing advanced individual training. Bradford worked full-time and was a caretaker for his father, a former correctional officer, with cancer. Incident On November 22, 2018, at approximately 9:52 PM local time, an altercation involving four people occurred near the Footaction and JCPenney stores on the second level of the mall. One of the men ‚Äì initially claimed to be Bradford and currently believed to be Erron Brown, who was later arrested by U.S. Marshalls ‚Äì reportedly drew a weapon and shot 18-year-old Brian Wilson twice, before fleeing the area. Stray gunfire also hit a 12-year-old girl bystander. Within five seconds from Wilson the shots, two officers from the Hoover Police Department approached Bradford, who was armed. One of the officers immediately fired from behind at Bradford, who was running with gun in hand, and killed him. It subsequently transpired that Bradford's movements in the critical seconds were more complicated than originally thought.https://www.alabamaag.gov/Documents/news/Hoover/Report.pdf Brian Wilson and the injured 12-year-old were taken to different hospitals; Wilson in serious condition with two gunshots to the torso and the 12-year-old in stable condition with a lodged bullet near her spine. The mall was closed for the night. The 12-year-old was found to have had a rib fractured in the initial shooting, but her spine was undamaged. A 70-year-old woman had been injured by a fall while attempting to flee. She sustained multiple pelvic fractures, as well as internal bleeding and bleeding of the brain, and she was airlifted to Mobile. Investigation The Hoover Police Department turned all video and other collected evidence to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, which subsequently turned the investigation over to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. All three agencies initially refused to release videos of the event. During the investigation into the shooting, an additional gun was found in the \\"Santa's Village\\" portion of the Galleria. Doubt grew that Bradford was the initial shooter. In a press conference, Captain Rector of the Hoover Police Department stated that the initial shooter would need to be determined by the investigation into that shooting. Captain Rector also stated that they believe the initial altercation may have more people involved than originally suspected, and clarified that a separate investigation by the Hoover Police Department would occur for the police shooting. Late in the evening, the Hoover Police Department issued a correction saying that Bradford was not the shooter. They said the shooter was not in custody. Furthermore, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency took over as lead investigator of the shootings. A suspect in the initial shooting, Erron Martez Dequan Brown, was arrested by U.S. Marshals at a relative's home in Fairburn, Georgia, on November 29. He was charged with the attempted murder of Wilson. On February 5, 2019, the Office of the Attorney General of Alabama released a report of its review of the evidence regarding the police shooting. They determined that \\"Officer 1\\", as he was referred to in the report, \\"identified E.J. Bradford as an immediate deadly threat to innocent civilians and thus shot Bradford to eliminate the threat,\\" and therefore, that he, \\"did not commit a crime under Alabama law when he shot and killed E.J. Bradford and thus the Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct preclude presentation of this case to a grand jury.\\" The report was strongly criticised by Bradford's family. Aftermath The mall reopened the day after the shooting at 6 AM, and the two officers who were involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave pending the investigation. When it was reported that the 21-year-old deceased victim was not the perpetrator, the family of the victim raised demands that the Hoover, Alabama Mayor and Police Chief step down. Protests were organized by a Birmingham activist group called Justice League on the following Saturday. Protesters also called for a boycott of the Galleria. On November 26, 2018, a protest gathered outside Hoover City Hall, calling for the Hoover Police Department to release video from the police body cameras and mall surveillance cameras for public review. The protestors then shut down U.S. Highway 31, carrying signs reading \\"Black Lives Matter\\", \\"Justice for EJ\\", and \\"Justice starts with the truth\\", as they marched to the Riverchase Galleria, the site of the shooting. Additional protests throughout the city of Hoover were organized in the following weeks in areas including but not limited to multiple shopping areas, public interstates, and private residences of Hoover City Officials occurred in the following weeks, some resulting in the arrest of participants. =Family of Bradford= The family of Bradford hired civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Additionally, the Alabama chapter of the NAACP issued a press release condemning the \\"extreme and excessive police force.\\" At a press conference in Birmingham, Benjamin Crump claimed that witnesses to both shootings described the responding officers as not revealing that they were undercover officers nor that they gave any orders to people nearby before shooting Bradford. He also stated that Bradford was trying to clear the area when the officers reached the scene of the initial shooting and that they prevented Bradford from receiving aid for a gunshot wound to the face. It was claimed that the gun on Bradford was not in his hands, but attached to his pants. According to various members of Bradford's family, no one from the Hoover Police Department informed them of his death. In addition, they were not provided with any details of the police shooting until the November 28 meeting. One of Bradford's relatives called for the resignation of both Chief Derzis and Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato for their actions shortly after Bradford's death. A meeting between the family of Bradford and Mayor Brocato, Chief Derzis, and Councilman Derrick Murphy occurred on November 28. The city leaders apologized to the Bradford family for the shooting and answered what questions they could regarding the events. A vigil for Bradford was held on November 29 at the Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham. A funeral for Bradford was set for December 1 at the Boutwell Memorial Auditorium with Reverend Jesse Jackson to speak. A \\"preliminary anatomical review\\" was planned on November 29 for the following day to determine the number of shots that hit Bradford and whether Bradford was hit from the front or from behind. At a press conference on December 3, Crump was joined by attorneys Rodney Barganier and Frankie Lee in revealing the results of the independent autopsy. The review concluded that Bradford was shot three times from behind while he was running. The locations of the shots were to the right side of the head, the base of the neck, and the right portion of the hip. The bullets all entered from an upward angle and the shot to the head was the fatal shot, entering from the back right of the head and exiting above the left eye. = Hoover city = The Hoover City Council gave the ALEA until noon on 3 December to make a decision regarding the release of information pertaining to Bradford's shooting. Had the deadline passed without comment, Chief Derzis would have decided for the council if the information would have been released without the ALEA. Derzis revealed on the 3rd that the ALEA had asked city leaders to not reveal critical information while the investigation was in progress. On 6 December it was revealed that the ALEA had had a meeting with Bradford's family, attorneys for the family, and district attorneys Danny Carr and Lyniece Washington. Part of the meeting allowed those present to view a portion of the footage of Bradford being shot. The meeting was allowed provided that specific evidence not be publicly shared or detailed. A Justice for E.J. Community Forum was held with members from the Nation of Islam and Black Lives Matter, among others, at the Muhammad Mosque in Birmingham. The city additionally postponed a Christmas tree lighting ceremony that was to take place on 29 November due to threats that the lighting would be protested. A fourth protest occurred at the AMC Patton Creek movie theater on 2 December.

He was possibly the first mixed-race Member of Parliament (MP) of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Family Stewart was an illegitimate son of former Camelford Tory MP John Stewart (1754/5‚Äì1826) and Mary Duncan. Upon his father's death, he took ownership of plantations in Grenada and Demerara, as well as the family home in Albany, London. However, by 1830, he was living in Wellington Street, Westminster, with his wife, Elizabeth n√©e Vincent, and son William Duncan Stewart (born April 1829). On 14 December 1848, Stewart remarried to Phoebe Rossiter, daughter of Joseph Rossiter. Business career After the abolition of slavery in 1833, Stewart was compensated ¬£22,486 for the Demerara plantation in British Guiana, where 433 were enslaved. He retained possession of this estate, as well as Stewartville, also in British Guiana, and purchased a further estate in the region in 1839, importing some labour from Madeira to Annandale. Also, a trustee of the Hope Vale estate in Grenada, in 1836 he claimed to have owned the \\"largest slave state\\" in Antigua between 1824 and 1826. By the 1850s, he was well-established in the City of London, investing at least ¬£16,000 in the British railways. He became a director of the British West India Company in 1846, a member of the provisional committee of the Demerara Railway Company in the same year, a director of the London and Westminster Joint Stock Bank; and deputy chairman of the Universal Life Assurance Society. Member of Parliament Stewart became parliament's first mixed-race MP when he was elected Tory MP for Lymington at the 1832 general election. During this election, he defended his record as a slave owner and rebuffed arguments that slaves on his Demerara estates were subject to cruelty. After his election, he presented a petition to the Commons against the abolition of slavery, and often spoke in defence of West Indian plantation owners, sharing concerns over apprenticeships and sugar duties with other MPs with West Indian interests. Becoming a Conservative MP in 1834, Stewart then went on to oppose Sir George Strickland, 7th Baronet's motion that apprenticeships should be abolished on 1 August 1838, and in 1833 and the 1840s, he opposed the reduction of sugar duties, although this latter position was \\"a little inconsistent\\". While a supporter of free trade, the abolition of the Corn Laws, and Robert Peel's government, he voted against the government on some occasions. However, these positions ultimately led to his downfall at the 1847 general election, when he was defeated. While his career was \\"undistinguished\\", \\"the bigoted anti-colour party in the West Indies could never get over his election by an English borough, but he was extremely popular with his constituents\\".

For the April 1945 invasion of Okinawa, the Allies assembled the most powerful naval force in history. Since the few remaining capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Combined Fleet had been sunk or otherwise put out of action at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Allies were effectively unopposed in terms of surface vessels; a single mission consisting of the superbattleship and a few escorts was undertaken, but the task force did not get within of the invasion area. Since the Japanese air arm had been equally decimated by this point in the war, the lack of trained and experienced pilots led them to deploy the kamikaze extensively in the waters off Okinawa.

Summary Article II, Section 26 of the Constitution of Colorado states: > \\"There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude, > except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly > convicted.\\" An organization to remove the language, Abolish Slavery Colorado, collected signatures to put the question on the ballot in 2016 as Colorado Amendment T, but it failed by less than 1%. Advocates of the initiative blamed the wording of the question, which stated: > \\"Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado constitution concerning the > removal of the exception to the prohibition of slavery and involuntary > servitude when used as punishment for persons duly convicted of a crime?\\" In 2018, the question was changed for clarity and put before voters, requiring a 55% affirmative vote to pass. The question was: > \\"Shall there be an amendment to the Colorado constitution that prohibits > slavery and involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime and thereby > prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude in all circumstances?\\" The 2018 question was passed by 66.23% of voters on November 6. As a result, Article II, Section 26 of the Colorado Constitution now simply reads: > \\"There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary > servitude.\\" Impact A lawsuit was filed in July 2020 by three inmates and one former inmates against Gov. Jared Polis, the Colorado Department of Corrections and a private prison operator under Amendment A to increase wages for penal labor from USD$0.10 an hour, which the inmates described as \\"slave wages\\", to the current Colorado minimum wage (USD$12 an hour as of 2020), in addition to paid sick leave and vacation time.

(born √âtienne de La Rigaudelle du Buisson; 21 October 1786 ‚Äì 14 August 1864) was a French Catholic priest and member of the Society of Jesus.  Early life  √âtienne de La Rigaudelle du Buisson was born on 21 October 1786 in the town of Saint-Marc in the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue, where the La Rigaudelle du Buisson family owned two plantations that produced cotton and indigo dye. His mother was Marie-Elizabeth-Louise Poirer, who was born in Fort Dauphin. His father, Anne- Joseph-Sylvestre de La Rigaudelle du Buisson, was born in Saint-Marc in 1748, at the family's home in the center of Saint-Marc. His family was wealthy and enjoyed the high social status of the grand-blancs; it also had connections to the French minor nobility. Du Duisson was the second son of his parents and was reared by one of the family's house slaves, who acted as his wet nurse. √âtienne was named after his godfather, Fran√ßois-√âtienne Th√©ard, the French lieutenant governor of Saint-Marc. His mother died in December 1791, and his father married Ad√©la√Øde-Marie Favereau of Saint-Nicolas in May of that year. Their marriage produced several daughters. = Escape to France = In light of the impending Haitian Revolution, du Buisson's father sent him (at the age of five) and his brothers, No√´l-Marie and Joseph, to Nantes, France, sometime between March and May 1791. It would be many years before du Buisson would see his father again, who remained in Saint Domingue; he would never see his mother again. Though they were escaping impending violence ini Saint-Domingue, the brothers soon encountered a very different kind in France. Arriving in the midst of the French Revolution, the boys survived the Reign of Terror, and the massacres of the War in the Vend√©e, including the occupation of Nantes by the Catholic and Royal Armies in 1792. Du Buisson never received a formal education in his youth, a fact that he lamented later in life. Nonetheless, he likely studied in secret under the tutelage of a non-juror priest who had not sworn allegiance to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. In addition, du Buisson studied literature and poetry on his own, and came to be fluent in English by the age of 15. He would eventually come to speak seven languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Latin, and Ancient Greek, and have a working knowledge of Hebrew.  French civil service  In 1804 or 1805, du Buisson sat for and passed the agr√©gation (the French civil service exam) at the Congr√©gation de la Sainte-Vierge in Nantes. One of his assignments was in the receiver general's office of the French Army, where he was stationed in Germany during the Napoleonic Wars and worked in the Army of the Rhine from May 1809 to March 1810. He was then assigned to occupied Vienna from 1811 to 1814, first as assistant cashier of the special crown land and then as assistant cashier of the crown treasury. Du Buisson then returned to France, where he resided in an apartment in the royal Tuileries Palace in Paris, serving as the cashier-comptroller of the crown from December 1814 to June 1815. During this time, he befriended Baron Fran√ßois Roullet de La Bouillerie, a member of the Conseil d'√âtat and the intendant of the treasury of the civil list. Du Buisson retained his employment in the civil service through the abdication of Napoleon and the restoration of Louis XVIII as King of France, which allowed him to support his family members. During this time, he would pay visits to the sick in Parisian hospitals alongside young nobles, including Viscount Mathieu de Montmorency and Count Alexis de Noailles. He also undertook independent study and learned to play the violin.  Missionary to the United States  When du Buisson first expressed his desire to enter religious life at the age of 29, his family was staunchly opposed. Nonetheless, he decided to enter the Society of Jesus, whose suppression by the pope had been recently lifted. Unbeknownst to his family, Dubisson set sail for the United States with the Sulpician priest Simon Brut√©, whose order was active in North America. He arrived in New York City on 21 November 1815 and then traveled south to Georgetown College in Washington, D.C., arriving on 1 December. From there, he proceeded to the Jesuit novitiate in White Marsh, Maryland, on 15 December 1815. At this time, he also began anglicizing his name as Stephen Larigaudelle Dubuisson. = Georgetown College = Before long, Dubuisson returned to Georgetown for his religious studies. Dubuisson found himself in the midst of tensions between the Anglo-American Jesuits, who adopted republicanism and American culture, and their Continental European counterparts who were more traditional and austere. For this reason, he was disliked by his Anglo-American peers, despite being considered refined; likewise, Dubuisson regarded them as irreverant. In 1816, he was appointed prefect by the president of the college, Giovanni Grassi; his appointment was renewed again for the 1817‚Äì1818 academic year under Grassi's successor, Anthony Kohlmann. In this role, Kohlmann charged him with enforcing stricter discipline among the students. The students were so incensed by this that in 1818 they plotted to ambush Dubuisson and kill him with penknives and stones. Kohlmann discovered the plot moments before it was to be carried out, causing a revolt during supper. Between six and eight students were expelled as a result. While prefect, Dubisson continued his study of Latin, English, logic, and metaphysics. He professed his first vows on 26 December 1817, and was made the director of the Jesuit scholastics. That year, he began his four-year course of theology at the Washington Seminary (later known as Gonzaga College High School), and on 7 August 1821, was ordained a priest at Georgetown College by the Archbishop of Baltimore, Ambrose Mar√©chal. Following his ordination, Dubuisson began his pastoral work, first at St. Patrick's Church, under the direction of William Matthews. During this time, he was involved in what some considered to be the miraculous cure of Ann Mattingly, an ill Washingtonian. He also developed a reputation as an eloquent preacher among Washington's high society.  Presidency  On 9 September 1825, Dubuisson was appointed to succeed Benedict Joseph Fenwick as the president of Georgetown College, despite the fact that he not only considered himself unsuited for administration but desired to leave Georgetown altogether. Concurrent with his presidency, Dubuisson served as the pastor of Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown. His reputation as a severe disciplinarian resulted in declining student enrollment, and he soon requested that the Jesuit Superior General, Luigi Fortis, relieve him of the office. During his short tenure, he experienced what one historian described as a nervous breakdown. While in the infirmary, Dubuisson reported hearing a voice that told him to draw strength from the Sacred Heart. After just seven months, in April 1826, Fortis allowed Dubuisson to resign as president, and named William Feiner as his successor.  European interlude  Recognizing that Dubuisson was experiencing a crisis of faith, the Jesuit mission superior, Francis Dzierozynski, sent him to Rome at his own expense and without the permission of the Superior General in the hope that he could resolve his doubts there. As a pretext for his departure, Dzierozynski charged him with visiting various French cities to raise money to finance the return voyage of a group of Maryland Jesuits who had gone to Europe, and he resided in Marseille for a time. This fundraising effort was not successful. Dubuisson settled in Rome on 1 November 1826, to begin his tertianship. For the next year, he would also serve as an advisor to the Superior General on American affairs, before being sent to the University of Turin. Dubuisson became proficient in Italian and enjoyed the religious life in Turin. When Jan Roothaan was succeeded Fortis as Superior General, he called Dubuisson to Rome, where Dubuisson professed his final vows in 1829, becoming a full member of the Jesuit order.  Return to the United States  In August 1829, Roothaan sent Dubuisson back to the United States with the responsibility of keeping him informed about the affairs of the Jesuits' Maryland mission. During his travels through Europe on the way to America, he was successful in raising funds for the Maryland Jesuits among wealthy Italian and French nobles. On 23 October, Dubuisson departed Le Havre, France for New York City, from where he traveled to Frederick, Maryland. Soon thereafter, the Archbishop of Baltimore, James Whitfield, assigned him to Newtown Manor, from where he would oversee all the Jesuit parishes in St. Mary's County. Dubuisson's assignment to rural Maryland did not last long, as by the following year, he again returned to Georgetown as the prefect of studies. He also taught French there, and became the de facto confessor of the nuns of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery and of the students at their school, the Georgetown Visitation Academy. With the arrival of Peter Kenney as visitor to the Maryland mission, Dubuisson was made a consultor to the visitor. As the Jesuits debated whether to sell their farms in Maryland, which would significantly change the character of the order in the United States, Dubuisson argued against such a decision, believing landownership afforded them security in the event of economic disaster. Dubuisson's position was also motivated by the fact that the farms were worked by slaves owned by the Jesuits. He believed that while the institution of slavery was not itself immoral, the Jesuits had an obligation not to sell their slaves to immoral slaveowners who would abuse them or deprive them of food, clothing, some degree of education, and the right to marry. He viewed abolitionism as dangerously idealistic and capable of producing a Reign of Terror similar to the one he lived through in France, while also ultimately harming the freed slaves. Dubuisson also praised the racially integrated Masses he observed in parts of Maryland, where blacks and whites received the Eucharist and sang in the choir on equal status. = Maryland pastoral assignments = Despite his experience in academia, Dubuisson's primary talents were in pastoral work. Therefore, soon after arriving, Kenney sent Dubuisson back to Frederick, where he assisted John McElroy in running St. John's Literary Institution and in his pastoral work. This transfer was due in part to the fact that Kenney believed it improper for a Jesuit, especially a young one, to be the confessor of nuns and female students, as it created opportunity for sexual impropriety. His pastoral work took ranged from St. Patrick's Church in Washington to St. Francis Xavier Church on the rural Newtown Manor. As such, he ministered to a wide diversity of parishioners, including prominent, established Maryland families, white immigrants who fled Haiti, black slaves, and Protestant converts. Over time, Dubuisson became a close confidant of Kenney, and the visitor eventually sent Dubuisson to Philadelphia in 1831, where he was to organize the return of the Jesuits to Old St. Joseph's Church. In August of that year, Dubuisson was transferred back to Georgetown, once again becoming the pastor of Holy Trinity Church, where he replaced John Van Lommel. There, he revived the parochial school's Sodality of Our Lady. The school had long suffered from sporadic funding, which forced it to intermittently close. Dubuisson secured a grant from Congress and raised additional funds, which put the school on stable financial footing. In February 1833, Dubuisson returned to Philadelphia as a priest at Old St. Joseph's Church, newly returned to Jesuit control; he became the pastor of the church in April of that year. He was succeeded at Holy Trinity Church by James F. M. Lucas. During this time, Dubuisson was nominated for several bishoprics, due to the support of Archbishop Whitfield of Baltimore. His name was first proposed to become the Bishop of Cincinnati, and then as the Archbishop of New Orleans; John England, the Bishop of Charleston then sought to convince him to become the Archbishop of Saint-Domingue or a missionary to Liberia. However, Dubuisson desired to remain a pastor, and appealed directly to Pope Gregory XVI. Dubuisson died on 14 August 1864 at the Jesuit novitiate in Pau, France.

Its distribution is widespread throughout the Indo-West Pacific. The species was initially described by the American carcinologist Raymond B. Manning in 1970. Its junior synonym, A. sirindhorn, was named in 1995 in honor of Princess Sirindhorn of Thailand. Taxonomic history Holotype of the junior synonym A. sirindhorn The American carcinologist Raymond B. Manning first named and described A. derijardi in 1970. Manning named the specific epithet after Raoul R. Derijard who had assembled the collection of specimens while he was working at the Station Marine de Tul√©ar. The three paratypes were deposited in the United States National Museum. Manning's species description also reclassified a specimen from British North Borneo as being A. derijardi; Michael Tweedie illustrated this specimen in 1949, initially identifying it as Lysiosquilla multifasciata. The junior synonym A. sirindhorn was named by Phaibul Naiyanetr in 1995 based on specimens from southern Thailand; its specific epithet honors Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn of Thailand due to her interest in the natural history of Thailand and because she wrote a children's book where a mantis shrimp similar to the described species plays an important role. The type specimen was deposited in the Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum in Leiden. The Australian carcinologist Shane T. Ahyong synonymized A. sirindhorn with A. derijardi in 2001. In 1995, Manning suggested A. multispinosa and A. manningi could be junior synonyms of A. derijardi writing he could \\"find no characters to separate\\" them; he included them in his synonymy list prefixed with a question mark. The Indonesian marine biologist Mohammad Kassim Moosa also listed these two species as question mark‚Äìtagged synonyms in a 2000 checklist. In 2001, Ahyong included these two as well as A. sirindhorn as junior synonyms of A. derijardi without using any question mark. However, subsequent research has conformed the taxonomic validity of both A. manningi and A. multispinosa as distinct species. Ahyong later included some specimens he had previously identified as A. derijardi as in fact belonging to a new, separate species: A. melissae. Distribution A. derijardi is found throughout the Indo-West Pacific: its range extends from Madagascar and the Red Sea to Australia, New Caledonia and Taiwan. The type locality for A. derijardi is Grand R√©cif of Toliara, in southwestern Madagascar; the three other specimens in the type series came from Tinakta Island, Tawi-Tawi Group, Sulu Archipelago, in the southwestern Philippines. The type locality for the junior synonym A. sirindhorn was a fishing harbor near Pattani in southern Thailand. The Dutch carcinologist Lipke Holthuis recorded a specimen of A. derijardi collected from the Gulf of Eilat at the northern tip of the Red Sea in 1975 marking one of the extremes of the species's range. Ayhong has documented this species on Big Sister's Island in Singapore, and Tweedie's misidentified specimen was from Sandakan, now in Malaysia. Within Indonesia, Moosa has also noted specimens in Jakarta Bay on Kai Dulah Island, Kai Islands, Maluku Islands, and in the Java Sea. It has also been found in Taiwan, specifically Donggang fishing port in Pingtung County. Ayhong also included A. derijardi in a checklist of Japanese stomatopods. Specimens have also been found in New Caledonia. and the Chesterfield Islands. The United States National Museum has a specimen from Jokaj Island, Pohnpei, in the Caroline Islands; which Holthuis identifies as being A. derijardi. Ahyong has also recorded specimens from Little Trunk Reef, off Queensland, Australia. A specimen tentatively identified as A. derijardi was collected in the Seychelles. They are found in the intertidal zone up to a depth of . Description The telson's dorsal row of spines has one median spine, three submedian spines, and six lateral spines. The dactylus of the raptorial claw has a large distal lobe on the outer proximal margin, which can extend distally to the fifth occlusal tooth. The rostral plate consists of a long proximal trapezoidal section and a rostral spine whose length is less than a quarter of the total rostral length. Males can have a total length of ; femals can have a total length of . Their body is light in color but dark bands span across it transversely. The telson and uropod both have dark, diffuse colloration; the distal segment on the uropodal exopod is dark on its inner half.

At the time of their arrival, Quebec's confessional school system prohibited Jews from attending French- language Catholic schools, relegating them to the English-language Protestant public school system. The existing Jewish community, meanwhile, which had historically associated with the anglophone minority, had no French institutions to offer the new immigrants. At its fifteenth plenary session in May 1968, the Canadian Jewish Congress committed to assisting the Association s√©farade francophone (the main organ of the francophone Jewish community) in creating a French-language Jewish school in Montreal. A committee representing both groups met with the Ministry of Education to discuss implementation of the motion. The project was approved and √âcole Ma√Ømonide formed in 1969, initially in a wing of the Catholic Saint Antonin School, with costs shared by the Montreal Catholic School Commission, Allied Jewish Community Services, and the United Jewish Relief Agencies of Canada. The school moved to its own premises in C√¥te Saint-Luc in 1972. The school opened its second campus in Saint-Laurent in 1990. Academics In the 2018 Fraser Institute Quebec secondary school rankings, the Jacob Safra Campus was ranked 44th in the province and the Parkhaven Campus was ranked 194th (out of 452).

Prior to becoming a photographer Soho had high-profile careers as a designer, musician, and businessman. At the age of 40 he began to dedicate himself exclusively to photography. In 2017 he won first place in the World Photographic Cup in the Nature (Landscape and Wildlife) category for his image ‚ÄúBelieve.‚Äù Forbes magazine named him as one of the most creative Mexicans of 2017, and he is widely acknowledged as one of Mexico's most important contemporary photographers Early life and musical career Pepe Soho's father, Eduardo Askenazi, was a businessman in the textile industry. His mother, Paz Cohen, is a sculptress and painter. Soho expressed an early interest in art, photography, and music. He and began taking lessons and playing the drums at the age of 12. By the end of the 1980s, before Soho was yet 20 years old, he was playing drums in a prestigious nightclub in Mexico City called Sugar. He shared the stage with important Mexican rock bands and singers like Sabo Romo, and Leonardo de Lozanne. He was also part of the tour Tremendo of the band Magneto. In 1990, he moved to Los Angeles, California, to continue studying percussion at The Musicians Institute. There joined the rock group Ash Gallery with fellow Mexican Atto Attie and played on and off with this band for almost three years in famous venues such as the Whisky A Go Go and The Roxy. He simultaneously joined the band of the Bull Dog Caf√© bar in Mexico, where he played for two years collaborating with artists such as √Ålex Lora, Alejandra Guzm√°n and Erik Rub√≠n. Fashion design and entertainment In 1993, Soho opened a used record store in the Condesa neighborhood of Mexico City where he also sold a limited selection of designer clothes. Soon thereafter he began designing and selling his own clothing, beginning with printed T-shirts of rock bands. A year later he opened his first clothing store called SOHO, the name by which he became commonly known. By the year 2000, the iconic brand had expanded to twenty stores in Mexico City and other states. SOHO runways enlisted the participation of Mexican TV personalities such as Sebasti√°n Rulli, Cynthia Klitbo, Galilea Montijo, Leonardo Garc√≠a, Francisco de la O and Braulio Luna. The fashion shows were staged in popular venues and attracted record crowds. In 2007 Soho designed and opened a popular nightclub in the city: \\"LOVE\\", in the neighborhood of Polanco. Photography Soho credits a near-death experience for revitalizing his childhood interest in photography and a renewed appreciation for the natural world. In 2011, Soho traveled to India to take part in a 3-month meditation retreat. Shortly into the trip, however, he suffered a brutal accident while riding a horse that broke both his knees. The accident forced him to return to Mexico in a wheelchair. Soho underwent numerous surgeries and endured a long recovery. The medical treatments weakened his immune system and he was eventually diagnosed with Systemic Candidiasis, which caused extreme weight loss and pain. Soho battled with severe depression until he began to regain mobility and his overall health in 2013. On brief walks in the Bosque de Chapultepec he started taking photographs, primarily as a means of distraction. Nine months later he applied to a photography school in Mexico City and went on to study at the International Center of Photography (ICP), in New York City. Upon concluding his studies, he undertook various photography expeditions that would take him to more than 50 countries around the world, starting in Antarctica. His current focus on the landscape of his native Mexico. In 2014 Soho opened a gallery in the neighborhood of Polanco to showcase his work. Within a few years he opened an additional space in Mexico City and three others in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato; and Playa del Carmen, and Tul√∫m in Quintana Roo. Awards and recognition In 2018 he was listed in Forbes Mexico as one of Mexico's most creative people, an honor that recognizes individuals of significant influence and momentum. In the same year, One Hundred Artists You Can‚Äôt Miss of Mexico and the National Tourism Guide named Soho as one of the country's best artists, praising his craftsmanship and the global attention he has earned as an outstanding Mexican artist. In 2017 Soho's image \\"Believe,\\" shot in Chile, won first place at the World Photographic Cup in the Nature (Landscape and Wildlife) category. Photographers from twenty-six countries on four continents participated in this category. In his acceptance speech, Soho said, \\"Photography restored my confidence and my life. After being immersed in the emptiness of depression, capturing images through the lens of my camera was my only motivation. I found in this art form a way of expressing my love for life and the admiration I have for nature ... I am very proud to have been honored with this award, but even more to represent my country and through my work show the world how wonderful Mexico is.\\" In 2016 the Mexican Photographic Committee invited Soho to participate in the Photographic World Cup, which was held that year in Portugal. His work \\"Zen,\\" shot in Mozambique, won fourth place in the Nature (Landscape and Wildlife) category.

A staple on the downtown New York City music scene, he first achieved prominence in the mid-1990s, with his band MEOW, his role in Roy Nathanson‚Äôs Fire at Keaton‚Äôs Bar and Grill, and a stint as the understudy for the roles of Roger and Mark in the original Broadway cast of RENT. The Village Voice‚Äôs Rob Tannebaum credited Driver with creating ‚Äúan oblique Downtown twist on saloon singing, devoid of melodrama, like Jerry Vale dreaming of Chet Baker.‚Äù The Advocate‚Äôs Andrew Velez wrote that Driver‚Äôs voice ‚Äúis as bracing as a double Bourbon.‚Äù  Early life  David Driver was born in Syracuse, New York and raised in Skaneateles, New York, the youngest of five children. When he was quite young, two of his siblings died in separate accidents; an experience which he has said marked him and shaped his world view. He knew from an early age that he wanted to perform. His mother was a visual artist, water safety instructor, and coach for The Barracudas, a women's synchronized swim team. His father grew up in a gothic mansion in Northampton, MA, served in World War II, worked as a traveling salesman, and eventually operated an industrial manufacturing facility. His early influences all combine glitter and grit: Deborah Harry, Detective David Starsky of TV's Starsky and Hutch, Liza Minnelli, Gladys Knight, Henry Mancini, and Queen. Driver moved to New York City after high school and attended Parsons School of Design. In New York, he edited and authored the zine ‚ÄòBuddy‚Äô with his partner, the writer Jason Tougaw.  Music  Driver's first pop band, formed with Marty Beller (MEOW, They Might Be Giants) was The Scouts, whose first performance was at New York's legendary CBGB. In addition to MEOW and The Scouts, Driver has been frontman for Driver Quartet and one half of the duo Phillips & Driver, with Austin-based vocalist Gretchen Phillips. In 2015, he formed the electronica duo LuxRd., with composer Peter Kiesewalter. LuxRd. has a released single and video, ‚ÄúGet Your Fucking Hope Back,‚Äù a protest song released after the 2016 elections. Ian Pai (Fischerspooner, AVAN LAVA, Blue Man Group) produced a ‚ÄúResistance Remix‚Äù of the song. James Matthew Daniel directed music videos for both versions. He also appears on recordings by They Might Be Giants, Roy Nathanson, Heidi Rodewald, and Julia Greenberg. More recently, he has collaborated with multi-instrumentalist Dana Lyn in the band 401(k). His recordings have been released by Enemy Records, Bar None, and Comma Records.  Performance  Driver has been widely recognized for his intelligent, wry, and emotionally raw performance style. With Grammy-nominated avant-jazz master Roy Nathanson, he has performed at New York's Lincoln Center, London's Royal Festival Hall, the Manchester Opera House, Utrechts Jazz Festival (Netherlands), and Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, alongside co-stars Debbie Harry, Elvis Costello, and Psychedelic Furs frontman Richard Butler. With Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed, he has toured in support of Anderson's album Homeland, and appeared with them on the Late Night Show with David Letterman. With singer-songwriter Mary McBride, he toured Iraq and Turkey, performing for civilians and troops, and conducting workshops on American musical idioms. He portrayed lead characters Roger and Mark in the Original Broadway Cast of the Tony-winning Best Musical Rent. Subsequently, he toured Europe and the US with the satirical rock opera People Are Wrong!, in the lead role (written for him). The show, written by Robin Goldwasser and Julia Greenberg, co-created by, and starring members of, legendary ‚Äònerd-rock‚Äô band They Might Be Giants, then had an extended run at New York's Vineyard Theater. Other theater credits include the Weimar musical The Blue Flower, at New York's Second Stage, and Bei Nacht, performed in NYC as well as at California's La Jolla Playhouse under the aegis of The Streisand Festival. Driver performed The Scott Walker songbook as part of the Public Theater‚Äôs Joe‚Äôs Pub In The Park / SummerStage series at Central Park‚Äôs Delacorte Theater. At Lincoln Center and Brooklyn‚Äôs prestigious St. Ann‚Äôs Warehouse, he has performed the works of Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello, and at Symphony Space he has performed with the cast and writers of the Tony-nominated Best Musical Passing Strange, which was subsequently turned into a film by Spike Lee. Driver is a fixture at Joe McGinty‚Äôs Loser‚Äôs Lounge series (Joe‚Äôs Pub, Fez, Lincoln Center, Westbeth Theater, Mass MOCA). Driver plays the role of narrator and lead vocalist in The Good Swimmer, a theater piece co-written by Passing Strange‚Äôs Heidi Rodewald, which had its world premiere as part of Brooklyn Academy of Music's 2018 Next Wave Festival. In its review of the show, Feast of Music noted that Driver's \\"firm and steady singing always plugged directly into the emotion of each song,\\" whereas The New York Times described him as \\"nimble voiced.\\" In 2016, he premiered the LuxRd. mixed media performance piece Welcome to My HAUS (with Peter Kiesewalter). In 2018, he launched early versions of MIXED MESSAGES  On Starsky (No Hutch), an autobiographical performance piece developed in collaboration with composer Dana Lyn and dramaturg Andi Stover. Driver has been a featured vocalist / performer on The Daily Show (for which he sang the closing credits theme) and The Colbert Report (for which he portrayed an animated superhero), and has been the voice of commercial brands including Dunkin Donuts, Bridgestone Tires, Aveda, Est√©e Lauder, Johnson & Johnson, Discovery, and USA Network.  Video  As a video artist, Driver has created, produced, and directed the web series This Park Is Mine (Planet Green Network) and Sometimes the Dream Is Real (SundanceTV). This Park Is Mine was originally commissioned in 2013 for a television network that was defunct shortly after its completion. It was re- released in 2019 after Driver regained ownership. The series stars Kate McKinnon and Nathan Phillips, and features Robin Goldwasser, Nick Amadeus, and John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants.

The World Bank's projects from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s primarily focused on infrastructural and environmental projects. Logo of the World Bank Beginning with the 2008 global economic downturn and Eurozone crisis, Croatia's economy entered a recession that lasted until 2016. While still in the midst of its recession, Croatia officially became the 28th member state of the European Union (EU) on July 1, 2013. Croatia's entrance into the EU, combined with continuing financial troubles, shifted the World Bank's primary focus away from infrastructure and towards institutional financial restructuring. The World Bank financed lending projects to help Croatia converge with the EU, as well as to help the Croatian National Bank develop a financial policy that would improve Croatia's financial prospects. Following Croatia's emergence from its recession, lending from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) fell sharply to 22 million in 2016, compared to $279 million in the previous year. However, in 2017, the World Bank's commitments rose to a new high of $394 million.  Financing  Croatia has relationships with three branches of the World Bank Group: the IBRD, the IFC, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). = IBRD = Since the beginning of its relationship with Croatia in 1993, the World Bank has financed a total of 77 projects with Croatia through the IBRD. As of June 8, 2019, 65 projects were closed, five were dropped, one is in the pipeline, and six are active. Of the six active projects, five are loans totaling $369 million, and the sixth is a $370 million road guarantee. Historically, these projects largely focused on issues such as public expenditure, financial management and procurement, services and infrastructure for both the public and private sectors, and environmental policies and institutions. More recently, IBRD projects have begun to work more closely with funding from MIGA and IBRD to achieve the Country Partnership Strategy goals. Transitioning from infrastructure, these projects focus on the business environment in Croatia and on facilitating international development for Croatian companies. = IFC = As of June 7, 2019, the total value of IFC loans starting from FY2001 is approximately $608.39 million; the total value of equity is approximately $35.37 million; the total value of guarantees is $0; and the total value of risk management is $0. = MIGA = In FY2010 and FY2012, MIGA issued a total of seven project guarantees in Croatia, totaling approximately $955 million. The World Bank's strategy in Croatia The United Nations classifies Croatia as a developed economy. Croatia is considered a high-income country, making it one of the World Bank's richest borrowers. Primary education enrollment, although dipping to a historic low of 91% in 2010, hovers on average at 95% as of 2016. Since 1960, life expectancy at birth has steadily increased, reaching a high of 78.022 years in 2016. As such, borrowing from the World Bank Group is now primarily focused on promoting growth by aiding private infrastructure and financial sectors using economic lending instruments. Real GDP growth in Croatia has been historically low since the 2008‚Äì2016 recession. GDP growth decreased slightly to 2.7% in 2018, down from 2.9% in 2017. While real GDP began to increase after the end of the recession, the change might not have been quick enough to offset the growth of public debt, which will further contribute to poverty in the long-term. The country's unemployment rate peaked from 2013 to 2014 at 17.3% and has gradually decreased, with projections of unemployment dropping lower than 12.5% by 2018. The stagnated decrease in national poverty may be a long-term trend resulting from the recession, implicating that this will continue to slow economic growth in the long-term. As of 2018, the poverty rate has seen a slight decrease to 4.6%, but GDP has only had moderate growth. A projected government deficit, a decrease in private investment, slow structural labor reforms, and the low absorption of EU funds have contributed to an overall concern for Croatia's lower-income population's poverty rates. = Country Partnership Strategy 2014‚Äì2017 = The primary goal of the World Bank's Croatia Country Partnership Strategy FY14-17 was to facilitate Croatia's addition to the EU by implementing structural financial reforms to aid convergence. With Croatia's entry to the EU, grants increased seven times to ‚Ç¨290 million in 2013. The World Bank planned to help Croatia achieve effective EU membership by emphasizing strong economic fundamentals, based on a combination of three ‚Äúpillars\\" that would be interdependent on grants from the EU while simultaneously enacting reforms to carry out policy goals of the EU. The first pillar was public finance, which emphasized the need for fiscal consolidation in government budgets and health to keep growth steady in the medium-term and long-term. The World Bank planned to improve relations with the Croatian National Bank (CNB) and Ministry of Finance and to oversee the utilization of financial instruments to complement development policy loans (DPL). The first pillar focused on the need for fiscal adjustment while continuing to make policy-based loans to support structural reform. The second pillar was competitiveness, which aimed to increase Croatia's private-sector share of the economy, which was 70% at the time and low compared to those of the other members of the EU. Goals included strengthening public infrastructure, including railways, transit, and other enterprises; improving market oversight by introducing red tape reforms to an inefficient administrative system; and encouraging a private sector-led transition to a knowledge economy for investment and post-privatization financing. The third pillar was EU membership, which targeted both reforms to align with the Europe 2020 Strategy using EU funds and reforms to accommodate the expansion of the public sector to better absorb and utilize EU funds. The strategy identified Croatia's natural geography along the coast of the Adriatic Sea as an opportunity for improved regional cooperative relationships with nearby countries and trading partners Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, and Austria. The strategy anticipated that reform goals might be both lending (financial) and non-lending (institutional) in nature, primarily focusing on a closer adherence to EU standards of gender parity in employment. = Country Partnership Framework FY2019‚ÄìFY2024 = On May 7, 2019, the World Bank Group disclosed its Croatia Country Partnership Framework for FY19-FY24. The overarching objective of the Country Partnership Framework is to support capacity building needed for Croatia's EU convergence and eventual World Bank donor status. The FY19-FY24 Country Partnership Framework also identifies three areas of focus: enhancing public sector performance and institutions, preserving and leveraging natural capital to ensure low carbon growth, and strengthening market institutions to enable a dynamic enterprise sector. Notable projects= Second Rijeka Gateway Project (ongoing) = A railway bridge in the port of Rijeka (circa 2009), the primary seaport in Croatia, before the completion of the Second Rijeka Gateway Project. Begun in 2008 and slated to finish by December 2018, the second Rijeka Gateway Project has been a massive infrastructure project to revitalize and modernize the port of Rijeka, the largest seaport in Croatia with a historically favorable geographic location on the Adriatic Sea. The second Rijeka Gateway project will improve infrastructure that builds a better connection between the port and highways, improve quality of service for private sector investments, and increase capacity in the port of Rijeka. Specifically, the improved quality of services will include increased Rijeka port container capacity, increased container traffic, and increased container terminal efficiency. Port service enhancement and terminal development are the target goals to increase private sector involvement, by increasing the portion of dry cargo port activities operated by a private majority ownership sector from a baseline of 29% in 2007 to an end target of 65% in 2018. The project also targets improved financial performance in the public sector by reducing subsidies for interest as a percentage of operating revenues, from a baseline of 46% in 2007 down to an end target of 10% by 2018.

Paul Getty Museum William Hogarth, After, 1730-31, J. Paul Getty Museum Before and After is a pair of comic paintings by British painter William Hogarth. He made two painted versions in 1730‚Äì31. The first version showed an exterior scene in a wooded glade, based on contemporary French pastoral f√™te galante, while a second version moved the scene indoors. Hogarth made engravings based on the second version in 1736. In each pair, based on the position and appearance of the subjects, the first painting shows the couple before and the second after sexual intercourse. First painted version The first version, painted 1730‚Äì31, is now held by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, bequeathed by the merchant banker Arnold John Hugh Smith in 1964. Each oil on canvas painting measures In Before, a young man in blue clothing is making ardent advances, while his coy lover dressed in red shies away. A number of details suggest what will happen next: apples are falling from her lap, his knee points suggestively towards her, and his trousers are bulging. In the accompanying After, their faces are flushed and their clothes disarrayed, revealing her thighs and his genitalia. Second painted version The second painted versions, also painted 1730‚Äì31, are now held by the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, acquired in 1978 from the estate of J. Paul Getty. The pair is in a more upright format: Before measures and After measures . In Before, a man in red breeches sits on a green-draped bed, lustily pulling a woman towards him. An open drawer in a dressing table reveals two books, \\"The Practice of Piety\\" at the front and hidden at the back a book on courtship and a love letter. She resists, holding onto the dressing table, while her small spaniel barks. In After, the couple are flushed: the man is pensively pulling up his breeches, while the woman clings to the man, her bonnet and skirts disarrayed. The dog sleeps on the floor beside the overturned dressing table, its mirror lying broken on the floor. The paintings are thought to have been commissioned by John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu. The male protagonist was traditionally identified as John Willes, later Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. They were made around the time Hogarth was working on his paintings of A Harlot's Progress. Engraving Hogarth made engravings of Before and After in 1736, around the time as Hogarth was working on his painting Four Times of the Day, and engravings such as The Distrest Poet. The engravings were based on the second version of the paintings, with some alterations and embellishments. The scenes are also set in a bedroom, with an older man in a wig pulling the young woman towards him, with a dog jumping up and furniture tumbling down. In the background, a picture on the wall shows a cherub is lighting the fuse of a rocket, while the mirror on the dressing table hides a second picture. The woman's resistance may be for the sake of appearances rather than a genuine attempt to escape, as she has already discarded her corset, which lies on a chair. In the accompanying After, the figures' clothes are disarrayed. The woman clings to the man as he pulls up his breeches. The dog has gone to sleep amid the overturned furniture and broken mirror. On the floor is a book by Aristotle entitled Omne Animal Post Coitum Triste (every animal is sad after sex, a saying attributed to Galen). In the background, the hidden picture is now visible, revealing a cupid whose spent firework is returning to earth.

It was a separate peace that formally ended the state of war that had existed between these entities during the Eighty Years' War. The provinces that had formed the Union of Utrecht continued the war. Background After Don Juan of Austria, the royal governor-general of the Habsburg Netherlands had broken with the States General of the Netherlands in July 1579 and resumed hostilities the members of the Union of Brussels initially maintained their common front against the government of king Philip II of Spain. But after the death of Don Juan in October 1578 his successor, the Duke of Parma, approached a Catholic faction, known later as the \\"Malcontents\\", led by the stadtholder of Hainaut, Philip de Lalaing, 3rd Count of Lalaing and his half-brother Emanuel Philibert de Lalaing (usually referred to as \\"Montigny\\") and convinced them to engineer a breach with the Prince of Orange, the leader of the States General, over the latter's policy of \\"religious peace\\". This led to the forming of the Union of Arras in January 1579. The members of this Union (beside Hainaut the County of Artois and the cities of Lille, Douay and Orchies) then opened peace negotiations with Parma which led to the signing of a separate peace.Israel, pp. 193-196 Negotiation history The representatives of the parties to the Union of Arras already on 8 December 1578 (so before the Declaration of 6 January 1579 was sworn to) agreed on a first draft of the treaty. This was followed by a second draft of 9 January 1579 and a third draft of 6 April 1579. Then on 17 May 1579 the Treaty was signed between the representatives of Parma and the members of the Union of Arras. But still the negotiations had not ended and Parma succeeded to wrest a number of further concessions from the treaty partners, which resulted in the version of 12 September 1579, which was ratified by king Philip and promulgated in Mons. This differs on appreciable and important points from the treaty as signed on 17 May.See for a table of all articles of all drafts and versions of the treaty (in the original French text) Bussemaker, Tweede Deel, pp. 471-497 Main provisions of the treaty, as signed on 17 May 1579 * The provisions of the Pacification of Ghent, the Perpetual Edict and the Union of Brussels were reaffirmed, both by the Spanish Crown and the members of the Union of Arras (art. I) * Roman Catholicism was to be maintained by all holders of public office (art. II, XI, XII, XV) * There should be no more garrisons of foreign or mercenary troops, either paid by Spain or by the States General (art. V) * All prisoners of war would be released (art. IX)Special mention was made in this article of the eldest son of Orange, Philip William, Prince of Orange as the \\"Count of Buren\\" for whom the governor of Lille, Adrien d'Ognies would plead with the king to have him returned to the Netherlands after his abduction to Spain in 1568. But the young man was not released. The provision is not part of art IX of the treaty as ratified by Philip II on 12 September 1579; Cf.

(), was the tenth governor of al-Andalus under the Umayyad Caliphate in AD 729‚Äì730 (AH 111). He was one of a series of Arabs from Ifriqiya who served as governors in al- Andalus from 721 to 731. He succeeded Uthman ibn Abi Nis'a al-Khath'ami in April 729. According to the Mozarabic Chronicle (754) he reigned one year. The Prophetic Chronicle (883) gives him a more precise term of ten months, while Ibn Habib (878/9) gives him a shorter term of four months. The seventeenth- century Arabic historian al-Maqqari has him ruling down to March 731, a year longer than any outher source. According to the Mozarabic Chronicle, which is the earliest source by far, al-Haytham was appointed by the governor of Ifriqiya to replace Uthman. His term, which is characterised as \\"troubled\\" by the chronicler, culminated in an attempted coup d'√©tat: > After Haytham had ruled in a troubled state for ten months, he found out‚ÄîI > do not know by what craft‚Äîthat some Arabs wished to remove him from power. > He captured them and eventually extracted with whips the various details of > the rebellion. After torturing them, he cut off their heads, as he had been > secretly ordered to do by his counterparts on the other side of the sea.In . The relatives of some of those executed appealed to the governor of Ifriqiya, who \\"not many days later\\" sent a certain Muhammad with an authorization to replace al-Haytham with Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd Allah al-Ghafiqi, who had previously served as interim governor in 721. According to Ibn al-Athir, al- Haytham died in office in February or March 730 and was replaced by al- Ghafiqi, but the Mozarabic Chronicle is more trustworthy here. It recounts that al-Ghafiqi could not immediately be found and so Muhammad \\"not many days later\\" arrested al-Haytham and brought him back with him to Ifriqiya. He was succeeded by Muhammad ibn Abd Allah al-Ashja'i.

He was one of a series of Arabs from Ifriqiya who served as governors in al-Andalus from 721 to 731. After ten months in office, Muhammad's predecessor, al-Haytham, was confronted by an attempted coup d'√©tat in early 730. He arrested the conspirators, but their relatives in turn complained about his heavy-handedness to his superior, the governor of Ifriqiya. According to the Chronicle of 754, the earliest source, al-Haytham was arrested and brought to Ifriqiya, but because his intended replacement, al-Qhafiqi, could not be found, Muhammad was appointed to replace him instead. His formal appointment took place, according to the Chronicle, one month after al-Haytham had been removed.In . According to the Prophetic Chronicle, written in 883, he only governed for one month. Al- Maqqari, a very late source, puts his term of office in March‚ÄìMay 731, a year later than the earlier chronicles indicate, but right before the generally accepted date for when al-Ghafiqi finally took up office.

The site has been protected by the Japanese government as a National Historic Site since 1990. Background K≈çri-Nishiyama Castle is located on top of Mount Takadate, a 100-meter hill east of the center of the modern town of Koori where the geography form a bottleneck connecting the Fukushima Basin with central Mutsu Province. In the modern period, the T≈çhoku Shinkansen and T≈çhoku Expressway follow the path of the ancient ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç, passing just beneath the site of K≈çri-Nishiyama Castle to exit Fukushima Prefecture.  History  During the late Heian period, northern Japan was controlled by the Northern Fujiwara clan based at Hiraizumi. After the start of the Kamakura shogunate, Minamoto no Yoritomo led an army and defeated the Northern Fujiwara at the Battle of Koromo River in 1189. Afterwards, their territory was divided amongst Yoritomo's generals as spoils of war, and the Isa clan received what is now part of northern Fukushima Prefecture, A branch of the Isa clan relocated to this area, building Yanagawa Castle on the banks of the Abukuma River, and renamed themselves the Date clan. Following the fall of the Kamakura Shogunate in 1333, the Date pledged fealty to the Southern Court of Emperor Go-Daigo and accompanied Kitabatake Akiie on two expeditions to Kyoto; however, seeing the weakness of the Southern Court, the Date changed their allegiance nominally to the Muromachi shogunate, but in reality acted independently of outside control and expanded their territory to the west into the Yonezawa Basin and north into what is now southern Miyagi. In 1532, Date Tanemune relocated his seat from Yanagawa Castle to K≈çri-Nishiyama Castle. Tanemune's son, Date Harumune revolted against his father in 1542, protesting what he felt was a reckless policy of expansion and antagonizing the Date clan's powerful neighbors. Harumune seized Tanemune at K≈çri-Nishiyama Castle, but he was rescued by his henchmen, and a civil war erupted in the Date territories. Harumune eventually prevailed, and moved the seat of the Date from K≈çri-Nishiyama Castle to Yonezawa Castle in 1548, keeping K≈çri-Nishiyama Castle to control the Fukushima Basin. Harumune's son was the famous Date Masamune, who relocated from Yonezawa to Kurokawa Castle in Aizu. However, in 1591, Masamune submitted to Toyotomi Hideyoshi and was ordered to relocate his territories further north to Iwadeyama Castle. K≈çri-Nishiyama Castle was abandoned at that time. Design of K≈çri-Nishiyama Castle K≈çri-Nishiyama Castle was typical of Sengoku period mountain forts in that it consisted of several enclosures spread across a long and narrow ridge, utilising the natural terrain (the steep cliff and nearby cliff and nearby Ubugasawa River), as part of its defences. The castle extends over 600 meters of mountain ridges and consists of five enclosures protected by dry moats. The inner bailey is located in the center, and is roughly 100 meters long, and was protected by a simple clay walls. The main gate was to the west, where some remnants of clay and stone walls remain. The western enclosures are at a higher level, with the highest enclosure measuring 100 by 60 meters, separated into two sections. This may have been used as the inner bailey towards the end of the castle's history. At the southern end of this enclosure was a masugata-style gate. At present, all of the structures of this castle are in ruins, and all that can be seen are some fragments of clay and stone walls and moats, and the layers of terraces on the mountaintop.

His association with the SPD led to him being a co-defendant in the Leipzig high treason trial. He was a journalist for papers in both Germany and in the United States. Early life and education Adolf Hepner was born on November 24, 1846 in Schmiegel, Posen (moden day ≈ömigiel, Poland). He went to the gymnasium school in Lissa (modern day Leszno) before his stint in a Breslau Rabbinical seminary. He attended college at the University of Breslau (modern day University of Wroc≈Çaw) before he went to college at the University of Berlin. Career In 1868, Hepner began to become a socialist and he moved on to Leipzig where became an editor for a socialistic paper. He was associated with Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel around his time at the paper. In 1872 he was tried for high treason and soon acquitted with his treason charges stemming from Hepner promoting socialist activities through journalism. His co defendants, Liebknecht and Bebel weren't acquitted like he was.August Bebel: Aus meinem Leben. Zweiter Teil., Dietz Verlag, Berlin 1946, unver√§nderter Nachdruck der 1.

On September 6, 1872 at the Hague, Hepner made a speech in support of German workers where he expressed his views on how the lack of authority felled the commune.Die I. Internationale in Deutschland. Berlin 1964, S. 673. Hepner was put in jail not too long after in part due to Hepner offending the chief constable but he was soon released. Back at the Der Volksstaat, Hepner's rocky relationship with Theodor Yorck eventually led to Hepner being let go of his role at the paper.August Bebel: Aus meinem Leben. Zweiter Teil. Dietz Verlag, Berlin 1946, S. 243. Hepner moved to Breslau after he was forced out of Leipsic and subsequently he began a failed job as a publisher for his A. Hepner Breslau publishing house. Hepner moved to St. Louis in 1886 after emigrating to the United States four years earlier due to oppression he faced there as a socialist. He got back into editing as he was an editor for the St. Louis Tageblatt where he worked for ten years from 1888 to 1898.Hrsg. von der St. Louis Workingman's Publishing Association vom 30.

Plot Three brothers are born in a slum. Kuroki, the eldest brother, leaves to join a yakuza organization. Jir≈ç, the middle brother, leaves five years later, leaving the youngest brother Sabu to care for their mother alone. Kuroki's organization sets up Jir≈ç to be arrested and he spends five years in jail. When he is released, he finds Sabu and others carrying is mothers coffin away and Sabu tells him that their mother would not have wanted to see him anyway because he stole her money when he left. At the opening of Club Phoenix, Kuroki's boss tells him that Jir≈ç has been released and that he must keep him close in order to keep an eye on him. Sabu attempts to bring their mother's cremated remains to Kuroki but Kuroki gives him money for a grave and kicks him out. Sabu throws the remains in the river and uses the money to celebrate his freedom with his friends. At the Mizuhara Trading office, Jir≈ç and Mizuhara plot to rob 20 million yen from the Iwasaki Group as it is being transported. Kuroki arrives and gives Jir≈ç money to leave town but Jir≈ç buys forged passports and cheaply recruits Sabu and Sabu's friends to help with the robbery. At the airport, Sabu's friends stage a brawl as a distraction while Jir≈ç and Mizuhara stick up the three bagmen at gunpoint and put sunglasses covered in black tape over their eyes to blind them as Sabu and Mako grab the bags of money and flee. Jir≈ç attempts to rob the money from Sabu at Sabu's hideout but only finds Mako, who says that Sabu has left with the bags. Mizuhara also arrives and fruitlessly attempts to rob the money from Jir≈ç. Sabu's friends arrive and one of them, Akira, is killed in a struggle with Mizuhara. Jir≈ç's lover Ky≈çko enters and tells them that the locals are gathering outside. Jir≈ç convinces the locals that he is Kuroki from the Iwasaki Group investigating people who have betrayed the Group and tells them not to interfere. Sabu arrives and tells his friends that they have been betrayed because the bags contained 20 million yen in cash and 20 million yen in drugs, despite the meager cut promised to them. After being overpowered, Sabu refuses to give up the location of the bags despite being beaten so Jir≈ç and Mizuhara torture his friends one by one to make him talk. Iwasaki sends Kuroki to investigate and Kuroki goes to the slum but leaves after only finding black tape in Sabu's house. Sabu's friend Hiroshi lies to Jir≈ç that the bags were left at the club. Jir≈ç takes Sabu's gun to the club, where he is attacked by Iwasaki members who had been following Kuroki. They learn from the club owner that Jir≈ç was looking for Sabu's bags, which leads them to link the robbery to Kuroki when they find the black tape on him. Sabu and his friends escape and run in different directions but Hiroshi is caught by the Iwasaki Group and the others return to Jir≈ç and Mizuhara. Kuroki, arriving to be questioned, sees a beaten Hiroshi being put into the trunk of a car. He is told that he is responsible for his brothers and must get the drugs and money back. Jir≈ç and Mizuhara continue torturing Sabu but Sabu refuses to talk and breaks his own hands with bricks to prove his determination. Kuroki arrives and attempts to take Sabu away but they all know that Sabu will be tortured by the Iwasaki Group so Sabu refuses to leave. Kuroki threatens to torture Mizuhara to make them talk but Mizuhara begs for ten minutes to talk things over with the other participants in the robbery. Mizuhara threatens to shoot one of Sabu's friends but is shot by Jir≈ç. Kuroki holds the members of the Iwasaki Organization at bay outside and begs Sabu to surrender. Takeshi surrenders but is shot in the back by Sabu, who joins forces with Jir≈ç and tells Kuroki that he must join them and fight against the Iwasaki Group if he wants to know where the bags are. As Kuroki stands to make his decision, the other members of the Iwasaki Group storm the hideout and kill everyone inside. As Kuroki walks away the slum-dwellers pelt him with objects, including a dead rat.

It has also been released under the titles Wolves, Pigs and People, and Wolf, Pig, and Man. Reception In a positive review in Critics Roundup, reviewer Marc Walkow wrote, \\"For the first few years of his career, Fukusaku and Toei were more or less content to mimic the stle and feel of rival Nikkatsu's popular 'borderless action' films... But Fukusaku's sixth film, Wolves, Pigs and Men (64), broke the mold by taking the best elements from his earlier films and adding a biting commentary on the social problems endemic to Japan's transition from postwar defeated nation to economic powerhouse.\\" In the book Historical Dictionary of Japanese Cinema, author Jasper Sharp writes that, along with Gang vs. G-Men, \\"Wolves, Pigs and Men, which pitted three slum-dwelling gangster brothers against one another, established Fukasaku's pattern for contemporary action and crime dramas inspired by the French New Wave and American noir, featuring realistic portrayals of violence and often set in chaotic, working-class milieux.\\" ReferencesExternal links * 1964 films 1960s Japanese films 1964 crime films Japanese black-and-white films Japanese films Japanese crime films Films directed by Kinji Fukasaku Japanese-language films Toei Company films Yakuza films Films set in Yokohama Films about brothers Films about poverty Films about robbery ","title":"Wolves, Pigs and Men"},{"id":"59149335","text":"Jessore Institute Public Library is a public library in Jessore Town founded in 1854.

In 2018, the organization was acquired by the Bob Woodruff Foundation. History In May 2012, it was announced that a collection of various entertainment industry and media companies were joining together with twenty-four nonprofit organizations for a campaign whose goal was to create awareness of veterans' issues such as employment, health, housing, and education. Some of these issues also formed the six \\"pillars\\" of the organization which included jobs, education, housing, health, family, and leadership. Focusing on each of these \\"pillars\\", the organization set out various goals and targets related to them such as 500,000 jobs for veterans, housing 10,000 chronically homeless veterans, and the completion of 1.5 million volunteer service hours by veterans. All of the commitments were expected to be formalized by Clinton Global Initiative. Participating entertainment companies consisted of A+E Networks, American Broadcasting Company, Bad Robot Productions, Creative Artists Agency, CBS Corporation, Directors Guild of America, Entertainment Industries Council, Entertainment Industry Foundation, Fox Audience Strategy, foursquare, Funny or Die, HBO, International Creative Management, NBCUniversal, Paramount Pictures, Producers Guild of America, SAG-AFTRA, Shine America, Showtime Networks, Sony Pictures Entertainment, United Talent Agency, Viacom Media Networks, Warner Bros., William Morris Endeavor, and Writers Guild of America, West. The organization was expected to use their partner organizations' resources such as ilm, television, gaming, print, radio, outdoor media and social media platforms to further their message. A public service announcement publicizing the organization was released alongside the announcement which included appearances from Alec Baldwin, Michael Douglas, Tom Hanks, Milla Jovovich, Bradley Cooper, Sarah Jessica Parker, Tracy Morgan, Brian Williams, Pharrell Williams, and Wendy Williams A year later, the organization partnered with Macy's for a new \\"American Icons\\" campaign where the retailer offered a \\"Got Your 6\\" logo pin and a special savings pass for $6 at their stores nationwide. Additionally, the also released a new PSA featuring singer Gavin DeGraw. By 2017, Macy's reported that they had raised more than $8.3 million dollars for the organization. That Veterans Day, the organization recruited country music singers who attended that year's Country Music Association Awards to take part in another PSA for the non-profit. Artists included Taylor Swift, Florida Georgia Line, Kenny Rogers, and Cassadee Pope. In January 2014, it was announced that the organization was receiving funds from the Lone Survivor Fund, created by Lone Survivor director Peter Berg, along with two other veterans organizations. The fund raised over $100,000 during the opening weekend of that film largely through private screenings. Later that October, it was reported that MTV had partnered with the organization on a new documentary titled MTV's Got Your 6 that follows four military veterans as they return from Afghanistan and attempt to return to their communities and past lives. The documentary was produced by Karga Seven Pictures and executive producers included Dave Sirulnick, Jonathan Mussman, Sarah Wetherbee, Kelly Mcpherson, Emre Sahin and Kim Kanter. The film premiered on MTV on November 11, 2014. Beginning in 2017, the organization began to release a list of films, television programs, and theatrical productions that they say portray veterans in a more accurate light. The list of productions from 2016 included One Day at a Time, Patriots Day, Six, The War Horse News, and Blueprint Specials. The list of productions from 2017 included The Gifted, Disjointed, Last Flag Flying, The Long Road Home, and Returning the Favor. In November 2017, it was also announced that the organization had partnered with Veterans in Media and Entertainment on a new fellowship program, the Veterans Fellowship Program, designed to help military veterans build careers in the entertainment industry. The initiative was expected to be funded by Got Your 6 and Macy's. The fellowship includes the pairing of veterans with mentors, monthly educational and training sessions, and networking events. Media companies taking part in the fellowship included 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal, CBS, HBO, Viacom, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Lionsgate, A+E Networks, Live Nation Entertainment, United Talent Agency, 44 Blue, The Ebersol Lanigan Company, DreamWorks Animation, Endemol Shine North America, and Valhalla Entertainment.

It opened on 12 October 2018 and replaced the nearby Christchurch Central Library that was closed on the day of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Location and prior buildings T≈´ranga is located in the north-eastern quadrant of Cathedral Square and fronts Gloucester and Colombo Streets. The original wooden building on the site was demolished in 1885; the then-owner Fred Hobbs replaced it with a substantial building of permanent materials that became known as Cathedral Chambers. The location had earlier become known as Hobbs' Corner after its prominent owner who had painted his name on the wooden building. Cathedral Chambers was replaced with the Colonial Mutual Limited (or CML) building in 1975, so named after its main tenant. This office building was later converted to a hotel and was last known as the Camelot Hotel. History The previous library closed with the 2011 Christchurch earthquake as the Christchurch Central City was cordoned off. The 2012 Christchurch Central Recovery Plan, commonly referred to as the Blueprint, identified 17 anchor projects, including a new central library. Through the Blueprint, the responsibility for delivering the building was assigned to Christchurch City Council. Partners for the delivery were NgƒÅi Tahu and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA). The indicative project delivery schedule in the Blueprint, developed on behalf of CERA, showed a proposed opening of the new library during the third quarter of 2015. In a publication titled Anchor Projects Overview updated in June 2014, the opening date was shown as January 2017. In a pamphlet published by CERA in November 2014, the anticipated opening date was shown for the third quarter of 2017. On 26 March 2015, plans for a new $85 million dollar library were unveiled to city councillors. The new library, named T≈´ranga (from the MƒÅori language), is one-third larger than the previous library, the largest library in the South Island and the third-largest in New Zealand, behind Auckland and Wellington's central libraries. The replacement library was designed by both Architectus, a New Zealand architecture firm, and Schmidt Hammer Lassen, an award-winning Danish architecture firm. The building's design is inspired by the golden hues reflected upon the Port Hills, which are an important part in Christchurch's cityscape. Soon after construction started on the new library, the Christchurch City Council increased their contribution to the library from $60 million to $95 million. This controversial cost increase was due to multiple factors, such as acquiring land and inflation. The library was opened to the public on 12 October 2018, with over 13,000 people visiting on its opening weekend. The library has won a number of awards. Naming The library's name was offered by Te NgƒÅi T≈´ƒÅhuriri r≈´nanga. It makes reference to Whitireia, the MƒÅori name for Cathedral Square. Paikea was an ancestor of NgƒÅi Tahu and Whitireia was the name of his house located in T≈´ranga, the original name for Gisborne in the North Island. The name thus values the location where Paikea's house was located. Christchurch city councillors approved the name in September 2017. There was an initial intention to give the library an English descriptor of \\"A Place of Discovery\\" but this idea was dropped and there is no English word for Christchurch's central library.

Gameplay Prop Cycle is a 3D, time-based flying game in which the player must use a human- powered aircraft to prevent the city of Solitar from floating away permanently by popping hot-air balloons. The cycle is controlled by using pedals to spin the propeller and handlebars to steer left and right and change altitude. Development and release Prop Cycle was designed by Shigeki Toyama, an engineer for Namco that worked on games such as Xevious (1983), Final Lap (1987), and Point Blank (1994). Toyama was inspired to create Prop Cycle after he and another Namco employee finished production on a technical demo where the player rode in a human-powered plane and shot down enemies. The demo didn't use 3D polgyons, but instead 2D sprites with scaling techniques that created the illusion of a 3D world. While Toyama didn't find the game itself interesting, he thought its sense of flight was intriguing and decided to turn the concept into a full game. He was also inspired by the Studio Ghibli film Kiki's Delivery Service, which stars a young witch flying on a broomstick. Since Prop Cycle was being made as an arcade game, Toyama wanted the game to be highly interactive and have a reason to be exclusive to arcades. He also wanted the game to be unique and distinct from other arcade games, as he never enjoyed repeating already-existing ideas. Toyama worked to allow players to experience the thrill of flying and feeling the wind, and to make the game itself be more than simply defeating enemies. To get an idea of what Toyama was looking for, the development team went out for a day of hang gliding with a camera attached to the glider's wings. The team spent three to four months developing the flying aspect; programmer Naoyuki Koyama didn't understand what Toyama wanted to convey with \\"riding the wind\\", so to demonstrate he attached a weight to an umbrella to give Koyama an idea of what he was trying to create. Toyama wanted Prop Cycle to have a proper storyline in addition to its unique game concept. Jokingly referring to his role as the project's \\"movie director\\", Toyama designed the setting, plotline, and characters, and drew the artwork for the villages and level themes. An intentional design choice was that the player had to make it to the last stage in order to understand the story, a decision he has since come to regret. Toyama considered making a \\"Sightseeing\\" mode where players were able to fly anywhere they wanted under a time limit, however the limited development time caused the idea to be scrapped.

An organic nuclear reactor, or organic cooled reactor (OCR), is a type of nuclear reactor that uses some form of organic fluid, typically a hydrocarbon substance like polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), for cooling and sometimes as a neutron moderator as well. Using an organic fluid had a major advantage over conventional designs using water as the coolant. Water tends to corrode and dissolve metals, both the nuclear fuel and the reactor as a whole. To avoid corrosion of the fuel, it is formed into cylindrical pellets and then inserted in zirconium tubes or other \\"cladding\\" materials. The rest of the reactor has to be built out of materials that are both corrosion resistant and resistant to the effects of neutron embrittlement. In contrast, many common organic fluids are less corrosive to metals, allowing the fuel assemblies to be much simpler and the coolant pipes to be built of normal carbon steels instead of more expensive corrosion-resistant metals. Some organics also have the advantage that they do not flash into gas in the same fashion as water, which may reduce or eliminate the need for a containment building. These benefits are offset to a degree by the fact that organics also generally have a lower specific heat than water, and thus require higher flow rates to provide the same amount of cooling. A more significant problem was found in experimental devices; the high-energy neutrons given off as part of the nuclear reactions have much greater energy than the chemical bonds in the coolant, and they break the hydrocarbons apart. This results in the release of hydrogen and various shorter-chain hydrocarbons. The polymerization of the resulting products can turn into a thick tar-like state. Further, many suitable coolants are naturally flammable and sometimes toxic, which adds new safety concerns. Many uses of PCBs were banned beginning in the 1970s as their environmental toxicity was better understood. The OCR concept was a major area of research in the 1950s and 60s, including the Organic Moderated Reactor Experiment at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, the Piqua Nuclear Generating Station in Ohio, and the Canadian WR-1 at Whiteshell Laboratories. The US experiments explored the use of organics for both cooling and moderation, while the Canadian design used a heavy water moderator, as did the unbuilt EURATOM ORGEL and Danish DOR designs. Ultimately none of these would be used for commercial generators, and only the small experimental reactors at Piqua in the US and Arbus at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in the USSR ever generated power, and then only experimentally. Physics=Fission basics= Conventional fission power plants rely on the chain reaction caused when nuclear fission events release neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in uranium releases two or three neutrons, so by careful arrangement and the use of various absorber materials, you can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This careful balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of several isotopes, mainly a trace amount of U-235 and over 99% U-238. When they undergo fission, both of these isotopes release fast neutrons with an energy distribution peaking around 1 to 2 MeV. This energy is too low to cause fission in U-238, which means it cannot sustain a chain reaction. U-235 will undergo fission when struck by neutrons of this energy, so it is possible for U-235 to sustain a chain reaction, as is the case in a nuclear bomb. However, there is too little U-235 in a mass of natural uranium, and the chance any given neutron will cause fission in these isolated atoms is not high enough to reach criticality. Criticality is accomplished by concentrating, or enriching, the fuel, increasing the amount of U-235 to produce enriched uranium, while the leftover, now mostly U-238, is a waste product known as depleted uranium. U-235 will undergo fission more easily if the neutrons are of lower energy, the so-called thermal neutrons. Neutrons can be slowed to thermal energies through collisions with a neutron moderator material, the most obvious being the hydrogen atoms found in water. By placing the fission fuel in water, the probability that the neutrons will cause fission in another U-235 is greatly increased, which means the level of enrichment needed to reach criticality is greatly reduced. This leads to the concept of reactor-grade enriched uranium, with the amount of U-235 increased from less than 1% to between 3 and 5% depending on the reactor design. This is in contrast to weapons-grade enrichment, which increases the U-235 enrichment to, commonly, over 90%. =Coolants and moderators= When a neutron is moderated, its kinetic energy is transferred to the moderator material. This causes it to heat up, and by removing this heat, energy is extracted from the reactor. Water makes an excellent material for this role, both because it is an effective moderator, as well as being easily pumped and used with existing power generation equipment similar to the systems developed for steam turbines in coal fired power plants. The main disadvantage of water is that it has a relatively low boiling point, and the efficiency in extracting the energy using a turbine is a function of the operational temperature. The most common design for nuclear power plants is the pressurized water reactor (PWR), in which the water is held under pressure, on the order of 150 atmospheres, in order to raise its boiling point. These designs may operate at temperatures as high as 345 ¬∞C, which greatly improves the amount of heat that any unit of water can remove from the core, as well as improving the efficiency when it is converted to steam in the generator side of the plant. The main downside to this design is that keeping water at this pressure adds complexity, and if the pressure drops, it can flash into steam and cause a steam explosion. To avoid this, reactors generally use a strong containment building or some form of active steam suppression. A number of alternative designs have emerged that use alternative coolants or moderators. For instance, the UK's program concentrated on the use of graphite as the moderator and carbon dioxide gas as the coolant. These reactors, the Magnox and AGR operated at roughly twice the temperature as conventional water-cooled plants. This not only increases the efficiency of the turbomachinery, but is designed to allow it to run with existing coal-fired equipment that runs at the same temperature. However, they had the disadvantage of being extremely large, which added to their capital costs. In contrast, the Canadian CANDU designs used two separate masses of heavy water, one acting as the moderator in a large tank known as the calandria, and another acting solely as the coolant in a conventional pressurized loop. This design did not have the entire coolant mass under pressure, which simplified the construction of the reactor. The primary advantage was that the neutron moderation of heavy water is superior to normal water, which allowed these plants to run on natural, unenriched, uranium fuel. However, this was at the cost of using expensive heavy water. =Organic coolants and moderators= In conventional water-cooled designs, a significant amount of effort is needed to ensure that the materials making up the reactor do not dissolve or corrode into the water. Many common low-corrosion materials are not suitable for reactor use because they are not strong enough to withstand the high pressures being used, or are too easily weakened by exposure to neutron damage. This includes the fuel assemblies, which in most water-cooled designs are cast into a ceramic form and clad in zirconium to avoid them dissolving into the coolant. Selected organic-based coolants avoid this problem because they are hydrophobic and generally do not corrode metals. This is why they are often used as anti-corrosion agents and rustproofing. Greatly reducing corrosion allows the complexity of many of the reactor parts to be simplified, and fuel elements no longer require exotic formulations. In most examples the fuel was refined uranium metal in pure form with a simple cladding of stainless steel or aluminum. In the simplest organic reactor designs, one simply replaces just the coolant with the organic fluid. This is most easily accomplished when the moderator was originally separate, as is the case in the UK and Canadian designs. In this case, one can modify the existing designs to become the graphite moderated, organic cooled reactor and heavy water moderated, organic cooled reactor, respectively. Other possible moderators include beryllium, beryllium oxide, and zirconium hydride. However, the US program, by far the largest, concentrated on the organic moderated and cooled reactor design, which is conceptually similar to the pressurized water reactor, simply replacing the water with a suitable organic material. In this case the organic material is both the coolant and moderator, which places additional design limitations on the layout of the reactor. However, this is also the simplest solution from a construction and operational point of view, and saw significant development in the US, where the PWR design was already common. Another common design in US use is the boiling water reactor (BWR). In this design the water is placed under less pressure and allowed to boil in the reactor core. This limits the operational temperature, but is simpler mechanically as it eliminates the need for a separate steam generator and its associated piping and pumps. One can adapt this design to an organic moderated and cooled reactor cycle as well, which is aided by the fact that suitable organic fluids superheat on their own when they expand into the gas state, which can simplify the overall design. This last issue also has a significant safety benefit; in contrast to water, oils do not flash into steam, and thus there is no real possibility of a steam explosion. Other potential explosion sources in water-cooled designs also include the buildup of hydrogen gas caused when the zirconium cladding heats; lacking such a cladding, or any similar material anywhere in the reactor, the only source of hydrogen gas in an oil-cooled design is from the chemical breakdown of the coolant. This occurs at a relatively predictable rate, and the possibility of a hydrogen buildup is extremely remote. This greatly reduces the required containment systems. =Disadvantages= Organic-based coolants have several disadvantages as well. Among these is their relatively low heat transfer capability, roughly half that of water, which requires increased flow rates to remove the same amount of energy. Another issue is that they tend to decompose at high temperatures, and although a wide variety of potential materials were examined, only a few appeared to be stable at reasonable operational temperatures, and none could be expected to operate for extended periods above 530 C. Most are also flammable, and some are toxic, which presents safety issues. Another issue, when the oil is also the moderator, is that the moderating capability of the fluid increases as its temperature cools. This means that as the moderator heats up, it has less moderating capacity, which causes the overall reaction rate of the reactor to slow and further cool the reactor. Normally this is an important safety feature, in water-moderated reactors the opposite may occur and reactors with positive void coefficients are inherently unstable. However, in the case of an oil moderator, the temperature coefficient is so strong that it can rapidly cool. This makes it very difficult to throttle such designs for load following. But far and away the largest problem for hydrocarbon coolants was that it decomposed when exposed to radiation, an effect known as radiolysis. In contrast the heat- based decomposition, which tends to make lighter hydrocarbons, the outcome of these reactions was highly variable and resulted in many different reaction products. Water also undergoes decomposition due to radiation, but the output products are hydrogen and oxygen, which are easily recombined into water again. The resultant products of the decomposition of oils were not readily recombined, and had to be removed. One particularly worrying type of reaction occurred when the resulting products polymerized into long-chain molecules. The concern was that these would form large masses within the reactor, and especially its cooling loops, and might \\"exert significant deleterious effects on the operation of a reactor.\\" It was polymerization of the coolant sticking to the fuel cladding that led to the shutdown of the Piqua reactor after only three years of operation. History=Early experiments= Early theoretical work on the organic cooled concept was carried out at the Argonne National Laboratory between 1953 and 1956. As part of this work, Mine Safety Appliances studied a variety of potential biphenyl coolants. In 1956-75, Aerojet conducted studies on the rate of \\"burnout\\" of polyphenyl coolants, and in the following two years, Hanford Atomic Products carried out several studies of polyphenyl irradiation. Monsanto began operating a single coolant loop in the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor beginning in 1955 to study heat transfer, and in 1958 began to consider coolant reclamation and studies on boiling diphenyl coolant loops. Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) began similar studies around the same time, with an eye to the design of a future test reactor. A similar program began in the UK at Harwell in the 1950s. This soon focussed on radiation damage to organic compounds, specifically polyphenyls. Around 1960, Euratom began studies of such designs as part of their ORGEL project. A similar but separate project began in Italy under the direction of the Comitato nazionale per l'energia nucleare, but their PRO design was never built. Likewise, a major study carried out in Denmark considered the heavy water-moderated reactor. =Major experiments= The first complete organically cooled and moderated reactor design was the Organic Moderated Reactor Experiment (OMRE), which began construction at the Idaho National Laboratory in 1955 and went critical in 1957. This used Santowax (a terphenyl) for coolant and moderation and operation was generally acceptable. The reactor was a very low-energy design, producing 15 MW thermal, and operated for only a short period between 1957 and 1963. During this time the core was rebuilt three times to test different fuels, coolants and operating conditions from 260 to 370 C. It was planned that a larger 40 MW design, the terphenyl-cooled Experimental Organic Cooled Reactor (EOCR), would take over from the OMRE. It began construction at Idaho in 1962, but was never loaded with fuel when the AEC shifted their focus mostly to light water reactors. The next major reactor was a commercial prototype built as a private/public venture, the Piqua Nuclear Generating Station, which began construction in 1963 at Piqua, Ohio. This used the same Santowax coolant as the original OMRE, but was as large as the EOCR, producing 45 MW thermal and 15 MW electrical. It ran on 1.5% enriched fuel formed into annular tubes that were clad in finned aluminum casings. It ran only for a short time until 1966, when it was shut down due to films building up on the fuel cladding, formed from radiation degraded coolant. The most powerful ONR was the Canadian 60 MW thermal WR-1. It began construction at the newly formed Whiteshell Laboratories in Manitoba in 1965 and went critical late that year. WR-1 used heavy water as the moderator and terphenyls as the coolant, and did not suffer from the problems with coolant breakdown seen in the US designs. It operated until 1985, by which time AECL had standardized on using heavy water for both the moderator and the coolant, and the organic cooled design was no longer being considered for development. Although various European nations did development work on organic reactor designs, only the Soviet Union built one. Work on the 5 MW thermal Arbus NPS began in Melekess, Russia in 1963 and it ran until 1979. It produced a maximum of 750 kW of electricity. In 1979 it was rebuilt as the AST-1, this time to deliver 12 MW of process heat instead of electrical power. It ran in this form until 1988. =Renewed interest= Indian officials have periodically expressed interest in reviving the concept. They initially received CANDU design materials during the period of the WR-1 experiment. To further lower operational costs, there have been several revivals of the WR-1-like concept. It is believed that an organic coolant purification system can be developed to handle the decomposition of the organic coolant, and research has begun to this effect. However, , no experimental system has been constructed.

This group generally aimed to install conservative politician, or have moderate toe a more conservative line. This support translated into Newbury winning the preselection for Brighton, which was being vacated by Louise Asher. This was the cause of some disappointment in the Liberal ranks, as it would lead to a reduction in their female representation. Newbury's victory came with allegations of branch stacking.

Following a successful business career, Tek started collecting art works in 2004, amassing a collection of over 1,500 pieces, including a number of difficult to display 'mega art' works, he announced he would turn the collection into a non-profit public institution in 2017 following a 2015 diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. In 2018 he announced that he would partner with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) to form a foundation that would house most of his collection of Chinese contemporary art.  Early life and business  Tek was born in Jakarta and grew up in Singapore. He became a successful entrepreneur and was president/director of Indonesia-based PT Sierad Produce Tbk, with interests in poultry production through to restaurant management. He took the company to IPO in 1996, but was later forced to restructure operations in response to Indonesia's debt crisis.  Yuz collection  In 2004, Tek began collecting artworks, amassing a collection of over 1,500 pieces, the Yuz Collection. Invited by London's Tate to sit on its Asia Pacific Acquisitions Committee to raise awareness of Asia Pacific arts, Tek expanded the scope of his interests beyond Asian art to include Western art, acquiring works by artists such as Maurizio Cattelan, Fred Sandback, Anselm Kiefer and Adel Abdessemed to his collection. He has made a name for collecting large and difficult to display 'mega art' works, including a tigerskin made of 600,000 cigarettes, a high pressure fire hose which whips around in a purpose-built room, and Random International's Rain Room, a computer-controlled indoor rain shower which remains dry around visitors walking through the deluge. In 2015 he announced plans to house the Yuz Collection in Bali, including a super-sized 150-metre square version of Rain Room, but the plan was shelved due to his ill health.  Yuz Foundation  Tek founded the Yuz Foundation in 2007. It is the umbrella organization of the Yuz Collection and the Yuz Museum. The Yuz Museum was established in Jakarta and followed by Shanghai, which opened in May 2014, is a non-profit museum of contemporary art, located in the core area of Shanghai West Bund. The museum was launched with the aim of establishing itself as a new landmark for exhibiting contemporary Chinese art and to be a preeminent contemporary art museum in the world. Since its opening, it has staged exhibitions by Yang Fudong, Huang Yuxing, Liu Shiyuan, Random International, Andy Warhol and Alberto Giacometti since its opening in May 2014. Designed by Japanese Architect Sou Fujimoto and built on the old site of the aircraft hangar of the former Long Hua Airport, the museum boasts a total area of 9,000 square meters, among which the hangar-converted great hall alone covers over 3,000 square meters, complementing the numerous large-scale art installations, while the other galleries offer more than 1,000 square meters for paintings, sculptures and photography of contemporary art. In 2011, Tek was voted eighth on Art&Auction;'s list of the top 10 most influential figures in the art world. He was also listed by Business Insider as one of the 12 most influential art collectors in the world in 2011. In August 2013 he was conferred the French Legion of Honour.  Joint foundation with LACMA  Tek compared his 2018 partnership with LACMA, two years in the making, to a marriage. The move will see most of the Yuz Collection donated to a new, jointly-owned foundation. The University of Chicago art history professor Wu Hung will oversee the programme as consulting artistic director. The move will significantly expand LACMA's holding of contemporary Chinese art and followed attempts by Tek to convince the Chinese government to establish a special status for the Yuz Museum, which would have created a China-based NGO.

The churches were used because they were the natural center of public life for most places in the country, and because the parishes were the basic units of the electoral system. The parish priest was the chief official in the local community, and it was usually the parish priest that administered the elections. The elections were essentially indirect elections, in which an elector was first elected to the assembly or county council. The election assembly, which also took place in a central church, then chose the representative to send to Eidsvoll. In some small towns with only one congregation, the selection took place through direct voting. The first elections took place on a general day of prayer declared on Friday, February 25, 1814. Many of these churches have been lost since 1814. Some have burned, but most of those that are gone were torn down and replaced by new churches. About 190 election churches are preserved. On the 200th anniversary of the vote in 2014, the National Archives and the Directorate for Cultural Heritage collaborated to label the churches with blue plaques and to reprint facsimiles of the documents stating the addresses and authority of these churches.

False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not ‚Äì in other words, a query returns either \\"possibly in set\\" or \\"definitely not in set\\". A cuckoo filter can also delete existing items, which is not supported by Bloom filters. In addition, for applications that store many items and target moderately low false positive rates, cuckoo filters can achieve lower space overhead than space-optimized Bloom filters. Cuckoo filters were first described in 2014. Algorithm description A cuckoo filter uses a n-way set- associative hash table based on cuckoo hashing to store the fingerprints of all items (every bucket of the hashtable can store up to n entries). Particularly, the two potential buckets in the table for a given item x required by cuckoo hashing are calculated by the following two hash functions (termed as partial-key cuckoo hashing): :h_1(x)=\\\\text{hash}(x) :h_2(x)=h_1(x)\\\\oplus\\\\text{hash}(\\\\text{fingerprint}(x)) Applying the above two hash functions to construct a cuckoo hash table enables item relocation based only on fingerprints when retrieving the original item is impossible. As a result, when inserting a new item that requires relocating an existing item y, the other possible location j in the table for this item y kicked out from bucket i is calculated by :j = i\\\\oplus\\\\text{hash}(\\\\text{fingerprint}(y)) Based on partial-key cuckoo hashing, the hash table can achieve both highly- utilization (thanks to cuckoo hashing), and compactness because only fingerprints are stored. Lookup and delete operations of a cuckoo filter are straightforward. There are a maximum of two locations to check by h_1(x) and h_2(x). If found, the appropriate lookup or delete operation can be performed in O(1) time. More theoretical analysis of cuckoo filters can be found in the literature. Comparison to Bloom filters A cuckoo filter is similar to a Bloom filter in that they both are very fast and compact, and they may both return false positives as answers to set-membership queries: * Space-optimal Bloom filters use 1.44\\\\log_2(1/\\\\epsilon) bits of space per inserted key, where \\\\epsilon is the false positive rate. A cuckoo filter requires (\\\\log_2(1/\\\\epsilon) + 2)/\\\\alpha where \\\\alpha is the hash table load factor, which can be 95.5\\\\% based on the cuckoo filter's setting. Note that the information theoretical lower bound requires \\\\log_2(1/\\\\epsilon) bits for each item. * On a positive lookup, a space-optimal Bloom filter requires a constant \\\\log_2(1/\\\\epsilon) memory accesses into the bit array, whereas a cuckoo filter requires constant two lookups at most. * Cuckoo filters have degraded insertion speed after reaching a load threshold, when table expanding is recommended. In contrast, Bloom filters can keep inserting new items at the cost of a higher false positive rate before expansion. Limitations * A cuckoo filter can only delete items that are known to be inserted before. * Insertion can fail and rehashing is required like other cuckoo hash tables. Note that the amortized insertion complexity is still O(1).  References  External links  * Probabilistic Filters By Example ‚Äì A tutorial comparing Cuckoo and Bloom filters.

It is endemic to Peninsular Malaysia and is only known from its type locality near the top of Gunung Brinchang (=Mount Brinchang), in the Cameron Highlands, Pahang state. The specific name yongi honours Dr. Yong Hoi-Sen, a zoologist from the University of Malaya. Description Adult males measure in snout‚Äìvent length; the size of females is unknown. The overall appearance is stocky. The head is triangular, wider than it is long. The snout is obtusely pointed in dorsal view and truncate in profile. The canthus rostralis is distinct, as is the tympanum. The forelimbs are comparatively long and very stout; the fingers have rounded tips and slight basal webbing. The hind limbs are moderately long; the toes have rounded tips and poorly developed webbing. The dorsal ground color varies from light orange brown to dark chocolate brown. There are obscure dark markings. The venter is dirty cream, dusted with brown on the throat. Males have a single subgular vocal sac. The male advertisement call is an intermittently emitted, soft \\"ting\\". Habitat and conservation The type series was collected from a mossy cloud forest at elevations of above sea level. Adults are camouflaged and burrow into mosses, making them difficult to find. The diet includes spiders, grasshoppers, and weevils. Eggs and tadpoles have been found in a large cup of the pitcher plant Nepenthes macfarlanei, and tadpoles in a water-filled tree stump. Suitable mossy forests are only found on the top of the mountain and the species is likely to be a micro-endemic, not to be found more widely. The habitat is threatened by tourist activities (hiking, expanding tourist facilities). Moreover, there is illegal collection of slipper orchids that could disturb the habitat. The population occurs within the Gunung Brinchang Forest Reserve.

A part of the Crown Estate, when they are in the United Kingdom, it is the home of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. History The cottage was originally known as Double Garden Cottage and was listed in Queen Charlotte's 1801 accounts for her garden as having been built for ¬£450 by a Mr Bowen. Queen Victoria had breakfast at the cottage on 28 June 1875 and noted an \\"immense number of little frogs\\" which she found \\"quite disgusting\\". The cottage has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since October 1975. The listing provides little of the history: \\"Early C19 plain 2 storey house with parapet. Centre break with porch. Glazing bar sashes. Stucco faced.\\" =Tenants= The cottage was a retreat for Queen Charlotte and her unmarried daughters. The theologian Henry James Sr. and his family lived at the cottage in the 1840s. A personal secretary of Queen Victoria's, Abdul Karim, moved to Frogmore Cottage in 1897 with his wife and father. Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia in exile from her native Russia stayed there in the 1920s. In the early 21st century, the cottage was a series of five separate units housing Windsor estate workers. In 2019, the house was converted into a four-bedroom-and-nursery, single-family home, at a reported cost from the Sovereign Grant of ¬£2.4 million. As a property of a royal palace of state and designated heritage site, Frogmore Cottage was always scheduled to be renovated, regardless of occupant, something also confirmed by the Keeper of the Privy Purse Michael Stevens. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex later announced they would repay Sovereign Grant expenditure, while it is to remain their family home, and the sum was later reported as having been repaid. The couple, who in 2018 had their wedding reception at nearby Frogmore House, moved from Nottingham Cottage to Frogmore Cottage in 2019, before the birth of their first child, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.

He inherited the Lacour‚ÄìDurfort lands in 1345 and abandoned his clerical career to marry Marguerite de Caumont. At first he took the English side in the Hundred Years' War. As a commander, he played a major role in the campaigns of 1345‚Äì46 in the Duchy of Gascony. In 1352 he changed sides, but in 1356 he returned to the English side. Early life and clerical career Born towards 1299, Gaillard was a son of Arnaud (fl. 1306‚Äì21), lord of Clermont and Lacour, and Marqu√®se de Got.L√©on J√©quier (1982), \\"Les armoiries de la maison de Durfort au Moyen √Çge\\", Archivum heraldicum 96 (1‚Äì2): 7‚Äì12. His brothers were Aimeric (fl. 1336‚Äì45), the eldest, lord of Duras; Bertrand (fl. 1322‚Äì60), lord of Gageac; and Raymond- Bernard (fl. 1345‚Äì66), lord of Fenouillet. Gaillard was one of the most successful clerics of his age in accumulating benefices. Through the nepotism of his mother's uncle, Pope Clement V (1305‚Äì14), he received three priories and three canonries with their prebends, as well as the archdeaconries of Orl√©ans and Tours, all before he was either of canonical age or had received holy orders. Clement supplied him with the necessary dispensations, as well as a dispensation from the obligation of residing in his benefices.Jacques Bernard (1949), \\"Le n√©potisme de Cl√©ment V et ses complaisances pour la Gascogne\\", Annales du Midi 61 (7‚Äì8): 369‚Äì411, at 389. In his mature life, Gaillard was a professor of canon law at the University of Toulouse, where he had studied.Jonathan Sumption (1990), The Hundred Years' War, Volume 1: Trial by Battle (London: Faber and Faber), p. 478. He held prebends in Saintes, Agen and York and the archdeaconries of P√©rigueux, Aurillac and Outre-Loire in Angers.Malcolm Graham Allan Vale (1996), The Origins of the Hundred Years War: The Angevin Legacy, 1250‚Äì1340 (Oxford: Clarendon Press), p. 101.Nicole de Pe√±a (1977), Documents sur la maison de Durfort: XIe‚ÄìXVe si√®cle, Part 2 (F√©d√©ration historique du Sud-Ouest), p. 1091. He was also the cantor of Cahors. His uncle, Raymond-Bernard, had served as bishop of P√©rigueux from 1314 to 1331. Gaillard and his brothers used an armorial seal that combined a lion rampant and a bend from two seals first used by their uncle. Gaillard's income from his numerous clerical benefices amounted to some 3,000 livres tournois a year. Pope John XXII, in an effort to remedy the excesses of Clement V's pontificate, forced Gaillard to resign from the archdeaconry of Angers on 8 May 1318.Paul Fournier (1920), \\"Notes compl√©mentaires pour l'histoire des canonistes au XIVe si√®cle, III: Gaillard de Durfort, canoniste et seigneur f√©odal\\", Nouvelle revue historique de droit fran√ßais et √©tranger 44: 516‚Äì524. A single manuscript survives of Gaillard's legal teaching, titled \\"Reports given by the most excellent lord Gaillard of Durfort\\" (Latin Reportationes date per excellentissimum dominum Gualhardum de Duroforti). It contains lessons Gaillard apparently gave at Toulouse in 1337 or 1338 and was compiled either by Gaillard himself or by his students. Topics include the Decretals of Gregory IX and the Enchiridion of Sextus Pomponius. War against France At the outbreak of war between England and France in 1337, his older brother Aimeric sided with the French. This cost Aimeric some lands in the Bordelais, which were confiscated by the English, but he retained his lands in the Agenais and the P√©rigord and he received from King Philip VI some estates confiscated from pro-English barons. Aimeric was probably killed at the battle of Auberoche in October 1345.For the deaths of Aimeric and Gaillard, see Patrice Barnab√© (2001), \\"Guerre et mortalit√© au d√©but de la guerre de Cent Ans: l'exemple des combattants gascons (1337‚Äì1367)\\", Annales du Midi 113 (235): 273‚Äì305, at 298. Aimeric was certainly dead before 26 November 1345. His brother Bernard sided with the English and took part in the Earl of Derby's Bergerac campaign in August 1345.Clifford J. Rogers (2004), \\"The Bergerac Campaign and Henry of Lancaster\\", Journal of Medieval Military History 2: 89‚Äì110. In this situation in November 1345 Gaillard, who had only ever taken minor orders, abandoned the priesthood to become a knight, inherit his brother's lands and marry. Gaillard brought the fortresses of Puyguilhem and Duras to the English, as well as the allegiance of his remaining brothers and their followers. He became lord of Lacour, Duras, Blanquefort, Moissaguel and Villandraut. Gaillard made his formal submission to the Earl of Derby at La R√©ole on 13 November 1345 and in exchange he received back Blanquefort, which the English had seized, and a large cash subsidy. During the Gascon campaign of 1345 and the siege of Aiguillon in 1346, Gaillard held the fortified town of Bajamont against the French. He launched several raids against the provincial capital of Agen, seat of the French. He also launched raids along the stretch of the river Garonne between Moissac and Aiguillon in order to cut off supplies to the besiegers. In response, the seneschal of the Agenais, Robert de Houdetot, laid siege to Bajamont with several hundred men. On 18 July 1346, the Duke of Normandy detached 2,000 of his men from the siege of Auguillon to help the seneschal surround Bajamont with earthworks. Before the project could begin, however, Gaillard ordered a sortie that dealt a serious defeat to the French and captured Houdetot.Nicholas A. Gribit (2016), Henry of Lancaster's Expedition to Aquitaine, 1345‚Äì1346: Military Service and Professionalism in the Hundred Years' War (London: Boydell), pp. 140‚Äì43. Following the relief of the sieges of Aiguillon and Bajamont, the Earl of Derby led a chevauch√©e into French territory in early September 1346. He divided his army into three columns at La R√©ole and Gaillard took command of the column that raided the Agenais.Sumption (1990), p. 541. Having secured the Agenais, Gaillard launched raids into Quercy, reaching as far as Cahors. He took 400 horsemen under his own command and in the last ten days of September raided north into the Corr√®ze, taking the market town of Tulle. This raid sparked panic in the province of Auvergne. News of the capture of Tulle reached Montferrand [ away] on 30 September and the town began immediately to prepare for an attack. The army of Count John of Armagnac was diverted to Tulle, which it besieged from mid-November until late December. The Gascon occupiers surrendered on terms and were taken prisoner, ultimately all were ransomed.Sumption (1990), p. 549, on the siege of Tulle: \\"It was a Pyrrhic vicotry. At an absurdly small cost the Gascons had diverted some thousands of French soldiers to the insignificant town of Tulle, depriving Philip VI of part of his army and dislocating the royal administration in central and southern France for three months.\\" Changes of allegiance On 22 July 1348, Gaillard received from the English treasury the final payment owed him under the convention of November 1345. On 3 May 1352, with the French ascendant in Aquitaine, he switched allegiance, signing a convention with Carlos de la Cerda, constable of France, at Limoges. His brother Bertrand and his relative Bertrand de Goth, lord of Puyguilhem, were also signatories to this agreement, which was approved by King John II of France (formerly the Duke of Normandy) in February 1354. For his allegiance, Gaillard obtained a complete amnesty, the restitution of his lands occupied by French troops and a large subsidy to fund the defence of his castles and compensate him for lost revenues from those estates which he had or would lose to the English. The Caumont, the family of his wife, may have played a role in securing Gaillard's favourable terms. Gaillard changed his allegiance again in 1356, following the great chevauch√©e of Edward the Black Prince in 1355. On 6 April he signed a convention with English similar in terms to the one he signed four years earlier with the French. It was ratified by Edward III at Westminster on 6 July 1358, although by that time Gaillard was dead. Gaillard died between 4 April 1356 and 20 January 1357. He was not at the Battle of Poitiers in September 1356. He was succeeded in his lordships by his son by Marguerite, Gaillard II, who was a minor.

History A Westland Wapiti, one of the first aircraft of the Indian Air Force. On 8 October 1932, the Indian Air Force was established in British India as an auxiliary air force of Royal Air Force, and adopted the Royal Air Force uniforms, badges, brevets and insignia. In 1948, first airstrip was built in Haryana when Ambala Air Force Station was established following the independence of India. After the independence of India in 1947, an air force logistics base was established at Faridabad. The Western Air Command (WAC), of which Raja Nahar Singh Faridabad Air Force Logistics Station is a key component within the National Capital Region, has been the major operational command involved in most of the war fought by India, including the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, Sino-Indian War in 1962, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, Operation Pawan (1986) in Sri Lanka and Operation Safed Sagar during the 1999 Kargil War, and the ongoing air logistics operations to supply troops deployed at Siachen Glacier. Facilities This facility is headed by an Indian Air Force Officer of Group Captain rank from the Air Force Logistics wing. It has a Guard Dog Training Unit and the 56th Air Storage Park. The operations at Commands are supported by the technical and logistics wing at the Command and units level, and logistics wing is responsible for ensuring the supply and storage of spares and consumables.IAF Manual, p.14. Air force logistics is challenging task due to the geographical diversity of weapon system sites and technological diversity of weapon systems and spares, high costs, and high lead times of military aviation equipments.

It closely resembles Myriopteris longipila and was not described as a distinct taxon until 2004. Description While the only specimen known lacks a rhizome, it is believed, from examination of the leaf base, to bear linear to lance-shaped, orange-tan scales. The fronds are long. The stipe (the stalk of the leaf, below the leaf blade) takes up from 40% to 50% of the length of the frond. It is purplish-black in color and round, bearing abundant orange-tan hairs tipped with glands. These are of two different lengths, some 0.1‚Äì0.3 mm and others 1‚Äì1.5 mm. The leaf blades are narrow and slightly widened towards the tip, and tripinnate (cut to pinnae, pinnules, and pinnulets) in the most divided leaves. The pinnae are roughly opposite each other and more or less symmetric about the costa (pinna axis). Their segments are broadly fused. Both surfaces of the pinnae are covered with scattered straight, orange-tan spreading hairs 2 mm in length; unlike the hairs of the stipe, they lack glands. The sporangia occur at the tips of the veins, with 1 to 3 typically covered by the folded edge of a segment lobe. The edges of the leaf are not noticeably differentiated from the bulk of the leaf tissue where they fold over the sporangia. The spores in the sporangia are dark brown in color. Myriopteris maxoniana closely resembles Myriopteris longipila. However, that species tends to be narrowly triangular (widest at the base) to broadly oblong (widest near the tip), and has denser and shorter hairs covering the blade. Taxonomy William Ralph Maxon originally suggested that the type specimen might be a distinct species. However, his suggestion was not taken up until 2004, when John Mickel first described it as Cheilanthes maxoniana, naming it in honor of Maxon. The species is only known from the type specimen, Viereck 76. The development of molecular phylogenetic methods showed that the traditional circumscription of Cheilanthes is polyphyletic. Convergent evolution in arid environments is thought to be responsible for widespread homoplasy in the morphological characters traditionally used to classify it and the segregate genera that have sometimes been recognized. On the basis of molecular evidence, Amanda Grusz and Michael D. Windham revived the genus Myriopteris in 2013 for a group of species formerly placed in Cheilanthes. One of these was C. maxoniana, which thus became Myriopteris maxoniana. In 2018, Maarten J. M. Christenhusz transferred the species to Hemionitis as H. maxoniana, as part of a program to consolidate the cheilanthoid ferns into that genus. Distribution and habitat Myriopteris maxoniana is only known from a single specimen, collected by Leslie Viereck in San Lucas, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Its habitat is not recorded.

He was Mukaththir ibn Isa ibn Fulaytah ibn Qasim ibn Abi Hashim Muhammad, and his nasab (paternal lineage) continues to Hasan ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad. On 2 Sha'ban 570 AH () Mukaththir's father died, and his brother Da'ud became Emir of Mecca. Less than a year later, on the night of 15 Rajab 571 AH (), Mukaththir deposed his brother and assumed the Emirate. On 15 Sha'ban 571 AH () Turanshah, the brother of Saladin, arrived in Mecca on his way to Syria. He summoned Mukaththir and Da'ud and made peace between them. In Dhu al-Hijjah of that year (June 1176) the Iraqi amir al-hajj Tashtakin arrived with orders from the Caliph to depose Mukaththir. Fighting commenced on Yawm al-Nahr ‚Äî 13 Dhu al-Hijjah () ‚Äî and continued until 16 Dhu al-Hijjah (), when Mukaththir finally surrendered his castle on Mount Abu Qubays and left Mecca. Tashtakin gave custodianship of the Emirate to Qasim ibn Muhanna, the Emir of Medina, but he surrendered it to Da'ud after only three days, reportedly out of fear of retaliation from Mukaththir. Reports indicate that by the following year, 572 AH (1176/1177), Mukaththir had once again supplanted Da'ud as Emir. At some point the Emirate returned to Da'ud, as al-Dhahabi reports that he was Emir in 587 AH (1191/1192). He writes that in that year Da'ud looted the Kaaba of its wealth and stripped the Black Stone of its silver collar. When the amir al-hajj arrived he deposed Da'ud and installed Mukaththir once again as Emir. Da'ud died in 589 AH (1193), and Mukaththir reigned without interruption until Qatadah ibn Idris conquered Mecca and ended the reign of the Hawashim. According to varying reports, Qatadah's takeover of Mecca occurred between 597 and 599 AH (between 1200 and 1203). According to Ibn Mahfuz, in 597 AH (1200/1201) Hanzalah ibn Qatadah marched on Mecca and Mukaththir fled to Wadi Nakhlah, where he died in 600 AH (1203/1204).

Description  The fish has a silvery greenish or bluish-grey color above and is paler below. It often has a bronze or a green- gold tinge. The second dorsal and caudal fins are a dusky orange to nearly black. The fins have dark leading edges. The anal fin is a dandelion yellow and the pelvic fins are paler. The pectoral fins are dark.  Taxonomy  In the early 20th century, Australian ichthyologist James Douglas Ogilby was identifying fishes to give advice to fisheries, under supervision of James Stevens, the Queensland Inspector of Fisheries. When the question emerged of what was damaging oyster populations in the Wide Bay district in January 1908, Ogilby determined that the organism to cause this damage was a large fish, yet undescribed to science. He described it as Trachinotus anak in a report in 1909.

She was the first known of four hermits who lived on Brandon Hill at various times between 1314 and 1480.  Life  Little is known about Lucy's life except that she was from Herefordshire and was the first known of a series of hermits who inhabited a cell on Brandon Hill, Bristol, in a chapel owned by St. James Priory. In November 1349, two years before she entered her cell at the hermitage, Lucy obtained an indult from the pope allowing her to \\"choose a confessor who should give her plenary remission at the hour of death.\\" At this time, she was living in the diocese of Hereford, as opposed to the diocese of Worcester where Brandon Hill was then located. After obtaining the papal indult, Lucy petitioned the bishop of Worcester, John of Thoresby, multiple times, to allow her to take up residence as an anchoress in the hermitage and chapel of St. Brendan. The bishop wrote that Lucy had approached him \\"with earnest and humble devotion, as was clear to us from her appearance and demeanour, asking to be enclosed in the hermitage of St. Brandan at Bristol in our diocese.\\" William Barrett, the historian of Bristol, concluded that Lucy's request had been granted after \\"due inquiry into her conduct and purity of life and possession of the necessary virtues.\\" This view was supported by the antiquarian Rotha Mary Clay, who described the bishop as being \\"impressed by Lucy's earnestness\\" and who identified Lucy as probably the same individual described in a deed from 1351 as an anchoress who held land on Brandon Hill. The ritual of enclosure and Lucy's blessing may have been carried out by John de Severle, the archdeacon of Worcester, or a \\"deputy\\" of his choosing, as the bishop had written to him, bestowing the power to perform it. In the 15th century, the antiquarian William Worcester described the chapel that had contained Lucy's hermitage as being 8 and a half yards long and 5 yards wide and \\"like in form to Mount Calvary by Jerusalem.\\" Worcester also claimed it was the highest structure in Bristol, having been erected on a hill that \\"\\"  Later references to Lucy  Various Bristol histories and guide books of the 19th and early 20th centuries have included ironic references to Lucy and have speculated about her desire to become an anchoress, attributing it to a \\"satiety\\" or \\"disappointment with the world.\\" One guide book written \\"for strangers\\" on the \\"curiosities of Bristol\\" described Lucy as the first of a series of hermits who had \\"wasted their lives [in the hermitage], down to the days of the Reformation.\\" In 1885, a poem appeared in the antiquarian James Fawckner Nicholls' guide book How To See Bristol mocking Lucy's decision to enclose herself in a cell rather than engage in domestic work, child care, or moral reform efforts. The poem, which follows a description of Brandon Hill, reads as follows: > Lucy de Newchurch here sat in her cell A patching her soul, and stopping > each hole That the world or the devil could enter. 'Twas well For a woman > that knew no better. But she'd dout the sun with a half-penny squirt, Or mop > up the sea with the tail of her skirt, Convince all maids that 'twas wicked > to marry, Before she could outmanoeuvre Old Harry, Or before he alone would > let her. Had she handled a broom in some humble room, Or crooned babe's > \\"Babel\\" while rocking her cradle, Or scalded her hand with the iron ladle > Whilst giving soup to some hungry group; Or sopped a crust for some > toothless gum, Or kissed the blood from a child's cut thumb, Or said to some > fallen sister, 'O come! This way of life abandon!' She'd have been much > nearer to kingdom come, Than here by herself on Brandon.  Excavations on Brandon Hill  In 1897, Dr. Alfred C. Fryer, a member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, published a paper in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association on the discovery of buried walls, bones, and a \\"well-made,\\" east‚Äìwest‚Äìoriented grave during excavations for the foundations of Cabot Tower. According to James R. Bramble, the president of the club, Dr. Fryer believed the \\"walls found several feet below the surface of the summit of the hill to have been remains of a 'crypt belonging to the Chapel of St. Brandon,' and that the skeletons were those of 'some of the poor hermits who once occupied the hermitage.'\\" Alfred Hudd, the club's secretary, who visited the site, believed the walls were more likely to be those of the hermitage chapel itself rather than a crypt.

Anatolia/Asia Minor in the Greco-Roman period. The classical regions, including Lycia, and their main settlements Perikles (Perikle in Lycian), was the last known dynast of Lycia. He ruled BCE over eastern Lycia from Limyra, at a time when Western Lycia was directly under Persian domination. Rule He was a victor over his predecessor ArttumÃÉpara (Aetembares). Perikles took an active part in the Revolt of the Satraps against Achaemenid power, but lost his territory when defeated. After Perikles, Persian rule was reestablished firmly in Lycia in 366 or 362 BCE. Control was taken by Mausolus, the satrap of nearby Caria, who moved the satrap's residence to Halicarnassus.

It is 11 km from Sonipat Junction railway station, 45 km from Maharana Pratap Inter State Bus Terminus at Kashmiri Gate, Delhi, and 190 km from Chandigarh on NH1 Grand Trunk Road.  Etymology  Kumashpur was known as \\"Kammasadamma\\" in pali language Buddhist texts and the \\"Kamas Nigam\\" in Sanskrit texts, which later came to be known as \\"Kamas Dham\\", and finally in its present corrupted form as \\"Kumashpura\\" which has been shortened to \\"Kumashpur\\". History During vedic era, it was part of Kuru Kingdom of Mahabharata. In 545 BCE, Lord Buddha visited \\"Kammasadamma\\" as mentioned in the PƒÅli Canon of Theravada Buddhism. At the time of Buddha's visit, Kumashpur use to be a trading hub. He chose this place to give his famed discourse called Mahasatipatthana sutta. Buddha said he chose this place for \\"Mahasatipatthana\\" because it was the land of virtuous and moral Kuru people who practiced sila (five core tenets of Buddhism), hence they were more suited to receive and grasp the details of \\"Mahasatipatthana sutta\\". Since people of Kuru kingdowm were moral people who were already following \\"sila\\", Buddha did not include the learning of \\"sila\\" in \\"Mahasatipatthana sutta\\" discourse. \\"Mahasatipatthana sutta\\", which means \\"The Great Discourse on the Establishing of Mindfulness\\", stresses the practice of sati (mindfulness) for realization of nirvana, and this sutta later became the foundation for vipassanƒÅ yoga meditation.Vipassana Research Institute, 1996, pp. 2, 3. In 1997-98 from the ancient Pali Tharaveda Buddhist texts, Satya Narayan Goenka traced the association of Kumashpura with the Kammasadamma and Lord Buddha's \\"Mahasatipatthana sutta\\" discourse at this place. He build a pagoda and vipassana meditation centre here. Goenka, a sanatani Hindu born in Burma to Marwari Indian parents, learnt vipassana from Sayagyi U Ba Khin and became a vipassana teacher and founder of meditation centres in India, Thailand and other nations. For his services to the society, Goenka was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2012 by the government of India.
