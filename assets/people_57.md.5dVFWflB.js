A quartz reef at Steiglitz was originally named after Otway, but was later renamed as the Copenhagen. Otway's Alpha Silver Mining Company, formed in 1861, was the second mining company at St Arnaud and the first to attempt to specifically mine for silver. After considerable investment in leases and equipment, the mine was acknowledged as a failure by 1863, and the assets sold off in 1864.Birrell, Ralph Winter (2008).

Elaine Gordon (1931 - February 25, 2000) was an American politician. She served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1972 to 1994 as a Democrat. She was born in The Bronx, New York and moved to Florida in 1964. During the constitutional revision session for the state in 1968, she was legislative assistant to George Firestone.

Gordon served as Speaker Pro-Tempore (acting speaker) for the state assembly. In 1992, she was named Dean of the Florida House. She retired from the Florida legislature in 1994. She worked on the unsuccessful ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment in Florida; although the amendment passed in the House of Representatives several times, it was defeated in the Florida Senate. After her divorce, Gordon was unable to get a credit card in her name since she was a women.

Top Michigan news stories Newspaper editors and broadcast news directors voted on the top news stories in Michigan for 1994 as follows: # Republican election victories. November 8 election in which John Engler was reelected to a second term as Governor and Spencer Abraham was elected U.S. Senator. In the Michigan gubernatorial election, 1994, Engler defeated Democrat Howard Wolpe by a margin of 61.5% to 38.5%. In the United States Senate election in Michigan, 1994, Abraham defeated Democrat Bob Carr by a margin of 52% to 43% with Libertarian Jon Coon receiving 4% of the votes. # Proposal A tax reform. On March 15, voters approved Proposal A by 65% to 35%. The proposal shifted funding for schools from property taxes to sales taxes. The proposal raised the state's sales tax from 4% to 6% and increased the tax on cigarettes by 50 cents. # Jack Kevorkian and assisted suicide. On May 2, a jury acquitted Jack Kevorkian in connection with the death of Thomas Hyde who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease. The trial was the first test of Michigan's assisted suicide law, adopted by the Legislature to stop Kevorkian from continuing his efforts to assist terminally ill patients to end their lives. After the verdict, Kevorkian told reporters: \\"I'm prosecutable. I'm just not convictable.\\" Days later, on May 10, a Michigan appellate court issued separate rulings that (i) persons assisting suicide could be prosecuted for murder, and (ii) Michigan's assisted suicide law was technically invalid but that a revised ban would be constitutional. # Growth in the Michigan economy. # Charter schools. A judge ruled charter schools unconstitutional, and the Legislature then acted to authorize and fund them. # Booming auto sales. # Deep winter freeze. Severe cold weather struck the state in January. # Detroit prison break. On August 21, 10 prisoners escaped from the Ryan Regional Correctional Facility in Detroit. Nine of the escapees were captured. The tenth was found dead. # Day-care/child custody decision. On July 8, a 69-year-old Macomb County judge ordered that custody of three-year-old Maranda Ireland-Smith be removed from her 19-year-old mother and instead be awarded to the father. The judge found that the mother's use of commercial day care while attending classes at the University of Michigan was not in the child's best interest, whereas the father's mother was willing to care for the child full time. The decision drew national attention and criticism from working parents. The New York Times wrote that the order was \\"an affront and threat to the millions of women for whom day care is the difference between ignorance and an education, poverty and a decent income, dependency and self- reliance.\\" The decision was reversed on appeal in 1995. # Deckerville child abuse trial. Stephen Rogers of Deckerville and his live-in girlfriend, Trudy O'Connor, were convicted of first-degree child abuse after Rogers' nine-year- old daughter was found by police in February 1994 chained to urine-soaked bed in dark closet. Rogers was sentenced to 10‚Äì15 years in prison, and O'Connor was sentenced to a six-to-15 year term. In separate balloting by Michigan Associated Press newspapers and broadcast stations, the state's top sports stories were selected as follows: # Nancy Kerrigan assault. On January 6, an assailant hired by the ex-husband of Tonya Harding struck Nancy Kerrigan's right knee with a club as she walked through a corridor at Detroit's Cobo Arena following a practice session at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Kerrigan was treated for her injuries at Hutzel Hospital. # Firing of George Perles. On November 8, after the 1994 Michigan State Spartans football team began the season with nine losses and no wins, George Perles was fired as the team's head coach. He had been head coach for 12 years and was the second winningest coach in program history. Nick Saban was hired as his replacement on December 3. # Baseball strike. On September 14, the 1994‚Äì95 Major League Baseball strike began. The strike resulted in the cancellation of the final weeks of the season as well as the World Series. # World Cup in Michigan. The 1994 FIFA World Cup had several games played at the Pontiac Silverdome, including a 1-1 tie between USA and Switzerland. # Isiah Thomas. Isiah Thomas was offered a $55 million contract with the Pistons but took a post with Toronto instead. #Detroit Red Wings lost in first round of playoffs and Bryan Murray fired as GM. # The 1994‚Äì95 NHL lockout. # Grant Hill signed. The Pistons selected Grant Hill with the third overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft. # The 1993 Michigan Wolverines football team, including Colorado's victory in the Miracle at Michigan. # Scott Mitchell signed. After losing Erik Kramer to free agency, the Detroit Lions on March 7 signed free agent quarterback Scott Mitchell to an $11 million contract, including a $5 million signing bonus.

Morthenson (born April 7, 1940 in √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik, Sweden) is a prominent Swedish composer, critic, and writer primarily known for his criticism of music in Sweden and his compositional styles of non-figurative music, music that aimed to avoid any relationship to past compositional techniques, and meta-music, which alluded to historical music genres in order to criticize them. Morthenson's success as a composer and intellect in Sweden is reflected by the influential positions he has held throughout his career. He was on the board for the Electronic Music Studio from 1973-1975, he acted as chairman of the Swedish section of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ICSM) from 1974-1975, he was vice-chairman of the ISCM council from 1975-1978, and he was also the chairman for Fylkingen, a Swedish chamber music society that focuses primarily on new music, from 1975-1976.Broman 2002, pg. 473-474Haglund 2001  Training  Morthenson began studying music in Stockholm in 1956 with Runar Mangs, a prominent Swedish music critic. Mangs left a lasting impression on young Morthenson, who would later refer to him in an obituary as one of the most important contemporary music critics in Sweden.Tjernberg 2007, pg. 5 Four years after Morthenson began working with Mangs, he went on to study privately with Ingvar Lindholm in 1960, and premiered his first public work, Wechselspeil I (1960) for solo cello.Tjernberg 2007, pg. 6 The significance of Wechselspeil I was perpetuated by Morthenson's status as a young member of Fylkingen, which he joined in the same year.Tjernberg 2007, pg. 12 Following his time with Lindholm, Morthenson attended Uppsala University to study aesthetics and furthered his study as a composer through private lessons with Gottfried Michael K√∂enig at the electronic music studio in Cologne.Tjernberg 2007, pg. 7 He also studied with Heinz-Klaus Metzger, who would write a long preface to Morthenson's only book Non-figurative Musik in 1966.Broman 2002, pg. 480 Career= 1960s: Early style and philosophy = Morthenson made a name for himself as a prominent young composer and intellectual in the 1960s. He became highly active in the Swedish musical community, composing orchestral, vocal, chamber, and tape pieces, and writing numerous academic articles in the Swedish journal Nutida Musik. Fueled by his belief that traditional compositional techniques had been exhausted and future composers would need to create something brand new in order to progress their art, Morthenson's main focus and contribution in the 60s was his non-figurative music. Beginning in 1962 with Coloratura III (1962-63), Morthenson's non- figurative period was characterized by the avoidance of all traditional musical gestures, tools, and goals, resulting in a focus on timbre and density of sound, using these as compositional building blocks. One of Morthenson's preferred instruments for non-figurative music is the organ, probably because of his relationship with organist Karl Erik Welin. He states in an interview with Bj√∂rn Gottstein on August 2008 that composing for organ, a medium that he preferred for his non-figurative music, and his work with Welin was a doorway into the world of electronic music,Gottstein 2008, August Interview and in 1967 he composed the first Swedish computer-assisted work Neutron Star (1967) in collaboration with G√∂ran Sundqvist.Broman 2002, pg. 554 Morthenson developed a close relationship Welin and consequentially wrote numerous pieces for organ, which Welin played around the world, including: Some of These (1961), Encores (1964), Eternes (1965), Decadenza I (1968), and Farewell (1970). Among these, Decadenza I, and Farwell were the first examples of Morthenson's meta-music, or music about music, which became his prominent style during the 1970s.Tjernberg 2007, pg. 43Randel 1996 = 1970s: Meta-music = In the 1970s, following his non-figurative music period, Morthenson continued to criticize music from another perspective, developing a new style of composition for which he coined the term meta-music. Like his non- figurative music, meta-music stemmed from Morthenson's pessimistic view of musical development, but rather than avoiding any allusion to historical reference in his new style, Morthenson began to use past genres in order to criticize them. For example, in the string quartet Ancora (1983)‚Äìhis only piece to feature direct quotes, which come from Balkan, Greek, and Turkish folk songs‚ÄìMorthenson begins with a peaceful Dodecanese folk tune in the cello. As the piece progresses, it becomes increasingly more intense and modernistic, representing Morthenson's belief that folk and avant-garde music probably cannot exist simultaneously for much longer. His other meta-music works deliver similar commentary related to his critical view of the development of music. A non-exhaustive list of these pieces includes Decadenze I, Farwell, Senza (1970), Collosus (1970), Labor (1971), and Alla Marcia (1974), criticizing church music, requiems, string repertoire, orchestral works, virtuoso solos, and militaristic genres, respectively. = 1980s to present day = The final style that Morthenson adhered to in his music and writings is what he refers to as existentialist music. Feeling that his career was reaching an end, he wrote Epilogos (2008), which represents his work as a composer and also commemorates the death of his wife. In an interview with Bj√∂rn Gottstein in February 2008, Morthenson reflected on his career, stating: ‚ÄúI have worked with three major aspects of music in my life. First of all, what I call non-figurative music... And then I worked with what I called meta- music, music about music. And this last stage I work with what I call existentialist music. And that is a music without any specific meaning. Without any specific goal. And without any specific technique or will to get to something, some result of any kind. It is just like life, I think. You walk around and look at things and you wonder what they are and what their meaning is, and you don't always find out.‚ÄùGottstein 2008, February Interview  Notes  References  *Broman, Per F.

It is operated as a not-for- profit company limited by guarantee was authorised by the then responsible minister, Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Hon Kelly O'Dwyer MP in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). AFCA replaced the three pre- existing EDR schemes of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) and Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT). Membership of AFCA is a requirement under law or license condition of all financial firms and financial service providers. AFCA is led by the Chief Ombudsman and CEO, presently David Locke.  History  The Australian Financial Complaints Authority was established on 1 November 2018, replacing the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) and Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT). The Australian Government announced on 9 May 2017 AFCA would be established in response to the review of external dispute resolution and complaints arrangements in the financial system.  Operations and processes = Rules = The Rules of AFCA outline the types of complaints that AFCA can consider, as well as their procedures, remedies and reporting obligations. The Rules were approved by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on 12 September 2018. = Resolution process = The AFCA only considers a complaint after the consumer has first attempted to resolve the dispute directly with their financial service provider. If the dispute is unable to be resolved or the outcome is unsatisfactory, AFCA can then consider it. Complaints can be filed with AFCA through an online form on their website. An AFCA representative will then contact the consumer and relevant financial service provider to settle the dispute. In the case a settlement cannot be reached, an AFCA case analyst will develop a balanced solution. The consumer can then either accept the proposed settlement from AFCA or take their dispute to court. = Governance = The Australian Financial Complaints Authority is governed by a Board of Directors, which includes equal numbers of industry and consumer representatives. The Independent Chair of the Board is Helen Coonan. The Board appoints an independent Chief Ombudsman and CEO, presently David Locke.

After seeing a 2D game engine created by PopCap programmer Brian Rothstein, Sidhu was able to realize his game, and worked with Rothstein for the first five months of its development before bringing in additional programmers. Initial designs focused on bringing together elements of pachinko with Breakout. The team initially incorporated a \\"rapid-fire\\" mechanic used in pachinko, along with numerous moving targets, but they found this made the levels either too fast-paced or too demanding of the player. They found over time that a static field of pegs provided a more enjoyable experience for the player; the path of the ball would be more predictable, leading to the gameplay mechanic of requiring only a random subset of orange pegs to be cleared. Once the team had established the core mechanics of the game, they brought on character artist Walter Wilson, background artist Marcia Broderick and an additional coder, Eric Tams, to help complete Peggle within its two- year development period. Even with their game established, Sidhu and Rothstein faced internal challenges at PopCap to increase the level of interactivity with the game, but the two defended their vision of the game.

She was called the \\"Florence Nightingale of Hawaii.\\"  Early life  Kanazawa was the first of eleven children born to Torazo and Saki Ryusaki. She grew up on her family's farm in Kamuela, Hawaii. In addition to growing vegetables, the farm also raised pigs and chickens, and made products such as tofu and okolehao, or Hawaiian moonshine. After graduating from Hilo High School, Kanazawa worked as a stenographer for the Department of Public Instruction, and was then promoted to the Vocational Division of the Department in Honolulu. Afterwards, she became Secretary and Acting Principal at Kohala Elementary and High School.  World War II  After the onset of World War II, the Japanese Consulate in Hawaii was closed and its duties were taken over by the Swedish Consulate. Gustaf Olson, the Vice Consul of Sweden, hired Kanazawa as an Executive Vice Secretary to mediate between the military government and the Japanese community in Hawaii. Kanazawa not only performed official duties such as inspecting ships with Japanese prisoners of war to ensure humane treatment in accordance with international law, but performed many unofficial duties such as assisting wives of interned husbands in finding jobs, purchasing food and clothing for families in need, and accompanying families to internment camps to visit their sons and fathers. Many nicknamed her the \\"Florence Nightingale of Hawaii\\" due to her actions. After the end of the war, she was awarded the American Red Cross for her humanitarian services.  Post-war  After the war, Kanazawa met Kinji Kanazawa, who would shortly become her husband. After the two married they moved to Boston, where Kinji enrolled in the law program at Boston College and Kanazawa enrolled in the Chamberlain School of Retailing. Afterwards, the couple and their two children moved back to Hawaii. In addition to raising her family, Kanazawa continued her work in helping the less fortunate and vulnerable. She served on many boards and commissions, including the Commission on Children and Youth which established the foundations of Hawaii's Family Court, the Commission on Aging, the Planned Giving for Campaign 2000, the Faith in Action National Advisory Committee, the Hawaii Summit 2011 Project, and the White House Conference on Aging.

It begins in the east, at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. It links York Place with the Moray Estate. It was named \\"Queen Street\\" after Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the wife of George III of the United Kingdom and was so named on James Craig's plan of the New Town issued by the Town Council in 1768. Most early maps repeat this name but others misname it Queen's Street or Queens Street. When Leith amalgamated with Edinburgh in 1920, the city gained a second Queen Street. This was renamed Shore Place in 1966. History The street forms part of James Craig's plan of 1768 for a New Town, outwith the walls of Edinburgh's Old Town. This had three main east-west streets: Princes Street; George Street; and Queen Street. Queen Street was planned as a one-sided street, facing north over then fields towards the Firth of Forth. The first 30 metres beyond the road itself was originally laid out as private individual gardens to some of the Queen Street residents.John ainslie's plan of Edinburgh 1804 Not until the opposite side was developed was there pressure to combine these gardens as a communal (but private) garden serving both Queen Street to the north and Heriot Row and Abercromby Place to the south. From 1840 this was known as Queen Street Gardens.New Town Gardens, The, Queen Street Gardens, Edinburgh, Scotland, accessed 16 November 2018 The street is planned as four terraces of equal length, originally all three storey and basement in form.

Feuing continued piecemeal and was complete by 1792.The Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh, by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker The skew on the final two blocks at the west end (leading to North Charlotte Street and from there to Charlotte Square) result from an unresolved feuing argument with Lord Moray, who later built the Moray Estate on the land west of Queen Street.

Dilworth (born 1970) is an American choral composer, arranger, conductor, and music educator from St. Louis, Missouri.  Education  Early education Dilworth, as a young boy, was impassioned by singing experiences in his school and church choirs. At the age of 11, he began experimenting with the music he was given by testing out alternate pitches and rhythms. His elementary music teacher fostered this curiosity by realizing his work. This period marked the beginning of his love for arranging music. At this time, he also began studying music theory and piano. During his high school years, he quickly discovered that he wanted to pursue music as a career. Higher education To fulfill his ambitions, Dilworth continued his education at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio. There, he continued his study of voice and piano and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Music Education. He spent a year teaching elementary school music full-time while also attending the University of Missouri-St. Louis to complete a master's degree in secondary education. Throughout the program, Dilworth's long-time musical idol, Robert Ray, taught him composition and arranging skills. After completing the master's degree in 1994, Dilworth spent another year teaching elementary music. He then continued on to receive a DMA in conducting, this time studying with Robert Harris.  Career  Dilworth served as the director of the music education and choral programs at North Park University in Chicago, Illinois from 1996 to 2009. In 1998, both Colla Voce and Hal Leonard contacted Dilworth, offering him publishing contracts. Since then, Dilworth has had over 150 works published. He has contributed to the Choir Builders series of choral textbooks and to the music magazine Music Express, both of which are published by Hal Leonard. In 2003, he was the recipient of North Park University's Zenos Hawkinson Award for Teaching Excellence and Campus Leadership. After 2009, Dilworth accepted a position as a professor of music at Temple University in Pennsylvania. He is the chair of the Music Education and Music Therapy department there. In 2017, he was honored with the Temple University Faculty Award for Research and Creative Achievement. Dilworth has, through his compositional and educational endeavors, become an active participant in the domestic and international worlds of music. Style and influence Both classical music and African-American folk music have influenced Dilworth's musical development and style. He recognizes Beethoven and Chopin as beloved classical icons in his life, but his compositional style is largely influenced by Gospel and Spiritual composers such as Robert Ray and Moses Hogan. Dilworth also draws inspiration from African-American literary tradition. He has a particular affinity for the poetry of Langston Hughes and Paul Lawrence Dunbar, a love which has moved him to compose settings of their texts.

Some of the first telephone-based ride-matching programs were Bellevue Smart Traveler from the University of Washington, Los Angeles Smart Traveler from Los Angeles's Commuter Transportation Services, and Rideshare Express from Sacramento Rideshare. However, in these telephone-based programs the operational costs started exceeding their revenues and an alternative, internet and email driven ride-matches, was proposed. This program was tested on a closed campus, and it was only available to University of Washington related people, which proved highly successful. Two other programs, ATHENA and MINERVA were both computerized but faced unsuccessful endings. When the internet was created in the 1990s, online ride-matching was created. Websites originally had lists or forums that people could get information for carpooling options from, but the internet provided the ability to develop platforms, which were more dynamic and interactive. This concept didn't take off because the mechanics were not any different than traditional carpooling, only the ability to find them had been made easier. Since carpooling and ride- sharing were not a very popular option, the smaller population who did participate already had set agendas so timing wise it was not helpful to those who needed transportation outside of a regular workday commute. Larger scale companies started becoming interested in partnering with ride-matching companies in order to spread the ride-sharing platform which are gaining more traction as availability of mobile technology and thus accessibility not from a stationary point is becoming more prominent.  User input/privacy with software data = Software = User Input Features  Ride-sharing applications have several common user input features: * Users can input their pick-up destination. * Users can input their drop-off destination. * Users can save a home or work address. * Users can save unique places if they are visited frequently. * Users can also pinpoint their exact location on a map. * Users can save their credit card information for easy access. * Users can invite their friends which the app pulls from their phone contact information. * Users can create their own profile. * Users can see the profiles of their potential drivers as well as any reviews that come with it. Ride-sharing companies also have several tracking features that are unclear in terms of what user information is being collected: * The application automatically connects and tracks the user's current location and surrounding areas, so when the app opens, an accurate map is immediately opened as the home page and the location of the user are immediately tracked. * Recent addresses that have been set as either pick-up or drop-off locations are in kept in the search history. * Letting the app connect to personal data that is stored in the phone, such as access to contacts, can let the app access more than just phone numbers (addresses, personal information) which have been stored under the contact in the phone.  Uber Privacy  Uber has an option where user privacy can potentially be forgotten and they are aware of what data they are collecting from the user and are being transparent: * Ability to share or un- share live location as well as having location settings always on. * Ability to receive notifications about your account and trip. * Ability to remove stored contacts which adds on another way that can link two people together if someone is tracking someone's information. * Ability to share trip details with 911 in case of emergency. * Ability to sync personal calendar with the app.  Lyft Privacy  According to Lyft's Privacy Policy, the information they collect includes: * Registration information provided to them (name, email, phone number) * If a social media account is used to register, information from that profile will be used (name, gender, profile picture, friends) * Any information the user chooses to put in the profile * Payment information to charge riders (although credit card information is not stored by them) * Any interactions with the support team * Information provided during the driver application (DOB, address, Social Security, license information etc.) * Payment information to pay drivers * Location information including saved locations * Information about the device that the app's being used on * Usage data * Calls and Texts between riders and drivers * Feedback * Contacts (if user permits it) * Cookies = Hardware = Camera inside the car  Very recently has the presence of physical cameras been implemented in ride-share vehicles. Prior to this, the only time cameras were related to cars were traffic cameras and police cars. However, there has been a rise in the amount of continuous-recording cameras that are not just surveilling the road and keeping track of what happens outside the car. The implementation of cameras inside cars to record interactions between drivers and riders is something new. However, people are concerned about their privacy because this recording goes on during their trip duration, and they do not verbally consent to their recording. However, they consent to being in a person's car, hence they must abide to the driver's rules. There are federal rules about audio recordings, federal laws only requires \\"one party consent\\".  Government policies about recording  According to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, there are policies regarding recording audio conversations, including clarifications about the \\"one-party consent\\" rule that comes with it. Regarding audio conversations, it is illegal to record a conversation for which one is not partaking in. However, they are allowed to record if they are a member of the conversation themselves, without having to receive consent from the other party or having to let them know there is recording happening. *  Concerns = The potential abuse of location-tracking = There are several areas where data could potentially be abused by the application knowing the rider's location. Since trip data is collected, if the ride-sharing company has partnerships with corporations, their partners can use the data to predict future locations and be able to pinpoint an individual's interests and market towards them. Corporations can collect information on what types of stores and what brands are most often visited by a user and can build an online profile, which is traceable. This can also relate to advertising companies, which can target personal interests and alter their online interactions to start showing ads that are catered and specific towards where the user has visited. *citation* There are some cases where bad implications could arise. If the user were to partake in something related to their political standpoints, companies can store this for later information and potentially use it against the user if they come into contact with the company in a professional setting. This can apply to medicinal, religious, or legal affiliations as well, that a user's location and places visited cannot be justified when being looked at from an outside perspective. Relating more to the online profile created of the user, if a person solely relies on ride-sharing services to get around, one can track how long the user has been away from their home and how far away they are from their home. This becomes an opportunity for people to stalk or rob the user because they know when is the ideal time people aren't home. *citation* Looking on a broader scale, based on the demographics of the area a user interacts with, if they frequently visit the same stores within a certain area, information can be assumed, such as estimated income. *citation* Users have the option to save a home or work address for easy access. Most often, users put their actual address, but in some cases, users have been known to put an address a couple streets away, just for their safety in case data gets leaked. However, while this is a very basic level of deflection, putting a home address a couple streets away still gives a general location of where the user is stationed. = Location aware applications = Individuals have concerns over how, what, when, and where their location information is being stored as well as to what extent others have access to it. Not only pertaining to ride-sharing applications, but any applications that have sharing enabled of sorts, there are several types of applications that are location aware. Location based searching (LBS) occurs when a user's tracking returns items and buildings around the user's current location in order to be tracked. A map is drawn with the orientation of the surrounding buildings to determine a location. Geo- location services are having the user tracked with an environmental footprint. It's an estimate of a user's location. Mobile sensing is the process of pinpointing the user's physical device, which has sensors and information that can be collected. Location sharing is a voluntary state where the user is in live-time and their location is constantly being updated and tracked. = Making use of user information = Looking more at the applications and how a user accesses the ride-sharing service, once a user inputs data into the app, it will be accessible on the web forever. Even if they delete information or delete their account, the information has been created on an online platform and now exists whether the user consents to it or not. These applications ask for user information such as phone number, email, and profile picture, all features which can be used to trace back to the user's identity. Once this information is in the application's database, it can accessed by the application as well as indirectly by any partners of the app. Most apps have the payment charged and completed before a user can be connected to their ride. Users have the option to store credit card information for easy access instead of having to repeatedly input payment information. While there is an added level of security, such as passcode or touch ID before every transaction, this does not ensure the safety of this information in the app. It only ensures that the current transaction is made under the consent of the user. = Reverse image search = Users are allowed to input a profile picture into their applications. Doing so has the intention of helping drivers spot their intended riders. However, this can cause an issue because if somehow a rider's image is saved and uploaded to the web, connections can be made to personal accounts. For example, with Facebook's face recognition advanced algorithm, it is easier to identify people's identities from outside pictures.  Solutions = Noise distribution = Researchers have come up with a conclusion which introduces a solution for these issues which is a system that helps with both data privacy and user anonymity. The solution is a program that creates a noise distribution so a user's certain location is offset. It is basically putting the location of the user through some encryption and reporting that location that only the system knows how to read, so it is not manipulating the actual location, but just how that data is input into the system. This solution has already been implemented into two major operating systems, Mac OS and Linux. This solution helps with those who are suspicious of using these ride-sharing applications because of the fear of their privacy being invaded or potentially data being stolen, but this software has proven that it can handle securing data as well as keeping the user anonymous. It is more like an extra layer of security that creates another blanket to hide the user.  K-anonymity  K-anonymity serves as an Anonymizing Server, which is a trusted third party server which is in charge of providing anonymous cover for users. K-anonymity is used to preserve the location privacy by creating a location cloak without knowing the actual location of the user. The software attempts to find a number of users close to the actual users because then exact locations could not be correlated back to the original user in question and these several locations which cannot be identified to the users in close proximity would protect the original user. There is no way to distinguish between all the users. = Fuzzy interference systems = Another solution is to try and use fuzzy interference systems when relating to mobile geo-services. This solution would use different details to identify the user that would not be prone to organizations abusing the obtained information. Currently, location based services can reveal several sensitive pieces of information, like closest religious institutions, which can reveal the identity of the user, which organizations utilize for purely commercial purposes. The paper proposes a solution, anonymization, which protects user's data in case of accidental breaches. There is an explanation of the fuzzy inference system and how it works *explain how it works* and then the potential implication method in taxi drivers to see if this is an effective way of protecting people's information because there isn't a concrete design with anonymization that has proven to do well. There are different levels of precision that the location system can narrow down on a user. These systems turn quantitative data into qualitative data which would obscure a user's identity and location. After a trial implementation with taxi drivers, several complications came up, mostly human misinterpretation, but in the future, investing more time into this solution and combining it with already existing solutions could provide a more effective solution. To those who are afraid of their locations being tracked and that being used to trace back to the user, this solution makes user data fuzzy so if they are being tracking, it is not completely precise. There are data tables that show experimental distances of how close a tracking software was to those who had implemented the fuzzy solution. This solution takes on a different approach because it doesn't entirely solve the problem of how to entirely protect the user's privacy, but it is working towards it since the solution has not had enough time to mature, as it is just in introductory stages. It sheds light on the fact that the location tracking software is still not private even when solutions have been taken to try and overcome this solution but leaves an open ending because it ends that with more research and resources put into it (and specifically told what areas could be developed better) it could expand further and be developed better. = Location transformation = One proposed solution is a model that would estimate how difficult it would be for outside sources to get their hands on someone's private information. There are several mechanisms proposed that would be helpful in hiding data including location obfuscation, perturbation, confusion and suppression, and cryptographic techniques.  Location obfuscation  Obfuscating a user's location means to cloud the user's location. A user's location coordinates are still being preserved, however the accuracy is just being degraded. However, this cannot be a complete solution because this would just neglect the entire reason of location-based services. So being selective in what an application is obfuscating, would help with protection. There is a program, called NRand algorithm, which is the algorithm that determines the amount of obstruction that is put on the user location data. There are a couple issues that arise with this algorithm, including determining how much noise should be implemented and if the changing of the data is enough to alter it to an unrecognizable form from its original state.  Location perturbation  On a map, a location locks onto something in close proximity but not the exact user location because of added noise. With this added layer, if there is another location in a close enough range, a transition will be added to multiple locations and mask all points of interest.  Confusion and suppression  A dummy location is set as the true location. This is done so by pinpointing a user's specific location and transforming it into several other locations, yet keeping the true location. Suppression is a subset of these different applications where for a short period of time, when a user enters an area, the user information is temporarily suspended and the identity of the user is lost, so when they exit back out of the protected area, they have a new identity.  Cryptographic techniques  Original data is unable to be tracked because information goes through some sort of cryptographic interpreter, could be transformed into several different data points.

Education Ren√© Groebli grew up in the Enge district of the city of Zurich, where he attended the Langzeitgymnasium. After two years, he moved to the Oberrealschule, a science-oriented grammar school, but broke off this education after two years to begin an apprenticeship as a photographer with Theo Vonow in Zurich in 1944. When his teacher moved back to Graub√ºnden, Groebli entered the preparatory course of the Zurich School of Applied Arts, attending from the spring of 1945. Subsequently, he enrolled in the renowned professional class for photography under the direction of Hans FinslerRen√© Groebli at FotoCH, online reference for Swiss photography and Alfred Willimann until the summer of 1946. Amongst his fellow students were Ernst Scheidegger and Anita Nietz. In September 1946 Groebli began training as a documentary cameraman at Central Film and Gloria Film Z√ºrich, graduating in late 1948 with a diploma, though he did not subsequently practice as a cinematographer.S√ºtterlin, Georg: Groebli, Ren√©, in: Fotostiftung Schweiz, Index der Fotografinnen In 1947 he won third prize in a competition run by the monthly magazine Camera with his series Karussell. Freelancing for Victor-N. Cohen agency in Zurich, in 1948 Groebli made his first trip to Paris and in 1949 bought his first Leica. Photojournalism From 1949 Groebli worked as a photojournalist and carried out assignments for the Z√ºri-Woche, and later in Africa and the Middle East for the London agency Black Star. The pictures were published in the magazines Life and Picture Post. His first small folio Magie der Schiene ('Rail magic') comprising 16 photographs (with front and back cover) was also shot in 1949 and self-published later the same year.Gasser, M. (1998). From National Defence to human expression: Swiss photography 1939‚Äì49. History of Photography, 22(3), 229-236. It captures the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô of steam train travel during the late 1940s. Despite being young and relatively unknown, Groebli was able to borrow enough money to finance the high-quality printing. Technically it is a portfolio rather than a book, with pages unbound and laid in loose, inspired by the Man Ray and Paul √âluard publication FACILE (1935) which he purchased on his first trip to Paris in 1948. Photographed with a Rolleiflex 6√ó6 and a Leica 35mm camera in and around Paris, as well as locations in Switzerland, the often motion-blurred and grainy images convey the energy of steam. An obi-band with German text was produced for the approximately 30 to 40 original preorders, and other copies sold without. He held his first solo exhibition with photographs from the book. He spent three months in Paris where he met Brassa√Ø and Robert Frank and spent a month in London. On October 13, 1951 he and Rita D√ºrm√ºller (1923-2013) were married. A second slim picture book Das Auge der Liebe, self-published in 1954 through his business ‚ÄúTurnus‚Äù, was created in collaboration with his wife Rita Groebli who had successfully completed a specialisation in applied and visual arts under Otto Morach at the Zurich School of Applied Arts. The graphic designer Werner Zryd produced the layout. Recognition The small book, Das Auge der Liebe ('The Eye of Love'), though respected for its design and photography, caused some controversy, but also brought Groebli attention.Lacey, P. (1964). The history of the nude in photography (Vol. 9). Bantam Books. It was assembled from shots made on the belated honeymoon that the photographer and his wife Rita took over two weeks in Paris in 1952 and in the following year for a few days to Marseille, though publication of the photographs was not planned in 1953 Groebli sequenced it for a book, introducing a blank page to stand in for daytime in its chronology. In the Swiss Photorundschau, published by the Swiss Photographic Association, the editor Hermann K√∂nig traded correspondence with a specialist teacher of the School of Applied Arts where the book had been passed around and argued over, the term \\"love\\" in the title being considered by students to be too sentimental given the obvious sexual connotations. Where the photographer‚Äôs intention was for a romantic effect, the editor admitted that the narrative was sexualized.Hermann K√∂nig: ‚ÄûDas Auge der Liebe‚Äú. Lieber Otto! Offener Brief vom 23.

In the leading periodical Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitunghe, editor Edwin Arnet objected to the emphasis on nudity.Edwin Arnet \\"Drei Photob√ºcher von Schweizer Photographen'. In: Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung. Das Wochenende. Morgenausgabe Nr. 3057, Blatt 4, Wochenende 49, Samstag, 4. Dezember 1954. Groebli sequenced his photographs to tell the story of a woman meeting a man in a cheap hotel. The last photograph shows the woman's hand with a wedding ring on her ring finger holding an almost finished post-coitus cigarette. In the perception of audiences of the era, the implication was that the woman had to be either an ‚Äòeasy woman‚Äô, a prostitute, or an unfaithful wife. However the U.S. Camera Annual review of the work in 1955 pronounced it \\"a tender photo-essay on a photographer‚Äôs love for a woman.‚Äù After the death of photojournalist Paul Senn in 1953 and the killing of Werner Bischof in Peru in 1954, Kurt Blum, Robert Frank and Ren√© Groebli were newly admitted to the Kollegium Schweizerischer Photographen.Fondation Suisse pour la photographie (Hg.): La photographie en Suisse. 1840 √† nos jours, Bern, Benteli 1992. A major exhibition organized by the 'Kollegium' in 1955 convinced criticsEdwin Arnet, 'Kollegium Schweizerischer Photographen', Camera 3, (March 1951), 74. that a new 'Swiss style'Hollis, R. (2009).

However, the association was soon disbanded because of disagreements between Gotthard Schuh and Jakob Tuggener, and Groebli had by then relinquished photojournalism. In the same year, and with four other Swiss photographers, Werner Bischof, Robert Frank, Gotthard Schuh and Sabine Weiss, Ren√© Groebli was represented with a picture in the exhibition The Family of Man curated by Edward Steichen for the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His available-light photo shows a tight crowd of excited, dancing teenagers, their movement blurred in the style of Magie der Schiene. Studio photographer Groebli launched his own studio for commercial industrial and advertising photography in 1955 in the newly built residential and studio building in Zurich-Wollishofen. Photographers who worked for him included Rolf Lyssy, Margareth Bollinger, Roland Gl√§ttli, Ruth W√ºst, Roland Gretler,Roland Gretler in the online work on historical photography in Switzerland, fotoCH, retrieved on Nov 17, 2018 Marlies Tschopp and others. Many well-known graphic artists such as Werner Zryd, Victor N. Cohen, Karl Gerstner and Manfred Tulke commissioned the studio for lucrative photo assignments. In 1957, the American photographic journal Popular Photography published in its 'Color Annual' a twelve-page image series hyperbolically entitled 'Ren√© Groebli - Master of Color'.Bruce Downes (Ed.): Ren√© Groebli ‚Äì Master of Color. In: Ders.: Popular Photography Color Annual. Page 106‚Äì117. 1957. New York. p.106‚Äì117. In the 1950s, Groebli produced dye transfer prints from colour slides of commercial work printed in his studio with the specialists Werner Bruggmann in Winterthur and Raymund Schlauch in Frauenfeld. On April 18, 1959, he also founded Turnus Film AG, together with Hans-Peter Roth-Grieder of Gutenswil, R. A. Baezner in Geneva, P. Grieder, Zurich and Dr. med. W. H. Vock of Basel, with a registered share capital of two hundred and seventy thousand Swiss francs, with Groebli as executive.Turnus Information 1. Eight-page booklet, 1962 At the end of the 1950s, Groebli also had his home and studio converted and enlarged and in addition to two studios and two black and white labs, a dye transfer workshop with several laboratory workstations was added. The expensive dye transfer enlargements were then a profitable business and specialist Ruedi Butz ran the studio from 1960 to 1972 with the expert assistance of John Whitehall. From 1972 to 1978 Derek Dawson took over the management of dye transfer production. In 1963 Groebli founded the limited partnership Groebli + Guler with lithographer Walter Guler, renamed 'Fotolithos' in 1968. The workplace in Zurich-Wollishofen was equipped with the latest and best technical facilities and through the 1960s and early 1970s the business employed a staff of up to twelve, with good profits made from servicing the advertising photography industry. Important employees who worked at Groebli from the 1960s to the late 1970s, were, among others, photographers Felix Eidenbenz, Lotti Fetzer, Tom Hebting, Matthias Hofstetter, Peter Oberle, Anna Halm Schudel and Peter Schudel, Liselotte Straub, Katharina Vonow, and Heinz Walti, the volunteer Dona de Carli, re-photographer Jean-Pierre Tr√ºmpler, laboratory technician Sylvette Fran√ßoise Tr√ºmpler-Hofmann and Uschi Schliep, apprentice. After ten years producing specialist colour photography, dye transfer production and colour lithographs for commercial advertising and industrial photography, in 1965 Groebli published his third photo book Variation through Arthur Niggli Verlag, Teufen.Bucher-chronik: VARIATION. (1966). Graphis, 22(124), 190.Some New Books On Architecture And Art. (1966). Apollo (Archive : 1925-2005), 83(52), 481. It presented a retrospective of possibilities of Groebli‚Äôs colour photography, though with scant mention of the role of his many employees and business partners. In 1971 he issued a second edition Variation 2, with updated information on colour technology including Cibachrome.B√ºcher Chronik: Ren√© Groebli, Variation 2. (1971). Graphis (Archive : 1944-2005), 27(155), 330. Late career In the 1970s, talented young photographers, including former Groebli co-workers and employees, opened their own photo studios and strove to answer the ever higher demands of advertising agencies and the increased pressure of competition. By the late 1970s, with the more widespread adoption and acceptance of chromogenic methods of colour production less technically demanding and cheaper than dye transfer, Groebli ceased commercial photography and colour production, sold his home and studio and retired, though he still maintained connections with the industry and presented a paper on dye transfer at the 1977 Rencontres d'Arles.Messer, W. (1977). 'Rencontres' at Arles. The British Journal of Photography, 124(6101), 552-555. Groebli returned to making personal photographic essays in colour and in black and white, in series titled Fantasies, Ireland, The Shell, Burned Trees, N. Y. Visions, New York Melancholia and Nudes. Over the decades of the turn of the century, he worked on his image archive and digitised the most important photographs that he had taken over a career of sixty years. Groebli currently resides in Switzerland.

Tanaka represented Japan at the Venice Biennale in 2013. He was Deutsche Bank's \\"Artist of the Year\\" in 2015. In 2017, Tanaka exhibited at the Skulptur Projekte M√ºnster. His piece was of eight M√ºnster residents with diverse backgrounds in a workshop on how to live together. The exhibition was temporarily closed after some of the equipment used in the installation were stolen in a string of vandalism and theft at the event. In 2018 he was a Japan Cultural Envoy as part of another Agency for Cultural Affairs program.  Style  Early in his career, Tanaka was fascinated with forms and looping video of everyday phenomenon. As his career progressed, he began making videos of ordinary objects being repetitively manipulated, focusing entirely on the object, rather than the person interacting with it. After moving to Los Angeles in 2010, Tanaka began moving in a new direction where he would ask multiple people to do the same thing at once, such getting a hair cut from nine hair stylists at the same time, or having five pianists play on the same piano at once. This would remove the participants from their routine, and challenges the ordinary in a similar way to his earlier work. Tanaka's process involves gathering and then assembling cheap, easy to find objects, such as those found in 100-yen shops. After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster, Tanaka's work began to focus on the temporary communities brought together by crisis.

The book received positive reviews, praising it as a well- written discussion of its subject. Summary Welsh discusses Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams. Publication history Freud's Wishful Dream Book was published in 1994 by Princeton University Press. Reception Freud's Wishful Dream Book received positive reviews from Joel Schwartz in The Review of Metaphysics, Roger Smith in History, Nicholas Rand in Modern Philology, and Jonathan Elmer in Victorian Studies, and a mixed review from Jeremy Tambling in Modern Language Review. The book was also reviewed by Richard Mizen in the Journal of Analytical Psychology. Schwartz described the book as well-written and credited Welsh with providing a helpful discussion of Freud's work and its influence, as well as an \\"invaluable\\" discussion of The Interpretation of Dreams. However, he also wrote that he was not always convinced by Welsh's tendency to explain psychoanalysis in terms of late 19th century culture. Smith praised Welsh's discussion of The Interpretation of Dreams. He considered it an advantage that the book was \\"neither for nor against Freud\\", and called it both \\"stimulating\\" and \\"provocative\\". Rand described the book as well-written and \\"delightful\\". He praised Welsh's discussion of how Freud tried to convince his readers of the truth of his claims. However, he found Welsh's arguments about the scientific status of Freud's work weak. Elmer praised Welsh's discussion of The Interpretation of Dreams, although he also found him inconsistent in his approach to the work. He complimented Welsh's discussion of links between Freud's work and the culture of Fin de si√®cle Europe. Tambling found Welsh's arguments and conclusions debatable.

It is a Spanish language dance, Latin and Caribbean-influenced pop song, featuring \\"very sticky, funny and cheerful\\" lyrics about falling for someone. Elias Leight of Rolling Stone called \\"Tu Manera\\" a \\"cheerful\\" mixture of American singer Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl\\" (2005), Peruvian band Novalima's \\"Machete\\" (2003) and material by Colombian band Bomba Est√©reo. In an interview, Inna described the track as \\"one of the most commercial songs\\" from Yo, as well as \\"super repetitive [and] uptempo\\". She also said on its creation: \\"It started with a bass[line] that we fell in love with. We wanted to do something super simple, not so many melodies. Just the bass by itself sounds like a hit.\\" Music video An accompanying music video for \\"Tu Manera\\" was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel on 7 March 2019. Note: Open description for credits. It was directed by Bogdan PƒÉun of NGM Creative, while Alexandru Mure»ôan was hired for its filming process. In an interview, Inna reflected on the shooting: \\"I had lots of fun at the shooting [...] Actually, I did not feel like I was at a shooting. I did everything that went through my head, without limits, like when I was little.\\" The video opens with a backwards-motion scene of the singer walking with a bicycle as people either put the set together or dismantle the set in the background. Throughout the rest of the clip, Inna proceeds into performing in front of a house in a dusty landscape, \\"dancing on the street, riding a bike and sitting on a red couch in a pickup truck\\", among other activities. Her fashion, as described by CelebMix's Jonathan Currinn, is \\"laidback and simple\\", with her wearing a yellow T-shirt reading the word \\"Love\\", Uhlsport red running shorts and Balenciaga trainers. According to Currinn, the music video reflects Inna's \\"bright and fun\\" energy and personality previously hinted at in the visuals for \\"Un Momento\\" (2011), \\"Wow\\" (2012) and \\"Good Time\\" (2014). Libertatea echoed Currinn's thoughts. Shock noticed the contrast between the dusty landscape and Inna's appearance that had \\"a touch of sensuality, fantasy and charm\\". In addition to the music video, a vertical video was also released online on 16 April 2019. Shot in Miami, it shows Inna \\"flaunt[ing] her figure in a yellow long sleeve bodysuit, paired with sunglasses whilst her hair [is] combed back away from her face\\".

Jonathan Currinn of CelebMix praised the video and its connection to the song's lyrics, likening the choreography to the one performed in Justin Bieber's \\"Love Yourself\\" (2015). He further wrote: \\"We always believed dancing and choreography wasn't a strong suit of Inna, hence why she never really included it in her previous visuals, however, we were clearly wrong as she completely nails every single step with her male partner, showcasing a fully-fleshed-out storyline from start to finish\\".

He was known for his work in developing Canberra, his involvement with the New State Movement, and his behind-the-scenes work with the Country Party. He was the younger brother of the writer Malcolm Henry Ellis. Early life Ellis was born in Mount Morgan, Queensland, the youngest child of Constance Jane (n√©e Ruegg) and Thomas James Ellis. His father was an Irish-born miner and his mother was born in England. He was raised solely by his mother from the age of three, when she and the children moved to the Brisbane suburb of Tingalpa. Ellis attended the local state school in Kelvin Grove before going on to Brisbane Grammar School. He became a cadet journalist at the age of 16. Journalism and life in Canberra From 1921 to 1922, Ellis worked in Melbourne as a member of a news agency serving regional newspapers. He later worked for metropolitan daily newspapers, and then in 1925 began writing for the Morning Post, the newspaper of the Victorian Country Party. Ellis moved to Canberra in 1927 as one of the first permanent press correspondents; he was one of the forerunners of the Canberra Press Gallery. He married Ray Arnot Maxwell, the daughter of federal MP George Maxwell, on 19 December 1930. Ellis was a \\"passionate advocate of local self-government\\" for Canberra and an advocate for the improvement of the capital's amenities, which were those of a small country town. He was the inaugural chairman of the Canberra Tourist Bureau from 1937 to 1940, and served on the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council, an elective office, from 1947 to 1951. In 1936, Ellis began working for the Department of Commerce as a commercial intelligence officer. He moved to Melbourne in 1940 and joined the Department of Munitions in an administrative capacity overseeing 600 employees. In 1944, Ellis moved back to Canberra and joined the Department of Post-War Reconstruction as deputy director of public relations. He wrote a letter to The Canberra Times in April 1945 criticising Interior Minister Joe Collings, accusing him of \\"laugh[ing] with contempt in the face of the common principles of administrative justice\\" and calling him \\"unfit to administer his Department\\". He was subsequently charged under the Public Service Act and fined ‚Ç§2 for contravening regulations. Ellis's final public- service position was in the Department of Information from 1946 to 1947. He subsequently established a rural lobby group, the Office of Rural Research. Politics In 1928, Ellis was appointed private secretary to Earle Page, the leader of the Country Party. They became close friends, and Ellis shared Page's passion for the New State Movement, which advocated for the creation of new states in regional New South Wales and Queensland. In 1933, Ellis served as the publicity officer for Charles Hardy's Riverina Movement, which advocated the secession of the Riverina from the rest of New South Wales. The following year, he gave evidence before the New South Wales royal commission on new states, chaired by Judge Harold Sprent Nicholas. Ellis served on the executive of the New England New State Movement from 1948, and he and his wife moved to Armidale, New South Wales, in 1960. He campaigned for the \\"Yes\\" vote in the 1967 New England secession referendum, which failed. During the 1950s, Ellis served as \\"publicist, valet, chauffeur, nursemaid and baggage handler\\" to Arthur Fadden, the leader of the Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister. He published two histories of the Country Party: The Country Party: A Political and Social History of the Party in New South Wales (1958), and A History of the Australian Country Party (1963).

Therefore, the local people living in the area have had the custom of singing folk songs since ancient times. This kind of art was called \\"Wu Yu\\" in the period of Spring and Autumn Period and Warring States.

Mount Lorette's nearest higher peak is Skogan Peak, to the north-northwest. Mount Lorette is a landmark that can be seen from Highway 40 north of the Kananaskis Village area. History It was named in 1922 for Lorette Spur, a ridge to the north of Vimy Ridge which was the scene of very heavy fighting during World War I.Mount Lorette PeakFinder Capturing Lorette Spur marked a significant battle in French military history. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1952 by R.C. Hind, B. Richardson, L. Keeling, J. Manry, J. Dodds, and C. McAllister. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1953 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Mount Lorette is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

The narrative was adapted from Aatish Kapadia‚Äôs Gujarati novel of the same name. The series was produced by Hats Off Productions. Plot The story begins with Aditya Balraj surrendering to the police and confessing to murder. Following his arrest, he decides to write his memoirs in his prison cell, and through these memoirs, we see the story of Aditya Balraj's family. Aditya is a successful businessman, running a silk manufacturing industry. He is married to Divya. Despite all their happiness, they are unable to have a child even after many years of marriage. Fortune takes a turn for them when Divya becomes pregnant in the eighth year of their marriage. However, the child is stillborn. As Aditya's brother is about to bury the lifeless child, the baby boy shows signs of life upon getting wet in the rain. An astrologer then prophesies that the child will have a happy life until he turns five years old, which makes Aditya paranoid about the protection of his child. The story then moves ahead by five years. Aditya's son, Dev Aditya Balraj has grown up to be a smart boy. Aditya dotes over him and has managed to successfully expand his business over the years. Dev is similarly adored by the full joint family. However, Dev is very eco-friendly and is horrified when he learns of how the silk manufacturing process involves the killing of silkworms. Dev begins to resent his father. Unable to bear this, Aditya decides to shut down his business. This brings the ire of the family down upon Dev, as they were all dependent on Aditya. The Balrajs nearly go bankrupt and are forced to move into a chawl. Meanwhile, Aditya continues to research and his team stumbles upon a new process of manufacturing silk, that does not involve the killing of silkworms. Branding it as Ahimsa Silk (English: 'non-violent), Aditya relaunches his business. Aditya's competitors, some of whom were earlier his associates, suffer from heavy losses due to the widespread adoption of Ahimsa Silk. After finding out that Dev was responsible for this entire series of events, they murder the innocent child. Aditya is devastated with the loss of his son, and vows to find his son's murderer and avenge him.

The song was released as the album's lead single on 14 November 2018. Who co-wrote the song with JHart, Pretty Sister and Peter Thomas Walsh, the lattermost of whom produced the track. A musical departure from Who's typically upbeat, synth-driven material, \\"Between You & Me\\" is an acoustic pop song featuring minimal production and prominent guitar instrumentation throughout; its confessional lyrics describe seeking romance from a friend whose feelings and intentions are unclear. Who co-wrote the song based on personal experience with past relationships in which she questioned her own feelings, finding this theme relatable to both listeners and her co-writers. The product of an initially unsuccessful writing session, the songwriters stopped writing \\"Between You & Me\\" midway because Who was dissatisfied with its electronic direction. The songwriters eventually revisited the song after re-arranging it using only a guitar, ultimately completing the track six months later. Who opted to release \\"Between You & Me\\" as the album's first single over a more upbeat track that had also been considered because it reminds her of her early songwriting career. One of her first singles as an independent artist since departing from RCA Records, Who considers the song's release an expression of her creative freedom. \\"Between You & Me\\" has garnered acclaim from music critics, who praised its acoustic production and Who's songwriting. An accompanying music video was released in November 2018, in which Who plays both characters exploring a same-sex relationship.  Background and writing  \\"Between You & Me\\" was written by Jessica Newham (Betty Who) with James Abrahart (JHart), Zakariah Stucchi (Pretty Sister) and Peter Thomas Walsh. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' Thomas Walsh also produced the track. According to Who, \\"Between You & Me\\" resulted from an initially unsuccessful session during which they had stopped writing the song midway because the singer was dissatisfied with its electronic direction, asking that they revisit it at a later time. Who and JHart then brainstormed new approaches to the song outside of the studio and proceeded to re-write it using only a guitar. Who explained that this method \\"completely changed the vibe from what we had been working on earlier\\", which was \\"a little bit lifeless ... I wanted to do something that felt different, that feels really meaningful.\\" Who greatly preferred the new acoustic arrangement. The songwriters did not complete the song until six months later when Who re-discovered it. The singer drew inspiration from personal experience having feelings for others while questioning whether they are legitimate, or if she should express them. Who recalls several \\"instances in my life where you wish that you could have this really candid conversation with the person you have feelings for but it just goes unsaid\\", and found this experience to be universal among her co-writers, with whom she discussed how often people must feel similarly. Who believes this experience has grown more common in modern times because of social media, explaining that \\"human interaction and confrontation has gotten\\" more difficult. Revealing that the track makes her feel emotional, the singer identified \\"Between You & Me\\" as an ode to how she began writing music originally, recalling a time when she was 14 years-old and using solely a guitar or piano to write about her feelings. Admitting that the song's \\"soft and demure\\" nature was a conscious decision to a certain extent, Who explained that she intended \\"to switch things up\\" and \\"emphasize the fact that I just wanna write songs\\". Who claims its lyrics are \\"one of my favorite stories I‚Äôve ever told,‚Äù expounding, \\"It feels so good to finally have it out in the world instead of banging around my own brain.\\" Thematically, Who drew similarities between the song and \\"Just Thought You Should Know\\", another track written for her then-forthcoming album. A fan of the television series Parks and Recreation, Who also believes the song serves as a suitable anthem for characters Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) before they became a couple.  Release  \\"Between You & Me\\" was released on 14 November 2018 by AWAL Recordings, as the lead single from Who's third studio album Betty. It was distributed to several online music services, including Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Google Play, Deezer and Tidal. \\"Between You & Me\\" was one of Who's first singles as an independent artist following her departure from RCA Records after the release of her second album The Valley (2017). Who chose the song as the album's first single because it reminds her of her early years as a burgeoning singer-songwriter. Who and the album's producers had considered releasing a different song as the lead single but opted to withhold the other track because the singer felt it more suitable for summer, believing that \\"Between You & Me\\" \\"feels like Christmas to me. Like you wanna cuddle up on the couch and drink a really dark red wine to it.\\" Who believes that the song may have been hindered had she still been signed to a major label because it sounds \\"too different\\", considering its release to be a \\"win\\" and expression of her newfound creative freedom, as well as \\"another facet of what I do\\". Who continued, \\"I just wanna release the music that I wanna release regardless of genre, and especially because of my situation being able to make the record I want to make‚Äù without external input. Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos agreed that the song's release is \\"A brand new declaration of independence\\". Idolator contributor Mike Wass believed that the single's selection indicated that the rest of the album would resemble \\"a throwback to the bare-bones, super-powered pop\\" similar to Who's EP The Movement (2013). However, Who contested that the track's acoustic nature was simply an arrangement she felt that song in particular deserved, explaining \\"It's definitely not an indication of what the rest of the record sounds like, because I think they're all a little bit different. There isn't anything else on the record that is quite like\\" \\"Between You & Me\\", believing that the planned follow-up single would surprise listeners because \\"it's such a big pop, dance song.\\" Although she agrees that the song's \\"stripped-back\\" arrangement is a departure from most of her material, Who explained that each track on Betty was deliberately written to sound different from each other, maintaining that \\"Between You & Me\\" \\"emotionally ... fits really well on the record.\\" \\"Between You & Me\\" followed the release of Who's five-track extended play Betty, Pt. 1 (2018).  Music and lyrics  \\"Between You & Me\\" is a sensual, emotional acoustic pop song with indie pop influences, lasting three minutes and fifteen seconds (3:15) in duration. Consisting of \\"plucky\\", finger-picked acoustic guitars that drive its instrumentation, the song is considered to be a \\"stripped-back\\" deviation from the singer's synth-pop repertoire. Beginning with minimal production, the song gradually adopts \\"a more synth-textured beat,\\" while Who's vocals \\"remain at the forefront, carrying the emotional weight of the track.\\" Liv Toerkell, writing for The AU Review, agreed that the song \\"is less the electro house anthem that we are used to ... The mellow guitar play and a quiet synth-textured beat, lay the emotional weight of this stripped-back single entirely onto Betty‚Äôs smooth vocals.\\" The same guitar chords are repeated throughout the track, only introducing sparse additional production during its chorus. Music critic Thomas Bleach observed that the song's minimal production mirrors its storyline and emotion. Who believes that \\"Between You & Me\\" remains a pop, guitar-driven song with \\"enough\\" production. Mike Nied of Idolator identified the song as a confessional track, beginning with Who singing \\"It‚Äôs too crowded in this bar. We‚Äôve been small-talking so far. I can‚Äôt tell if we‚Äôre friends. You sure like to make fun of my ex. But we never get past this part.\\" Nicole Engelman of Billboard expressed that, throughout the song, Who longs for \\"more than friendship\\" from her friend and love interest. Who sings, \\"Don‚Äôt wanna give myself away, because I‚Äôm trying so hard not to say,\\" followed by heartfelt lyrics such as \\"Just between you and me/I can feel something here/Wondering if you do too.‚Äù Who continues \\"Just between you and me/Can‚Äôt help but feeling we‚Äôre acting/Like lovers do\\" using a soft, breathy voice, wondering about her relationship status with her \\"flirtatious friend\\" during its hook. Confused by the intentions of her love interest, Who questions how their relationship would progress if they were to explore being intimate with each other for once, beginning \\"sweet and emotional\\" before incorporating a sexual \\"tinge\\" as the singer wonders \\"how things could go down,\\" singing, \\"Why can‚Äôt we just address it? Why don‚Äôt we start undressing until there‚Äôs nothing in between us, in between you and me.\\" The song also discusses themes associated with unrequited love. Florence Johannot of L'Officiel USA likened Who's \\"raspy but powerful\\" vocals to those of singers P!nk and Natasha Bedingfield. According to Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos, \\"The verses detail close encounters between the two and her desire for them to make the spark a full-fledged fire.\\" Who described the track as an \\"inner monologue of everything I wish I could say to that person when you‚Äôre in that feeling\\", elaborating, \\"the tension between friends that can grow and infest every silence or lingering smile can consume you.\\" However, Who distinguished that the song is \\"not a confession of love\\" but rather \\"a voice in your head narrating your time\\" together, particularly struggling to verbalize \\"how you feel when you‚Äôre around the person you‚Äôre singing to.\\" As such, the protagonist never voices these concerns. Ticketfly described Who's lyrics as \\"achingly up-close.\\" The Montana Kaimin's Connor Simpson believes that the song exemplifies \\"The intersection of happiness and anxiety ... familiar to the LGBTQ+ community\\". Adi Mehta of the Entertainment Voice observed that \\"Between You & Me\\"'s lyrics are \\"suspiciously similar to the refrain of Sisq√≥‚Äôs 'Thong Song'.\\"  Reception  Upon release, \\"Between You & Me\\" garnered critical acclaim from several media publications. NewNowNext ranked the song among \\"5 Songs You Need to Hear Today\\". Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone called its hook \\"infectious\\". Spanos wrote that, in addition to being \\"perfect\\" for \\"Getting a little closer to a seemingly forbidden crush\\", the track indicates \\"a promising start\\" for the artist. Notion's staff deemed it \\"an acoustic masterpiece\\". The AU Review's Liv Toerkell praised Who for successfully delivering \\"a throwback single, to one‚Äôs teenage years, even though it was just released this week.\\" Mike Nied, writing for Idolator, expected the song to be \\"a serious hit\\" for the singer with strong airplay potential, encouraging radio stations to play it. Vanyaland's Michael Marotta described \\"Between You & Me\\" as \\"a glistening\\" track that features Who \\"clearing her mind and baring her soul.\\" A writer for Contactmusic.com reviewed the song as \\"an excellent preview of what's to come from Betty Who.\\" Calling the song \\"the most well-assembled track\\" on Betty, The Post critic Halle Weber hailed the track for providing the album with more depth towards the latter half of the LP, describing it as \\"annoyingly catchy yet simultaneously chill.\\" Weber concluded that \\"Between You & Me\\" remains the album's \\"most impressive\\" song \\"because it takes Who out of her comfort zone of old-school-meets-modern dance pop, but she still maintains her signature edge\\", and found its lustful theme to be a welcome departure from the otherwise \\"emotionally-charged record.\\" L'Officiel USA's Florence Johannot wrote that the track will \\"keep [the listener] company on this Friday night\\" during their walk home. By the end of November 2018, the song had been streamed on Spotify over 400,000 times. By January 2019, the single had amassed more than 500,000 online streams.  Music video and live performances  An accompanying music video for the song was released on 28 November 2018, in which Who stars as a same-sex couple, playing both herself and her love interest as they navigate having strong feelings towards each other. Reprising her role from the music video for her previous single \\"Taste\\", in which she had played the same characters, both videos revolve around a relationship between two women. Who herself identifies as bisexual and is an active LGBT ally. The video explores both \\"the highs and lows\\" of the women's relationship. After meeting at a party, the characters proceed to spend more time with and get to know each other in \\"a will-they-won't-they\\" dynamic. With a festive Christmas theme, the characters flirt, take photographs and open presents before finally joining each other underneath a mistletoe. Since she was playing both roles, Who was required to film the entire video twice and was surprised to find herself convinced by her own performance, joking, \\"I can‚Äôt believe how bad I wanted me to end up with myself!‚Äù The music video was positively received, particularly by LGBT publications. Out's Glenn Garner described the video as \\"the cutest queer love story that we need adapted into a feature-length film in time for the holidays\\". Praising its \\"powerful pro- LGBT message and striking visuals,\\" Notion hailed the video as an \\"homage to the year two thousand and gayteen ‚Äì and proves that next year is going to be just as epic for Australia‚Äôs rising pop heroine.\\" Williams of NewNowNext praised the video's \\"fun concept\\". Prior to the beginning of her U. S. tour, Who performed \\"Between You & Me\\" live at the Better Sorts Social Club in Boston as part of the Kimpton Nine Zero Hotel's Off the Record series. In September 2019, Who performed the song during the Bustle Rule Breakers 2019 event at the Lefrak Center at Lakeside Prospect Park in Brooklyn, NY.

As offshore developments move into deeper waters, gravity-based structures become less economical due to the large size needed and the consequent cost of transportation. Each of several embedded- anchor types presents its own advantages for anchoring offshore structures. The choice of anchoring solution depends on multiple factors, such as the type of offshore facility that requires mooring, its location, economic viability, the lifetime of its use, soil conditions, and resources available. Examples of facilities that may need mooring are floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units, mobile offshore drilling units, offshore oil production platforms, wave power and other renewable energy converters, and floating liquefied natural gas facilities. Drag-embedment anchors Drag- embedment anchors (DEA) derive their holding capacity from being buried, or embedded, deep within the seabed with their anchoring capacity being directly related to embedment depth. DEAs are installed by means of dragging, using a mooring chain or wire, this relatively simple means of installation making the DEA a cost-effective option for anchoring offshore structures. DEAs are commonly used for temporary moorings of offshore oil and gas structures, e.g. mobile offshore drilling units. Their use in only temporary mooring situations may be largely attributed to uncertainty involving the anchor's embedding trajectory and placement in the soil, which results in uncertainty with regard to the anchor's holding capacity. Under ideal conditions, DEAs are one of the most efficient types of anchors, with holding capacities ranging from 33 to greater than 50 times their weight; and such efficiency gives DEAs an inherent advantage over other anchoring solutions such as caissons and piles, since the mass of a DEA is concentrated deep within the seabed where soil resistance and, hence, holding capacity, is greatest. Anchor efficiency is defined as the ratio between the ultimate holding capacity and the dry weight of the anchor, with DEAs often possessing significantly higher efficiency ratios compared to other anchoring solutions. Catenary (left) and taut (right) mooring solutions. A catenary configuration consists of \\"slack\\" mooring lines that form a catenary shape under their own weight. Since the catenary mooring lines lie flat along the seabed, they exert only horizontal forces on their anchors. Taut mooring lines arriving at an angle to the seabed exert both horizontal and vertical forces on their anchors. Since DEAs are designed to resist horizontal forces only, these anchors may only be used in a catenary-moored configuration. Applying a significant vertical load to a DEA will result in its failure, as pressure will be applied to the padeye and thus result in anchor retrieval. However, this does facilitate anchor retrieval, which contributes to the cost effectiveness of this anchoring solution. = Design = Drag embedment anchor components (fluke, shank, and padeye) The three main components of a DEA are the fluke, shank, and padeye. For a DEA, the angle between the fluke and the shank is fixed at approximately 30 degrees for stiff clays and sand, and 50 degrees for soft clays.  Fluke  The fluke of a plate anchor is a bearing plate that provides the large majority of the anchors holding capacity at its ultimate embedment depth. As well as contributing to anchor capacity, the fluke may contribute to anchor stability during embedment. Adopting a wider fluke can help in providing rolling stability which allows for deeper embedment and better holding capacity.Aubeny, C., Gilbert, R., Randall, R., Zimmerman, E., McCarthy, K., Chen, C., Drake, A., Yeh, P., Chi, C., and Beemer, R. (2011). The Performance of Drag Embedment Anchors (DEA). Texas A & M University, United States. There are industry guidelines pertaining to both the appropriate width, length, and thickness of anchor flukes, where width refers to the dimension perpendicular to the direction of embedment. Commercial anchors typically have a fluke width-to-length ratio of 2:1 and a fluke length-to- thickness ratio between 5 and 30.  Shank  During embedment, anchor design should focus on minimising soil resistance perpendicular to the embedment trajectory of the anchor, allowing for deeper embedment. Since DEAs derive their strength from their embedment depth, the shank should be designed such that soil resistance perpendicular to the anchor's embedment trajectory should be minimised. Frictional soil resistance against the parallel component of the shank, however, is less significant. Thus, the area of the shank in line with the direction of the embedment trajectory is often relatively large to provide anchor stability against rolling during embedment.  Padeye  The padeye is the connection between the anchor and mooring line. Padeye eccentricity, often measured as the padeye offset ratio, is the relationship between the horizontal and vertical distance of the padeye position in relation to the fluke‚Äìshank connection of an anchor. The evaluation of the optimal padeye eccentricity for DEAs and vertically loaded anchors (VLAs) is limited to the appropriate choice of shank length given a fixed fluke‚Äìshank angle during embedment. A study conducted to investigate appropriate shank lengths considered a range of shank-length to fluke-length ratios between 1 and 2. It was determined that the shorter shank lengths (closer to ratios of 1) produced deeper anchor embedment.  Mooring Line  Although the mooring line is not an anchor component unique to the DEA, its design significantly influences the behaviour of the anchor. A thicker mooring line makes for more resistance to anchor embedment. The properties of chain, versus wire, mooring lines have been investigated, with chain mooring lines causing reductions in anchor capacity of up to 70%.Beemer, Ryan & Aubeny, Charles & Randall, R & Drake, A. (2012). Predictive model for drag embedment anchor performance in clay seabed. Proceedings of the 17th Offshore Symposium: Pushing Boundaries in the Global Industry. A27-A34. Thus, where appropriate and cost-efficient, wire mooring lines should be used. The embedded section of a mooring line contributes to the anchor's holding capacity against horizontal movement. It is, therefore, appropriate to analyse the contribution of the anchor's mooring line with respect to both the embedment process of the anchor and its contribution to the final anchor holding capacity. Vertically-loaded anchors Anchor transition from DEA to VLA mode. Vertically-loaded anchors (VLAs) are essentially DEAs that are free to rotate about the fluke-shank connection, which allows the anchor to withstand both vertical and horizontal loading and thus, unlike DEAs, mooring lines may be in either a catenary or taut-moored configuration. VLAs are embedded as DEAs are, over a specified drag length. As a result, much of the design considerations required for DEAs is applicable to VLAs. Following the drag length insertion, the fluke is \\"released\\" and allowed to rotate freely about its connection with the shank. This new anchor configuration results in the mooring line load being essentially normal to the fluke of the VLA.  Suction caissons  Suction caisson solution Suction caissons (also known as suction buckets, suction piles, or suction anchors) are a new class of embedded anchors that have a number of economic advantages over other methods. They are essentially upturned buckets that are embedded into the soil and use suction, by pumping out the water to create a vacuum, to anchor offshore floating facilities. They present a number of economic benefits, including quick installation and removal during decommissioning, as well as a reduction in material costs. The caisson consists of a large- diameter cylinder (typically in the range), open at the bottom and closed at the top, with a length-to-diameter ratio in the range of 3 to 6. This anchoring solution is used extensively in large offshore structures, offshore drilling and accommodation platforms. Since the rise in the demand for renewable energy, such anchors are now used for offshore wind turbines, typically in a tripod configuration.  Suction-embedded plate anchors  SEPLA Installation: (1) Suction installation, (2) Caisson-retrieval, (3) Anchor keyring, (4) Mobilised anchor In 1997, the suction-embedded plate anchor (SEPLA) was introduced as a combination of two proven anchoring concepts‚Äîsuction piles and plate anchors‚Äîto increase efficiency and reduce costs. Today, SEPLA anchors are used in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of West Africa, and in many other locations. The SEPLA uses a suction \\"follower\\", an initially water-filled, open-bottom caisson, to embed a plate anchor into soil. The suction follower is lowered to the seabed where it begins to penetrate under its own weight. Water is then pumped from the interior of the caisson to created a vacuum that pushes the plate anchor underneath to the desired depth (Step 1). The plate anchor mooring line is then disengaged from the caisson, which is retrieved by water being forced into the caisson, causing it to move upwards whilst leaving the plate anchor embedded (Step 2). Tension is then applied to the mooring line (Step 3), causing the plate anchor to rotate (a process also known as \\"keying\\") to be perpendicular to the direction of loading (Step 4). This is done so that the maximum surface area is facing the direction of loading, maximising the resistance of the anchor. As a suction-caisson follower is used, SEPLA anchors can be classified as direct-embedment anchors; and thus the location and depth of the anchor are known. Because of their geotechnical efficiency, SEPLA plate anchors are significantly smaller and lighter than the equivalent suction anchors, thus reducing costs.  Dynamically installed anchors  Different types of Dynamically Installed Anchors The increased cost of installing anchors in deep water has led to the inception of dynamically penetrating anchors that embed themselves into the seabed by free-fall. These anchors typically consist of a thick-walled, steel, tubular shaft filled with scrap metal or concrete and fitted with a conical tip. Steel flukes are often attached to the shaft to improve its hydrodynamic stability and to provide additional frictional resistance against uplift after installation. The main advantage of dynamically installed anchors is that their use is not restricted by water depth. Costs are reduced, as no additional mechanical interaction is required during installation. The simple anchor design keeps fabrication and handling costs to a minimum. Additionally, the ultimate holding capacity of dynamic anchors is less dependent on the geotechnical assessment of the location, as lower shear-strengths permit greater penetration which increases the holding capacity. Despite these advantages, this anchor type's major disadvantage is the degree of uncertainty in predicting embedment depth and orientation and the resultant uncertain holding capacity. = Design = Several different forms of dynamically installed anchors have been designed since their first commercial development in the 1990s. The deep-penetrating anchor (DPA) and the torpedo anchor have seen widespread adoption in offshore South American and Norwegian waters. Their designs are shown in the figure with two other forms of dynamically installed anchors, namely the Omni-Max and the dynamically embedded plate anchor (DEPLA). Deep-penetrating and torpedo anchors are designed to reach maximum velocities of at the seabed, allowing for tip penetration of two to three times the anchor length, and holding capacities in the range of three to six times the weight of the anchor after soil consolidation. DEPLA components Omni-Max Anchor The dynamically-embedded plate anchor (DEPLA) is a direct-embedment, vertically-loaded anchor that consists of a plate embedded in the seabed by the kinetic energy obtained by freefall in water. This new anchor concept has only been recently developed but has been tested both in the lab and field. The different components of the DEPLA can be seen in the labeled diagram in the figure. The Omni-Max anchor pictured is a gravity-installed anchor that is capable of being loaded in any direction due to its 360-degree swivel feature. The anchor is manufactured from high- strength steel and possesses adjustable fluke fins that can be adapted to specific soil conditions. = Torpedo anchors = A torpedo anchor features a tubular steel shaft, with or without vertical steel fins, which is fitted with a conical tip and filled with scrap metal or concrete. Up to long, the anchor becomes completely buried within the seabed by free-fall. Full-scale field tests were performed in water at depths of up to using a long, diameter, torpedo anchor with a dry weight of . The torpedo anchor dropped from a height of above the seabed achieved penetration in normally consolidated clay. Subsequent tests with a torpedo anchor, with a dry weight of and an average tip embedment of , resulted in holding capacities of approximately 4 times the anchor's dry weight immediately following installation, which approximately doubled after 10 days of soil consolidation. While the efficiencies are lower than what would be obtained with other sorts of anchor, such as a drag embedment anchor, this is compensated by the low cost of fabrication and ease of installation. Therefore, a series of torpedo anchors can be deployed for station-keeping of risers and other floating structures. = Deep-penetrating anchors = A deep-penetrating anchor (DPA) is conceptually similar to a torpedo anchor: it features a dart-shaped, thick-walled, steel cylinder with flukes attached to the upper section of the anchor. A full-scale DPA is approximately in length, in diameter, and weighs on the order of . Its installation method is no different from that of the torpedo anchor: it is lowered to a predetermined height above the seabed and then released in free- fall to embed itself into the seabed.  Anchor piles  Embedded anchor piles (driven or drilled) are required for situations where a large holding capacity is required. The design of anchor piles allows for three types of mooring configurations‚Äîvertical tethers, catenary moorings, and semi-taut/taut moorings‚Äîwhich are used for the mooring of offshore structures such as offshore wind turbines, floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facilities, etc. An industrial example is the Ursa tension-leg platform (TLP) which has been held on-station by 16 anchor piles, each of which is long, in diameter, and weighs . = Design = Anchor Pile Installation Methods Anchor piles are hollow steel pipes that are either driven, or inserted into a hole drilled into the seabed and then grouted, similar to pile foundations commonly used in offshore fixed structures. The figure shows the different installation methods, where in the \\"driven\\" method, the steel tube is driven mechanically by a hammer, whilst in the \\"drilled\\" method a cast in-situ pile is inserted into an oversized borehole constructed with a rotary drill and then grouted with cement. Employment of a particular method depends on the geophysical and geotechnical properties of the seabed. Anchor piles are typically designed to resist both horizontal and vertical loads. The axial holding capacity of the anchor pile is due to the friction along the pile-soil interface, while the lateral capacity of the pile is generated by lateral soil resistance, where the anchor's orientation is critical to optimising this resistance. As a result, the location of the padeye is placed such that the force from the catenary or taut mooring will result in a moment equilibrium about the point of rotation, to achieve the optimal lateral soil resistance. = Installation = Due to the slender nature of anchor piles, there are three installation issues pertaining to driven piles, the first of which is the driveability of the piles at the location, or where excessive soil resistance may prevent penetration to the desired depth. The second issue is the deformation of the piles where tip collapse or buckling occurs due to excessive resistance and a deviation of pile trajectory. The third issue is the geotechnical properties of the soil. Insufficient lateral resistance by the soil may lead to a toppling of the anchor, and rocks and boulders along the penetration trajectory may lead to refusal and tip collapse. Installation issues pertaining to drilled-and-grouted piles include borehole stability, unwanted soft cuttings at the base of the hole, hydrofracture of the soil leading to loss of grout, and thermal expansion effects.

It was built from 1855 to 1857. It is also known as Longs Lane Terraces/Precinct (Jobbin's and Long's). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In 1807, this site is shown by Meehan's survey to contain a defined building alignment with a lane on the southern boundary. Artists' representations of the area from as early as 1803 up until show close settlement. Maps made in 1823, 1825, 1831, and 1842 show that the present site of the Jobbins Building was occupied by a row of small buildings, set well back from the current alignment of Gloucester Street. The alignment of Long's Lane was already established by the time the earliest of these maps (by Hoddle, 1823) was made. The row of houses fronting Gloucester Street is described in the Council rate assessment book of 1845 as a group of five wooden buildings with shingle roofs, all single storey with two rooms each, in \\"bad repair.\\" By the time of the next rate assessment, in 1848, one of the buildings had fallen down. The remainder of this group was demolished by 1850, when Wells' map shows a single structure at the corner of Gloucester Street and Long's Lane, on a large block of vacant land. The 1852 rate assessment indicated that the only improvement to the allotment was a timber stable with shingle roof. From 1839, the subject land, described as Allotment 1, Section 74 of the City of Sydney, was owned by John Jobbins, a convict transported for seven years arriving on the Fanny I in 1816. In 1822, at the expiry of his seven-year sentence, he was listed in the Colonial Secretary's papers as receiving an assigned convict. The 1828 Census lists him as a butcher in Cambridge Street. From 1836 Jobbins settled in the Gundaroo district as a grazier, and built the Nanima homestead in 1839. Jobbins owned the land at Gloucester Street until his death at , Victoria, on 8 January 1855. In December 1840 Jobbins leased the site, together with a neighbouring allotment across Caraher's Lane, to Edward Flood for a period of 20 years, at an annual rent of ¬£50. It appears that the five timber dwellings in \\"bad repair\\" were therefore under the management of Flood, who was perhaps also responsible for erecting the stable on the site by 1850. Shortly after John Jobbins' death in 1855, the executors of his estate oversaw construction of the terrace as an investment. The building was complete by 1858, when Council rate assessment books describe a group of brick terraces with slate roofs, of two floors and seven rooms each. An 1865 MWSDB map shows the earliest form of the buildings: 105 to 111 Gloucester Street with rear wings, 103 to 109 Gloucester Street with rear WC's, and 111 with a rear outbuilding. The houses have always been leased to tenants, with each tenant generally only staying a few years. Longer-term tenants of note include Anne Lewis, who ran a boarding house at No. 111 between 1861 and 1873; and Sydney Smith, a cab proprietor who occupied 111 Gloucester Street between 1882 and 1897 (making use of the gable-ended outbuilding at the rear of the building). From 1912 until at least the cessation of the Sands Directory in 1933, a grocer's shop occupied the ground floor of No. 111. The property remained in the hands of the Jobbins family and was managed by a series of agents, whose names are recorded in the Council rate assessment books. In 1864, the property was conveyed to Edward Jobbins of Yass, brother of John Jobbins, in accordance with John Jobbins' will. In 1870, Edward Jobbins made a Deed of Gift of three of the houses in the terrace (Nos. 107-111) to his daughter Mary Ann (a spinster of Gundaroo), and the remaining two (Nos. 103-105) to his son Peter (farmer of Gundaroo). In this deed the houses are referred to as 'commonly called or known as Jobbins Buildings.' About 1874, Peter agreed to convey his two houses to Mary Ann, however, this conveyance was not registered until 1889. Mary Ann held the land until her death on 6 April 1899. In 1902, the NSW Government resumed the land. The building continued to be tenanted until the 1960s and 1970s. The last house was vacated in the 1980s, the rear wings demolished, and the houses boarded up. Subsequently, squatters occupied the houses. Much of the joinery and many fixtures were stolen or demolished during the period of squatting. Between 1991 and 1993, an extensive programme of conservation works were carried out on the building. The work comprised stabilisation, restoration of the front fa√ßade and roofs, cutting in damp proof courses, and construction of new floors. Joinery, plastering, and other surface finishes were reconstructed on the basis of surviving original fabric. Rear wings were constructed on the extant footings of the earlier rear wings; however, only the external form of the original rear wings was reconstructed, allowing the interiors to be adapted for modern kitchens and bathrooms. The houses are now privately leased to tenants. The Sydney Cove Authority also carried out conservation works to the buildings and rear yards in the remainder of the Long's Lane Precinct, including 113-117 Gloucester Street and 130-142 Cumberland Street. This work was awarded the Australian Institute of Architects 1998 Lloyd Rees Award for Outstanding Urban Design.  Description  103-111 Gloucester Street is a part of the 'Long's Lane Precinct'. Long's Lane is a cluster of nineteenth and early-twentieth houses, rear yards, and laneways between Gloucester and Cumberland Streets, in The Rocks. 103-111 Gloucester Street is a very fine example of a Greek Revival terrace row. While relatively common in Sydney in mid-nineteenth century, extant examples of this style in Sydney are now very rare: Fitzroy Terrace, is the only other example known. The planning of the terrace emphasises the street fa√ßade incorporating a \\"break front\\", a diminished central pediment, and raised entrance stairs originally with an awning. The interior planning of the building is essentially \\"Two down - two up\\" with an attic space and rear wings. This is the most accomplished building in the precinct.Clive Lucas Stapleton, 1991: 55 The fabric of the buildings has remained essentially unchanged: iron roofs were installed and the rear of 105 and 111 Gloucester Street has incorporated additional outbuildings. The houses appear to have been renovated in the 1920s with the replacement of doors, windows, etc., and probable installation of electrical services.

Heritage listing  As at 26 June 2002, Jobbins Terrace and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Jobbins building and site are of historical, aesthetic, and scientific significance to the people of New South Wales for its ability to demonstrate the planning and design of residential accommodation in the Mid-Victorian period, and, as part of the Long's Lane precinct, in demonstrating the evolution of The Rocks in the 19th and early 20th centuries in an intact townscape context complete with laneways and rear yards intact. The Jobbins Building is of outstanding significance as a rare and very fine example of a Greek Revival breakfront terrace, one of only two known examples to survive in Sydney (and probably NSW) of what was, in the 19th century, a very common building style. The subject of extensive conservation works and archaeological investigation in the 1990s, the Jobbins Building is of State significance for its ability to demonstrate domestic life in The Rocks from pre-1830 to the present; particularly as the archaeological excavation has contributed materially to the understanding of the preferences and lifestyles of the occupants of the terrace over time Jobbins Terrace was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site of the Jobbins Building is historically significant as a site continuously occupied since at least the first decade of the 19th century. The Jobbins Building is historically significant as a key component in demonstrating the evolution of the Long's Lane precinct, which is a unique ensemble in The Rocks of 19th-century residential buildings, laneways, and rear yards. The Jobbins Building is of historical significance in its own right for the state of NSW as a reflection of the 1850s speculative development of The Rocks, and in documenting the spatial planning and quality of residential accommodation intended for occupation by the educated or professional classes in the mid-Victorian period. The history of the Jobbins Building's decline into dereliction, and the occupation of the building by squatters prior to the conservation works of the early 1990s reflects the changing social context of The Rocks from the late 19th century to the present. The decision of the State government to restore the building for residential (rather than commercial) purposes demonstrates a prevailing political will and public funding dedicated to the conservation of heritage in the post-Green Bans period in The Rocks. The Jobbins Building meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Jobbins Building is historically associated with John Jobbins and his descendants, as well as the numerous individuals and families who occupied the houses over time. However, it was a speculative development undertaken by the executors of Jobbins' estate, and one of a number of such investments. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Jobbins Building is aesthetically significant as a very fine example of a Greek Revival terrace row in NSW. The aesthetic significance of the building has been revealed and can now be better understood through reconstruction and conservation. The Jobbins Building makes a substantial contribution to the streetscape significance of The Rocks, particularly complementing the terraced character of the eastern side of Gloucester Street (including the Edwardian Cottages at 46-56 Gloucester Street, Susannah Place at 58-64 Gloucester Street, and Baker's Terrace at 66-72 Gloucester Street). The Jobbins Building makes a substantial contribution to the aesthetic significance of the Long's Lane Precinct as an ensemble of 19th- and early 20th-century buildings, associated laneways, and rear yards. The Jobbins Building meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As part of The Rocks area, the Jobbins Building is held in some esteem by the individuals and groups who are interested in Sydney's history and heritage. This is evidenced by the listing of the building on registers such as the National Trust of Australia and the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Jobbins Building site is of research significance as a rare example of a site yielding archaeological evidence of the pre-1830 period of European settlement in Sydney. The results of previous archaeological investigations of the site are fully documented and form, together with other projects carried out in the area, a valuable resource for understanding early life in The Rocks area. Further, the original design and planning of the Jobbins Building is intact and can provide a resource for the understanding of 19th-century domestic life, room uses, and spatial planning. The Jobbins Building is of some technical significance as an example of \\"academic\\" conservation work in which reconstructed fabric was strictly based on extant material and constructed in a traditional manner. The Jobbins Building meets this criterion on a State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Jobbins Buildings is a very fine example of terrace housing built in the Greek Revival style featuring a breakfront and diminished central pediment. Although once common in Sydney, it is now one of only two known examples of the style and is considered to be rare in NSW. The Jobbins Building meets this criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Jobbins Building is a good representative example of 1850s housing within the context of the Long's Lane precinct, itself a significant area in demonstrating the 19th-century townscape of The Rocks, complete with intact rear yards and laneways. The Jobbins Building is one of a small group of mid-19th-century terraces extant in Sydney. Although it is an example of this period, it is of a higher architectural order than the surviving examples, and therefore is not considered to be particularly representative of the entire group. The Jobbins Building meets this criterion on a State level.

Life Therese Pop was born in Pressburg, the daughter of a Hungarian landowner. She was only 16 when in 1829 she married Georg Johann Wilhelm Megerle von M√ºhlfeld in Pre√üburg. He was a surgeon and dentist. His bride came to the marriage with 60,000 Gulden, which was a very substantial dowry. It enabled Megerle to embark on a change of career. He abandoned his medical work and took over the city theatre. Later, in 1850, he took over at the Theater in der Josefstadt on the western side of Vienna. Partly through a lack of business acumen and partly through bad luck he managed to lose all his (and his wife's) money. The Josefstadt theatre was well established and apparently busy during the four years he spent there. Nevertheless, as one commentator observed, he was neither the first nor the last theatre director who came to grief at the Josefstadt. After becoming bankrupt Megerle died, at which point it is said that he left for his wife nothing but a suit. In the middle of all this sadness, his widow displayed remarkable energy as she set about building herself a career as a dramatist. She had already begun to establish herself as a writer, with novellas and short stories published in magazines or journals such as Sonntagsbl√§tter (loosely \\"Sunday pages\\") and its successor publication, \\"Ludwig Augustus Frankl's Abendzeitung\\" (\\"Ludwig Augustus Frankl's Evening Paper\\"), and she had thereby met with some modest success. A collection of her pieces was published in three volumes in 1844 under the title \\"Novellen und Erz√§hlungen\\" (\\"Novellas and stories\\"). One critic found it \\"very entertaining, full of life and action\\". One of her novels, \\"Die beiden Gra√üel\\" (\\"The two Grassels\\"), reached no fewer than five editions, and a stage adaptation of it which she herself wrote then in 1848 ran for eighty evenings without a break. She became progressively more creative and prolific as a dramatist, and also found time to adapt English and French novels along with other frequently colourful sources, producing probably more than fifty lively and effective stage works pieces, though at least one serious commentator believed that her output was devoid of artistic worth. A flavour of her output can be gleaned from the titles of some of the productions of her plays: * \\"Ein gebrochenes Wort. Volksst√ºck\\" (loosely, \\"A broken promise. Popular piece\\"): Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna, 17 September 1859 * \\"Die Armen und Elenden, Bilder aus dem franz√∂sischen Volksleben\\" (loosely, \\"The poor and destitute, images from French common life\\" - based on Les Mis√©rables by Victor Hugo): Thalia Theatre in Vienna, 29 May 1863 * \\"Novara.

Ancient Tur Shimon, mentioned twice in classical Hebrew literature (Jerusalem Talmud, Ta'anit 4:5 and Midrash Rabba, Aicha Rabba 2:5.)Being an exposition of the verse in Lamentations 2:2, \\"The Lord has swallowed up; He has not pitied\\"., has been tentatively identified by archaeologist Boaz Zissu with Khirbet Sammunieh, based on a comparison of the name Tur Shimon with two given Arabic names. In maps of the British Mandate period, the ruin is also named Khirbet et-Tantura. Archaeologists have proposed that this name embodies the Aramaic concept of \\"mountain\\" = Tur. In older PEF maps of Conder and Kitchener, the name of the ruin is given as Sammunieh, a name reminiscent of the Hebrew name Shimon. A riverine brook that flows immediately beneath the mountain has also the appellation of Wadi Isma ªin, thought too to be a corruption of the name Shimon. The productivity of the region is highlighted in a rabbinic reminiscence of its past and where it is said that the inhabitants of Tur Shimon would put out each week 300 sealed jars of summer produce. > In the summer, Tur Shimon would put out three-hundred jars [of produce]In > the variant readings of this text in the Jerusalem Talmud, the word used for > the content of these jars is marqoa ª, explained by the commentary Etz Yosef > as meaning \\"wine\\" (based on the Aramaic Targum in Jeremiah 13:12, and where > such jars were used only for wine), but explained by the author of Sefer > Arukh to mean \\"wicker baskets of shredded left-over bread to be given to the > poor.\\" Others have explained that the jars contained cakes of figs. each > Friday, and why was it destroyed? Some say because of lechery, but others > say because they would play with a ball [on the Sabbath day]. Archaeologist Boaz Zissu, who conducted an archaeological survey of the site during the years 1992‚Äì1997 for the Israel Antiquities Authority, thought the town to date back to Simon the Hasmonaean in the 2nd century BCE, who was known for building fortresses, and after whom the mountain is thought to have been named (lit. \\"Mount Simon\\"). The fortress continued to be inhabited until the Bar Kokhba revolt under Hadrian, when it was destroyed.Zissu (2004), pp. 14, 18 A second survey of the site was conducted in 2001 by a second team. The site, however, has yet to be excavated. Description Tur Shimon rises abruptly above sea level, conspicuous among the mountains as it rises up from the riverbed of the Nahal Sorek Nature Reserve in the form of a conical shaped mountain. The hilltop ruin is covered with brushwood and wild growth, ashlars, a partially standing wall of field stones, razed structures, and large rock- cut cisterns. The entire grounds are strewn with fragments of ancient pottery. Near the summit are six large water reservoirs, hewn in bedrock and plastered. On the northeastern slope of the ruin is a tunnel measuring c. 80 meters long, ending in a rock-hewn pit with niches resembling a columbarium (dovecote). On the southwest slope of the mountain are seen other traces of the town's material culture: a columbarium carved into the rock, a lime pit for burning limestone, a cistern and a wine press. Access to the ruin is easiest on its south, southwestern quarter, on account of its steep declivities on all other sides which render it nearly inaccessible. At its top, there is a slight spur extending to its north, on which leveled field part of the village was formerly built. Together with the higher elevated part they comprise about 15 dunams (3.7 acres).Zissu (2004), p. 8 The mountain is built like a natural fortress. Below it to its southeast, in close proximity, is the ruin Khirbet Deir esh-Sheikh. Lt. Conder, describing the terrain which he saw in July of 1881, wrote: \\"Riding down the great gorge which, under various names, runs down from near Gibeon to Beth Shemesh, we gradually ascended the southern slopes in the vicinity of the little ruined village of Deir esh Sheikh. Before us was a notable peaked knoll of Khurbet Samm√ªnieh, a conspicuous feature of the view, etc. ‚Ä¶[the slopes] to the south were clothed with a dense brushwood of lentisk, arbutus, oak, hawthorn, cornel, khar√ªb, and other shrubs, while in the open glades the thyme, sage, citus (sic), and bell√¢n carpetted (sic) the ledges with a thick fragrant undergrowth.\\" Conder (1881), pp. 264‚Äì265 Lt. Conder goes on to surmise that the knoll of Kh. Sammunieh could have been Kirjath Jearim or Baal, or even Gibeah, seeing that the Camp of Dan was located directly to their west.Conder (1881), pp. 265‚Äì266 In another description, where he describes more closely the pinnacle of the hill-top, without the lower spur in its northern quarter, he writes: \\"Khurbet Sammunieh. Square foundations and cisterns. On the hill-top is a foundation measuring 23 feet north and south, 16 feet east and west. It is filled with rubbish. A stone with a draft 3 inches wide was observed in it. About 60 or 70 yards to the south is a rock-hewn cistern, 12 feet deep, 15 feet square, etc., etc.\\"Conder & Kitchener (1883), p. 124. He names a well located to the south of the ruin, called Bir es Salib, cut in rock, 2¬Ω feet square with a trough to the west, 5 feet by 10 feet. =Access= The main entrance to the site is accessed by foot-paths leading down into the Sorek valley from off regional highway 3866, near moshav Nes Harim. Conder and Kitchener who visited the valley in the late 19th century under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund noted that a branch of an ancient Roman road passed alongside the mountain on its southern side, leading from Bethlehem to Beth- shemesh.Zissu (2004), p. 7 Age of fortress Some 45% of the sherds examined on the mountain proved to be from the Hellenistic period, while another 35% of sherds examined showed evidence of being from the early Roman period. The remaining sherds were shown to be from the Iron Age III (12%), and from the Byzantine era (8%).Zissu (2004), p. 11 Gallery File:Tur Shimon - Kh. Sammunieh.jpgTur Shimon - Kh.

Forming on November 5 as a low pressure system over the Gulf of Thailand, the system crossed through Southern Thailand and the Malay Peninsula and eventually crossed into the Andaman Sea. The weak system intensified into a depression over the Bay of Bengal on November 10 and further intensified to a cyclonic storm on November 11, being classified 'Gaja'. After tracking west- southwestward for a number of days in the Bay of Bengal, Gaja made landfall in South India, shifted through Vedaranyam, Voimedu, Thiruthuraipoondi, Muthupet, Pudukkottai, Adirampattinam, Pattukkottai and Peravurani. The storm survived its crossing into the Arabian Sea; however, it dissipated in hostile conditions only a few days later. 45 people were killed by the storm in that Thanjavur district pattukkotai alone 8 were killed. Gaja had severe impacts in South India, particularly in Tamil Nadu. After Cyclone Gaja, Tamil Nadu sought Rs 15,000 crore from Centre to rebuild. coconut trees of Pattukkottai and Peravurani. Meteorological history On November 5, a low pressure system formed over the Gulf of Thailand. The system crossed through Southern Thailand and the Malay Peninsula on November 8. The next day, it crossed into the Andaman Sea and lingered there, organizing further throughout the day and intensified into a depression over the Bay of Bengal on November 10. The next day, the system was designated by the IMD as BOB 09. Soon after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). At 00:00 UTC on November 11, the deep depression strengthened into a cyclonic storm, and was given the name Gaja by the IMD. After tracking west- southwestward for a number of days, it made landfall near Nagapattinam in southern India, early on November 16 as a Very severe cyclonic storm. Afterward, Gaja passed through Vedaranyam, Voimedu, Muthupet, Pattukotai, Adirampattinam, and Mallipattinam, on the same day. The storm survived crossing over into the Arabian Sea later that day and continued moving westward; however, it degenerated into a remnant low in hostile conditions only several days later, on November 20. Late on the next day, the storm's remnants dissipated near Socotra. Preparation, impacts and aftermath Due to the possibility of adverse effects in the coastal regions of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, early steps were taken by the state governments. About 80,000 were evacuated to 470 relief camps from the districts which were vulnerable to the cyclone in Tamil Nadu. Holidays were also announced in the coastal districts of the Cauvery delta region in Tamil Nadu as well as Puducherry. People were advised not to come out of the house, as the cyclone caused high winds. Preventative measures were explained through all media. At the time of landfall of the cyclone, heavy winds of about 175‚Äì180 km/h speed were experienced. The highest wind gust was recorded in Adhirampattinam at 181 km/h, and Muthupet recorded a wind gust of 180 km/h. Regions of Karaikal and Nagapattinam also experienced 100 km/h winds. The affected areas were the districts of Nagappattinam, Thanjavur, Thiruvarur, Pudukottai, Karaikal, Trichy and Ramanathapuram. About 100,000 electric poles, 1,000 transformers, 201 electricity substations and 5,000 boats were destroyed by the cyclone.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/donations-pour-tn-aftermath- cyclone-gaja-91964 Thousands of cattle and birds died due to the cyclone. 45 people died, mostly in the districts of Thiruvarur, Thanjavur, and Pudukottai.

The area, in the district Allach-Untermenzing, covers 7,13 hectares and was declared a landscape conservation area in 1964. The oak and hornbeam forest is a remnant of the former Lohwaldg√ºrtel north of Munich. Lochholz is part of the KulturGeschichtsPfad Allach-Untermenzing (Munich culture-history path Allach- Untermenzing).  History  Lochholz was a part of the Allach municipality as a community forest. Like all oak and hornbeam forests, the Lochholz was once economically important. Oak bark, the so-called Lohe (tan), was used for the tanning of skins, and from which the name Lo(c)hholz derives. Wood was used for building and as firewood, leaves as litter for the cattle shed. In the course of agricultural reforms of the 18th century, the communal forest was divided. The inhabitants of Allach could now acquire portions of the Lochholz; even today, part of the forest is privately owned. The municipalities own share of 6.67 day work, according to another source 6.02 day work, passed in 1938 with the incorporation of Allachs in the possession of the city of Munich. From the mid-1930s, the Allacher colonization moved into the forest and it was partially built upon. During the Second World War, bunkers and barracks were built in the forest. Displaced persons lived in the barracks after the war. The barracks were demolished and the bunkers filled, but are still recognizable as hills. In 1964, the area was declared a landscape conservation area. In the sense of ecological forestry, forestry intervention is not permitted.  Protection reasoning  The forest is particularly worthy of protection as: * Retreat area for many birds and rare plants * Recreation area and adventure world especially for children, including the surrounding kindergartens * Connecting element between Allacher Forst and Aubinger Lohe * Groundwater storage and air filters for the environment * Testimony of the district history  References  External links  * Eintrag zum Lochholz (ID 395562) auf der World Conservation Monitoring Centre Protected landscapes in Germany Tourist attractions in Munich Culture in Munich ","title":"Lochholz"},{"id":"59074762","text":"The Mountains are Smoking (in ) is a novel by the Polish and Ukrainian writer Yaroslav Halan written in Polish in 1938.

He is best known today for his seminal Riwajat Semarang, 1416‚Äì1931, a historical overview of Semarang's Chinese community. He is cited by some as the first peranakan Chinese historian to write in Malay using the 'modern' historical method.Suryadinata, Leo, ed. Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume I & II. Vol. 1. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2012. p.581 Biography Born in 1895 in Parakan, Central Java, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), Liem Thian Joe received his earliest education at local Malay and Javanese schools. He subsequently attended a Hokkien school for ten years, then the Tiong Hoa Hak Tong in Ngadirejo, a school founded and run by the Confucian organization Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan. Despite his talent for writing, Liem initially worked as a trader in Ngadirejo. He began his writing career in the early 1920s as a journalist for Warna Warta, a Semarang daily, and possibly also for the Batavia-based newspaper Perniagaan. In the early 1930s, Liem joined the editorial board of another Semarang daily Djawa Tengah and its sister monthly Djawa Tengah Review. Around the same time, Liem began - in 1938 - to edit yet another Semarang monthly, Mimbar Melajoe, and also contributed to the prominent, Batavia-based weekly Sin Po. Liem wrote Riwajat Semarang as a series of articles for Djawa Tengah Review from March 1931 until July 1933, before having it published in book form by Ho Kim Yoe in 1933. In the book, he coined the term Cabang Atas, Malay for 'upper branch', to describe the baba bangsawan or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia. Riwajat Semarang, while focused on the history of Semarang's Chinese community, is also an invaluable source for the history of Central Java, particularly of Semarang, since Liem was still able to access the now lost archives of the Kong Koan (or the 'Chinese Council') of Semarang, the city's peak Chinese government body. He is also the anonymous author of Boekoe Peringetan Tiong Hoa Siang Hwee 1907-1937, an anniversary book of Semarang's Chinese Chamber of Commerce, published in 1937. Liem's other historical works include Pusaka Tionghoa of 1952 and the unpublished Riwajat Kian Gwan, a history of Southeast Asia's largest conglomerate at the time, Kian Gwan, completed in 1959. Liem died in Semarang in February 1962.

His body was found on November 13, 2018 by the locals in the Dur Baba District of Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, close to the Torkham border crossing. His postmortem report revealed he had no marks of bullet injury but was rather killed by excessive torture during captivity. He was kept hungry and thirsty for several days, and his legs and arms were broken. He had died a few days before his corpse was found. Some Pakistani officials including the Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor expressed concerns for a possible involvement of foreign hands behind the murder. A joint investigation team was formed by the government to probe the murder. However, Tahir's family, as well as the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, rejected that investigation team, and demanded that the murder should be rather investigated through an international commission, since the case involved two countries. The family also accused the Pakistani government of making no serious efforts to recover Tahir while he was missing for more than two weeks.  Personal life  Tahir belonged to the Dawar tribe of the Pashtuns. He was born in 1968 in the Khadi village of Mir Ali Subdivision in North Waziristan, Pakistan. He got married in 1988 and had five daughters and two sons. Besides his own family, Tahir also helped in raising several other children at his village in North Waziristan and financially supported three widows. Education and career Tahir completed his secondary education in Eidak, a village west of Mir Ali on the periphery of Miramshah, the capital city of North Waziristan. He completed his bachelor's degree in 1989 in Miramshah and started his career in nursing and teaching in North Waziristan. =Police career in Bannu= In 1995, he joined the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police as assistant sub-inspector in Bannu. He continued his studies while working in the Police and completed his master's degree in Pashto in 1997. He was appointed as station house officer at a police station in Bannu in 1998. He was promoted as sub-inspector in 2002 and as inspector in 2007. He was posted to Morocco and Sudan as part of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in 2003 and 2005, respectively. While posted in Bannu, he suffered gunshot wounds to his arm and leg during an encounter with militants in 2005. He narrowly survived two suicide attacks by the Taliban in 2007 and 2009, in the latter of which he was wounded. He received the Quaid-i- Azam Police Medal, the highest award for a police officer in Pakistan, due to his dedication with his job. =Federal Investigation Agency= In March 2009, Tahir was transferred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), a border control and counterintelligence security agency in Pakistan. He worked at FIA as an Assistant Director in Peshawar. He was also sent to Australia and Romania as part of his duty. However, after his stint with FIA at Bacha Khan International Airport, Peshawar, he left it in July 2013. =Police career in Peshawar= Tahir rejoined the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police in July 2013 and served as deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Crime Circle Peshawar, DSP Capital City Police Office, and DSP Faqeerabad Peshawar. He was promoted as superintendent of police (SP) Rural Circle Peshawar in August 2018, just two months before his disappearance. =Political views= Tahir had sympathy for the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM). When Mohsin Dawar, who is one of the leaders of PTM, won his seat in the 2018 general elections to represent North Waziristan in the National Assembly of Pakistan, Tahir said: ‚ÄúThe people of Waziristan have hope that Mohsin Dawar will honor the right of representation and will take the voice of the oppressed to the assembly, whose fury the assembly‚Äôs mic will perhaps be unable to withstand.‚Äù In an old video which went viral on social media after his death, Tahir was seen addressing a group protesters, and arguing that India, the United States, and Afghanistan were behind many conspiracies against Pakistan in general and Peshawar in particular. He said that the Indian intelligence agency RAW, the US CIA, and Afghanistan posed threats to Pakistan, and the focus of their activities was to target the China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor.  Abduction and murder  On October 26, 2018, Tahir was abducted from Islamabad, Pakistan, where he had arrived the same day from Peshawar to attend a meeting. According to Tahir's brother Ahmaduddin: ‚ÄúAt 6:30pm [October 26], Tahir talked to his wife in Peshawar and told her that he was in Islamabad and may return if the meeting is over soon, otherwise he would be coming back on Saturday [October 27]. However, at 7:15pm [October 27], his wife received a text message that Tahir was in Sarai Alamgir near Jhelum.‚Äù On October 28, Tahir's brother Farhan Ahmed lodged an FIR on behalf of Tahir with the Ramna police station in Islamabad. The police officials investigating the kidnapping case informed that Tahir had dinner on October 26 at his residence in Islamabad, then he went out alone on foot at around 7pm, and his mobile phone was found to be switched off from around 8pm. Geo-fencing of his mobile phone and number revealed that his last location before being kidnapped was at G-10/4 area of Islamabad. On October 27, his mobile phone was switched on at a location in Sarai Alamgir, then switched off again, after which there was no trace of his mobile phone or SIM card. The Pakistani Prime Minister's spokesman Iftikhar Durrani, in an interview with Voice of America on October 28, laughed away Tahir's kidnapping report, and stated that Tahir was not abducted but was safe in Peshawar; Iftikhar Durrani's statement later turned out to be wrong. The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) protested against the abduction of Tahir during their public gathering on October 28 in Bannu. On November 7, Tahir's family and elders of the Dawar tribe from Waziristan demanded that Tahir should be recovered immediately, threatening to organize protest sit-ins in Islamabad and Peshawar for his recovery. On November 13, i.e. 18 days after Tahir's disappearance, his tortured dead body was found about 100 meters away from the Durand Line, in the Dur Baba District of the province of Nangarhar, Afghanistan. He was buried the same day at a cemetery in the Momand Dara area in Nangarhar, after the washing and shrouding of his body and performing the Islamic funeral prayer for him. On November 14, Tahir's body was exhumed from the cemetery in Momand Dara, and carried to Jalalabad to conduct a postmortem examination on it on the order of Hayatullah Hayat, Governor of Nangarhar. The body would subsequently be carried from Jalalabad to Peshawar, Pakistan. At first, a tribal jirga in Nangarhar refused to hand over Tahir's body to Pakistani authorities, but after some delay and negotiation, they agreed. On November 15, the body was received at the Torkham border crossing between Nangarhar and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by a tribal jirga led by the Pakistani parliamentarian Mohsin Dawar. Pakistan's State Minister of Interior Shehryar Afridi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Information Minister Shaukat Yousafzai were also present at the jirga in Torkham. The same day, separate Islamic funeral prayers were reperformed for Tahir at Police Lines Peshawar and Hayatabad, Peshawar, and then he was buried at a cemetery in Hayatabad. Shehryar Afridi, Pakistan's State Minister of Interior, stated during his speech at the Senate of Pakistan that Tahir was shifted from Islamabad to Nangarhar through northern Punjab, Mianwali, and Bannu. He said: \\"SP Tahir was transported from Islamabad to Punjab, where he was kept for a couple of days. Then he stayed in Mianwali for three to four days, and then he was taken to Bannu.\\" Shehryar Afridi also complained that at least 600 of the 1800 surveillance cameras installed under the Safe City Project in Islamabad were not working and that not one camera could read a vehicle's number plate or a person's face. =Responsibility= The authorities in Islamabad initially said that the Pakistani Taliban abducted Tahir, but the Pakistani Taliban denied involvement. In a Pashto note handwritten on a blank piece of paper, which was reportedly placed on the chest of the dead body of Tahir, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ‚Äì Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) claimed responsibility of the murder. However, there was no official claim of responsibility from Amaq Agency, the news outlet linked to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Some political analysts, journalists, and activists have questioned the authenticity of the handwritten note found besides the body, arguing that ISIL makes its official claims through Amaq Agency, not in this manner. Mohsin Dawar, who represents North Waziristan in the National Assembly of Pakistan and is one of the leaders of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, was also unconvinced. Mohsin Dawar accused the Pakistani military of being an accomplice in the murder, and said: ‚ÄúFor more than 15 years, we have seen this deceptive drama that people are murdered and then their corpses are left with a note from militants. We will not be deceived. How was he taken from Islamabad?‚Äù Calling for an international commission to investigate the murder case rather than investigating it internally, Mohsin Dawar said: \\"We reject an internal inquiry. We know that our investigation authorities can‚Äôt question certain powers.\\" On the other hand some other Pakistani officials, on condition of anonymity, claimed that the Afghan intelligence agency carried out Tahir's murder. =Reactions=Pakistani government Imran Khan, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, condemned the murder and called it a shocking tragedy. He ordered its immediate inquiry and tasked Pakistan's State Minister of Interior Shehryar Afridi to oversee it. The Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor also condemned the murder. Hinting at a broader involvement of foreign powers behind the case, Asif Ghafoor said: ‚Äú[Tahir's] abduction, move to Afghanistan, murder and follow up behavior of Afghan authorities raises questions, which indicate involvement or resources more than a terrorist organization in Afghanistan.‚Äù Afghan government Omar Zakhilwal, Afghanistan's ambassador in Islamabad, expressed grief over the case and asked the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan to sit together and talk about who would have murdered Tahir. He promised that the Afghan government would investigate the case. Pashtun Tahafuz Movement Supporters of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) held protest rallies in several cities of Pakistan and demanded for an international commission to investigate the case. They chanted slogans against Pakistan Army and Pakistani intelligence agencies, whom they accused to be involved in the abduction and murder. Mohsin Dawar, who is one of the leaders of PTM and also represents North Waziristan in the National Assembly of Pakistan, expressed shock over Tahir's murder and said: ‚ÄúExplaining this in the same old ‚Äògood‚Äô and ‚Äòbad‚Äô Taliban drama will not work anymore. The State of Pakistan is responsible for his martyrdom and we demand answers. His abductors have to be made answerable.‚Äù Opposition parties in Pakistan Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party's leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai equated the murder of Tahir with Jamal Khashoggi, saying \\"both incidents required international probe.\\" Awami National Party held protest rallies in several cities across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and backed the demand of PTM to call for an international inquiry. Qaumi Watan Party also protested against the murder and demanded for an early arrest of the killers. Pakistan Muslim League (N) and Pakistan Peoples Party criticized the government of Pakistan for failing to provide security to Tahir in the capital Islamabad. Package for Tahir's family Imran Khan, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, approved a package of Rs70 million for Tahir's family. Tahir's poetry Tahir wrote poetry in Pashto language. Some of his ghazals have been sung by local singers with music. The following Pashto poem is an example of his poetry, in which he lamented for his war-torn homeland, Waziristan: See also *Killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud *Arman Loni *List of kidnappings *List of people who disappeared *Mohsin Dawar *Malik Saad *Safwat Ghayur *Waziristan  References  1968 births 2010s missing person cases 2018 deaths Formerly missing people found dead Missing person cases in Afghanistan Missing person cases in Pakistan Pashtun people Pakistani police officers People from North Waziristan Pashto-language poets ","title":"Tahir Dawar"},{"id":"59075193","text":"The Association of Art and Antique Dealers (also known as LAPADA, for its former name: London and Provincial Antique Dealers Association) is the largest UK trade association of art and antiques dealers.https://lapada.org/what-is- lapada/ See also * ReferencesExternal links * 1974 establishments in the United Kingdom Retail trade associations ","title":"The Association of Art and Antique Dealers"},{"id":"59075197","text":"Barmaid () is a 1922 German silent film directed by Johannes Guter and starring Xenia Desni, Paul Hartmann, and Charlotte Ander.Hardt p. 226 The film's sets were designed by the art director Erich Czerwonski.

Life Annette Elizabeth Mahon was born in Dublin on 21 October 1918. She was one of six children. Her father worked in the Post Office. Mahon attended a Sacred Heart convent in Dublin and went on to get a job with an accountancy firm until the war. During her childhood in Dublin there had been a visit from Sir Alan Cobham's Flying Circus and Mahon had taken a ride and for a moment been given control of the airplane. When the war began Mahon moved to Northern Ireland to drive ambulances with the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in Ulster. There she heard about the Air Transport Auxiliary and in 1942 she applied for the ATA pilot training. She was accepted and was sent to the Elementary Flying Training School at Prestwick in Scotland. She was posted to Prestwick once training was complete and ferried planes around the north of Scotland. She gained the name ‚ÄúQueen of the Barracudas‚Äù when she began flying Fairey Barracudas regularly after they entered service in 1943. She was very fond of the aircraft. During the war she flew 12 different aircraft, including Spitfires and got 475 hour flying time. Although Mahon predominately worked as a stay at home mother after the war, in 1973 she volunteered with the group that became the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford, Gloucestershire. Personal life She met her husband, Dr Maurice Hill while in Prestwick. She became ill with influenza and being in a foreign country she had no one to look after her. Hill took care of her for the duration and she later took him flying in her Barracuda and told him he was going to marry her. They were married in 1947 in London. Hill took a job with the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority so Mahon moved around the UK with him from Cumbria to Caithness and Hampshire. They had three daughters though one, Elizabeth, died young in 1966. Her husband had a stroke and died in 1996. Mahon died 7 October 2013.

History =130 Cumberland Street= Occupation on this site is known from when George Cribb constructed a row of tenements along Cumberland Street to Longs Lane. These were demolished and replaced by a row of single-storey terraces around 1834. The first recorded grant was to Benjamin Ford in January 1839 and the site of No. 130 was then known as Allotment 10, Section 74, comprising 2.5 perches.NSW Government Gazette, 18 January 1839. In 1845, the City Council noted the building on Allotment 10 was a two-room brick and stone house with shingled roof in \\"middling repair\\". The \\"date of taking\\" is noted as 1833 which may imply a date of construction, or earlier assessment by the Town Surveyor. The tenant in this year and until was the owner, Benjamin Ford, described as either a dealer or a cooper.Sands Directory Between 1845 and , the date of demolition, the building was described as a letted \\"shop\\" or \\"house and shop\\" of brick and/or stone construction. In 1861 Council noted that the \\"floor (was) under (the) footpath\\". In 1888 the present building on the site was erected as a speculative venture (owner not determined) and was first tenanted by William McGee, tobacconist. It was described by Council in 1891 as a three-storey seven-room brick house with iron roof. Magee resided in the house until 1895. In 1903 the land and building were resumed by the NSW Government under The Rocks Resumption Act, 1901. The building at No. 130 remained tenanted as a residence until 1976. In the 1980s the building was boarded up. For the next ten years, the building was intermittently occupied by squatters and a period of vandalism ensued during which much of the joinery and many of the fixtures were stolen. The timbers were subject to termite activity during this time. The original plan of the building has remained intact together with some of the original architectural detailing.SCRA, 1984: CU/04Clive Lucas Stapleton, 1991 The Sydney Cove Authority undertook extensive work in the precinct in the mid 1990s.

The work involved the retention of as much of the significant fabric as possible from the various stages of the buildings' lives, and was carried out in a number of stages from 1992-97.Mountstephens, 1997 The conservation work carried out on the Long's Lane precinct won the Royal Australian Institute of Architects 1998 Lloyd Rees Award for Outstanding Urban Design. =132-134 Cumberland Street= In 1807, this site is shown on Meehan's Survey to contain what appears to be a well defined building line. Artists' views of this section of The Rocks from confirm a cluster of modest houses in the region. However, in 1822, the date of Harper's Plan, only one building outline is apparent in this section of Cumberland Street. Occupation on this site is known from when George Cribb constructed a row of tenements along Cumberland Street to Longs Lane. These were demolished and replaced by a row of single-storey terraces around 1834. The first official land grant on the site of 132-134 Cumberland Street (referred to as Allotment 11 of Section 74, comprising 4.5 perches, in the Land Title records), was a Town Grant to Isaac Moore in January 1839. Moore had purchased the two adjoining dwelling houses on this allotment in 1833 from a John Jones. These dwellings were built prior to the first Council Rates being collected in 1845, at which time the houses were described as single- storey stone dwellings with two rooms apiece. These adjoining houses were pulled down in 1880, and the land remained vacant until at least 1891. The existing conjoined two-storey terraces were constructed in the early 1890s; according to the Council Rates records, they were two-storey, five-room brick and cement dwellings with iron rooves. 132-134 Cumberland Street remained in continuous family ownership from 1833 until their resumption by the NSW Government in the early 1900s. The first owner, Isaac Moore, was the brother- in-law of Edward Brady (owner -1867) and his niece was Mary Ann Smith, n√©e Brady (owner -1902). Moore sold to Edward Brady in 1840, according to Land Title records. On Brady's death in 1869, his will stipulated that Isaac Moore's sons, Edmund, William and Thomas Moore were trustees and were required to provide for Mary Ann Smith during her life, and for her children after death. Much of the land and many of the buildings in The Rocks, including the subject properties, were resumed by the NSW Government under The Darling Harbour Resumption Act in the early 1900s. The buildings at Nos. 132-134 Cumberland remained tenanted as residences until the 1970s. The buildings were boarded up in the 1980s, and for the next ten years, squatters intermittently occupied the buildings, and a period of vandalism ensued during which much of the joinery and many of the fixtures were stolen. It is likely that the timbers were subject to termite activity during this time.

The work involved the retention of as much of the significant fabric as possible from the various stages of the buildings' lives. =136-138 Cumberland Street= In 1807, this site is shown on Meehan's Survey to contain what appears to be a well defined building line in Cumberland Street - its western boundary, and a lane to the south. Artists' views of this part of Sydney from confirm a large number of small houses in the region. Occupation on this site is known from when George Cribb constructed a row of four tenements along Cumberland Street to Longs Lane. These were demolished and replaced by a row of single-storey terraces around 1834). The first official land grant on the site of Nos. 136-138 Cumberland Street (referred to as Allotment 12 of Section 74, comprising 4.5 perches, in the Land Title records), was a Town Grant to Thomas Garrard on 19 April 1839. There were originally two adjoining dwelling houses on this allotment (possibly the Cribb terraces referred to above). These two buildings/dwellings had been erected prior to the first Council Rates being collected in 1845, at which time they were described as single- storey stone houses with two rooms apiece. The two buildings at Nos. 136-138 Cumberland Street remained in continuous family ownership from 1833 until 1876, when they were sold to Richard Egan. He in turn sold to local resident and entrepreneur, John Johnson in , who oversaw construction of the existing building on the site. The two stone buildings at Nos. 136-138 Cumberland Street were \\"pulled down\\" by according to Council Rates records for this year. The existing building on the site was constructed by 1882; according to the rates records, it was a three-storey commercial building (a shop) with residential quarters above. The building was brick with an iron roof and had ten rooms. John Johnson sold the new three-storey building to Kellas Watson, a draper, in . Johnson had made a healthy profit on his investment; in 1880 Egan sold the land at Nos. 136-138 Cumberland Street to Johnson for ¬£525. The following year, in August 1882, Johnson sold to Watson for ¬£1800. Johnson's brief ownership of the site, during which time he built a substantial building, suggests that this was a speculative investment. Kellas Watson was an owner-occupier, and it is possible that he operated a drapery shop on the site. Watson sold the property to Henry Edward Castle, Sydney, commercial broker, in late . Thereafter the shop was used as a shop, leased to Frederick Smith, butcher (-87) and King Hing and Co. (1888‚Äì90). Peter. A. Nelson ran a boarding house in the building from to .PWD, 1986: 14 Much of the land and many of the buildings in The Rocks, including the subject property, were resumed by the NSW Government under The Darling Harbour Resumption Act in the early 1900s.

The work involved the retention of as much of the significant fabric as possible from the various stages of the buildings' lives. =140-142 Cumberland Street= Early plans and images, such as Watling's (attrib.) painting Sydney - Capital New South Wales and Meehan's 1807 Plan of Sydney Town show that present-day Cumberland Street between Essex and Argyle Streets was closely settled along a defined building alignment. These dwellings are likely to have been flimsy timber houses, built by the occupants (convicts and free settlers). The earliest reference to Long's Lane is made in Meehan's 1807 map, where the present day lines of Cumberland and Gloucester Streets are shown to have been formed with an interconnection along the alignment of Long's Lane. Development within the precinct occurred predominantly in the 1880s and in the first decades of the 20th century. This property includes part of allotment 18 of section 74, along with 113-115 Gloucester Street, which was formally granted to William Long in 1839, legitimising his claim to ownership of the property. Previous to this, Long had assumed de facto ownership of the western section of allotment 18, fronting Cumberland St, upon the passing of Mary, his wife of two years, in 1829. Mary had owned the property since the death of her former husband, Richard Walker in 1825. A former convict, Long arrived in Sydney aboard the Baring in 1815, but by 1829 was a successful wine and spirits merchant as well as being licensee of pubs in and Lower George Street. In June 1830, Long advised the Colonial Secretary of his plans for the land adjacent Long's Lane: 'On this allotment I intend to have erected within six months from the present date (most of the foundations being now laid) 'ten handsome cottages the value of which when complete have seen estimates of ¬£3000'. In the rate assessment book of 1845, this row is described as a group of eight brick single-storey tenements with shingle roofs, containing two rooms each. By 1845, a two- storey, three room building with a shingled roof had been erected upon the site at the corner of Long's Lane and Cumberland Street, possibly on the site of two of Long's 1830 tenements. The building was variously described as a house, a shop, or a pub, having either seven or eight rooms. The pub was known as the Erin-go-Bragh ('Ireland for Ever') from 1871, with a name change to the Emerald between 1879 and 1882. Until 1853 the landlord for the property was James Wright, the trustee for Long's daughter Isabella. Wright was the proprietor of the Australian Brewery at the corner of Bathurst and George Streets, Sydney. In 1853 Long's daughter Isabella married James Martin, who subsequently became the registered owner of the property. Martin later served as Chief Justice of the NSW Supreme Court, was the Premier of New South Wales on three separate occasions, and is the person after whom Martin Place is named. By 1882 the rate assessment books indicate that the pub had grown to contain between ten and fourteen rooms. A map dated to 1887 confirms that the building had undergone further alterations earlier in the previous decade. An extension to the pub was built at 142 Cumberland Street at this time, and mainly used as hairdresser's shop. Following an outbreak of the Bubonic plague in Sydney and The Rocks the NSW Government, under The Rocks Resumption Act (1901), resumed the area, which was barricaded to prevent further spread of infection. Some buildings were demolished, and from 1912 the NSW Housing Board began to construct housing in the vacant blocks of land in The Rocks. The Housing Board, founded under the Housing Act 1912, was the first such agency in the state devoted to the construction of public housing. The Board acquired land upon which buildings were constructed to be leased to \\"persons qualified under the Act\\" for business or residential purposes. The Housing Board examined public housing initiatives in the UK and Europe, and incorporated those ideas in constructing tenement dwellings in The Rocks. By 1907 the shop at 142 Cumberland Street and the adjoining building at No. 140 had been demolished. It appears that there was little development on the site over the next five years, but by 1912 the Board had moved to build worker's dwellings in Gloucester, Cumberland and Essex streets. In addition to housing, the Board also sought to ensure a mix of housing, corner shops, pubs and the like in the area. From 1912, the Housing Board built some 30 units in one development along Gloucester, Cumberland and Little Essex streets. In addition to housing, the Board also sought to ensure a mix of housing, corner shops, pubs and the like in the area. The new terraces, including 140-142 Cumberland Street, were built by J. H. Thompson of Bondi to the design of Board architect W. Foggitt. Among the first tenants of the new development at was Mrs Annie Johnson, who operated a \\"residential\\" [boarding house] at No. 142 between 1916 and 1931. Richard Boucher similarly ran a \\"residential\\" at No. 140, from 1925 to 1930. Of this large Housing Board development, only the northern units remain: the building at 117 Gloucester Street, and the subject building at 140-142 Cumberland Street. The buildings demonstrate the typical Housing Board plan form, providing outdoor spaces in balconies and rear yards. Parts of the Gloucester / Essex / Cumberland Streets Housing Board development were demolished in the 1920s to make way for the approaches to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The remainder of the development was demolished with the construction of the Cahill Expressway in the 1950s to make way for the new freeway. 140-142 Cumberland Street continued to be tenanted through the 1970s. The last house was vacated in the 1980s when the house was boarded up. Subsequently, squatters occupied the building. Many fixtures were stolen or demolished during this period, perhaps as a result of boom in house renovations elsewhere in the inner city. Between 1994 and 1995, an extensive programme of conservation works was carried out on the building. The work comprised stabilisation, restoration of the front fa√ßade and roofs, cutting in damp proof courses, and construction of new floors. Joinery, plastering, and other surface finishes were reconstructed on the basis of surviving original fabric. The building is now operated as bed and breakfast accommodation. The Sydney Cove Authority also carried out conservation works to the buildings and rear yards in the remainder of the Long's Lane Precinct, including 113-115 Gloucester Street and 117-117a Gloucester Street.  Description =130 Cumberland Street = 130 Cumberland Street, pictured at right, as the three- storey terrace house, in 1901. The single-storey houses to the left were demolished and now form part of the Cumberland Street Archaeological Site and YHA Sydney Harbour youth hostel. 130 Cumberland Street is a part of the 'Long's Lane Precinct'. Long's Lane is a cluster of nineteenth and early- twentieth houses, rear yards, and laneways between Gloucester and Cumberland Streets, The Rocks. 130 Cumberland Street is a three-storey building typical in scale and detail of terrace type buildings erected in the inner suburbs of Sydney during the 1880s. It is built of stuccoed brick with an iron roof, and has moulded string courses and the windows on the two upper levels are round headed. It relates in style to the two and three storey Italianate terraced buildings at Nos132-4 and Nos 136-8 Cumberland Street.Karskens, 1981 Style: Late Victorian Italianate; Storeys: three; Roof cladding: Iron. Archaeological research potential is high.  Modifications and dates  *1920s: The building appears to have been renovated. *1992-97: Conservation and restoration of the Long's Lane precinct. =132-134 Cumberland Street= 132-134 Cumberland Street is a part of the 'Long's Lane Precinct'. Long's Lane is a cluster of nineteenth and early-twentieth houses, rear yards, and laneways between Gloucester and Cumberland Streets, the Rocks. These two- storey residential terraces are typical of the 1880s building style. The two five room terraces are built of stuccoed brick with an iron roofs, and have moulded string courses and arched windows on the upper level. They relate in style to the three-storey Italianate terraced buildings on either side at Nos. 130 and Nos 136-8 Cumberland Street. An unusual feature of this infill development is the reduced scale of the building and set back relative to these two adjoining properties. The set back has allowed the incorporation of a front porch. The incorporation of a central passageway between the two to the rear of the buildings is a relatively rare feature on the terraces of Sydney. Style: Late Victorian Italianate terrace; Storeys: two; Facade: Rendered brick; Roof cladding: Iron. Archaeological potential is high.  Modifications and dates  *1992-97: Conservation and restoration of the Long's Lane precinct. =136-138 Cumberland Street= 136-138 Cumberland Street, the three-storey terrace at left with an awning, pictured in 1901. 136-138 Cumberland Street is a part of the 'Long's Lane Precinct'. Long's Lane is a cluster of nineteenth and early-twentieth houses, rear yards, and laneways between Gloucester and Cumberland Streets, the Rocks. The three- storey corner building is of stuccoed brick with an iron roof. It has moulded string courses and arched windows on the upper two storeys, a moulded coping with decorative corbels and stucco quoins. While this three-storey building is typical of 1880s development in detail and planning, it was intended as a shop and boarding house, which may account for its relatively elaborate detailing. While the original planning of the building remains intact, much of the original architectural detailing, apart from the windows, has been removed. Style: Late Victorian Italianate; Storeys: three; Roof cladding: iron. Archaeological potential: high.  Modifications and dates  *1992-97: Conservation and restoration of the Long's Lane precinct. =140-142 Cumberland Street= 140-142 Cumberland Street is a part of the 'Long's Lane Precinct'. Long's Lane is a cluster of nineteenth and early-twentieth houses, rear yards, and laneways between Gloucester and Cumberland Streets, the Rocks. These buildings are part of the same development as 117-117A Gloucester Street, relating to the NSW Government Housing Board redevelopment of the block bounded by Little Essex (now demolished), Cumberland and Gloucester Streets. Style: Edwardian; Storeys: two.  Condition  As at 21 November 2002, any further ground disturbance on this site should be closely monitored by an archaeologist and in conjunction with a formal research design and knowledge of the results and research design of the 1994 Cumberland/Gloucester Street excavation. Possible archaeological resource.  Modifications and dates  *1992-97: Conservation and restoration of the Long's Lane precinct.  Heritage listing =130 Cumberland Street= As at 27 October 2008, No. 130 Cumberland Street and its site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to the Longs Lane Precinct and The Rocks area as a whole. The relationship between No. 130 Cumberland Street and its neighbours in the Longs Lane Precinct is clear and still within the historic street pattern even though many of its nineteenth century neighbours did not survive the Government twentieth century resumption and improvements. Within the state significant Rocks and Millers Point areas, No. 130 Cumberland Street site is an important survivor from the late nineteenth century which still retains its tenanted residential use and still clearly demonstrates its historic planning particularly with its service areas. No. 130 Cumberland Street exhibits all the key characteristics of a late nineteenth century modest inner city residential terrace. Within the building, the original hierarchy is still clearly expressed with the ground floor formal rooms, first and second floor bedrooms and rear service rooms and the building retains a critical mass of its major fabric and fittings such as its structure, timber stair walls, decorative joinery and fireplace. The fittings and decoration, which date from the 1990s reconstruction work, and the deliberate retention of the building's external weathered patina, heighten the experience of the building's age. The positioning of the terrace on an abrupt sandstone and beton brut plinth formed out the lowering of Cumberland Street has raised the building and its wide bare north wall up as a local landmark in Cumberland Street. Terrace was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Longs Lane Precinct is historically significant as it is indicative of mid nineteenth to early-twentieth century residential development of The Rocks, retaining strong associational and geographic links with adjacent community uses such as shops (Susannah Place), and hotels (The Australian Hotel and others). No. 130 Cumberland Street is a good and mostly intact representative example of a late nineteenth century modest inner city tenanted residential terrace and makes an important contribution to the understanding of the historical development of The Rocks and Millers Point particularly of the areas' resident use. The area, which is now identified with No. 130, is slightly longer than the original 1830s lot, but its narrowness remains as evidence of the density and character of the early nineteenth century subdivisions in The Rocks. The site commenced as a speculative venture in its initial form as an 1840s single-storey two-room house which was replaced by the current 1880s terrace still confined by the 1830s narrow lot. The size of the original lot is testament to how lower quality housing came about in the nineteenth century, mostly built by speculative developers which was let to tenants who were attracted to live in the area because of the proximity to employment within the wharves and related industries. The work undertaken by the then Sydney Cove Authority (subsequently Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority) to sensitively conserve and adapt the precinct and the building and rear yards and retain as much of the significant fabric as possible from the various stages of the buildings' lives added a new contemporary layer reflecting the conservation ethos at the time. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Three families have associations with the Longs Lane precinct as owners/developers: Long, Jobbins and Caraher, each provides an interesting contrast in their approach to the way the different allotments were developed. No. 130 Cumberland Street itself does not have a strong or special association with significant people who are important in NSW or The Rocks' cultural or natural history. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Longs Lane Precinct contributes significantly to the townscape of The Rocks. This significance rests on the ensemble of buildings dating from the mid-nineteenth to early-twentieth centuries, together with associated laneways and rear yards. In Cumberland Street, the 1880s buildings by their geographic isolation present a varied and characterful collection enhanced by the conjunction with Longs Lane which is complemented by the Edwardian style building at 140-142 Cumberland Street. No. 130 Cumberland Street is a good representative example of a modest late nineteenth century terrace with some Italianate pretensions but the residence does not in itself demonstrate a high degree of aesthetic, creative or technical achievement. The building demonstrates mostly modest standards of construction in materials and workmanship. The fittings and decoration, which date from the 1990s reconstruction work, and the deliberate retention of the building's external weathered patina, heighten the experience of the building's age. The positioning of the terrace on an abrupt sandstone plinth formed out the lowering of Cumberland Street almost accidentally raised the building and its wide bare north wall up as a local landmark although the building's north wall has been a local feature since the construction of the terrace. The terrace's former northern neighbour was a single-storey house. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Although The Rocks as a whole is highly valued throughout Australia as a precinct with strong connections to important Australian historical themes, No. 130 Cumberland Street itself does not have strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in NSW or The Rocks area for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Longs Lane Precinct is of prime archaeological significance with its continued European occupation from at least the first quarter of the nineteenth century in a relatively undisturbed state. The Longs Lane Precinct is of educational value to specialists and the general public with its ensemble of nineteenth buildings, laneways and rear yards, and its significance is enhanced by the tangible relationship of the buildings and laneways to the documentary and oral historical information. The archaeological potential of the site of No. 130 Cumberland Street is high and relates to early development of The Rocks as well as late nineteenth and early twentieth century development. No. 130's rear yard corresponds with parts of the former yards of 9-11 Carahers Lane. The significance of this evidence is high. Any subfloor archaeological deposits are a significant resource. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Within The Rocks, No. 130 Cumberland Street site is an important survivor from the late nineteenth century which still retains its residential use and demonstrates its historic planning particularly its service areas. The Longs Lane Precinct dating from the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth centuries which together with its open areas, yards, lanes and footpaths dating from the early nineteenth century is rare in the Sydney Region. Importantly, the relationship between No. 130 Cumberland Street and its neighbours in the Longs Lane Precinct is still clear and unobstructed and still within the historic street pattern. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. No. 130 Cumberland Street is a good intact representative example of a late nineteenth century modest inner city residential terrace. However, the value of No. 130 Cumberland Street as part of the Longs Lane precinct is considered to be rare in New South Wales and are therefore discussed under Criterion F. =132-134 Cumberland Street= As at 11 March 2009, the sites and buildings at Nos. 132-134 Cumberland Street are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values.

Nos. 132-134 Cumberland Street have associations with the Moore - Brady - Smith related families from 1833 until resumed by the Government in 1901. This family is reasonably typical of property owning families in The Rocks who also went to be land owners elsewhere in Sydney, in this case Mosman. These associations are not at the level to be described as strong or special association with significant people who are important in NSW cultural or natural history.

Nos. 136-138 Cumberland Street meets this criterion at a local level. =140-142 Cumberland Street= As at 11 March 2009, this pair of tenements and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Longs Lane precinct is primarily significant as a unique ensemble of nineteenth century residential buildings, laneways and rear yards in The Rocks, and because it includes the terrace, 103-111 Gloucester Street, which is a very rare extant example in Sydney of an early Victorian Greek Revival style terrace of houses created as total composition. Longs Lane precinct is also significant because: It is indicative of the nineteenth and early-twentieth century residential character of The Rocks, retaining strong associational and geographic links with community services such as shops, and churches. It retains rare examples of early-nineteenth century public laneways in their original scale and orientation. It is a unique ensemble in The Rocks of tenanted residential buildings of varying nineteenth and early twentieth century architectural periods including the Early Victorian, Victorian, and Edwardian. It possesses a unique archaeological potential as a discrete cluster of buildings, laneways, and rear yards of various buildings, relatively undisturbed since 1915, dating from the earliest period of occupation in Sydney. Numbers 117-119 Gloucester and 140-142 Cumberland Streets are rare examples of the early-twentieth-century government-built worker's housing project initiated by the Housing Board Act of 1912. Numbers 140-142 are the remaining pair of a larger contemporary group, now demolished, that fronted Cumberland, Little Essex and Gloucester Streets. Longs Lane is a rare extant public right of way known to have existed from the first decade of the nineteenth century. Carahers Lane is a rare documented site where the existence of slum housing from the-mid to late-nineteenth century can be shown to be associated with the remaining physical fabric, and historical documentation about the landlords/owners. 140-142 Cumberland Street is of historical, aesthetic, and scientific significance to the people of New South Wales for its contribution to the Longs Lane precinct which is significant in demonstrating the evolution of The Rocks in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and which remains a rare townscape complete with laneways and rear yards intact. Of aesthetic significance as an example of the public housing tenements constructed by the Housing Board between 1912 and 1924, the building is a valuable example of the Australian Federation architectural style as it was applied to a new building type in the early 20th century. 140-142 Cumberland Street is one of two surviving segments of a much larger housing development which is significantly associated with the Housing Board, the first government agency established solely for the provision of housing. Together with the small number of other Housing Board buildings in The Rocks (including 46-56 Gloucester Street and 117 Gloucester Street), 140-142 Cumberland Street represents the changing role of government in the provision of welfare services to the populace from the turn of the 20th century. Tenements was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. 140-142 Cumberland Street is historically significant as a key component in demonstrating the evolution of the Long's Lane precinct, which is a unique ensemble in The Rocks of 19th and early 20th century residential buildings, laneways, and rear yards. 140-142 Cumberland Street is of historical significance in its own right as one of two surviving fragments remaining from a large public housing scheme fronting Gloucester, Cumberland, and Little Essex Streets. (The second fragment is at 117 Gloucester Street.) The scheme was carried out by the NSW Housing Board, the first agency in NSW to be established solely for the purpose of building and managing public housing. The Housing Board's work in The Rocks reflects the increasing role played by government in the welfare of citizens in the early 20th century. The history of 140-142 Cumberland Street's decline into dereliction, and the occupation of the building by squatters prior to the conservation works of the early 1990s reflect the changing social context of The Rocks over the course of the 20th century. The decision of the State government to restore the building demonstrates the prevailing political will and public funding dedicated to the conservation of heritage in the post-Green Bans period in The Rocks. 140-142 Cumberland Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. 140-142 Cumberland Street is significant as one of a small number of buildings constructed under the Housing Act of 1912 by the NSW Housing Board, the first agency to be established in NSW to deal directly with the provision of public housing. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 140-142 Cumberland Street is of aesthetic significance in showing the Edwardian /Australian Federation architectural style as it was applied to a new building type in the early 20th century. While drawing on public housing models from Europe and the UK, the design of the building emphasises its Australian location in the provision of balconies and the use of Australian motifs such as the waratah incorporated into the plaster vents. The aesthetic value of the building has been revealed and can now be better understood through reconstruction and conservation. 140-142 Cumberland Street makes a substantial contribution to the aesthetic significance of the Long's Lane Precinct as an ensemble of 19th and early 20th century buildings, associated laneways, and rear yards. 140-142 Cumberland Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As part of The Rocks area, 140-142 Cumberland Street is likely to be held in some esteem by the individuals and groups who are interested in Sydney's history and heritage. 140-142 Cumberland Street meets this criterion on a local level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Long's Lane Precinct is of prime archaeological significance with its continued European occupation from at least the first quarter of the nineteenth century in a relatively undisturbed state. The Long's Lane Precinct is of educational value to specialists and the general public with its ensemble of nineteenth buildings, laneways and rear yards, and its significance is enhanced by the tangible relationship of the buildings and laneways to the documentary and oral historical information. 140-142 Cumberland Street is a valuable example of the prevailing architectural style as it was applied to a new building type in the first decades of the 20th century, and has the potential to contribute substantially to the understanding of the evolution of housing, in particular public housing constructed by government agencies, in NSW. The archaeological resource at 140-142 Cumberland Street is of potential research significance complementing the findings of previous archaeological investigations of adjacent sites in order to form a valuable resource for understanding early life in The Rocks area, and in particular the Long's Lane precinct. 140-142 Cumberland Street is of some technical significance as an example of \\"academic\\" conservation work in which reconstructed fabric was strictly based on extant material and constructed in a traditional manner. 140-142 Cumberland Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 140-142 Cumberland Street is one remnant of a much larger development which was demolished in the mid-20th century. Together with 46-56 and 117 Gloucester Street, the building forms a very small group of buildings constructed for public housing by the NSW Housing Board. The Long's Lane Precinct is of significance as an ensemble of 19th and early 20th century buildings, associated laneways, and rear yards which is rare (probably unique) in the Sydney region and NSW. 140-142 Cumberland Street meets this criterion on a local level. The Long's Lane precinct meets this criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. 140-142 Cumberland Street is a good representative example of early-twentieth-century tenement housing within the context of the Long's Lane precinct, itself a significant area in demonstrating the 19th century townscape of The Rocks, complete with intact rear yards and laneways. 140-142 Cumberland Street meets this criterion on a local level. The Long's Lane precinct meets this criterion on a State level.  Gallery  Long%27s_Lane_Precinct_2.jpgLong's Lane, looking from Cumberland Street towards Gloucester Street, pictured in 2019.

Like Deren's previous work, A Study in Choreography for Camera (1945), she explores the use of dance on film through the lens of commentary of societal norms, metamorphosis, and anthropomorphism. The film is notable for its disjointed storytelling and use of slow motion, freeze framing, and unique blend of stage dance and film. Deren became known for her affinity for dance in other subsequent films such as Meditation on Violence, Ensemble for Somnambulists, and Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti. Elinor Cleghorn writes: \\"While she never undertook formal training, she identified as a dancer; but rather than pursuing a career as a performer she made her fascination with dance as cultural expression the focus of her progression as a writer and researcher.\\" Plot Deren's character sits in a room spinning layers of twine in a manner reminiscent of cat's cradle. Dancer #1, played by Christiani, enters the room and begins wrapping up the spool from Deren's hands. Close-up and slow motion highlight intense feeling on Deren's face as she performs the first of the rituals in the film. 'Haughty Woman', played by Nin, looks upon the scene scornfully. We cut to a new scene where Dancer #1 is wearing a black hooded garment and a cross necklace. A crowded room full of people interact through expressive, dance-like movements. As people try to approach her, she moves to avoid them with graceful, evasive maneuvers. As she goes across the room she looks around intently to find someone. She spots Dancer #2, played by Frank Westbrook, at the back of the room. The two meet and lock eyes. Dancer #1 breaks away from Dancer #2 as other women flock around him. She walks among granite structures and statues in seeming confusion. She comes upon Dancer #1 posing atop a pedestal as a statue. She approaches and as he moves, she begins to back away. He slowly chases after her in long, slow, hopping strides across a field. Deren's character runs underneath a pier into the ocean as Dancer #2 looks on. She wades further and further into the water before the film cuts to negatives. They depict a woman sinking down into the water past the screen. The last shot of the movie is Dancer #1 lifting a bride's veil above her head. Analysis Speaking of her inspiration, Deren wrote: \\"A ritual is an action distinguished from all others in that it seeks the realization of its purpose through the exercise of form. In this sense ritual is art; and even historically, all art derives from ritual. In ritual, the form is the meaning. More specifically, the quality of movement is not merely a decorative factor; it is the meaning itself of the movement. In this sense, this film is dance.\\" Furthering Deren's theme on rituals, Moira Sullivan says ritual archetypes in the film are: \\"juxtaposed with images of modernity and frozen matter - freeze frames, statues, bodies ‚Äì are ‚Äòspiritualized‚Äô through movement, similarly how symbolist poetry (one of Deren‚Äôs poetic influences) ‚Äòspiritualized language‚Äô.\\" Deren's character in relation to Christiani's is almost mirror-like, leading film writer Bruce McPherson to write: \\"In Ritual in Transfigured Time, Maya appears as the protagonist‚Äôs counterpart, at once a double of Christiani and her familiar spirit, in a social choreography that moves towards the accomplishment of the protagonist‚Äôs ‚Äòcritical metamorphosis.‚Äô\\" This metamorphosis is further contextualized by writer William C. Wees, who says: \\"...references to water and dance accumulate and gain increasing significance as the film proceeds. Through them a theme of paired opposites becomes apparent. It is suggested by references to Deren's use of positive and negative images: the widow's black gown is transformed (in negative) into a white bridal dress at the end‚Ä¶\\" The personal nature of Deren's work, like her other films, is present in Ritual, as it's said some of the themes throughout are direct links to her life, albeit shrouded in her characteristic muddled storytelling. \\"Deren‚Äôs oeuvre is personal to the extent of being almost autobiographical, clearly stemming from her experience of successive marriages and divorces. But she tried to comprehend and transcend that experience by setting it in a context not of resolution and closure, but of contradiction and assimilation (loss and gain, mourning and restitution, death and survival); the widow, drowned, is also a bride, alive, alone.\\"  References External links * Ritual in Transfigured Time on AllMovie Mayaderen.org 1940s avant-garde and experimental films Experimental film Films directed by Maya Deren American films American black-and-white films ","title":"Ritual in Transfigured Time"},{"id":"59075356","text":"Selepa plumbeata is a moth of the family Nolidae first described by George Hampson in 1912.

It was built during 1881. It is also known as Longs Lane Terraces/Precinct. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In 1807, this site is shown by Meehan's Survey to contain a defined building alignment with a lane on the northern boundary. Artists' views of the western side of Sydney Cove between 1800-1820 confirm a large number of small buildings in the region. By 1822 the site appears on Harper's Survey as containing a single relatively small structure. Robert Russell's Survey in 1838 shows the site as the eastern half of Allotment 18 of Section 74 which was granted to William Long by Governor George Gipps in 1839. In 1829, prior to the formalising of the land claim, Long had acquired the eastern section of the property fronting Gloucester Street. A former convict, Long arrived in Sydney aboard the Baring in 1815, but by 1829 was a successful wine and spirits merchant as well as being licensee of pubs in Millers Point and Lower George Street. Long assumed ownership of the western section of allotment 18 fronting Cumberland St after the death of his wife Mary Walker. Prior to her death, Mary Long had inherited the property from her former husband, Richard Walker, in 1825. Maps of the area drawn in 1823 and 1825 show only one building on the site, but by 1831another building had been erected on the corner of Gloucester St and Long's Lane. This building was probably erected during the course of 1830, although the intended use of the building is unclear. In 1845, when the City Council assessed the site, it was described as containing a small tenement of three houses each of two rooms with shingled roofs. The \\"date of taking\\" this assessment is noted as 1842 and in 1848 they are described as \\"bad repair\\". By 1848 a trio of single-storey, shingle-roofed houses, with two rooms each had been built. Around 1881-1882, the three houses, by now in \\"bad repair\\", were demolished, making way for a pair of two storey-terrace houses, with five rooms each (later expanded to six rooms), and slate roofing. These are the houses that remain on the site today. In addition to the main houses, the rear of the lots contained outbuildings, rear wings and rear yards which extended into land formerly occupied by the demolished Long's Lane tenements, which were last listed in the rate books for 1877. The site continued to be the property of William Long (later part of his estate) until the NSW Government resumed the site in 1900. The houses were always tenanted. One notable tenant of No. 113 was Joseph Law, also known as [Joseph] Ah Chong, a Chinese interpreter reportedly working for the government. Law occupied the house from 1885 to 1902, with his wife, Margaret Gratrix, with whom he had up to 18 children. The 1902 Sands Directory was the last mention of Law as the tenant in the house. The following year his wife Margaret was listed as the tenant. Following the outbreak of bubonic plague in Sydney and The Rocks, the NSW Government, under The Rocks Resumption Act 1901 resumed the area. Local people worked at the task of cleansing, disinfecting, fumigating and lime-washing buildings. Although The Rocks area became synonymous with the plague, only three of the 103 people who died of the plague in Sydney were from The Rocks. Between 1905 and 1915, the buildings on the \\"Dig\\" site were demolished and, in the 1920s, major demolition's took place nearby for the Sydney Harbour Bridge approach. In the 1950s, several houses to the south of Long's Lane were demolished when the Cahill Expressway was constructed. Under state ownership the houses continued to be leased to various tenants until the mid-1980s. About this time the rear wings and outbuildings were demolished, and the buildings boarded up. The buildings were occupied by squatters, and vandalised during this period, falling into a ruinous state by the 1990s, when renovation work commenced. Over 1994 and 1995, an extensive programme of conservation works were carried out on the building. The work comprised stabilisation, restoration of the front fa√ßade and roofs, cutting in damp proof courses, and construction of new floors. Joinery, plastering, and other surface finishes were reconstructed on the basis of surviving original fabric. Rear wings were constructed on the extant footings of the earlier rear wings; however, only the external form of the original rear wings was reconstructed, allowing the interiors to be adapted for modern kitchens and bathrooms. The houses are now privately leased to tenants. The Sydney Cove Authority also carried out conservation works to the buildings and rear yards in the remainder of the Long's Lane Precinct, including 103-111 Gloucester Street, 117 Gloucester Street, and 130-142 Cumberland Street. This work was awarded the 1998 Lloyd Rees Award for Outstanding Urban Design. Archaeology notes: Lease to Samuel Thorley, 8 June 1803 (land later granted as Lot 21, Section 74).

Description  113-115 Gloucester Street is a part of a cluster of nineteenth and early-twentieth houses, rear yards, and laneways between Gloucester and Cumberland Streets, The Rocks. 113-115 Gloucester Street is a typical Victorian terrace of the 1880s prevalent throughout the inner suburbs of Sydney. The dominant feature of the terrace is the large verandah space onto Gloucester Street. While interior planning of the terrace is basically two rooms down and up with rear service wings, an unusual feature is the strict alignment of the building to the land title allotment. A consequence of this is that many of the walls do not meet at ninety degrees. Style: Late Victorian terrace; Storeys: 2; Roof Cladding: Originally slate. = Condition = As at 3 May 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Archaeological excavation (1994) involved the removal of occupation deposits from the kitchens of 113-115, dating from 1881 to s. Deposits in the rest of the properties were untouched with the exception of 300x300 excavations in the centres of each of the four main ground floor rooms in 113-115 for the construction of floor supports. All services were surface mounted beneath floor joists to avoid disturbance of potential archaeological remains. An existing service trench in 117 was re-excavated and utilised for the same purpose. Pre 1912 deposits in 117 untouched. Investigation: Historical research and assessment of archaeology. = Modifications and dates = *1989Rear wings and outbuildings demolished. *1920sReplacement of doors, windows etc. and probable installation of electrical services. *1992-97Conservation and restoration of the Long's Lane precinct.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, this pair of terraces and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The pair of houses at 113-115 Gloucester Street and site are of historical, aesthetic, and scientific significance to the people of New South Wales for its contribution to the Longs Lane precinct which is significant in demonstrating the evolution of The Rocks in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and which remains a rare townscape complete with laneways and rear yards intact. The terrace has aesthetic significance as a typical example of the form of housing prevalent in the inner suburbs of Sydney in the 1880s, 113-115 Gloucester Street possesses the ability to interpret their original appearance and configuration as a result of extensive conservation works undertaken by the State government in the 1990s. Occupied by numerous tenants throughout its history, No. 113 has been identified as a site of heritage significance as the home of a Chinese interpreter, Joseph Law, between 1885 and 1902. The Longs Lane precinct is primarily significant as a unique ensemble of nineteenth century residential buildings, laneways and rear yards in The Rocks, and because it includes the terrace, 103-111 Gloucester Street, which is a very rare extant example in Sydney of an early Victorian Greek Revival style terrace of houses created as total composition. Longs Lane precinct is also significant because it is indicative of the nineteenth and early-twentieth century residential character of The Rocks, retaining strong associational and geographic links with community services such as shops, and churches. It retains rare examples of early-nineteenth century public laneways in their original scale and orientation. It is a unique ensemble in the Rocks of tenanted residential buildings of varying nineteenth and early twentieth century architectural periods including the Early Victorian, Victorian, and Edwardian. It possesses a unique archaeological potential as a discrete cluster of buildings, laneways, and rear yards of various buildings, relatively undisturbed since 1915, dating from the earliest period of occupation in Sydney. Longs Lane is a rare extant public right of way known to have existed from the first decade of the nineteenth century. Carahers Lane is a rare documented site where the existence of slum housing from the-mid to late-nineteenth century can be shown to be associated with the remaining physical fabric, and historical documentation about the landlords/owners.Clive Lucas Stapleton, 1991:94 113-115 Gloucester Street are typical of 1880s terraces in inner Sydney. 113 Gloucester St holds significance as associated with the household of the Law family from -1903, Joseph Law was a Chinese Interpreter and government translator. The site holds significance for its importance to the history of Chinese in Australia and attempts to negotiate between two very different cultures Terrace was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site of 113-115 Gloucester Street is historically significant as a site continuously occupied since the 1820s. 113-115 Gloucester Street is historically significant as a key component in demonstrating the evolution of the Long's Lane precinct, which is a unique ensemble in The Rocks of 19th century residential buildings, laneways, and rear yards. 113-115 Gloucester Street is of historical significance in its own right as a reflection of the 1880s speculative development of The Rocks, during a period of intense redevelopment of the area as a result of the economic boom years of the latter 19th century. The history of 113-115 Gloucester Street's decline into dereliction, and the occupation of the building by squatters prior to the conservation works of the early 1990s reflects the changing social context of The Rocks from the late 19th century to the present. The decision of the State government to restore the building for residential (rather than commercial) purposes demonstrates the prevailing political will and public funding dedicated to the conservation of heritage in the post-Green Bans period in The Rocks. 113-115 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. 113-115 Gloucester Street is historically associated with the William Long and his descendants, as well as the numerous individuals and families who occupied the houses over time, including Joseph Law, a Chinese interpreter who occupied No. 113 between 1885 and 1902. 113-115 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on a local level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 113-115 Gloucester Street is of some aesthetic significance locally as an example a typical Victorian terrace of the 1880s. The aesthetic significance of the building has been revealed and can now be better understood through reconstruction and conservation. 113-115 Gloucester Street makes a substantial contribution to the streetscape significance of The Rocks, particularly complementing the terraced character of the eastern side of Gloucester Street (including the Jobbins Terrace at 103-111 Gloucester Street, the Edwardian Cottages at 46-56 Gloucester Street, Susannah Place at 58-64 Gloucester Street, and Baker's Terrace at 66-72 Gloucester Street). 113-115 Gloucester Street makes a substantial contribution to the aesthetic significance of the Long's Lane Precinct as an ensemble of 19th and early 20th century buildings, associated laneways, and rear yards. 113-115 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As part of The Rocks area, 113-115 Gloucester Street is likely to be held in some esteem by the individuals and groups who are interested in Sydney's history and heritage. No. 113 Gloucester Street has been identified by the Chinese Australian Cultural Heritage Group as a site which is of significance to the history of the Chinese community in NSW. No. 113 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on a local level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The archaeological resource at 113-115 Gloucester Street is of research significance as a rare example of a site yielding archaeological evidence of the pre-1830 period of European settlement in Sydney. The results of previous archaeological investigations of the site and those adjacent to it are fully documented and form, together with other projects carried out in the area, a valuable resource for understanding early life in The Rocks area. 113-115 Gloucester Street is of some technical significance as an example of \\"academic\\" conservation work in which reconstructed fabric was strictly based on extant material and constructed in a traditional manner. 113-115 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on a local level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 113-115 Gloucester Streets does not, itself, possess any rare or uncommon aspects of significance. The Long's Lane Precinct is of significance as an ensemble of 19th and early 20th century buildings, associated laneways, and rear yards which is rare (probably unique) in the Sydney region and NSW. 113-115 Gloucester Street does not meet this criterion on a local or State level. The Long's Lane precinct meets this criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. 113-115 Gloucester Street is a good representative example of 1880s terrace housing within the context of the Long's Lane precinct, itself a significant area in demonstrating the 19th century townscape of The Rocks, complete with intact rear yards and laneways. 113-115 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on a local level.

It was designed by W. Foggitt and built from 1912 to 1915. It is also known as Longs Lane Terraces/Precinct (Long's). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The formalisation of land claims in The Rocks commenced with grants made by Governor Darling in 1829 and continued for close to two decades. Allotment 21 of section 74 was formally granted to John Terry Hughes in January 1839. In 1848, William Todd, on behalf of George Cooper Turner and Oswald Bloxsome, purchased the allotment. In turn Bloxsome and Thomas Iceton subdivided the land in 1853. Upon this subdivision Richard Wilde, a publican, purchased lots 7, 8, 9 and 10 for just over ¬£2400. Maps drawn between 1823 and 1842 show an L-shaped structure on Allotment 21 to the south of the study area, which was demolished by 1850. In its place was constructed a single-storey, two-roomed iron building, owned by Richard Wilde, the publican who owned the Erin Go Bragh hotel to the west (fronting Cumberland Street), and occupied by various tenants between 1861 and 1871. This structure again was to the south of the study area. The study area itself remained vacant apart from an iron shed, single storey with two rooms. A decade later the structure had been replaced by a pair of shops with four rooms. This building was later noted in the Rate Assessment Books as stables. In October 1872 Richard Wilde defaulted on a mortgage held by Faulkner Hope Bartlett, and was forced to sell the property for the sum of ¬£1850. The new owner was noted as Robert Read Hickson. Despite the presence of the stables in 1881, the property throughout this period and into the early twentieth century would more accurately be characterised as vacant land. A map from 1887 records an extensive yard on the property, probably part of stables owned by cab proprietor Patrick Mahoney, from 1885 to 1902, who rented the house from 1882 until 1902. Following an outbreak of the plague in Sydney and The Rocks the NSW government, under The Rocks Resumption Act (1901), resumed the area, which was barricaded to prevent further spread of infection. Some buildings were demolished, and from 1912 the NSW Housing Board began to construct housing in the vacant blocks of land in The Rocks. The Housing Board, founded under the Housing Act 1912, was the first such agency in the state devoted to the construction of public housing. The Board acquired land upon which buildings were constructed to be leased to \\"persons qualified under the Act\\" for business or residential purposes. The Housing Board examined public housing initiatives in the UK and Europe, and incorporated those ideas in constructing tenement dwellings in The Rocks. From 1912, the Housing Board built some 30 units in one development along Gloucester, Cumberland and Little Essex streets. In addition to housing, the Board also sought to ensure a mix of housing, corner shops, pubs and the like in the area. The new terraces, including 117 Gloucester Street, were built by J. H. Thompson of Bondi to the design of Board architect W. Foggitt. The first tenant of the new house at No. 117 (now numbered as 119 Gloucester Street) was Charles Smith, of unknown occupation, who lived in the house from 1915 until at least 1932. Of this large Housing Board development, only the northern units remain: the subject building at 117 Gloucester Street, and the building at 140-142 Cumberland Street. No. 117 demonstrates the typical Housing Board plan form, providing outdoor spaces in balconies, rear yards and roof top terraces. Parts of the Gloucester / Essex / Cumberland Streets Housing Board development were demolished in the 1920s to make way for the approaches to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The remainder of the development was demolished with the construction of the Cahill Expressway in the 1950s to make way for the new freeway. No. 117 continued to be tenanted through the 1970s. The last house was vacated in the 1980s when the house was boarded up. Subsequently, squatters occupied the building. Many fixtures were stolen or demolished during this period, perhaps as a result of boom in house renovations elsewhere in the inner city. Between 1994 and 1995, an extensive programme of conservation works were carried out on the building. The work comprised stabilisation, restoration of the front fa√ßade and roofs, cutting in damp proof courses, and construction of new floors. Joinery, plastering, and other surface finishes were reconstructed on the basis of surviving original fabric. The house is now divided into two separate units which are privately leased to tenants.  Description  117-117A (described as 117-119 Gloucester Street in Conservation Plan by Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners and 119-119A Gloucester Street in SCA's Building Data Sheet) Gloucester Street is a part of the Long's Lane Precinct. Long's Lane is a cluster of nineteenth and early-twentieth houses, rear yards, and laneways between Gloucester and Cumberland Streets. 117 Gloucester Street is the only extant example in Gloucester Street of the NSW Government Housing Board redevelopment of the block bounded by Little Essex (now demolished), Cumberland and Gloucester Streets. All the original planning and much of the original architectural detail of this building is intact. The architectural quality of Gloucester Building, although still significant and sympathetic, has been reduced by the demolition of the Little Essex Street block. A striking feature about the design of this building is extensive structural use of reinforced concrete, and the use of cement in moulding details such as skirtings and cornices. This would appear to be an early example of the use of this technology. Style: Edwardian / Australian Federation; Storeys: Three; Roof Cladding: Iron. = Condition = As at 28 September 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Archaeological excavation (1994) involved the removal of occupation deposits from the kitchens of 113-115, dating from 1881 to s. Deposits in the rest of the properties were untouched with the exception of 300x300 excavations in the centres of each of the four main ground floor rooms in 113-115 for the construction of floor supports. All services were surface mounted beneath floor joists to avoid disturbance of potential archaeological remains. An existing service trench in 117 was re-excavated and utilised for the same purpose. Pre 1912 deposits in 117 untouched. Investigation: Historical research and assessment of archaeology. Partly disturbed. = Modifications and dates = *1992-97: Conservation and restoration of the Long's Lane precinct.  Heritage listing  117-117a Gloucester Street, The Rocks was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. 117 Gloucester Street is historically significant as a key component in demonstrating the evolution of the Long's Lane precinct, which is a unique ensemble in The Rocks of 19th and early 20th century residential buildings, laneways, and rear yards. 117 Gloucester Street is of historical significance in its own right as one of two surviving fragments remaining from a large public housing scheme fronting Gloucester, Cumberland, and Little Essex Streets. (The second fragment is at 140-142 Cumberland Street.) The scheme was carried out by the NSW Housing Board, the first agency in NSW to be established solely for the purpose of building and managing public housing. The Housing Board's work in The Rocks reflects the increasing role played by government in the welfare of citizens in the early 20th century. The history of 117 Gloucester Street's decline into dereliction, and the occupation of the building by squatters prior to the conservation works of the early 1990s reflect the changing social context of The Rocks over the course of the 20th century. The decision of the State government to restore the building for residential (rather than commercial) purposes demonstrates the prevailing political will and public funding dedicated to the conservation of heritage in the post-Green Bans period in The Rocks. 117 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on the State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. 117 Gloucester Street is significant as one of a small number of buildings constructed under the Housing Act of 1912 by the NSW Housing Board, the first agency to be established in NSW to deal directly with the provision of public housing. 117 Gloucester Street does not meet this criterion on either a local or State level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 117 Gloucester Street is of aesthetic significance in showing the Edwardian / Australian Federation architectural style as it was applied to a new building type in the early 20th century. While drawing on public housing models from Europe and the UK, the design of the building emphasises its Australian location in the provision of verandahs and flat roof terraces, the predominant use of structural timber in the verandahs, and the use of Australian motifs such as the waratah incorporated into the plaster vents. The aesthetic value of the building has been revealed and can now be better understood through reconstruction and conservation. 117 Gloucester Street makes a substantial contribution to the streetscape significance of The Rocks, particularly in complementing the terraced character of Gloucester Street (including the Jobbins Building at 103-111 Gloucester Street, the terrace houses at 113-115 Gloucester Street, the Edwardian Cottages at 46-56 Gloucester Street, Susannah Place at 58-64 Gloucester Street, and Baker's Terrace at 66-72 Gloucester Street). 117 Gloucester Street makes a substantial contribution to the aesthetic significance of the Long's Lane Precinct as an ensemble of 19th and early 20th century buildings, associated laneways, and rear yards. 117 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on the State level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As part of The Rocks area, 117 Gloucester Street is likely to be held in some esteem by the individuals and groups who are interested in Sydney's history and heritage, however, this esteem does not meet the threshold to be described as significant for this criterion. 117 Gloucester Street does not meet this criterion on either the local or State level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 117 Gloucester Street is a valuable example of the prevailing architectural style as it was applied to a new building type in the first decades of the 20th century, and has the potential to contribute substantially to the understanding of the evolution of housing, in particular public housing constructed by government agencies, in NSW. The archaeological resource at 117 Gloucester Street is of potential research significance complementing the findings of previous archaeological investigations of adjacent sites in order to form a valuable resource for understanding early life in The Rocks area, and in particular the Long's Lane precinct. 117 Gloucester Street is of some technical significance as an example of \\"academic\\" conservation work in which reconstructed fabric was strictly based on extant material and constructed in a traditional manner. 117 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on the State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 117 Gloucester Street is one remnant of a much larger development which was demolished in the mid-20th century. Together with 140-142 Cumberland Street and 46-56 Gloucester Street, the building forms a very small group of buildings constructed for public housing by the NSW Housing Board during its existence, between 1912 and 1924. The Long's Lane Precinct is of significance as an ensemble of 19th and early 20th century buildings, associated laneways, and rear yards which is rare (probably unique) in the Sydney region and NSW. 117 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on the local level. The Long's Lane precinct meets this criterion on the State level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. 117 Gloucester Street is a good representative example of early 20th century tenement housing within the context of the Long's Lane precinct, itself a significant area in demonstrating the 19th century townscape of The Rocks, complete with intact rear yards and laneways. 117 Gloucester Street meets this criterion on the local level. The Long's Lane precinct meets this criterion on the State level.

Synopsis  The BBC synopsis reads: \\"Against a background of prejudice, distrust and powerful rebellion mounting on the streets, a passionate romance builds between Sephy and Callum which will lead them both into terrible danger\\".  Setting  The series takes place in a present day London in an alternate history where 700 years prior several nations in West Africa combined to form the powerful African Empire, and went on to colonise Europe. After a conflict known as the Great World War, control of Europe is split between different African factions, with mainland Europe under control of the Malian Empire and the Moors, whereas Albion (comprising Great Britain and Ireland) and parts of Scandinavia remain under the thumb of the Aprican Empire. Russia and The Balkans remain in active conflict with the African colonisers, although since the Great World War their national borders have been pushed back. The Ottoman Empire also exists, controlling parts of East Asia. Albion appears to be a self-governing colony with its own Prime Minister and executive leadership, an exclusively Cross police force and a military only just opened up to a small number of Nought high-achievers. However, it is still accountable to the Aprican Empire based on the continent. As of 1950, segregation is rigidly enforced in the colony between those of wealthy African descent (known as Crosses or Daggers) and the poorer native white Europeans (known as Noughts or Blankers).

It is endemic the Northern Territory, and is critically endangered under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, being known only from only from Graveside Gorge in the Kakadu National Park, where it grows on sandstone slopes and ledges at the tops of sheer cliffs. It flowers in February, with near-mature pods observed as being present in March, August and October. Description Acacia equisetifolia is an erect grey-green shrub growing up to 1 m tall. The branchlets are densely villous with the weak hairs being about 1 mm long and white and slightly curved. The narrow needle-like phyllodes are arranged in whorls with from 10 to 17 per whorl, and each from 10‚Äì20 mm long, slender (0.3‚Äì0.4 mm wide), and ascending to erect when young, and when old, patent (at about right angles to the supporting stem). They are terete, almost terete or flattish, and a dull green, and tipped with a small point (from 0.1 to 0.3 mm long). The nerves are not visible. The peduncles are mostly from 15 to 30 mm long, and villous as on the branchlets. The inflorescence is globular and has from 30 to 35 flowers, each of which has a very small calyx and is 5-merous. The sessile pods are short (10‚Äì30 mm long, 8‚Äì10 mm wide), flat but obviously raised over seeds, straight to slightly curved, blackish, viscid, and hairy. The seeds are transverse to oblique in the pods. Taxonomy It was first formally described in 2014 by Bruce Maslin and Ian Cowie in Nuytsia. Etymology The species epithet, equisetifolia, alludes to the similarity of the phyllodes in their shape and arrangement to species of the genus, Equisetum L.. Conservation status Assessment against the IUCN criteria has led to the species being listed under both Commonwealth and Northern Territory legislation as critically endangered. It is threatened because of its very low extent and area of occurrence, extreme fluctuations in numbers, and unfavourable fire regimes for a possibly obligate seeder, placing it at risk of rapid extinction.

It is planned to run from the island's capital, Las Palmas along the eastern coast of the island, serving Gran Canaria Airport and terminating in Maspalomas. First announced in 2004, construction on the line has not yet commenced due to funding difficulties. History Between 1893 and 1944 steam tram ran between Las Palmas and Puerto de La Luz. The line was electrified in 1910, although the line reverted to steam traction in 1944, when trams were hauled by a steam locomotive known as La Pepa. A reproduction of this locomotive is now on display in the in Las Palmas. A plan to build a north-south rail link began with the construction of an experimental tren vertebrado (\\"vertebrate train\\") track in Las Palmas between 1972 and 1974. The transit system, designed by Basque engineer Alejandro Goicoechea, consisted of an unusual low-profile train running on elevated concrete tracks through Las Palmas. The project was unsuccessful and was dismantled within a year. Plans to develop a rapid transit railway line on Gran Canaria linking the capital with San Bartolom√© de Tirajana in the south were put forward in the early 21st century by the Gran Canaria Cabildo. The line would run along the eastern coast and connect Las Palmas with the airport. In 2004 the Spanish Ministry of Development put a contract out to competitive tender for a feasibility study on a 50 km railway line from Las Palmas to Maspalomas. Originally, it was planned to construct the railway in phases, with an initial phase consisting of a line running between San Telmo Park in Las Palmas and El Veril Beach on the edge of Playa del Ingl√©s. In future phases the line could be extended northwards into central Las Palmas, with a terminus at Santa Catalina park, and at the southern end the line would be extended through Maspalomas to terminate at Meloneras. In 2008 the Cabildo announced its intention to construct the full route from Las Palmas to Meloneras in a single phase. In 2009 the plans were approved by the Autonomous Government of the Canary Islands, and a planned operational date was given as 2015. The Cabildo's Autoridad √önica del Transporte de Gran Canaria formed a public company called Ferrocarriles de Gran Canaria to manage the construction project. The total cost of the scheme was estimated at ‚Ç¨1,500 million. The Cabildo applied to Spain's central Government for funding for the project, but the scheme did not progress due to budgetary constraints. Between 2009 and 2018, the Spanish Ministry of Development and the Cabildo had spent ‚Ç¨22.42 million on preparatory work for the new railway line. In January 2018 the Ministry of Development and the Cabildo announced that almost all the contracts had been awarded to enable construction to go ahead, including alterations to the route. Funding of ‚Ç¨25.28 million has been awarded to the project by the Spanish state. However, there are still some funding difficulties that prevent the beginning of the construction on the line and the railway. the cost of the scheme has been estimated as ‚Ç¨1,650 million. The Cabildo de Gran Canaria has applied to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for 85% funding for the project, while the remaining 15% will be raised through funding from local and regional government and from private finance. Route The planned railway line would run between Las Palmas in the north and Meloneras in the south of the island. The line is planned to have 11 stations, including an underground station at Gran Canaria Airport. Much of the line is planned to run in tunnels, with the section in the capital running entirely underground as far as the suburb of Jin√°mar. According to plans published by the Cabildo, stations are planned in Santa Catalina Park, San Telmo Park, the island Hospital, Jin√°mar, Telde, Gran Canaria Airport, Carrizal, Arinaga, Vecindario, Playa del Ingl√©s and Meloneras. An additional station at Juan Grande has been proposed by the mayor of San Bartolome de Tirajana. Journey times between Las Palmas and Meloneras would be 25‚Äì30 minutes. Rolling stock A TGC mockup displayed in 2009 closely remsebled a Siemens Velaro AVE Class 103 CAF Civia in TGC livery The trains that will to operate on the Gran Canaria railway are planned to be a hybrid of a commuter train and a high speed train. Initially, ten units of five carriages will operate on the line with a maximum speed of , each capable of carrying 500 passengers. Eventually, 13 units will operate on the line.

On December 23, 1741, after the accession of Elizabeth Petrovna, it lost its powers and was transformed into the Personal Office of the Empress. In 1756, its functions were transferred to the Conference at the Highest Court. History Having come to power in 1730, Anna Ioannovna, instead of the Supreme Privy Council, restored the Senate. Shortly after the abolition of the Privy Council, Anna Ioannovna, by a decree of November 17, 1731, established the Cabinet of Ministers. In 1735 a decree was issued, which the signature of the three cabinet ministers equated to the Imperial signature. During the reign of Anna Leopoldovna, under the influence of Minich, the Cabinet was divided into 3 departments: *Count Burkhard von M√ºnnich, in the rank of First Minister, was in charge of the army, cadet corps and affairs on the Ladoga Canal; *Count Andrey Osterman ‚Äî external relations and fleet; *Prince Alexey Cherkassky and Count Mikhail Golovkin were provided with \\"everything that relates to the interior of the Senate and the Synod, and state fees for the chamber board and other incomes, commerce, justice and other things to which they belong\\". Separate cabinet ministers, in charge of their departments, single-handedly decided matters in them, communicating only \\"for coordination\\" their opinion to other ministers. Only particularly important matters should be decided by the general council. In its new form, the Cabinet did not exist for long: following the accession of Elizaveta Petrovna to the Throne, it was abolished by a decree: \\"On the restoration of the internal state bodies; on the composition of the register, the decree of the former kingdoms, which the use of the State is repugnant of; the destruction of the former Cabinet, and the installation of the new at the Court of Her Imperial Majesty; the establishment in the Governorate Prosecutor, the scope of which is defined for management by the foreign staff of the Chancellor\\" of December 23, 1741. Composition The Cabinet consisted of three cabinet ministers (of two ‚Äî from April 17, 1736 to February 14, 1738, from April 23, 1740 to August 29, 1740, after December 6, 1741, and of the four from November 1741 to March 14, 1741). It constantly included Andrey Osterman and Alexey Cherkassky, and also, replacing each other, Gavriil Golovkin, Pavel Yaguzhinsky, Artemy Volynsky, Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, Mikhail Golovkin and Burkhard von M√ºnnich (the last ‚Äî the fourth cabinet minister).

It measures , and depicts two figures: one swimming underwater and one clothed male figure looking down at the swimmer. In November 2018, it sold for US$90.3 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a painting by a living artist.  Background  Hockney visited California for the first time in January 1964 after a successful first solo exhibition at the John Kasmin gallery. The United States fascinated him, and Los Angeles in particular, partly because of the influence of Hollywood cinema but also because of the modernist building Case Study House #21. As a gay man, he was also a fan of the beefcake magazine Physique Pictorial, which was published in Los Angeles. \\"I instinctively knew I was going to like it,\\" Hockney said, \\"and as I flew over San Bernardino and saw the swimming pools and the houses and everything and the sun, I was more thrilled than I have ever been in arriving in any city.\\" Hockney painted the first of his pool paintings, California Art Collector in 1964, and the swimming pool became a recurring theme in his paintings, such as Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool (1966, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) and most notably A Bigger Splash (1967, Tate Gallery). He painted a series of double portraits from 1968 to 1977, including American Collectors (Fred and Marcia Weisman) (1968, Art Institute of Chicago), and Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy (1971, Tate Gallery).  Composition  This work brings together two of Hockney's themes from his paintings of the late 1960s and early 1970s: the swimming pool, and the double portrait. It depicts a male figure in white trunks swimming breaststroke underwater, and the painter Peter Schlesinger, Hockney's former lover and muse, fully clothed and standing at the edge of the pool looking down at the swimmer. The painting is set in southern France, near Saint-Tropez. In characteristic Hockney style, the foreground is simplified and flattened with a view of tree-clad hills in the background. The composition was inspired by a serendipitous combination of photographs that Hockney noticed on his studio floor: one of a man swimming underwater, taken in California in 1966, and the other of a man standing looking at the ground. Juxtaposed, it appeared as if the standing person was looking at the swimmer. Hockney's relationship with Schlesinger had ended abruptly in 1971, following a fight in Cadaqu√©s. \\"By showing another young man swimming towards Peter, the artist acknowledges lost love and his boyfriend‚Äôs desire for a new partner\\".M. Livingstone and K. Haymer, Hockney's People, London, 2003, p. 112 The painting can be viewed as fitting into a European tradition since the Renaissance of depicting the nude bathing, washing off the stain of pollution amid the peace of nature. Hockney worked on the painting for four months in late 1971, but dissatisfied with the composition, in particular with the angle of the pool, abandoned the work and started afresh. He then travelled for several months with Mark Lancaster, and returned to the work in early 1972. The year 1972 was a very productive year for Hockney, as he threw himself into his work to escape from his unhappiness, often working 14 or 15 hours a day. Around the same time, he was working on his (unfinished) double portrait of George Lawson and Wayne Sleep (1972-5, Tate). In April 1972, Hockney flew to the south of France to better visualise the figure swimming underwater, using the pool at film director Tony Richardson's villa at Le Nid du Duc near Saint-Tropez to do so. Hockney's studio assistant, Mo McDermott, recreated the pose of the downcast man, while a young photographer, John St Clair, was the swimmer. Hockney took hundreds of photographs based on his original composition. Back at his London studio, Hockney assembled the photos along with photographs of Peter Schlesinger taken in Kensington Gardens wearing the same pink jacket. Hockney worked on the painting for two weeks, working 18-hour days, completing and varnishing it only the night before it was due to be shipped to New York for the exhibition at Andr√© Emmerich Gallery. It was first shown in the exhibition Paintings and Drawings, which ran from 13 to 31 May 1972. Hockney said of the painting, \\"I must admit I loved working on that picture, [...] working with such intensity; it was marvellous doing it, really thrilling\\" The creation of the painting and the breakdown of Hockney's relationship with Schlesinger were featured in the semi-fictional 1974 documentary A Bigger Splash, named after the 1967 Hockney painting.  Sale history  The painting was originally sold to James Astor and his wife in 1972 for $18,000 ($108,000 2018 equivalent). Six months later it was sold on for $50,000 ($300,000 2018 equivalent). It was acquired in 1983 by the American billionaire David Geffen, who sold it to British billionaire Joe Lewis in 1995 at an undisclosed price. It was included in the Hockney exhibition, which toured the Tate Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Centre Georges Pompidou from February 2017 to February 2018. On 15 November 2018, in nine minutes of bidding, it was sold to an unknown buyer for $90.3 million at Christie's auction house in New York City, setting an auction record for a living artist.\\"How record-setting art auctions are ruining the old neighborhood\\" commentary on The Washington Post The sale broke the previous record for a living artist of $58 million for Jeff Koons' Balloon Dog (Orange) in 2013 and more than tripled the record for a work by Hockney, $28.5 million for Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica set in May 2018.

Canada At Risk As 'First Cracks' Appear In Global Housing Bubbles: UBS., HuffPost (Canada edition) History Starting in the late 2010s, foreign investment and speculative activity in many of the major cities in Canada caused a boom in the real estate market that lead to a drastic increase in the price of owning and renting a home. A steady drop in interest rates coupled with a steady rise in home prices since the 1990s signaled to consumers that the real estate market had become the perfect option for stable, long-term investments. The feeling that there was a limited supply of homes on the market brought new consumers hastily into the market. Owning a home is also a very sought-after ideal for young adults in Canada. These social pressures along with increasing opportunities for profit were driving the growth of the market, causing first time home buyers to struggle to find a place to live at a reasonable price.Castaldo, Joe. \\"How Canada's Real Estate Market Went Completely Insane.\\" Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News, 10 July 2017, www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/how-canadas-real-estate- market-went-completely-insane/.

There is a high risk that if sentiments begin to change and investors feel that the market is about to take a turn for the worse, that there will be a mass of people selling their properties, causing prices to drop, and potentially snowball.Castaldo, Joe. \\"How Canada's Real Estate Market Went Completely Insane.\\" Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News, 10 July 2017, www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/how-canadas-real-estate-market- went-completely-insane/. If the reset rate for the year is higher than in the past, there will be a large risk of default for Canadians with high amounts of debt. Since two-thirds of Canadian mortgages are backed by insurance, a rise in defaults will leave the debts on the hands of the Canadian government. Any drops in home prices could also cause homeowners to owe more on their mortgages than the house is currently valued, which is known as negative equity.Andrews, Jeff. \\"Canada's Housing Bubble Is Starting to Burst.\\" Curbed, Curbed, 7 Mar. 2018, www.curbed.com/2018/3/7/17085794/canada-housing-market- collapse.Castaldo, Joe. \\"How Canada's Real Estate Market Went Completely Insane.\\" Canadian Business - Your Source For Business News, 10 July 2017, www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/how-canadas-real-estate-market-went- completely-insane/.

Her published plays include F*cking Art, which won top honors at the Samuel French Off-Off-Broadway Short Play Festival, I Used to Write on Walls, Oohrah!, Be a Good Little Widow, Going to a Place Where You Already Are, and The Cake, a play inspired by events leading to the US Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. She is a founding member of The Kilroys, which annually produces The Kilroys' List. Her television work includes writing for I Just Want My Pants Back, Underemployed, Switched at Birth, and American Gods, and both writing and producing on This Is Us.  Early life and education  Rebecca Leah Brunstetter was born on June 13, 1982, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She is the daughter of former North Carolina Senator Peter S. Brunstetter and Jodie Brunstetter. She was raised as the only daughter among three brothers in a conservative Christian home. Brunstetter wrote poems and short stories from a young age, and became involved with theater after moving from a private Christian middle school to Mount Tabor High School, a public school. As a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Brunstetter initially pursued creative writing through poetry, but feedback from her creative writing professors convinced her to try playwriting. She wrote her first play as a first-year student and decided to pursue playwriting as a career. By the time Brunstetter graduated from UNC in 2004 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, the UNC Theater Department had fully staged several of her plays. She continued to study playwriting for three years in the School of Drama at The New School, graduating with a Master of Fine Arts degree.  Career = Early plays = After graduating with her MFA, Brunstetter worked at a corporate job while continuing to write plays. I Used to Write on Walls, her play about three women who fall for a religious man who surfs and draws graffiti, premiered at the Gene Frankel Theatre Underground in New York in 2007, with Gwen Orel of Backstage calling it a \\"would-be feminist fable\\" that is \\"less convincing than cute\\". Duncan Pflaster of BroadwayWorld observed that the play seemed to \\"reinforce the stereotype that women need men to feel complete\\", but praised Brunstetter's writing and character development. Robert Hurwitt's review in the San Francisco Chronicle of the play's 2010 West Coast premiere also praised the quality of the dialogue, but called the lengthy play \\"a bit too much of one initially good thing\\". In 2008, her play F*cking Art, about a cheerleader who visits her cancer-stricken classmate, was a winner at the 33rd Annual Samuel French Off-Off-Broadway Short Play Festival, and was subsequently published by Samuel French. The following year she was named Playwright in Residence at Ars Nova, and her play Oohrah!, a story about the family lives of people in a North Carolina town changing as veterans return home from Iraq, premiered off-Broadway at Stage 2 of the Atlantic Theater Company. In his review of Oohrah!, Charles Isherwood of The New York Times praised Brunstetter as an up-and-coming new playwright, but found the play \\"generally unconvincing\\". Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News assessed Oohrah! as \\"about as deep as your average sitcom\\", while drawing attention to the quality of Brunstetter's dialogue and writing of female characters. Brunstetter's play Miss Lilly Gets Boned, a story about a religious woman whose disappointment in love causes her to plot revenge against a South African man who lost his wife in an elephant attack, premiered in 2010 at the Finborough Theatre. Writing for The Guardian, Michael Billington found the development of the main character to be unconvincing, but noted the high quality of the production and acting. In 2019, Rogue Machine Theatre produced the play's West Coast premiere in Los Angeles. Jeffrey Scott's BroadwayWorld review of the Los Angeles production praised the play, actors, and production quality, particularly the performance of Larisa Oleynik in the lead role, but also suggested that the story could be split into three one-act plays in future productions. During her Ars Nova residency Brunstetter wrote a new play, titled Be a Good Little Widow, about the relationship between a woman and her husband's mother before and after the husband's death. Be a Good Little Widow premiered at Ars Nova in 2011, with a cast including Jill Eikenberry and Wrenn Schmidt. Writing for The New York Times, Adam Hetrick reviewed the play positively, praising Brunstetter for writing straightforward dialogue and genuinely emotional characters. A review by Chris Jones in the Chicago Tribune was less favorable to a 2011 Collaboraction staging of the play, calling Be a Good Little Widow \\"sincerely meant but structurally immature\\". Kathleen Foley later reviewed the Los Angeles premiere positively in the Los Angeles Times, observing that Brunstetter was adept at manipulating the audience's emotions to good effect. = Expanding into screenwriting = While working as a playwright, Brunstetter started a business writing audition monologues for actors and looked for other writing work to supplement her playwriting income. Her theater agent introduced her to a television agent in Los Angeles, and she was hired as a writer's assistant by MTV. After spending a season as an assistant on the short-lived MTV show I Just Want My Pants Back, she became a member of the writing staff for another MTV show, Underemployed, before moving to the ABC Family drama Switched at Birth, where she worked as a staff writer for three seasons. Brunstetter continued her playwriting while working as a screenwriter, premiering her work Forgotten Corners of Your Dark, Dark Place, which starred actresses in wheelchairs, at the Theater Breaking Through Barriers' annual festival of new plays. Anita Gates of The New York Times praised the actresses' performances, but expressed concern that the play was unclear about whether or not it was mocking feminist self-examination groups. Brunstetter also collaborated with other Los Angeles-area writers to create The Kilroys' List, an annual list of plays by female and transgender playwrights modeled on the Black List but intended to promote gender equity. The list featured her own play The Oregon Trail, about a girl who withdraws from social life as she plays the video game The Oregon Trail. The play subsequently premiered at the Women's Voices Theater Festival, with Nelson Pressley of The Washington Post concluding that \\"even some over-explaining in the final steps doesn‚Äôt erase the pleasure of this quest\\". = The Cake and American Gods = In 2015, Brunstetter began writing The Cake, a play about a baker who is asked to bake a cake for the wedding of her best friend's daughter but refuses because it is a same-sex wedding. The play was inspired by real-life events that eventually led to the Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission Supreme Court case, and by her father's opposition to same-sex marriage, a view with which she disagrees. The play premiered in Los Angeles, with Debra Jo Rupp in the starring role. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Philip Brandes praised the play's narrative structure but noted that some of the dialogue \\"reads like a laundry list of liberal activist accusations\\". The play has been widely produced, including shows at the La Jolla Playhouse, Houston's Alley Theatre, and an Off-Broadway premiere at the Manhattan Theatre Club at New York City Center that Jesse Green of The New York Times described as \\"well-baked but not quite filling\\". At the same time that she was writing The Cake, Brunstetter started work on the new Starz series American Gods, based on Neil Gaiman's novel of the same name. As part of the writing team for American Gods, Brunstetter helped develop the character of the goddess Easter. She was credited as a writer on the first-season finale, titled \\"Come to Jesus\\", which Oliver Sava singled out in Vulture as an exciting standout in an otherwise poorly-paced season. = This Is Us (2016‚Äìpresent) = Brunstetter also joined the NBC series This Is Us, first as a staff writer, then story editor, before becoming a supervising producer; her job entails auditioning actors and rewriting scripts. She was nominated along with fellow producers for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 2017 and 2018. Her personal childhood bullying experience inspired a \\"heartbreaking\\" scene in This Is Us in which an overweight young girl is excluded from playing with the other girls. The show debuted in 2016, and received the highest ratings among new shows on American broadcast television in its first season. = Going to a Place Where You Already Are and later work = In 2016, South Coast Repertory premiered Going to a Place Where You Already Are, a play the company commissioned from Brunstetter. The play follows a terminally ill woman who comes to believe in heaven, leading her to abandon further medical treatment against the wishes of her spouse, who does not believe in an afterlife. It is based in part on conversations Brunstetter had with her father's atheist parents about death and heaven. In the Los Angeles Times, Daryl Miller called Going to a Place Where You Already Are a \\"terrific new play\\", highlighting her simultaneously emotional and entertaining treatment of serious subjects. The play was also produced by the Boulder Ensemble Theater Company, where it was panned by Juliet Wittman in Westword as a saccharine remix of elements from This Is Us, and at Theater Alliance of Washington, DC, where John Stoltenberg of DC Metro Theater Arts called it \\"an extraordinary exploration of love in life and loss in death\\". Brunstetter was one of several writers to receive an inaugural $5,000 Writers Alliance Grant from the Dramatists Guild Foundation in 2018, with Brunstetter's grant supporting a new commission from Theater Breaking Through Barriers. The resulting play, about a woman who borrows money from her politically conservative father under false pretenses to pay for an abortion, premiered the following year at Clurman Theatre in the Theatre Row Building under the title Public Servant. In The New York Times, Laura Collins- Hughes criticized Public Servant for its character and plot development, observing that the play's story seemed \\"grafted to fit\\" its politics. While lauding the inclusive casting of Public Servant, Deb Miller of DC Metro Theater Arts expressed disapproval of Brunstetter's \\"signature TV style\\", noting particularly her handling of the play's various dilemmas with \\"forced, overly sentimental, and unbelievably contrived\\" resolutions. Brunstetter was hired in 2017 to adapt the bestselling self-help book The Secret for film. Her script adapts the book's ideas about the \\"law of attraction\\" into a story about the relationship between a widowed mother and a handyman who shares his thoughts on how the universe works. In 2019, singer Ingrid Michaelson announced that she and Brunstetter had been collaborating on an adaptation of The Notebook into a Broadway musical, with author Nicholas Sparks later confirming his involvement in the production.  Personal life  Brunstetter married actor Morrison Keddie in 2016. In 2017, as a Valentine's Day present, Brunstetter wrote a short film script for Keddie based on a story about his uncle. The resulting film, titled Again, with Keddie portraying the lead role of a man who repeatedly watches the film Groundhog Day, was selected for the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival. Keddie has since provided the voice of George in the Barrington Stage Company production of The Cake. , Brunstetter resides in Los Angeles, California.

He is best known for sacking Campeche and for joining a large buccaneer force which captured Veracruz. History In early 1678 Spurre joined with Edward Neville off the coast of Cuba, using a French privateering commission to capture two Spanish vessels. They collected additional crew before sailing to Campeche in July 1678. Neville and Spurre attacked the city at night, slipping past the garrison using captured guides, and captured it with little resistance. After several days of looting they left with ransoms, captured ships, and hundreds of slaves. Spurre returned to Jamaica in October, where he spent a few years as a trader. Spanish forces (including privateer and pirate Juan Corso) retaliated by seizing the camps and ships of logwood cutters on the Campeche coast. By 1682 he was again known to the Spanish as a pirate, and in early 1683 joined a large buccaneer fleet preparing to raid Veracruz. Among the fleet's leaders were Nicholas van Hoorn, Michel de Grammont, Jan Willems, Laurens de Graaf, and Michiel Andrieszoon. Spurre was one of only two English captains in the assembly, the other being Jacob Hall. That May they attacked by surprise and captured the city easily, looting it for several days. Spurre located the cowering Governor and saved him from angry Frenchmen, netting the buccaneers a huge ransom: ‚Äú[they] had seventy thousand pieces of Eight for the Governour Don Luis de Cordoua's Ransome, which Spurre found hid amongst Grass in a Stable.‚Äù The buccaneers scattered afterwards; Hall sailed to Carolina but Spurre left for French Saint-Domingue, where he died soon after.

He was an outstanding, and passionate teacher. He had a profound impact on many of his students. He was a senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France, 1992‚Äì2002.  Publications  Author of nearly 250 scientific articles in international peer-reviewed journals and numerous journal articles and book chapters. Main journals: Biochemical J (35), Journal of Biological Chemistry (27), European Journal of Biochemistry (20), Proceeding National Academy of Sciences USA (12), Plant Physiology (50), Biochemistry (8), Biochemica Biophysica Acta (13), FEBS letters (14), Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysic (13).  Areas of expertise  Cell and whole plant physiology, specialising in chloroplasts and mitochondria, cell metabolism, especially energy metabolism, amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis. Biochemistry, molecular biology and structural biology. Botany and ornithology.  Main discoveries  The first contribution of Roland Douce was the characterization of cardiolipin, the major lipid of the mitochondrial membrane of plants and animals, as phosphatidyl ethanolamineTh√®se de doctorat d‚Äô√©tat, Paris, 1970, Structure, localisation et m√©tabolisme du diphosphatidylglyc√©rol, ou cardiolipine, dans les plantes. He then considerably improved the methods of purification of chloroplasts and mitochondria, and obtained the first envelope preparations. He was the first to show that the chloroplast shell is the site of biosynthesis of galactolipids and in particular MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. With his team, he will characterize the lipid and protein components of the envelope of the plastids. He will succeed in separating the inner and outer shells. This work will pave the way for a detailed analysis of the chloroplast, its envelopes and functions . Several of the envelope protein genes will be cloned, including the MGDG synthase gene. Similar work will be carried out on the mitochondria with the development of a purification method. It will thus be possible to carry out functional analysis, in particular of the proteins involved in photorespiration and the subunits of the glycine-decarboxylase complex . Chloroplasts and mitochondria are involved in the biosynthesis of several amino acids and vitamins. Roland Douce, in collaboration with industry, will elucidate the biosynthesis pathways of several amino acids, and thus define several potential targets for herbicide molecules . Similarly, he will elucidate the biosynthesis pathways of biotin and tetrahydrofolic acid (vitamin B12). The last part of Roland Douce's work deals with the plant's metabolism, under normal physiological conditions, or under conditions of stress (nutrient deficiency, light or heat stress) . In this work, he has largely contributed to promoting the use of nuclear magnetic resonance in plant physiology. Roland Douce was passionate about the mountains and he made a major contribution to renovating and developing the botanical garden of the Col du Lautaret, and to setting up a research laboratory there, associated with the University of Grenoble. He was the author or coordinator of several books or reports on plant mitochondria, the plant world, transgenic plants, and hypotheses on the origin of life. He also coordinated two volumes of the Advances in Botanical Research series on vitamin biosynthesis .

Nguyen, a second-generation Vietnamese American, was raised with his three siblings in White Center, Washington, by his mother. He is a program manager at Microsoft. Early life and career Nguyen was born in White Center, Washington, as one of four children to a pair of Vietnamese immigrants who arrived in the United States as refugees. His family lived in public housing and relied on social services, particularly after his father became a quadriplegic in an accident. His mother worked as a seamstress, while Nguyen himself worked at his own high school as a janitor. He graduated from John F. Kennedy Catholic High School in Burien after serving as class president for three years. Nguyen attended Seattle University and served as student body president for two years before graduating with Bachelor of Arts degrees in finance and humanities with a minor in economics. Nguyen worked as a senior strategist for Expedia and is a senior program manager at Microsoft with an emphasis on strategy and analytics. He has been involved in the company's charitable education program. Nguyen chaired the Associate Board of Wellspring Family Services, a nonprofit organization for homeless services. During his time on the board, the state legislature passed trauma counseling legislation on behalf of Wellspring's lobbying. He also served on the King County Community Advisory Committee on Law Enforcement Oversight, which included criticism of the King County Sheriff's handling of the shooting of Tommy Le in June 2017. Le, a young Vietnamese American man, was shot by officers in Burien who were cleared of wrongdoing by an internal investigation of the Sheriff's Office, inciting outrage in the Vietnamese community.

The 34th district includes White Center, West Seattle, Vashon Island, and part of Burien. He aimed to increase the representation of people of color in government and \\"for people here to realize they have the power, the authority, to actually make positive change\\", also launching a podcast series to attract other potential candidates. Nguyen finished at the top of the primary with 31 percent of the vote, ahead of ten other candidates, and advanced to the general election alongside Shannon Braddock, a staffer to King County Executive Dow Constantine. Nguyen, running as a Democrat, campaigned on a platform that focused on housing affordability, healthcare for all, public transit improvements, environmental protections, and education reform. He received the endorsements of congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, several Seattle and Burien council members, various local unions, and The Stranger. His campaign declined to use PAC funding, raising half as much as Braddock's campaign. Nguyen won the general election on November 6, 2018, defeating Braddock with 58 percent of the vote. He became one of the first two Vietnamese American legislators to be elected to the Washington State Legislature, alongside My-Linh Thai from the 41st district. =Legislative accomplishments= In March 2020, Nguyen sponsored and passed a bill curtailing the use of facial recognition by the government and required government agencies to report facial recognition usage. https://www.geekwire.com/2020/washington-state-passes-landmark-facial- recognition-bill-reining-government-use-ai/ In April 2020, Nguyen sponsored and passed a bill expanding access to Washington State's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, allowing families without regular housing to receive funds for more than the allotted 60 days. https://www.nbcrightnow.com/news/governor-signs-law-to-expand-tanf- benefits/article_b8837226-7538-11ea-8d0e-d755da968633.html Personal life Nguyen is married to Tallie Nguyen, a special education teacher at the Highline Public Schools.

Pettigrew (April 8, 1839 ‚Äì July 14, 1912) was an American educator and missionary. She was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Anti-Saloon League. She served as head of the missionary and training department of the Woman's American Baptist Home Mission Society, and as South Dakota State superintendent of the press department for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (W.C.T.U.). Hailing from Vermont, she traveled extensively around the world and lived in many cities in the United States before settling, like her brother Richard, a United States Senator, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where she died. Early years and education Belle Luella (or Luella Belle) Pettigrew was born in Ludlow, Vermont, April 8, 1839. She was the daughter of Andrew Pettigrew (1810‚Äì1866) and Hannah Brazer (Sawtell) Pettigrew (1816‚Äì1878). One of her brothers, Richard, became a United States Senator from South Dakota. Her other siblings were Hannah, Justin, Alma, Henrietta, Frederick, and Elizabeth. Andrew Pettigrew was a man of strong convictions, religious, and trained his family according to the moral code common to the New England Christian faith. He was an abolitionist and a distributor of emancipation literature, and a link in the Underground Railroad to assist runaway slaves from the south on their way to Canada. For his outspoken views in opposition to slavery, and his approval of William Lloyd Garrison of Boston, many people boycotted his business and refused to trade in his store, and often threatened him with violence. Her mother, Hannah B. Sawtell, was of Puritan ancestry; her ancestors came to Watertown, Massachusetts, in 1630. They were at the siege of Lewisburg, and Elnathan, her grandfather, was a private soldier at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Andrew Pettigrew was in poor health and, in 1854, he sold his store and with his family moved to the town of Union, Rock County, Wisconsin , where he purchased a farm and engaged in general farming. In 1860, he moved to Evansville, Wisconsin so that his numerous children could attend the Evansville Academy. In 1863, when the first slaves came north as a result of the Civil War, he gave these African Americans the preference and employed them upon the farm. An ex-slave started a blacksmith shop, and Andrew Pettigrew gave this blacksmith all his work. It was well to give these ex-slaves employment, but the effort to establish their social equality was not understood by them. Pettigrew graduated from the Rockford Seminary (now Rockford University) in 1859, and afterwards, took special studies, at three different times, in University of Chicago. Career After leaving college, she devoted her life to teaching and missionary work. For twelve years, she represented the Woman's Baptist Home Mission Society as missionary among African Americans, teaching at two historically black institutions, Shaw University and Roger Williams University, where she also served as preceptress. She also spent three years as general missionary in South Dakota. In the fall of 1893, she entered the University of Chicago for six months, then spent seven months traveling in Europe. In 1894, she was the head of the missionary and training department of the Woman's American Baptist Home Mission Society. She later lived for several years in Washington D.C., where was a member of the Columbia Chapter Daughters of the American Revolution, the W.C.T.U. and the Anti-Saloon League, as well as being a member of a missionary society and literary club connected with the Calvary Baptist Church. In April 1904, she returned from a two years' trip around the world, spending several months in Europe, four in India and Burma, several days in the Philippines, three months in China, a short visit in Seoul, Korea, six months in Japan, three weeks in Hawaii and ten weeks in California, visiting the principal cities from San Francisco to San Diego. She went on the trip as a tourist, but being especially interested in missions, visited more than 100 mission homes of all denominations. She made some trips with missionaries in Burma, China and Japan, visiting three places in Japan where no foreign woman had been. Later years After living in Evansville, Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin, La Crosse, Wisconsin, Chicago, Illinois, Raleigh, North Carolina, Atlanta, Georgia, Memphis, Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee, and Washington, D.C., she became a resident of Sioux Falls, South Dakota in 1904, living in her own home, and was active as local officer and as State superintendent of the press department for the W.C.T.U. In 1908, she served as chair of the Industrial and Child Labor committee of the South Dakota Federation of Woman's Clubs. She remained single, and died July 14, 1912. She is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Sioux Falls.

Light pink = closed military areas or settlement boundary areas or areas isolated by the Israeli West Bank barrier; dark pink = settlements, outposts or military bases. The black line = route of the Barrier The Israeli occupation of the West Bank began on 7 June 1967 during the Six- Day War when Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and continues to the present day. The status of the West Bank as an occupied territory has been affirmed by the International Court of Justice and, with the exception of East Jerusalem, by the Israeli Supreme Court. The official Israeli government view is that the law of occupation does not apply and it claims the territories are \\"disputed\\". Considered to be a classic example of an \\"intractable\\" conflict, the length of Israel's occupation was already regarded as exceptional after two decades and is now the longest in modern history. Israel has cited several reasons for retaining the West Bank within its ambit: a claim based on the notion of historic rights to this as a homeland as affirmed in the Balfour Declaration; security grounds, internal and external; and the deep symbolic value for Jews of the area occupied. Perhaps the most closely researched modern conflict, controversies abound even as to what terminology is the most appropriate, with pro-Israeli sources favouring one set of terms and the Palestinian Authority advocating a different nomenclature. Disputes arise over the bias of keywords, and whether the Israeli or Palestinian viewpoint dominates media representations. Public discussion of the occupation is also contested, especially on university campuses. Pro-Israeli Jewish students complain they vilified or harassed; some proposed talks on Palestinian perspectives have been cancelled on the grounds that audiences might not be able to objectively evaluate the material. In response to attempts to silence several high-profile critics of Israeli territorial policies concerns have been expressed that the topic itself is at risk, and that the political pressures restricting research and discussion undermine academic freedom. Israel has controversially, and in contravention of international law, established numerous settlements throughout the West Bank. The United Nations Security Council has consistently reaffirmed that settlements in that territory are a \\"flagrant violation of international law\\", most recently with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334. The creation and ongoing expansion of the settlements have led to Israel's policies being criticized as an example of colonialism. Israel has been accused of exercising methods of control in its administration of the occupation that constitute major violations of International human rights law. Israeli settlers and civilians travelling through the West Bank are subject to Israeli civilian law while Palestinian civilians are subject to military law and are not permitted to vote in Israeli national elections, leading to comparisons to apartheid. The occupation has numerous critics in Israel itself, with some Israel Defense Forces draftees refusing to serve due to their objections to the occupation. The language of conflict and coverage in academia and the media Terminology bias, it has been argued, is written into reportage about the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, with concerns over language manipulation often expressed, with Peter Beinart even suggesting there was a pattern of Orwellian \\"linguistic fraud and a culture of euphemism\\" at work- Each party has its preferred set of descriptive words. The word \\"occupation\\", once current, has slipped from view in US mainstream reportage, and is almost taboo. A survey of British newspapers readers in 2001 found that only 9% knew that Israel occupied the Palestinian territories. International usage speaks of the West Bank, whereas Israeli usage prefers Judea and Samaria; the IDF \\"says\\" or \\"confirms\\" while Palestinians \\"claim\\"; Israelis are \\"kidnapped\\" whereas Palestinians are \\"arrested\\"; for Israel, violence refers to occasional events, for Palestinians it is an everyday feature of the occupation; what Palestinians regard as assassinations are \\"pinpoint preventive operations\\" for Israel; what some call \\"colonies\\" are called \\"settlements\\" or \\"neighbourhoods\\" by others; what some call \\"displacement\\" is for Palestinians \\"dispossession\\"; Israel military actions are self-defensive \\"retaliations\\" for Palestinian attacks, while the context before the latter is often omitted, lending credence to the idea Israel never initiates violence. The way the conflict is reported are extensively monitoring and analysed: in addition to Israel's public diplomacy, intent on countering negative press images, there are also many private pro-Israeli organizations, among them CAMERA, FLAME, HonestReporting, Palestinian Media Watch, Canary Mission and the Anti- Defamation League which claim much reportage is distorted. The term Pallywood was coined to suggest that Palestinian coverage of their plight is manipulative fake news. John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have argued that United States media coverage, compared to other countries, tilts strongly in Israel's favour. This view that American media are biased against Palestinians has been challenged by authors who cite research that concluded most mainstream media have a \\"liberal\\" bias, a criticism extended to European outlets like Le Monde and the BBC. The quality of both Media coverage of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict and research and debates on university campuses have been the object of extensive monitoring and research. In the latter regard, organizations like Campus Watch closely report and denounce what they consider \\"anti-Israeli\\" attitudes. Academics like Sara Roy have argued on the other hand that\\"the climate of intimidation and censorship surrounding the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, both inside (at all levels of the education hierarchy) and outside the U.S. academy, is real and longstanding\\". Attempts have been made to silence several high-profile critics of Israeli policies in the territories, among them Tony Judt, Norman Finkelstein, Joseph Massad, Nadia Abu El-Haj and William I. Robinson. Such difficulties have given rise to anxieties that the topic itself is at risk, and that the political pressures circumscribing research and discussion undermine academic freedom itself. Internal Israeli studies have argued that local press coverage has traditionally been conservative, reflecting the often tendentious and biased views of the political and military establishment, and similar tendencies have been noted in Palestinian reportage. Tamar Liebes, former director of the Smart Institute of Communication at the Hebrew University, argued that Israeli \\"Journalists and publishers see themselves as actors within the Zionist movement, not as critical outsiders\\". The explosive expansion of the Internet has opened up a larger sphere of controversy, with digital forensics on social networks occasionally revealing problems with a few widely circulating images of dead Palestinians, but, also led to the emergence of militant social media practitioners who maintain fraudulence was natural for Palestinians and that images of their dead and wounded were generally faked. The West Bank in 1967 Israel's economy was 10 times larger than the West Bank's on the eve of the occupation, but had experienced two years of recession. The West Bank's population stood between 585,500-803,600 and, during the Jordanian occupation accounted for 40% of Jordan's GNP, with an annual growth rate of 6-8%. Ownership of land was generally collective, and the 19th century Ottoman land code prevailed, which classified land as either ‚Äì waqf, m√ºlk, miri, matruke, and mawat ‚Äì the last three being formally state land, though Jordan never considered these last three as state property, and only a very small proportion of the West Bank was registered as such under Jordanian rule. Education was (and remains ) a high priority, with 44.6% of West Bank teenagers in the 15‚Äì17 year bracket frequenting school compared to Israel's 22.8%. The enrollments rate averaged an annual increase of 7% over the prior decade, and by 1966, Palestinian youth had the highest enrollment rate of all Arab countries. Compared to Israel, the West Bank had a favorable educational basis, due to the preexisting provisions of the Jordanian school system which provided 12 years of free and compulsory education. 84.4% of Israelis in the 6-11 age group, compared to 80.5% of West Bank children, went to school, but the disparity was inverted for the 15‚Äì17 year olds, with 44.6% of West Bank teenagers frequenting school, as compared to 22.8% of Israelis at that age. Conquest Palestine remains the only Arab land which has been denied Arab rule and independent statehood. In 1956, the Israeli leader David Ben-Gurion stated that: \\"Jordan has no right to exist.. The territory to the West of the Jordan should be made an autonomous region of Israel\\". That Zionism thought of partition agreements as temporary and aspired from the outset to incorporate all of Palestine into a Jewish state went back at least to declarations of intent made by Ben-Gurion in 1937-1938 Before the Six-Day War, there had been an unwritten agreement between Israel and the Jordanian government to uphold the neutrality of the border between the two countries along the Green Line. According to King Hussein, after Israel retaliated against Syrian-backed guerrilla infiltrations and sabotage by conducting on 13 November 1966 an assault on Samu in the West Bank, an area administered by Jordan, that tacit accord was broken. After Israel attacked Egypt at 8 a.m. on 5 June 1967, Jordan responded by shelling Israeli targets in West Jerusalem, and settlements along the border and then, after ignoring an Israeli warning, by attacking Israeli airfields in Ramat David and Kfar Syrkin, but also Netanya. In response, the Israeli army in a swift campaign took possession of East Jerusalem and, after news that King Hussein had ordered his forces to withdraw across the Jordan, took the entire West Bank by noon on 8 June. Israel expelled many people from areas it had conquered, beginning with an estimated 12,000 people who on the very first day were rounded up in the villages of Imwas, Yalo and Bayt Nuba in the Latrun Salient and ordered by the Israeli military into exile eastwards. All three villages were then blown up, and within two years the area was planned as a recreational area now called Canada Park. Tens of thousands of Palestinians fled to Jordan from the refugee camps of Aqabat Jaber and Ein as-Sultan after Israel bombed the camps. The overall numbers of Palestinians displaced by that war is generally estimated to have been around 280,000-325,000, of which it has been calculated that some 120‚Äì170,000 were two-time refugees, having been displaced earlier during the 1948 war. The number who left the West Bank as a consequence of the war ranges from 100,000 to 400,000, of which from 50,000 to 200,000 lived in the Jordan Valley. =Military-Civil Administration= During the 1967 June War Israel appointed a Military Governor to rule the West Bank, with a remit to retain Jordanian law except where these conflicted with Israel's rights as belligerent occupying power. From 1967 to 2014, the Israeli administration issued over 1,680 military orders regarding the West Bank. The third military order, issued two days after the onset of the occupation, specified that military courts were to apply the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention regarding the protection of civilians in a war zone: within 4 months this stipulation was erased from the order. Jordan maintains that some of the laws ostensibly retained from its code, stemming from the Mandatory Defence (Emergency) Regulations of 1945, had in fact been abolished, and were invalid as they conflicted with the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. The Israeli Military Governorate was dissolved in 1981, and in its place the Israeli military established the Israeli Civil Administration. The military order establishing the Israeli Civil Administration, military order 947, specified that \\"the Civil Administration shall administer civilian affairs ... with regard to the welfare and benefit of the population.\\" Meron Benvenisti argues that this transition marked the transformation of the occupation from a temporary into a permanent system. The military closely supervised elections in local clubs, cooperatives or charitable organizations. West Bank lawyers were banned on security grounds from organizing professionally a bar association. Palestinians were denied direct political representation after 1976, and instead, village Leagues (rawabit al-qura) were introduced, and furnished by Israeli with arms and militias. These Leagues had a short life: their appointees were considered to be quislings by General Binyamin Ben- Eliezer and collaborationists by the local population, and to have been recruited from people who were lazy or had criminal backgrounds. With the Oslo Accords, Israel negotiated with the Palestinian Liberation Organization a provisory agreement which left the latter some autonomy in Area A, mixed regulation of Area B, and total Israeli administration of the largest zone, Area C. Israel retains a right to operate militarily in all three zones, but security issues have a bilateral dimension that had led a number of critics to argue that effectively the Palestinian National Authority has become Israel's subcontractor in the occupation. According to an analysis by the Israeli think tank Molad in 2017, Israel deploys from 50% to 75% of its active IDF forces in the West Bank, while only one third deals with Arab states, Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas and other perceived external threats 80% of the former defend settlements, while 20% handle any behavior that Israel considers a security threat, including terrorism. =Israeli security concerns= The occupation has, according to some Israeli researchers, produced an ethos of conflict of which perceived security concerns, at times perplexing to outsiders, are a central feature. Although security is a fundamental Israeli preoccupation, the state has never formalized an official national security policy or doctrine. Before June 1967, the Israeli cabinet did not regard the West Bank as having a \\"vital security value\\". Before the war ended, the IDF's research department under Shlomo Gazit drew up a proposal to pullback almost completely from the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for a peace treaty, since, they concluded, there was no need for retaining any territory on security grounds. The document was ignored. It was in the wake of the conquest, that secure defensible borders became a keynote of Israel's foreign policy. Four schools of thought came to dominate the question of the acquired territories. Two were closely linked to strategic questions of security. The territorialist approach, associated with Yigal Allon's Allon Plan (1967‚Äì1970), would have annexed all of the West Bank south of Jerusalem and the lowland border along the Jordan River, and excluded areas closer to the pre-1967 border, which had a high density of Palestinians. The functionalist view, associated with Moshe Dayan and later Simon Peres, foresaw setting up 5 army bases along the Jordan ridges, which also left the Palestinians in between with a degree of autonomy, though constrained to accept the presence of Israelis among them. From 1968 to 1977 Labour governments facilitated a number of settlements designed to form a bulwark against the threat of future mass tank assaults from Jordan and Iraq. The third approach, associated with Menachem Begin and the Likud party, is annexationist, and with the ascendency of Likud, the biblical resonance of West Bank territory outweighed questions of security significance in driving an expansion of settlements, though both Likud and Gush Emunim came to oppose Palestinian independence on security grounds and treated West Bank Palestinians as either potential enemies or security threats, by arguing that national autonomy would develop into a basis for PLO aggression. The fourth position, associated with Abba Eban, Pinhas Sapir and Yehoshafat Harkabi is reconciliationist, being opposed to the idea of \\"Fortress Israel\\". Its proponents do not generally consider retention of the West Bank indispensable for guaranteeing Israel's security interests, with Harkabi, a former head of military intelligence, advocating withdrawal to the 1967 borders in exchange for a negotiated settlement with the PLO. The West Bank was considered a bargaining chip in securing a broad peace treaty with Arab nations. In time, especially after the Sinai withdrawal, and suggestions the Golan Heights were also negotiable, the idea of retaining territory for strategic interests dwindled in importance, as a military anachronism in an age of missile warfare. The military arguments for retaining ground were supplanted by political considerations, that Arab acquiescence in agreed on borders is of greater importance, and that settlements, formerly placed along possible invasion routes, were no longer functional for security, if they were an obstacle to peace. The Oslo Accords, moreover, had set in place a Palestinian security apparatus that, as Yitzhak Rabin acknowledged, worked with Israel to safeguard Israel's security interests. Over half of the Israeli public believes settlements reinforce Israel's security. In recent years, numerous top defense experts disagree, dismissing the idea as a myth or outdated illusion. 106 retired Israeli Generals, such as Eyal Ben-Reuven, Moshe Kaplinsky and Gadi Shamni, and Shin Bet heads such as Yuval Diskin have publicly opposed Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that an independent state of Palestine would be a security threat, arguing variously that holding millions of Palestinians under occupation on ostensible security-related grounds, rather than pursuing an overall peace plan with Arab countries, endangers Israel's future. Territory Israel extended its jurisdiction over East Jerusalem on 28 June 1967, suggesting internally it was annexed while maintaining abroad that it was simply an administrative move to provide services to residents. The move was deemed \\"null and void\\" by the United Nations Security Council. The elected Arab council was disbanded, and a number of services provided by Palestinian companies were transferred to their Israeli competitors. The population ratio for this united Jerusalem was set ideally as 76% Jewish and 24% Arab, and Jewish Israeli settlers were given a 5-year tax exemption, not applied to Palestinian Jerusalemites, who were placed in a high income tax bracket, and paid for 26% of municipal services while receiving 5% of the benefits. The Palestinian areas were encircled by Jewish new town developments which effectively closed them off from expansion, and services to the latter were kept low so that after decades, basic infrastructure was left in neglect, with shortages of schools, inadequate sewage and garbage disposal. By 2017, 370,000 lived in the overcrowded Arab areas, living under strict restrictions on their daily movement and commerce. One 2012 report stated that the effect of Israeli policies was that, amidst flourishing modern Jewish settlements, the Arab sector had been allowed to decay into a slum where criminals, many of them collaborators, thrived. In 2018 legislative measures were announced to strip a further 12,000 Palestinians of their right to live in East Jerusalem. Israel's policies regarding the use of land in the rest of the West Bank display three interlocking aspects, all designed around a project of Judaization of what was Palestinian territory. These policies consist in (a) planning for land use (b) expropriations of land and (c) the construction of settlements. =Area C= Area C in blue. East Jerusalem in red The \\"Letters of Mutual Recognition\\" accompanying the \\"Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self- Government Arrangements\\" (the DOP), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, provided for a transitional period not exceeding five years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Major critics of these arrangements, headed by Raja Shehadeh, argue that the PLO had scarce interest or competence in the legal implications of what it was signing. These Oslo Accords ceded nominal control of a small amount of the West Bank to a Palestinian authority, with a provisory division of the land, excluding East Jerusalem, into 3 areas: Area A (18% of territory, 55% of population), Area B (20% of territory, 41% of the population), and Area C (62% of territory, 5.8% of population). Israel never finalized the undertaking with regard to Area C to transfer zoning and planning from the Israeli to the Palestinian authorities within five years and all administrative functions continued to remain in its hands. Tactically, the Accord lessened Israel's problem with large-scale demonstrations since the areas of ostensible PA control were fragmented into 165 islands containing 90% of the Palestinian population, all surrounded by the spatially contiguous 60% of the West Bank where the PA was forbidden to venture. Israel then reasserted in 2000 a right to enter, according to \\"operational needs\\", Area A where most West Bank Palestinians live and which is formally under PA administration, meaning they still effectively control all the West Bank including areas under nominal PA authority. According to the United Nations special rapporteur on Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories, Michael Lynk, the policies applied by Israel indicate an intention to annex totally Area C, which has 86% of the nature reserves, 91% of the forests, 48% of the wells and 37% of the springs in the West Bank. Early economic impact of occupation The early occupation set severe limits on public investment and comprehensive development programmes in the territories. British and Arab commercial banks operating in the West Bank were closed down soon after Israel assumed power there. Bank Leumi then opened nine branches, without successfully replacing the earlier system. Farmers could get loans, but Palestinian businessmen avoided taking out loans from them since they charged 9% compared to 5% interest in Jordan. Land confiscations led to rural labour seeking employment, even if mainly menial, in Israel, causing a labour scarcity in the West Bank, and their remittances were the major factor in Palestinian economic growth during the 1969-73 boom years, The Israeli licensing system stipulated no industrial plant could be built without obtaining a prior Israeli permit, which was often tied to security concerns. Entrepreneurs were denied a permit for a cement factory in Hebron, melon production was forbidden, imports of grapes and dates banned, to protect Israeli farmers, and limits were set to how many cucumbers and tomatoes could be produced. Israeli milk producers exerted pressure on the Ministry for Industry and Trade to stop the establishment of a competitive dairy in Ramallah. Ian Lustick states that Israel \\"virtually prevented\\" Palestinian investment in local industry and agriculture. Two decades later, 90% of West Bank imports came from Israel, with consumers paying more than they would for comparable products had they been able to exercise commercial autonomy =Land seizure mechanisms= In 1968 a military order stopped attempts by Palestinians to register their land, while permitting Israel to register areas as state land with its own Custodian of Enemy Property. From 1967 to 1983, Israel expropriated over 52% of the West Bank, most of its prime agricultural land and, by the eve of 1993 Oslo Accords, these confiscations had encompassed over three-quarters of the territory. The mechanisms by which Israel seizes or expropriates West Bank land were set forth in a detailed work by B'Tselem in 2002. Many practices outlined there were confirmed in the official Israeli Sasson Report of 2005, which focused on government subsidies and support for the creation of illegal Israeli outposts in knowing contravention of Israel's own laws. Under international law, a military may take temporary possession of occupied land, but not expropriate it. From 1957 to 1976 the IDF repeatedly requisitioned private Palestinian properties on the grounds of military necessity, only to turn them over for Jewish settlements, such as Matitiyahu, Neve Tzuf, Rimonim, Bet El, Kokhav Hashahar, Alon Shvut, El'azar, Efrat, Har Gilo, Migdal Oz, Gittit, Yitav and Qiryat Arba. This practice, after Palestinians appealed was blocked by the High Court in the case of Elon Moreh (1979). Thereafter, the Ottoman Land Law of 1858 which enabled the sovereign to seize certain types of land, though much private land had not been registered to avoid taxes or military service with the Ottomans. Thirdly, land temporally abandoned during the 1967 was deemed absentee property came under trusteeship, but since Israel rarely allows refugees to return. If a claim is made, but the Custodian has sold it to a settler group in the meantime, the sale cannot be nullified even if invalid. Fourthly, land expropriated for public need under Jordanian law required notification, time for appeal, and royal approval. Israel modified this by delegating the power to regional military commanders, and by abolishing the requirement to publish the intention to expropriate in an official gazette. Appeals were dealt with no longer local courts but by the military court system. Lastly, land sales were subject to severe restrictions, except for purchases by the Jewish National Fund. Palestinians regard sale of their to Jews as treasonable, so the law was altered to enable Jewish buyers to withhold registration of property acquired from Palestinians for 15 years. Many fraudulent practices in this regard flourished until they were formally stopped by law in 1985. One estimate put the amount of unalienable Islamic property dedicated to pious ends confiscated by Israel at over 600,000 dunams. Settlement Israeli settlement of Carmel, Har Hebron Umm al-Khair Palestinian village near Carmel Ariel Sharon viewed the primary function of settling the West Bank as one of precluding the possibility of the formation of a Palestinian state, and his aim in promoting the 1982 invasion of Lebanon was to secure perpetual control of the former. As of 2017, excluding East Jerusalem, 382,916 Israelis have settled in the West Bank, and 40% (approximately 170,000 in 106 other settlements) live outside the major settlement blocs, where 214,000 reside. A continuity has often been observed between the Realpolitik processes governing the creation of Israel and the practices adopted with regard to the West Bank. Several analysts have likened the process to enclosure ‚Äì the \\"establishment of exclusionary Jewish spaces on the Palestinian landscape\\" being heir to the English appropriation of common land and its conversion to private use ‚Äì or to the conversion of Amerindian land into \\"white property\\". Early Zionist policy for land appropriation was outlined by Menachem Ussishkin in 1904 and, aside from voluntary sales, foresaw the need also to seize land by war and compel sale through expropriation via the ruling authority. It called this practice \\"colonization\\", a word which, since 1967, has been replaced by the euphemism \\"settlement.\\" The technique developed over the decades of early settlement was one of incremental spread, setting up tower-and-stockade outposts, a pattern repeated in the West Bank after 1967. A quote attributed to Joseph Trumpeldor summed up Zionist logic: \\"Wherever the Jewish plow plows its last furrow, that is where the border will run\\". The principle of this slow steady establishing of \\"facts on the ground\\" before the adversary realizes what is going on, is colloquially known as \\"dunam after dunam, goat after goat\\". The model applied to the West Bank was that used for the Judaization of the Galilee, consisting of setting up a checkered pattern of settlements not only around Palestinian villages but in between them. In addition to settlements considered legal, with government sponsorship, there are some 90 Israeli outposts (2013) built by private settler initiatives which, though illegal even in Israeli terms, are defended by the IDF. From the mid-1990s to 2015 many of these, such as Amona, Avri Ran's Giv'ot Olam and Ma'ale Rehav'am ‚Äì the latter on 50 dunams of private Palestinian land ‚Äì were directly funded, according to Haaretz, by loans from the World Zionist Organization through Israeli taxpayer money, since its approximate $140 million income derives from Israel and is mostly invested in settlements in the West Bank. The first site chosen for settlement was Gush Etzion, on some worked by Palestinian refugees. Hanan Porat was inspirational, intending by developing the settlement in order to put in place a practical application of the radical messianic Zionism of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, whose father Abraham Isaac Kook's Mercaz HaRav yeshiva in particular has exercised considerable influence on Israel's policies regarding the West Bank. According to Eyal Benvenisti, a 1972 judgement by Supreme Court justice Moshe Landau, siding with a military commander's decision to assign electrical supply in the Hebron area to the Israel Electric Corporation rather than to a Palestinian company, was to prove pivotal to encouraging the settlement project, since it placed the latter under the jurisdiction of the military authorities. During the first decade of Israel occupation, when the Israeli Labour Party held power, settlement was concentrated on constructing a ring of \\"residential fortresses\\" around the Palestinian population of Jerusalem, and in the Jordan Valley. According to Ibrahim Matar, the purpose of this colonizing strategy around Jerusalem was to hem in and block the expansion of the Palestinian population, and to incentivize Palestinian emigration by inducing a sense among the Palestinians a sense of living in a ghetto. Between 1967 and 1977, settlement was small-scale totaling the transfer of 3,200 Israelis into the West Bank. By the end of Labour's term of power in 1977, 4,500 Israelis had established themselves in 30 West Bank settlements and some 50,000 in settlements in East Jerusalem. It was with the rise to power of Menachem Begin's Likud Party, driven by a \\"Greater Israel theology\\" that year, which led to an incremental expansion of this projects, and marked in the view of Oren Yiftachel the peak of Israel's ethnocratic project, with the West Bank to become \\"the bedrock of Jewish national identity\\". A change in territorial focus took place, with settlements now promoted in the biblical heartland of the West Bank next to Palestinian population centres. The main plank of Likud's platform, still unaltered, called for the immediate annexation of the West Bank. If security calculations influenced the relatively small-scale settlements advanced by the Israeli Labour Party, the reconfirmation of Likud in 1981 led to a rapid escalation of settlement as a religious-national programme. The local Palestinian press was forbidden by the military censors at the same time from reporting any news about settlements, expropriations or legal moves made to block them. By 1983, settlers in the West Bank numbered 28,400. Incentives consisting of government mortgage and housing subsidies, tax incentives, business grants, free schooling, infrastructure projects, and defense were provided. After the Oslo Accords down to 2002, the settler population doubled. In 1972 the number of Israeli settlers in Area C were 1,200, in 1993 110,000, and in 2010 310,000 (excluding East Jerusalem). Before 1967 there were between 200,000 and 320,000 Palestinians in the Jordan Valley, which, together with the northern Dead Sea, covers 30% of the West Bank and constituted the \\"most significant land reserve\\" for Palestinians, 85% of whom are barred from entering it. By 2011, 37 settlements had been established among the 64,451 Palestinians there (who constitute 29 communities) 70% of whom live in Area A in Jericho. According to ARIJ, by 2015 only 3 of 291 Palestinian communities in Area C received Israeli building approval (on just 5.7 hectares), and any construction outside that was subject to demolition. In that one year, they calculate, Israel confiscated a further 41,509 hectares, demolished 482 homes ‚Äì displacing 2,450 people ‚Äì uprooted 13,000 trees, and subjected Palestinians and their property to assault on some 898 distinct occasions. Israeli settlements constituted 6% of the land, while military zones had been declared over 29%. From 1967 to 2003, successive Israeli governments assisted the transfer of some 230,000 Jewish civilians into 145 West Bank and Gaza settlements and approximately 110 outposts. By 2016, approximately 42% of the settlement workforce (55,440) found employment in those settlements. The ultra-Orthodox have dominated the process from the beginning: from 2003 to 2007 alone the population of Beitar Illit, whose construction was facilitated by the expropriation of 1,500 dunams of Na·∏•·∏•ƒÅlƒ´n farmland, rose 40%, while Modi'in Illit, built on the Palestinian village lands of Ni'lin, Kharbata, Saffa, Bil'in and Dir Qadis, increased by 55%. The majority of Israeli West Bank agriculture arises from contracts with the World Zionist Organization that bypass direct contracts with the Israeli Land Regulating Commissioner, and many were given to use private Palestinian land. With the Regularization Law of 2017, Israel retroactively legalized the settler takeover of thousands of hectares of privately owned Palestinian land and some 4,500 homes which settlers had built without obtaining official permits. By that year, the fifth decade of occupation, Israel had managed to establish (2017) 237 settlements, housing roughly 580,000 settlers. One technique used to established settlements was to set up a paramilitary encampment for army personnel to be used for agricultural and military training for soldiers. These were then slowly transformed into civilian settlements, often without official approval. This could be justified as legal because they were initially IDF bases without civilians. Another technique was to render land momentarily unusable. Gitit for example was established by closing off 5,000 dunams of the village lands of Aqraba and then spraying it with defoliants. On occasion, creating settlements is hailed as a measure to punish Palestinians collectively, as a reaction to a Palestinian killing of a settler, or in response to the granting of non-member observer status to the Palestinian State by the United Nations, an announcement which generated plans for a further 3,000 settler homes in the West Bank. Economic motivations also drive settlement: if one sells one's 50-60 sq. m. apartment in Jerusalem, one can purchase with less than the sale proceeds an apartment three times larger in settlements like Ma‚Äôaleh Adumim. One early metaphor likened the expansion of settlements to the baobab tree in The Little Prince, whose seeds take root and eventually cover the entire planet. By the early eighties, several authoritative observers, among them Eyal Benvenisti, already concluded that the settlement expansion was close to a point of no return from total annexation. The impression left of the landscape has been described as follows: > Israeli settlements form an upper-middle-class oasis of green grass, > shopping malls, and swimming pools amidst open desert and enclaves of > Palestinian refugee camps, villages, and towns with limited access to water. American citizens lead the diaspora in moving into West Bank settlements, with 12% stating their first choice of residency is \\"Judea and Samaria\\". They now form the predominant block and number an estimated 60,000. =Legal status= Before proceeding with settlement, the government sought legal advice from their resident expert on international law, Theodor Meron. His top secret memorandum stated unequivocally that the prohibition on any such population transfer was categorical, and that \\"civilian settlement in the administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\\" indicating that the Prime Minister Levi Eshkol was therefore aware the promotion of settlements in the West Bank would be illegal. The International community has also since rejected Israel's unwillingness to accept the applicability of the Geneva Conventions to the territories it occupies, with most arguing all states are duty bound to observe them. Israel alone challenges this premise, arguing that the West Bank and Gaza are \\"disputed territories\\", and that the Conventions do not apply because these lands did not form part of another state's sovereign territory, and that the transfer of Jews into areas like the West Bank is not a government act but a voluntary movement by Israeli Jewish people, not acting under compulsion, a position contested by Yoram Dinstein. The International Court of Justice also determined that Israeli settlements in the West Bank were established in breach of international law in their 2004 advisory opinion on the West Bank barrier. In 1980, Israel declined to sign the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which obliges national laws to give way to international law when the two conflict, and regulates settlements in terms of its own laws, in lieu of any compulsion to observe its treaty commitments and by arguing that all the relevant UN bodies adjudicating the matter are \\"anti-Zionist and anti- Semitic\\". =Settler violence= Price Tag.\\" Hebrew Graffiti spray-painted by Israeli settlers in Urif \\"No more administrative orders.\\" Graffiti spray- painted in Hebrew by Israeli settlers on a car in Fara'ata, 2018 Though settler vigilantism dates back to the late 1970s, when they were authorized to bear arms in self-defense ‚Äì one ordinance exempted them from military service in Israel while drafting them into West Bank units and another gave them powers to demand Palestinians provide identification and even to arrest them ‚Äì settler terrorism formally dates back at least to the Jewish Underground movement of the early 1980s, which began by targeting and severely maiming, through the deployment of car bombs, West Bank mayors such as Bassam Shakaa of Nablus, and Karim Khalaf of Ramallah. In the first 2 years of the First Intifada, settlers killed at least 34 Palestinians, 4 below the age of 16, with 11 killed by settler initiative at home or while guarding flocks; a further 6 probably died through settler actions, and 8 were killed in response to stone throwing at cars. Only two died as a result of clashes. In the 1980s attempts by one Jewish terrorist group led by Meir Kahane to set up settlements were blocked by other settlers, the heads of Gush Emunim, though Kahane's views would later motivate the Cave of the Patriarchs Massacre. From 2009 such settler violence escalated rapidly, an uptick that coincided with a dramatic fall in Palestinian terror attacks. In 2009, 200 settler attacks took place, a figure which doubled to over 400 by 2011. Of the latter, nearly 300 consisted in attacks on Palestinian property, causing 100 Palestinian casualties, and the destruction of roughly 10,000 trees. Many of these are carried out as Price tag acts, which target innocent Palestinians and are designed to intimidate the local population. Yesh Din discovered that of 781 such incidents covered from 2005 to 2011, 90% of the Israeli investigations were closed without laying indictments, and many of the culprits were Hilltop Youth. In an analysis of 119 cases of settlers killing Palestinians, it emerged that only 13 were sent to gaol: 6 were convicted of murder, only one of whom was sentenced to life imprisonment, while of 7 convicted of manslaughter, 1 received a prison sentence of 7 and a half years for killing a child, and the rest got off with light sentences. Writing in 2012, Daniel Byman and Natan Sachs judged that the pattern of settler violence was \\"undoubtedly working\\" and achieving its ends, by influencing the way Palestinians view Israelis, strengthening the hand of terrorists among them, and by seeding fears in the Israeli government that any pullout in exchange for peace will lead to conflict with settlers and a political disaster for the political parties involved. State of asymmetric war West Bank Palestinians have engaged in two uprisings that have led to an asymmetric set of wars of attrition, between the occupying power and the occupied people. This characterization has been further refined by classifying the conflict as structurally asymmetric, where the root cause of tension lies in the standoff between a colonizer and the colonized, and in which the large power imbalance in favour of the dominator leads to a resort to guerilla tactics or terrorism by the dominated.Much of what Palestinians defend as acts of \\"resistance\\" are, in Israeli usage, regarded as \\"terrorism\\". Making speeches calling on fellow Palestinians to resist the occupation is construed in Israeli law as tantamount to advocacy of terrorism. In the case of the parliamentarian Azmi Bishara, he was stripped of his immunity rights in the Knesset in order to pave the way for a criminal indictment on this charge. International law does not address the issue regarding the rights of an occupied people to resist an occupation which flagrantly violates fundamental human rights. The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514 established that force may not be used to deny self-determination, and that recourse to force to resist colonial or alien domination is legitimate. The two fundamental preconditions for containing conflict ‚Äì clearly defined borders and rough power parity between the parties at war ‚Äì are absent, with a pronounced economic and military disparity favouring Israel. The disparity extends, according to Nathan Thrall, to the numerous negotiations over a peace settlement. According to Aharon Klieman, even Israeli negotiating tactics with Palestinians follow the principles of warfare used by the IDF. =Armaments (Israel)= In terms of armaments, Israel is reputed to have \\"the strongest and best-equipped army of the Middle East\\" The arsenal at Israel's disposal to counteract major Palestinian uprisings ranges from F-16 fighters, Merkava tanks, Apache helicopters, Hellfire missiles, massive armoured D9 Caterpillar bulldozers. to the standard M-16 rifle and the use of snipers. The Israeli techniques for daily dispersing protesting crowds differ according to the ethnicity of the protestors. With Jewish settlers by and large the methods are those policing approaches used in Western countries, and they are reported as not intervening when settlers go on the rampage against Palestinians. With Palestinians, contrariwise, military tactics are adopted, and observers such as B'Tselem claim lack of proportionality and recourse to firearms is characteristic. With the latter at demonstrations Israeli forces have drawn on rash gas, tear gas canisters (which have often produced fatalities); shooting into crowds with rubber-coated steel bullets, which can be lethal; high-velocity bullets; recourse to the use of live ammunition rounds; the deployment from 2008 of trucks dousing whole areas with putrid Skunk spray; stun grenades; water cannons; pepper spray; capsaisin projectiles; deployment of snatch squads and mista'arvim and sponge rounds. The use of rubber-coated metal bullets is allowed in the West Bank but forbidden from deployment against people within Israel. Also deployed on occasion since 2005 when they were used at Bil‚Äôin, are loud sound-wave generating devices, gravel-throwing machines; shock- inducing polystyrene and bismuth metal paintball pellets, and tasars. In the first Intifada, snipers targeted youths primarily to maim them, with dum dum shots to the right arm biceps crippling their use by stone-throwers for life. =Armaments (Palestinians)= The primary value developed by Palestinians to resist the occupation from 1967 has been ·π£um≈´d, hanging on stubbornly, a steadfast perseverance in remaining on one's land, even if it turns into a prison, in the face of Jewish hitnahalut (settlement). The word itself was consistently repressed from Palestinian papers by Israeli censors in the early decades. Mubarak Awad, founder of the Palestinian Centre for the Study of Nonviolence, endeavoured to inculcate Gandhian principles of non-violence in the West Bank, and was subsequently expelled and sent into exile by Israel on the grounds he preached non-violence as a cover an armed struggle for liberation. The village of Bil'in, one of the first villages, along with Budrus and Abu Dis, to practice Gandhian methods of non-violent resistance, has in one decade (2005‚Äì2015) been subjected to incessant night raids, seen hundreds of its residents arrested, its leader Abdullah Abu Rahmeh put on trial 5 times and sentenced to imprisonment, and thousands of demonstrators injured. The mainstay of Palestinian armed resistance techniques to the occupation during the First Intifada, which was generally non-lethal, consisted of throwing stones during clashes with at Israeli troops, or at military and settler vehicles bearing their distinctive yellow number plates, together with tire-burning, hurling Molotov cocktails and setting up roadblocks. The then Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's policy was that, \\"rioters must emerge with casualties or scars.\\" The juxtaposition of this primitive method with Israeli power was striking, with children and youths throwing stones and deploying slingshots against a fully equipped and highly trained military power exerting overwhelming superiority. Years later, a spiral in escalation led to the increased use of knifing and Palestinian suicide attacks corresponding to the expansion of deployment of warplanes, helicopters, and recourse to assassinations by Israel. In the Al-Aqsa Intifada, suicide bombers, among which youths figured prominently, were deployed and became a central feature from 2001 to 2005, of the second uprising. Aside from the PLO's Fatah, many armed militant factions, Marxist, Islamic or otherwise, became involved, such as the Tanzim, the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, Hamas, Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Popular Resistance Committees. This flared up into a large- scale military confrontation when, according to Ma'ariv, 700,000 rounds of ammunition were fired at West Bank crowds protesting the shooting of Palestinians in and around the Haram al-Sharif, killing 118 Palestinians, of whom 33 were teenagers. From 2001 to 2007 Israel killed more Palestinians annually than it had over the first two decades of occupation, averaging 674 as opposed to the earlier 32 per year. Kill ratios between the first and second intifada differ markedly. 1 Israeli was killed for every 25 Palestinians in the first, whereas the figure for the first year of the second the ratio varied from 1 Israeli to 2.5/3 Palestinians. The earlier ratio of 25:1 was only reestablished by 2007. The overall historic pattern of Palestinian violence in comparative terms, according to Nathan Thrall, appears to be far less participatory and deadly than other examples of local resistance to a foreign occupation. The four major outbreaks all began in civic demonstrations and strikes which, when violently repressed, led to a resort to violence. Technologies of control Ben Ehrenreich, citing Gudrun Kr√§mer's description of the British military suppression of the 1936 Palestinian Revolt, states that, aside from caning, all of the extreme measures adopted by the Mandatory authorities recur as standard practices in the way Israel manages the occupied territories. Scholars differ regarding how to classify the techniques of segregation and exclusion used to further Israeli control over the West Bank. For Jan Selby, there are five central planks to consolidate territorial colonization: (a) settlement construction; (b) land confiscation and engineering a bypass road network (c) drawing the local economy into dependence on Israel's larger one; (d) the creation of a dual legal system with different laws for Palestinians and Jewish settlers, with subsidies favouring the latter and (e) seeking local clients and patrons who would act according to Israel's bidding, and, in lieu of success in this regard, increased repression. Gershon Shafir has discerned a matrix of five technologies of Israeli domination over Palestinians (a) the permit system; (b) administrative detention; (c)deportation: (d) house demolitions, and (e) torture. Richard Falk adds political assassinations, extrajudicial punishments and the use of collective punishment to the list. According to Neve Gordon, Israel uses lawfare \\"to encode the field of human rights and in this way (has) help(ed) frame human rights work in Israel as a security threat.\\" =Population transfer and deportations= Israel was one of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention dealing specifically with protection of civilians in a war zone, and, as a signatory, underwrote Article 49 which reads: > Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected > persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or > to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of > their motive... The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of > its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. This final clause is absolute, allowing of no exceptions, and was ratified by Israel when it signed the Geneva Conventions on 6 July 1951. The sentence was written to prevent the repetition of the practice of colonization established by certain powers, by which Germany was to be understood, of transferring their population to conquered territories for political and racial reasons in WW2. Furthermore, Article 76 of that convention excludes deportation as a punitive measure in stating that > protected persons accused of offences shall be detained in the occupied > country and, if convicted, they shall serve their sentences therein. The principle is unambiguous ‚Äì \\"an occupier cannot expel a single person, however much that person constitutes a security risk\\". According to one estimate, between 1967 and 1978 some 1,151 individuals were deported by Israel, including two whole tribes, dispatched into exile en masse from the area of the Jordan Valley in December 1967 and May 1969. To provide legal warrant for these measures, which contravene the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel applied law 112 going back to the British Mandatory government's Defence (Emergency) Regulations which predated the Geneva Convention by 4 years. These in turn went back to military legislation devised to counteract the Palestinian war of opposition to British occupation and Jewish immigration in 1936-1939. Fathers were most frequently affected in the early days: sundering families, the practice was arrest household heads at night in their homes and take them to a desert south of the Dead Sea where they were forced, at gunpoint or gunshot, to cross over into Jordan. To this day, any Palestinian Jerusalemite can have his or her residency revoked by Israeli law if Jerusalem has not constituted, in the view of the Israeli authorities, their \\"centre of life\\" for seven consecutive years, a revocation constituting a forced population transfer that has been applied to at least 14,595 Palestinians since 1967 (2016). The PLO, inspired by the precedent of the SS Exodus, once endeavoured to sail a \\"Ship of Return\\" into Haifa harbour with 135 Palestinians Israel had deported from the territories. Mossad assassinated with a car-bomb the three senior Fatah officials organizing the event in Limassol, and then sunk the ship in the port. The forced transfer of Palestinians still takes place in the West Bank: in 2018 the Israeli Supreme Court gave the green light to expel the people of Khan al-Ahmar from their township to a rubbish dump outside Abu Dis. Israel arrested at a checkpoint in February 2017 Maen Abu Hafez, a 23-year-old Palestinian, since he had no ID, and detained him under a deportation order in a prison for aliens in Ramla, Israel. He had been raised since the age of 3 in the Jenin Refugee Camp. Israel seeks to deport him to Brazil, though he speaks no Portuguese, his mother is Uruguayan and his Palestinian father deserted the family to return to Brazil in 1997 and has not been heard from since. Collective punishment Israel's use of collective punishment measures, such as movement restrictions, shelling of residential areas, mass arrests, and the destruction of public health infrastructure. violates Articles 33 and 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Article 33 reads in part: > No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not > personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of > intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited Collective punishment of Palestinians goes back to British mandatory techniques in suppressing the 1936-1939 revolt. and has been reintroduced and in effect since the early days of the occupation, and was denounced by Israel Shahak as early as 1974. Notoriety for the practice arose in 1988 when, in response to the killing of a suspected collaborator in the village, Israeli forces shut down Qabatiya, arrested 400 of the 7,000 inhabitants, bulldozed the homes of people suspected of involvement, cut all of its telephone lines, banned the importation of any form of food into the village or the export of stone from its quarries to Jordan, shutting off all contact with the outside world for almost 5 weeks (24 February-3 April). In 2016 Amnesty International stated that the various measures taken in the commercial and cultural heart of Hebron over 20 years of collective punishment have made life so difficult for Palestinians that thousands of businesses and residents have been forcibly displaced, enabling Jewish settlers to take over more properties. =House demolitions= Israeli military forces arriving to demolish the Palestinian community of Khirbet Ein Karzaliyah on 8 January 2014, rendering homeless the entire population of 10 adults and 15 minors; the military returned a month later to demolish tents in which residents were living since the last demolition House demolition is considered a form of collective punishment. According to the law of occupation, the destruction of property, save for reasons of absolute military necessity, is prohibited. The practice of demolishing Palestinian houses began within two days of the conquest of the area in the Old City of Jerusalem known as the Moroccan Quarter, adjacent to the Western Wall. From the outset of the occupation of the Palestinian territories down to 2015, according to an estimate by the ICAHD, it has been estimated that Israel has razed 48,488 Palestinian structures, with a concomitant displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Israel regards its practice as directed against houses built without Israeli permits or a form of deterrence of terrorism, since a militant is thereby forced to consider the effect of his actions on his family. Between September 2000 and the end of 2004, of the 4,100 homes the IDF razed in the territories, 628, housing 3,983 people were undertaken as punishment because a member of a family had been involved in the Al Aqsa insurgency. From 2006 until 31 August 2018, Israel demolished at least 1,360 Palestinian residential units in the West Bank (not including East Jerusalem), causing 6,115 people ‚Äì including at least 3,094 minors ‚Äì to lose their homes. 698 of these, homes to 2,948 Palestinians of whom 1,334 minors, were razed in the Jordan Valley (January 2006 ‚Äì September 2017). Even huts by shepherds, on which taxes have been duly paid, can be demolished. =Permit system= From 1967, almost every aspect of ordinary everyday Palestinian life was subject to pervasive military regulations, calculated to number of 1,300 by 1996, from planting trees and importing books, to house extensions. Military order 101 denied West Bankers the right to purchase any form of printed matter ‚Äì books, posters, photographs and even paintings ‚Äì from abroad (including from Israel) unless prior authorization had been obtained from the military. In the first two decades Palestinians were required to apply for permits and licenses for an enormous number of things such as a driver's license, a telephone, trademark and birth registration, and a good conduct certificate to secure jobs in numerous professions. Obtaining such permits has been described as a via dolorosa. The precise criteria to be satisfied for obtaining permits have never been clarified. It has been likened to the pass system of Apartheid. Zygmunt Bauman's warnings of the debilitating effect bureaucracy may have on the human condition has been cited to throw light on the Orwellian or Kafkaesque trap of red tape that, it is argued, places a stranglehold on Palestinian autonomy. There are 42 types of permits, depending on the purpose of one's movements, required by Israeli authorities as of 2018. =Impact on education= The high priority traditionally accorded education in Palestinian society continued over the early occupation, with, by 1979, Palestinians making up an estimated 10% of all Arab university graduates. During the first Intifada at one point Israel imposed a 19-month closure on all schools in the West Bank, including kindergartens, suggesting to at least one observer that Israel was intentionally aiming to disrupt the cognitive development of Palestinian youths. In the first two years of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, 100 schools were fired on by the IDF, some were bombed and others occupied as military outposts. In 2017, according to one estimate, Israel had issued either demolition or \\"stop work\\" orders affecting 55 West Bank schools. =Night raids= According to Major General Tal Rousso, the IDF undertakes operations \\"all the time, every night, in all divisions.\\" Israeli night raids are usually undertaken between 2 am and 4 am. The units, whose members are often masked and accompanied by dogs, arrive in full battle gear and secure entry by banging on doors or blowing them off their hinges. Surging blips in frequency may relate to rotation of new units into an area. Most occur in villages in close proximity to settlements. Such missions have several different purposes: to arrest suspects, conduct searches, map the internal structure of a dwelling, and photograph youths to improve recognition in future clashes. Laptops and cellphones are often seized, and, if returned, not infrequently damaged. Vandalism is commonplace, with looted objects given to needy soldiers or those on low pay, as in Operation Defensive Shield. Reports of stashes of money that go missing after a search are frequent. Many personal effects ‚Äì photos of children or families, watches, medals, football trophies, books, Qur'ans, jewelry ‚Äì are taken and stored away, and, according to one informant, intelligence officer trainees were allowed to take items of such Palestinian \\"memorabilia\\", called \\"booty,\\" from storerooms. After international protests, in February 2014 a pilot scheme was begun to issue summonses instead of arresting children at night, and last until December 2015 The purpose of mapping raids is, reportedly, to work out how an area looks from Palestinian angles for future planning to enable an option for \\"straw widows\\" operations (mounting ambushes from inside those homes). The practice by Israeli military units of raiding, making arrest in, and ransacking Palestinians homes deep in the night is a long-standing practice, persisting to the present day. In just three days over 21‚Äì23 January 2018, 41, 24 and 32 separate raids were made In 2006 Israel made 6,666 raids inside the occupied territories. In the first six months of 2007, 3,144 Israeli search/arrest raids were made in the West Bank the parents of 90% of minors arrested, blindfolded and handcuffed in night raids, were given no explanation for the abduction, nor information about where the child would be detained. In another study, 72.7% of children studied had witnessed night raids, the traumatic experience coming second after watching scenes of mutilated or wounded bodies on TV. An extrapolation from this figure would, according to the NGO WCLAC, suggest that since martial law was imposed in June 1967, over 65,000 night raids have been conducted by the Israeli military on Palestinian homes in the West Bank (not including East Jerusalem). =Arrests and administrative detention= An estimated 650,000 Palestinians were detained by Israel from 1967 to 2005, one in three of all Palestinians in the first two decades alone. The military court system, regarded as the institutional centerpiece of the occupation, treats Palestinians as \\"foreign civilians\\" and is presided over by Jewish Israeli judges drew on prior British Mandatory law, where its application to Jewish activists was vigorously protested by the yishuv representatives. Four provisions entail (a) long detention of suspects incommunicado (b) without access to a lawyer (c) coercive interrogation to obtain evidence and (d) the use of \\"secret evidence\\". Over this period, tens of thousands have been subject to administrative detention, whose rationale is to incarcerate suspects who, in conventional criminal law, might not be convictable. Taisir al-Arouri, a Bir Zeit University professor of Mathematics, was arrested at night on 21 April 1974 and released on 18 January 1978, after suffering 45 months of imprisonment without trial or charges being laid, only after Amnesty International issued a public protest. It was considered by one scholar in 1978 as an \\"an aberration of criminal justice\\" of a provisory nature. In 2017 Amnesty International, noted that \\"hundreds of Palestinians, including children, civil society leaders and NGO workers were regularly under administrative detention\\", and regards some, such as Khalida Jarrar and Ahmad Qatamesh, as prisoners of conscience. =Torture= States are obliged under the Fourth Geneva Convention to prevent torture, including mental suffering. According to Lisa Hajjar (2005) and Dr. Rachel Stroumsa, the director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, torture has been an abiding characteristic of Israeli methods of interrogation of Palestinians. Torture can be of two types, physical and psychological. Reports of torture emerged in the 1970s, and began to be documented in detail by the NGO Al-Haq in the mid 1980s. The 1987 the Landau Commission examined some abuses and concluded \\"moderate physical pressure\\" was acceptable. The practice was then banned by Israel's High Court, barring case-by-case authorizations by the Attorney- General. The Hebrew army slang term tertur is associated with policies introduced by Rafael Eitan, who ordered army troops and border police to engage in repeated arrests and the humiliation of large numbers of the Palestinian population in the territories. This refers to practices such as the wholesale roundups that took place whenever West Bank Arabs staged nationalist demonstrations. Israeli border police have been witnessed forcing Arabs to sing the Israeli national anthem, slap each other's faces and crawl and bark like dogs. The police have also arrested thousands of Arabs each year on \\"security\\" charges, which have ranged from blatant terrorism to simply reading blacklisted books.' =Children= Children detained by Golani Brigade soldiers in Hebron Palestinian girls having their school bags searched by Israeli soldiers in Tel Rumeida, Hebron Ill-treatment of Palestinian children in the Israeli military detention system appears to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized. According to a 2013 study by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, covering 10 years of allegations of the mistreatment of children in Israel's military practices in the West Bank, though International law requires that all children in contact with judicial systems be treated with dignity and respect at all times, the evidence from multiple outside observers over a decade suggests Palestinian children under Israel military detention suffer cruel and degrading treatment. In law, the prohibition against such practices is \\"absolute and unconditional,\\" and even security considerations or threats of war cannot override the rule. Children constitute half of the Palestinian population, and though often construed as \\"mute victims or misguided puppets\\", they actively engage in the resistance, with some arguing that in doing so they forfeit their rights. According to James Graff, Palestinian children comprise a notable segment of Palestinians targeted, and can be included in categories from which they are normally exempted, and be singled out as a group to be subject to traumatizing violence, and targeted in random shootings, gassings and violence by soldiers and by settlers sponsored by the state. According to the Swedish branch of Save the Children, between 23,600 and 29,900 children required medical treatment after suffering injuries from IDF beatings during the first two years of the First Intifada, a third of them aged 10 or under. Under Yitzhak Rabin's 19 January 1988 order to employ \\"might, power and beatings\\" and an interview in which he spoke of the need to \\"break their bones\\", beatings, which until then had usually been a hidden interrogation method, went public, until an outcry arose when journalists filmed the tactic, a scandal countered by issuing a ban on media entering the territories in the spring of 1988. Minors (16 years old and under) adding up to 5% of the child population constituted 35-40% of the 130,000 Palestinians who suffered serious injuries from Israeli troops in this uprising. Of 15-year-olds and under requiring medical treatment, 35% were injured by Israeli gunfire, 50% by beatings, and 14.5% suffered from tear gassing. From 2009 to 2018 Israel Security squads shot dead 93 Palestinian minors in West Bank clashes. In the period of the Al- Aqsa uprising, the ratios of those killed indicate that roughly 20- 25% were children on both sides, with the difference that Israeli fatalities were from incidents of body-bombing in which they were not the primary targets, whereas a substantial proportion of Palestinian children were killed by Israeli sniper gun-fire directed individually, according to Frank Afflitto. From September 2000-to December 2003, 109 children were killed by \\"one-shot wonders\\" in the head, 4 in the neck, and 56 by exclusive heart-chest shots. A further 90 were killed with two or three gunshot wounds. Overall, in the 3.25 years after the second uprising 427 children were shot dead by IDF forces and settlers. Notable cases of Palestinian children shot dead by Israeli soldiers are Iman Darweesh Al Hams, Khalil al-Mughrabi and Faris Odeh. Fragmentation The official \\"Master Plan for the Development of Samaria and Judea to the year 2010\\" (1983) foresaw the creation of a belt of concentrated Jewish settlements linked to each other and Israel beyond the Green line while disrupting the same links joining Palestinian towns and villages along the north‚Äìsouth highway, impeding any parallel ribbon development for Arabs and leaving the West Bankers scattered, unable to build up larger metropolitan infrastructure, and out of sight of the Israeli settlements. The result has been called a process of \\"enclavization,\\" ghettoization, typified most visibly by the enclosure of Qalqilya in a concrete wall, or what Ariel Sharon called the Bantustan model, an allusion to the apartheid system, and one which many argue, makes Israel's occupational policies not dissimilar, despite different origins, from the South African model. In particular it bears comparison to the policies applied in South Africa to the Transkei, a policy that may have a broader geopolitical reach, if the Yinon Plan is to be taken as an indication of Israeli policy. The World Bank argued in 2009 that creating economic islands in the West Bank and Gaza is a developmental dead-end that would only imperil the construction of an economically unified and viable Palestinian state. One observed function of the Separation Barrier is to seize large swathes of land thought important for future settlement projects, notoriously in the case of the area of Susya absorbing land worked by Bedouin herders with proven Ottoman title to the terrain. The construction, significantly inspired by the ideas of Arnon Soffer to \\"preserve Israel as an Island of Westernization in a Crazy Region\\", had as its public rationale the idea of defending Israel against terroristic attacks, but was designed at the same time to incorporate a large swathe of West Bank Territory, much of it private Palestinian land: 73% of the area marked for inclusion into Israel was arable, fertile, and rich in water, formerly constituting the \\"breadbasket of Palestine\\". Had the barrier been constructed along the Green Line with the same purpose it would have run 313 kilometres, instead of 790 kilometres, and have cost far less than the $3.587 billion the extended wall is estimated to cost (2009). The disparity arises from the government's decision to rope in dozens of settlements west of the barrier. That it remains unfinished is said to be due to pressure from settler lobbies opposed to a completion that would restrict the further expansion of settlements or cut them off from Israel, as with Gush Etzion. There are only 12 gates through the 168 kilometres of the wall surrounding East Jerusalem, of which in theory four allow access to West Bankers who manage to obtain a permit. A whole generation of West Bankers have never seen the city, or the Haram al Sharif, a denial of international law stipulating the right of access to sites of worship. =Legal system= The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is characterized by a legal asymmetry, which embodies a fragmented jurisdiction throughout the West Bank, where ethnicity determines what legal system one will be tried under. Down to 1967, people in the West Bank lived under one unified system of laws applied by a single judicial system. State law (qanun) is a relatively alien concept in Palestinian culture, where a combination of the Shari'a and customary law (urf) constitutes the normal frame of reference for relations within the basic social unity of the clan (\\"hamula\\"). Settlers are subject to Israeli civil law, Palestinians to the occupying arm's military law. Overall the Israeli system has been described as one where \\"Law, far from limiting the power of the state, is merely another way of exercising it.\\" A Jewish settler can be detained up to 15 days, a Palestinian can be detained without charges being laid for 160 days. According to the legal framework of international law, a local population under occupation should continue to be bound by its own penal laws and tried in its own courts. However, under security provisions, local laws can be suspended by the occupying power and replaced with military orders enforced by military courts In 1988, Israel amended its Security Code in such a way that international law could no longer be invoked before the military judges in their tribunals. The High Court upheld only one challenge to the more than 1,000 arbitrary military orders that had been imposed from 1967 down to 1990 and that are legally binding in the occupied territories. Israeli businesses in the West Bank employing Palestinian labour drew up employment laws according to Jordanian law. This was ruled in 2007 by the Israeli Supreme Court to be discriminatory, and that Israeli law must apply in this area, but as of 2016, according to Human Rights Watch, the ruling has yet to be implemented, and the government states that it cannot enforce compliance. =Freedom of movement= Routine check of a Palestinian man by Israeli soldiers at checkpoint in Hebron The Universal Declaration of Human Rights establishes freedom of movement as a fundamental human right. It has been said that for \\"Jewish settlers, roads connect; for Palestinians, they separate.\\" Between 1994 and 1997, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) built 180 miles of bypass roads in the territories, on appropriated land because they ran close to Palestinian villages. The given aim was said to be to afford protection to settlers from Palestinian sniping, bombing, and drive-by shootings. Permanent and flying checkpoints (some 327 a month in 2017), barriers and restrictive networks restructure the West Bank into \\"land cells\\", freezing the flow of normal everyday Palestinian lives. TAU emeritus professor Elisha Efrat argues they form an apartheid network of \\"octopus arms which hold a grip on Palestinian population centres\\" A large number of embankments, concrete slabs, manned checkpoints, mounds, trenches, iron gates, fences, and walls impede movement on primary and secondary roads. The result was to cantonize and fragment Palestinian townships, and cause endless obstacles to Palestinians going to work, schools, markets and relatives. Women have died or had miscarriages while waiting for permission at a checkpoint to go to hospital. The World Bank that the impact of restrictions on movement for workers cost roughly US$229 million per annum (2007) while additional costs from the circuitous routes people must drive totaled US$185 million in 2013. In one village, Kafr Qaddum, soldiers from the Nahal Brigade planted explosive devices on a tract of land where demonstrators gather, as a 'deterrence' measure: they were removed when a 7-year-old child was injured playing with one. =Village closures= Demonstration against road block, Kafr Qaddum, March 2012 The closure (Hebrew seger, Arabic ighlaq) policy operates on the basis of a pass system developed in 1991, and is divided into two types: a general closure restriction the movement of goods and people, except when a permit is given, from and to Israel and the West Bank and Gaza, developed in response to a series of stabbings in the former 1993, and the implementation of total closure over both areas. Aside from general closures, total closures were imposed for over 300 days from September 1993 after the Declaration of Principles of the Oslo I Accord and late June 1996. The strictest total closure was put in place in the spring of 1996 in the wake of a series of the suicide bombings executed by the Gaza-Strip based organization of Hamas in retaliation for the assassination of Yahya Ayyash, when the Israeli government imposed a total 2-week long ban on any movement by over 2 million Palestinians between 465 West Bank towns and villages, a measure repeated after the deadly clashes arising from the archaeological excavations under the Western Wall of the Haram al Sharif/Temple Mount. The IDF erected iron gates at the entrances to the overwhelming majority of Palestinian villages, allowing the army to shut them down at will, in minutes. Notable examples of villages that have undergone long term isolation, with residents suffering extreme restrictions on movement, are Nuaman, which was absorbed into the Jerusalem municipality while having its inhabitants classified as West Bankers, and Kafr Qaddum which has had a permanent roadblock at its entrance for 14 years, from 2003, the same time the settlement of Kedumim was established, and since 2011 its villagers have been protesting the roadblock, which requires them to travel a distance six times greater than the usual route to access Nablus. Towards the end of the Gulf War in Kuwait, Israel again imposed a curfew on the West Bank (and Gaza) lasting seven weeks, causing devastating economic setbacks, with thousands of Palestinians fired from their jobs in Israel. Nablus was subject to total curfews for 200 days in two years (2002‚Äì2004). During house raids, windows and doors were smashed, food stocks mashed up into an indistinct mush; grain stores, TVs, solar panels, water tanks and radios destroyed or impounded. It is routine for the Israeli authorities to impose a comprehensive closure over the West Bank during Jewish holidays like Yom Kippur, Pesach, Sukkot and Rosh Hashanah, with an exception made for Jewish industrial areas in the territory. The reason given is to prevent terror attacks, and also to enable security personnel at checkpoints time off to enjoy these holidays. Such closures can at times last 11 days. =Marriage difficulties= Coming to terms with the problem of the Palestinian right of return while negotiating for UN recognition in 1948, Israel came up with a family reunification programme, and was granted membership on the understanding that it would comply with international law in this regard. The very word \\"return\\" (awda) was censored from being used in Palestinian newspapers as implying an existential threat to Israel. In practice, Israel evaluates proposed family reunifications in terms of a perceived demographic or security threat. They were frozen in 2002. Families composed of a Jerusalemite spouse and a Palestinian from the West Bank (or Gaza) face enormous legal difficulties in attempts to live together, with most applications, subject to an intricate, on average decade-long, four-stage processing, rejected. Women with \\"foreign husbands\\" (those lacking a Palestinian identity card), are reportedly almost never allowed to rejoin their spouse. The 2003 Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Provision), or CEIL, subsequently renewed in 2016 imposed a ban on family unification between Israeli citizens or \\"permanent residents\\" and their spouses who are originally of the West Bank or Gaza. Such a provision does not apply, however, to Israeli settlers in the West Bank or (until 2005) Gaza. In such instances, the prohibition is explained in terms of \\"security concerns\\". A Jerusalemite Palestinian who joins their spouse in the West Bank and thereby fails to maintain seven years of consecutive residence in East Jerusalem can have their residency right revoked. According to B'Tselem, any of the over 2,000 Palestinians registered as absentee owners of property in the West Bank have been denied permission to re-enter for purposes like family reunifications because their return would compel the Israeli authorities to return their property, on which settlements have been established, to their original Palestinian owners. =Targeted assassinations= Targeted assassinations are acts of lethal selective violence undertaken against specific people identified as threats. Rumours emerged in the press around September 1989 that Israel had drawn up a wanted list, several of whom were subsequently killed, and it was speculated that the time Israel might be operating \\"death squads\\". Israel first publicly acknowledged its use of the tactic against Hussein Abayat at Beit Sahour near Bethlehem in November 2000. In its decision regarding the practice, the Israeli Supreme Court in 2006 refrained from either endorsing or banning the tactic, but set forth four conditions ‚Äì precaution, military necessity, follow-up investigation and proportionality- and stipulated that the legality must be adjudicated on a case-by-case analysis of the circumstances. Nils Melzer found the judgement to be a step forward but flawed in several key regards, particularly for failing to provide guidelines to determine when the practice would be permissible. According to one former official, cited by Daniel Byman, on average Israel spends on average 10 hours planning a targeted killing operation and ten seconds on whether to proceed with the assassination or not. Of the 8,746 violent Palestinian deaths registered from 1987 to 2008, 836 were executed following the identification of individuals based on information gathered from collaborators. According to B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, for the period between 2000 and the end of 2005, 114 civilians died as the result of collateral damage as Israeli security forces successfully targeted 203 Palestinian militants. The figures from 9 November 2000 to 1 June 2007 indicate that Israeli assassinations killed 362 people, 237 being directly targeted and 149 bystanders collaterally. One intelligence officer recounting the atmosphere in the operations room where assassinations were programmed and then witnessed on video, stated that worries about \\"collateral damage\\" never dampened the cheers greeting a successful targeting mission. =Surveillance= Cameras are ubiquitous in the old city, East Jerusalem Cameras are ubiquitous in the old city, East Jerusalem Israel, in its capillary monitoring of Palestinians has been called a Surveillance state par excellence. Among many Israeli critics of the occupaton, the activist Jeff Halper and the philosopher Avishai Margalit express concerns at the paralysing effect on Palestinians of intricate surveillance systems, of a \\"matrix of control\\" underlying the occupation. Soon after hostilities ceased, Israel began to count all items in households from televisions to refrigerators, stoves down to heads of livestock, orchards and tractors. Letters were checked and their addresses registered, and inventories were drawn up of workshops producing furniture, soap, textiles, sweets and even eating habits. While many innovations were introduced to improve workers' productivity, they can also be seen as control mechanisms. Forward military planners in Israel foresee the day when Israel will withdraw from parts of the West Bank: this will not end the Occupation, for thereafter they envisage an \\"invisible occupation\\"/\\"airborne occupation\\" or \\"occupation in disappearance\\" r√©gime, with a continued capacity to control the physically evacuated territory with surveillance and strikes. One former Israeli intelligence officer involved in Unit 8200 likened the surveillance system to that in the German film The Lives of Others, with the difference, in his view, that the Israeli monitoring was more efficient. While the Israeli public thinks, he stated, that this surveillance is focused on combating terrorism, in practice a significant amount of intelligence gathering targets innocent people with no record for militancy. No Palestinian was, he claimed, exempt from non-stop monitoring. Any information enabling \\"extortion\\" or blackmail, such as evidence of marital infidelity, health problems requiring treatment in Israel or sexual orientation is regarded as relevant. Israeli surveillance and strike presence over Palestinian areas is constant and intense, with former Shin Bet head Avi Dichter noting, \\"When a Palestinian child draws a picture of the sky, he doesn't draw it without a helicopter.\\" =Censorship= In the West Bank both the British Mandatory \\"Defense Emergency Regulations of 1945, No. 88\\" ‚Äì stipulating that \\"every article, picture, advertisement, decree and death notice must be submitted to military censors\\", ‚Äì and \\"Israeli Military Order No. IOI (1967)\\", amended by \\"Order No. 718 (1977)\\" and \\"No. 938 (1981)\\" concerning \\"the prohibition of incitement and adverse propaganda\\" formed the basis for censoring West Bank publications, poetry and literary productions. The civil and military censorship bureaus could overturn each other's decisions, making publishing permits increasingly difficult. No clear guidelines however exist, so even works translated from the Hebrew press, or theatrical productions permitted in Israel, such as Hamlet could be censored, Criticism of settlements was disallowed, as were sentiments of national pride. Obituaries mourning the dead, or expressing pride in the fallen ould be challenged. Even mentioning the word \\"Palestine\\" was forbidden. Under Israeli Military Order 101, Palestinians under military law were prohibited from demonstrating and publishing anything relating to a \\"political matter.\\" Newspapers could lose their licenses, without any reason given, on the basis of 1945 Emergency Regulation (Article 92/2). Travel permits to enable notable Palestinians like Elias Freij, Major of Bethlehem, be interviewed abroad could be denied. Graffiti (shi'arati) protesting the occupation were prohibited unless approved by the military, and owners of walls were made responsible and fined for the graffiti, so the practice had to be banned by Palestinians since it became a large source of revenue for Israel. Recently, surveillance of the internet, using software to ostensibly identify in social media posts potential threats led to the arrest of 800 Palestinians both by Israeli units and PA security forces, with 400 detained as \\"lone wolf terrorists\\" for what they wrote, though none had carried out attacks and, according to security expert, Ronen Bergman, no algorithm could identify lone-wolf attackers. =Coercive collaboration= One of the first things Israel captured on conquering the West Bank were the archives of the Jordanian Security Police, whose information allowed them to turn informers in the territory for that service into informers for Israel. Collaborators (asafir), broken in interrogation, and then planted in cells to persuade other prisoners to confess, began to be recruited in 1979. The number of collaborators with Israel before the Oslo Accords was estimated at around 30,000. According to Haaretz, Shin Bet has used a number of \\"dirty\\" techniques to enlist Palestinians on its payroll as informers. These methods include exploiting people who have been identified as suffering from personal and economic hardships, people requesting family reunification, or a permit for medical treatment in Israel. =Taxation= In interrnational law no occupying power has the right to impose taxes in addition to those existing before the occupation Under Military Order 31 of 27 June 1967. Israel took over the Jordanian taxation system, with a notable change: Israelis moving into settlements were exempt, being taxed under Israeli law, while by 1988, the high income tax rate of 55% for people with incomes in the 8,000 dinar bracket was squeezed so that it applied to those earning 5,231 JD. In Israel the 48% tax bracket applied to those who earned almost twice that amount. In 1988 the affluent entrepreneurial Christian town of Beit Sahour, which had several hundred mainly family-run businesses organized a tax boycott on the grounds they saw no benefits flow back from their taxes, and based their boycott on the principle of the American colonial revolt against their British masters, namely No taxation without representation, refusing to pay VAT and/or income taxes. 350 households of 1,000 were targeted and their bank accounts were frozen, while that 500 more had their bank account confiscated or debited Israel reacted with collective punishment, placing the town under a 42-day curfew. Residences were raided every day and business machinery, any equipment for commercial purposes, refrigerators, jewelry, money, household furniture and at times memorabilia, were confiscated. To shield soldiers from stone- throwing, cars were stopped and placed round the houses, while people were mustered to form human shields. The value of the goods confiscated bore no relation to the value of the goods confiscated, and were auctioned off in Israel at an estimated 20% of their replacement value. The effect was to virtually wipe out Beit Sahour's productive base. Agriculture The pastoral economy was a fundamental wing of the Palestinian economy. Of the of grazing land in the West Bank Israel permitted in the first years of the 21st century only for such use. In certain areas, such as the South Hebron Hills, Palestinian bedouin shepherds have their grazing lands disseminated with poison pellets that kill off their flocks, and require minute gleaning and disposal to restore the land to health. In Area C, nearly 500,000 dunams of arable land exist, Palestinian access to which is severely restricted while 137,000 are cultivated or occupied by Israeli settlements. Were the 326,400 dunams theoretically open to Palestinian use made available, the World Bank calculates, it would add $US 1,068 billion to Palestinian productive capacities. Another 1,000,000 dunams could be exploited for grazing or forestry, were Israel to lift its restrictions. The World Bank estimates that were Palestinian agriculture given access to better water resources, they would benefit by a boost in agricultural output of around $1 billion per annum. Israel's control of land, water, trade and markets, and its specification and rigorous restrictions on what could be grown, is held responsible for the decline of agriculture as a share of West Bank GDP, and the drop of agricultural labourers in the work market from 46% to 27%, so that from 1993 to 1995 output declined by 40.12%. In the years directly preceding the Al Aqsa uprising (1998‚Äì1999) the IDF and settlers uprooted 21,705 trees throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. After 1967, restrictions were placed on the types of fruit tree and vegetables that could be planted, and even the importation of tractors required an Israeli permit. A trial study just after the occupation carried out on Deir Dibwan's land, rich in underground water, showed great promise as one of the best sites in the West Bank for growing oranges and bananas. An Israeli drilling permit could not be obtained, leading most of those involved in the project to emigrate to the U.S. Destruction of agricultural goods was considerable during the second intifada. In the five months following its outbreak, 57,928 olive trees, 49,370 citrus trees, 22,270 stone-fruit trees, 11,514 date palms, 12,000 banana trees and 30,282 grapevines were uprooted. Olive oil production dropped 80% that year as a result. In the 15-month period from the outbreak, down to December 2001, the total damage was calculated ast 155,343 olive trees, 150,356 citrus trees, 54, 223 almond trees, 12,505 date palm trees, 39,227 grape vines, 18,400 banana trees, and 49,851 other varieties of tree. From September 2000 to December 2002, Israeli forces destroyed 14,196 forest trees. In the first two years, taking in the damage wrought by Israel in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, according to Cheryl Rubenberg, 667,000 trees were extirpated and 3,669,000 square metres of agricultural land destroyed. The restrictive allocation of water to Palestinian agriculture has remained constant, at 84 million cubic metres per annum, since 1967, according to Palestinian authorities. The Oslo Accords foresaw a supplementary 70‚Äì80 million cubic metres to be supplied, but in two decades only about half of this additional supply had been provided. The olive tree, aside from its economic function, is a symbol of Palestinian nationhood, of their quest for independence, much as the pine introduced by Zionist arboriculture. 15% of the territories ‚Äì 45% of its arable land ‚Äì is covered by olive groves, and is both a key resource, and its bimonthly autumnal harvesting a period of deep socioeconomic importance for families in most villages in the West Bank, for whom it provides roughly 40% (2009) of West Bank agricultural output. It has mopped up unemployment caused by job loss in Israel after the outbreak of the Second Intifada and is called colloquially shajara el-fakir (pauper's tree), and regarded as holy (shajara mubaraka). Their uprooting by state agencies or settlers is an everyday occurrence in the West Bank. Israeli officials see olive grove cultivation as \\"one of the best ownership techniques around\\". One Israeli official likened Palestinian olive trees to Palestinian children. They look na√Øve but several years down the track they turn into ticking bombs. The centrality of such olive groves for Palestinians is, according to Michael Sfard, viewed in the Zionist narrative as emblematic of \\"Arab laziness\\", since it grows alone and can be shaken down once a year to yield its wealth. In one analysis in 2006 it emerged that only 4% of complaints against settler trespass and destruction of Palestinian olive trees ever led to prosecution. Following an Ottoman practice of uprooting olive trees to punish tax evasion, Israel began destroying groves, but with the expressed purpose of increasing security for settlements, and visibility for its internal West Bank road system servicing the colonial infrastructure. Construction of the Separation Barrier, erected predominantly on West Bank land, led to the uprooting of tens of thousands of olive trees. In just one village, Qafeen, the wall's route led to the uprooting of 12,000 trees of this variety, while alienating the inhabitants from their groves with a further 100,000 trees left on the Israeli side in a seam-zone, which they may access only once a year. Aside from state practices, settlers have waged what one scholar terms \\"tree warfare\\" consisting in the stealing, uprooting, chopping or burning of native Palestinian olive groves, often as part of price tag operations. Of the 708,000 dunums of irrigable land in the West Bank only 247,000 dunums under aggregate irrigation, and it has been calculated (2009) the gross margin Palestinians forego touches close to $480 million per annum, roughly about 10% of GDP. The collateral effect of loss for potential employment runs close to (upper estimate) 10,000 jobs. The World Bank has observed that only 35 per cent of irrigable Palestinian land is actually irrigated, which costs the economy 110,000 jobs and 10 per cent of GDP. =Water= In the wake of 1967, Israel abrogated Palestinian water rights in the West Bank, and with Military Order 92 of August of that year invested all power over water management to the military authority, As of 1996, no Palestinian had received a permit to drill a well since that date, by which time Israel drew a third of its fresh water and 50% of its drinking water, from the West Bank. According to Human Rights Watch Israel's confiscation of water violates the Hague Regulations of 1907, which prohibit an occupying power from expropriating the resources of occupied territory for its own benefit. Palestinians have complained that their economy and agriculture are badly affected by the depletion of village waters in favour of supplying settlements. Israel placed restrictive policies on West Bank users. Differentials in costs of supply to Palestinians and settlements, which consumed 8 to 10 times what Palestinians were allowed, was blatant: settlements paid 0.5 New Israeli shekels (NIS), while Palestinian villages paid 1.8 NIS, per m3, with the former supplied daily, while delivery to the latter was limited to one or two days a week. Much of dispute re \\"blatant discrimination\\" in water pricing, allocation and delivery systems. Water consumption by Israeli settlers in the Territories is roughly eight to ten times that of Palestinians. Water is sold to Israeli settlements for 0.5 New Israeli shekels (NIS) per m3, while it was sold to Palestinian villages for 1.8 NIS per m3. According to John Cooley, West Bank Palestinian farmers' wells were a key element behind Israel's post-1967 strategy to keep the area and in order to protect \\"Jewish water supplies\\" from what was considered \\"encroachment\\" By 2013, though some villages had only 15 litres per person, it was estimated West Bank Palestinians were supplied an average per capita 70 litres per day, as opposed to the 280‚Äì300 litres per person for Jewish settlers. Sometimes the contrast is starker: Al-Hadidiya's 20 litres per person versus the 431 litres per day consumed on the neighbouring Jewish moshav settlement of Ro'i, which draws 431 litres per person per day from a well it drilled on Al-Hadidiya land. Israeli settlements have also pursued a practice of taking over for their own uses numerous springs belonging to Palestinian villages, appropriating them to create adjoining parks suitable to tourism. Palestinians are denied access. =Waste zone= Israel ratified the international Basel Convention treaty on Israel on 14 December 1994, according to which, any transfer of waste must be performed with an awareness of the dangers posed to the disempowered occupied people. It forbids the creation among them of \\"environmental sacrifice zones.\\" Israel, it is argued, uses the West Bank as a \\"sacrifice\\" zone for placing 15 waste treatment plants, which are there under less stringent rules that those required in Israel because a different legal system has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment. The military authorities do not render public the details of these operations. These materials consist of such things as sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries. Within Israel strict environment laws apply. Of 121 settlements studied in 2007, 81 had wastewater facilities, many subject to breakdown, with sewage flowing into streams affecting Palestinian villages nearby. Few pollution indictments result in action. Israel built 4 plants for Palestinian waste in the 1970s: only one was functioning (2007), and Israeli budgetary problems were cited for the lack of adequate infrastructure that left most Palestinian sewage untreated. The landfill near Al-Jiftlik in the Jericho Governorate, built on absentee Palestinian property without planning or an environment impact analysis, is for the exclusive use of waste, 1,000 tons per day, produced by Israeli settlements and cities within Israel. Palestinians are restricted to 3 landfills, and permits for more have been denied unless the sites can be used to dump settlement garbage. Even if a permit is given without this agreement, settler waste under military escort is still dumped there. =Loss of cultural property= The Israeli Antiquities Law of 1978 foresaw expropriations of any site necessary for preservation, excavation or research. The military administration can confiscate Palestinian land on or near such sites, deny their owners' building permits while at times, such areas are open to Israeli settlement. Under the Hague Convention of 1954 an occupying power may not remove material from the occupied country. In 2019 the Israeli High Court ruled that Israeli archaeological work in the West Bank may be kept off the public record. In 2019 alone, Israel order 119 demolition orders and warnings to desist from 'destroying antiquities' in the West Bank, a rise of 162% over preceding years. Regavim's Shomrim Al Hanetzach (\\"guarding eternity\\") lobbies for such orders against what they call a \\"quiet Isis\\", though many affected families and villagers are unaware of any archaeological material on their land, and these zones net in areas far larger than the actual known archaeological remains at their centre. Albert Glock, among others, argued that the thrust of archaeology has been to interpret the Palestinian past in Christian and Jewish Zionist terms, in the latter instance, providing a charter for the occupation, to the detriment of the Palestinian cultural heritage. Many sites with dual cultural value have been wrested from Palestinian control, such as the Herodium, Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Rachel's Tomb the Tomb of Jesse and Ruth in Tel Rumeida, Hebron and at Qumran near the Palestinian villager of Shuqba is a garbage dump for settlement waste. Many Palestinian heritage sites within the West Bank have been added to the Jewish heritage list. Aside from the destruction of villages, in Jerusalem and elsewhere, significant losses were incurred by the expropriation of libraries with extensive historical resources regarding Palestine's Arabic past. =Tourism= The West Bank is a key attraction for pilgrims and tourists and has a rich heritage of deep significance for members of the Abrahamic religions. After 1967 the loss of East Jerusalem cut off potential gains to the West Bank economy from tourism. From 92 to 94 cents in every dollar of the tourist trade goes to Israel, which exercises a virtual monopoly. Israel controls all access points to the major tourist attractions in East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jericho, and Palestinian hotels in most West Bank areas remain half-empty. Israeli obstacles make Palestinian recreational access to, or development of tourist infrastructure around, the Dead Sea difficult. The World Bank estimates that $126 million annually and 2,900 jobs would accrue to the local economy if Palestinians were allowed to operate on similar terms available to Israel entrepreneurs. Palestinians have been blocked at checkpoints from beaches there putatively because their presence would harm Israeli tourist businesses. =Resource extraction= According to the Hague Conventions (Article 55 an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets: the usufruct must benefit the people under occupation. The Oslo Accords agreed to the transfer of mining rights to the Palestinian Authority. Israel has given concessions for 11 settlement quarries to operate. The World Bank estimates that 275 quarries could be opened in Area C, and that Israeli restrictions cost the Palestinian economy US$241 million per year. Palestinians are also denied permits to process Dead Sea minerals, such as bromine, about 75% of world production of which comes from this area, while Israeli firms such as Ahava do so and export to the EU. The latter restrictions are estimated to cost the Palestinian economy $642 million. Economic and social benefits and costs of the occupation Many Israeli businesses operate in the West Bank, often run by settlers who enjoy the benefits of government subsidies, low rents, favourable tax rates and access to cheap Palestinian labour. Human Rights Watch claims that the \\"physical imprint\\", with 20 Israeli industrial zones covering by 2016 some 1,365 hectares, of such commercial operations, agricultural and otherwise, is more extensive than that of the settlements themselves. The restrictions on Palestinian enterprise in Area C cause unemployment which is then mopped up by industrial parks that can draw on a pool of people without job prospects if not in settlements. Some Palestinian workers at the Barkan Industrial Park have complained anonymously that they were paid less than the minimum Israeli wage per hour ($5.75), with payments ranging from $1.50 to 2-4 dollars, with shifts of up to 12 hours, no vacations, sick days, pay slips or social benefits. Many such businesses export abroad, making the world complicit in the settlement project. Israeli policy aimed to impede any form of Palestinian competition with Israeli economic interests. The approach was set forth by Israel's then Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1986, who stated: > \\"there will be no development initiated by the Israeli Government, and no > permits will be given for expanding agriculture or industry, which may > compete with the State of Israel\\". The World Bank estimated that the annual economic costs to the Palestinian economy of the Israeli occupation of Area C alone in 2015 was 23% of GNP in direct costs, and 12% in indirect costs, totally 35% which, together with fiscal loss of revenue at 800 million dollars, totals an estimated 5.2 billion dollars. Fiscally, one estimate places the \\"leakage\\" of Palestinian revenue back to the Israeli treasury at 17% of total Palestinian public revenue, 3.6% of GNP. A 2015 estimate put annual Israeli government expenditure on settlements at $US1.1 billion, though this is an inference given that the government does not report its expenditures on settlements. By 1982 subsidized Israeli agricultural productions and unhampered flow of Israeli manufactures hindered the growth of manufacturing industries in the Palestinian territories. High tariffs imposed by Israel on imports from countries outside the area of Israel meant Palestinian consumers had a choice of paying high prices for imported goods from foreign countries, or purchasing them from high-cost Israeli suppliers. Palestinian goods exporting to Israel were hit by tariffs, which down to 1991 earned Israel annually $1,000,000, but Israeli exports to the Palestinian territories were exempted from import duties. Since internal economic growth is hampered by Israeli restrictions, and, to compensate, 40% of the Palestinian economy relies on international aid, it is argued that such aid constitutes a subsidy to the occupation itself, making it \\"one of the cheapest occupations\\", for Israel. The Paris Protocol undersigned in 1994 allowed Israel to collect VAT on all Palestinian imports and good from that country or in transit through its ports, with the system of clearance revenue giving it effective control over roughly 75% of PA income. Israel can withhold that revenue as a punitive measure, as it did in response to the decision by the PA to adhere to the International Criminal Court in 2015. A 2009 World Bank study concluded that \\"Very few economies have faced such a comprehensive array of obstacles to investment -- not just of physical impediments to movement, but also comprehensive institutional and administrative barriers to economies of scale and natural resources, along with an unclear political horizon and the inability to predictably plan movement of people and goods\\". =Communications= Under the Oslo Accords, Israel agreed that the Palestinian territories had a right to construct and operate an independent communications network. In 2016 a World Bank analysis concluded the provisions of this agreement had not been applied, causing notable detrimental effects to Palestinian development. It took 8 years for Israel to agree to a request for frequencies for 3G services, though they were limited, causing a bottleneck which left Israeli competitors with a distinct market advantage. The local Wataniya mobile operator's competitiveness suffered from Israeli restrictions and delays, and illegal Israeli operators in the West Bank, with 4G services available by that date, still maintained an unfair advantage over Palestinian companies. Israel imposes three other constraints that hamper Palestinian competitiveness: restrictions are imposed on imports of equipment for telecom and ICT companies, and movement to improve the development and maintenance of infrastructure in Area C, and finally, Palestinian telecommunications accessing international links must go through companies with Israeli registration. From 2008 to 2016, they concluded, progress in negotiating resolutions to these problems had been \\"very slim\\". =Overall economic costs= A joint study by the Palestinian Ministry of National Economy and researchers at the Applied Research Institute‚ÄìJerusalem argued that by 2010 the costs of occupation amounted in 2010 alone rose to 84.9% of the total Palestinian GDP ($US 6.897 billion). Their estimate for 2014 states that the total economic cost of Israel's occupation amounted to 74.27% of Palestinian nominal GDP, or some $(US) 9.46 billion. The cost to Israel's economy by 2007 was estimated at $50 billion. =Indirect costs to Israel= The indirect cost to the Israeli economy for defense outlays and maintaining operations in the territories has also been substantial. One analysis has concluded that the costs of maintaining Israel's occupation is a contributing factor to the rise of poverty in Israel, where poverty levels have jumped from one in ten families in the 1970s, compared to one in five at present. The high costs of subsidizing the settlement project shifted investment from Israel's development towns on its periphery and led to cutbacks in sectors like health care, education and welfare. The settlement surge under Begin's Likud government was detrimental to housing development for Israelis in Israel: 44% of the entire budget of the Ministry of Housing and Construction in 1982 went to West Bank settlements. The substitution of imported foreign labour for Palestinians has also arguably lowered the bargaining power of Israeli blue-collar workers. In the aftermath of the Second Intifada, the budgetary allocations for Israel's social security net were reduced drastically: between 2001 and 2005 as defense outlays ratcheted up, child allowances were cut by 45%, unemployment compensation by 47%, and income maintenance by 25%. The annual growth, NIS 4.6 billion, in the defence budget for the decade 2007 onwards recommended by the Brodet Commission was close to Israel's total annual expenditure on higher education. Defense specialists also claim that guarding settlers lowers the combat readiness of soldiers, since they have far less time to train. It is also argued that the logic of settlements undermines Israel's rule of law. =Cultural impact= Many studies, following the work of Daniel Bar-Tal and Gavriel Salomon, have analyzed the emergence and consolidation of an \\"ethos of conflict\\", one of what they see as three key components of Israeli Jewish society ‚Äì the others being collective memory of the conflict and collective emotional orientations ‚Äì which have developed to cope with the stress of an intractable conflict. This complex can be broken down into eight societal values informing a unilateral outlook: (a) The justice of Israel's cause; (b) Security (including national survival) (c) Positive collective ethnocentric in-group images; (d) One's Own Victimization; (e) Delegitimizing the adversary by denying their humanity, allowing one to harm them; (f) Patriotism; (g) Beliefs reinforcing social solidarity, by ignoring internal disagreements; (h) Belief that peace is the goal. Recent research suggests that four of these ‚Äì the persistence of a sense of historic trauma and an ethos of conflict (delegitimization of the opponent, security, own victimization and justness of one's own goals) ‚Äì consistently influence decision-making on the conflict in the Israeli Supreme Court itself. The same model has been applied to Palestinian society, emphasizing that of all themes patriotism in the form of m≈´qƒÅwama (resistance and readiness for self-sacrifice) form the keynote of Palestinian identity. Wider implications A concern for security in Israel has been said to \\"vastly exceed the norm for other Western countries\\". Israel's military- industrial sector, which by the early 1980s employed a quarter of all industrial workers with 28% of GNP devoted to defense expenditures, became the fastest growing sector of the economy after 1967. In 1981, Ya'akov Meridor stated Israel aspired to play the role of \\"top proxy\\" for the United States in Central America. By 1984, according to Jan Nederveen Pieterse, Israel had become one of the world's major arms exporters, the largest arms supplier to Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, and globally active in the business of counterinsurgency, expertise in which was gained in enforcing land expropriations and settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Galilee. Knowledge of this background, he argued, was useful for assessing Israel's \\"export\\" of its methods, to countries like Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sri Lanka, in some of which existed similar configurations of policy involving land, domination and exploitation, population policy, and terror. One settlement project in Costa Rica for example is thought to be based on Israeli expertise honed in West Bank projects. The Israeli techniques of urban warfare against Palestinians in their towns and villages territories has influenced many other military powers. Many argue that Israeli methods developed in their conflict with Palestinians have been a significant influence on U.S. military doctrines developed under the administration of George W. Bush. The American claim that new methods developed for the war on terror were necessary since the situation was unprecedented and therefore was a legal no man's land had a precedent in Israeli claims the war on terror in the West Bank was a legal terra nulla, and thus allowed approaches like extrajudicial and preemptive assassination, a terminology already used by Israel with regard to its approach to resistance in the West Bank and Gaza. The high-tech security and urban warfare systems, and the surveillance devices developed while securing the occupation particularly during the Al-Aqsa Intifada, have turned Israel into one of the major exporters of such systems in the world. Israel has become a pioneering leader in the manufacture of drones, border surveillance sensors, with the commercial advantage of having these devices \\"battle-tested\\" in the \\"laboratories\\" of the occupied territory. Jeff Halper has spoken of the risk of 'Palestinizing' the American people as, Israel has deepened its training programs for American police forces. Hoover Institution Fellow and Senior Fellow at the Joint Special Operations University Thomas H. Henriksen writes that:- > The Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) military actions have been ‚Äì and are ‚Äì a > crucible for methods, procedures, tactics, and techniques for the United > States, which faces a similarly fanatical foe across the world in the Global > War on Terror...

In 2018, she won one minor race in her first four starts but then made rapid improvement to win the Silver Flash Stakes, Debutante Stakes and Moyglare Stud Stakes. At the end of the season she was named Cartier Champion Two-year-old Filly. Background Skitter Scatter is a bay mare with a small white star bred in Kentucky by Three Chimneys Farm and the Irish-based Airlie Stud. After being withdrawn from the Keeneland yearling sale in September 2017, she was sent to Ireland and entered training with Patrick \\"P. J.\\" Prendergast at Melitta Lodge, County Kildare. In 2018 she raced in the colours of the mother and son team of Sonia Rogers and Anthony Rogers of the Airlie Stud and was ridden in all of her races by Ronan Whelan. She was sired by Scat Daddy, who won the Champagne Stakes in 2006 and the Florida Derby in 2007 before his racing career was ended by injury. Scat Daddy's other offspring include Justify, No Nay Never, Daddy Long Legs and Lady Aurelia. Skitter Scatter's dam Dane Street (a half-sister to Intense Focus) was an American-bred mare who raced in Ireland and showed modest racing ability, winning two minor races from eleven starts. As a descendant of the British broodmare Fanghorn she was also related to Soldier of Fortune, Double Form and Gran Criterium winner Sholokhov. Racing career=2018: two-year- old season= Skitter Scatter began her racing career in a five furlong maiden race on the Polytrack surface at Dundalk Racecourse on 28 March and finished third of seven runners, beaten a neck and one and a half lengths by Jungle Jane and Romme. Two weeks later she started at odds of 5/1 for a maiden over the same course and distance and recorded her first success, defeating the Aidan O'Brien-trained colt Sergei Prokofiev by a short head. The runner-up went on to win the Rochestown Stakes and the Cornwallis Stakes. On 20 May the filly was stepped up in class and distance for the Listed Fillies' Sprint Stakes over six furlongs at Naas Racecourse. Starting at 8/1 she led in the early stages before being overtaken in the last quarter mile and came home third behind Servalan and Chicas Amigas, just ahead of the odds-on favourite So Perfect. On 1 July Skitter Scatter started a 16/1 outsider for the Group 3 Grangecon Stud Stakes at the Curragh Racecourse and after disputing the lead for most of the way she was overhauled in the final strides and beaten half a length by So Perfect. At Leopardstown Racecourse at the end of the month the filly was moved up in distance for the Silver Flash Stakes over seven furlongs at started at odds of 10/1 in a six-runner field headed by the O'Brien trained Goddess. After being up with the leaders from the start, she went to the front two furlongs out, established a clear lead, and stayed on to win by one and a half lengths from Moravia. Ronan Whelan commented \\"She got a beautiful run throughout and I wasn‚Äôt concerned about the step up in trip, as she's more relentless than a quickener and I didn‚Äôt want to give her too much to do. I got to the front too soon, but she's tough and I knew they‚Äôd have to work to get to me.\\" On 26 August Skitter Scatter was moved up to Group 2 class for the seven-furlong Debutante Stakes at the Curragh. Zagitova started favourite ahead of Lady Kaya and Viadera (runner-up in the Anglesey Stakes) with Skitter Scatter the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting alongside Hermosa. After tracking the leaders Skitter Scatter gained the advantage in the last quarter mile and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a quarter lengths from the 50/1 outsider Bandiuc Eile. The subsequent Fillies' Mile winner Iridessa came home three lengths further back in fifth place. The Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 16 September saw Skitter Scatter start the 7/2 favourite against nine opponents. Bandiuc Eile, Zagitova, Hermosa and Lady Kaya were again in opposition while the others included Just Wonderful (Flame of Tara Stakes) and the British challengers Beyond Reason (Chesham Stakes, Prix du Calvados) and Main Edition (Albany Stakes, Sweet Solera Stakes). She was restrained by Whelan in the early stages before beginning to make progress in the last quarter mile. She took the lead inside the final furlong and pulled ahead to win by two lengths from Lady Kaya. After the race Patrick Prerdergast said \\"Coming here I thought this was a filly who could run well in a Guineas, now I think she could win it. I'm quite astounded at how good she is. I was worried coming into today because I'd felt it had been a long year for her. We just wanted to win her maiden, that was my brief and it's incredible that she has just kept going and improving. I was also worried that she has finally started to grow ‚Äì she's not going to be so small next year.\\" At the 2018 Cartier Awards, Skitter Scatter was named Champion Two-year-old Filly. =2019: three-year-old season= For the 2019 season Skitter Scatter was moved to the stable of John Oxx although Whelan remained her regular jockey. On her three-year-old debut the filly started at odds of 7/1 in fifteen-runner field for the 206th running of the 1000 Guineas on 5 May at Newmarket Racecourse but made little impact and finished towards the rear in a race won by Hermosa. After a lengthy break Skitter Scatter returned on 29 August and started 5/2 favourite for the Group 3 Fairy Bridge Stakes over seven and a half furlongs at Tipperary Racecourse. She took the lead inside the final furlong but was run down by the four-year-old Waitingfortheday and beaten half a length into second place. At Leopardstown on 14 September the filly started at odds of 14/1 for the Matron Stakes and came home a distant last of the seven runners.

A digital version of the game was released for the PlayStation Store in 2014 under the PSone Classics brand. Gameplay PlayStation version screenshot, showing the player walking around the Pac-Man exhibit. Namco Museum Vol. 1 is a compilation of seven Namco-developed arcade games from the 1980s ‚Äî Pac-Man (1980), Rally-X (1980), New Rally-X (1981), Galaga (1981), Bosconian (1981), Pole Position (1982) and Toy Pop (1986). Players can modify in-game settings, such as the starting number of lives, and can also enable the game's original boot-up sequence. Pole Position supports the Namco NeGcon for analog to compensate for the lack of an analog controller at the time, while Galaga and Pac-Man allow support for vertical monitors. The collection uses a 3D virtual museum that the player can walk around and interact with, as opposed to a menu system like other similar compilations.

They are New Hampshire's first hurling club consisting solely of American-born players, as opposed to clubs formed with Irish or other expatriates. The club competes at the Jr. C & Jr. B levels. History In 2005, a troop transport with National Guard soldiers coming from Iraq stopped in Shannon to refuel. The players saw hurling being played on the television screen at the airport bar, and were inspired to start their own team. The Wolves were the subject of a 2011 Pentagon Channel documentary Two Fields One Team, broadcast to U.S. military networks around the world. In 2017, the Wolves were featured on WMUR-TV's NH Chronicle segment. Overview The club aims to develop American players who are new to the sport. The club maintains a youth program and also supports the Camogie community, and is funded by the players and sponsors. While the traveling Wolves Hurling Club plays games among the six teams within the Boston GAA, there are coed club teams which compete in weekly local matches. The traveling team is made up of players who also play on the coed club teams. In 2011, the New Hampshire Wolves Hurling Club team captured its first Northeast Junior C Championship.

Organized by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, it was attended by delegations from 38 countries, including Russia, the United States, Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey, as well as representatives of many rival Libyan factions fighting for power in the country. Attendants included Libyan prime minister Fayez al-Sarraj, Libyan field marshal Khalifa Haftar, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Tunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi, Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Libyan parliamentary speaker Aguila Saleh, and Khalid al-Mishri speaker of the upper chamber in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Turkey's delegation, headed by Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay, withdrew from the conference on 13 November as a result of the exclusion of Turkish officials, on Haftar's insistence, from a private meeting between the conflict's key players. While the conference led to no significant breakthroughs, it marked the first occasion on which Italy legitimized Haftar as a party in Libyan peace negotiations since the 2016 conclusion of the agreements that led to the establishment of the Government of National Accord. Haftar, who had made a surprise visit to Moscow earlier that month, was initially reluctant to attend the Palermo talks. He was likely convinced by Egypt and Russia to take part in the event. Italian lawmaker Marco Zanni praised the conference. He was quoted as saying \\"The conference for Libya in Palermo has been a fundamental step in order to stabilize Libya and for the security of the entire Mediterranean\\". adding that the event constituted Italy's attempt to take a leading role in the Libyan peace process.

Notable strips that originated with the World included Richard F. Outcault's Hogan's Alley, Rudolph Dirks' The Captain and the Kids, Denys Wortman's Everyday Movies, Fritzi Ritz, Gus Mager's Hawkshaw the Detective, Victor Forsythe's Joe Jinks, and Robert Moore Brinkerhoff's Little Mary Mixup. Under the names World Feature Service and New York World Press Publishing the company also syndicated comic strips to other newspapers around the country from circa 1905 until the paper's demise in 1931.  History  Joseph Pulitzer's New York World newspaper began publishing cartoons in 1889. A color Sunday humor supplement began to run in the World in Spring 1893. In 1894, the World published the first color strip, designed by Walt McDougall, showing that the technique already enabled this kind of publication. The supplement's editor Morrill Goddard contacted cartoonist Richard F. Outcault and offered Outcault a full-time position with the World. Outcault's Yellow Kid character made his debut in the World on January 13, 1895. The kid appeared in color for the first time in the May 5 issue in a cartoon titled \\"At the Circus in Hogan's Alley\\". Outcault weekly Hogan's Alley cartoons appeared from then on in color, starring rambunctious slum kids in the streets, in particular, the bald kid, who gained the name Mickey Dugan. The strip's popularity drove up the Worlds circulation and the Kid was widely merchandised. Outcault ‚Äî and much of the World's Sunday supplement staff ‚Äî left for William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal on October 18, 1896. George Luks took over with his own version of Hogan's Alley; but the Yellow Kid's popularity soon faded, and Luks' version ended in December 1897. After Hogan's Alley, the World published a number of comic strips from the late 1890s until the paper's 1931 demise. The prolific cartoonist C. W. Kahles was responsible for numerous comic strips for the World. He is credited as the pioneer of daily comic strip continuity with his Clarence the Cop, which he drew for the World beginning in the latter 1890s. It introduced to newspapers the innovation of continuing a comic strip story in a day-to-day serial format, and is also considered to be the first police strip. Kahles' Sandy Highflyer, the Airship Man (1902‚Äì1904) is considered the first aviation comic strip. The cartoonist and comics historian Ernest McGee called Kahles the \\"hardest working cartoonist in history, having as many as eight Sunday comics running at one time (1905-1906) with no assistants to help him.\\" Clare Victor Dwiggins joined the World in 1897. He created a wide variety of gag panels. In 1904, after winning $3,000 at the racetrack, cartoonist George McManus went to New York City and a job with the World, where he worked on several short-lived comic strips. One of them, The Newlyweds (later renamed Their Only Child) is considered one of the first comic strips to depict the lives of the typical American family.Markstein, Don. \\"The Newlyweds,\\" '\\"Toonpedia. Accessed Nov. 16, 2018. Gene Carr and Milt Gross were also notable for the number of their comic strips published and distributed by the World. Beginning in about 1905, the company began syndicating strips to other newspapers under the name World Feature Service; in circa 1910 it added the syndication division New York World Press Publishing (also known as Press Publishing Co.).Hudson, Frederic, Alfred McClung Lee, and Frank Luther Mott. American Journalism 1690-1940, Volume 4 (Psychology Press, 2000), p. 591. Many notable cartoonists were on staff at various times at the paper, including Charles W. Saalburg, V. Floyd Campbell, Richard F. Outcault, Walt McDougall, George Herriman, Harry Grant Dart, J. Campbell Cory, George Luks, Clare Victor Dwiggins, C. W. Kahles, Carl Thomas Anderson, Charles A. Voight, Jack Callahan, Frank Fogarty, Walter Berndt, George McManus, Leslie Turner, Harry Haenigsen, and Percy Crosby. In the early 1900s the World was known as \\"the promised land for aspiring cartoonists.\\" Charles Saalburg was chief of the color department during the heyday of the Yellow Kid. Harry Grant Dart eventually rose to become the World's art editor, followed by Al Smith, who was the art editor for the syndication department from 1920 to 1930. After a series of legal battles between 1912 and 1914, Rudolph Dirks, creator of the hugely popular The Katzenjammer Kids strip, left the Hearst organization for Pulitzer and began a new strip, first titled Hans and Fritz and then The Captain and the Kids. It featured the same characters seen in The Katzenjammer Kids, and remained nearly as popular (eventually running until 1979). The E. W. Scripps Company acquired the New York World newspaper and its syndication assets in February 1931, bringing over to Scripps' United Feature Syndicate the popular comic strips The Captain and the Kids, Everyday Movies, Fritzi Ritz, Hawkshaw the Detective, Joe Jinks, and Little Mary Mixup.Booker, M.

Specifics aside, Osh's viral remix helped touch off much discussion of how such releases can influence the originals' popularity as they gain their own, and related questions around influence and originality. The track led to a live appearance singing on the London Eye for BBC Radio 1Xtra. Osh signed with Columbia Records in November 2018 and the single was released on 16 November.

Crespi (1916-2008) was an American psychologist who directed public opinion research for the U.S. Information Agency. Crespi graduated from UCLA in 1937, and earned a Ph.D. from Princeton in 1942 in the field of comparative psychology. During his time as a graduate student, he discovered what has come to be known as the Crespi Effect: when the attractiveness of a reward is suddenly changed, this can temporarily influence performance more than one would expect from the size of the change in the reward. After his graduation, Dr. Crespi taught on the faculty at Princeton. During this time he became involved in public opinion research. One early survey, \\"The Implications of Tipping in America,\\" examined the psychology of tipping behavior, finding that most people tip out of a sense of social obligation and would rather see the practice abolished. He also contributed a chapter supporting the methodology behind Alfred C. Kinsey's sexual behavior studies to the book \\"Sex Habits of American Men\\" in 1948. Crespi left Princeton to work for the United States government, surveying European public opinion in postwar Germany. He returned to Washington in 1954 to head a worldwide program of opinion surveys for the newly-formed United States Information Agency, where he would work for 32 years. In 1962, Crespi received a Superior Service Award from USIA Director Edward R. Murrow for ‚Äúmaking a unique and original contribution to the conduct of United States foreign information activities by his pioneering use of surveys.‚Äù From 1955-1956 he also served as President of the World Association of Public Opinion Research.

John F. Kennedy had been arguing that US prestige was declining abroad, and the leaked survey supported Kennedy's arguments.

History  InterRent was founded in 2006, and listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2007. The company experienced significant growth between 2009 and 2017, doubling its portfolio. In 2013, it purchased 3 buildings worth $35 million in Montreal. Two years later, in 2015, the company announced it had appointed Brad Cutsey as its president. In 2017, InterRent bought a one-third share in Trinity Station, a proposed development near Ottawa's Bayview Station, for $14.2 million. Also in 2017, InterRent purchased two buildings in Montreal at 2121 and 2255 Saint Mathieu St. for a total of $53.75 million. At the same time, the company purchased an apartment building at 3 East 37th St. in Hamilton for $11.25 million. In February 2018, InterRent announced it would internalize its property management functions. Its previous property manager was the CLV Group, whose president, Mike McGahan, is also CEO of InterRent. InterRent paid roughly $38 million to CLV Group in the deal, which also eliminates potential conflict of interest. In 2015, InterRent purchased Stoney Creek Towers, an east-end Hamilton apartment complex containing 518 units, for $51 million. The company planned to make significant improvements to the poorly managed buildings to improve building functions and safety. In May 2018, the company applied for an Above Guideline Rent Increase, due to the improvements that had taken place. As a result, 80 to 100 tenants in the complex went on a rent strike, organized by the Hamilton Tenant Solidarity Network. The tenants claimed that the improvements made had been minor and cosmetic; the company said that it had spent $17 million on repairs and upgrades. In August 2018, a few dozen tenants traveled to Ottawa to protest at the company's Ottawa headquarters, and at the home of the company's CEO, Mike McGahan. However, they failed to secure a formal meeting with Mr. McGahan or other company representatives.  Properties  InterRent primarily owns apartment complexes in medium-sized centres in Ontario and Quebec. Cities where it has a significant number of properties include Ottawa, Gatineau, Hamilton, Toronto and area, and Montreal. The company's general strategy is to invest in poorly managed properties, make significant upgrades, and improve the quality of the apartments and amenities for new and existing residents.

Amaral was born the son of slaves from the Congo and Mozambique. When he was 17 years old, he benefitted from Princess Isabel's Lei √Åurea law, which was soon to be emancipated. Soon after, without much options for work, he ended up joining the army and served in several Brazilian cities, even fighting in the War of Canudos. He disappeared several times from the battalions he served, be it in the army or police guard, and finally he was arrested, spending a few months in jail. In the year 1926, when he was 55 years old and living life as a wanderer surviving on odd jobs, he committed his first alleged crime. He was accused of strangling and sodomizing a 27-year-old man, the body being later found in the vicinity of the Campo de Marte Airport. After that, he allegedly committed two more attacks of the same nature, while also having sex with his victims' still warm bodies. Amaral had also attempted to swindle and violently attack another young man, but the victim had managed to escape because the \\"Black\\" became frightened and fled, allowing him to report the accident to the police. Soon after he was arrested, Amaral was tortured by police and eventually confessed to the murders. Already famous in S√£o Paulo before his arrest, the newspapers of the time told about a serial killer in the city, with the local media using the nicknames \\"The Black Monster\\" and \\"The Black Devil\\". Amaral was examined by a psychiatrist while imprisoned, and during one of the consultations, he told the examiner about the exaggerated size of his penis, claiming that he had always had difficulties relating to women because, according to him, none of them wanted to have sex due to the size of his limb. He also said that he had gone through a macumba as a boy, and that after the ritual his penis did not stop growing. At the time this ended up relating the size of his penis to the size of his bestiality (a common thought of the population about black people at the time). Murders continued to happen, even with Preto Amaral imprisoned, and with this he turned out to be a legend. The angry population demanded he be lynched for this crimes, but Amaral died from tuberculosis before his trial, five months after his 1927 arrest. Although he has never been tried, he is considered the first Brazilian serial killer, and today his story is part of S√£o Paulo's crime museum. There even was a theatrical production titled The Crimes of Preto Amaral, which told the story of the supposed serial killer. 85 years after being accused of the crimes that shocked the city of S√£o Paulo, a simulated jury was held in the Noble Hall of the Law School, University of S√£o Paulo, where Preto Amaral was acquitted post-mortem by 257 votes to 57 for his conviction.Image Gallery - Preto Amaral: the first Brazilian serial killer, accessed on February 17, 2016  References  Bibliography  * Ilana Casoy's Serial Killers Made in Brazil (the book tells the story of those who are considered Brazilian serial killers, and it includes Preto Amaral) 1871 births 1927 deaths Brazilian serial killers Male serial killers 20th-century deaths from tuberculosis Brazilian people of Democratic Republic of the Congo descent Brazilian people of Mozambican descent Tuberculosis deaths in Brazil ","title":"Jos√© Augusto do Amaral"},{"id":"59077250","text":"The Croeseid, anciently Kroiseioi stateres, was a type of coin, either in gold or silver, which was minted in Sardis by the king of Lydia Croesus (561‚Äì546 BCE) from around 550 BCE. Croesus is credited with issuing the first true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation, and the world's first bimetallic monetary system. Precedents Before the Croesus, his father Alyattes had already started to mint various types of non-standardized coins. They were made in a natural occurring material called electrum, a variable mix of gold and silver (with about 54% gold and 44% silver), and were in use in Lydia and surrounding areas for about 80 years. The unpredictability of its composition implied that it had a variable value, which greatly hampered its development. The royal symbol stamped on the coin, similar to a seal, was a declaration of the value of the contents. Herodotus mentioned the innovation made by the Lydians: Coin of Alyattes in electrum, 620-563 BCE. Legend Walwel (\\"Alyattes\\") in Lydian script. Characteristics Croesus replaced all the electrum coins by gold and silver coins using a single coin type: the facing foreparts of a lion and a bull. Compared to later copies made by the Achaemenids, the original Croeseid use a more natural rendering of the two animals. The reverse was struck with two incuse squares. The coins were minted in Sardis. The gold and the silver were refined in Sardis from raw electrum in workshops in Sardis. Recent archaeological excavations have shown stratigraphically that the first Croeseids were indeed issued by Croesus before the Achaemenid invasion, and not after the Achaemenid as has sometimes been suggested. The gold coins had an initial weight of 10.7 grams. The silver coins also were issued in 10.7 grams, together with many smaller denominations, from 1/3 to 1/48. This makes it the world's first bimetallic monetary system though the idea of smaller silver denominations had originated in Cyme (Aeolis) under Hermodike II. bimetallic equivalence: 1 gold Croeseid of 8.1 grams was equivalent in value to 10 silver Croeseids of 10.7 grams. Soon after however, the gold coins were struck in a lighter standard of 8.1 grams. The modification of the weight may have been the result of a policy to exchange and remove all electrum coins in circulation with the heavier format, the 10.7 grams corresponding to the nominal weight of gold in a standard 14.1 grams electrum stater (about 70%). Once this was done the coins were lightened to 8.1 grams corresponding to the true weight of gold in the electrum coins, which had often been voluntarily debased. Reducing the weight of the gold stater to 8.1 grams also allowed to simplify the exchange mechanism between gold and silver, as now 1 gold stater of 8.1 grams corresponded precisely in value to 10 silver staters of 10.7 grams, or to 20 silver coins of 5.35 grams (weight of the future Achaemenid Siglos), since the current exchange rate on a weight basis was 1 to 13.3 at the time. The great advantage of the Croeseids compared to their electrum predecessors is that they were very reliable: the pure gold and pure silver coins all had a clear intrinsic value, entirely guaranteed by their purity and clearly defined by their weight, which, as an added benefit, was standard. On the contrary, the actual composition of various electrum coins was very hard to determine, so that the true intrinsic value of each coin could not be easily estimated. The royal symbol, or stamp, created by Aylettes gave the coins a declared value and today we still use a token currency, where the value is guaranteed by the state and not by the value of the metal used in the coins.Amelia Dowler, Curator, British Museum; A History of the World; http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/7cEz771FSeOLptGIElaquA =Symbolism= Alternatively, the lion - symbol of Lydia - and the bull - symbol of Hellenic Zeus Perseus 1:2.7 - http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus- eng1:2.7 - [Hercules] had Agelaus, from whom the family of Croesus was descended.\\" (from the Seduction of Europa1912-1996., Grimal, Pierre, (1991).

In the historical context of Lydia‚Äôs alliance with Agamemnon of Cyme, an arrangement sealed by the marriage of Greek Hermodike II, possibly Croesus‚Äô mother, to his father, Alyettes (AKA a later Midas). However, any peace between Lydians and Greeks is not to be confused with Croesus‚Äô attempted conquest of Miletus. Notwithstanding, the croeseid symbolism of peace between the Greeks of Asia Minor, Lydians and later Persians persisted long after Croesus‚Äô death - until Darius the Great introduced new coins c.500BC. Achaemenid Croeseids Achaemenid Croeseid, time of Cyrus the Great to Darius I. Circa 545-520 BCE. Weight: 8.06g, Sardis mint. The design of the animals is more rigid than the original Lydian issues. When the Achaemenid Empire ruler Cyrus the Great invaded Lydia, together with the rest of Asia Minor, he adopted the bimetallic system initially introduced by Croesus, and continued to strike gold and silver coins at Sardis according to the model of the Croeseid until around 520 BCE. The design of the animals though was more rigid, less natural, than the original Lydian issues. These coins were found in very fresh condition in the Apadana hoard, coins deposited under the foundation stone of the Apadana in Persepolis, dated to circa 515 BCE, confirming that they had been recently minted under Achaemenid rule. The deposit did not have any Daric and Sigloi, which also suggests strongly that these Achaemenid coins only started to be minted later, after the foundation of the Apadana Palace. Replacement of the Croeseids by Achaemenid coinage Under Darius I, the minting of Croesid in Sardis was then replaced by the minting of Darics and Sigloi, probably around 515 BCE. The earliest gold coin of the Achaemenid Empire, the Daric, followed the weight standard of the Croeseid, and is therefore considered to be later and derived from the Croeseid. The weight of the Daric would then be modified through a metrological reform, probably under Darius I. Sardis remained the central mint for the Persian Darics and Sigloi of Achaemenid coinage, and there is no evidence of other mints for the new Achaemenid coins during the whole time of the Achaemenid Empire. Although the gold Daric became an international currency which was found throughout the Ancient world, the circulation of the silver Sigloi remained very much limited to Asia Minor: important hoards of Sigloi are only found in these areas, and finds of Sigloi beyond are always very limited and marginal compared to Greek coins, even in Achaemenid territories.

He worked for CJBQ radio in Belleville, Ontario for 40 years as the sports director. He was involved with the local sports scene, and was president of the Ontario Hockey Association from 1967 to 1969. He moved up to the national level in 1969 becoming vice- president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) in 1969, and later served as its president from 1973 to 1975. Devine was president of the CAHA during a period when the National Hockey League and the World Hockey Association were competing for junior ice hockey players. He spent significant time over two years negotiating the drafting and development agreements with the respective professional leagues. He oversaw the split of Canadian Junior A hockey into Tier 1 and Tier 2, and the subsequent draft system. He helped lay the groundwork for a national midget hockey tournament which later became the Telus Cup. He was involved in planning both the 1974 Summit Series, and the 1975 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships partially hosted in Canada. He was part of the negotiations for Canada returning to play at the Ice Hockey World Championships, and the planning stages of what became the Canada Cup. He later represented Canada at the International Ice Hockey Federation, and was inducted into the Belleville Sports Hall of Fame. Early life William John Devine was born on February 22, 1919, in Toronto, Ontario. He was the son of John James Devine, and later served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. Radio career and local sports Starting in 1945, he was the sports director at CJBQ radio in Belleville, Ontario, for forty years until 1984. It was the first radio station in Belleville, and Devine was its first employee. He was the sports commentator for the local Belleville McFarlands ice hockey team, and travelled with them to Prague, and broadcast the game in which Belleville won the 1959 Ice Hockey World Championships. On August 20, 1960, Devine broadcast the Harmsworth Cup race for motorboats, won by the Canadian entry Miss Supertest III. He was known for finishing on-air broadcasts by saying, \\"to play a sport, you must be one\\". Devine later worked with Jack Miller, who would be his replacement at CJBQ. Devine also served as a president of the Eastern Ontario branch of Baseball Ontario, and was a commander of the Bay of Quinte Power Boat Squadron. He also served terms as president of the Ontario Sports Writers Association, and the Ontario Sportscasters Association. Ontario Hockey Association Devine was elected to the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) board of directors in 1959. He served as the OHA president from 1967 to 1969, succeeding Matt Leyden. Devine was in charge of settling the protested 1967 OHA Junior D Championship between the Tweed-Madoc Twins and the Mitchell Hawks. Mitchell protested the eligibility of five players, the lack of a scoreclock, the lack of a washroom in the visiting dressing room, and illegal goal posts. Devine ruled the five players eligible based on residency rules, and was able to get suitable upgrades to the arena to resume the series. Devine chaired the OHA committee which considered the application of the Western Ontario Junior B Hockey League to become a Junior A league in June 1968, but declined it due to the lateness of the application, and recommended the group remain as Junior B. The league instead proposed to operate outside of the OHA jurisdiction, and Devine warned the league of possible ramifications. He also urged local Belleville goaltender prodigy Steve Rexe to play for Canada men's national ice hockey team. Devine was succeeded by Tubby Schmalz as OHA president in 1972. CAHA vice-president Devine was elected the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) vice-president in charge of junior ice hockey on May 23, 1969, at the annual meeting. He served two years in the capacity, being re-elected at the 1970 meeting. During this time he oversaw competition for the Memorial Cup and its scheduling. He also worked on the disagreement between the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) and the CAHA regarding the use of overage players and distribution of development funds from the National Hockey League (NHL), which led the WCHL to leave the CAHA's jurisdiction. He stated the present draft agreement with the NHL expires in 1972, and it sets the upper age limit on junior hockey at 20, whereas the WCHL wanted it to be 21. Devine later said that the CAHA would also reevaluate its junior league classifications at the upcoming general meeting. At the 1970 CAHA general meeting, Devine proposed splitting junior hockey into tiers for better balance, and felt that too many leagues classified themselves as Junior A, just to compete for the Memorial Cup. CAHA delegates initially disagreed over the amount of development money from the NHL, that was allocated to the leagues under Devine's tiered proposal. His proposal was successfully implemented for the 1970‚Äì71 season, and including a draft system where Tier 1 Junior A teams were able to draft players from Tier 2 Junior A teams. At the 1971 CAHA general meeting, Devine was elected first vice-president of the CAHA, and served in that role for two years. The WCHL requested to revisit his tiered draft configuration, and wanted an exemption from the restrictions on inter-provincial transfers, since its league operates in three provinces. Devine agreed and proposed the NHL draft payments for players at American colleges, be distributed to the last Canadian club for which the draftee played. He also led the CAHA into more involvement in minor ice hockey and skills development, after seeing the results of the Soviet Union's development system during the 1972 Summit Series. CAHA president=First term= Devine succeeded Joe Kryczka as president of the CAHA, at the annual meeting on May 25, 1973. Devine aimed to put the fun back into hockey for children, and felt that hockey parents in Canada put too much emphasis on winning. He and the technical advisory committee of the CAHA shared the same stance against competitive hockey below age ten, and he spoke against parents that attempt to circumvent rules designed for balanced teams and fair play. He also felt that there were too many minor ice hockey organizations that were giving into parents' desires at younger age groups. In 1973, Devine announced that the CAHA sanctioned a new national midget hockey tournament for the top 12 teams in the country, which became known as the Wrigley Cup due to Wrigley Company being the initial sponsor. The 1974 event was scheduled at the Oshawa Civic Auditorium, with the winning team to earn a trip to the Soviet Union, and future events would be rotated around Canada. He also responded to an Alberta government report about junior hockey, and said its recommendation to eliminate player contracts would defeat the purpose of the CAHA, to provide a competitive structure in hockey. If player movements were unrestricted, the balance of power would shift to teams with more money. During the 1974 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Devine and Gordon Juckes were approached by Andrey Starovoytov of the Soviet Union, regarding having another Summit Series. On April 29, 1974, Devine represented the CAHA at an agreement for Team Canada to play the Soviet Team in a six-game series, and that Canada would be represented by players from the World Hockey Association (WHA). He became part of the directing committee for the 1974 Summit Series, and later extended it to eight games. Before the games in the Soviet Union, he announced that Team Canada would depart early, and play exhibition games versus Finland, Czechoslovakia, and hopefully Sweden. The remainder of his first year as president was consumed by negotiating development and draft agreements for CAHA players, with the NHL and the WHA. In May 1973, Devine met with the NHL to review details of the current agreement up for renewal on June 30, 1973, and prevent efforts by the WHA to deal independently with the WCHL. The WHA had recently signed junior-age players Mark Howe and Marty Howe, despite two letters from the WHA to Kryczka that the WHA would not do so. The WHA felt that development fees for the CAHA were too high, and took the stance that CAHA players were already professionals since they received a weekly stipend to cover living expenses. The existing agreement with the NHL provides education for players, and development funds for the junior teams. Devine doubted that the NHL would begin drafting players below the age of 20, despite internally discussing whether to renew the existing agreement with the CAHA, in response to the signings supported by WHA president Gary Davidson. Devine cautioned that a bidding war between the NHL and the WHA for junior players, would be detrimental to the amateur hockey system in Canada. Devine and the CAHA met with Davidson and the WHA in Toronto on September 7, 1973, along with Canadian Minister of Health and Welfare Marc Lalonde, and Sport Canada director Lou Lefaive to discuss long-term solutions. Devine announced a tentative draft agreement with the WHA on September 8, 1973, but he did not disclose amounts, pending ratification by both bodies. Payments were expected to be retroactive, and a clause was included for exceptional underage players to be drafted. On September 17, 1973, Devine announced that the CAHA and the NHL were close to a new draft agreement, also with a clause inserted to allow drafting players 18 to 20 years old of exceptional status. On March 29, 1974, the CAHA and the WHA signed a one-year draft agreement allowing for one exceptional player per WHA team to be drafted in the first or second round only. =Second term= Devine was re-elected to a second year as CAHA president by acclamation, on May 24, 1974. At the same meetings, he announced that the CAHA would shift the decision making to each individual province on how to rank its leagues within the pyramid of play, but also expressed reservation that too many leagues might rank themselves at too high of a tier. Also at the 1974 general meeting, he announced that the 1975 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships would be co- hosted in Manitoba and Minnesota. It was decided later that, an all-star team from the WCHL would represent Canada. On June 3, 1974, Devine announced that a meeting among Canada, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Sweden, and the Soviet Union, resulted in an agreement in principle to have open competition in IIHF World Championships, and be within Olympic regulations, which later became the basis for the Canada Cup. It was a welcome development, as he had previously stated it was difficult for Canada to field a competitive international team due to professional leagues controlling too many players. The announcement foreshadowed a potential World Cup of Hockey, and the possibility of Canada's return to international competition. In December that year, the CAHA proposed making its own international council independent of Hockey Canada, because Devine felt that one organization with its subcommittees was more streamlined. In August 1974, the report Investigation and Inquiry into Violence in Amateur Hockey was made public by Ren√© Brunelle, the Ontario Minister of Social and Family Services. The report was commissioned after the Bramalea Blues withdrew from the OHA due to violence in the 1974 playoffs. In response to the report, Devine said that the recommended financial support from the government to better instruct coaches and referees would only be beneficial. The CAHA later followed up on safety recommendations, and endorsed its first brand-name helmet in January 1975. In November 1974, Devine and the CAHA requested a follow-up meeting with the NHL, the WHA, and government officials to find long-term solutions to protect amateur hockey in Canada. Devine had been criticized by Ed Chynoweth of the WCHL, for failing to pressure the NHL and the WHA on the late payment of development money, and threatened to pull the WCHL out of the CAHA. Devine also came under fire from the new WHA president John F. Bassett in February 1975, when Bassett stated that his league will resume signing players 18 years of age and older when the one-year contract expired with the CAHA, until the legal age laws in Canada were changed. The agreement with the NHL regarding drafted players expired in May 1975, and Devine was unable to reach agreement on a renewal. He was succeeded by Don Johnson as president of the CAHA, at the annual meeting on May 22, 1975. Later life alt=Devine's gravestone After leaving the presidency of the CAHA, Devine was elected to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) governing council on July 24, 1975. He served in that position with the IIHF until 1978. During his time with the IIHF, it voted to allow professionals to participate in the Ice Hockey World Championships as of 1977. Devine said there were some issues to resolve before Canada decided to return to international play, such as the time of year which usually coincided with professional ice hockey playoffs. In a 1988 interview about his hockey career, he remarked that \\"when it comes to hockey, politicians get on and off bandwagons faster than anybody\\". Devine died at Belleville General Hospital on April 27, 1989, at age 70. He and his wife Minnie Woodman had two sons and one daughter. He was interred in the Wolfe Island United Church's Point Alexandria Cemetery. Honours and awards Devine received the Sports Federation of Canada broadcasting award in 1967. In 1973, he was recognized by Sport Canada for his contributions to amateur sport participation in Canada. He received the OHA Gold Stick award of merit in 1974, and was made a life member of the OHA in 1976. He received the City of Bellevlle Award in 1976. On May 23, 1979, Devine was given life membership in the CAHA. Devine received the Canadian Boating Federation award of the decade for the 1970s. He was inducted into the Belleville Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. He was also life member of the Prince Edward Power Boat Racing Club, and an honorary life member of the Metro Toronto Hockey League.

It contains a single species, T. simonattoi. Discovery and naming In 2014, it was reported in the scientific literature that S√©rgio Luis Simonatto with a team of the Museu de Paleontologia \\"Prof. Antonio Celso de Arruda Campos\\" had found the front of a theropod axis near S√£o Jos√© do Rio Preto.M√©ndez A.H., Novas F.E., Iori F.V. 2014. \\"New record of abelisauroid theropods from the Bauru Group (Upper Cretaceous), S√£o Paulo State, Brazil\\". Revista Brasileira de Paleontologia. 17(1): 23‚Äì32 Several years later Fabiano Vidoi Iori uncovered the rear part of the same vertebra. In 2018, the type species Thanos simonattoi was named and described by Rafael Delcourt and Fabiano Vidoi Iori. The generic name refers to the Marvel Comics character Thanos, invented by Jim Starlin. The character's name is itself derived from the Greek Œ∏Œ¨ŒΩŒ±œÑŒøœÇ, thanatos, \\"death\\". The specific name honours Simonatto. The holotype specimen, MPMA 08‚Äì0016/95, was found in the S√£o Jos√© do Rio Preto Formation, part of the Bauru Group and dating from the Santonian; in 2014 it had been dated to the Maastrichtian. It consists of an almost complete axis fused with an axial intercentrum. It is missing several processes at the front, rear and sides. The specimen is currently housed at the Museu de Paleontologia de Monte Alto, Brazil. Description The length of Thanos has been estimated at . Despite the incompleteness of the material, a number of diagnostic features are present; a well-developed keel becoming wider and deeper posteriorly on the ventral surface; two lateral small foramina separated by a relatively wide wall on each lateral surface of the centrum; and well-developed and deep prezygapophyseal spinodiapophyseal fossae. In view of these features, Thanos may have been more derived than other abelisaurids at the time. Phylogeny In their phylogenetic analysis, Delcourt and Iori (2018) recovered Thanos in a large polytomy with other brachyrostrans within the Abelisauridae. Their resulting cladogram is shown below: Thanos shared only two synapomorphies with the Brachyrostra. The front articular facet of the axis is more than twice as high as the rear articular facet. The rear facet is inclined to the front under an angle of less than 75¬∞. Paleoecology Thanos shared its environment with an undescribed larger theropod believed to be a megaraptoran of which a vertebra, specimen MPMA 08‚Äì0003/94, has been found at Ibir√°. This would imply that Thanos was not the apex predator of its habitat.

The first railroad to arrive in town was the Sioux City and Pacific in 1868. Eventually, eight railroads would serve Sioux City before consolidations reduced the number to six, making the city the tenth largest rail center in the country in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1912 the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) announced they would build a repair shop terminal in Sioux City. Construction began in 1916 and it was completed two years later. At its height during World War II, the terminal employed 560 workers. They overhauled 35 steam locomotives a day, servicing over 70 trains a day, and maintained thousands of rail cars every year. By the mid-1950s the number of employees dropped to ten after the railroad's conversion to diesel engines was complete. The railroad tore down many of the obsolete buildings and structures beginning in 1954, and the roundhouse was reduced from 30 stalls to six. The Milwaukee Road filed for bankruptcy in 1977.

His childhood friend and neighbor Anu (Ritika Singh) is in love with him. His routine includes spending time in his restaurant playing the guitar after it closes, and taking a walk back to his house. One night while he is about to close up and leave, Vennela (Taapsee Pannu) shows up in the restaurant requesting to help feed a homeless person. Kalyan is impressed with her in their first meeting. Vennela visits his restaurant regularly for the same reason, and Kalyan gradually falls in love with her. He proposes to her one day, but to his shock, Vennela cries upon hearing his proposal, saying she loves him too, but she came here to bid farewell. Vennela says she borrowed 2 million Rupees from a gang a few years ago for her father's heart surgery, and now she cannot repay it. The gang has threatened her family several times, and warned her they will abduct her if she cannot repay her debt the next day. Kalyan, who is in love with Vennela, agrees to repay her debt for her the next day. On his way home the very night, Kalyan encounters a car accident which makes him unconscious for 3 weeks, but also coincidentally, returns his sight. Waking up after 3 weeks, Kalyan is shocked to learn 3 weeks have passed, which means, Vennela could be in danger. He starts to look her for through clues she left while with him, but ends up finding nothing. Meanwhile, Kalyan and Anu's parents want the two to marry each other. To please his mother, Kalyan agrees to marry Anu, though he loves Vennela. The night before Kalyan and Anu's wedding, Vennela's father visits Kalyan's restaurant to ask for help, saying the gang abducted Vennela as threatened, because Kalyan didn't repay her debt.

Swan's teachings on how to manage mental health issues have often been described as unconventional and potentially hazardous and has received criticism for how she attracts fans. She has been nicknamed \\"The Suicide Catalyst\\", a play on her pen name \\"The Spiritual Catalyst\\". Swan and her teachings were discussed in a six-part audio documentary series by Gizmodo in June 2018. She was also the subject of a documentary film, Open Shadow: The Story of Teal Swan, which was released in 2017.  Biography  Swan was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico on June 16, 1984, growing up in Logan, Utah. She lived in Logan until her teens with her parents and younger brother, Sky. Logan had a high percentage of practicing Mormons in the city at the time, and Swan stated her religious differences meant that from an early age she felt she didn't conform. The religious and cultural differences between family and school life meant she didn't \\"fit in\\" at school and was often bullied due to her different beliefs. Adding to the cultural differences, Swan also states that she often spoke and acted differently to other children at the school. This combination meant at times the bullying was intense and had an effect on Swan from an early age. Aside from the bullying, Swan began to feel physically different from other children she spent time with. According to Gizmodo, Swan first noticed these physical differences when in class and other children didn't react to things Swan was experiencing. She has never divulged exactly what she experienced as a child. Years later, Swan's mother was interviewed for the film Open Shadow where she stated Swan had hypersensitivity while she was growing up, often reacting to sound. Swan has also alluded to this part of her childhood when journalists have quizzed her about claims of clairvoyance abilities. Swan has stated in numerous interviews that she was abused, raped and psychologically tortured from the age of six onwards by a family friend. According to an article in Huffington Post Canada, Swan claimed to have been the victim of ritualistic abuse by a satanic cult for over a decade. When Swan reached her teens, her mother in an interview said Swan had attempted to take her own life. Both parents agreed to take Swan to see a psychiatrist but stated in the Open Shadow documentary that none of the techniques worked. They turned to eastern medicine when Swan was in her teens, and rather than saying Swan was sick, they said she was gifted when she was experiencing hypersensitivity. During an interview with Ozy, the journalist noted that Swan's arms were \\"covered in scars,\\" as a result of the abuse she endured as a child. At the age of nineteen, Swan reportedly was able to reject advances from the cult who had abused her for over a decade and subsequently reported the abuse she had endured to the police. According to her, she was born with extrasensory abilities such as clairvoyance, \\"clairsentience\\", and \\"clairaudience\\". She has claimed to be an alien from the star Arcturus. She has claimed to be the reincarnation of Indian guru Sai Baba of Shirdi and remembers the life as clearly as her own. She claims to have been a victim of Satanic ritual abuse from the ages of 6-19, in order to cure her of her supposed extrasensory abilities. Part of this alleged abuse included being sewn into a corpse. In particular TV interviews conducted in 2014 by Chris Oswalt, regarding her ritual abuse, were sent to Fox9, Kivi 6 and Idaho News. Swan claims that she has memories of these events which were repressed, until a Salt Lake City based therapist helped her uncover them. An investigation was opened into her claims before being ultimately shut down due to several accusations being made against her therapist, Dr. Barbara Snow, who incited Satanic Panic.  Career  In 2011 she released the book The Sculptor in the Sky and started her YouTube channel. After 2012, her popularity grew having followers in several countries. In 2011, Swan hosted one of her first talks in Salt Lake City, Utah with around twenty people attending and was the first she uploaded to her YouTube channel. The company Teal Eye, according to the website, is meant to create changes in several different areas: alternative education, reforms in the global food industry, justice, animal rights and spirituality. Swan has focused her ministry on healing others of their psychological ailments, including suicidal thoughts and repressed traumatic experiences. She operates the Philia Center, a retreat center in Costa Rica. Her followers are called the \\"Teal Tribe.\\" In 2017, Teal Swan was the subject of a documentary about her life \\"Open Shadow: The Story Of Teal Swan\\". In 2018, a Gizmodo podcast ran a six-part series on Teal Swan and her self-help spiritual teachings on depression and how her techniques \\"process past trauma in order to overcome it.\\" The host, Jennings Brown, stated that Swan was not like your regular spiritual leader, with both her appearance and how she markets herself. At the time of recording, her YouTube videos had been viewed 55 million times. During 2015, she received her first major media coverage discussing the use of her mantra, \\"what would someone who loved themselves do?\\" Swan has frequently spoken about the best techniques to deal with anger. According to an Irish Independent reporter that attended one of her seminars in 2016, it was stated that suppression of anger can have dangerous consequences. Swan stated that when she suppresses anger, she becomes a \\"ticking time-bomb.\\" Swan's theory about anger is deciding on the difference between constructive and destructive anger. Kailash Satyarthi made similar remarks during his TED talk on anger.  In popular culture =Open Shadow film= In 2017, Teal Swan was the subject of a documentary about her life \\"Open Shadow: The Story Of Teal Swan\\". =Netflix: Explained= In 2019, Swan's teachings were analyzed by the Netflix series, Explained. The episode's general premise was to study online communities and how they influenced vulnerable people to carry out acts of violence or act completely out of character. It studied the vulnerability of the people who moved to Jonestown with Jim Jones, and how rational people could be driven to make strange decisions. Swan's teachings were first mentioned when severe social isolation was discussed, explaining how people in those situations are often the most vulnerable. Swan was then linked to this online community, as this is the type of person she attempts to assist with her advice and guidance. The commentator then spoke about online communities like Swan's, likening it to tech communities like Facebook groups or Reddit, but also the roles online communities can play in helping vulnerable people. =Others= Teal Swan has been documented in the Gizmodo podcast ‚ÄúThe Gateway‚Äù conducted by journalist Jennings Brown and the Maximum Fun podcast ‚ÄúOh No, Ross and Carrie!‚Äù  Controversy = Suicide diction and allegations = Teal Swan has said on YouTube \\"What suicide is, is pushing the reset button... There is nothing wrong with suicide\\". Additionally, two of Swan's followers have committed suicide, and opponents of Swan's methods have claimed Swan led them to their behavior. Swan's teachings are partly drawn from her own recovered childhood trauma, that she says left her with the same feelings. Her teaching methods sometimes involve participants imagining their deaths, occasionally by suicide. A Refinery29 piece notes that while Swan is not directly encouraging suicide and that she claims to have \\"the strategy to help people out of suicidal thoughts\\", nevertheless her \\"highly-triggering comments and extreme views on suicide that trickle into almost every piece of content Swan produces\\" are potentially harmful, as evidenced by the way Swan compares followers with suicidal thoughts to \\"stray cats\\" and \\"orphaned children\\".https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/08/205915/the-gateway-teal- swan-youtube-cult-jennings-brown = Cult allegations = Many have claimed Teal Swan is a cult leader, a claim Swan has vehemently denied.

The company is developing satellite end-of-life and active debris removal services to mitigate the growing and hazardous buildup of debris in space. History Astroscale was founded in 2013 by IT entrepreneur Mitsunobu \\"Nobu\\" Okada in Singapore. In April 2013, Okada attended an academic conference in Germany on space development where space junk was a hot topic. Many experts gave presentations on the issue and talked about potential solutions, but Okada was not impressed because no one had a real plan of action. Ten days later, he founded Astroscale to tackle the issue. On February 16, 2015, the company raised US $7.7 million in venture capital financing. The capital was used to set up an R&D; facility and office in Tokyo to accelerate the development of satellites and future space debris removal missions. On March 1, 2016, Astroscale announced a further US $35 million in funding and on March 21, 2017, incorporated Astroscale Ltd. in the United Kingdom. Astroscale announced it had completed a Series C funding round and raised US $25 million on July 14, 2017. On November 21, 2017, Astroscale and Surrey Satellite Technology signed a Memorandum of Understanding to pursue joint opportunities in areas of innovative on-orbit technologies and missions designed to safeguard the orbital environment for future generations. As a first step, Astroscale contracted SSTL to supply the Client satellite and avionics for its ELSA-d mission. Astroscale established a ground station in Totsuka-ku, Yokohama on July 4, 2018. The primary purpose of the ground station is to enable the operation of ELSA-d. On July 24, 2018, Astroscale received a ¬£4 million grant from the Government of the United Kingdom and established the National In-orbit Servicing Control Centre Facility at the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell, Oxfordshire. The facility will support advanced robotics activities in the very hostile environment of space, specifically enabling the provision of a commercial service for de-orbiting small satellites. The new facility will initially control Astroscale's ELSA-d mission. On October 31, 2018, Astroscale obtained additional funding of US $50 million, bringing total amount of capital investment to US $102 million. Astroscale announced the incorporation of Astroscale U.S. Inc. and the opening of its Denver office at the 35th Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado. With an additional US $30 million secured in an extension of its Series D investment round, Astroscale announced its plans to expand its United States presence, focusing on business development, policy influence and technology growth. On January 23, 2020, Astroscale announced it had been awarded a grant of up to US$4.5 million from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's \\"Innovation Tokyo Project\\" to build a roadmap for commercializing active debris removal (ADR) services. On June 3, 2020, Astroscale U.S. Inc. announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the intellectual property and other assets and to hire certain members of the staff of Effective Space Solutions R&D; Ltd., an Israeli satellite life- extension and servicing company. These moves make Astroscale the only company solely dedicated to on-orbit services across low-earth (‚ÄúLEO‚Äù) and geostationary (‚ÄúGEO‚Äù) orbits and bring the company closer to realizing its vision of orbital sustainability for future generations.  Missions  IDEA OSG 1 = In-situ Debris Environment Analysis OSG1 (IDEA OSG1) = Between 2015-2017 Astroscale designed, built, tested and launched a 25kg micro-lite satellite called IDEA OSG 1, an In-situ Debris Environment Analysis mission. The mission was designed to measure sub-millimetre size debris in low-Earth orbit. Unfortunately, the launch vehicle failed, and IDEA OSG 1 never made it to orbit. = End-of-Life Services by Astroscale (ELSA) = ELSA-d, scheduled to launch in 2020, consists of two spacecraft, a Servicer and a Client, launched stacked together. The End-of-Life Services by Astroscale (ELSA) program is a spacecraft retrieval service for satellite operators. ELSA-d (demonstration) is the first mission to demonstrate the core technologies necessary for debris docking and removal and is scheduled to launch in the second half of 2020. ELSA-d consists of two spacecraft, a Servicer (~184 kg) and a Client (~16 kg), launched stacked together. The Servicer is equipped with proximity rendezvous technologies and a magnetic docking mechanism, while the Client has a ferromagnetic plate which enables it to be docked with. The Servicer will repeatedly release and dock the Client in a series of technical demonstrations proving the capability to find and dock with debris. Demonstrations include target search, target inspection, target rendezvous, and both non-tumbling and tumbling docking. ELSA-d will be operated from the National In-orbit Servicing Control Centre Facility in Harwell, UK, which is being developed by Astroscale as a key part of the ground segment. = Active Debris Removal by Astroscale (ADRAS) = ADRAS-J Phase I scheduled to launch by March 2023. In February 2020, Astroscale announced its selection as the commercial partner for Phase I of JAXA‚Äôs first debris removal project. The JAXA Commercial Removal of Debris Demonstration project (CRD2) consists of two mission phases to achieve one of the world‚Äôs first debris removal missions of a large object, the first of which has been awarded to Astroscale. This first phase will be demonstrated by the end of the Japan Fiscal Year 2022 and will focus on data acquisition on an upper stage Japanese rocket body. Astroscale will be responsible for the manufacturing, launch and operations of the satellite that will characterize the rocket body, acquiring and delivering movement observational data to better understand the debris environment.

Conover was a founder of the Dayton Woman's Literary Club and served as its fourth president, from 1895 to 1897. She encouraged other writers, among them fellow Daytonian Paul Laurence Dunbar. In 1932, one of her lectures, Ramblings of an Ancient Daytonian, was reprinted in its entirety in the Dayton Daily News. The Dayton Daily News in 1940 called her \\"Dayton's foremost historian.\\" This obituary appeared on the front pages of the Dayton Daily News and the Dayton Herald, and on the editorial page of the Dayton Journal. NCR chairman of the board E. A. Deeds called her \\"perhaps Dayton's most outstanding citizen.\\" Personal life Conover married lawyer Frank K. Conover on October 14, 1879. They had four children, Elizabeth Dickson, John Charles Reeve, Wilbur Dickson, and Charlotte Mary. Awards and honors Conover was inducted into the Dayton Walk of Fame in 2007. Paul Laurence Dunbar dedicated his Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow to her. She is listed in Woman's Who's Who of America 1914-1915\\\\.

The club hosted educational discussions and lectures as well as social events, published a newspaper called the S. E. G. News, and operated the acclaimed Paul Revere Pottery. Financed by philanthropist Helen Storrow and run by librarian Edith Guerrier and her partner, artist Edith Brown, the club originated at the North Bennet Street Industrial School (NBSIS), a community charity building that provided educational opportunities and vocational training. Meetings were later held at the Library Club House at 18 Hull Street. Storrow also provided a house in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where club members could vacation in the summer.  Mission  The purpose of the club was to provide intellectual and social stimulation for the young working-class women of the North End, most of whom were from Italian Catholic or Eastern European Jewish immigrant families. At the time, the North End was an overcrowded tenement neighborhood with the highest child mortality rate in the city. Like many other clubs and charity organizations of the era, those at NBSIS were designed to Americanize young people by exposing them to middle-class White Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture. Additionally, Guerrier was instructed to \\"draw these girls in, from the perils of the street\\"; that is, to keep them away from saloons, dance halls, and other amusements which were seen as unsavory and leading to prostitution. In reality, most Jewish and Italian immigrant girls in those days were closely watched over by their families and forbidden to leave the house at night without a chaperone.  History = Founding = In 1899, a young art student named Edith Guerrier applied for a position in the day nursery at the North Bennet Street Industrial School. She approached the school's founder, Helen Storrow, with a letter of introduction from her uncle, William Garrison, Jr., who was an old friend of Guerrier's father. Soon afterwards, Guerrier was tasked with maintaining the school's reading room, officially known as \\"Station W\\" of the Boston Public Library. Her story-hour quickly gained immense popularity with young women at the school, forming the foundation of what in 1901 became the Saturday Evening Girls' Club (S.E.G.). = Activities = The multiple reading groups that Guerrier led were organized and named after the day of the week the women met; the Saturday Evening Girls consisted mostly of young women with jobs or family obligations that kept them busy the rest of the week. Through activities and group discussions, the S.E.G. exposed the women to an array of experiences across religious, language, and ethnic divides. Weekly meetings covered subjects such as music, literature, art, economics, and job opportunities. Often, prominent members of the Boston community would attend the S.E.G. meetings and give lectures or lead group discussions on historical or contemporary issues. Speakers included a variety of professionals, academics, religious leaders, activists, artists, and writers. The club also organized parties, plays, folk-dancing recitals, and concerts by local performers. Around 1906, Storrow bought a 14-bedroom house on Wingaersheek Beach in West Gloucester, Massachusetts, as a summer camp for club members. Storrow paid for a director and an assistant, and the members paid most of their own expenses. In addition to the funding from Helen Storrow, the club depended on volunteer work and donations. To raise funds, club members ran a restaurant and put on plays and other performances. In 1910 they staged a production of The Merchant of Venice at the home of Isabella Stewart Gardner. S. E. G. Club members contributed financially to the clubs for the younger women and girls, as well as mentoring them. Each member was also expected to contribute an hour of service each week to the clubhouse. In 1914, busy with other projects, Storrow withdrew her support for the library clubs, and the Saturday Evening Girls took over the responsibility. The clubs were moved to a space in the new North End branch of the library. Involvement in the S.E.G. provided the space to advance women's education in a manner that worked outside of traditional education methods, exposing the young women to opportunities for socializing without fear of provocation for being female, or for belonging to a specific religious group or ethnicity. The women participating in S.E.G. stand out from turn-of-the-century women at large, as S.E.G.'s members pursued higher education at a significantly higher rate than the native-born women surrounding them. = Notable speakers = * Cyrus E. Dallin * Paul Revere Frothingham * Edward Everett Hale * Heloise Hersey * Charles Eliot Norton * Vida Dutton Scudder * James J. Storrow * Edmund von Mach = The S. E. G. News = The club published a newspaper, the S. E. G. News, from 1912 to 1917. The editor in chief was Fanny Goldstein (May 15, 1895 - December 26, 1961), a Russian immigrant who had left school to go to work at 13. Goldstein continued her education part-time, taking evening classes at Simmons College (now Simmons University), Boston University, and Harvard University. She went on to head the West End branch of the Boston Public Library, where she worked with noted journalist and librarian George Washington Forbes. Goldstein conceived the idea for Jewish Book Week in Boston in the 1920s; her idea was later adopted by Jewish communities across the country. The S. E. G. News printed club announcements, editorials (such as \\"Dire Dress\\" by Fanny Goldstein), informational articles (such as \\"Telegraphy as a Vocation for Women\\" by Sarah Wolk), personal reminiscences (such as \\"Fifteen Years Later\\" by Frank Rizzo), poetry by Charlotte Perkins Stetson and Evelyn Underhill, children's plays by Edith Guerrier, book reviews, lists of recommended magazine articles, and advertisements for local businesses such as Hood's Milk. Contemporary issues such as Zionism and preparedness for war were also addressed. Newsletters such as the S. E. G. News made a small but significant contribution to the education of their readers. = The Paul Revere Pottery = In 1908, Edith Guerrier and Edith Brown, with financial help from Helen Storrow, started a small pottery in the cellar of their home in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. Soon afterwards it was moved to the basement of the Library Club House at 18 Hull Street. It was named the Paul Revere Pottery because of its proximity to the Old North Church, where friends of Paul Revere had famously hung two lanterns to signal to him that the British were coming. In 1915 it moved to the Aberdeen section of Boston's Brighton neighborhood. In 1916, it was incorporated as the Paul Revere Pottery Company. The pottery was more than an arts and crafts project designed to keep young women off the streets; it provided them with decent jobs. Working conditions at the pottery were better than the women could have expected elsewhere: they worked an eight-hour day and received a fair wage, daily hot lunches, and a yearly paid vacation. The pottery flourished for several decades, garnering national and international recognition through features in magazines, journals, and newsletters. It closed its doors in 1942. Paul Revere wares are now valuable collectors' items. = Disbandment = Although the club's membership began to dwindle after World War I, the Saturday Evening Girls continued to meet on an irregular basis until the club was dissolved in 1969. Papers and photographs pertaining to the club were collected by Barbara Maysles Kramer and are available in the Joseph P. Healey Library, University of Massachusetts Boston. 18 Hull Street, formerly the Library Club House, is a site on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.

It is situated northeast of the city of Copiap√≥. The lake is about long and wide with a surface area of about and a depth of about . A peninsula, probably formed by a moraine and subsequently modified by wind-driven accumulation of sand, separates the lake into a north- northwesterly and a south-southeasterly half with different colour and water composition. The lake is of tectonic origin and lies within a basin bordered by mountain ranges to the east and the west and two volcanoes north and south. It formed when the Astaburuaga River was redirected into the lake basin from the east, and this river is also its main source of water. Water levels have fluctuated over the last 6,000 years and the lake is currently in a period of low water level. In 1996 the lake was classified as a Ramsar site and it currently lies within the Nevado Tres Cruces National Park. In the past there were plans to redirect water flowing into the lake to the Copiap√≥ River; presently a mining company holds water rights to the Astaburuaga River.  Geography and geomorphology  Laguna del Negro Francisco lies northeast of the city of Copiap√≥ in the Atacama Region of Chile, and can be reached by south-bound roads that diverge from the Copiap√≥-Tinogasta road close to the Salar de Maricunga. A National Forest Corporation building is close to the southwestern shore of the lake. The area has been called a \\"scenic beauty\\". The lake lies at an elevation of , is wide and has a surface area of , but a depth of only about ; the Ministry of Public Works estimated a mean depth of in 1941. The water surface can fluctuate between from year to year. The lake is subdivided into a northern or northwestern and a southern or southeastern part by a high peninsula, on which wave action has led to the formation of sand spits. The peninsula was formed either by wind-driven accumulation of sand as a sandbank or as a moraine left by a former glaciation. Under present- day water levels, the sandbank separates the lake into two parts with different water composition: The southern part has fresher water and thus has a different colour than the saline northern part, as wetlands formed in the southern part. Regional rivers; Laguna de Negro Francisco and Rio Astaburuaga are upper-right of centre The land around the lake is formed by alluvial fans and in the eastern sector by alluvial deposits such as gravels, sands and silts. A number of mountains surround the lake, such as the high Copiap√≥ and the Jotabeche. The Astaburuaga River enters the lake on its eastern shore; it originates on the mountains east of Laguna del Negro Francisco where it is nourished by snowmelt. Other tributaries are the Quebrada Azufre in the northwest, Rio de la Sal in the northeast and Rio La Gallina in the southwest; the tributaries of Laguna del Negro Francisco feature wetlands and marsh vegetation has developed at the mouth of the Astaburuaga. = Hydrology and biology = The lake is polymictic, meaning that the water in the lake is usually layered but mixes over several times in the year. In sediments remnants of characeae, diatoms, ostracods and Ruppia have been found; today only one ostracod species persists in the lake. Flamingos exist in the area and the lake is an important site for birds. The watershed of Laguna del Negro Francisco covers a surface area of . The Astaburuaga River is the principal inflow; other creeks that enter the lake and groundwater play only a minor role. The mean discharge of the Astaburuaga is about , but it varies strongly over time, including at different hours of the day as the water of the river freezes and remelts. In addition, some water from the Astaburuaga River flows into the C√≠enaga Redonda basin rather than Laguna del Negro Francisco; presently, an alluvial cone separates the Astaburuaga River in the Valle Ancho gorge from the Salar de Maricunga/ C√≠enaga Redonda watershed. The lake has no outlet and is the southernmost closed basin in Chile; however during former lake level highstands the lake overflowed at into the Salar de Maricunga. The lake was once thought to be the source of the Copiap√≥ River.  Geology  Geologically, the lake is located in a north-south trending depression between the Andes in the east and the Cordillera Domeyko in the west; subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath South America is responsible for the formation of these mountain ranges. On these sides normal faults border the depression which is closed to the north and the south by the Quaternary volcanoes Copiap√≥ and Jotabeche, respectively. Oligocene to Pliocene andesites of the Negro Francisco Formation and Quaternary sediments cover the depression, the latter especially in the east. The depression extends past these volcanoes to the Salar de Pedernales and the Salar de Maricunga;  Climate and life  There is little information on the climate of the lake, but average temperatures are and precipitation mostly falls during winter from cold fronts and cutoff lows, with a probably smaller amount of summer precipitation; the total amount of precipitation is about . Evaporation is about six times larger than precipitation. The region is windy and is considered to be a cold desert. Vegetation is scarce at these altitudes and is classified as steppe vegetation. Animals found in the region include guanacos, pumas, vicu√±as and vizcachas, while birds include the Andean goose, three flamingo species Andean gull, Baird's sandpiper, crested duck and horned coot; in total there are about 17 bird species. The area is a protected area as part of the Nevado Tres Cruces National Park and was declared a Ramsar site in 1996, a site of international importance to waterbirds.  Lacustrine history  In the past, the Astaburuaga River did flow to the Salar de Maricunga; tectonic subsidence of the Negro Francisco Basin eventually led to a river capture involving a former tributary of the Astaburuaga reversing into the Negro Francisco basin and finally capturing the Astaburuaga itself. This event is responsible for the formation of Laguna del Negro Francisco within the basin, as without the Astaburuaga's input there would not be enough water to sustain a permanent lake. Older shorelines testify to higher water levels in the past exceeding the present-day water level by (at spillover point); other shorelines are found at , and above sea level. The maximum surface area of the lake reached . A wet period occurred in northern Chile, northwestern Argentina and the Bolivian Altiplano during the so-called \\"Lake Tauca phase\\", and in the climatically Mediterranean parts of Chile it ended together with the Pleistocene for not yet clear reasons. Underwater shorelines also exist, indicating that at times the lake level was lower than today. During the Holocene, the lake at times turned into a salt pan which only occasionally filled with water, such as between 6,000 and 3,800 years before present. Starting 3,600 years ago, a large wet period in the region made the lake grow in size and become less saline, with brackish conditions established between 3,000 and 1,800 years ago. During this wet period, glaciers in the region expanded due to the increased availability of moisture and peat bogs formed in valleys. After 1,800 years before present the lake became saltier again, either because of salt accumulation or because the lake shrank; the latter possibility is more likely. More recent fluctuations have occurred as well; a dry period may be associated with the little ice age. In 2012-2015 environmental degradation in the area has become apparent, accompanied by a shrinkage of water surfaces and dropping groundwater levels. = Human use = In prehistory, first pre-ceramic hunter-gatherers and later ceramics-using people who also engaged in horticulture were active in the area of the Astaburuaga River and the Laguna del Negro Francisco. The Inca were active in the valleys south and southwest from Laguna del Negro Francisco and also on the Copiap√≥ and Jotabeche. A 1921 publication mentioned a project to divert waters of the Astaburuaga River for irrigation purposes. Later, projects were devised which envisaged capturing the discharge into the lake in a canal and transfer the water through a tunnel into the Figueroa River, one of the headwaters of the Copiap√≥ River;) or to divert the Astaburuaga River into the Salar de Maricunga and from there into the Copiap√≥ River catchment. In 2009, a mining company held rights to divert about from the Astaburuaga River. The waters of the lake itself are not suited for either drinking or irrigation purposes.

Career  In 1970, Hargrave received a PhD from the University of Minnesota, where he studied with protein chemist Finn Wold. After post-doctoral work under William J. Dreyer at the California Institute of Technology, Hargrave joined the faculty at Southern Illinois University in 1973. In 1983, Hargrave and colleagues in his laboratory published the full amino acid sequence for rhodopsin, a photoreceptor protein, after having previously published partial sequences. The sequencing of rhodopsin was later described as a \\"monumental step\\" toward understanding the structure of rhodopsin. At the time, the purification of water-insoluble peptides was a challenge, and the Hargrave lab published several discoveries about how to manage them. Hargrave came to the University of Florida in 1984 as a Jules and Doris Stein Research to Prevent Blindness Professor and in 1990 was named the Francis N. Bullard Professor and Eminent Scholar of Ophthalmology and Biochemistry at the University of Florida. His work continued to explore the structure of rhodopsin, including developing a topographic model. He also pursued further research into the function of rhodopsin, including its role in visual disease such as retinitis pigmentosa and retinoblastoma. In 1985, Hargrave chaired and secured funding for the first FASEB Science Research Conference on Biology and Chemistry of Vision, which has become a biennial conference.  Awards  In 2000, he received the Friedenwald Award of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, which honors \\"outstanding research in the basic or clinical sciences as applied to ophthalmology.\\"  Selected works  *Hargrave, P.

Like other mountain rescue teams, SMRT does not confine itself to the immediate area and will respond to calls by emergency services and the public alike across a broad expanse of Northern England. History The team was formed in July 1968 with 12 local men; they now have a complement of 40 volunteers both male and female. In 2015, the SMRT signed a joint working agreement with the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service to attend large scale flooding events and water rescues. Whilst the SMRT cover over , they do not confine themselves solely to Swaledale, Wensleydale or even North Yorkshire. The SMRT have operated in York, Cumbria, and Whitby. As with most volunteer search and rescue teams, the SMRT does not receive any local, regional or national funding. It relies solely on the support of local people and organisations. During 2009, SMRT were involved in 30 callouts and 35 in 2010. Previous numbers had been in the high teens and low twenties; the rise in number of callouts was attributed to people Staycationing after the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 of the late 2000s. During 2016, the team were called out fifteen times to a variety of rescues including one where a Tesco delivery driver had driven off a small cliff near Leyburn in North Yorkshire. The SMRT work from a building located on the Catterick Garrison estate. The British Army used to charge the SMRT for use of their training land, but after the SMRT were called out to search for missing soldiers (one of whom had drowned), the army agreed to drop their levy to a peppercorn rent of just ¬£5 per year. Role The SMRT are used on the usual range of rescue and search operations. Notable examples of their involvement include; *The rescue of military personnel after a Puma helicopter from the Royal Air Force crashed near to Catterick Garrison (2007) *The search for Claudia Lawrence (March 2009) *The Workington/Cockermouth floods (2009) *The delivery of urgent medical supplies to remote areas of North Yorkshire cut off for over a month during the bad winter of 2010 (Kexwith, Helwith & Newsham) *The Tour de France in Yorkshire (2014) *The collapse of Tadcaster Bridge (2015) *The evacuation of families from flooded homes in Carlisle as a result of Storm Desmond (2015) *The North Sea Tidal Surge [Storm Axel] (January 2017) *The 2019 Yorkshire Dales flooding The SMRT have a sub-team known as the Swiftwater and Flood Rescue Unit (SWFRU) which responds to water-based incidents such as missing kayakers, people who are trapped in vehicles with floodwater rising around them and stricken cattle stuck in watercourses. The unit was formed in 2003. Whilst the traditional role on a Mountain Rescue Team is of rescuing people and cattle, SMRT have been called in by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority to help remove dumped rubbish. In 1999 the SMRT were asked to help out at the Buttertubs Pass as detritus such as a tractor wheel and a telegraph pole had been dumped down the holes on the pass. As the park rangers lacked the specialist equipment needed to access the pot-holes, SMRT were called in.

Description The species is described as having a pleurocarpous growth habit that forms soft carpets or turfs. It has regularly pinnate shoots up to 15 cm long. Branching may become irregular when growing on disturbed sites, such as mowed lawns. Branches are usually between 1 and 3 cm in length. The shoots of have a swollen appearance which is especially pronounced when moist. The leaves are yellow-green to dark green and are broadly ovate. They are distinctly recurved at the tip and have a single costa that extends midleaf. Stem leaves are between 2 mm and 2.5 mm in length, while branch leaves are slightly smaller and are found to be between 1 and 2 mm in length. The moss mainly propagates vegetatively, with sporophytes rarely being observed. The seta is relatively long, ranging between 2 and 5 cm. Sporophytes are not known to occur in North America. Leaf, magnification: 40x Lamina, magnification: 400x Habitat The original range of this species is not known, though it is classified as a European moss. The ambiguity of its original range also makes classifying where it is ‚Äòexotic‚Äô and in turn an invasive species within continental Europe very difficult. Outside of continental Europe, it has been found in the British Isles, Iceland, the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands, and much further in Jamaica, Hawaii, Chile, New Zealand, Southeastern Australia, and St. Helena, as well as scattered areas in North America and Asia. In these areas it is considered non-native.Miller, N. G., & Trigoboff, N. (2001). A European Feather Moss, Pseudoscleropodium Purum, Naturalized Widely in New York State in Cemeteries. The Bryologist, 104(1), 98-103. doi:10.1639/0007-2745(2001)104[0098:aefmpp]2.0.co;2 In natural settings, it can be found in areas of low to moderate elevation. It has a range of habitats including acidic and calcified grasslands, heaths, on banks, and among rocks and on rock ledges. It is a typical forest floor moss, especially characteristic of young, reforested areas. Although it is found in open woodland, it is not particularly shade tolerant. A study based in New York consistently found the species in association with several trees. In particular, it is associated with standalone or small groves of Picea abies and Thuja occidentalis. While it grows well in the area right under the canopy, it flourishes when leaf litter is sparse or entirely removed. It is often found in areas of high anthropogenic activity and disturbance. Primarily, it grows in the lawns of urban areas, cemeteries, forest edges, roadsides, and among discarded lawn clippings. On the Pacific coast, is considered a troublesome lawn weed. Spread Given their lack of study in the past, it is difficult to say how the species was introduced to these areas. The exception to this is the historical receipt of a packing shipment: :‚Äú...Dickson (1967) reported P. purum being used on St. Helena to pack nursery stock for shipment to Tristan da Cunha, and Allen and Crosby (1987) stated that labels for specimens of [Pseudoscleropodium] from Argentina included the information that the moss had been used as packing material, itself perhaps received in shipments sent to Argentina from Europe.‚Äù This points to the wide scale spread of the species in the form of an auxiliary material. On a local scale, the species likely has been disseminated inadvertently from one lawn to another by professional lawn-care workers. Bioremediation The species is a known to bioaccumulate heavy metals and nitrogen.Martin Nebel, Georg Philippi (Hrsg.): Die Moose Baden-W√ºrttembergs.

Dutton was baptized on 2 January 1684, the eldest surviving son of Sir Ralph Dutton, 1st Baronet MP of Sherborne and his second wife Mary Barwick, daughter of Peter Barwick of London, who was physician in ordinary to Charles II. He was admitted at Middle Temple in 1701 at the expense of hs grandfather, since his father had wasted away the family fortune.

He voted against the Administration when present, except on the repeal of the Septennial Act. Before the 1734 general election he agreed to stand on a compromise with the Tories, but withdrew when John Stephens intervened and broke the compromise.

Jack Woodward (born October 3, 1951) is a Canadian lawyer. He specialises in Canadian Aboriginal law and is the author of Native Law, which is considered the leading Canadian publication on Aboriginal Law. Woodward has practiced law since 1979, primarily in the areas of Aboriginal law and environmental law. He has represented more than a hundred First Nations groups and organisations in a wide variety of legal actions including the landmark case, Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia, the first successful Aboriginal title claim in Canada. In 1980 he ran as a political candidate for the New Democratic Party in the Canadian Federal Election for the riding of North Vancouver‚ÄîBurnaby. Woodward wrote the first draft of Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which provides constitutional protection to the indigenous and treaty rights of indigenous peoples in Canada. Ian Waddell, in his book Take the Torch: A Political Memoir, states that Woodward drafted the clause in January 1981, during negotiations in Ottawa with Minister of Justice Jean Chr√©tien. In 1988 he established the legal firm, Woodward and Company. He was also an adjunct professor of law at the University of Victoria for sixteen years, where he was instrumental in creating the University's first course in Aboriginal law. In December 2011 Woodward was instated as a Queen's Counsel for the Canadian province of British Columbia.

The dispute falls under the assertion by the Province of British Columbia who designates the targeted land as Crown Land, whereas protesters claimed that by allowing logging on Meares Island, there would be a direct interference with Aboriginal title. A court injunction was sought to halt MacMillan Bloedel‚Äôs operations until the claim was resolved. The Martin (Meares Island) case was adjourned by agreement of the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation, MacMillan Bloedel, and the governments of British Columbia and Canada. The injunction on logging is still in effect and none of the parties have requested resumption of the trial. = Tsilhqot‚Äôin Nation v. BC, 2014 Tsilhqot‚Äôin Nation v.

British Columbia is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of Canada and the first case to successfully establish a declaration of Aboriginal title over land that a nation had historically occupied. The underlying circumstances that established the reasoning behind that case begin in 1983 when the province issued licence to Carrier Lumber to begin logging in the remote areas of central British Columbia which was claimed by the Xeni Gwet'in band of the Tsilhqot'in Nation. The Xeni Gwet'in filed suit seeking a court declaration that would prohibit Carrier Lumber's commercial logging operations in this area, and establish their claim for Aboriginal title to the land. After 5 years at trial, both the federal and provincial governments opposed the title claim which resulted to a final appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court, led by McLachlin CJ, unanimously allowed the appeal. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Tsilhqot'in people were entitled to a declaration of Aboriginal title to the 1,750 square kilometre region they had historically occupied. = Fort McKay First Nation v Prosper Petroleum Ltd, 2020 Fort McKay First Nation v Prosper Petroleum Ltd, 2020 ABCA 163 = References  Canadian legal scholars 20th- century Canadian lawyers Canadian legal writers 1953 births Living people Canadian Queen's Counsel 21st-century Canadian lawyers Queen's Counsel 2001‚Äì ","title":"Jack Woodward"},{"id":"59079033","text":"241x241px RCW 34 (Gum 19) - H II region and the emission nebula located in the constellation Vela.

Mount Lougheed is a conspicuous landmark that can be seen from Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway at Dead Man's Flats which is east of Canmore.  History Mount Lougheed was named after Sir James Lougheed (1854‚Äì1925), a prominent lawyer, politician, senator, and cabinet minister. The mountain was originally named Wind Mountain by Eug√®ne Bourgeau of the Palliser Expedition, but was renamed in 1928 to honor Lougheed after his passing. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1928 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent was made in 1889 by A. St. Cyr, W.S. Drewry, and Tom Wilson. Mount Lougheed was the scene of the second of three related airplane crashes known as the Rescue 807 Crashes. Geology Mount Lougheed is composed of Palliser limestone, a sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Lougheed is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Lougheed drains into the Bow River which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River.

He was the Ugandan Minister of Finance under Idi Amin from 1971 until his high profile defection in London in 1975.https://www.newvision.co.ug/news/1010258/uganda-eur-finance-ministers- independence Early life and education=Early life= Emmanuel Bwayo Wakhweya was born in the village of Butiru in the Mbale District of Uganda on the 25th of December 1936. Wakhweya was of Bugisu ethnicity. =Education= Wakhweya began his education at the Bunyinza Primary School, which he graduated from in 1949. He then attended St. Peter's College in Tororo, Uganda, an all boys boarding school that Wakhweya graduated from in 1956. Wakhweya obtained a Bachelor's Degree from Delhi University in New Delhi, India in 1960. He came home to marry his childhood sweetheart, Christine Namataka In 1961. Career After finishing his Bachelor‚Äôs Degree with Honors at New Delhi University in India, Wakhweya returned home to become one of the first Ugandan district administrative officer on 5 September 1960 during the British colonial administration. Upon Ugandan independence from the United Kingdom, Wakhweya became the Assistant Secretary to the Treasury in the Milton Obote administration. This began a rapid career rise for Wakhweya in the Ugandan Treasury. He was promoted to Under-Secretary to the Treasury on the 4th of November, 1965, Deputy Governor Designate of the Bank of Uganda in 1968, and finally appointed as the Minister of Treasury on 1 January 1969. Following the successful 1971 Ugandan coup d'√©tat led by Idi Amin, Wakhweya was named Minister of Finance by Idi Amin for the newly formed administration, where Wakhweya was tasked with stabilizing the Economy of Uganda, which was rapidly deteriorating because of high state spending, a post-coup flight of foreign capital, and a lack of new investment from abroad. = Defection = During a visit in early January 1975, Minister Wakhweya defected in London on 20 January 1975. Wakhweya denounced Idi Amin and cited the chaos in the Idi Amin administration as having a negative effect on the economy and the lack of any ability to succeed as a finance minister in Idi Amin's one-man government. He was quoted as saying \\"It's hell to be in Uganda. I can't imagine how the ordinary people are still able to carry on because of the shortages of the simplest essentials of life and the soaring cost of living. Uganda is facing economic catastrophe. Either the economic forces will compel Amin to change his policies or there will be an explosion in the country because of popular discontent.\\" Wakhweya later sent a telegram to Idi Amin at the end of the week officially announcing his resignation and exile from Uganda. At the time of his defection, Wakhweya was the longest serving cabinet minister in the Idi Amin administration and the last remaining member of Amin's original cabinet. Upon his defection from Uganda and Idi Amin's government, Wakhweya and his claims of Ugandan economic instability were denounced in Uganda. Uganda Radio went on air announcing Wakhweya's defection by broadcasting, \\"Uganda's economy is much better than that of many other countries. His flight to London will not help him at all since Britain is also in economic chaos\\". On January 23, 1975, three days after the defection of Wakhweya in London, Idi Amin claimed that he would visit the United Kingdom to help the people of Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland seek self-determination, although like his threats to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1973 in Ottawa, Canada or to attend the Wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips, these threats failed to materialize. Wakhweya was succeeded as Finance Minister by Moses Ali. According to Amnesty International, relatives of Wakhweya still in Uganda were imprisoned, tortured, and killed following his flight and defection, in a similar manner to the torture and murder of relatives of Joshua Wanume Kibedi following his defection and denunciation of Idi Amin the year before. = Post-defection career = Following his defection in London, Wakhweya began a life in exile in the United States. He started his US career at the World Bank and lived in Vienna, Virginia. He served as a senior economist at the World Bank from 1975 to 1977 and Chief Loan Officer on Sudan from 1977 to 1978. Following his career at the World Bank, Wakhweya was appointed to be a senior economic affairs officer for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa in 1975 and moved to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, before his eventual return to Uganda where he served in various public service posts until his retirement.  Personal life  Wakhweya married Christine Namataka on 11 March 1961. They had one daughter, Dr. Angela Maria Wakhweya, and six sons together, Anthony, Richard, Stephen, Andrew, David and Emmanuel Junior. Wakhweya was a devoted Roman Catholic throughout his life, his wife more so. Wakhweya was also an avid sportsman, playing football and lawn tennis late into his life.

Completed in 1915, the building replaced Marquette Hall near Sacred Heart Church that had been built in 1888. It was designed by the Dubuque architectural firm of Fridolin J. Heer & Son. While the firm has several of its designs represented on the National Register of Historic Places, this is the only school building. The Sisters of St. Francis from Dubuque and lay teachers taught in the school, which had 640 students when it opened. Its early principals were laymen until 1952 when a Sister became the principal. A ninth-grade class for boys was begun in 1930 and tenth grade was added two years later. The high school program was discontinued in 1949 due to a teacher shortage. Enrollment in school was 900 in 1953 and 1,020, excluding the kindergarten, in 1956. The kindergarten program was discontinued the following year because of a lack of classroom space. Eventually, the school itself was closed. The former school building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. It is being converted into moderate-income housing. The historic status stems from its architect and its closeness to other church buildings.

As part of Public Works at The Public Theater‚Äôs mission of community engagement, the musical featured over 200 actors and community members. All performances were free and open to the public. Adapted from William Shakespeare's classic story, As You Like It explores themes of friendship, family, and love. Orlando, Duke Senior, his daughter Rosalind and niece Celia are exiled from their homes and flee to the magical and welcoming Forest of Arden where the characters find community, kindness and self-discovery. The production reflects New York City with a score of pop, R&B;, and folk music and diversity of cast members.

The New York Times named the production one of the best shows of 2017. = El Hurac√°n (2018) = In collaboration with The Sol Project, El Hurac√°n premiered on September 28, 2018 at the Yale Repertory Theatre. Written by Charise Castro Smith and directed by Woolery, El Hurac√°n is a bilingual, diasporic family drama focused on themes of memory, migration, forgiveness, and magic. Loosely based on The Tempest, El Hurac√°n takes place across multiple time periods and locations. As a severe hurricane threatens Miami, a mother, daughter, and grandmother prepare for the impending storm. In the play, hurricanes literally and figuratively affect four generations of Cuban and Cuban-American women: Valeria, the strong matriarch afflicted by Alzheimers, her daughter Ximena who acts as Valeria's caregiver, her granddaughter Miranda who left Miami for Harvard University, and Miranda's daughter Val whose story is told 27 years in the future. El Hurac√°n uses the metaphor of the hurricane to explore natural disaster, trauma and the loss of memory through Alzheimer's.

The Times critic Carol Migley awarded the opening episode four stars out of five, while The Daily Telegraph reviewer Michael Hogan gave it five stars out of five, describing it as \\"impressionistic, playful and unashamedly arty\\", as well as \\"bold, bewitching and slightly bonkers\\". The New Yorker included the series in an article about the best programmes available on streaming services, with reviewer Doreen St. F√©lix writing: \\"violently stylish, and also plain violent, Giri/Haji is a filial drama crossed with a sprawling, sexy police thriller\\".

Mangan complimented the \\"unfetishised\\" portrayal of Japan, but described the series as \\"a bore\\" and criticised the more familiar genre tropes. David Cirone of J-Generation criticized the series as going \\"heavy on theme, light on story\\", and NPR's Fresh Air critic John Powers noted that the show's \\"excesses can get a bit silly\\".

Large sweetly scented creamy-yellow or occasionally pink flowers appear in profusion in clusters in the leaf axils. Egg-shaped fruit long by wide taper to a blunt beak. Hakea recurva subsp. recurva sheds its seed quickly upon ripening. Taxonomy and naming Hakea recurva was first formally described in 1856 by Carl Meissner and Hakea arida in 1904 by Ludwig Diels. In 1999 William and Robyn Barker came to the conclusion that these two species were in fact too much alike to be in separate species. They changed the name Hakea recurva to Hakea recurva subsp. recurva and changed Hakea arida to Hakea recurva subsp. arida. The changes were published on pages 85‚Äì87 of Volume 17B of the Flora of Australia. Distribution and habitat This species is found north of Perth from the Murchison River through the central wheatbelt region of Western Australia to Kulin and east to Coolgardie.

He is best known for his appearances in the United States with the Honolulu, Hawaii-based promotion 50th State Big Time Wrestling in the late-1950s and 1960s.  Early life  Maiava was born in Tula in American Samoa on May 1, 1924. When he was two years old, his family relocated to Laie, Hawaii in the United States.  Professional wrestling career  Maiava was trained to wrestle by Al Karasik, debuting in 1952. In 1955, he wrestled for Ed Don George in Syracuse, New York as \\"Prince Ulu Maiava\\". From 1955 to 1958, he wrestled in Canada for the Calgary, Alberta-based Big Time Wrestling promotion as \\"Prince Maiava\\". In 1956, he briefly held the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship with Ray Gunkel while working for the Dallas Wrestling Club in Dallas, Texas. In 1958, Maiava began wrestling for the Salt Lake City, Utah-based Salt Lake Wrestling Club, where he and Oni Wiki Wiki briefly held the NWA World Tag Team Championship. In late-1960, he briefly wrestled for the World Wide Wrestling Federation in Washington, D.C.. Maiava became a highly popular wrestler due to his \\"combination of athletic ability, comedy and exotic flair\\". Playing on his Samoan origin, Maiava developed a \\"colorful and charismatic\\" character. He became known for antics such as performing fire knife dances, playing a ukulele, walking on a bed of nails, breaking wooden boards over his head, and wearing a necklace made from boar's teeth. During his matches, Maiava would use his wild hair to entrap and \\"cut\\" opponents' hands. His finishing move, the \\"Coconut Head-butt\\", gave rise to the professional wrestling trope that Samoan wrestlers have \\"hard heads\\". He was managed by Coconut Willie, who supposedly issued orders to Maiava by beating a drum. On one occasion, he wrestled a bear. To preserve the mystique of his character, Maiava did not speak English in public while travelling outside of Hawaii. In the late-1950s, Maiava began appearing regularly with the Honolulu, Hawaii-based promotion 50th State Big Time Wrestling. Between 1961 and 1966, he held the NWA Hawaii Heavyweight Championship on six occasions, trading the championship with wrestlers including King Curtis Iaukea, Gene LeBell, Hard Boiled Haggerty, and Gene Kiniski. He also held the NWA Hawaii Tag Team Championship on six occasions, teaming with Billy White Wolf, Lord James Blears, and Pampero Firpo. On August 16, 1961, Maiava defended his NWA Hawaii Heavyweight Championship in a bout with King Curtis Iaukea at the Civic Auditorium in front of approximately 3,000 people. After Iaukea won, members of the audience began rioting, with eight people ultimately arrested and nine people (including four police officers) injured. In October 1961, Maiava defeated Maurice Vachon in a hair versus hair match. Fellow American Samoan professional wrestler Fanene Anderson took his ring name, Peter Maivia, from Maiava. In 1968, Maiava and Maivia formed a tag team in 50th State Big Time Wrestling. Maiava retired from professional wrestling in 1974. He went on to run a tree-trimming company and purchased a portfolio of rental properties on Oahu.  Personal life  Maiava had five sons and four daughters. His grandchildren included American football linebacker Kaluka Maiava. In 1997, Maiava published \\"Da Grouchy Moocher Boogie Man\\", a children's book.  Death  Maiava died in his sleep on April 21, 2018 in Honolulu at the age of 93. At the time of his death he was reckoned by journalist Dave Meltzer to be the world's second oldest living professional wrestler. He was inurned with military honors at the Diamond Head Mortuary.

Originally written in Sanskrit, the work has since been translated into English by A. N. D. Haksar.  Description = History = Samaya Matrika, or The Courtesan's Keeper, was written by the Kashmiri poet Kshemendra. The poet was born in Kashmir in the 11th century, and much of his body of work was set in the Kashmir region. He studied both Vaishnavism and Buddhism, and was versed in several vedic texts.Warder, Anthony Kennedy (1992). Indian KƒÅvya Literature: The art of storytelling. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publ. . pp. 365 After years of recording, abridging, and translating various texts, the poet began to produce his own works, one of which would become Samaya Matrika.Kshemendra (2011). Three Satires: From Ancient Kashmir. Translated by Haksar, A. N. D. Penguin Books. . The work was produced post 1037, the year in which the author began to transition to writing original content. While many of his works were poems, historical epics, and abridgments of Hindu texts, Samaya Matrika was written to be a work of satire. The work pokes fun at the upper class (nobles and merchants), the clergy, the poor, the seasonal harvest, and the government. In doing so, the document has been cited as providing historians an insight into the day-to-day lives of people in the Medieval-era Kashmir valley. The story takes place in an urban setting, and there are notably a few mentions of far- away Chinese and Turkish peoples. = Plot = The work of satire follows the exploits of Kankali, a worldly Kashmiri courtesan who is given ward-ship over a younger woman, Kalavati. The two travel throughout Kashmir, with Kankali using her shapeshifting abilities to instruct her younger ward in the ways of the world; these lessons and observations in turn show Kalavati the general silliness of people. Kankali is also keen to point out the contradictions seen in people's behavior, such as priests re-selling temple offerings and monks breaking their vows. Alternatively, Kankali shows her ward the unsung nobility of others, such as a porter who carries water to nearby fields for farming and a noble magistrate who shirks personal wealth to deal fairly with the people.

Early life and education  Georgia Mae Dunston was born in Norfolk, Virginia to a hard working African- American family. Her parents did not attend college but instead worked various commercial jobs. Ulysses, her father, was employed as a cook at a commercial barbecue wholesaler and Rosa, her mother, worked as a cleaner, presser, and dishwasher. While growing up Dunston attended the local Baptist church and Sunday school. Close to graduating High school, Dunston was unsure about going to college since no one in her family had gone to college and she was expected to work. Despite this, she acquired a keen interest in Human biology and decided to continue her scientific education. Dunston ended up graduating in the top tier of her class and earned a full scholarship to Norfolk State University. Dunston received a B.S. in Biology from Norfolk State University and then, after being granted a Carver research Fellowship, gained a M.S. degree in Biology at Tuskegee University. Dunston used paper Chromatography and Electrophoresis to study biochemical differences in DNA in pigeons for her master's thesis. David Aminoff, now an Emeritus Professor at the University of Michigan, who taught Georgia biochemistry at Tuskegee was very impressed with her work ethic and performance, and aided her in gaining funding for a doctorate in human genetics. In 1972 Dunston earned a PhD in human genetics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Among other things, she found that the Xh and Pa 1 antigens are identical and that they could be isotypic markers. Additionally she found that anti-Xh was reactive in the sera of Old and New world monkeys but not of Prosimian or lesser mammals, concluding that the isotypic specificity among the higher mammals arose during the speciation process.  Career  After attaining her doctorate in 1972, Dunston took up a position as associate professor on the faculty of the microbiology department at Howard University. In 1975‚Äì1976, Dunston undertook a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Cancer Institute, alongside her faculty position, focusing on tumor immunology. During this time Dunston consulted for the Job Corps Sickle Cell Anemia Program for the U. S. Department of Labor, the Cancer Coordinating Council for Metropolitan Washington, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the Genetic Basis of Disease Review Committee. Dunston's Associate professorship ended in 1978. In 1982, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dunston was appointed as a scientist at the National Cancer Institute Laboratory of Immunodiagnosis. There she specialized in the immunogenetic characteristics of human killer cells. Three years later, Dunston was given the opportunity to direct the Human Immunogenetics Laboratory. During this stage of her career she was interested in genetic variations in human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and antigens and their relations with disease in African-Americans. Improvements in the understanding of these genes and antigens could aid the difficulties of receiving organ transplants for African-Americans, whilst also shedding light on their role in general immunological processes. Between 1988 and 1989 Dunston was the co-principal investigator of a NIAID grant to further work on transplantation for Native and African Americans, particularly in histocompatibility testing of transplantation antigens. From 1991 to 1994, Dunston acted as associate director of the Division of Basic Sciences at Howard University Cancer Center. During this time she contributed to a special report on organ donation for the black community. In the mid-1990s Dunston was one of the first researchers to join the then new Visiting Investigator's Program (VIP) in the National Human Genome Research Institute. She collaborated with the then director Dr. Francis Collins, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, publishing work on the genetics of type 2 diabetes in West Africa. In 2001, the partnership between Howard University and the NIH Office of Research on Minority Health provided the foundations for the National Human Genome Center (NHGC). Dunston founded and directed the NHGC with an \\"unprecented leadership\\" team at Howard University. Dunston and her team, at the NHGC and Howard University, built a national and international research collaboration focusing on the genetics of diseases common in African Americans and other African diaspora populations. As a full professor at Howard University, Dunston and her group's current research is centered on the exploitation of the power of population diversity in quantifying the information content of the human genome.

The Jing is a role type in Chinese opera for \\"rough\\" or \\"mighty\\" male characters. In many genres (such as Peking opera and Cantonese opera), this role requires heavy face painting. As a result, it is also known as Hualian (\\"Painted face\\"). However, not all characters with painted faces fall into this category, with Chou (clowns) being another major painted-face role type. This type of role will entail a forceful character, so a actor must have a strong voice and be able to exaggerate gestures. Depending on the repertoire of the particular troupe, he will play either primary or secondary roles. The colour and face design represents the identity and personality of the character. Face design Face painting in Chinese theatre probably began with masks, and actors painted their faces as early as 9th-century Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907). During the Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368) red and white facial designs were used in opera to distinguish good characters from bad ones. After the 14th century, facial patterns multiplied, and new colors have been introduced. Peking opera now boasts 15 basic facial patterns, but there are over 1000 specific variations. Each design is unique to a specific character. The patterns and coloring are thought to be derived from traditional Chinese color symbolism and divination on the lines of a person's face, which is said to reveal personality. Easily recognizable examples of coloring include:Ward, Barbara E. (1979) p.20 *Red, denoting uprightness and loyalty (e.g. Guan Yu) *White, representing evil or crafty characters (e.g. Cao Cao) *Black, given to characters of soundness and integrity (e.g. Bao Zheng) Later designs introduced other colors, such as: *Purple, indicating steadfastness and integrity *Yellow, showing impetuousness and boldness *Blue, suggesting resolution and daring *Green, meaning stubbornness and hotheadedness *Gold and silver, used for supernatural beings To emphasize a character's height and strength, the forehead is generally elongated, with the face design covering the entire face, from the crown to the chin and extending to both ears. Types Three main types of roles are often seen. These include , roles that heavily involve singing, , roles with less emphasis on singing and more on physical performance, and , martial and acrobatic roles.

They may be portrayed by either male actors or actresses. Subtypes The strategist Zhuge Liang is an example of a laosheng character. The young warrior Yang Wenguang is an example of a xiaosheng character. Attached to his helmet are two 6-foot long pheasant feathers, known as lingzi, which indicate his military profession. The sheng has numerous subtypes. The two major subdivisions are the laosheng (older gentlemen) and xiaosheng (younger gentlemen), with another important subtype being the wusheng (martial men). Peking opera troupes will always have a actor. A actor may be added to play roles fitting to his age. In addition to these main , the troupe will also have a secondary . =Laosheng= The () is a dignified older role, usually distinguished by a long, thin, three-part beard. These characters have a gentle and cultivated disposition and typically wear long robes with water sleeves, high-soled boots, and fabric headdresses. A subcategory is wulaosheng (), older generals who have combat skills. They wear armors and helmets instead of robes and fabric hats. Guan Yu, the Chinese god of sworn brotherhood, loyalty and righteousness, and Zhao Kuangyin, the first Song dynasty emperor, are the only 2 characters in the subcategory known as (), a red-faced older male. =Xiaosheng= Young, beardless male characters are known as (). They wear paler makeup than laosheng characters to show their youth. characters are often involved with beautiful young women by virtue of the handsome and young image they project. Depending on the character's rank in society, the costume of the xiaosheng may be either elaborate or simple. In Peking opera, these characters sing in a high, shrill voice with occasional breaks to represent the voice changing period of adolescence. The subcategories of xiaosheng are the wenxiaosheng () and the wuxiaosheng (). The wuxiaosheng roles possess martial skills and are frequently young generals. Often, their filigree helmets are appended with two long pheasant feathers known as lingzi (). =Wusheng= The () is a martial character for roles involving combat. They are highly trained in acrobatics, and have a natural voice when singing. In Peking opera, wusheng is further divided into 2 subcategories based on the character's costume: *The changkao wusheng () are high-ranking warriors who wear armors (kao, Èù†), helmets, and high-soled boots. They mainly use prop weapons. *The duanda wusheng () are individual fighters or disenfranchised criminals who wear tight jackets and trousers known as kuaiyi () or baoyi () and thin-soled boots. Some of them wear a beret known as luomao (). They are more likely to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Cross- gender acting In Yue opera, sheng roles have been mainly portrayed by actresses. Actresses playing men (sheng) is also common in some southern genres like Teochew opera and Taiwanese opera. It also appears in Ping opera.

Published in 2005 in Arabic by Jaber, it tells the story of an architect, Saman Yarid, who is waiting for the United Nations' Mehlis Report to be released in late 2005. The Mehlis Report takes the reader on a journey through Lebanese history regarding the lead up to the release of German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis‚Äô report to the United Nations on October 21, 2005 regarding the February 14, 2005, car bombing assassination of Lebanon‚Äôs former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Synopsis=Plot= The protagonist of Rabee Jaber‚Äôs novel is Saman Yarid, a 40-year-old architect living in East Beirut in late 2005, who, like many of his fellow Lebanese citizens, is greatly anticipating the release of the Mehlis Report on October 21, 2005. The narrator of the book is Josephine Yarid, Saman‚Äôs sister who was kidnapped in 1983 and is now watching over Saman from the afterlife as he walks around Beirut. For a few chapters, Josephine takes the reader away from Saman and focuses on what the afterworld is like. Although the Mehlis Report is all that anyone talks about, Saman never learns who Detlev Mehlis blames for the assassination of Hariri because Saman has a heart attack on October 20, 2005. Throughout the book, Saman reminisces about Beirut before warfare and explosions devastated the city, when his family and friends still lived there. Throughout the book, Saman and his girlfriend, Cecilia, discuss how different aspects of society have transformed. The book is structured so that the reader constantly wonders what is going on, while slowly revealing information. The reader finds out who the narrator is on page 131, when she says her name is Josephine, Saman‚Äôs sister. The reader also does not know who Mehlis is until page 24 in the book, when Saman tells Mary that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an international commission investigating things [‚Ä¶with‚Ä¶] German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis [‚Ä¶] presenting his report to the UN in just a few days.‚Äù The reader learns later in the book that Mehlis is conducting the UN's second investigation into the Hariri assassination because the first was led by Irish UN delegate Peter FitzGerald. =Characters= *Saman Yarid is the main subject of the novel. He is in charge of the Yarid Architecture and Design Agency, which is located in the middle of Beirut. He lives in Achrafieh, a neighborhood in Beirut. He has three sisters. All of his family left Lebanon years ago to avoid the violence. As he walks around Beirut at night, Saman experiences multiple events, such as witnessing two people playing around with a car at night. *Cecilia is Saman's girlfriend. She works at a store called Monoprix. *Josephine Yarid is one of Saman's three sisters. In 1983, she was kidnapped. Josephine is the narrator of the book, speaking from beyond the grave. She watches the daily routines of Saman on the televisions in the afterlife. *Mary Yarid is one of Saman's three sisters. She lives in Baltimore and is married to her cousin. She and her husband live with four children and own a Lebanese restaurant and a bakery. She keeps calling Saman, asking for him to visit. *Emily Yarid is one of Saman's three sisters. She lives in Paris and works for UNESCO as a translator. She keeps writing Saman letters begging him to leave East Beirut. Publication=Development= Rabee Jaber is a Lebanese novelist whose 18 books have made him distinguished in the Arabic speaking world. He was born in Beirut in 1972 and has been the editor of the Al-Hayat newspaper's weekly cultural supplement since 2001. Three of his books have been nominated for and another has been awarded the International Prize for Arabic Fiction, which was created in 2008 ‚Äì three years after The Mehlis Report was first published in Arabic. Jaber's writings, similar to the writings of many modern Lebanese authors, draw a lot of influence from Lebanon's civil war and the recent history of violence that has stuck with the Lebanese people. =Translation= Egyptian-American translator Kareem James Abu-Zeid translated The Mehlis Report from Arabic into English. An award-winning translator, Abu-Zeid also translated Jaber's Confessions, Najwan Darwish's Nothing More to Lose, and Dunya Mikhail‚Äôs The Iraqi Nights from Arabic into English. Historical Context=The United Nations' Mehlis Report= Detlev Mehlis was the head German prosecutor in the United Nation's investigation of the February 2005 assassination of Lebanon's former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri. The Mehlis Report was released on October 21, 2005, and found that high-ranking members of the Syrian & Lebanese governments were involved in the assassination. =Lebanese Civil War= The Lebanese Civil War, from 1975 to 1990, involved multiple groups fighting against one another and multiple foreign powers, such as Israel and Syria, invading Lebanon. An estimated 120,000 people died as a result of the Civil War.UN Human Rights Council. \\"Implementation of General Assembly Resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 Entitled Human Rights Council,\\" 23 November 2006, p.18. Following the Civil War, all militias were ordered to disband, but a few refused to do so and fought with the Lebanese Army over the next few years. Israel withdrew its forces from Lebanon in 2000. While the book takes place in 2005, the history of Lebanon's Civil War still has a big impact on the way Lebanese society functions and on the way the main character, Saman Yarid, sees his city. Themes Some themes in the book are death, family, and the afterlife. The narrator for the majority of the book, Josephine, is dead and discusses how her death and the deaths of other people have helped defined the Lebanon Saman knows so well. The family of Saman is an important aspect of the book because he is always thinking about them and they keep begging him to leave Lebanon and join them. Similar to death, talk of the afterlife is featured extensively when Josephine describes her situation and what it is like to be dead. Critical Reception Originally, few critics outside of Lebanon reviewed The Mehlis Report. However spreading abroad it picked up positive reviews. The New York Review of Books' Robyn Creswell, generally liked the book, saying that the book \\"is held together less by its plot or characters than by its uncanny way of capturing the zeitgeist.\\" The Nation reviewed the book positively, stating it \\"creates a foil in death to a governing culture\\", excellently considering the issues of Lebanon, its intelligence services and Lebanon society's inability to come to terms with its actions. NPR also rated the book positively, praising its ability to draw in readers into a different world while inspiring mourning for \\"this elegy for a lost Beirut\\".

At the age of 19, he engaged in protests at People's Drug Store at Lee Highway and Old Dominion Drive in Arlington Virginia. Following this particular sit-in, Diamond and others moved the sit-in to the Drug Fair at 5401 Lee Highway, where they were also refused service. One of the more noted sit-in's Dion was part of occurred in Arlington, Virginia at a drugstore on June 9, 1960.

However, it also specifically refers to three collections of jewelry which were recovered by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) in 1986, which the Philippine Supreme Court had ruled to be part of the Marcoses' unlawful wealth. The three collections of jewels sequestered by the PCGG have been come to be called the \\"Hawaii collection\\", the \\"Malaca√±ang collection\\", and the \\"Roumeliotes collection\\". The \\"Hawaii collection\\" refers to a group of jewels seized by the US Bureau of Customs from the Marcoses when they went into exile in Hawaii in 1986. The \\"Malaca√±ang collection\\" refers to a group of jewels which were discovered in Malaca√±ang Palace after the Marcoses fled the Philippines. The \\"Roumeliotes collection\\" refers to a group of jewels which were confiscated from Demetriou Roumeliotes, said to have been a close associate of Imelda Marcos, after he was caught trying to smuggle them out of the Philippines at Manila International Airport. In February 2016, the government of the Philippines announced that the three collections had been appraised at (about $21 million), and that they would eventually be auctioned off after having been kept unsold by the government for three decades.  Unlawful wealth  The Philippine Supreme Court considers the Marcos jewels part of the unlawful holdings of the Marcos family, based on the definitions set forth in Republic Act 1379, which was passed in 1955. The Supreme Court's interpretation of R.A. 1379 says that property acquired by a public officer or employee which is \\"manifestly out of proportion to his salary as such public officer and to his other lawful income\\" is \\"presumed prima facie to have been unlawfully acquired\\". The bulk of the assets of the Marcoses, including the Marcos jewels, were treated as unlawful in a 2012 decision which specified that \\"according to the Official Report of the Minister of Budget, the total salaries of former President Marcos as President from 1966 to 1976 was ‚Ç±60,000 a year and from 1977 to 1985, ‚Ç±100,000 a year; while that of the former First Lady, Imelda R. Marcos, as Minister of Human Settlements from June 1976 to February 22‚Äì25, 1986 was ‚Ç±75,000 a year\\" ‚Äì about $304,372.43. Collections= Malaca√±ang collection = When the Marcoses were ousted from power by the EDSA People Power revolution, they were forced to leave Malaca√±ang Palace very quickly in the early morning of February 25, 1986, leaving behind \\"a horde of treasures including 15 mink coats, 508 couture gowns, 888 handbags and, most famously, 3,000 pairs of designer shoes\\". Also left behind was a significant amount of jewelry including \\"well-set semi-precious stones made into belts, brooches, and earrings; white diamonds in gold tiaras; pink diamonds in gold bracelets; and diamond in gold buckle\\". This jewelry collection was placed in the vaults of the Philippines' central bank, and eventually came to be known as the \\"Malaca√±ang collection\\". Consisting of about 400 pieces, the Malaca√±ang collection is made up of smaller, less expensive jewelry compared to the Hawaii and Roumeliotes collections, and was estimated by the Sandiganbayan (anti-graft court) to be worth $110,055 to $153,089 in 2017. In January 2014, the Sandiganbayan had promulgated a decision declaring the jewelry collection to be ill-gotten. Imelda Marcos and her daughter Irene Marcos-Araneta petitioned the Supreme Court to reverse the ruling, but determined in a 2017 decision that the women had \\"failed to satisfactorily show that the properties were lawfully acquired; hence, the prima facie presumption that they were unlawfully acquired prevails\\". = Hawaii collection = Of greater value than the collection of jewels left behind in Malaca√±ang Palace was the collection the Marcoses attempted to bring along when they went into exile. Confiscated by the United States Customs Service when the Marcoses arrived at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii on February 26, 1986, this jewelry collection took US customs officials about a month to document, and was initially appraised at $5 million to $10 million. In 1991, Imelda Marcos entered into a settlement deal with the Philippine government regarding the Hawaii collection, surrendering it in exchange for the dropping of specific lawsuits which the government had raised against the Marcos family. The collection was eventually turned over to the PCGG, which put it in safekeeping at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) just like the Malaca√±ang collection. The jewelry pieces included in the Hawaii collection have been the subject of numerous public exhibits ‚Äì notably a public exhibit titled \\"A Story of Excesses: What Could Have Fuelled a Nation‚Äôs Development\\" by the PCGG in 2016, and \\"The Collection of Jane Ryan & William Saunders\\", an exhibit of 3D replicas of some of the jewelry pieces from the Hawaii collection, by Filipino artist Pio Abad and British jewelry-maker Frances Wadsworth Jones. = Roumeliotes collection = A third collection of Marcos jewels was seized when the Greek national Demetriou Roumeliotes attempted to bring them out of the Philippines at the Manila International Airport on March 1, 1986. The last of the three collections to be sequestered, it was also the last to be legally forfeited in favor of the Philippine government. The Sandiganbayan ruled in 2014 that the jewels would be forfeited in favour of the Philippines' Bureau of Customs, because the attempt to smuggle them out of the country was a violation of the Tariff and Customs Code. Although it consists of only 60 pieces, the Roumeliotes collection is considered the most valuable among the three collections.  Proposed auctions  Several proposals to auction off the Marcos jewels have been made since 2014, by which date the Philippine courts forfeited all of the collections in favor of the Philippine government. There have been several delays, however, including an appeal of the Sandiganbayan decision by Imelda Marcos and her daughter Irene Marcos Araneta over the forfeiture of the Malaca√±ang collection, which the Philippine Supreme Court upheld in January 2017. The Marcos jewels had still not been auctioned off as of April 17, 2020.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1982. Overview The cave is located in the upstream part of the Muroya River, a branch of the Jinna River, and was formed by erosion of a rhyolite outcrop on the river's left bank at an altitude of 200 meters. The cave is approximately 1.5 meters in width and extends for seven meters into the mountain. The interior was excavated from 1958 to 1959, during which time numerous examples of pottery from the earliest stage of the J≈çmon Period and the stone tools and hunting implements were discovered. The stone tools included many stripped fragments (stone waste generated during stone tool production), indicating that this site was a production base for such tools. These items are important materials for clarifying the origins of Jomon culture and were designated National Important Cultural Properties in 2000. The artifacts discovered are displayed at the Nagaoka City Science Museum and at the Age Regional History Museum in former Kamikawa village.

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served a State Representative for District 63 in the Rhode Island House of Representatives from 2009 to 2013. DaSilva is the first Mayor in the history of the City of East Providence as a result of the passing of a 2017 referendum that changed the city's governance from a city manager and city council form of government to a \\"strong\\" mayor and city council form of government.http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20181106/roberto-dasilva- elected-citys-first-mayor Previously, the title of \\"Mayor\\" in the city of East Providence was bestowed upon one of the city councillors that was selected by the councillors themselves, and was a purely ceremonial role. In contrast, the current mayor is elected by the citizens of East Providence and is the chief executive of city government. According to The Providence Journal, this new system mirrors that of other Rhode Island cities such as Providence, Cranston and Warwick.  Personal life  DaSilva is married to Karina DaSilva, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. Together they have two sons, Donovan and Dorian. Upon his election to the mayorship of East Providence, he retired as a Captain of the Pawtucket Police Department. DaSilva holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Roger Williams University. He is also the founder of the East Providence Youth Soccer Association and served as its inaugural president.  Rhode Island Legislature  DaSilva was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives from District 63 in 2008, serving from 2009 to 2013. During his first term, he served on the House Labor and House Municipal Government committees. In his second term, DaSilva served on the House Judiciary Committee. During his time in the legislature, DaSilva championed tougher domestic violence laws, closing the indoor prostitution loophole and full-day kindergarten. DaSilva was often at odds with his own party's leadership during his tenure.http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170305/political-scene-records- reveal-darker-political-arts-practiced-at-ri-state-house DaSilva was one of only a few Democratic legislators that voted against pension reforms pushed by Rhode Island General Treasurer (and later Governor) Gina Raimondo and future political rival Senator Daniel Da Ponte. This move was wide criticized as being too close to the state labor unions. =Reform of the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families= Representative DaSilva was a strong advocate of reform at the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth & Families (the DCYF). He worked with lobbyist and political scientist Nicholas Alahverdian to introduce several bills that would stop the practice of sending children and adolescents in Rhode Island state care to out of state facilities. DaSilva was featured in a Politifact article about the legislation inspired by Alahverdian, gauging the truthfulness of his claim that \\"We‚Äôre paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more,\\" to house children in state custody.\\" His claim was judged 'mostly true' as the amount was actually millions, not hundreds of thousands. Alahverdian suffered severe torture in several out-of-state placements, and DaSilva stood with him in the Rhode Island State House Rotunda as Alahverdian described what occurred within the DCYF. DaSilva remarked in a press conference that \\"I was very moved by Nicholas Alahverdian‚Äôs story and felt compelled to do something to eliminate the interstate transfer of young people in DCYF care. We have the resources in-state to provide children with the treatments they need, so I see no reason to send them hundreds, even thousands, of miles away from home. This makes an already traumatic experience even worse for a child.\\" DaSilva and Alahverdian's advocacy for DCYF reform received national coverage in August 2011. DaSilva's financial and ethical concerns were noted in an article published by the Associated Press and published worldwide. Alahverdian noted that \\"It's an inhumane approach to a human problem. These are the most vulnerable people in Rhode Island. We have the ability to provide for them here. And we're spending all this money to ship them across the country.\\" DaSilva agreed, stating: \\"The amount of money we're spending here is huge. There are facilities here in Rhode Island that could provide these services. And who does the oversight on these out-of-state facilities? Are they being watched as closely as the ones right here?\\" Alahverdian worked with DaSilva to reintroduce the legislation during the 2012 legislative session. The 2012 version of the legislation also included the rights for each child to contact a physician, attorney, and other child welfare officials to help ensure checks and balances on a child's right to be safe and know their rights. DaSilva said that \\"millions of tax dollars will be saved from outsourcing services to contractors, and more Rhode Islanders will keep their jobs\\" =Senate race= DaSilva did not seek another term in the House of Representatives in the 2012 election cycle. Instead, he declared his candidacy for the District 14 State Senate seat held by incumbent Sen. Daniel Da Ponte, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. By less than 80 votes, DaSilva narrowly lost to Da Ponte in the primary election.  Time out of office  After the 2012 election, DaSilva went on a six year hiatus from politics. During that time, he volunteered in the community, advanced to the rank of Captain in the police department of the city of Pawtucket, and founded the East Providence Youth Soccer Association and served as its inaugural President. Election 2018 In August 2017, DaSilva announced his candidacy for Mayor of East Providence. His first campaign event occurred the following month.http://reportertoday.com/eastprovidence/eastprovidence/stories/eps- first-announced-mayoral-candidate-has-kickoff,20733? In April 2018, DaSilva was endorsed by the East Providence Democratic City Committee.https://www.independenttownie.org/2018/04/dcc2018endorsements.html DaSilva's opponent in the general election was James Russo, a former assistant city solicitor and an ex-Chief of Staff to former Rhode Island congressman Robert Weygand. In the November 2018 general election, DaSilva defeated Russo with 52.2% of the vote. The Providence Journal remarked that the race for the office of the Mayor was \\"cordial\\" and stated that the \\"two candidates [agreed] on many of the major issues facing the city, including [...] a need to step up development of the waterfront, as well as to lower taxes and repair roads.\\" Mayor of East Providence=Transition and inauguration= During the transition from election to inauguration, DaSilva announced his nominees for the city's Municipal and Probate Courts. He also announced his selection for the offices of City Solicitor and Assistant City Solicitor. Each appointment required and was subsequently granted approval by the City Council. DaSilva's City Solicitor is Michael Marcello, both having known each other from their time serving in the House of Representatives. DaSilva was sworn into office and inaugurated on January 8, 2019. =Work as Mayor= DaSilva's first city budget as Mayor was proposed in September 2019. The $165.8 million budget included a tax increase that would assist in financing the construction of the city's new high school. The tax increase would add, on average, $104 to each homeowner's property tax bill. DaSilva submitted the budget to the East Providence City Council for review. The City Council ultimately voted against the Mayor's budget. In October 2019, the City Council's budget was passed by the City Council without the signature of Mayor DaSilva, and became the official city budget. He stated at the time that he did not support the budget because of its inclusion of drastic cuts to the human resources budget and no increase in the homestead exemption. DaSilva remarked that \\"While I have the utmost respect for the City Council and the budget process, I could not in good conscience approve this budget.\\" DaSilva outlined his concerns with the City Council's decision to deny portions of his proposed budget, stating that it was unwise to make cuts in the human resources budget as this omitted funding for training, recruitment and retention, and office supplies. DaSilva also proposed a .5 percent increase in the homestead tax exemption, and this was also denied by the Council. In November 2019, Mayor DaSilva created the Mayor's Council on Veterans' Affairs through an executive order, his first as mayor. DaSilva stated that \\"My administration saw there was great need to bring together residents who are dedicated to veterans' affairs and others in the community who represent organizations focus on the betterment of veterans' lives.\\" =Public safety appointments= In March 2019, DaSilva named William Nebus as the city's police chief after the retirement of Christopher Parella. In November 2019, Mayor DaSilva appointed Glenn Quick as chief of the East Providence Fire Department. =Impostor on Facebook= In August 2019, Mayor DaSilva warned the public about a fake Facebook profile that impersonated his name and image. The fake profile asked DaSilva's real friends to click on a link for free money. After being alerted by a member of the public, the Mayor advised his constituents and the press that this profile was not his. Facebook later removed the account.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 27, 1983. The area includes Michigan Avenue between Portage St. and the Grand Rapids and Indiana railroad line; also 105-141 E. Michigan Avenue. It covers 55 acres and includes 22 buildings. The district's boundaries were increased on May 2, 2011. History Early commercial development in Kalamazoo was along the Michigan Avenue corridor, just west of the Haymarket Historic District. In 1867, the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway constructed a rail line to the east of the commercial district, followed in 1870 by another line built by the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, which crossed Michigan nearby. The opportunities of the railroad spurred commercial growth farther to the east, into the Haymarket area. This area developed rapidly, woth buildings constructed between 1870 and the end of the century. The railroads also spurred an influx of German and German Jewish residents, following earlier emigrants who had settled in Kalamazoo in the mid-1800s. Many of these set up shop in the new Haymarket district. The commercial buildings in the Haymarket Historic District are associated with Kalamazoo's German and German Jewish communities, which established a presence in the area during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Early German and German Jewish businesses located in the district included the Sam Rosenbaum & Sons Company clothing factory and the Desenberg Grocery Company wholesale grocery. In the 21st century, the area offers shopping and dining opportunities and is home to the Kalamazoo Ballet Company. There are also several banks and the Arcadia Creek Post Office. Prominent buildings in the district include Arcus Depot (formerly the Grand Rapids and Indiana Line Station of the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad), The Wine Loft, London Grill, Kalamazoo City Savings Bank, Olde Peninsula Brewpub, and Ouzo's European Grill. Description The Haymarket Historic District is notable for the concentration of fine Victorian and early twentieth-century commercial buildings. The architectural styles represented range from Italianate and Late Victorian Panel Brick to Richardsonian Romanesque and to Sullivanesque (including one building actually designed by Louis Sullivan) to Neoclassical and Commercial Brick style. The Desenberg Building, individually listed on the National Register, is located within the district.

He served for six months in the year AD 728 (AH 110)., at 493. Hudhayfa succeeded Yahya ibn Salama al-Kalbi as governor towards the middle of 728. This was probably related to the change in the governorship in Ifriqiya. The previous governor, Bashir, a member of the Banu Kalb like Yahya, died late in 727 and his hand-picked successor was replaced early in 728 by the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik. The new governor of Ifriqiya was Ubayda of the Qays Aylan clan. Since the governor of al-Andalus was under the authority of the governor of Ifriqiya, by the middle of the year Yahya (perhaps dead) had been replaced by a Qaysi.Roger Collins, The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710‚Äì797 (Blackwell, 1989), p. 85. Hudhayfa is the last governor whose appointment by the governor of Ifriqiya with the consent of the caliph is recorded in the Chronicle of 754. All subsequent governors seem to have governed independently of Damascus.Ann Christys, \\"The Transformation of Hispania after 711\\", in Hans Werner Goetz, J√∂rg Jarnut and Walter Pohl (eds.), Regna and Gentes: The Relationship between Late Antique and Early Medieval Peoples and Kingdoms in the Transformation of the Roman World (Leiden: Brill, 2003), pp. 219‚Äì241. The Chronicle of 754 was written in Latin by a contemporary Christian from al-Andalus. It records that Hudhayfa‚Äîwhose name is spelled Odifa‚Äîwas in office for only six months. The Prophetic Chronicle (883) also gives him a term of six months, but the list of governors compiled by the Andalusian scholar Ibn Habib (878/9) has him ruling for a whole year. The 17th-century historian al-Maqqari follows Ibn Habib and dates his term from June or July 728 until April 729.Roger Collins, Early Medieval Spain: Unity in Diversity, 400‚Äì1000 (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995), p. 300. The Chronicle of 754 criticises Hudhayfa for unspecified \\"levity\\" or \\"frivolity\\" (levitas), implying that he lacked the virtue of gravitas (dignity) that was considered an imperative of high office.

During Huckel's 20-year partnership with Hazlehurst, they built many \\"notable country houses, churches, clubhouses, office buildings, banks, boathouses, police & fire stations, and bathhouses\\". After leaving Hazlehurst, Huckel partnered with Frank Rushmore Watson to form Watson & Huckel. At the very beginning of their association, they maintained an office in New York; the New York office is listed on only a few projects, including 1904 alterations for John Carstenson in Scarsdale, NY. Towards the end of his career and life, Huckel, with Watson, completed Worcester Union Station (1909‚Äì1912), the Cumberland County Courthouse (1915), and the Monmouth Hotel at Spring Lake‚Äîa \\"‚Ä¶GRAND SALON, IN LOUIS XVI STYLE.\\" (1916).

It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the continuity of the franchise's films. The season was produced by ABC Studios, Marvel Television, and Mutant Enemy Productions, with Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell serving as showrunners. Clark Gregg stars as a Life Model Decoy of agent Phil Coulson, reprising his role from the film series, alongside returning series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward. Iain De Caestecker also appears in the season in a limited role. The final season was ordered in November 2018, ahead of the sixth season premiere, and filming took place from February to July 2019. Post-production work on the season was completed that October. The season uses time travel to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D., and to tie up threads left by previous seasons. The seventh season premiered on ABC on May 27, 2020, and ran for 13 episodes until August 12, 2020. Though the season earned the series' lowest viewership, critical reception was positive. Critics commended the season's ability to explore different genres and settings through its time travel storyline and felt it served as a satisfactory conclusion for viewers, but were critical of the limited role Leo Fitz took in the season.

This early renewal was a surprise following the series' low rated fifth season, but Deadline Hollywood reported that it was likely due to the cast's contract negotiations and would help reduce costs by filming the sixth and seventh seasons back-to-back. Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said the series' crew had expected the shorter sixth season to be its last and were also surprised by the seventh season renewal. He attributed the decision to ABC watching early work on season six and believing the crew had found \\"another wave of energy\\" that they wanted to see continue. Responding to new rumors in March 2019 that the series would end with its seventh season, Loeb stated, \\"We're not ending.\\" However, ahead of the series' San Diego Comic-Con panel in July 2019, Loeb announced that the seventh season would be the series' last. He explained that the cast and crew had originally expected the series to end with the fifth season, and had put other plans on hold to make the sixth. When ABC wanted to renew the series for a seventh season, they agreed to return if it could be the final season. Having this knowledge allowed them to build the season specifically to \\"tie up any threads\\" and try to create a satisfying conclusion to the story. Although each episode of the season was allocated the same budget by ABC, the producers worked with the network to reallocate the budget across the season, to have the \\"backlot period costumes, which energized everybody and got everyone really excited\\" for the early episodes, and to save enough for the final episodes so the series could \\"go out with some scope and style\\". =Writing= Showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell, as well as the series' writers, chose to use time travel in the final season because visiting earlier time periods was the \\"only thing left on the list\\" for them and it allowed them to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. and revisit elements from throughout the series. The writers looked at other films and television series that have used time travel to see where they went wrong, and over or under explained concepts. They hoped to make a cohesive narrative for the season that was a \\"love poem\\" to the series and the fans. The story picks up from the sixth season's cliffhanger ending, which the writers were able to plan since the seventh season was ordered while they were working on the sixth. It features the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms, a recurring subplot in the sixth season. The seventh season begins in 1930s New York, prior to the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D., before exploring more time periods, such as the 1950s and 1980s. Unlike earlier seasons, the seventh is not broken up into different \\"pods\\" due to its shorter 13 episode run. The writers tried to create more episodes in the season that were \\"outside of [their] normal form of storytelling\\", like the third season episode \\"4,722 Hours\\". Whedon felt that the season ended up using more of the writers' fun pitches that previously would have been dismissed, with Bell feeling the season was \\"more joyous\\" than in past seasons. Phil Coulson is a Life Model Decoy (LMD) in the season after the events at the end of season six, despite star Clark Gregg explaining that the actual Coulson never wanted to be turned into an LMD. Gregg did not want the character to become similar to Data from Star Trek, \\"the cyber being following [the team] around doing fast math\\". The writers found a different way to approach the character while still addressing \\"some of the stuff that classic AI characters have dealt with in the past\\", such as questioning his feelings and existence. Whedon added that the Coulson LMD \\"feels the same\\" as the actual Coulson, and he goes through \\"some virtual soul-searching\\" according to Gregg. Chloe Bennet said much of the season references back to the first season and the notion that \\"not all heroes are super\\". Bennet added that Daisy Johnson is more like her Skye personality in the season now she is \\"more comfortable with who she is ... what she wants to do is be with the people that she loves and cares about, and save the world.\\" Daniel Sousa becomes a love interest for Daisy in the season. Fulfilling the promise the writers had to give Daisy a love interest each season, they felt Sousa as a \\"man out of time\\" would work. Bennet was \\"hesitant\\" for her character to get another love interest, feeling her journey throughout the season was \\"about finding herself\\" and exploring her relationship with Coulson and her S.H.I.E.L.D. family. Yet, Sousa arrives and complements Daisy \\"in a way that she's completely taken off guard by\\", which Bennet felt was the only way a relationship would happen for Daisy. Sousa also forms a friendship with Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie. Natalia Cordova-Buckley said in the season, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez \\"sits back and becomes a team member\\", supporting Director Mack. Rodriguez has less of a personal struggle in the season than in the past \\"because she owns who she is and she‚Äôs now decided to be part of the force, as a unit and not as an individual\\". Regarding her relationship with Mack, Cordova-Buckley said the season would show \\"the true conclusion of their relationship, in terms of it getting really rooted and grounded\\". Through Deke Shaw, a man out of time, the series was able to address the various social and racial issues in the different time periods the team visits, such as him \\"understanding or coming to terms with the concept of white privilege or pointing out how absurd it is that there is any sort of inequality or racial inequality.\\" The absence of Leo Fitz for much of the season allowed the writers to bring Jemma Simmons and her grandson Deke Shaw closer together. The season was built with the character's absence in mind, and with the concept, once he returned, no time would have passed for the character\\". Fitz's absence also \\"made the eventual payoff all the more powerful\\", as it is revealed he and Simmons have a daughter. Whedon said \\"we did what we could, and we tried to make it rewarding with the pieces [we were given]. Sometimes it‚Äôs 3D chess,\\" continuing that the solution was to give the couple a \\"super-happy ending\\". The writers were always going to give Fitz and Simmons a happy ending, despite the many obstacles the couple faced throughout the series, since they were the series' \\"forever love\\". The happy ending was \\"a way to give the audience something that they wanted\\" as well. Tancharoen said they \\"had no idea\\" the ending of the series, in which the S.H.I.E.L.D. team virtually reconnect with each other, was \\"predicting the near future\\" of Zoom calls and social distancing, which came about because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whedon added that had the season been in development during the pandemic, a virus storyline would have been included and the season would have had a different tone. =Casting= With the season renewal, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, and Deke Shaw, respectively. The renewal did not include series' star Clark Gregg, but Jed Whedon stated in April 2019 that the producers \\"firmly believe that any season would have to have him in it\\". The end of the sixth season revealed that a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson would appear in the seventh season, with Gregg starring as the new version of his character. This was the writers' solution to wanting to bring the character back without reversing the stakes of his death after the fifth season. Despite being announced as a main cast member for the season, De Caestecker does not appear in the first ten episodes, as he was working on other projects, creating scheduling conflicts. Whedon stated the choice was De Caestecker's, with Tancharoen adding \\"it was time for him to go [and] explore new things\\". He first appears in flashback sequences in \\"Brand New Day\\". De Caestecker received special guest star credit for his appearances in the season. Joel Stoffer returns from past seasons in the recurring role of Enoch, a Chronicom ally of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Tobias Jelinek appears as antagonistic Chronicom Luke, and Tamara Taylor portrays the Chronicom predictor Sibyl. The seventh season introduces the character Wilfred \\"Freddy\\" Malick, father of Gideon Malick who appeared in the third season. Wilfred is portrayed by Darren Barnet in 1931 and Neal Bledsoe beginning in 1955. Cameron Palatas reprises his role as a young Gideon Malick from the third season, while Thomas E. Sullivan takes on the role of Wilfred's other son Nathaniel, who was portrayed by Joel Dabney Courtney in the third season. In August 2019, Hayley Atwell was reported to be reprising her role as Peggy Carter alongside Enver Gjokaj as agent Daniel Sousa from the series Agent Carter. Atwell later denied that she was involved with the final season, while Gjokaj's casting was confirmed in April 2020. Whedon and Tancharoen had previously worked with Gjokaj on Dollhouse and were excited to explore his character further on S.H.I.E.L.D. Bell said Sousa would be seen in a \\"different light\\" in the season. Whedon added that having Sousa allows Coulson, a \\"fanboy for S.H.I.E.L.D. history\\", to interact with that history. Gjokaj initially said he was uncertain how long his commitment for the season would be, saying he was being used \\"on an episode-by-episode basis\\". He ultimately appears in 10 episodes in the season, and Bell later stated that it was the producer's plan to make it appear that Gjokaj would only feature in one episode of the season in order to \\"surprise people\\" when he had a recurring role. Additionally, Dianne Doan recurs as Kora, Daisy's half-sister. In August 2019, Patrick Warburton was revealed to be reprising his season five role of Rick Stoner for the final season, and Patton Oswalt was revealed to be returning for the season in May 2020, portraying Ernest \\"Hazard\\" Koenig in 1931. He is the ancestor of the various present-day Koenig siblings that Oswalt portrayed in previous seasons. Dichen Lachman also reprises her season two role as Daisy's mother Jiaying, while Fin Argus plays a young version of Gordon, an Inhuman working with Jiaying. Philip Labe portrayed young Gordon in the second season, while Jamie Harris portrayed him as an adult. In July 2020, Gregg discussed actors that he wished could return for the seventh season, including Bill Paxton who portrayed John Garrett in the series' first season before his death in February 2017. Gregg said it would be \\"really amazing if there was some way to feel like we had the spirit of Bill Paxton with us\\" and teased that could happen in the season. Later that month, Paxton's son James Paxton was revealed to be guest starring in the season as a younger version of John Garrett. Briana Venskus, Maximilian Osinski, and Coy Stewart reprise their roles from previous seasons, respectively as Piper, Davis, and Flint, in the series finale. Rachele Schank also appears as a young Victoria Hand, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, who was portrayed in the first season by Saffron Burrows. =Design=Costumes Costume designer Whitney Galitz was joined by Jessica Torok during the season, before Torok took over after Galitz left the series to give birth to her daughter. Title sequence Nearly every episode features title cards reflective of the time period visited throughout the season. The first two episodes, \\"The New Deal\\" and \\"Know Your Onions\\", have an \\"old-style noir\\" title card reflecting the 1930s setting of the episodes, while the third episode features a title card with font that \\"appears to be lifted from a classic alien invasion movie\\", evoking the style of 1950s \\"classic sci-fi\\". The fourth episode, again set in the 1950s, has a film noir style, including being in black and white and featuring an opening sequence that is an homage to Sunset Boulevards (1950) \\"iconic\\" opening. The episode's title card is a \\"throwback-style credit intro\\". For \\"A Trout in the Milk\\", a 1970s-themed opening was used, and was the first opening sequence of the series to include \\"actual opening credits\\" along with voiceover introductions. Each actor's name featured clips of their character from past seasons. The seventh episode sees \\"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\" being typed on a black computer screen, referencing the \\"tech and hacker movies\\" of the 1980s. \\"After, Before\\" introduces an opening sequence the evokes Tron (1982) and Back to the Future (1985). The bright blue logo \\"travels across a black digital landscape made up of an orange and blue grid\\" which features coordinates, dates, and ticking clocks. =Filming= Production for the season began at the end of February 2019, in Culver City, California. Elizabeth Henstridge made her directorial debut with the episode \\"As I Have Always Been\\", which she said was \\"different than anything [the series has] done before\\", resulting in it being shot \\"in a whole new way\\". Filming wrapped on July 30, 2019. Post-production work on the final episode was completed around October 7, 2019. =Music= After contributing additional music to earlier seasons, Jason Akers is credited as co-composer for the seventh season alongside the series' original composer Bear McCreary. McCreary said Akers \\"knew the show like an encyclopedia\\", and added that he was grateful that he decided to promote Akers as co-composer because of the many \\"creative and logistical challenges\\" that the pair faced during the season. The composers introduced a new time travel theme in the season that uses time. It was created to be a \\"consistent and memorable\\" through line for all the various musical genres featured in the season, which include \\"1940s noire saxophones, 1950s theremin, 1970s wah-wah guitar and bongos, and 1980s synths\\". The two composers worked to blend each of these different styles with the series' \\"pre-established classic orchestra and contemporary electronics\\". =Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins= In August 2019, Whedon and Tancharoen indicated that there would be a connection to the MCU in the final season. The various time periods visited in the season allowed the writers to incorporate different Marvel-related Easter eggs. In the third episode, which features Daniel Sousa, references are made to the second season of Agent Carter, including the defeat of Hugh Jones and the Council of Nine. The fifth episode depicts \\"Project Insight\\", a major plot point in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), as taking place in the 1970s due to the Chronicoms changing history. Instead of using the Quantum Realm to travel between different points in time as depicted in Avengers: Endgame (2019), the characters initially follow the Chronicoms through \\"tides\\", which are \\"critical launch windows leading to specific points in time and space\\". Discussing the apparent inconsistencies with Endgame earlier in the season, Thomas Bacon from Screen Rant noted that the time travel rules in the film were changed during production and were not completely consistent within that film, and opined that the series' explanation could help clarify the film's rules. Bacon suggested that the film's explanation that changing the past cannot change the future aligned with the series' idea that small ripples in the timestream would not change the overall flow of time, while the film's statement that removing the Infinity Stones from the timeline would create alternate realities with significant changes aligned with the series' idea that large changes would create a different future. As the season progresses, the S.H.I.E.L.D. team and the Chronicoms ultimately alter events in the past, creating a new timeline. After doing so, the team tries to ensure events in this new timeline happen correctly, such as protecting Jiaying from Nathaniel Malick to ensure Daisy is born. Jamie Jirak at ComicBook.com felt this was consistent with Endgames time travel rules. In the season finale, Fitz confirms that the team was operating in a branched timeline and helped them return to the original timeline by traveling through the Quantum Realm. Marketing The first footage of the season was released in August 2019 at the D23 Expo. A new teaser and poster for the season were released to coincide with the season's premiere date announcement in mid-April 2020, with the poster featuring an \\"old-school\\" World War II-era S.H.I.E.L.D. logo due to the season returning to that era via time travel. A week later, the main poster for the season was released featuring art by Kyle Lambert. The poster depicts the season's main cast members in costumes from the different time periods that are visited throughout the season, with Marvel specifically asking Lambert to reflect the costumes and sets that were created for the series. The poster marketed the season as \\"The Final Mission\\". Jake Abbate at SuperHeroHype and Sam Stone of Comic Book Resources both compared the poster to the work of movie poster artist Drew Struzan. Release The seventh season began airing on ABC in the United States on May 27, 2020, and ran for 13 episodes, until August 12, 2020. In the United Kingdom, E4, which had aired the series since season three, announced they had no plans to air season seven. The season will instead be released on Disney+, starting with the first two episodes on November 13, 2020, and the remaining episodes following weekly. Reception=RatingsCritical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 100% approval rating, with an average score of 8/10, based on 14 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"Heartfelt and held together by the strength of its super cast's chemistry, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s final season is a fitting farewell to a beloved team.\\" Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club felt the season was giving off \\"strong Legends of Tomorrow vibes\\", saying, \\"The rollicking nature of its time-travel adventures, fused with a slightly more absurdist sensibility than past seasons, is giving these episodes the feel of a victory lap, the show loosening up and enjoying its high-concept potential without the worry of delivering the goods to ensure another year.\\" Ian Cardona of Comic Book Resources felt by having Coulson return (albeit as an LMD) and once again utilizing Hydra as an antagonist brought the series \\"back-to-basics\\" while still maintaining the fun nature of the series. Each member of the team was allowed \\"to shine\\" and \\"the focus is solely on the characters and the mission, which helps to create a tightly-knit adventure that doesn't waste any time.\\" Dave Vitagliano from Den of Geek said, \\"Even though season seven doesn‚Äôt rank among the series‚Äô best efforts, taken as a whole, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ends its 136 episode run as one of the most successful science fiction superhero television offerings and earns top grades overall.\\" Writing for io9, Rob Bricken felt by following Avengers: Endgame, which used time travel to adjust and determine the continuity of the MCU, allowed the season to benefit from Endgames \\"decision to free the MCU from the shackles of continuity. The show has been able to go through its Legends of Tomorrow-esque jaunt through the 20th century with the freedom to tell whatever story it wants and leave as many chronal messes as that story needs,\\" making the season \\"become as good and fun as the show‚Äôs ever been.\\" Bricken concluded that the time travel of the season could have looked \\"very different\\" had Endgame not done it first, since \\"Disney, ABC, and Marvel Studios wouldn‚Äôt have approved anything that even appeared like the TV series was having some effect on the MCU proper, no matter how minor.\\" Absence of Fitz Fitz does not appear in the season until the eleventh episode, due to De Caestecker working on another project when the season started filming. Ian Sandwell at Digital Spy felt it was \\"a mistake\\" to have Fitz and Simmons apart, with it feeling \\"as though Fitz is missing because it's what the show does ‚Äì and not because it's a necessary story mechanic.\\" Sandwell felt with the couple separated, as a \\"key element\\" of the series, it was hard for the final season to be the \\"victory lap and celebration\\" it should. After the fifth episode of the season, McLevy said \\"the show better start paying dividends... on [the FitzSimmons] story, because it has cut its own legs out from underneath by dragging out Fitz‚Äôs absence this long.\\" While sympathetic to De Caestecker taking time to work on other projects, McLevy called the extended absence \\"ridiculous\\" at the halfway point of the season, since Fitz's absence \\"isn‚Äôt making for great drama any more... By trying to have its keep- the-best-couple-apart cake and eat its mysterious-transformation too, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. lessens the impact of both. Right now, it‚Äôs just [Jemma Simmons] failing to express any concern for the biggest person in her life, and without revealing the causes for that, the storyline gradually deflates from the delay.\\" McLevy later added the \\"couple was the biggest emotional investment the show ever created, and they‚Äôve just sputtered it out in the final two seasons.\\" Syfy Wires Trent Moore stated it was \\"impossible to overestimate how much [Fitz's] presence has been missed this year\\". On the prospect of potentially seeing Fitz in the eleventh episode, Entertainment Weeklys Christan Houlb said, \\"this better be one of the greatest plot twists of all time to justify leaving one of the show's central characters out of the entire final season and crippling the show's most compelling relationship in the process.\\" =Accolades= In July 2020, TVLine listed Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. as one of the 15 best television series of 2020 so far, explaining that \\"expectations were measured\\" for the seventh season but it had proven itself to be \\"downright fantastic, totally fun and, with each passing episode, an affirmation of\\" the series' place within the wider MCU.

It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The series is produced by Marvel Studios, with Waldron serving as head writer and Kate Herron directing. Tom Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki from the film series. Sophia Di Martino, Owen Wilson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and Sasha Lane also star. With Marvel Studios developing a number of limited series for Disney+ centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, the series was officially confirmed in November 2018, along with Hiddleston's involvement. Waldron was hired in February 2019, and Herron had joined by that August. Filming of the series began in January 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia and was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed in September 2020. Loki is expected to be released in early 2021, and will consist of six episodes. It will be part of Phase Four of the MCU.  Premise  After the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), Loki uses the Tesseract to travel through time and alter human history.  Cast and characters = Main = * Tom Hiddleston as Loki: Thor's adoptive brother and god of mischief based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. This version of Loki created a new timeline in Avengers: Endgame (2019) beginning in 2012, so he has not gone through the events of Thor: The Dark World (2013) or Thor: Ragnarok (2017) which \\"reformed\\" the previously villainous character. Additionally, Sophia Di Martino, Owen Wilson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and Sasha Lane have been cast in undisclosed roles. = Guest = * Richard E. Grant  Episodes  Production = Development = By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for its parent company Disney's streaming service, Disney+, to be centered on supporting characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films who had not starred in their own films, such as Loki; the actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \\"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios, rather than Marvel Television who produced previous television series in the MCU. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was believed to be taking a \\"hands-on role\\" in each series' development, focusing on \\"continuity of story\\" with the films and \\"handling\\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films. Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed in November that a series centered on Loki was in development and that Tom Hiddleston was expected to reprise his role from the film series. Michael Waldron was hired as head writer and executive producer of the series in February 2019. He was also set to write the pilot episode. The series was expected to follow Loki as he \\"pops up throughout human history as an unlikely influencer on historical events\\". A month later, Feige stated that Loki is over a thousand years old in the MCU films, so the series would be exploring what he has done throughout his long life. He added that the interest for Marvel Studios in making the series was to work with Hiddleston more and explore the character of Loki beyond him being a supporting character in the films. Hiddleston explained in August 2019 that he had known about his cameo role in Avengers: Endgame (2019) when he filmed Loki's death for Avengers: Infinity War (2018), but he considered the latter to be the emotional end of his character arc. He then learned about the plans for a Loki series around six weeks before Infinity War was released, and kept the series a secret until its official announcement later that year. He expressed excitement about being able to change Loki in different ways by taking an earlier version of the character and \\"seeing him come up against more formidable opponents, the like of which he has never seen\\". Also that month, Kate Herron was revealed to be directing and executive producing the miniseries, which was confirmed to run for six episodes. = Writing = Hiddleston promoting the series at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con The series takes place after Avengers: Endgame, which saw Loki steal the Tesseract during the 2012 events of The Avengers (2012), which created an alternate timeline from the main MCU films. In the series, Loki uses the Tesseract to travel through time and alter human history. In August 2019, Herron stated that the series would be \\"taking Loki to an entirely new part of the MCU\\" while Waldron said it would \\"explore the questions we all have: where did Loki go after he picked up the Tesseract? Could Loki ever make a friend? And will the sun ever shine on him again?\\" Executive producer Stephen Broussard stated that in addition to the time travel element, the series would have a \\"man-on-the-run quality to it\\". Waldron also felt the series would explore the character's \\"struggle with identity\\", adding \\"over the first 10 years of movies, he's out of control at pivotal parts of his life, he was adopted and everything and that manifest itself through anger and spite towards his family.\\" Waldron added there would be an \\"unexpected\\" science fiction quality to the series. According to Feige, the series will tie-into the Phase Four film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). = Casting = With the November 2018 announcement of the series, Hiddleston was expected to reprise his role as Loki, with his involvement confirmed in February 2019 by Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn. In November 2019, Sophia Di Martino was cast in a \\"highly contested\\" unspecified role, reported to be a female incarnation of Loki. In January 2020, Owen Wilson joined the cast as \\"a prominent character\\", followed the next month with the casting of Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the female lead, also said to be \\"a prominent character\\". In March 2020, Richard E. Grant was cast in an undisclosed role for a single episode of the series. That September, Sasha Lane was revealed to have also been cast in an undisclosed role. = Filming = Filming began in January 2020, with Herron directing. The series is filmed under the working title River Cruise, with Autumn Durald serving as cinematographer. Location shooting took place in the Atlanta metropolitan area throughout the month of February. On March 14, filming for the series was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in September.  Marketing  A commercial for the series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and WandaVision was shown during Super Bowl LIV. Julia Alexander of The Verge said the footage \\"wasn't much\\" but offered \\"enough glimpses to tease fans\\". Haleigh Foutch at Collider felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's teasers \\"stole the whole show\\" and had \\"a lot to get excited about\\".  Release  Loki is expected to debut on Disney+ in early 2021, and will consist of six episodes. It will be part of Phase Four of the MCU.

In 2018, she was conferred the Padma Sri, the fourth highest civilian award, by the President of India.  Early life  Joddati was born in Kabbur village of Chikkodi Taluk in the Indian state of Karnataka. The youngest of six daughters, Sitavva was \\"promised\\" as a Devadasi to the community by her parents who believed that by doing this, they would be rewarded with a son. After undergoing a religious ritual at the age of 7, Sitavva was made a Devadasi. By age 17, she had born three children.  Career  Sitavva met Latamala, the Managing Director of Women Development Corporation, in 1991 who made her realise how degrading the practice of Devadasi was to the dignity of women. Sitavva decided to save herself from the Devadasi system. She and the other Devadasis who used to travel to southern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka to attend religious fairs began to speak up against the practice, and within a week, the number of dissenters had risen to 45 women. Soon after, Sitavva joined the Mahila Abhivrudhi Samrakshana Sansthe (MASS), an organisation dedicated to the eradication of the Devadasi system. Since then, she has rescued over 4,000 women and rehabilitated them with other jobs. She joined MASS when she was 17 and for over three decades, she has worked to uplift Devadasis and Dalits in Belgaum, Karnataka. She is the CEO of MASS organisation since 2012. The organisation has around 4000 former Devadasis as members. Joddati conduct aids and legal workshops and programmes on women and child rights, financial management, STDs and other issues. She has created over 300 self-help groups (SHG) that provide financial support to former Devadasis, through banks and micro-lenders.  Recognition  In March 2018, Joddati was conferred the fourth highest civilian honour of India, the Padma Sri, by the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind.

The daughter of Joseph Wilhelm Kaukonen and Karoliina Aila Koivisto, who came to Ohio from Finland, she was born in Lorain. The family later moved to Conneaut, where she attended high school. In 1911, she began studying medicine at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1915. She completed her residency at the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia. She first practised in Ashtabula. In 1920, she set up practice in Fairport Harbor. In 1921, she was elected mayor of Fairport Harbor, one of the first women mayors in the United States and the first in Ohio. She ran on a prohibitionist platform because of her experience treating patients suffering from abuse of bootleg alcohol. Although she was opposed to drinking and dance halls, she defended the bobbed hair, short skirts, dancing and jazz music of the Roaring Twenties; she was also opposed to corsets. During her time in office, Kaukonen and her council used licensing to control the pool rooms and soft drink establishments which had previously been selling bootleg whisky. Some operators were fined or put in jail. She received threats in response to her crackdown on the bootleggers and, at one point, she was assaulted. She resigned as mayor before the end of her term and left for Seattle in 1923. Kaukonen married in 1928. She later came back to Ohio, settling in Cleveland.
