Yang suspended his campaign on February 11, 2020, the night of the New Hampshire primary. On March 10, 2020, Yang endorsed Joe Biden for president. In April 2018, Yang released The War on Normal People, a book discussing job displacement, automation, and universal basic income (UBI), which are central to his campaign. Initially considered a longshot candidate, Yang gained significant support in early 2019 after appearing on the popular podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. He later appeared on numerous other podcasts, shows, and interviews during his campaign. Yang's rise in notability was accompanied by the development of a devoted online fanbase that was known as the \\"Yang Gang\\". In 2019, his campaign raised $1.7 million, $2.8 million, $10 million, and $16.5 million in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters, respectively. In 2020, Yang raised $6.7 million in January before suspending his campaign in February. Yang ultimately received about $41.6 million over the course of his campaign. Yang qualified for and participated in all six Democratic primary debates held in 2019. In 2020, Yang did not meet the polling requirement for the seventh debate, but he later qualified for and participated in the eighth debate. Yang's campaign strongly focused on the displacement of American workers through automation, a problem Yang claims was a major reason Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. To remedy this, Yang proposed the \\"Freedom Dividend,\\" a monthly UBI of $1,000 to every American adult. Another key aspect of his candidacy was what he called \\"Human- Centered Capitalism\\", which would have replaced several traditional economic metrics with an \\"American Scorecard\\". Yang initially supported Medicare for All, but later proposed preserving private health insurance. On electoral reform, Yang supported ranked-choice voting and the implementation of \\"Democracy Dollars\\" to drown out corporate donations. Yang proposed a version of the Green New Deal that would reduce dependence on fossil fuels through policies such as a carbon tax and support for nuclear power. Yang's other policies included the decriminalization of opiates and legalization of cannabis, support for abortion rights and LGBT rights, and stricter gun control measures. Background Yang graduated from Brown University in 1996, concentrating in economics and political science. He then attended Columbia Law School, earning a Juris Doctor in 1999. In 2011, Yang founded Venture for America (VFA), a nonprofit organization that encourages entrepreneurship by matching recent college graduates with startups in various cities across the United States. In 2012, President Barack Obama recognized Yang as a \\"Champion of Change\\" for his work with VFA. In 2015, Obama further recognized Yang as a \\"Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship\\". Yang stepped down as VFA's leader in March 2017. Yang has stated that he first took an interest in universal basic income (UBI) after reading Martin Ford's book Rise of the Robots. Andy Stern's book, Raising the Floor, further persuaded Yang to support UBI. Campaign=2017–18= Yang makes a speech in New Hampshire in January 2019. His book, The War on Normal People, is displayed. Yang's candidacy began on November 6, 2017, when he filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic primaries. Andrew Yang was the second Democrat to announce his candidacy for the presidency. The campaign began with a small initial staff working out of an apartment owned by Yang's mother. He is running on the slogans \\"Humanity First\\" and \\"Make America Think Harder\\" (MATH). According to BBC, Yang \\"is one of the first and most recognizable East Asian-Americans in history to run for president\\". He has stated that he hopes his \\"campaign can inspire Asian Americans to be engaged in politics.\\" Had he been nominated, he would have become the first Asian American to serve as any major party's presidential candidate, and had he been elected, he would have become the first Asian-American president. On April 3, 2018, Yang released The War on Normal People, a book discussing technological change, automation, job displacement, the economy, and the need for a UBI. In a press release on April 19, 2018, he announced that he would be personally giving one resident of New Hampshire $1,000 per month in 2019 to show the effectiveness of his UBI policy, the \\"Freedom Dividend\\". He announced that he would do the same thing in Iowa in 2019. On August 10, 2018, Yang was a keynote speaker at the largest Democratic fundraiser in Iowa, the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding. In 2018, he made seven trips to Iowa and six trips to New Hampshire, the first two states to vote in the primaries. = 2019 = First quarter  Yang speaks with attendees at the 2019 Iowa Democratic Wing Ding at Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa.

Yang's appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience has been credited as a major turning point in his campaign. Several media sources have also attributed Yang's rise in notability to his large group of online supporters, who informally refer to themselves as the Yang Gang and have made a large number of Internet memes about Yang and his campaign. Following his sudden rise in notability, Yang attracted the interest of some prominent alt-right figures and many users of /pol/, a forum on 4chan that is notorious for its alt-right politics. Yang himself has denounced any support from the alt-right. In an interview with The New York Times, Yang said that he is \\"getting support from quarters [he] wouldn't have expected\\"; regarding support from the alt-right in particular, he said \\"It's uncomfortable. They're antithetical to everything I stand for.\\" Yang has stated that he was confused by the support he has from the alt-right, because he doesn't \\"look much like a white nationalist\\".

Yang praised a federal judge's order to reinstate the primary, saying \\"I'm glad that a federal judge agreed that depriving millions of New Yorkers of their right to vote was wrong. I hope that the New York Board of Elections takes from this ruling a newfound appreciation of their role in safeguarding our democracy\\".  Fundraising  On March 11, 2019, Yang announced on Twitter that he surpassed the fundraising threshold of 65,000 donors, which qualified him to participate in the first round of Democratic primary debates. On June 28, Yang announced that he reached 130,000 donors, which met the fundraising criterion for the third round of Democratic primary debates. By November 30, Yang had over 300,000 donors according to his campaign. Yang speaking with attendees at a fundraiser hosted by Iowa's Asian and Latino Coalition at Jasper Winery in Des Moines In the first quarter of 2019, Yang raised $1.7 million, of which more than $250,000 came from \\"the last four days of the quarter\\". According to Yang's campaign, \\"the average donation was $17.92\\", and \\"99% of the donations were less than $200\\". In the second quarter, Yang raised $2.8M, an increase of $1.1M from the first quarter. The campaign stated that 99.6% \\"of its donors were small-dollar donors [who] gave less than $200\\". On August 6, Yang's third-quarter fundraising reached $2M, which increased to $2.8M on August 13, matching his total second-quarter fundraising. On August 15, he reached 200,000 unique donors. On August 17, Yang announced that among his campaign donors, \\"the most common jobs are software engineers, teachers, drivers, retail workers and warehouse workers\\" and the \\"biggest employer is the US Army\\". On September 1, he announced that the average donation was $25, and that the campaign had received no corporate political action committee (PAC) money. In the 72 hours after the third debate (held in mid-September), Yang's campaign raised $1 million, suggesting that it \\"is on track to raise significantly more in the third quarter\\" than in the second quarter, according to Politico. In the third quarter, Yang's campaign raised $10M, representing a 257% quarterly increase—the largest growth rate among the fundraising numbers of all candidates. The average donation was around $30, and 99% of the donations were $200 or less. According to The Washington Post, the campaign has raised a total of $15.2M and ranks first among all candidates \\"in percent of money coming from small-dollar donations\\". In mid-October 2019, the creators of a new super PAC, called Math PAC, announced that they would be spending over $1 million to back Yang's campaign \\"so that a first-time candidate's voice isn't drowned out\\". Vox noted that it will be \\"a test for the candidate, who says he wants to eliminate super PACs\\". On January 2, 2020, Yang's campaign reported that it had raised $16.5 million in the fourth quarter, representing a growth of 65%. On December 31, 2019, the final day of the quarter, the campaign raised $1.3 million in donations, which was its most lucrative fundraising day to date. On February 1, 2020, the campaign announced that it had raised over $6.7 million in January, including $1.2 million raised on January 31 alone. Yang ultimately raised about $41.6 million over the course of his campaign. Of this amount, about $39.8 million was raised by Yang's campaign committee while the remainder came from outside groups.  \\"Yang Gang\\"  Supporters of Yang's campaign are collectively known as the Yang Gang or #YangGang. Followers of Yang's campaign are collectively known as the Yang Gang or #YangGang. They have brought attention to his campaign on Reddit, 4chan, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other social media platforms, through the use of Internet memes and viral campaigning. Media outlets have noted that much of the content circulated through these platforms—including memes, GIFs, podcasts, and Twitter tweets—have been instrumental to the campaign. According to Mother Jones, Yang's supporters have coordinated on platforms such as Discord and Reddit in order to boost Yang on online surveys hosted by various websites, including the Drudge Report and Washington Examiner. According to Iowa Starting Line, Yang has been able to attract former Republicans, Independents, and Libertarians, and Yang believes that \\"he could build a much broader coalition to beat Trump in 2020 than anyone else in the field\\". On October 26, 2019, a march for UBI took place in New York City, and many of Yang's supporters attended. In South Carolina, there are more than 30 organized supporter groups, according to CBS News. In California, students and alumni from San Diego State University, University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Diego have participated in canvassing events for Yang's campaign. In addition, students from the University of California, Berkeley's Forward club, mobilized over 290 students to phone bank, canvass, and spread awareness for Yang's campaign.  Media coverage  Yang supporters in New Hampshire On multiple occasions, Yang's campaign and supporters have criticized media outlets, such as MSNBC and CNN, for their coverage of Yang. Incidents include cases of news outlets excluding Yang from lists of 2020 Democratic candidates or failing to mention Yang completely. On August 29, 2019, Yang supporters prompted the hashtag #YangMediaBlackout to trend on Twitter after a CNN infographic displaying the results of a poll included Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke but not Yang, even though the poll showed Yang polling three times higher than O'Rourke. Yang supporters have also criticized media outlets for providing disproportionately low coverage of Yang, pointing out that according to The New York Times, he has received some of the least coverage in cable news among the candidates, even though he was polling better than most of the field. On September 5, Yang tweeted that \\"Sometimes honest mistakes happen. But NBC and MSNBC seem to omit me on the regular.\\" He also provided several examples of omissions. In an evening broadcast on September 9, MSNBC misidentified him as \\"John Yang\\". The next day, Yang responded on Twitter, saying \\"John Yang? That's a new one.\\" The incident prompted the hashtag #WhoIsJohnYang to trend on Twitter. In early October, Yang called out CNN and MSNBC for excluding him in two fundraising graphics. Yang poses for a selfie with supporters in September 2019 at Roosevelt High School in Des Moines In early September, Yang's media coverage discrepancy was reported by several media outlets, including CNN. Axios noted that while Yang polling in the top six of the Democratic primary and \\"getting plenty of online attention\\", he was \\"being treated by the media like a bottom- tier candidate\\". Krystal Ball of The Hill observed that there was \\"a persistent pattern of ignoring Yang's candidacy\\" among media outlets such as CNN. Ball further noted that Scott Santens, one of Yang's supporters, \\"has been keeping track of the apparent slights via Twitter\\". On October 23, 2019, Santens released an article compiling the mainstream media's exclusions of Yang. In November 2019, Yang's campaign manager dismissed an apology by MSNBC for leaving Yang off of an infographic, which according to Santens's compilation, was the 15th time in the campaign cycle MSNBC or its related networks had wrongfully excluded Yang. On November 23, 2019, following the MSNBC-hosted November debate in which Yang received the least speaking time and was not called upon for the first 30 minutes of the two-hour debate, Yang publicly rejected a request to appear on MSNBC unless the network would \\"apologize on-air, discuss and include our campaign consistent with our polling, and allow surrogates from our campaign as they do other candidates An analysis from Business Insider found that Yang received significantly less speaking time at debates than would be expected by his polling numbers, and that Yang had the highest deficit between actual and expected speaking time of any candidate during any of the democratic debates. In November 2019, Business Insider reported that Yang is faring significantly better than many other Democratic candidates despite a lack of mainstream media coverage. In a December 2019 interview with NBC News, Yang suggested that him being Asian American may have played a role in the lack of media coverage. According to NBC News, some Yang supporters have \\"resorted to harassment\\", including targeting \\"reporters who have written about or addressed criticisms of Yang\\", but Yang has said that he does not agree with such behavior. In late December 2019, Yang ended his boycott of MSNBC stating that he prefers to \\"speak to as many Americans as possible.\\" In January 2020, MSNBC incorrectly referred to Yang as a \\"billionaire\\", and in the same month a CNBC graphic used a picture of Geoff Yang instead of the presidential candidate, also using a picture of Kirsten Gillibrand for Tulsi Gabbard. On February 7, The New York Times published an article based on some of the experiences of Yang's former employees, which Fox News describes as a \\"hit piece\\". It alleges Yang's insensitivity toward race and gender while discussing issues of racism and sexism, and circumstantial evidence for his social awkwardness, such as his having pressured employees to participate at company karaokes.  Democratic primary debates =2019= First debate  \\"MATH\\", which appears on Yang's hat and pin, is an acronym for \\"Make America Think Harder\\". In qualifying for the first Democratic primary debate, Yang met the 65,000 donor criterion on March 11, 2019. He also met the polling criterion, with 18 polls at 1% or higher. The Democratic National Committee determined at random that Yang would participate in the second night of the first debate, which took place in Miami on June 27. During the debate, Yang was asked only two questions. He had the least airtime of any candidate on both nights, speaking for a total of only two minutes and 56 seconds, which was less than one-fourth that of former vice president Joe Biden. After the debate, Yang, along with fellow candidates Marianne Williamson and Eric Swalwell, complained of microphone issues not allowing them to speak unless called upon when other candidates seemed to be able to freely interject at all times, though NBC denied the claim. The issues spurred frustration from Yang supporters and prompted #LetYangSpeak to trend on Twitter much of the following day. An NBC spokesperson said, \\"At no point during the debate was any candidate's microphone turned off or muted\\", but Yang and his supporters have provided video evidence they claim shows Yang speaking up but not being heard.  Second debate  The criteria for qualifying for the second debates were the same as for the first debates. Yang was assigned to participate in the second night of the second debate, which took place in Detroit on July 31. During the debate, Yang answered questions on topics including civil rights, health care, immigration, party strategy, climate, and the economy. Yang spoke for a total of 8.7 minutes, which was again the least time of any candidate on both nights. He was the only second-night candidate who did not spend any time in \\"back-and-forths\\" with other candidates. Yang drew attention for his decision to not wear a necktie in either debate. In his closing statement, Yang called out the media and the debate format, saying: In a September interview with Politico, Yang further clarified his stance on candidates attacking each other at the debates. According to Yang, there \\"is this sense of manufactured outrage and rehearsed attack lines\\", and as \\"a proxy for the American public\\", he finds \\"the process to be very false and somewhat misdirected\\". \\"It's not left, it's not right, it's forward\\" has been compared to a similar slogan used by the Green Party of Canada and the Dutch political party National Alliance.  Third debate  To qualify for the third round of debates, \\"candidates are required to both have 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2 percent support in four polls\\". On June 28, Yang reached 130,000 donors, thus meeting the fundraising criterion. After Yang had received what he considered to be his fourth qualifying poll, the DNC revealed that qualifying polls conducted by different organizations would not be counted separately if they were sponsored by the same DNC-approved sponsor. The ruling was controversially disclosed by the DNC on July 30, less than one day after Yang had obtained 2% in four polls, rather than on July 19 when the second of these polls had been completed. In spite of this, Yang qualified for the third debate after receiving 2% support in his fourth qualifying poll on August 8. The third debate was held in Houston on September 12. In his opening statement, Yang promised to \\"give a Freedom Dividend of $1000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families\\". During the debate, he addressed topics including health care, immigration, foreign relations, the War on Terror, corporate lobbying, and education and charter schools. Yang spoke for a total of 7 minutes 54 seconds, which was again the least time of any candidate. Some campaign-finance experts have questioned using campaign funds for payments such as those Yang promised in his opening statement, on the grounds that federal law bars personal use of campaign funds. However, Yang has said he has consulted lawyers about the proposal and that \\"he would not gain the same scrutiny if he gave money to a media company or consultants\\" instead of directly to Americans. On September 12, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian announced on Twitter his support for Yang's proposal and offered to finance it. On September 13, tech entrepreneur Justin Sun pledged to give $1.2 million to 100 Americans in 2020, saying that he wanted \\"Yang to help him select the recipients\\". In the 72 hours after the debate, Yang's campaign raised $1 million and collected \\"more than 450,000 email addresses from people who entered the online raffle\\", of which over 90% were new email addresses.  Fourth debate  The qualification requirements for the fourth debate mirrored those of the third debate, and Yang qualified before August 22. The debate was held on October 15 in Westerville, Ohio. During the debate, Yang stated his support of impeaching Donald Trump, but that it would not solve the issues that got Trump elected, such as job displacement through automation. He also discussed the economy, taxation, foreign policy, the opioid crisis, big tech, and personal data as a property right. Yang spoke for a total of eight and a half minutes, which was the fourth-least time of all candidates. During the debate, Yang proposed decriminalizing opioids, a stance that candidate Beto O'Rourke agreed with. Candidates Julian Castro and Tulsi Gabbard said that Yang's Freedom Dividend policy \\"was a good idea, and something they would consider if elected president\\", while candidate Cory Booker argued for a $15 minimum wage over UBI. Vox called UBI one of the winners of the debate, saying that Yang's campaign \\"has already elevated the idea in [American] policy discourse\\". Chris Cillizza of CNN called Yang one of the winners of the debate, observing that Yang has had a \\"remarkable rise in this race\\" and \\"is already having a significant impact on the conversation within the Democratic Party\\". The New York Post similarly labeled Yang a winner, saying that he \\"knows how to break through by speaking like a regular person\\". On Twitter, Meghan McCain praised Yang for starting the conversation on automation, calling it \\"incredibly impressive\\".  Fifth debate  The fifth debate was held on November 20. Yang spoke for a total of 6 minutes 43 seconds, the least time of any candidate. He discussed topics including artificial intelligence, foreign policy, child care, and combating white supremacy. Critics of the debate noted that it took over 30 minutes for the moderators to let him speak. Yang's short total speaking time and the long period of time before he was brought in sparked accusations from critics, including fellow candidate Tulsi Gabbard, of debate hosts MSNBC and The Washington Post suppressing Yang's speaking time. The incident sparked protests outside of the debate studio from Yang's supporters, who chanted \\"M-S-N-B-C, hands off our democracy!\\". During the debate, Yang said that climate change and artificial intelligence were among his top priorities. One notable moment was when Yang was asked what he would tell Russian President Vladimir Putin if he was elected President of the United States, and Yang responded that he would tell Putin, \\"Sorry, I beat your guy.\\" On Twitter, Glenn Greenwald said: \\"Yang's answer about the actual threats of the 21st century was way too smart, thoughtful and substantive for cable news and presidential political generally. Few things will affect humanity more than Artificial Intelligence in this century.\\" CNN's Chris Cillizza listed Yang as among the debate's winners, saying that he \\"came across as, by far, the most relatable candidate on the stage\\". Chris Churchill of Times Union wrote: \\"The other candidates blabbered on about millionaires and billionaires or the bad man in the White House while Yang, bless his heart, repeatedly turned the focus to families and children.\\" Dana Brownlee of Forbes called Yang's closing statement a \\"Mic Drop Performance\\" and \\"refreshing and riveting\\".  Sixth debate  In qualifying for the December debate, Yang met the donor requirement prior to August 15. By December 10, he had received the four required polls, becoming the seventh candidate and the only nonwhite candidate to qualify for the debate. Yang criticized the lack of minority participation during the sixth debate, and he later questioned a December 23 DNC fundraising video that excluded Tulsi Gabbard. The debate was held on December 19 in Los Angeles, California. Yang spoke for 10 minutes 56 seconds, the least time of any candidate. He discussed issues including foreign policy, the economy, climate change, impeachment, immigration, human rights, and racial equality. CNN's Chris Cillizza named Yang one of the winners of the debate, saying that \\"Yang's answers on any question he was asked were miles away from how his rivals answered them\\". Dylan Scott of Vox praised Yang's performance, saying that he \\"nailed his answer on being the only nonwhite candidate on stage\\" and that he \\"made a short and eloquent case\\" for the Freedom Dividend. = 2020 = Seventh and eighth debates  Yang met the donor threshold, but did not meet the polling requirement to qualify for the seventh debate, which occurred on January 14, 2020. Yang suggested that the DNC commission additional polls in an attempt to increase the diversity of candidates, but the committee responded that it would \\"not sponsor its own debate-qualifying polls of presidential candidates during a primary\\", citing the established practice of using independent polling for qualification. On January 26, Yang qualified for the eighth debate, which was held in New Hampshire on February 7. According to editors of The New York Times, Yang gave the second-worst performance of the night. Jamelle Bouie said he \\"knows how to turn a question to his priorities,\\" but \\"doesn't have anything to say beyond his pitch for a cash giveaway.\\" Elizabeth Bruenig said he \\"seems like a cool guy, and perhaps like the ideal candidate ... in a parallel universe where capital and labor cooperate with kindly comity.\\" Will Wilkinson said, \\"Yang has brought a welcome fresh perspective to the race, but he didn't have his best night.\\" Policies More than 160 policies are listed on Yang's campaign website. Yang's platform has three main aspects: UBI, \\"Human-Centered Capitalism\\" and \\"Medicare for All\\", which he \\"supports the spirit of\\", but does not commit to. His platform also includes numerous other proposals; more than 160 policies are listed on his campaign website. Equal Citizens has given Yang's democracy reform policies an \\"A+\\" rating, the highest ranking also received by fellow candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Tulsi Gabbard. Yang claims the problem of job displacement through automation is the main reason Donald Trump ended up winning the 2016 presidential election, stating that based on data, \\"There's a straight line up between the adoption of industrial robots in a community and the movement towards Donald Trump.\\" Many of his policies, including the Freedom Dividend, are structured as a response to this issue. =Freedom Dividend (UBI)= Yang's signature policy is the \\"Freedom Dividend\\", a $1,000-per-month universal basic income to all US citizens age 18 or older, regardless of employment status. Yang has stated that this will help compensate for the loss of jobs to automation and artificial intelligence and that it will foster \\"healthier people, less stressed out people, better educated people, stronger communities, more volunteerism, [and] more civic participation\\". Citing forecasting by the Roosevelt Institute, Yang stated that the dividend \\"would create up to 2 million new jobs\\" in the US. The dividend is opt-in, and would not be given to those who choose to remain in certain welfare programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, WIC, and Supplemental Security Income. Other programs would stack on top of the dividend, including Social Security, unemployment insurance, housing assistance, and veteran's disability benefits. Yang proposes funding the dividend—estimated to cost $2.8 trillion a year—through several avenues, including a 10% value-added tax on business transactions, a 0.1% tax on financial transactions, taxing capital gains and carried interest at normal income rates, a $40/ton carbon tax, and removing the wage cap on Social Security payroll tax. According to Yang, a value-added tax is necessary to combat tax avoidance by major technology companies like Amazon and Google, which routinely use accounting tricks to pay little in income tax. Yang expects \\"hundreds of billions in new economic growth and value\\" to be generated through the dividend and that it would save billions of dollars on incarceration, homelessness services, and emergency room health care. On the topic of whether the dividend should include the wealthiest citizens, Yang stated that it should be universalized \\"so it's seen as a true right of citizenship, instead of a transfer from rich to poor\\". Yang does not support raising the federal minimum wage but supports each state's right to do so, citing his belief that the Freedom Dividend renders a federal minimum wage increase less necessary. Fellow 2020 Democratic candidates Elizabeth Warren, Tulsi Gabbard, and Julian Castro have stated their openness to UBI. At a 2019 conference organized by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, economist and Harvard professor Greg Mankiw said of the Freedom Dividend: > I am attracted to something along the lines of the policy now being > championed by Andrew Yang ... It's pretty easy to see how this idea would > work. Value-added taxes are essentially sales taxes; they're used in a lot > of European nations, and they've proven remarkably efficient ways to raise > revenue, and because the dividend is universal, it would be simple to > administer. Skeptics of UBI cite a decrease in the growth of automation and doubt that the impacts of new technology will be negative; according to Rich Lowry, \\"as technology makes some jobs obsolete, it creates the space for new ones\\". Contrarily, Yang has cited studies demonstrating that the retraining of displaced manufacturing workers had success rates of . The National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that the dividend would cost over $3 trillion annually (more than three-fourths of the federal budget). Some UBI advocates believe that the Freedom Dividend would negatively affect low-income citizens; Yang's campaign clarifies that the cost of basic necessities would not increase significantly, while the cost of luxury goods would, and also that the dividend would decrease the amount of time spent \\"interacting with an unwieldy bureaucracy\\". Economics professor Melissa Kearney opines that UBI would not significantly reduce inequality, and that she has found \\"no compelling evidence that ... giving people money will generally lead to any appreciable increase in work or successful business creation\\". =\\"Human- Centered Capitalism\\"= Yang has criticized several commonly cited economic metrics as misleading; for instance, he prefers labor force participation rate to the unemployment rate and believes that median income and life expectancy are more accurate at measuring the health of the economy than GDP. According to Yang, the economy \\"systematically tends to undervalue many things, activities, and people, many of which are core to the human experience\\". His proposal, Human-Centered Capitalism, will include \\"measurements like Median Income and Standard of Living, Health-adjusted Life Expectancy, Mental Health, Childhood Success Rates, Social and Economic Mobility, Absence of Substance Abuse, and others\\". The policy aims to make \\"the economy work for Americans, not the other way around\\", direct \\"capital to investments to improve human welfare\\", and create \\"measurements around people, not dollars\\". In response to GDP having little-to-no influence on each citizen's well-being, Yang has proposed to create an \\"American Scorecard\\" to capture \\"the actual economic/well-being of the American people\\". He has listed several measurable indicators of well-being, including \\"Quality of life and health-adjusted life expectancy\\", \\"Happiness/Well-Being and Mental Health\\", \\"Environmental quality\\", \\"Income Inequality\\", and \\"Access to education\\". According to Yang, the American Scorecard will help set \\"policy goals against measurable indicators of well-being\\" and \\"measure progress on these goals\\". =Economy= Yang promotes equal pay for equal work and wants to alleviate the racial discrepancies in pay. He has also proposed to implement a mandatory paid-leave policy, which includes a minimum-leave policy for full-time workers and paid time away from work for contract workers. According to Yang, \\"Americans often want to move for better job prospects but can't afford the costs.\\" He wants to make it easier to move for work, and has proposed for the IRS \\"to create a program to refund up to $1,000 of moving expenses for any American relocating for work\\". Yang has proposed for personal data to be treated as a property right, saying: \\"Data generated by each individual needs to be owned by them, with certain rights conveyed that will allow them to know how it's used and protect it.\\" He opposes the deregulation of Wall Street, supports regulating social media as a public utility, and promotes a ban on robocalls. Yang has proposed a new type of credit system designed to incentivize traditionally unpaid caregiving contributions. He supports free financial counseling, stating that \\"it's important to ensure Americans have the knowledge they need to save and invest properly\\". =Electoral reform= Democracy dollars  Yang supports the implementation of what he calls \\"democracy dollars\\", where voting age citizens receive a $100 \\"use it or lose it\\" democracy voucher each year to give to candidates. The policy aims to drown out corporate money resulting from political lobbying and the decision of Citizens United v. FEC. According to Yang, democracy dollars would drown out corporate money from organizations, such as the NRA, by a factor of eight to one.  Partisan gerrymandering  Yang proposes to end partisan gerrymandering. According to Yang, gerrymandering \\"undercuts the basis of our representative democracy, and it causes people to believe their vote doesn't count\\". He aims to promote the use of \\"the efficiency gap to measure partisan gerrymandering when evaluating and drawing district maps\\". He also wants to use independent redistricting commissions and appoint \\"Supreme Court justices who support the use of sociological tools such as the efficiency gap to help end partisan gerrymandering\\".  Ranked-choice voting  Yang supports ranked-choice voting: \\"each voter ranks their top three candidates. ... If one candidate received over 50% of the vote, they win the election. If no candidate hit the majority threshold, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Then, everyone who listed that eliminated candidate as their first choice has their second choice considered, a process which continues until someone breaks 50%.\\" Yang claims that ranked-choice voting will lead to higher voter turnout, better capture voter preferences, allow for more moderate candidates, and lower levels of negative campaigning. His policy aims to adopt a voting system that combats partisanship and \\"better captures the will of the majority of voters\\".  Voting age  On April 3, 2019, Yang came out in favor of lowering the national voting age to 16. While other candidates have expressed openness towards the idea, Yang was the first to make it an official part of his platform. Through lowering the voting age, Yang aims to increase civic engagement and allow citizens \\"to influence policy that impacts their economic futures\\". =Energy and climate change= On August 26, 2019, Yang released his climate change plan, which involved nuclear power, zero-emission transportation, geoengineering, a carbon tax, and a renewable electric grid. Yang supports a Green New Deal and favors a reduction in carbon emissions with an emphasis on climate engineering. In addition to revitalizing the Environmental Protection Agency, his platform calls for a Global Geoengineering Institute to form inter-governmental partnerships. Yang is a proponent of bringing the United States back into the Paris Climate Agreement.  Nuclear energy  Yang is a supporter of nuclear energy. He believes that the US should invest more in nuclear technologies like thorium-based nuclear power and generation-IV nuclear reactors since they are safer and produce less waste than uranium-based nuclear energy and are not capable of being weaponized. In his plan for energy transition to low-carbon sources, he plans to invest $50 billion in research and development and expects the first reactors to be connected to the grid by 2027. He has also stated that he wants to make it easier for nuclear power plants to open up and wants to increase the amount of nuclear energy used in the US. =Health care= In addition to UBI, single-payer health care used to be a fundamental aspect of Yang's platform. However, his policy proposal released in December 2019 eschews from it in favor of a plan that focuses more on lowering costs and expanding coverage. Prior to releasing the proposal, Yang clarified that while he supported Medicare for All, he \\"would keep the option of private insurance\\". He stated his goal was to \\"demonstrate to the American people that private insurance is not what [they] need\\" and that Medicare for All is \\"superior to [their] current insurance\\". He believed that such an approach will make holistic and preventive care more feasible. He also used to support free marriage counseling. His policy proposal does not contain a public option. HuffPost described it as \\"the most conservative health care plan in the Democratic Primary\\". He has stated that the doctor shortage can be attributed to inadequate investment in patient care technology and an overemphasis on medical careers that require individuals to go through medical school. Yang has proposed increasing funding for the suicide prevention efforts of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He supports the creation and funding of mindfulness programs in schools and correctional facilities. =Abortion= Yang is pro-choice. He supports \\"the right to privacy of American women\\" and the right for women \\"to choose in every circumstance and provide resources for planning and contraception\\". He has said that he would nominate pro-choice judges who \\"support a woman's right to choose\\". He also believes that UBI will reduce abortions being performed for financial reasons. =Circumcision= In March 2019, after an anonymous Twitter user asked Yang if he had an opinion on routine infant circumcision, Yang responded that he was against the practice. Yang later called himself \\"highly aligned with the intactivists\\" (\\"intactivists\\" referring to opponents of the practice) and stated that \\"history will prove them even more correct.\\" Yang called the evidence for circumcision being medically beneficial \\"shaky\\" and suggested that as president, he would support giving new parents more information about this decision. However, Yang did not support a ban on the practice and later clarified that he supported the ability of parents to make this choice for religious or cultural reasons. Intactivists described this position as incompatible with their movement, with Intact America's Georganne Chapin describing his statement as backtracking and suggesting that it was simply due to political pressure. Major politicians commenting on infant circumcision has been rare, with Yang being the only candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination to discuss the issue. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, himself an Orthodox Jew, disagreed with Yang's stance against circumcision. Yang invited him to talk further, and some outlets reported that Yang and Shapiro were going to have a public debate on the issue. However, Shapiro clarified that he and Yang were having a discussion rather than a debate and that their conversation would cover other issues rather than solely focusing on circumcision. Though white nationalists and anti-Semites also voiced agreement on online forums with Yang on his anti- circumcision stance, Yang rejected their support. =Corruption and bureaucracy= In a New York Times article about his campaign, several of Yang's policies about corruption and the federal bureaucracy are detailed, such as the creation of a \\"Department of the Attention Economy\\" that would focus on regulating the addictive nature of social media, the hiring of a White House Psychologist to focus on mental health issues, making Tax Day a national holiday, and, to stem corruption, increasing the salaries of federal regulators but limiting their private work after they leave public service. =Drug policy= Yang supports the legalization of cannabis and the decriminalization of opioids (including heroin) for personal use, but he does not support legalizing or decriminalizing cocaine. He cited the drug policy of Portugal, which he believes to be similar, as evidence of the potential effectiveness of his drug policy. If elected, he plans to pardon all prisoners serving sentences for low-level, non-violent marijuana offenses, and \\"would high five them on their way out of jail.\\" =Gun control= Yang supports \\"common sense licensing policy\\" for firearms, the restriction of the ability of people with a history of violence, domestic abuse, or violent mental illness to acquire firearms, and the grandfathering of current gun owners and the offering of a one-time \\"Good Gun Owner\\" tax credit. He also supports the prohibition of the manufacture and sale of assault weapons, bump stocks, suppressors, incendiary and explosive ammunition, and grenade launcher attachments, the implementation of a perpetual voluntary federal buyback program, and a tax credit for gun owners to upgrade their guns to personalized guns so children and teenagers do not potentially harm themselves or others with the gun. Yang supports law enforcement training that emphasizes the de- escalation of situations involving firearms. Yang has advocated for gun companies to \\"pay a fine when their product is used to kill an American\\" in order to realign incentives to deal with the problem of arms manufacturers' stocks going up after mass shootings. He supports \\"an increase in the availability of mental health resources\\". Yang calls the act of buying a gun and using it in a mass shooting \\"the last two steps\\" for a mass shooter and says we must also tackle the various steps that cause a shooter to buy and use a gun in a mass shooting in the first place. Yang has proposed ending active shooter drills in U.S. schools, or making them optional. He has argued that \\"the trauma and anxiety the process causes far outweigh the likelihood of a real-life shooting\\", citing a statistic that \\"the likelihood of a public school student being killed by a gunman is 'less than 1 in 614 million. He has also \\"criticized several school districts across the country which use theatrical recreations including firing blank rounds at students and using fake blood to imitate a real mass shooting\\". =Foreign policy= Yang supports American international alliances such as NATO. He has pledged to return the power to declare war to Congress if elected. He would also create a position for secretary of cybersecurity. In regard to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Yang wants a \\"two-state solution that allows both the Israeli and Palestinian people to have sovereign land and self-determination\\". He called Iran a \\"destabilizing force in the region\\", while also stating that leaving the JCPOA was a \\"strategic mistake\\", and he is opposed to engaging in an armed conflict with the country because it would have \\"no clear benefit for the American people\\". Yang has backed a more aggressive policy toward Russia, saying that \\"Russia is our biggest geopolitical threat, because they've been hacking our democracy successfully.\\" He wrote to the Council on Foreign Relations: > Russian aggression is a destabilizing force, and we must work with our > allies to project a strong and unified face against Russian expansionism ... > we need to expand sanctions against Russia, and Putin and members of his > government specifically through the Global Magnitsky Act, in order to > pressure the country to play by international rules. Yang also wants a \\"reset of the relationship with Saudi Arabia\\" due to the country's actions in Yemen and the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. =Higher education= Yang does not support making public colleges tuition-free, but does support investing in community colleges to drastically reduce their tuition. Yang proposed forgiving some student loan debt, improving efficacy of funds invested in education, and increasing the accountability of educational institutions. He supports affirmative action, believing that there has \\"never been a truly objective process\\" for college admissions, owing to \\"preference for legacies\\". He has said that he views the rising cost of tuition as one of the greatest issues facing higher education today. He identifies an increase in administration staff as the cause of the rising cost, and supports tying federal fund access to affordability and accessibility to curb the excess. Additionally, he is in favor of promoting vocational education and technical training as an alternative for college, saying \\"College is being over- prescribed in this country. ... Georgetown has estimated that there are 30 million good-paying jobs out there that don't require a college degree. Most require some type of specialized training.\\" =Immigration= Yang is a supporter of the DREAM Act, a bill that would protect migrants who entered the United States illegally as minors. He would create a new category of residency that would allow certain undocumented migrants to gain citizenship after 18 years in the country. He would implement new technology to secure the Mexico–United States border, and increase financial support for ports of entry and environmental protections around the Rio Grande. Yang claims that immigrants are being scapegoated for the problem of job displacement through automation, stating that \\"If you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants, you will find wall to wall robots and machines.\\" =LGBT rights= Yang has promised to enact legislation that prevents discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. He believes that \\"the protections of the Civil Rights Act should apply to LGBTQ+ Americans\\". =Time Banking= In his book that accompanied his presidential campaign Yang talks about implementing Time-based currency in addition to the already existing dollar. He recognizes that the UBI might be able to partially solve the financial backlash that might come with the automation of society but thinks his so called \\"time banking\\" might make it evven better and provide a solution for other issues caused by automation. He thinks that rewarding people for doing jobs that they like doing will cause people to both bring value to society and value themselves more. He wants to make a completely new currency instead of using the old one because it would remove the stigma wround it, which would bring two advantages according to yang. The first being that \\"1000\\" social credit coins sounds a lot better than their actual value (which would be lower by current market standards), the second being that people would not mind if you bragged with these because it showed you did well for society. = Miscellaneous policies = Yang has proposed to eliminate the penny, reasoning that pennies \\"are expensive, environmentally damaging, and cost businesses time\\". He also wants to extend daylight saving time all year, which, according to Yang, will decrease \\"traffic accidents, heart attacks, and crime\\" and increase \\"exercise and economic activity\\". Yang also believes that NCAA athletes should be paid, which will enable \\"college athletes to participate in the massive wealth creation they enable for their institutions\\". He supports legalizing online poker in all 50 states, the \\"first legitimate candidate\\" to do so according to Card Player. Yang also advocated for all police officers to be trained extensively in Brazilian Jiu- Jitsu, to a minimum rank of purple belt.https://jitsmagazine.com/florida- police-chief-starts-free-bjj-for-officers/ Endorsements Yang has received endorsements or explicit expressions of support from officials such as Steve Marchand, Mike Honda, and Teresa Keng, as well as individuals including Elon Musk, Casey Neistat, MC Jin, Anita Baker, Sam Altman, Tony Hsieh, James Felton Keith, Eliot Horowitz, Ethan Klein, Kirsten Lepore, Stephen Sean Ford, Greg Ellis, Marcellus Wiley, Simu Liu, Joe Wong, Daniel Negreanu, Faraz Jaka, Andy Stern, Tommy Chong, Dominique Wilkins, Eugene Gu, Bobby Kim, Mark Schultz, Adam22, Christina Hoff Sommers, Peter Boghossian, Lloyd Ahlquist, Ken Jeong, Steven Yeun, Chris Jericho, Penn Jillette, Dane DeHaan, Teri Hatcher, John Leguizamo, Ken Bone, and Dave Chappelle. Yang has received campaign donations from Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, actors Nicolas Cage and Noah Centineo, Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, and Internet personality Ryan Higa. Whoopi Goldberg has mentioned him several times on The View, saying that she loves his ideas.

Background Vermin Supreme is a perennial candidate who has run in several United States presidential primaries. Supreme has run in the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries, the 2008 Republican presidential primaries, and the 2012 and 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. After having announced plans in 2018 of running for the 2020 Libertarian Party presidential nomination, Supreme filed his candidacy with the FEC on June 26, 2019. According to FEC filings, he chose Desarae Lindsey as his campaign manager. He also chose Richard Manzo, budget committeeman in Goffstown, New Hampshire as his chief strategist. Supreme has described his campaign staff as including \\"about a dozen people around the country with the various state coordinators,\\" and his effort as \\"ultimately [his] first real campaign\\". Campaign Vermin Supreme appeared on Fox News' Watter's World on May 18, 2019 to discuss his campaign for the Libertarian nomination. In December 2019, Supreme selected Spike Cohen as his running mate. On January 11, 2020, Supreme won a non-binding presidential preference poll conducted internally by the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire, winning 26 out of 44 votes cast. The primary was tabulated using Bucklin voting. On the 3rd of March 2020, Supreme was declared the winner of the Massachusetts primary. On May 23, Supreme placed third on the party's final round of balloting. Supreme's former running-mate, Spike Cohen, went on to win the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nomination. =Satirical candidacy= Many have cited Vermin Supreme's presidential campaign as harmful to the credibility or image of the Libertarian Party. As Supreme told New Hampshire magazine, \\"It’s been a very interesting sell trying to convince the Libertarian Party that a serious party can take a joke candidate and get their 5% without being pegged as a joke party.\\" Spike Cohen, Supreme's running mate, remarked that their campaign is \\"perfectly serious\\". Explaining the campaign's message, Cohen said, \\"it's the system that's a joke and it treats us as a joke and it treats the idea of having more than two options as a joke. We're changing the punch line by trolling the system.\\" Supreme has said that, in contrast to his past runs for the presidency, he considers this campaign a \\"serious\\" bid.

It is derived mainly from scholarship by Vietnamese-American ethnographer Natalie Newton, who is, at present, the only Western scholar to have centred Vietnam's les as her subject of investigation. Her articles have been frequently cited as reference or point of entry to issues concerning Vietnamese queer communities. As a research topic, Vietnamese homosexualities have only recently garnered scholarly interest. A large majority of scholarship has been produced in the 2010s, not allowing much time for significant historical evolution or reinterpretations. Hence, besides Newton and a handful of other academics, scholarship on homosexuality and LGBT issues in Vietnam is limited. Consequently, research on the demographic subset of Vietnam's les is even rarer. However, the relative lack of sources might in fact productively and aptly explain the conditions of life and kinship for Vietnamese les. In fact, scholarly neglect mirrors, and can even be attributed to, the marginalization of les due to the intertwined, compounded discriminations against both women and homosexuality.UNDP and USAID, Being LGBT in Asia: Vietnam Country Report (Bangkok: UNDP, 2014), 38. In her writing, Newton echoes the observation that the lack of direct scholarship on Vietnamese les strongly suggests that their agential forms of self-identification and community formation obliquely eludes homophobic interpellations and institutions. Therefore, instead of focusing on global liberal structures and discourses that similarly attempt to interpellate, define, and identify les, such as gay marriage laws, LGBT rights in Vietnam, or NGO activity, this entry will focus on les personal identifications and kinship structures, and how they differ from definitions imposed on them by governing macro-structures. Governing Structures and Regimes=European Modernity= Nineteenth century European modernity, in the forms of French colonialism, European gender values, and medical discourses on sexology, has significantly impacted the present-day treatment of Vietnam's les. Further examination of the influence of these external regimes will provide useful historical insight and possible explanations for the current stigmatisation of female homosexuality in Vietnam. French colonialism influenced and imposed changes in Vietnamese socio-cultural norms, thus elucidating how and why Vietnamese gender values changed over time. Frank Proschan historically explores French colonial constructions of Vietnamese gender. Through his analysis of gendered and sexually ambiguous figures like the eunuch and effeminate boys, Proschan argues that “the colonials were confounded by the Vietnamese sex/gender system,” in which they perceived no distinguishable characteristics between men and women.Frank Proschan, “Eunuch Mandarins, Soldats Mamzelles, Effeminate Boys, and Graceless Women: French Colonial Constructions of Vietnamese Genders,” GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 8, No. 4 (2002): 436. To the French, the Vietnamese did not conform to European gendered idea(l)s and naturalized, normative behaviour that was properly attributed to the respective genders. According to French gender norms, “cultivated and civilized” women were expected to be “corseted and gowned,” creating a seductive hourglass figure indicative of sexual fecundity.Proschan, “Eunuch,” 442. In contrast, Vietnamese women were deemed to be lacking in femininity because of their squarish build and narrow hips. Furthermore, they dressed like men, undertook “the most difficult of masculine labours,” and had repulsive blackened teeth from chewing betel and smoking cigarettes.Proschan, “Eunuch,” 442, 444. Vietnamese men were, by comparison, seen as universally effeminate and lacking masculinity. By European standards, the Vietnamese were backwards and uncivilized people because of their indistinct and androgynous gender presentations. In his examination of historical perceptions of male and female homosexuality in Vietnam, Richard Tran also explores the impact of nineteenth-century European medical discourses on the development of Vietnamese sex and gender values. Through extensive archival analysis, Tran shows how male and female homosexuality in Vietnam was synonymous with gender-crossing, or more specifically, the transgression of heterosexual gender norms through the manifestation of physical or psychological attributes of the opposite gender. Male effeminacy and female masculinity are examples of gender-crossing. Tran argues that the figure of the 'gender-crosser' was constructed and pathologized by two factors: the Vietnamese state and late nineteenth-century European sexological discourses that permeated Vietnamese society during the period in question. This section will focus on the latter discourse. According to Tran, nineteenth-century European sexology was defined by two overarching lexica: anatomical and psychiatric. Both contributed to the solidification of ‘gender- crossing’ discourse, which was pervasive in France. In the first instance, medical scientists would “search the body for visible proof” of functioning sexual genitalia (or lack thereof).Richard Tran, “An Epistemology of Gender Historical Notes on the Homosexual Body in Contemporary Vietnam, 1986-2005,” Journal of Vietnamese Studies 9, No. 2 (Spring 2014): 11-12. Masculine women, effeminate men, and hermaphrodites were therefore deemed to have “blurred or indistinguishable” sexual features.Tran, “Epistemology,” 12. In psychiatric discourse, anatomical and physiognomic abnormalities were mapped onto psychological deviances. A popular psychiatric theory was inversion, which claimed that weak mental faculties gave rise to homosexual desires.Tran, “Epistemology,” 12-3. Together, these European medical regimes pathologized and invalidated homosexualities. Most importantly, both paradigms appeared frequently in Vietnamese historical sources, likely through French colonial transmission, contextualizing the current marginalisation of Vietnamese les and queer communities. As evidenced in Proschan and Tran's historical studies, European colonial, socio-cultural, and scientific modernity fundamentally altered gender norms in Vietnam. Prior to the arrival of European colonial modernity, “Vietnamese society did not show particular prejudice to people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identity.”UNDP and USAID, Vietnam, 11. For more details on the history of homosexuality in Vietnam from the 14th Century, see UNDP and USAID, Vietnam, 11-15, and Natalie Newton, “Homosexuality and transgenderism in Vietnam,” in Routledge Handbook of Sexuality Studies in East Asia, ed. Mark McLelland and Vera Mackie (New York: Routledge, 2014), 255, 264. In fact, sexual and gender pluralism in Vietnam was observed from as far back as the fourteenth century. In 1476, two women were even reportedly cohabiting and having sexual intercourse, with one of them miraculously becoming pregnant.UNDP and USAID, Vietnam, 12. The women were neither demonised nor criticized for their homosexual relationship. Following Proschan and Tran's arguments, it is therefore unsurprising that “the very first discussion of homosexual practice...as a sin [in Vietnam]” came from French colonial literature of the late nineteenth century.UNDP and USAID, Vietnam, 13. European condemnation of ‘alternative’ local gender and sexual practices was subsequently inherited by Vietnamese authorities, and have persisted until the present day. =The Vietnamese State= The state of Vietnam is another major institution that seeks, either directly or indirectly, to demarcate and delimit the lives of Vietnamese les and queer people. Likewise, a historical analysis of existing scholarship will uncover the controlling mechanisms of state and societal structures on Vietnam's queer communities. Notably, both Tran and Newton discuss the Social Evils Campaign launched by the Vietnamese state. According to Tran, the campaign was initiated in 1996. It claimed to manage and ban “serious social evils” like “drugs, prostitution and pornography.”Tran, “Epistemology,” 15. Spaces deemed to ‘promote’ these vices, such as karaoke bars and clubs, were raided and shut down. Tran also mentions the State's Cultured Family Program, introduced during the Renovation Era, that promoted a paradoxical “modern propriety” among Vietnamese women, encouraging “a return to traditional gender norms,” domesticity, nuclear family structure, and essentialist “feminine attributes.”Tran, “Epistemology,” 14. These state-driven campaigns thereby produced the gender-crosser as a foil: a deviant, dangerous figure that threatened Vietnamese cultural values and society. Like Tran, Newton argues that the Vietnamese state's social evils campaign “indirectly” targeted and regulated non-normative genders and sexualities.Newton, “Homosexuality,” 259. Although she agrees with Tran on the method and effects of such state- sanctioned campaigns, she differs in the campaign's chronological development. While Tran writes in the context of the mid-1990s, during Doi Moi, Newton claims that the State's social evils campaigns began “since the 1950s,” during Vietnam’s socialist era.Ibid. There are other minor inconsistencies in Tran and Newton's accounts of the same event. While both include drug use and prostitution as state-defined social evils, Newton additionally mentions gambling, while Tran includes pornography in the list of vices. Barring these minor discrepancies, what is most important to note is that while these campaigns did not directly target les or Vietnamese queer communities, coupled together, they sought to regulate the ideals of the body, gender and sexuality by promoting conventional gender roles and traditional family values. Furthermore, by punishing ‘alternative’ feminine embodiments and likening them to ‘evils’ through both campaigns, the State effectively warned against and curtailed the possibilities of being les in Vietnamese society. =The Vietnamese Media= The Vietnamese State also acts in collusion with other social structures like the media industry in order to spread an undesirable representation and reputation of les and queer people. Most notably, in 2002, the state-directed media in Vietnam declared homosexuality as a social evil, likening it to a moral pollutant, and broadcast calls for the “arrests of homosexual couples.”UNDP and USAID, Vietnam, 17. Consequently, there was an increase in police raids of LGBT establishments, and the community became further isolated. The media is therefore a powerful tool that influences popular opinion and perpetuates negative perceptions of les and homosexuality in Vietnam.Similarities can also be found in the Thai context. See Megan Sinnott, Toms and Dees: Transgender Identity and Female Same-sex Relationships in Thailand (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 2004), 193-4. Ethnographer Megan Sinnott notes how the Thai state-controlled print media portrays homosexuality as “a psychological abnormality that reflects [and causes] social and national ills.” Television programs were also ordered by state officials to stop screening images of kathoey, gays and lesbians, in order to stymie the ‘negative’ influence of gender and sexual deviance. Les are also presented as sexually reckless and “evading the responsibilities of proper and filial womanhood within a heteronormative family.”Newton, “Homosexuality,” 260. This depiction of sexual impulsiveness is achieved through the image of the “trendy les,” a hedonistic gold-digger who avoids the responsibilities of heterosexual marriage and child-bearing in favour of a “hyper-consumer lifestyle.”Ibid. In Vietnamese media, female (homo)sexual decadence is therefore portrayed through stories of les spending late nights in clubs and bars, exposed to the corrupting influence of drugs, prostitution, and gambling.Ibid. The undesirability of female homosexuality is hence likened to the excessive, greedy consumption of nightlife and social ills.For further similarities in media discrimination between Vietnam's les and the Thai context, see Sinnott, Toms, 188: Discussing the Thai print media, Sinnott notes how Thai newspapers have consistently “produced sensational stories of toms and dees [for over] twenty-five years,” likening them, and other homosexual groups like gays or kathoeys, to sexually decadent and morally corrupt individuals. Toms are the Thai equivalent of masculine ‘tomboys’, while dees, a label derived from the last syllable of ‘lady’, are their feminine partners. In Vietnamese print media from 1986-2005, Tran also notes how female homosexuality is likened to a “disease” and even “homicidal conduct.”Tran, “Epistemology,” 30-4. See also Paul Horton, “’I thought I was the only one’: The Misrecognition of LGBT Youth in Contemporary Vietnam,” Culture, Health & Sexuality 16, No. 8 (2014): 963-4: “In Vietnamese media, homosexuality has been portrayed as “a sexual deviation, a social evil, or a social disease.” The latter is often allegorized through the popular fictional detective-thriller genre. In a five-part column published in the Ho Chi Minh City's Police paper from December 1988 to August 1989, Ms. Ngoc Ha murders her ex-girlfriend in a fit of rage after she breaks up with her.Tran, “Epistemology,” 30-1. Recalling Tran's analysis of the ‘gender-crossing’ discourse around Vietnamese homosexualities, the author concludes that parents who dress their girls as boys and vice versa will result in them growing up to commit murder like Ms. Ngoc Ha.Tran, “Epistemology,” 31. Despite the predominant stigmatisation of les and queer people in Vietnamese media, there have been a few notable examples of more positive or nuanced media representations. These include the ground-breaking films Adrift (2009) and Lost in Paradise (2011) that deal with female and male homosexuality in Vietnam respectively.Horton, “Misrecognition,” 964. Effects of Structural Homo- and Les-phobia Negative and inaccurate representations of les and Vietnam's wider queer communities, perpetrated by overarching governing structures like the state, media, and colonial modernity, have tangible effects on body and mind. Most horrifyingly, les are often the tragic victims of homophobic “corrective” rape.Newton, “Homosexuality,” 260. Anti-LGBT violence, both physical and psychological, is also common in Vietnamese schools, causing up to 43% of targeted students to drop out.UNDP and USAID, Vietnam, 20. Both teachers and students are guilty of harassing and bullying LGBT students. Due to unsafe school environments, LGBT people are often denied educational prospects, consequently diminishing their chances of pursuing professional careers to make a living for themselves. The lack of educational and professional qualifications results in poverty and drives LGBT people to sex work, which, although perfectly viable as a profession, “further predisposes them to abuse, exploitation, and marginalization by society.”Ibid. Rejection from families is also common. Most Vietnamese families prioritize Confucian values and traditional gender roles and hence pressure their LGBT children to enter heterosexual marriages in order to preserve the honour and reputation of their family.Horton, “Misrecognition,” 965. See also UNDP and USAID, Vietnam, 20. For example, the family of a 20-year-old gay woman dissuaded her from her ‘lifestyle choices’ by emphasizing “the issue of face.”Horton, “Misrecognition,” 965. Those who do not conform to filial expectations are often kicked out of family homes, exacerbating impoverishment and homelessness among LGBT youth. Structural homophobia thus results in a vicious cycle of isolation and destitution for many Vietnamese LGBT people. This results in what ethnographer Paul Horton calls the ‘misrecognition’ of Vietnamese LGBT people, which causes them to feel alone, depressed, and even suicidal. Horton derived his thesis through extensive ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Hanoi with LGBT youth aged 20 to 25. According to Horton, and recalling earlier exegesis, misrecognition occurs in everyday contexts, such as the media, education system, families, and societal interactions. For his informants, the hegemonic heterosexuality in Vietnamese society causes them to feel “socially invisible”, unrecognised, and ostracised.Horton, “Misrecognition,” 962. A young woman confided that this overwhelming ‘normalcy’ made her feel “afraid” of her sexual difference.Horton, “Misrecognition,” 966. Horton shows how pervasive instances of misrecognition and stigmatisation result in a prevalence of suicide and mental health issues among Vietnam's les and queer youth, who feel alone, invisible, without a community to turn to for assistance or reprieve. One of Horton's informants morosely recounts how her friend committed suicide because she was unaware that there were support and community groups for lesbians in Hanoi.Horton, “Misrecognition,” 964. Horton's ethnographic approach therefore unearths and underscores the importance of community to Vietnamese les, for whom it is a literal lifeline. Les Personal Identification Before describing the politics and pragmatics of les community formation, exegesis on their personal, subjective identification is necessary. It is vital to acknowledge the legitimacy and agency of les self-identification in the face of derogatory slurs like o-moi, and over more widely and internationally common terms like ‘lesbian’ or ‘queer.’ Outside of Euro-American contexts, where the latter terms usually originate, local vernacular may have already taken precedence. Furthermore, in geopolitical contexts, women who have sexual or romantic relationships with other women may choose not to identify as lesbian for personal or political reasons. Others may appropriate or localize such terms to make it relevant to their respective social values. These strategies will be detailed in this section. In other words, “making “lesbian” a global category is problematic because it imposes the Eurocentric term “lesbian”” onto diverse communities who have very different sexual practices, standards, and realities.Evelyn Blackwood and Saskia E. Wieringa, “Introduction,” in Female Desires: Same-sex Relations and Transgender Practices Across Cultures, ed. Evelyn Blackwood and Saskia E. Wieringa (New York: Columbia University Press, 1999), 18-9. Globally circulating sexual identifiers therefore risk being reductive or generalizing the geopolitical and cultural specificities of gender and sexuality. Attention must also be given to gioi tinh, the local gender/sex construct that shapes les linguistic, subjective self- determination. Unlike globally translatable, and hence accessible, labels like ‘LGBT’ or ‘lesbian’, Newton writes that gioi tinh “is more complex than either “gender” or “sexual orientation,” and holds contradictory, “multiple meanings.”Natalie Newton, “A queer political economy of ‘community’: Gender, space, and the transnational politics of community for Vietnamese lesbians (les) in Saigon” (PhD diss., University of California, Irvine, 2012), 175-6. Moreover, its discrepancies and contestations are “not a problem of translation,” but “reflect a broader conceptual disjuncture between Western and Vietnamese conceptions of gender/sex,” where the former model cannot simply be mapped onto the latter.Newton, “Queer political,” 198. As Newton discovered through her fieldwork, gioi tinh is “a complex combination of both gender and sexuality,” comprising four categories that will be briefly introduced here.Newton, “Queer political,” 183-4. Firstly, gioi tinh can refer to “biological sex [male/female] or heteronormative social gender [man/woman].”Newton, “Queer political,” 184. Nam is used for men/males, and nu for women/females. Gioi tinh is most commonly used in this manner, “reflecting the rampant heterosexism of Vietnamese language and social norms.”Newton, “Queer political,” 186. Secondly, gioi tinh can refer to sexuality and sexual acts.Ibid. Thirdly, it can indicate sexual orientation, specifically heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual.Newton, “Queer political,” 188. Most importantly, les have also incorporated a “gender within gender” into gioi tinh, a fourth category to describe the unique vocabulary of their les gender.Newton, “Queer political,” 184. This subcultural category of subjective identification differs from other Southeast Asian gender/sex systems like the Thai phet. This category includes les genders: B, SB, and fem, which are modifications of “English terms “butch,” “soft butch,” and “femme.”Newton, “Queer political,” 192. See also Newton, “Homosexuality,” 263. For the uninitiated, the three terms can be thought of simply as a decreasing gradation from masculinity (B) to femininity (fem). There are also slight “modifiers to these three main genders,” such as hard B to describe a hyper- masculine personal identification.Newton, “Queer political,” 197. Interestingly, les differ from other female same-sex communities in Southeast Asia in terms of their personal identification. Most distinctly, Newton notes that her les informants identified their gioi tinh as nu (woman), and never as nam (man). However, other regional female same-sex subjects like the Thai tom (the local term for tomboy) are “more appropriately gendered as “men.”Newton, “Queer political,” 185. Transgender masculinities hence appear to be a more prevalent form of identification for other Southeast Asian female homosexual subjects than for les. Besides the toms of Thailand, the tombois of West Sumatra are also more appropriately identified as men. In her ethnographic fieldwork, during which she briefly dated a tomboi, Evelyn Blackwood realized that “tombois were not the Indonesian version of [the globally circulating category of] butches. They were men.”Evelyn Blackwood, “Tombois in West Sumatra: Constructing Masculinity and Erotic Desire,” Cultural Anthropology 13, No. 4 (Nov 1998): 496. Ethnographer Kale Bantigue Fajardo similarly argues how the seafaring Filipino tomboy, who works on itinerant ships, are not butch lesbians. Rather, their “female manhood” resembles transgender masculinities such as toms in Thailand and tombois in West Sumatra.Kale Bantigue Fajardo, “Transportation: Translating Filipino and Filipino American Tomboy Masculinities through Global Migration and Seafaring,” GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 14, No. 2-3 (2008): 407. Furthermore, by co-existing with heterosexual Filipino seamen in “purely men's spaces” like cockfights, Fajardo illustrates how transgender Filipino tomboy masculinities are capable of negotiating, reconceptualizing, and even participating in the former's dominant “watertight masculinities.”Fajardo, “Transportation,” 419. In contrast to the transgender masculinities in Southeast Asian contexts, Vietnam's les prefer to identify as female homosexuals. Les Community Formation Having foregrounded les subjective terms and systems of identification, it is equally vital to examine how these self-perceptions translate within a group or community dynamic. Most importantly, both individual and community identities are paramount in granting les agency and kinship in the face of stigmatisation and misrecognition by overarching structures of governance. Notably, Newton foregrounds les communities in Saigon in her scholarship, and specifically explores how the concept of ‘contingent invisibility’ is instrumental to their formation. To provide exegesis for her original theorization, Newton surveys existing literature on queer visibility and gendered space, but draws most importantly from ethnographic fieldwork that she conducted on Saigon's les community from 2006-10. Newton argues that, “in the face of social stigma” such as those imposed by the state, media, and external European influence, Saigonese les recognition and kinship are facilitated through a “strategic invisibility,” in which they are hidden in plain sight from governing and surveillance structures.Natalie Newton, “Contingent Invisibility: Space, Community, and Invisibility for Les in Saigon,” GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 22, No. 1 (January 2016): 110. Therefore, community formation among Saigon's les are ‘contingent’ on factors such as state legislations, personal relationships, and gender norms, and cannot be conceived of within the dichotomous binary of positive visibility and passive, negative invisibility. Instead of directly opposing or criticizing hegemonic structures like the state and media, Newton illustrates how les create a sense of community and validation by strategically navigating within social norms and structures and appropriating them for their benefit. For instance, although les might be considered a stigmatised minority in Vietnamese society, Newton shows how they are able to claim public space as their own. On Saigon's sidewalks, les are able to “pass” as heterosexual, and hence blend in with broader heteronormative society.Newton, “Contingent,” 121. Les gather in groups to chat or play games, and can disappear quickly and discretely should the police decide to disperse the crowds. Protected by their “individual anonymity” in crowded streets and public parks, les are able to appropriate public spaces in order to nurture communalism and social intimacies.Newton, “Contingent,” 123. Similarly, ethnographer Alison J. Murray notes how “covert lesbian activities are an adaptation” to negotiate around prevailing Islamic ideology in Indonesia.Alison J. Murray, “Let Them Take Ecstasy: Class and Jakarta Lesbians,” in Female Desires: Same-sex Relations and Transgender Practices Across Cultures, ed. Evelyn Blackwood and Saskia E. Wieringa (New York: Columbia University Press, 1999), 142. Like Vietnamese les, Indonesian lesbi (another locally preferred precedent to ‘lesbian’) avoid stigmatisation by adopting fluid sexual presentations in order to ‘pass’ as heterosexual males or females. However, Indonesian lesbi tactical kinship formations are created in response to frameworks of hegemonic religion, which, according to research material, is not a predominant concern for Vietnam's les. Strategies of anonymity and concealment are also evident in other examples of les community formation. For instance, Newton describes the numerous contingencies around Café Duyen, the single most important space for les sociality. Firstly, the café is located not on busy, accessible sidewalks, but rather in a secluded residential alleyway, with only a small, illegible sign that does not signal that it is a les-only space. Therefore, “knowledge of the café’s exact address is contingent on participation in the les world,” reflecting the owner's motivation to establish the café primarily for the les community, not for commercial profit.Newton, “Contingent,” 128-9. Secondly, “entrance to the café is contingent on one's ability to perform membership in the les community,” through their personal appearance, or by naming popular les web forums.Newton, “Contingent,” 129-30. As Newton demonstrates, les ably form convivial communities despite being herded by hegemonic governing structures. In fact, it is precisely these forces of stigmatisation and misrecognition that generate tactical, undetectable, thriving les communities. Conclusion: The Politics of (In)Visibility and \\"Come Out\\" Through her research, Newton therefore illustrates how idea(l)s of community formation and visibility are fundamentally different in Western and Vietnamese queer contexts. In Western neoliberal contexts, spatial occupation and public visibility are often straightforwardly linked to active “resistance” and progress for queer communities, while invisibility is perceived as a “deficiency,” lacking political intent.Newton, “Contingent,” 114. Such a myopic binarization might explain the pre-emptive, misinformed demonization of ‘Third World’ or ‘global South’ countries like Vietnam as being ‘backwards’ or ‘undeveloped’ due to their lack of visible or documented LGBT rights. However, as described in the previous section, Vietnam's les do not directly oppose governing structures or subscribe to a rights-based politics of visibility. Instead, they utilize strategies of contingent invisibility to productively adapt to and appropriate hegemonic systems in order to develop burgeoning communities, kinship, and personal agency. Vietnamese les politics of (in)visibility can also be acutely observed in their concept of “come out,” a local derivation of the global or Euro-American concept of “coming out”: a personal and politicized disclosure of one's homosexuality. During a birthday celebration in the les community, Newton and other les witnessed birthday girl Bay symbolically propose to her girlfriend on stage with extravagant jewellery while proclaiming her everlasting love for her partner. While some cheered on this ostentatious display of affection and wealth, others cautiously deemed it was “too much,” stating that a “true” les would never resort to such lurid, performative gestures.Newton, “Queer political,” 202, 204. In contrast to Western norms of “coming out,” in the Vietnamese context, “self-disclosure of one's sexuality is not necessarily the ultimate legitimization of les sexual subjectivity.”Newton, “Queer political,” 203-4. Paradoxically, it can actually undermine the authenticity of les subjectivity. Sinnott observes the “lack of resonance with the concept of “coming out” among Thailand's toms and dees, who never made public proclamations of their sexuality because they were “unnecessary and overly confrontational.”Megan Sinnott, “Dormitories and Other Queer Spaces: An Anthropology of Space, Gender, and the Visibility of Female Homoeroticism in Thailand,” Feminist Studies 39, No. 2 (2013): 342. Non- disclosure among female same-sex communities in Southeast Asia thereby underscores a transnational politics of gender and sexuality. Through their unique vocabulary of gendered identification and strategies of contingent invisibility, les in Vietnam elude the limitations and stigmatisations of governing structures like the state, media, and European modernity. Rather than engage in direct confrontation or opposition, their politics of (in)visibility allows them to nurture communities and personal identities on their own terms, beyond the pervasive heteronormativity of Vietnamese civil society.

While initially purchased en masse by a Russian collector, the works have since been added to the collections of the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow and the Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg.  History  In the 1867, Russian artist Vasily Vereshchagin (whom had recently finished studying painting in Paris) was informed that the Governor of Russian Turkestan, Konstantin von Kaufmann, required cartographers and painters for military service in Imperial Russia's Central Asian territories. Enticed by the freedom such a position would provide, Vereshchagin enlisted and was deployed to Samarkand in Turkestan, where a war had recently broken out between Russia and the Emirate of Bukhara. In the several years of intermittent fighting that followed, Vereshchagin was attached to the Russian army; he painted, and on occasion fought against the various nations that opposed Russian expansion into Central Asia. Per his role as a war artist, many of Vereshchagin's works depict battle scenes; however, the artist also produced (both during his military service and during a second trip after his service had ended) a number of ethnographic and landscape paintings depicting the scenery of Central Asia. Many of these paintings, though classified as orientalist, were realistic and relatively uncensored, a fact that was in stark contrast to the works of Vereshchagin's Russian contemporaries. As noted by one source, Vereshchagin's work exudes feelings of decline and decay; many scenes he painted feature death, and the artist often painted the ruins of once-great civilizations that had since gone into decline. As Vereshchagin himself noted, \\"My main purpose [was]…to describe the barbarism with which until now the entire way of life and order of Central Asia has been saturated.\\" Following his second trip to Turkestan in 1869, Vereshchagin (who was residing in Munich) began producing a series of paintings that would become known as his \\"Turkestan Series\\". These 13 works of art were painted between 1869 and 1872; some were imaginary pieces, but most were renderings of scenes that Vereshchagin had observed while in Turkestan. Upon the completion of his works, Vereshchagin chose to present his collection of paintings at the Crystal Palace in London, as Russia was at the time considered an artistic backwater. In Britain, his work was well-received. Upon his return to Russia, Vereshchagin's paintings were likewise well-received by the general public. However, his depiction of the brutal nature of the war and of the Russian war dead displeased some members of the Russian military, who saw the depiction of dead Russian soldiers as being defeatist and unpatriotic. Two of his works in particular, The Apotheosis of War and Left Behind, were singled out for criticism. Regardless, Vereshchagin was able to sell many of his paintings to a private buyer, Sergei Tretyakov. Upon Tretyakov's death in 1892, his collection of art, including the Turkestan Series, was donated to city of Moscow. From there, the paintings of the series were split between the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow and the Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg.

It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The series takes place after the events of the film Avengers: Endgame (2019). WandaVision was produced by Marvel Studios, with Schaeffer serving as head writer and Matt Shakman directing. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany reprise their roles as Wanda Maximoff and Vision, respectively, from the film series. Teyonah Parris, Kat Dennings, Randall Park, and Kathryn Hahn also star. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of limited series for Disney+, centered on supporting characters from the MCU films such as Maximoff and Vision, with Olsen and Bettany expected to return. Schaeffer was hired in January 2019, the series was officially announced that April, and Shakman joined in August. Filming began in Atlanta, Georgia in November 2019, before production was halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed that July in Los Angeles. WandaVision is scheduled to premiere in December 2020, and will consist of six episodes. It will be the first series in Phase Four of the MCU.  Synopsis  Set after the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), Wanda Maximoff and Vision begin to suspect things are not as they seem as the two live their ideal suburban life.  Cast and characters = Main = * Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch: An Avenger who can harness magic, engage in telepathy and telekinesis, and alter reality. Olsen said the series would explain how and why Maximoff becomes known as the Scarlet Witch, as she had not been called that in previous MCU appearances. * Paul Bettany as Vision: An android and Avenger created using the artificial intelligences J.A.R.V.I.S. and Ultron as well as the Mind Stone. Vision appears in the series after his death in Avengers: Infinity War (2018). * Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau: The daughter of Maria Rambeau, who is the best friend of Carol Danvers. A younger version played by Akira Akbar previously appeared in the film Captain Marvel (2019). * Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis: A political science major who is a friend of Thor. Dennings reprises her role from Thor (2011) and Thor: The Dark World (2013). * Randall Park as Jimmy Woo: An FBI agent. Park reprises his role from Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018). * Kathryn Hahn as Agnes: A \\"nosy neighbor\\". = Guest = * Fred Melamed as Arthur Heart: Wanda and Vision's neighbor. * Debra Jo Rupp as Mrs. Heart: Arthur's wife and Wanda and Vision's neighbor. Additionally, Asif Ali has been cast in an undisclosed role.  Episodes  Production = Development = By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for its parent company Disney's streaming service, Disney+, to be centered on supporting characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films who had not starred in their own films, such as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch. Actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series, including Elizabeth Olsen as Maximoff. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each, have a \\"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\\", and be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television (who produced previous MCU television series). Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was believed to be taking a \\"hands-on role\\" in each limited series' development, focusing on \\"continuity of story\\" with the films and \\"handling\\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films. By the end of October, Paul Bettany's Vision was expected to play a significant role in the series, which would focus on the relationship between Maximoff and Vision. In the following months, the titles Vision and the Scarlet Witch and The Vision and Scarlet Witch were both reported for the series. Jac Schaeffer was hired as head writer of the series in January 2019 after previously working as a writer on the films Captain Marvel (2019) and Black Widow (2021) for Marvel Studios. Schaeffer was set to write the pilot episode and executive produce the series. That April, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series with the title WandaVision. Later in the month, Olsen indicated parts of the series would be set in the 1950s. In August, Matt Shakman was hired to direct the miniseries, which consists of six episodes. Budgets for each episode were reported to be as much as $25 million. Feige described the series as part \\"classic sitcom\\", part \\"Marvel epic\\". Bettany called the series \\"super avant- garde and weird\\", while Olsen added that there were \\"plenty of comic books that support\\" the characters appearing in a sitcom setting. Olsen also indicated that there were ongoing discussions regarding whether the series would use a laugh track. = Writing = The series takes place after the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), and ties in to the Phase Four film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), in which Olsen reprises her role as Maximoff. Schaeffer hired eight writers for the series' writers room, including four women and several people of color because of her belief that \\"stories are better the more perspectives you have\\". Megan McDonnell served as a staff writer on the series, before being promoted to story editor. Schaeffer compared her work on the series to the film Black Widow, saying WandaVision would be \\"the polar opposite\\" to the film's style of aggressive, visceral action. Comic book writer Tom King indicated in October 2019 that his run on The Vision would be an inspiration for WandaVision. With the release of the series' official trailer, some commentators noted this influence as well as references to the \\"House of M\\" comic book storyline, The Vision and the Scarlet Witch by Bill Mantlo and Rick Leonardi, and The Vision and the Scarlet Witch by Steve Englehart and Richard Howell, in which Maximoff becomes pregnant by \\"magical means\\" with Vision. In December 2019, Feige described the series as an opportunity to tell the story of Maximoff and Vision, show more of what Wanda can do, further explore who Vision is, and introduce the comic book name \\"Scarlet Witch\\" to the MCU \\"in ways that are entirely fun, entirely funny, somewhat scary, and will have repercussions for the entire future of Phase Four of the MCU\\". = Casting = San Diego Comic-Con International With the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Olsen and Bettany would reprise their roles of Maximoff and Vision, respectively, in the series. Teyonah Parris was announced as cast in the role of Monica Rambeau in July 2019; the character was introduced to the MCU as a child (played by Akira Akbar) in Captain Marvel, which was set in 1995. The next month, Kat Dennings and Randall Park were set to reprise their MCU film roles as Darcy Lewis and Jimmy Woo, respectively, while Kathryn Hahn was also cast as Agnes. Dennings previously appeared in the Thor films, while Park joined the series following a general meeting with Marvel to discuss Woo's future in the MCU after his introduction in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018). Asif Ali was also cast in the series, which was revealed in October 2020. = Filming = Filming began in early November 2019, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with Shakman directing, and Jess Hall serving as cinematographer. The series is filmed under the working title Big Red. Filming was previously reported to begin on September 21 in Los Angeles, California. Location shooting took place in the Atlanta metropolitan area throughout the months of December 2019 and February 2020. A filming wrap party for the series occurred on March 1, but production for the series was still underway on March 14 when it was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming resumed in Los Angeles in July 2020. = Music = In January 2020, Christophe Beck announced that he would compose the music for the series; he previously wrote the scores for Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp.  Marketing  At Disney's biennial convention D23, a teaser for the series was shown that combined footage of Maximoff and Vision from previous MCU films with images from old sitcom television series The Dick Van Dyke Show and Father Knows Best. The series was promoted as part of Expanding the Universe, a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019. In December, Feige debuted the first image from the series at Comic Con Experience. Vinnie Mancuso of Collider found the image to be \\"very \\", highlighting the \\"old- school black and white\\" coloring. A commercial for the series and fellow Marvel Studios Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki, was shown during Super Bowl LIV. Inverses Dais Johnston noted that the clips shown visually referenced past sitcoms spanning different eras, including The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961–1966), Leave It to Beaver (1957–1963), Bewitched (1964–1972), The Brady Bunch (1969–1974), Roseanne (1988–1997), and Full House (1987–1995). Johnston thought the series would be \\"a must-see not only for Marvel fans but also for anyone looking for a hit of nostalgia: the era- spanning framework means anyone can relive the shows of their childhood in this age of streaming.\\" Julia Alexander of The Verge said the footage \\"wasn't much\\" but offered \\"enough glimpses to tease fans\\". Haleigh Foutch at Collider felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's teasers \\"stole the whole show\\" and had \\"a lot to get excited about\\". Foutch said the WandaVision footage was \\"the most exciting\\", saying it was \\"utterly strange and unpredictable looking\\". The series' official trailer was released on September 20, 2020, during the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards. The trailer received 55.7 million online views within 24 hours, including 36.1 million on YouTube, 4.9 million on Facebook, and 10.1 million on Instagram, which was believed to be the highest number ever for a streaming service's television series trailer. The views were also compared to those received by trailers released during the Super Bowl. WandaVision also had over 302,600 social mentions, trending on Twitter immediately after a teaser aired during the Emmy Awards ahead of the full trailer's release, ultimately trending fourth on Twitter; the trailer was the number two trending video on YouTube as well. Ethan Anderton from /Film said the footage in the trailer \\"looks like one of the most trippy Marvel projects to date\\". He also pointed out Vision wearing a Halloween costume version of the character's comic design as an indication there would be \\"more lighthearted stuff in this series too\\". Matt Patches at Polygon called the trailer \\"a hoot, full of bright colors and odd behavior\\", adding that it still left much of the series a mystery. Comic Book Resources Noah Dominguez said the trailer \\"offers quite a bit in terms of content\\" with \\"a vivid look at some of the visual tricks on display\\". Charles Pulliam-Moore of io9 called the trailer's use of \\"Twilight Time\\" by The Platters \\"the most haunting\\" of \\"all the strange things featured in\\" it. As well, he felt the trailer was edited to create \\"the effect of rapidly flipping through television channels in search of something good to watch\\", and pointed out how the static visuals when Wanda changed things around her made \\"it unclear whether what she's interacting with is real or not\\". Moore also said the last part of the trailer showing Teyonah Parris as the adult Monica Rambeau was the trailer's \\"money shot\\". The Hollywood Reporters Richard Newby described the trailer as \\"jam-packed with information\\" and felt that it \\"gives fans quite a lot to look forward to, as well as some mysteries to ponder over leading up to the premiere\\".  Release  WandaVision is expected to debut in December 2020 on Disney+, and will consist of six episodes. The series was originally set to be released in early 2021. It will be the first series in Phase Four of the MCU.

History  Bourton was recorded in the Domesday Book as Burtune. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the manor of Bourton was held by Wenlock Priory within the hundred of Patton. Early in the 12th century the hundred was merged with Culvestan to form the hundred of Munslow, but in 1198 Bourton was transferred with other manors held by the priory to the hundredal jurisdiction of the Liberty of Wenlock (also known as Wenlock Franchise). The principal court of the liberty met at Bourton, and the liberty outside the township of Much Wenlock was known as Bourton hundred by the 1220s. In 1468 Edward IV granted the men of Much Wenlock a charter forming the Borough of Wenlock. Over the years the borough asserted jurisdiction over the liberty of Wenlock, including the hundred of Bourton. From the early 18th century the hundred ceased to meet at Bourton. Bourton was confirmed as part of the borough in 1836, when the borough was reformed as a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The borough was reduced in size in 1889, but continued to include Bourton until it was abolished in 1966.

Derek Kolstad joined the series' writing team in July 2019, and said he would be bringing \\"a wink and a nod\\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise John Wick. Kolstad added that the series would explore reactions to a black man becoming Captain America. Spellman wanted to \\"go home\\" with the characters and let the actors show their skills rather than simply focus on action in the series. Stan said the series' tone is similar to that of the film Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), explaining that the series is \\"grounded and very much in the world as we know it\\".

The following month, Danny Ramirez was cast in \\"a pivotal role\\". = Filming = Filming began on October 31, 2019, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with Skogland directing. The series is filmed under the working title Tag Team. Mackie and Stan announced the official start of filming on November 4. Mackie compared filming the series to production on the MCU films, saying it felt like shooting a six-hour film that would then be cut up into individual episodes rather than filming one episode at a time. Location shooting took place in the Atlanta metropolitan area from November through February 2020. In mid-January 2020, filming was expected to take place in Arecibo, Puerto Rico for two weeks. However, because of earthquakes on the island, production was suspended. Reporting on this news, Deadline Hollywood stated that it was unclear if the location would still be used for filming. On March 3, the production was revealed to be moving to Prague, Czech Republic for three weeks until March 25, with filming in the city starting on March 6 and expected to continue until the week of March 16. However, filming for the series was halted on March 10 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and members of the production returned to Atlanta. Later in March, Stan confirmed that filming had not been completed, but planned to be once it was safe to do so. He estimated there \\"were probably at least two or three\\" more weeks of filming to complete. In early May, the Czech Republic allowed television and film productions to start up again immediately, as long as they followed newly issued hygienic guidelines for cast and crew members. In late June, the head of the film commission in the Czech Republic announced that cast and crew involved in film and TV productions would be exempt from the European Union travel ban on US citizens which would take effect on July 1. Production was also scheduled to resume at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in August. In early September, filming occurred at Atlantic Station, and by the end of the month VanCamp had finished filming her scenes. Filming resumed in Prague in October 2020.  Marketing  A short teaser for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was shown at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, featuring Brühl as Zemo, with the character wearing his traditional purple mask from the comics. Skogland traveled to Budapest, where Brühl was filming The Alienist: Angel of Darkness, to capture the footage. Concept art for the series featuring designs for the characters' costumes are included in Expanding the Universe, a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019. In December, Feige debuted the first images from the series at Comic Con Experience. Matt Goldberg of Collider described these as more grounded than fellow Disney+ series WandaVision, which was also promoted at the event, with a \\"standard spy thriller\\" look similar to the Captain America films that the title characters were introduced in. A commercial for the series, WandaVision, and Loki was shown during Super Bowl LIV. Julia Alexander of The Verge said the footage \\"wasn't much\\" but offered \\"enough glimpses to tease fans\\".

History  Regimental colour guard of Royal Thai Air Force cadets In 1950, the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) started recruiting officers who completed their training from other institutions to work in the air force. Over time, as the number of military operations increased, the air force saw a need to build an air force academy to specifically train new cadets. In the same year, the Directorate of Education and Training of the RTAF proposed to the commander for the creation of such an academy and this was approved by the cabinet on 14 November 1952. The academy was officially opened on 7 May 1953 as the Royal Thai Air Force Academy, with the first intake of 30 cadets. The academy was then moved to its current location on 24 June 1963 near Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base. In 2013, King Bhumibol Adulyadej renamed the academy as the Navaminda Kasatriyadhiraj Royal Thai Air Force Academy, in commemoration of the academy's 60th year. In 2017, Royal Thai Air Force proceeds to build a new Royal Air Force Academy at Muak Lek District, Saraburi Province with a budget of 5 billion baht due to the old location that is cramped. The new air force academy has its own airport to support the CT-4 training plane, able to connect with Wing 1 Nakhon Ratchasima, Wing 2 Lopburi and Wing 6 Don Mueang, as well as installing modern aviation equipment and technology to supports digital networking bypassing the environmental impact survey and comparative studies with leading international air academy overseas in order to produce quality military officers. The academy completed a construction in 2020 and open for teaching and learning in 2021.https://www.dailynews.co.th/politics/623667  Curriculum  * Bachelor of Engineering ** Electrical engineering ** Civil engineering ** Industrial engineering ** Mechanical engineering ** Aerospace engineering * Bachelor of Science ** Computer science ** Military and Aerospace Materials  Air Force Cadet Regiment, King's Guard  *1st Cadet Battalion, Air Cadet Regiment, King's Guard, Navaminda Kasatriyadhiraj Royal Thai Air Force Academy *2nd Cadet Battalion, Air Cadet Regiment, King's Guard, Navaminda Kasatriyadhiraj Royal Thai Air Force Academy *3rd Cadet Battalion, Air Cadet Regiment, King's Guard, Navaminda Kasatriyadhiraj Royal Thai Air Force Academy *4th Cadet Battalion, Air Cadet Regiment, King's Guard, Navaminda Kasatriyadhiraj Royal Thai Air Force Academy *5th Cadet Battalion, Air Cadet Regiment, King's Guard, Navaminda Kasatriyadhiraj Royal Thai Air Force Academy  See also  * Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy * Royal Thai Naval Academy * Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School * National Defence College of Thailand  References  This article incorporates material from the corresponding article in the Thai Wikipedia.

Career Church was nominated as a \\"writer\\" (record the details of accounting, managerial decisions, and activities related to the company) under the British East India Company at Fort Marlborough, Bencoolen (Bengkulu) on 17 April 1816 and started his duties in October 1816. During Church's stay in Bencoolen, he held several offices as Assistant to the Resident of Manna, Assistant to the Judge and Magistrate of Bencoolen and Registrar to the principal native Judicial Court. With the judicial experience gained during Church's stay in Bencoolen, it subsequently qualified him for important judicial duties as a member of the Straits Court of Judicature, Deputy Resident of Malacca, Accountant and Auditor at Penang, Deputy Collector, Military Paymaster and Acting Collector of Customs. In 1825, Church was a civil member of the \\"Eastern Settlements\\" which consisted of Prince of Wales' Island (Penang), Singapore and Malacca.

It won the Ridler Award at the 2003 Detroit Autorama.  Construction details  The chassis is custom-made by Larry Sergeff, with a wheelbase, more than stock. Andy Wallin built the engine, starting with a 1996 Corvette LT4 crate engine, with stainless steel headers, built by Steve Greninger, and mufflers from Stainless Steel Specialties. Greninger custom- built a cover for the fuel injection, and Karl Jonasson machined custom valve covers. It is mated to a TH700-R4 automatic transmission, controlled by a 1998 Camaro shifter, connected to rear axle (ratio 3.55:1) by an aluminum driveshaft provided by Empire Driveline. The Jack Mattson radiator uses a Vintage Air fan. The alternator is a 100 amp Powermaster. The IRS, based on a late-model Corvette, was carved from billet aluminum by Larry Sergeff, who also did the IFS. The shock absorbers are Carrera coilovers, the brakes in Wilwood discs, mated to a master cylinder from a 1994 Corvette. The steering box is from a Fiat. The car rides on a set of Foose's custom-designed polished five-spoke Nitrous Thrust knockoff wheels, one of only two sets to exist (the other used on his AMBR-winner, 0032), as \\"big'n'little\\"s: in front, in back, with Nitto tires (195/50 front, 255/50 rear0). The coupé's body is all steel (the hood sides aluminum). It has been slant-chopped (measured at the windshield posts) and pie-sectioned (measured at the front fenders), then fitting hidden hinges on the doors, which were lengthened The door mirrors and door handles were shaved, as were all the badges. The stainless steel grille, designed by Foose, was fabricated by Don Fink Metalworks. Jim Griffin, who also did Grand Master, Snyper, and the Smoothster, built and upholstered The Stallion; assisted by his son, James, he fabricated seats and covered them in two shades of tan leather, while the headliner is suede. The steering wheel is an piece from a 1950 Mercury, resized to . The Panasonic DVD player hides behind a Red Mountain Audio head unit. The dash had an aluminum insert, containing Classic Instruments gauges, while the interior rear view mirror came from Billet Specialties. The air conditioning system was supplied by Vintage Air. The exterior was painted in Glasurit's Sedona Fire paint by Chris Guinn, with final striping by Dennis Ricklefs. Foose used Mercury badging throughout, saying the coupé was the kind of car Mercury would have built, had the marque existed at the time.  History  Whiteside purchased the car in 1965 for US$150. It took the better part of two years for Whiteside to get the car road-worthy, before being forced to leave it the hands of his younger brothers, Randy and Steve, when he was drafted. The brothers drag raced the car; when Whiteside returned, he joined them, and the car was raced during 1972-75. After that, Whiteside parked the car until 1986, when he began rebuilding it, with the aid of Ken Garman and Don Maki (who later went to work with Foose). Over the course of two years, the car was rebuilt. During this process, Whiteside showed photographs of the project to Boyd Coddington, hoping his shop (Hot Rods by Boyd) could build a Ridler Award winner. It was through Coddington's shop Foose conceived a sister car, a roadster, which ultimately became Impact, after the bankruptcy of Coddington's Boyds Wheels, and the consequent failure of his rod shop. Foose took over the project, working out of his Orange and later Huntington Beach premises, aided by Roy Schmidt, Brian Fuller, Marcel DeLay (and his sons, Marc and Luc), Dennis Graff, Chris Guinn, Don Maki, Paco Castell, Chris Eddie, Tom Marcotte, Lance Nabors, Larry Sergeff, and Steve Greninger (many of them former Coddington employees). The car was completed in 2003, in time for the Autorama; Whiteside won the Ridler. Unlike many show-quality customs, this car is actually driven.

Henri IV de Sully (died 1336), Grand Butler of France, Treasurer of France, Lord of Sully was a 13th-14th century French noble.  Biography  Henri IV de Sully was the eldest son of Henri III de Sully and Marguerite de Bommiers. Sully was an adviser to King Philip IV of France at the end of his reign, and tutored Phillip's younger son Count Philip de Poitiers. In 1316, Sully supported the latter at his accession to the regency and the throne of France as King Philip V of France, and was rewarded by receiving the prestigious office of Grand Butler of France in 1317. In April 1317, he was captured by the Scots at the Battle of Old Byland. Sully played a key role in the administration of the kingdom by becoming Treasurer of France. He also played a key diplomatic role, participating in the reconciliation between Philip V and his cousin Robert, Count of Burgundy. In 1318, Sully was sent as an embassy to Pope John XXII. The same year, Sully was involved in a major dispute with Beraud de Mercœur, a royal adviser, whom Sully accused of treason. The king had to intervene to settle the quarrel between the two men. Philip V died on 3 January 1322. His brother Charles succeeded him as King Charles IV and replaced Sully as head of the Treasury with Pierre de Rémi. Sully was sent in 1323 as an ambassador to Westminster by Charles IV, to arrange the marriage of his daughter with the eldest son of the King Edward II of England. Sully appears to have found favour with Edward II and was appointed Seneschal of Gascony in 1325-26. In 1329, Sully was appointed by Philip III of Navarre as governor of the Kingdom of Navarre. During this appointment, Sully undertook diplomatic negotiations aiming to launch a crusade against the Kingdom of Granada, but the crusade did not eventuate.

He is the head of the division of infection and immunity at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) in Melbourne, where he specializes in researching the parasites that cause malaria. In 2019 he was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia for his \\"eminent service to the biological sciences\\". Education Cowman was awarded his Bachelor of Science (Honours) from Griffith University in 1979. After this, he earned his PhD at WEHI in 1984, with David Kemp as his supervisor. His PhD thesis involved the cattle parasite Babesia bovis: in conjunction with other students they developed cloning, immunochemical and recombinant DNA techniques to analyze the population variation and protein production, then to produce proteins and antigens. This was followed by two postdoctoral projects involving genetic analysis at WEHI. Cowman then moved to America to take up a postdoctoral position to study Drosophila at the University of California, Berkeley for two years. Career In 1986 Cowman returned to the WEHI, and decided to concentrate on genes that make parasites resistant to drugs. He was supported by a Wellcome Trust Australian Senior Research Fellowship in 1988, then by three successive International Research Scholarships from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In 1999 Cowman was appointed head of the Division of Infection and Immunity, which he still holds. Cowman held an Australia Fellowship from 2007 to 2012, and he held a Senior Principal Research Fellowship from the NHMRC. Cowman's research focus has been on protozoan infections, especially the cause of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum), which kill over 500,000 people each year world-wide. He made significant advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms which the malaria parasites use to take over human cells, and how they evade the body's natural defenses. Cowman found that once the malaria parasites takes over red blood cells, it remodels them in such a way that they can reproduce without triggering the patient's immune system. He also investigated how the parasites build resistance to antimalarial drugs. These two lines of research have helped to guide the development of new drugs, supplemented by his team's monitoring the spread of drug resistance strains. He also conducts research into the genetic properties of the parasite, and he was the first researcher to develop a live genetically attenuated vaccine of P. falciparum. Some critics have commented that the WEHI group struggled to come to grips with the financial necessities of commercializing their research and funding \\"big science\\" projects. However, their technical achievements were universally acknowledged. Cowman has published extensively, and his work very widely cited: Google Scholar cites his h-index as 108, while Scopus gives it as 91.

The son of Nicholas Ferrar the Elder, he was deputy governor and treasurer of the Virginia Company of London under Edwin Sandys.  Career  Ferrar was born on 2 December 1588, the third son of Mary Ferrar née Wodenoth and Nicholas Ferrar the Elder, Master of the Skinners' Guild of St Sithes Lane in London. John and his brother Nicholas were second only to the governor in their importance to the company; Peter Peckard describes him as Deputy Governor of the company, becoming king's councilor for the plantation. During the English Civil War, Ferrar gave refuge to Charles I against Cromwell's roundheads, but soon realised that his house was sufficiently well known to draw the parliamentarians' attentions. As such Ferrar escorted the king to Coppingford, where the latter spent the night before leaving for Stamford. John Ferrar and his brother were influential in the drafting of the\\"Great Charter\\" of 1618, which established self-governance in Virginia. = Virginia Company and Virginian self-governance = Ferrar was elected treasurer—effectively deputy governor—to Sir Edwin Sandys on 23 April 1619 and went on to play a significant role in the Virginia Company. He and his brother Nicholas were instrumental in the company's management, administration and preservation in the Americas. Charles. M Gayley believed that, \\"these Men and their fellow patriots were already, by the charters of 1609 [and] 1618, the founders of representative government in Virginia, and by the 1620 Charter of representative government in New England as well\\". The Virginia Company held its meetings at the house of Nicholas Ferrar the Elder, father of John and Nicholas, who was Master of the Skinners guild and one of the first shareholders in the Virginia Company of London. Sir Edwin Sandys, John Ferrar and his brother Nicholas made changes that resulted in the growth of the Virginia colony from 1,000 people in 1618 to over 2,200 in 1619. The years 1618-1619 are significant because they are the years of the \\"Great Charter\\", in which a set of instructions were given to the newly appointed Governor Sir George Yeardley. The birth of representative government in the United States can be traced from this “Great Charter” as it provided for self- governance from which the House of Burgesses and a General Council appointed by the Governor were created. On 24 July 1621 the treasurer, council and company of adventurers and planters for the Virginia Company of London passed an Ordinance and Constitution that codified the instructions sent in 1619. Little is known of this John Ferrar other than in the numerous documents of the Virginia Company and the Ferrar papers. \\"Between 1619 and 1622, factions developed within the company as a result of the administration of Samuel Argall deputy governor of the colony. Argall's exploitation of the lands and the trade of the company for private benefit; led to the formation of an administration under Lord Cavendish, John Ferrar, Nicholas Ferrar, Sir Edwin Sandys, Treasurer and Earl of Southampton .. The Sandys-Southampton party supported the parliamentary opposition in England, and thus the king and Sandys became bitter political rivals.\\" The Parliamentarian faction of the company blamed John Ferrar for the financial problems of the company caused by Edwin Sandys. On 24 May 1624, the company was dissolved, terminating in bankruptcy, and on 15 July, a commission was appointed to replace the Virginia Company of London and establish the first royal colony in America. However the representative government, the House of Burgesses, that resulted from the first and second charters remained in place. Ferrar wrote a full-length life of his brother Nicholas, which was never, however, published, and only part of which survives in a copy made by the 17th-century antiquarian, Thomas Baker. Ferrer died on 28 December 1657; a brass plaque commemorating him is in St John's Church, Little Gidding.'Parishes: Little Gidding', in A History of the County of Huntingdon: Volume III, ed. W.

The 1st Army was formed twice. The first formation was between the beginning of March 1918 and May as a reaction to the Austro-German occupation of Ukraine. The second formation was created on June 19, 1918, as a part of the Eastern Front and from August 15, 1919 as a part of the Turkestan Front. The Army was disbanded in January 1921. History On March 17, 1918, the Second All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets decided to create armed forces to counter foreign and contra-revolutionary forces. Five armies of some 3.000 -3.500 men were created. In fact, these armies were only brigades with limited combat capabilities. Asiyev became the commander of the 1st Army, which was stationed near Podilsk and counted some 30.000 men shortly before it was disbanded. In March 1918, there were some skirmishes with German troops near Odessa, but the army was forced to retreat to Taganrog and Rostov-on-Don. On June 19, 1918 the 1st Army was created a second time from the detachments and units acting in the Syzran - Simbirsk area against Czechoslovak and White Guards troops. During the Civil War, Saransk was one of the centers of formation of military units of the Red Army and the mobilization Department of the 1st Army operated in that city. In 1918, the 1st Army waged hostilities in the Volga region against the White Guards and the Czechoslovak Corps. It participated in the offensive of the Eastern Front 1918-1919, and led the attack in the Simbirsk and Syzran-Samara combat operations. The 1st Army took Samara (September- October 1918), Sterlitamak (December 1918) and Orenburg (January 1919). In the spring of 1919 during the Spring Offensive of the White Russian Army it held defensive positions in the Sterlitamak and Orenburg area. In April-June 1919, the Army participated in the Counteroffensive of the Eastern front and waged fights against the forces of Alexander Kolchak's Southern Army, conducting an offensive in the Buguruslan and Belebey operations. In August-September 1919, she operated as a part of the Turkestan Front, participating in the defeat of Alexander Kolchak's Southern Army and the Ural Army. During the Aktyubinsk operation, the 1st Army connected on September 13 with the troops of the Turkestan Soviet Republic in the Mugodzhar Hills. Part of the troops of the 1st Army continued to fight against the Ural Army in the Ural region until April 1920, while another part of the troops participated in the Khiva and Bukhara operations in November 1919-March 1920, establishing Soviet power there by occupying the whole region. The army was later also involved in the suppression of the Basmachi movement.

Background=Origin= This branch of music was generated from the yellow music in Vietnam. Yellow music (nhac vang) refers to music produced in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, named in opposition to “red music” (nhac do) endorsed by the socialist government of North Vietnam during the era of the Vietnamese War. Oftentimes, yellow music is also referred to like new music (tan nhac), or sugary music (nhac sen). These terms are reserved for songs that could be considered as popular music, opposed to ritual (like cau van), classical or folk music.Nguyen, M. (2012). Love is yellow in Vietnamese popular music. ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 1-66. Most yellow music has been associated with the bolero genre. The term continues to be used by Communist officials in Vietnam to describe songs that they find too sentimental, for example, love songs, that “lead people into a state of suffering over love, the opposite of the ideal happiness that people expect to find in it.”To V. (1976). Nhac vang la gi? [What is yellow music?]. Van hoa nghe thuat [Culture and Art], 5, p. 45 For Communist revolutionaries, the term “yellow music” has always had a pejorative meaning. However, some music sellers in Saigon, used it as a positive term, stamping “yellow music” on their tape and records to identify the sentimental music they were peddling.To, 1976, p. 43 Pre-1975 modern music in Vietnam Vietnamese modern music (tan nhac) began with the French arrival in the early 19th century. Initial French music came through the church and then the military right after their colonization of Hanoi in 1873.Gibbs, J. (1998) Nhac Tien Chien: The origins of Vietnamese popular song. Things Asian. The new French disseminations of popular songs were made even more popular by talking movies and ballroom dancing. Young people particularly found the new style of music attractive.Gibbs, J. (1996). A musical instrument workshop in Hanoi. Experimental Musical Instruments, 12(1). Primary musical activities in Hanoi before the 1930s included traditional theatre, reformed theatre, and songs by beggars who performed near train and bus stations.Gibbs, 1996 By the mid-1930s, Vietnamese started to compose songs in their native language using French melodies. The lyrics usually quite different from the French versions, but it became prevailing among the people in Vietnam. Later, the Vietnamese began to write their own songs as well. It is thought that the modern Vietnamese song originated from one of these early composers, Nguyen Van Tuyen, a native student of Huế at the Philharmonic Society of Saigon, who first performed his songs there in 1937. By 1938, he was also touring in Hanoi and other cities with great reviews.Gibbs, 1998 There were a number of Vietnamese composers and singers who were inspired to follow the French styles. From that on, pre-war music was developed, which is still widely listened by Vietnamese today.Nguyen, D. T. & Bandara, J. S. (1996). Emigration pressure and structural change: Viet Nam. UNDP Technical Support Services. Bangkok: Griffith University & Queensland: Australia Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific. The form of music included marching songs, love songs as well as songs about resistance and independence from France. Generally speaking, musicians and performers in particular often held low status in Vietnamese society.Valverde, K. L. C. (2003). Making Vietnamese music transnational: Sounds of home, resistance and change. Amerasia Journal, 29(1), 29-49. Although pre-war music supposedly ended by 1946 or 1947, some songs were written as late as 1954 are still attributed to this genre. The legacy of music is that it is still heard on the stages across Vietnam and even the United States some decades later. =Vietnamese modern history of diaspora= A fair number of Vietnamese people left their homeland before the 20th century. The largest exodus came with the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, when 125,000 Vietnamese fled South Vietnam; by 1999, approximately 1.75 million Vietnamese resettled in Eastern and Western countries. The U.S. took 900,000 Vietnamese migrants while Canada, Australia and France accepted over 500,000.Valverde, K. L. C. (2002). Making transnational Viet Nam: Vietnamese American community-Viet Nam linkages through money, music and modems. Vietnamese music. ProQuest Information and Learning Company, 1-338. Moreover, 250,000 Vietnamese were permanently settled in China and another 100,000 left for other countries. At the end of 2000, there were approximately 2.7 million Vietnamese living in more than 100 countries and territories worldwide, including more than one million in the United States.Ho Chi Minh City sees investment rush by overseas Vietnamese. (2000). Viet Nam News Agency. The global Vietnamese diasporic population numbered approximately 500,000 in 1975. This number increased to about one million in 1990 and two million in 2000. Because the Vietnamese market has been relatively small, the sales of Vietnamese overseas music were much less than the mainstream in the industry. As ethnic minorities, it is considered the sale of recording for 15,000 units as a success.Valverde, 2002 However, when the market was more mature, profits were counted in millions and allowed to employ a large number of performers, composers and producers. By 1995, over 30 music record companies occupied the most area of Westminster and Garden Grove, California known as “Little Saigon”.Marosi, R. (August 8, 2000). Vietnam's musical invasion; the popularity of new songs from the homeland has widened a political and cultural EH vide between young people and older generations who see it as mere propaganda. Los Angeles Times. alt=LittleSaigonsign.jpg The fall of Saigon The Fall of Saigon, or the Liberation of Saigon, was the capture of Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, by the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (also known as the Viet Cong) on 30 April 1975. The event marked the end of the Vietnam War and the start of a transition period to the formal reunification of Vietnam into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Starting from 1975, popular music in South Vietnam, known as yellow music, was prohibited by the new socialist government, with those caught listening to it punished, and their music confiscated, due to the belief that it contained “ideas that were not good, not healthy, that required criticism.” To, 1976, p. 44 In the circumstance, some artists in the music industry, such as Trinh Cong Son, kept staying in Vietnam, while others decided to leave, such as Pham Duy. The departure of many artists from Vietnam in May 1975 was the start point of Vietnamese exile music. Following the migration, yellow music has been modified for adapting to the foreign context. Therefore, its nature has been transformed, and it has developed towards music pertained to the diaspora, which still retains certain characteristics inherited from its original culture, that can be discovered from the themes of music, as a mean to show the attention of diasporic Vietnamese to their country of origin (See Appendix 1 and 2 for themes and links of songs). 20th Century: In Diaspora=Overseas Vietnamese artists= Among exiled Vietnamese composers, Pham Duy remained the best-known composer. His songs written before 1975 represent 90% of cassettes and CDs produced abroad.Tran, Q. H (2001). Vietnamese music in exile since 1975 and musical life in Vietnam since perestroika. The World of Music 43(2), 103-112. All singers have had at least one song written by Pham Duy in their repertoire. His songs, written since 1978 on the situation of exile and on life deprived of freedom in Vietnam, have received a good response. Since 1985 he has composed less but rather has written Vietnamese lyrics for western pop songs. In the year of 2000, he was allowed to return to Vietnam for one month to see his native country for the first time after 25 years of exile. Pham Duy performing in Ho Chi Minh City On the other hand, a new generation of young composers has been born abroad. For example, in the United States, Nguyet Anh (known only since 1980), Viet Dzung, Chau Dinh An, Phan Kien, Huynh Cong Anh, and Khuc Lan all belong to the Hung Ca movement. They have written songs on themes of struggle and resistance: Duy Quang on problems of exile; Le Uyen Phuong on boat people; Ha Thuc Sinh on penitentiary conditions in Vietnam; and Due Huy on love.Tran, 2001 Together, they have all written thousands of new songs on present problems, on their aspirations, on the resistance. Many musicians have continued to work thanks to official receptions, tours, and recordings on cassettes (until 1988), then on CDs (since 1990) and laser discs (for karaoke since 1995) and DVDs (since 1999). Pop groups known in Saigon, such as CBC, Dreamers (children of the composer Pham Duy), Up Tight (children of the musician Lu Lien), Crazy Dogs (children of the actor Viet Hung), Family Love in the United States, and Blue Jet in France continued to play abroad until 1990. New pop groups have been formed by young musicians to answer the needs of cabarets and dances held for Vietnamese in the United States, France, Canada, and Australia. Among singers known in Vietnam, Khanh Ly, who was best known for her frequent cooperation with a famous Vietnamese composer Trinh Cong Son, continued to be a Vietnamese idol of popular songs among the Vietnamese community abroad despite less publications of CDs, cassettes, and videos since 1995. She frequently gave performances, presenting on the market of music until 1995. Khanh Ly has appeared on many stages in countries where the exiled Vietnamese live. Few new compositions were included in the repertoire of singers, maybe because the old pieces encouraged the exiled Vietnamese to go through their hardship of life. Moreover, several productions houses have appeared in the United States and publish a great number of cassettes and CDs. There have been three big houses of productions, Paris By Night Thuy Nga Productions (PBN), Trung Tam Asia and Kim Loi. Some of the early music producers in the United States owned music businesses in Viet Nam before the fall of Saigon. For example, Tung Giang who produced works by famous singers like Khanh Ha and Khanh Ly continued with his work when he arrived in the United States. He was able to record on 16 track, which was an improvement from the 4 track available in Vietnam. The early years of resettlement music served as a time of preservation since the objective at this time was to make quality copies of pre-1975 music. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, those with experience in the music industry of Vietnam redeveloped their business in the U.S. One strategy to increase their market via merging other small music companies. In this period, Thuy Nga Productions made their branch in France. When living in Viet Nam, they had access to a studio owned by Thuy Nga. Once being rooted in France, Thuy Nga's husband, Mr To Van Lai, a former professor in Viet Nam, participated in the building of their first music house. With a better sense of the diasporic market, Lai created a division of Thuy Nga called Paris By Night, which produced videos of Vietnamese diasporic shows. =Post-1975 Vietnamese diasporic music in the United States= At the beginning of the 1975 migration, the generation of refugees from Vietnam was concerned about adapting to their host country, and so did musicians. However, it did not take a long time for Vietnamese music to spread throughout the newly built Vietnamese American community. Music at this time had more meaning than just entertainment that it functioned as a carrier of emotion for Vietnamese refugees to miss their motherland. Such a suddenly forced migration made most of them leave home without too many belongings. Few of them have brought cultural products. Therefore, in the early years, those with music products such as records and tapes, exchanged with others in the community to bargain for other resources; and by 1980, there were individuals who had collected a certain amount of Vietnamese music tapes. In the first decade that Vietnamese migrants had arrived in the United States, pre-1975 music was the most common type of music in the Vietnamese American community. Even more years later, the common musical themes of nostalgia, resistance and memory (See Appendix 1) conducted by Vietnamese composers continued to capture a large market. The songs that had been popular in the entertainments venues of Saigon during the Vietnamese War, were still being heard in coffee shops and nightclubs and sold in music stores. Videos on Vietnamese songs have been somewhat successful since the end of the 1980s. Large-scaled musical shows have been processed since 1986, and some of them have been organized to raise money for helping another group of diasporic Vietnamese, “boat people”, or to help local Vietnamese in distress in their home country. Thuy Nga Production's first series of music videos might represent the success. Thuy Nga's 1988 “The Giot Nuoc Mat Cho Viet Nam [A Tear for Vietnam]” song selection, which was visualized to reflect some melancholic characteristics, and typify those hot exiled music themes. With the appearance of music videos, many pre-1975 songs, as well as newly composed exiled songs, were accompanied by visuals. Meanwhile, various forms of Western popular music and also songs made by overseas Vietnamese composers were welcomed by the diasporic population. Post-1975 exiled music was about life in former South Vietnam, which included songs about love, homesickness, freedom and anti-communism. In the early years, many cultural patriots in diaspora tended to insist on a strong anti- communist attitude; individuals who were recognized to fall out of their group would be pressured to take an anti-communist viewpoint. However, some other people in the community or music industry did not have such strong anti- communist points of view; for them, music to some extent existed beyond politics. As long as they found the music was appealing, and the artists were able to attract the audience, the music would be promoted then. Western- styled influences As mentioned, French music greatly influenced the style of early Vietnamese popular music. Vietnamese composers gradually developed a way to innovate popular music by combining a variety of foreign and domestic elements. For instance, the famous Vietnamese composer, Van Cao, has blended Vietnamese traditional cultures, such as folk music, legends, and popular sayings with French chansons. Other well-known composers, such as Pham Duy, sought external inspirations from the American context. Pham Duy transformed Vietnamese poetry to become lyrics, as well as recreated western melodies to be Vietnamese songs.Gerke, F. & Bui T. (1999). Popular music in Vietnam. HKW. In his songs, he also kept on depicting the living of refugees in the United States after 1975. His equivalent counterpart in Vietnam is probably Trinh Cong Son, a milestone composer in the Vietnamese music industry, who was keen on the theme of love and peace, alerting the unified Vietnam government. Besides composers, singers maintained their numbers of loyal fans even when both of them lived outside Vietnam, such as Khanh Ly, Phuong Dung, Thanh Thuy and Le Thu; in Vietnam, Elvis Phuong, Tuan Ngoc and Due Huy sang and performed Vietnamese, French and American songs with their own rock bands. These three artists continued their successful careers after leaving Vietnam in 1975.Gerke, 1999 In addition to their indigenous popular music, Vietnamese also listened to Western popular music at that time. From the 1960s to 1970s, representatives of Western pop music in the market of Vietnam included the French singer Christophe, and American rock icons such as Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Rolling Stones. American music reached the peak of its influence in South Vietnam. During the American presence, not only the production of music but also broadcast stations have been influenced by the American rock and roll music, to which young people in Saigon preferred to listen. Moreover, the city was full of bars that often played music from the U.S.Nguyen & Bandara, 1996 Even the Vietnamese music within the country experienced such great influences from French and American music, Vietnamese exiled music was considered to take more adoptions. Both of them have been westernized mainly in three aspects:Tran, V. K. (1987). Tradition and innovation of Vietnamese music. Huangzhong-Journal of Wuhan Music Conservatory, 03, 83-85. the use of Western instruments (or remoulding traditional ones to be electric), westernized changes of musical language (including more various notes in compositions, or Western musical elements, such as Waltz), and westernized ways of performing (including more vocal layers, and Western singing techniques instead of \\"donot\\", a Vietnamese traditional vocal technique). Musical life in the United States There is a transitional period in the early musical life of diasporic Vietnamese. In the beginning, “... most of the old artists who left Vietnam were still trying to resettle in their new homes, so they had little time to produce any new music. In the U.S, there is more stress. [As an artist] You only work only 2-3 days a week. You work as a technician or something else [to supplement your income]”;Valverde, K. L. C. (Interviewer) & Tuan, N. (Interviewee). (July 10, 2001). Vietnamese American male singer. after the period of hardship, “even musicians starting out were able to have an affordable mini-studio in their own home. They can lay tracks and create music at their leisure.” In regard to Vietnamese music productions in the diaspora, Vietnamese Americans were playing a leading role in the domain. Their music industry, by living in one of the most wealthy and technologically advanced countries in the world, has been developed to adopt the best producing technology. Able to liberally learn and experiment in the techniques of arranging, they have been years ahead of their Vietnamese counterparts, since Vietnam's music industry has very limited access to such equipment and training. However, the spending on producing music was quite large, especially in the United States. For this reason, many Vietnamese Americans chose to produce their music or videos in Vietnam. Vietnamese diasporic music has penetrated into different markets. Led by enthusiastic individuals with the assistance of technological advances, members of the overseas Vietnamese population have successfully promoted their music to the world. Diasporic music as a special mixture of emotions has appealed not only the exiled Vietnamese but also residents in Vietnam. Diasporic music got a large number of fans in the homeland in spite of the fact that overseas music has been restricted especially in the public by the unified Vietnam government since 1975. With the eventual loosening of restrictions on music production, most notably since 1996, Vietnam has been emerging to create its own popular music centre. “Culture in a bubble” Things connected to the pre-1975 period were seen as an essential piece of cultural memory. Even some diasporic songs composed after 1975, inherited the pre-1975 standards. This static nature has allowed some to consider Vietnamese music production as “culture in a bubble”. For the younger Vietnamese generations, those who were mainly raised or born overseas, listening to melancholy music is even less appealing. They like other young people have attracted to popular music heard in the mainstream or at least those in the Vietnamese American music scene. Considering the current nature of Vietnamese diasporic music, the old generation in diaspora worried about its future and the trend of being assimilated. Some predict that Vietnamese diasporic music will die within one or two generations as the young forget the language and culture of Vietnam. Others feel that as long as diasporic Vietnamese are seen as the “other” in their host countries, they will find their way back to Vietnamese culture, and music is one road to take. The sad thing is that: “our children and grandchildren will be as good as the American musicians. But they will not be interested in writing for the Vietnamese American audience because the market is too small. The hope lies in Vietnam's [artists], but they are not creating either”.Valverde, 2002, p. 171 For people living in Vietnam, they can catch up with all the changes in the music of this country; but for people living abroad, they only remember the music of the period when they left.Valverde, K. L. C. (Interviewer) & Hong, N. (Interviewee). (September 17, 2002). Vietnamese female singer. Anti-communist pressures also prevent individuals from creating pieces in freedom. These factors threaten the future of Vietnamese diasporic music, or cause to the burst of the “cultural bubble.” 20th Century: In Vietnam=Post-1975 restrictions and resistances in Vietnam= The new leadership banned songs that were popular in South Vietnam after the war. Though exerting heavy control, the government could not monitor all its citizens. Vietnamese inhabitants had access to music that heard in the Vietnamese communities abroad in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The ban on exiled music and yellow music was more strictly supervised in the South, while people in the North accessed to them relatively more easily.Valverde, K. L. C. (Interviewer) & Nguyen, T. D. (Interviewee). (January 31, 2001). Vietnamese Journalist for Tuoi Tre newspapers and cultural critic. Paris By Night products were extremely popular and were enjoyed at very low volumes, at homes or covertly in some karaoke bars. In Hanoi, people would go to small video shops in the corners of town to look for PBN videos. From the late 1970s on, residents in Saigon who were captivated by Vietnamese diasporic music, had their relatives to send music recordings back to Vietnam.Valverde, 2001 By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Vietnamese citizens had already acquired pirated PBN videos, other tapes and CDs from the overseas Vietnamese community in the black market. They were able to follow the consumer trends in this way, including illegal music acquisitions.Black market is a seed of trade to come. (August 5, 1990). San Jose Mercury News, 1A. Although the government attempted to stop black market trading and purchases of foreign products in dark through nation-wide campaigns, people still watched them openly in 1993. The period from 1980-1990 was when Vietnamese exiled music had the greatest reception among the domestic audience. A very large portion of the population in the country was listening to music produced by Vietnamese in the diaspora. With the help of the Committee for Overseas Vietnamese, several diasporic singers were allowed to perform regularly in Vietnam, and even be billed side by side with Vietnamese singers.Valverde, K. L. C. (Interviewer) & Thanh, T. (Interviewee). (February 9, 2001). Vietnamese music, female producer. Against prohibition, people in North Vietnam also enjoyed Vietnamese diasporic music. The interesting thing is that the Northerners listened to the type of music even more than the Southerners because of its novelty to them; this way of singing is more expressive, soft, and sentimental than that of which they were trained traditionally. However, the favour of the music declined with the growing popularity of local substitutes. In the late 1990s, CDs made in Vietnam, such as My Linh and Toe Ngan, hit its domestic market as well as the overseas by storm. The music from this moment reaches Vietnamese living outside of Vietnam, signalling the phenomenon of “Vietnam's music invasion.”Marosi, 2000 Interestingly, more diasporic Vietnamese singers were brave enough to return to their adoring fans in Vietnam, bearing being labelled as a communist by the overseas community. Doi moi: anti-“social evils” campaigns Doi Moi is the name given to the economic reforms initiated in Vietnamese in 1986 with the goal of creating a “socialist- oriented market economy”. Some expected the nature of reforms might bring a more relaxing atmosphere for the general Vietnamese population to welcome Western and diasporic music. However, the Vietnamese government carried out a set of crackdowns on the circulation of the products. One example is the anti-”social evils” campaigns that were set up to stop western and diasporic influences in Vietnam. Such “social evils” include drug abuse, prostitution, gambling, drinking, decadent culture and having Western consumer values.Barr, C. W. (September 24, 1997). Vietnam's new wan “social evils”. The Christian Science Monitor Wednesday Edition. In 1996, in the months before the National Assembly meetings that take place every five years, Hanoi experienced the anti-”social evils” campaign. Foreign lettering on billboards were covered up; the major Coca-Cola helium blow-up outside of Hanoi was also shrouded; music and video shops were raided, and foreign-made products confiscated.Barr, 1997 Local bars and dance clubs were raided as well. Riot police rushed into an expatriate bar pushing everyone out onto the street well before the establishment was to close down for the evening. Similarly, reports show that officers raided bars and arrested suspected sex workers and fining bar owners in Saigon. In the same year, music and video stores ran their business in the margin. In 1997, police in Ho Chi Minh City claimed they burned 15 tons of banned compact discs, videos, magazines and other items “in a show of resolve to purge Vietnam of what the government calls culturally impure items.” Contraband materials consisted mostly of pornographic, violent or anti- communist materials (AP-Dow Jones News Service, 1997). In 2000, there were more nation-wide campaigns of cultural censorship and control. Inspectors seized 120,194 tapes, 84,054 CDs, 30 tons of printed matter, 690 video recorders and 16 gambling machines, as well as deleting 23,000 square meters of “illegal advertisement hoarding.”VNS, 2000 Foreigners had to behave carefully if they wanted to continue living and working in Vietnam, while locals had to be extremely careful, or they could lose their livelihood or face imprisonment. In the United States, the country also applied censorship to the mainstream, and even many ethnic groups had their own censorship within their communities. In terms of music, no production house was safe from anti- communist scrutiny. Even the most popular Paris By Night suffered from Vietnamese American censorship. In 1997, video “Ca Dao Me” [Mother's Folk Song], number 40 in the PBN series, was released. Though it was another highly expected PBN video, the content was soon proved to be too controversial for anti-communist groups within the Vietnamese American community. The controversy involved clips of the South Vietnamese military helicopter in battle followed by cuts of Vietnamese families running from burning villages. Anti-communist groups such as The Front claimed this depicted the South Vietnamese military as perpetrators of pain and suffering. They carried out a full campaign to demand an apology and a recall of all 40 PBN videos. Due to the pressures, PBN wrote a public apology and re-edited the offensive sections of its video for trade. Control of music production extended to control Vietnamese diasporic artists’ livelihood. Due to the pressure faced in the United States, and the improved working condition in Vietnam, a handful of Vietnamese diasporic artists chose to perform in Vietnam, suffering serious criticism from the anti-communist groups in the United States. One of the first group to return to Vietnam was Elvis Phuong in 1996. Though they encountered criticism from the community, it was a trend that more diasporic artists decided to visit or work in Vietnam every year. Some have also decided to make Vietnam their home or at least for about half of the year. Another incentive to overlook the criticism is the fan base in Vietnam. At that time, these singers were still a novelty and were known to the general population through various pirated CDs and videos. As long as artists can move beyond harassment tactics such as threatening phone calls, slanderous statements and boycotts of their products, they were relatively free to work in Vietnam. On the 25th anniversary marking the fall of Saigon, hundreds of Vietnamese Americans gathered to crush Vietnamese-made compact discs and videotapes as people cheered them on. This action is taken one step further when Vietnamese artists come to perform in the United States. No matter their fan base abroad, shows met with fierce protest in every city they were held: Boston in Massachusetts, Atlantic City in New Jersey, Fall Church in Virginia, and San Jose in California. In some cities, the protestors were even much more than the fans attended. It was not until 2000, at the peak of the “Vietnam music invasion”, that Vietnamese singers began to have the courage to perform publicly in the United States. Two decades after the renovation of 1986, when Vietnam's economy began to adopt structural-adjustment policies from the International Monetary Fund, many of the yellow and diasporic music pieces gradually resurfaced again.Taylor, P. (2000). Music as a neocolonial poison in postwar Southern Vietnam. An Interdisciplinary Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, 14(1), 99-131. Songs that once unlawfully corrupted the moral fabric of Vietnamese society even have shifted to be forms of cultural pedagogy used to teach the consumer of mass media about the values of being honest hardworking citizens.Nguyen, 2012 21st Century=New Vietnamese music in the diasporic market= On the opposite side of protesting, much other Vietnamese living in the diaspora were enjoying the new sounds from Vietnam. After 2000, in the largest Vietnamese American shopping area in Orange County, Vietnam CDs blended well with the diasporic productions except for its competitively cheap prices. They were sold at about $2 compared to the price of $8-$12 for those produced by diasporic Vietnamese. The music from Vietnam was not just heard behind closed doors in the Vietnamese American community; it appeared in the most unlikely places. In 1999, the music of one of the most famous Vietnamese singers, Thanh Lam, playing loudly at music stores in San Jose's Lion Plaza commercial centre in the heart of the Vietnamese American community in the Bay Area. At a 2000 Vietnamese American humanitarian fundraiser in San Jose, nearly half of the songs played came from post-1975 Vietnamese composers, yet no one as much as flinched in the audience. In 2001, Vietnamese American and Vietnamese music products, such as CDs, videos and karaoke discs, were placed next to each other without any barrier. This gradual takeover of the diasporic market by Vietnamese music from Vietnam has been a fascinating phenomenon to observe. Others believe that the growing Vietnamese music industry had in part to do with the lack of creativity by diasporic Vietnamese artists and poor management by overseas producers which resulted in low-quality their music. For the first time since 1975, Vietnamese diasporic music has started to show its weakness in commercial competition in Vietnam or in the diaspora. In a survey conducted by the L.A. Times in 2000, among more than 25 Vietnamese American music stores, it showed that discounts of Vietnamese diasporic music increased from 30% to 70%, not being sold as well as its Vietnamese competitors. =Musical life in Vietnam after doi moi= Since the Doi Moi economic reformation began in 1986, an increasing number of foreign tourists have visited Vietnam, constructing a new dimension to the musical life of the country. Many hotels and restaurants have hired musicians who played traditional Vietnamese music to entertain their new customers. Spectacles of musical performances present tourists with some aspects of the musical culture of Vietnam, though musicians also play westernized folk music to cater to foreigners’ tastes because of economic necessity. Many groups of traditional music artists like Tre Xanh, Phu Dong, have been sent abroad to participate in cultural festivals or to conduct concerts to the exiled Vietnamese. Though within the country, the emphasis has leaned more on Vietnamese popular music, as young singers turning toward the West. Costumes they dressed on stages are more similar to that of Western pop singers, and songs they sang are those fashionable and prevailing in foreign countries (Western, Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese). Since 1995, many Vietnamese singers have become famous in the country, and have been embracing the global market. They were able to earn approximately 20,000 US Dollars per month with shows and recordings. Some years later, more artists of folk theatre and pop singers living in Vietnam have got the opportunities to perform abroad at international music festivals or in America, Asia, Australia and Europe where Vietnamese migrants had settled in. A great number of Vietnamese oversea artists like Huong Lan, Phuong Mai, Elvis Phuong, Hoai Linh, Dalena, etc., have been back to Vietnam more frequently to perform with other Vietnamese local artists. Such a musical exchange has facilitated the buildup of the relationship between Vietnamese artists and those outside the country. The cultural industry in Vietnam shows a positive tendency towards prosperity. Some excellent musical festivals have taken place, namely the Lullaby Festival, modernized Theater Festival, Theater Song contest, the Traditional Theater Festival, etc. A considerable amount of film music has been composed to enrich the film industry in Vietnam. Furthermore, the Institute of Musicology has played an important role in the preservation and academic research of Vietnamese music. The institute is well using modern technology to help restore and preserve Vietnamese music and songs on compact discs for the longer and better conservation of sound documents. Stored in the Sound Archives of the Institute of Musicology are 8,850 pieces of instrumental music and nearly 18,000 folk songs performed by more or less 2,000 performers. Thousands of technology products in the form of an audio CD, video CD, and videotapes featuring performances on folk music have been released. Appendixes=Appendix 1: Common themes of Vietnamese exiled music= #Nostalgia for the country, nostalgia for Saigon (1975-1977) with songs evoking lost memories, such as “Vinh Biet Saigon” (Farewell Saigon) by Nam Loc (1976) and “Saigon niem nho khong ten” (Saigon, Nostalgia without Name) by Nguyen Dinh Toan (1977). #Resistance and struggle for the re-conquest of the country (1978-1981) in songs composed by Pham Duy (“Hat tren duong tam dung” / Songs on the Road of Exile, 1978), songs of struggle by Nguyet Anh (“ Em nho mau co” / Remember the Colors of the Flag, 1981); “Duoi co phuc quoc” / Under the Flag of the Re-conquest of the Country, 1981), and songs by Viet Dzung (“Luu Vong Quoc” / Melodies of the Exile, 1980; “Kinh ty nan” / Prayers of Refugees, 1981), etc. #Description of prisoners’ lives in Vietnam, found in a compilation of 20 songs by Pham Duy based on poems written by Nguyen Chi Thien (“Nguc Ca” / Songs of Jail, 1981) and melodies by the poet-musician Ha Thuc Sinh (“Tieng Hat tui nhu” / The Song of Shame, 1982), etc. #Rebirth of prewar songs (1982-1985), with thousands of cassettes recording voices of male singers (Elvis Phuong, Duy Quang, Che Linh) and female singers (Khanh Ly, Le Thu, Thanh Thuy, Thanh Tuyen, Huong Lan, Julie Quang) well known to the Vietnamese; these revive memories of the golden age of Saigon. #Birth of the Hung Ca movement (since 1985) gathered around ten young composers, including Ha Thuc Sinh, Nguyen Huu Nghia, Nguyet Anh, Viet Dzung, Phan Ni Tan, and Khuc Lan. They have composed new songs on different themes: struggle, resistance, and love, and this movement work to collect and preserve some new songs. #Development of “new wave” music and of Chinese serials music (since 1986), with about one hundred cassettes on these kinds of music (“top hit” western songs and music of Hong Kong and Taiwan movies with Vietnamese lyrics). #Diffusion of songs composed in Vietnam among Vietnamese communities overseas (since 1997). This new Vietnamese pop music has been developed in Vietnam, and many of its artists have become well known abroad. The overseas Vietnamese are interested in the newly composed songs and the young artists of Vietnam because they like to listen to another musical source and to discover new artistic faces. Vietnamese refugees are allowed to go back to Vietnam on vacation, where they discover new songs and new artists. This contact permits the export of music to foreign countries where the Vietnamese diaspora now lives. =Appendix 2: Links of songs mentioned in Appendix 1 (partially)= *“Vinh Biet Saigon” / Farewell Saigon; by Nam Loc, 1976 *“Saigon niem nho khong ten” / Saigon, Nostalgia without Name; by Nguyen Dinh Toan, 1977 *“Hat tren duong tam dung” / Songs on the Road of Exile; by Pham Duy, 1978 *“Em nho mau co”/ Remember the Colors of the Flag; by Nguyet Anh, 1981 *“Luu Vong Quoc” / Melodies of the Exile; by Viet Dzung, 1980 *“Kinh ty nan” / Prayers of Refugees; by Viet Dzung, 1981 *“Nguc Ca” / Songs of Jail; by Pham Duy, 1981 =Appendix 3: Significant time nodes in the development of Vietnamese exiled music= * Pre-1975: The development of yellow music, whose characteristics were inherited by the exiled music * 1975: The start point of Vietnamese exiled music due to the forced migration in 1975 * Post-1975: The exiled music was developed in resettled countries, although encountered restrictions or limitations in both home and host countries * 1986: Doi moi, economic reformation in Vietnam, renewing the social context for Vietnamese music * 1996: Loosening of restrictions on Vietnamese exiled music in Vietnam * 2000: Some diasporic Vietnamese artists were allowed to return to Vietnam * 2005: Basically most of those banned songs, including yellow music and exiled music were allowed to be released to the public  References Recommended Readings * Cannon, A.

Bezerra was sentenced to more than 60 years in prison and served the maximum Brazilian sentence - which is 30 years - at São José prison in Belém. He has been at liberty since 2001. Bezerra's crimes occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. What struck the attention of the specialists was the coldness of the murderer, who left the victims in vacant lots in the same way: naked, gagged, feet and hands tied with pieces of clothing and with signs of strangulation and sexual violence. According to experts, Bezerra became a serial killer because of his troubled childhood, since from an early age he had to take care of his father, who had leprosy, by sanitizing and removing the necrotic parts of the lesions caused by the disease. In addition, he had a prostitute as a mother who took him to watch her have sex with her clients. With that, Bezerra began to hate her. Autopsies from the victims' bodies indicated that the Morumbi Monster was looking for women who resembled his mother.

To help the new arrivals in the prefecture of Pieria, the Pieria Asia Minor Society () was founded.  Location  Seat of the club is at Kiou 2, corner Sarantaporou, 60100 Katerini, Pieria, Greece.  History  Library of the club Between 1914 and 1923, Greeks in Eastern Thrace and Asia Minor were persecuted by the Ottomans and forcibly evicted, culminating in the Greco- Turkish population exchange of 1923. The club was founded in 1923, for the purpose of supporting the Asia Minor refugees. The help of the Greek state and aid from abroad were not enough to support the newcomers. In 1930, the Greek state distributed land to needy residents, including the refugees. After the members no longer needed the help of the association, its activity rested from 1933 on. It was not until 1974, the club activities resumed, but the focus was now on the preservation of historical heritage and the cultivation of traditions. The club currently has (November 2018) about 900 members. The board consists of nine members; Elections are conducted every three years.  The building  In 1924, the city of Katerini donated a plot of land in the city center to the club. After the activities were discontinued in 1933, the property was given to the Peasant People's Fund, whose members came mainly from Asia Minor. In 1975 the property was returned to the club. The building was built in 1985 according to plans of the association and moved in May 1990.

Referring to Jews as \\"parasites\\" and \\"the eternal enemy\\", Tiso claimed that their deportation was both economically necessary and congruent with Christian moral principles. The speech has been recognized as a key part of Tiso's moral legacy, emblematic of his complicity in the Holocaust. Background In March 1939, the Slovak State declared independence from Czechoslovakia; Germany invaded the Czech rump state. That October, Jozef Tiso, a Catholic priest, became president of Slovakia. In an 8 March petition, Slovak Jewish community leaders exhorted Tiso to cancel the planned deportation of Slovakia's Jews because it represented the \\"physical destruction of the Jews in Slovakia\\". Tiso ignored the petition, as well as the condemnation of papal ambassador Giuseppe Burzio. At the time of Tiso's speech, 55,000 Jews out of 89,000 had been deported from the Slovak State in 54 transports; the deportations had been halted on 1 August 1942. The Slovak government knew that the deportees were being systematically murdered. Content In the speech, which was delivered on 15, 16, or 17 August 1942 in Holič, Slovakia, Tiso argued that the deportation of Jews was consistent with Christian ethics, and furthermore a positive commandment from God: Tiso claimed that Slovak Jews, representing only 5% of the population, earned 38% of the national income. He also distinguished himself from the radical wing of his party (the Slovak People's Party), invoking \\"that [old] slogan: 'Jews to Birobidzhan'\\"—which Tiso considered \\"a little bit too far\\". He claimed that Adolf Hitler was giving the Jews an independent state where the deported Jews were living, and argued that the remaining Jews had to be deported to allow the development of Slovakia. Tiso also repeated the doctrine of Andrej Hlinka, the founder of the Slovak People's Party, that \\"a Jew remains a Jew even if he is baptized by a hundred bishops\\". Reactions On 30 August, Hitler remarked, \\"It is interesting how this little Catholic priest—Tiso—is sending us the Jews!\\" The Hlinka Guard's newspaper wrote, \\"[now] no one has the right ... to doubt about the justice of deporting Jews\\". Dieter Wisliceny, SS officer and Judenberater in Slovakia, referred to Tiso's speech when arguing for the resumption of deportations in a letter dated 18 August. Slovak clergy did not react positively to the speech, critical of Tiso's political opportunism and presentation of self-love as a divine commandment. In September and October, another 2,800 Jews were deported from Slovakia; the deportations would not resume until 1944. Modern interpretations According to Austrian historian Arnold Suppan, the speech was \\"similar to the worst anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda\\". Slovak historian Eduard Nižňanský notes that the speech differed little from Tiso's previous statements on the Jews, such as his speech on Aryanization in Višňové in September 1940. Although his claims negated the Christian commandment to \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\", he appealed to nationalism to imply that Jews might not be covered by this obligation. According to Nižňanský, Tiso's aim may have been to ease the consciences of Slovaks who were uncomfortable with the regime's actions, or to disguise the brutality of deportation. Nižňanský argues that the speech should be considered in the context of Herbert Kelman's theory that \\"routinization\\" and dehumanization led to Holocaust atrocities. Tiso's speech was part of that routinization because many Slovaks trusted his moral evaluations due to his authority as priest-president. According to American historian James Mace Ward, Tiso intended to appease Nazi Germany and the radical faction of the Slovak People's Party, which were unhappy with the temporary halt in deportations. Slovak historian Ivan Kamenec wrote that the speech was Tiso's \\"most significant statement\\" on the 1942 deportations because many Slovaks believed Tiso's claims due to his authority as president and priest. Kamenec believes that it was difficult to tell if Tiso was \\"a cynical political demagogue looking for ... a justification for the evident crime against humanity\\" in which he had been complicit, or whether the speech demonstrated \\"political schizophrenia\\". According to Ward, the \\"infamous\\" speech became the \\"moral epigraph\\" of Tiso's presidency.

The Vietnam Women's Union was originally founded on October 20, 1930 and went through various name changes until the 1950s and the first National Women's Congress. Currently, membership is over 13 million members belonging to 10,472 local women's unions in communes and towns throughout the country(Smith and Newman, 2018) The current president, re-elected for the 2017-2022 term, is President Nguyen Thi Thu Ha and Vice Presidents Bui Thi Hoa, Tran Thi Huong, Hoang Thi Ai Nhien, and Nguyen Thi Tuyet.Hua, Bui Thi. Vietnam Women’s Union “Report on Promoting and Ensuring Women’s Rights” 13 June 2013. From 1931-1945 the title was the “Liberation Women’s Union” with a primary focus on rallying support for the Communist Party of Vietnam and the North Vietnam regime in the populace and combat the French colonialists in the Southern region. From 1936-1938 the name changed to the “Anti-Imperialism Women’s Union” to show their support of the Communist regime and to bring women together in opposition to the American involvement in the Vietnam War. The name again changed in 1939 until 1940 to the “Democratic Women’s Union” as well as the “Women’s League for National Salvation” during the remainder of the war until the final name change to the Vietnam Women's Union in 1950 at the first National Women's Congress. At this point, the VWU officially encouraged members to actively participate in nation building processes and support of the government through anti-French and Imperialist resistance in all aspects of their lives. The VWU strives for the advancement of women's development and gender equality, representing Vietnamese women to the state and counseling on the protection of women's rights. These policies include everything from childcare, education, community services, to health education. Originally grown from a grassroots organization, the changing ties to the political governance in the modern union and conflicting ideologies of the union has led to a top-down implementation method for the dissemination of information. The VWU is the first and only women's organization in modern Vietnamese history,Drummond, L. (2004). The Modern Vietnamese Woman: Socialization and Women’s Magazines. In L. Drummond & H. Rydström (Eds.), Gender practices in contemporary Vietnam (pp. 158–179). Singapore: Singapore University Press. and is a member of the local organization the Vietnam Fatherland Front, as well as active in international institutions like the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF) and ASEAN Confederation of Women's Organizations (ACWO). Annually, the VWU provides nominees and recipients for the award \\"For the Cause of Women's Emancipation/For the Development of Women in Vietnam\\" which may be awarded to locals and foreigners who have made noticeable contributions to the advancement of women in Vietnam. The establishment and growth of the VWU is dependent on the state government, as the overwhelming ideas of womanhood are combined in intertwined narratives. Both the National Party and the VWU worked to promote the “fairy-bird narrative” a blend of Marxist ideology and the idea of traditional Vietnamese womanhood,Chiricosta, A. (2010). Following the trail of the fairy-bird: The search for a uniquely Vietnamese Women’s Movement. In M. Roces & L. Edwards (Eds.), Women’s movements in Asia: Feminism and transnational activism. London: Routledge. to create the current gender ideals and social priorities of the VWU. Development of a Vietnamese Woman has been the purpose of the VWU's involvement in state policies and laws, with VWU's Statutes and Resolutions focusing on educated in national tradition, moral lifestyle and gender equality, as well as training on the prevention of social vices and methods to nurture happy families. In 1987, the VWU sponsored the opening of the Vietnam Women's Museum, attached to the Hanoi VWU headquarters, to expand local knowledge on the impact women have had to the advancement of Vietnamese society. There are three permanent venues on the premises depicting the evolution of the history of Vietnamese women in fashion, general history, family development. In the 1950s and 1960s there was also the publication of Phu Nu Viet Nam (Vietnamese Woman), a magazine through which to promote “socialist womanhood”—the foundation ideology of the VWU during the Vietnam War and reform eras. Much of the VWU's work has focused on the promotion of personal growth to transform and empower women in daily life, which would in turn direct the nation to reformation as an “equal and better society” after reunification. Unfortunately, these hard line feminine ideals of perfection were flawed in that women were constantly overwhelmed by the responsibilities of leading a family and a nation. Women who did not adequately personify the motions of Confucian femininity, filial piety, and national ideology were considered a shame to their family. The Party has also worked with the VWU to pull women into positions of power in the new political spheres. With the 1968 mandate that women must account for at least 30% of personnel under government organization, women and their unique concerns are increasingly being drawn onto the political stage of Vietnam. There have also been national safe house construction for women and children who are victims of domestic abuse. Much of the current political and government involvement of the VWU has been focused on creating policy to protect women and children from domestic abuse and financial dependency. Current Structure of the VWU Currently, the Vietnam Women's Union is composed of four national levels, with elections held every five years: #The central level; Complete with one president and four vice presidents. #The provincial/municipal and equivalent level (the called “provincial level”); Divided by Vietnamese provinces complete with one president and a supportive congress. #The district/precinct/provincial capital and equivalent level (the called “district level”); Regional leaders and cadre leaders for each regional headquarters. #The commune/ward and equivalent level (the called “grassroots level”). Commune and Cadre leaders for individual villages and cities. The highest body of the Union is the National Women's Congress. The leading body of the Union at each level is the Congress of Delegates or the Plenary Congress of all members at that level. Announcement of the five year goals and campaigns for the VWU are announced after the elections, and again annually should there be any changes or additions to the planning systems of the union. This is why the public announcement of planning goals are often announced in the year following the elections. History of the VWU’s “socialist femininity”=During French Colonialism to the Vietnam War= The idea of nationhood in Vietnam was popularized with women through the unity against a common enemy. By uniting against colonists—promoting the idea that the oppression of women was a necessary facet of colonial rule and that only with the overthrow of capitalist systems could women achieve equality, communists had immediate access to the social influences of women in Vietnam. Women were considered such a latent force in the Communist movement with the social unrest of women, who are generally considered to be the most exploited in all class structures and therefore more likely to support a restructuring of national rule. The Party's driving propaganda in the war was the idea that women's liberation was completely inseparable from a total social revolution. While the Party did have inefficiencies in the actual implementation of the revolutionary ideals for women in society, and the party's plans for women's liberation were more driven by the ability to indoctrinate a large portion of the population to their revolutionary cause. The Party with the help of the VWU in crafting explicit doctrines, effectively changed of traditional gendered institutions after taking power—with laws establishing equal rights in politics, economic and social lives as well as equal pay and the protections of mother and child in domestic instances. The Vietnam Women's Union (VWU) was developed as a branch of the communist leadership that works for the promotion of gender equality but was originally created to bring women to support the communist revolution. This is emphasized in the official history of the Vietnam Women's Union in both their historical publications of mission statements and in present publications. The government ties currently held between the VWU and central government remain strong—with the promotion of “socialist nationalism” and the inherent image of a “true Vietnamese woman” and female nationalism, with the dichotomies between traditional values and national obligations as well as the depiction of women as key supporters for the ideas of “equality” “national modernity” and “national progress” in the establishment of new Vietnamese traditions. Considering the entwined nature of women and the party, the origin of feminine nationalism was built around creating Party support and ensuring a woman's place in the new social structure during and after the revolution. This is especially prevalent during the war period with the idea of a new modern national female—one who fought her oppressors and would even engage in combat for the good of the nation. =Modern Conflicts in Vietnamese Womanhood= The modern constraints on the concept of feminine nationalism is the change in national priorities for women in relation to social gender equality in religion, media, and political institutions. While purely Vietnamese nationalism is still prevalent in local events, the impact of capitalist systems is unavoidable in both national image and social institutions. Women are struggling to place themselves in the post- socialist society where being independent and embodying ideals of the war era—rejecting familial piety and choosing to fight for freedom and revolution—is now considered overtly masculine. In this time, the divergence between the national traditions emphasizing sacrifice and a Confucian sense of familial duty are both similar and incongruent, leading women to struggle to articulate themselves in the middle class.Ngo, T. N. B. (2004). The Confucian Four Feminine Virtues (tu duc). In L. Drummond & H. Rydström (Eds.), Gender practices in contemporary Vietnam (pp. 47–74). Singapore: Singapore University Press. Women are fighting a catch-22 situation in terms of nationalism and political participation. If women act with traditional values, it is seen as being feudalistic, un-nationalist, and a personal fault for refusing to modernize, but if independent the nation paints women as too western, anti- nationalist, and distinctly un-Vietnamese. The efficiency and effectiveness of the VWU is contested both in application and enforcement of priorities balancing modernity and female empowerment with traditional ideologies. Vietnams enforcement of the Four Confucian Virtues of Femininity is one such example of how the government has continually enforced gender identity upon the women of Vietnam through the VWU, while maintaining a stance on promotion of equal rights and emancipation. Multiple studies have focused on the legitimacy of national VWU data and the efficiency of grassroots implementation for health services through cadre implementation—all resulting in inconclusive data. And as the union was created by the state, for the state, the data and regional work may be contested. power of the VWU as well as the lasting effects of their organizational implementations. While the VWU is promoted as a government agent of change and the Party's flagbearer of gender equality, they are accused of propagating the same dichotomy and insistence for social constructs in their policy that causes the dichotomous and unattainable images of nationalist and feminine ideals. In a targeted study on the effects of VWU policies on the livelihoods and lasting social changes on rural Vietnamese women, the VWU can symbolize the greater intentions of the Party and government to treat women as a symbol of national progress, but their implementation lacks follow-through and efficient implementation.Gabi Waibel & Sarah Glück (2013) More than 13 million: mass mobilisation and gender politics in the Vietnam Women's Union, Gender & Development, 21:2, 343-361, DOI: 10.1080/13552074.2013.802148 As a state body, the necessity of the VWU working towards both the promotion of equality in government and maintaining the stance of a pro-government directly limits their efficiency of implementation and turns the body into a factory of propaganda—limiting the power to make lasting change in the nation as well as bringing the results of governmental evaluations of the body into question for validity. Timeline of Policy and Goals=1955-1975= The goals of the VWU during the 1950s to 1970s were to liberate South Vietnam from United States forces and Imperialist control, to enforce \\"the campaign of 5 goods\\", and to promote the social campaign of women's 3 abilities. The campaign of 5 good refers to a social emphasis that women should participate in all aspects of the state and house, and do all responsibilities well. The 5 goods are in reference to the duties of a woman, another, a wife, a citizen, and a Vietnamese citizen. Each of these \\"goods\\" are descriptive of a communist Vietnamese woman, and were formatted around the ideology of the \\"feminine socialist\\" that the government was currently promoting through the VWU. \\"The campaign of 3 abilities” specifically planned the involvement of women during war-time, that the women should take over all jobs left by men in the war, encourage all of their male relatives to join the army, and to at all times support soldiers and even participate in combat if necessary. =1976-1985= In 1976, the VWU launched a new social campaign: \\"New women in the national construction and defence\\" to promote women's involvement in nation building and social restructuring during the unification and revolution era. During this period, there was still relatively constant promotion of the “5 goods” of Vietnamese women, and the creation of separate ideologies for Vietnamese women and Vietnamese nationalists. =1986-1992= Beginning in 1986, the VWU chose to change their national focus to the socio-economic development of women in the National Revolution. The movements were entitled the \\"Mutual assistance among women in household economic development, thrift for national construction\\" campaign and the \\"women actively study, creatively work and nurture happy families\\" campaign. As evidenced by the titles, the VWU now focused on women's place in the household and family as opposed to revolutions and governance of the new nation. In 1987, at the 6th national congress, the VWU opened the Vietnam Women's museum to show a history of Vietnamese women in history, fashion, and family. =1992-1997= In 1992, the VWU again launched new social movements, the “Women’s mutual assistance for household economic development” and “Good parenting to reduce children’s malnutrition and school drop-outs” campaigns—this period is where the VWU re-positions itself as a union for both women and children's rights. These campaigns focused mainly on the development of women as heads of households in communities and trying to increase the national health and literacy percentages. These were mainly implemented through increased access to education at village levels, with budgeting classes and various informational activities designed to help women lead their household and take care of children in and out of poverty. During the 1990s, the VWU was relatively quiet in their work, with a focus on building internal infrastructure within the nation at both provincial and cadre levels. =1997-2002= The new social movements for the 8th national congress were \\"Women’s mutual assistance for household economic development and savings for national construction\\" expanding the VWU into grassroots campaigning through cadres. This new campaign aimed to provide education and training to women in poverty focused on handling household finances and maintaining childhood safety.Chiricosta, A. (2010). Following the trail of the fairy-bird: The search for a uniquely Vietnamese Women’s Movement. In M. Roces & L. Edwards (Eds.), Women’s movements in Asia: Feminism and transnational activism (pp. 124–144). London: Routledge. =2002-2007= In 2007, the VWU received public notice from the late President Ho Chi Minh, who announced that \\"The beautiful country of Vietnam has been built and woven by the women, both young and old, with their heartfelt efforts to become more wonderful\\". On the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Women's Union, the VWU was awarded a curtain by the former Secretary General Do Muoi on behalf of the Party and the State reading \\"Vietnamese women are faithful, capable, talent and heroic.\\" At The 10th National Congress in Hanoi, in October 2007, Party General Nong Duc Manh presented a banner for “Vietnamese women, unity, creativeness, equality and development and contributing to national renovation in all fields”. The goals of the 2007 mission statement were to increase the general knowledge and fiscal capacity of women in Vietnam and to improve both the material and spiritual lives of native women. The specific goal was to improve the quality and abilities of Vietnamese women, to cultivate them into women who were “patriotic, knowledgeable, healthy, skilful, dynamic, innovative, cultured, and kind-hearted.” In focusing on the growth of the union, the VWU's secondary goal was to develop the organizational ability of the VWU, planning “To build and develop an organizationally strong VWU” which could be a key role in motivating women's political and domestic participation. The other explicitly stated purpose of the WVU from 2002-2007 was to focus on protecting and developing women's legitimate rights and interests in Vietnam. =2007-2012= From 2008, the VWU chose to focus on “Studying and following President Ho Chi Minh’s moral example” and ”Building affection houses” for their social and economic platforms, and specifically in the realm of women's rights chose to focus on gender equality in the workplace with the “Women and men work together as equals to share the work in building the family of 5 Without-s and 3 Clean-s”campaign. These include, building model roads and streets, creating green spaces for communities, gathering to clean public streets and areas,\\"voluntary Saturdays\\" for volunteer work and green organisations, and the promotion of women lowering the birth rate and families not having a third child.Le, Huu Phuoc - Bihn Duong News, 2015. http://baobinhduong.vn/en/-building-the-family-with-5-without-s-and-3-clean-s- campaign-promoted-a123662.html For women in grassroots areas and in response to the criticisms of unfair standards promoted in their ideal of socialist Vietnamese women, the VWU also began a social program in hopes to have women nurture their “self-confidence, self-respect, kind-heartedness and resourcefulness.” The empirical goals of this leadership were to increase participation to 80% in the Women study actively, work creatively and nurture happy families Movement, over 70% information access to non-VWU members about the Party's goals and directives, more than 60% of mothers under 16 having access to family support, and 70% of women using VWU resources reducing familial poverty and working to eliminate childhood hunger. The final goal of these five years was to increase the union's membership and local funding with over 90% of households having at least one VWU member. =2012-2017= From 2012, the VWU has increased focus on the plight of Vietnamese women and children who have been or may be victims of human trafficking. By setting up safe houses and increasing available information for the public, the VWU has begun training the most vulnerable in their country to protect themselves from individuals and organisations that may be dangerous. The results of this five- year plan will be made available later in 2018 with the announcement of the next five year planning sequence.

He served in the Michigan Senate during its first session after adoption of the state constitution.  Biography  Charles Chandler Hascall was born in Peru, Massachusetts, on November 7, 1796, to Samuel Hascall and Esther Starkweather. His father died while he was young, and he and his brother William were adopted by his uncle Jeremiah. Jeremiah already had a son named Charles, so Hascall was known as Charles Chandler or just Chandler. He served in the War of 1812. He moved to Michigan in 1819, and opened a hotel in Auburn, Michigan, as early as 1825. He was a justice of the peace in Pontiac Township, Michigan, from 1827 to 1829, and township clerk in 1829 and 1830. Complaints were made about Hascall's conduct as justice of the peace in 1828, but Territorial Governor Lewis Cass did not find sufficient cause to remove him from office. He represented Oakland County on the Territorial Council from 1832 to 1835, and was elected as a Democrat to the Michigan Senate for its first term from 1835 to 1837. Hascall moved to Genesee County in 1836. That same year, he was appointed receiver of public monies for Michigan, and resigned his senate seat on the final day of its session, on July 26, 1836, in order to begin serving in the post. He was removed from the post in 1842, and President James K. Polk re-appointed him in March 1845. Hascall reached the rank of major general in the state militia. During the Black Hawk War he was commander of the Oakland Cavalry and assembled a company of mounted men to serve under Winfield Scott. He commanded a division during the time of Toledo War, and led them on a march to Toledo in 1835, but as there was no enemy to fight, they returned to their homes soon after. He was involved with several companies building roads and railroads in Michigan. He received a contract for $20,000 () to construct the portion of a railroad extending through Genesee County in 1838 and 1839. In 1846, an act of the legislature incorporated the Pontiac and Genesee Railroad Company, with Hascall as one of its commissioners, and in 1847 he was a commissioner of the Port Huron and Lake Michigan Railroad Company. In April 1848, he became a commissioner for two separate plank road companies, one that planned to build a road from Flint, to Grand Blanc, Michigan, which was never built, and another to build a road from Flint to Fentonville, which was completed several years later. Hascall began publishing The Genesee Republican, a Democratic- aligned paper, on April 17, 1845. He was part of a committee that drafted a city charter in January 1855 that led to Flint, Michigan, becoming a city the following month. He died in Flint on October 5, 1862, and is buried there in Glenwood Cemetery. = Family = Hascall married his cousin Charlotte Hascall, the daughter of his uncle who had adopted him and his brother. They divorced, and in 1819 he remarried, to Nancy Rounds. They had one child who died while young, and five who lived to adulthood: Charles C., Angeline (also spelled Angelina and Angeolina), Esther, Richard M., and Henry C. Angeline married future Michigan governor Moses Wisner, and the two of them entertained the Prince of Wales—later Edward VII—during his tour of North America.

Gullers) Karl Werner Edmund (KW) Gullers who lived in Stockholm (September 5, 1916– February 21, 1998),Dahlman, Eva. ”En tidsepok i bild : foto: K. W. Gullers”. Fataburen : kulturhistorisk tidskrift /Nordiska museet 1994. ISSN 0348-5412. was a Swedish press and commercial photographer, and also the model for Stieg Trenter's crime novel Harry Friberg. Gullers established his photography business in 1938 under the name Studio Gullers and it was active until 1978. Early years Gullers was one of five children of Emil, a lawyer and farmer's son from Rising, Östergötland (one of the founders of what is now the Swedish Liberal Party) and Anna Charlotta Gullers, a teacher. He grew up in Klara, the most central parish in Stockholm. He was brother of Arvid Gullers, and half-brother of Waldemar Gullers, Maj Amalia Gullers, Sigrid Augusta Järemo and Emil Ragnar Gullers. He frequently borrowed his brother's camera and at the age of twelve his father bought him his own, a Kodak Brownie box camera. Three years later, in 1932, he began working for Anders Forsner, a leading photographer in Stockholm, who gave him his photographic education. He also photographed after hours, learning to use available light, which he continued to favour even for industrial photography. He was one of the founders of the blixthatarnas förening (‘flash-haters association') for hard-core press photographers. At eighteen years old, he received a scholarship for a trip to England. The trip piqued his interest in photojournalism. Photography Returning to Sweden, Gullers started working with photographer Jan de Meyere, known for his distinctive high-key portraits, at Kungsgatan 19, the street where Gullers had his studio for twenty years. He also worked as aerial photographer at Aeromateriel AB for three summers producing photographs for the first book depicting Sweden from the air. In 1938 Gullers started its own company, Studio Gullers at St Eriksgatan in Stockholm which he operated for forty years. He later employed other photographers to assist with its burgeoning business; notably his son Peter Gullers who later became an architectural photographer and also published many books,Peter Gullers: WorldCat Identities Bo Trenter (son of his friend Steig), and Georg Sessler and Björn Enström who both worked there for twenty five years. Assisting were Gullers' then wife Ingvor and Magda Persson, a skilled copyist, both recruited from Jan de Meyere's studio. After few years at St. Eriksgatan, Studio Gullers moved into one of the 1906 Kungstorn tower blocks at Kungsgatan 30. Studio Gullers AB Gullers Production Ltd was also a book publisher. On September 1, 1939, Gullers was enlisted at Västerås in 1940 and later was deployed as a war photographer. There he befriended Stieg Trenter who based his novel Harry Friberg on the photographer. They remained close until Trenters' death in 1967, and the writer's novels were used as the screenplays for a 1987 TV drama series in which the part of Harry Friberg was played by Örjan Ramberg; Träff i helfigur, Lysande landning, and Idag röd. In an accompanying TV Movie documentary Stieg Trenter - Ett porträtt, Gullers appeared as himself. Immediately after the war Gullers went to the US where he produced work for magazines and some industrial photography. Fascinated with the photo-books that started appearing in the US about that time, and meeting many of the photographers who had produced them, he returned to Stockholm inspired. He found a publisher for a picture-book on Stockholm which came out in 1946. In 1947 Ziff-Davis in Chicago also published one of his earliest books. He started to spend about 200 days of the year travelling the world. Recognition and contribution Betty Bjurström on the cover of SE, nr 13, 1941. Photographer: K.W. Gullers.During the years 1938-46, Gullers contributed pictures to a series of Swedish and foreign journals, including Picture Post, Illustrated, Se and Vi, and also wrote articles himself. Gullers had his first exhibition, \\"A bit of Sweden\\" in London in 1942. The pictures were primarily from his documentation of Sweden during the War and propaganda he produced for the government, but also of Swedish industry. In 1953, Gullers became chairman of Svenska Fotografers Förbund (SFF). Over four years as chairman he worked with, inter alia, Kerstin Bernhard and Karl Sandel on training standards and legal and pricing issues. He was succeeded by Curt Götlin.

At the beginning of twentieth century, in France, and other countries such as United States, Australia, Russia, Belgium, Italy, Egypt and Turkey there were a total of 126 Alliance committees.Encyclopædia IranicaThe Jews of Iran in the Nineteenth Century: Aspects of History, Community ...Jewish/Israel Organizations: Alliance Israelite Universelle Naser al-Din Shah Qajar – one of the kings of Qajar dynasty - travelled to Europe in 1873. In this journey Adolphe Crémieux director of Alliance Israelite universelle had a meeting with the Shah and presented him with details of the problems Iranian Jews were facing. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar approved the establishment of school by Alliance and to eliminate the religious anti-Jewish laws. Next day Alliance wrote a formal letter to Iran's Prime minister, Mirza Hosein Khan Moshir od- Dowleh to demand the establishment of Alliance school. Mirza Hosein Khan Moshir od-Dowleh officially accepted the demand. Despite the plans to build the school in 1898 due to objections by the people and other problems the start of work was proponed. Inside Iran Dr. Tholozan, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar's private doctor was assigned to this job. It was in 1889 that, for the first time, there were talks of establishing Alliance committee branches in Tehran and in Shiraz.Alliance Israelite Universelle The first Alliance school opened in Tehran in 1898, twenty-five years after the contract with Naser al- Din Shah Qajar. Members of Tehran's Jewish community welcomed Alliance's representative. This representative terminated the special patching Jews should have on their clothes. It was an innovation for the Muslim majority of Iranian populace when apart from a boys school Alliance attempted to open a school for girls.In tribute to Alliance: pictures from four Alliance schools in IranThe Past and Future of Jewish Private Schools in Iran Alliance spent little concern on Jewish religious rites and rather concentrated on modern scientific issues. This worried many Jewish parents from sending their children to this school. In Reza Shah's era this school became non- governmental and went under the control of Iran's Ministry of Education.

It was described by Frederick S. Boas as one of Shakespeare's problem plays. The play ends on a very bleak note with the death of the noble Trojan Hector and destruction of the love between Troilus and Cressida. The work has in recent years \\"stimulated exceptionally lively critical debate\\". Throughout the play, the tone lurches wildly between bawdy comedy and tragic gloom, and readers and theatre-goers have frequently found it difficult to understand how one is meant to respond to the characters. Several characteristic elements of the play (the most notable being its constant questioning of intrinsic values such as hierarchy, honour, and love) have often been viewed as distinctly \\"modern\\", as in the following remarks on the play by author and literary scholar Joyce Carol Oates: Characters=The Trojans= * Priam, King of Troy * Priam's children: Cassandra (a prophetess), Hector, Troilus, Paris, Deiphobus, Helenus, and Margarelon (bastard) * Andromache, Hector's wife * Aeneas, a commander and leader * Antenor, another commander * Calchas, a Trojan priest who is taking part with the Greeks * Cressida, Calchas's daughter * Alexander, servant to Cressida * Pandarus, Cressida's uncle =The Greeks= * Agamemnon, King of the Greeks and leader of the Greek invasion * Achilles, prince * Ajax, prince * Diomedes, prince * Nestor, wise and talkative prince * Ulysses, King of Ithaca (In some editions, the character is referred to as Odysseus.) * Menelaus, King of Sparta, brother to Agamemnon * Helen, wife to Menelaus, living with Paris * Thersites, a deformed and scurrilous low-class \\"fool\\" * Patroclus, protégé of Achilles Plot Cressida by Edward Poynter = Synopsis = Troilus and Cressida is set during the later years of the Trojan War, faithfully following the plotline of the Iliad from Achilles' refusal to participate in battle, to Hector's death. Essentially, two plots are followed in the play. In one, Troilus, a Trojan prince (son of Priam), woos Cressida, another Trojan. They profess their undying love, before Cressida is exchanged for a Trojan prisoner of war. As he attempts to visit her in the Greek camp, Troilus glimpses Diomedes flirting with his beloved Cressida, and decides to avenge her perfidy. While this plot gives the play its name, it accounts for only a small part of the play's run time. The majority of the play revolves around the leaders of the Greek and Trojan forces, Agamemnon and Priam, respectively. Agamemnon and his cohorts attempt to get the proud Achilles to return to battle and face Hector, who sends the Greeks a letter telling them of his willingness to engage in one-on-one combat with a Greek soldier. Ajax is originally chosen as this combatant, but makes peace with Hector before they are able to fight. Achilles is prompted to return to battle only after his protege Patroclus is killed by Hector before the Trojan walls. A series of skirmishes conclude the play, during which Achilles catches Hector and has the Myrmidons kill him. The conquest of Troy is left unfinished, as the Trojans learn of the death of their hero. = Act 1 = Scene 1  The play opens with a Prologue, an actor dressed as a soldier, who gives us the background to the plot, which takes place during the Trojan War. Immortalized in Greek mythology and Homer's Iliad, the war occurs because a Trojan prince, Paris, has stolen the beautiful Helen from her husband, King Menelaus of Sparta, and carries her home to Troy with him. In response, Menelaus gathers his fellow Greek kings, and they sail to Troy hoping to capture the city and reclaim Helen. Within the walls of Troy, Prince Troilus complains to Pandarus that he is unable to fight because of heartache; he is desperately in love with Pandarus's niece, Cressida. Pandarus complains that he has been doing his best to further Troilus's pursuit of his niece, and that he has received small thanks for his labors. After he departs, Troilus remarks that Pandarus has been growing irritable lately. As he ponders, the Trojan commander Aeneas comes in, bringing news that Paris has been wounded in combat with Menelaus. As the noise of battle comes in offstage, Troilus agrees to join his Trojan comrades on the field.  Scene 2  In another part of the city, Cressida converses with her servant, who recounts how a Greek warrior named Ajax, a valiant but stupid man, managed to overcome the great Trojan prince Hector the previous day, and that Hector is fighting furiously because of this defeat. Cressida is joined by Pandarus, and they discuss the Trojan princes, with Pandarus taking the unlikely position that Troilus is a greater man than Hector. As they converse, several Trojan lords pass by them returning from battle, including Antenor, Aeneas, Hector, and Paris; Pandarus praises each one, but tells his niece that none of them can match Troilus. He then leaves Cressida, promising to bring a token from Troilus. Alone, Cressida says that while she returns Troilus's feelings, she is holding him off; she is enjoying his pursuit of her.  Scene 3  In the Greek camp, the great general and king Agamemnon is conversing with his lieutenants and fellow kings. He asks why they seem so glum and downcast for although their seven-year siege of Troy has met little success so far, they should welcome the adversity that the long war represents, since only in difficult times can greatness emerge. Nestor, the oldest of the Greek commanders, cites examples of how heroism emerges from hardship. In response, Ulysses expresses his deep respect for what they have said, but points out that the Greek army is facing a crisis not because of the duration of the war, but because of a breakdown in authority within the Greek camp. Instead of being united, they are divided into factions: Achilles refuses to fight, and instead sits in his tent while his protege Patroclus makes fun of the Greek commanders; others, like Ajax and his foul-mouthed slave Thersites, follow this example, and so the entire army is corrupted. The others agree that this is a great problem, and as they discuss what is to be done, Aeneas appears under a flag of truce, bringing a challenge from Hector. The Trojan prince offers to fight any Greek lord in single combat, with the honor of their respective wives as the issue. The Greeks agree to find a champion and offer Aeneas hospitality. As Aeneas is led away, Ulysses tells Nestor that this challenge is truly directed at Achilles, since only Achilles could match the great Hector in battle. But to have Achilles fight Hector would be dangerous, because if Achilles lost, it would dishearten the entire army. Therefore, Ulysses suggests, they should have Ajax fight Hector instead; even if Ajax loses, they can still claim that Achilles would have won in his place. At the same time, by choosing Ajax as their champion, they will infuriate Achilles and perhaps goad him into rejoining the war, bringing with him all his soldiers. Nestor, impressed with Ulysses's intelligence, agrees to the plan. = Act 2 = Scene 1  In the Greek camp, Ajax summons his slave, Thersites, and orders him to find out the nature of the proclamation that has just been posted. Thersites, a foul-mouthed ruffian, refuses to obey and instead curses his master and the Greeks with equal vigor, provoking Ajax to beat him. Achilles and Patroclus come upon them and he includes them in his curses. Offended at Patroclus' request he stop, he replies \\"I will hold my peace when Achilles' brooch bids me, shall I?\\", the term \\"in the 16th century meant, among other things, a 'pointed rod, spit or pricker,'\\" implying that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers and further demeaning Achilles' masculinity. They send him away, and Achilles tells Ajax the news of Hector's challenge to any brave Greek warrior. The selection of the warrior has been put to a lottery otherwise, Achilles says as he leaves, he would have been the only possible choice, a remark that produces a sneer from Ajax.  Scene 2  In Troy, King Priam and his sons debate the wisdom of continuing the war, when they can end it by returning Helen to the Greeks. Hector, supported by his brother Helenus, argues eloquently that while the theft of Helen may have been a brave act, she cannot be worth the great and bloody price they are paying to keep her. When he is done speaking, his sister Cassandra, a prophetess who is considered mad, dashes in and cries that if they do not let Helen go, Troy will burn. When she is gone, Troilus dismisses her warning as ravings, and argues that they must keep Helen for the sake of their honor and Paris supports him. Hector retorts that this is why young men cannot be trusted to make moral decisions. since passion overwhelms their reason, but Troilus says that Helen is more than a woman, she is a theme of honor and renown, Hector yields and agrees to continue the war. He goes on to report the challenge that has been sent out to the Greeks, and how he hopes it will bring Achilles to the field.  Scene 3  Alone, Thersites sneers at the pretensions of both Ajax and Achilles. When Patroclus and Achilles appear, he calls them fools; Patroclus moves to strike him, but Achilles holds him off. They see the Greek commanders Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, and Diomedes approaching, accompanied by Ajax, and Achilles quickly retires to his tent. When Agamemnon asks to see him, Patroclus tells the general that Achilles is ill. Agamemnon grows angry, but Achilles refuses to emerge, and tells Ulysses, who goes in to see him, that he still refuses to fight the Trojans. Agamemnon suggests that Ajax go in and plead with Achilles, but Ulysses declares that doing so would be insulting to Ajax, and then he, with the other Greek commanders, praises Ajax profusely, saying that he is the best of their warriors. They agree to leave Achilles in his tent, and decide that Ajax will be their champion against Hector the next day. = Act 3 = Scene 1  In Troy, Pandarus converses with a servant while he waits to speak with Paris and Helen. When they come in, he compliments Helen profusely, and asks her to excuse Troilus if Priam asks about him at dinner that night. Paris and Helen ask where Troilus will be dining, and Pandarus refuses to tell him but they both guess that he will be in pursuit of Cressida, and they make bawdy jokes about it as they depart to greet the returning warriors.  Scene 2  Pandarus finds Troilus pacing about impatiently in an orchard, and assures him that his desire for Cressida will soon be satisfied. He goes out, leaving Troilus giddy with expectation, and brings in Cressida; after urging them to embrace, Pandarus departs. Left alone, they profess their love for one another, and each pledges to be faithful to the other. He reassures her and again pledges to be faithful, declaring that thereafter history will say of all lovers that they were as true as Troilus. Cressida declares that if she ever strays from him, she hopes that people will say of false lovers that they were as false as Cressida. Pandarus declares that if ever the pair prove false, may 'all pitiful goers-between' be called after his name.  Scene 3  Meanwhile, in the Greek encampment, Cressida's father, Calchas, who has betrayed Troy in order to join the Greeks, asks the Greek general to grant him a favor. He asks that they exchange the Trojan commander Antenor, for his daughter, so that he might be reunited with her. Agamemnon agrees, and orders Diomedes to supervise the exchange. On Ulysses's advice, the Greek commanders then file past Achilles's tent, and scorn the proud warrior, ignoring his greetings and making him uneasy. He goes to Ulysses and asks him why he is being scorned, and Ulysses tells him that he is no longer a hero and he will be forgotten quickly. He tells, and suggests that Achilles could restore his fame and honor if he stopped dallying with enemy women and took the field. When Ulysses is gone, Patroclus tells Achilles to follow Ulysses's advice; seeing that his reputation is at stake, and Achilles agrees. Thersites comes in and reports that Ajax is now striding about the camp, completely puffed up with his own importance. Patroclus persuades the foul-tongued slave to talk Ajax into bringing Hector, safely conducted by Agamemnon, to Achilles' tent after their fight the next day, so that Achilles may speak with Hector. = Act 4 = Scene 1  Diomedes comes to Troy to make the exchange of Antenor for Cressida, and he is greeted heartily by Aeneas and Paris. Aeneas goes to fetch Cressida, remarking that this exchange will deal a heavy blow to Troilus; Paris concurs, but says regretfully that they have no choice: \\"the bitter disposition of the time will have it so. After Aeneas is gone, Diomedes is asked who he thinks deserves Helen more Paris or Menelaus? With great bitterness, the Greek replies that both deserve her, since both are fools, willing to pay a great price in blood for a whore.  Scenes 2–3  Meanwhile, as morning breaks, Troilus takes a regretful leave of Cressida while she pleads with him to stay a little longer. Pandarus comes in and makes several bawdy jokes about their recent lovemaking; suddenly, there is a knock at the door, and Cressida hides Troilus in her bedroom. Aeneas enters, and demands that Pandarus fetch Troilus. When the young prince emerges, Aeneas tells him the sad news that Cressida must be sent to her father in the Greek camp. Troilus is distraught, and goes with Aeneas to see his father, Priam, while Pandarus breaks the news to Cressida, who begins to weep.  Scene 4  Troilus brings Diomedes, together with the great lords of Troy, to Cressida's house, and begs leave to say goodbye to his lady. When they are alone, he pledges to be faithful, and Cressida promises that even in the Greek camp, she will remain true to him. Then Diomedes is brought in, and Troilus demands that he \\"use her well...for, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not, Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard, I'll cut thy throat (1.4.124–129). Diomedes retorts that he will make no promises he will treat Cressida as she deserves, but not because any Trojan prince orders him to. At that moment, a trumpet sounds, calling them all to the Greek camp for the duel between Hector and Ajax.  Scene 5  In the Greek camp, the newly arrived Cressida is greeted by all the Greek commanders. Ulysses insists that she be kissed by everyone, only then refusing to kiss her himself and when she is gone, he declares that she is a loose, unvirtuous woman. Then the Trojan lords arrive, and the conditions of the duel are set by Aeneas, who remarks that since Ajax and Hector are related, Hector's whole heart will not be in this fight. As the two combatants prepare, Agamemnon asks Ulysses \\"what Trojan is that same that looks so heavy\\" (4.5.113.1). Ulysses tells his general that the downcast Trojan is Troilus, and then goes on to praise him profusely, saying that Troilus may even be a greater man than Hector. = Act 5 = Scene 1  Achilles boasts to Patroclus how he will kill Hector. The two encounter Thersites, who delivers a letter to Achilles, and then unloads his usual torrent of abuse on them, calling Patroclus Achilles' male varlot, his 'masculine whore', and on the entire campaign. The letter is from the Trojan princess, Polyxena, whom Achilles loves, and it begs him not to fight the next day; he tells Patroclus sadly that he must obey her wishes. They go out, and Thersites remains; he watches from the shadows as the feast breaks up. Most of the lords go to bed, but Diomedes slips off to see Cressida, and Ulysses and Troilus follow him. Noting that Diomedes is an untrustworthy, lustful rogue, Thersites follows him as well.  Scene 2  At Calchas's tent, Diomedes calls to Cressida. Her father fetches her, while Troilus and Ulysses watch from one hiding place and Thersites from another. With Thersites's profanity and Troilus's shock providing a counterpoint, Diomedes woos Cressida, who behaves reluctantly but coyly toward his advances, fending him off for a time but never allowing him to leave. Eventually, she gives him a sleeve that Troilus presented to her as a love-token then she takes it back, and says that she never wants to see Diomedes again then she softens, gives it to him once more, and promises to wait for him later, when he will come to sleep with her. When she is gone, and Diomedes too, Troilus is in agony, first denying the evidence seen with his own eyes, and then pledging to find Diomedes on the field of battle and kill him. Finally, as morning nears, Aeneas arrives to lead him back to Troy.  Scene 3  Hector girds for battle, while the women, i.e. his wife, Andromache and his sister, Cassandra plead with him not to go. Both have had dreams that prophesize his death, but he dismisses their warnings. Troilus comes in and says that he will be fighting too; indeed, he chides Hector for having been too merciful to his enemies in the past, saying that today Troilus plans to slay as many men as he can. Cassandra leads Priam in, and the old king pleads with his son not to fight, saying that he too feels foreboding about this day, but Hector refuses to listen and goes out to the battlefield. Pandarus brings Troilus a letter from Cressida; Troilus tears it up and follows Hector out to the field.  Scene 4  As the battle rages, Thersites wanders the field, escaping death by brazen cowardice.  Scene 5  Another part of the plains, Agamemnon summarises the ways the Greeks are doing badly in the battle, including that Doreus is taken prisoner and Patroclus probably slain. Then Nestor enters and says that \\"There is a thousand Hectors in the field\\" (5.4.3.) The scene ends with Achilles asking where Hector is.  Scene 6  Troilus calls Diomed a traitor for capturing his horse. Diomed, Ajax and Troilus exit, fighting. Hector spares the unprepared Achilles, who boasts that Hector was simply fortunate to find him unarmed. Hector sees a Greek in ornate armour and pursues him.  Scene 7  In another part of the plains. Menelaus and Paris enter the scene fighting. Thersites is confronted by a bastard son of Priam, but declares that as he is himself a bastard they have no business fighting each other.  Scene 8  Achilles and his men find Hector, who has finished fighting and taken off his armour in order to try on the golden armour of the warrior he has conquered. Surrounding the unarmed Trojan, they stab him to death.  Scene 9  Agamenon, Ajax, Menelaus, Nestor, Diomedes and others enter marching. Word arrives of the death of Hector.  Scene 10  Left alone on the stage, the unhappy Pandarus wonders why he should be so abused, when his services were so eagerly desired only a little while before.  Genre identification problems  The difficulties about the date of the play are insignificant compared with the difficulties of its genre identification. A famous 19th century literary critic named Frederick S. Boas argued that Troilus and Cressida (along with Measure for Measure and All's Well That Ends Well), deserves its own special  \\"Problem Play.\\"Boas, Frederick S. (1910). Shakespeare and his predecessors. New York: C. Scribner's Sons. pp. 369–370 The term problem play was drawn from the socially conscious drama of playwrights contemporaneous with Boas, like Ibsen and Shaw, and describes a play centred on a social or political problem in such a way as to promote debate but not easy resolution.http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100347336 The confusing nature of Troilus and Cressida made it hard for readers to understand the play. The category of genre is one easy way in which to make sense of a play, but then naturally arises the question \\"To which genre does Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida belong?\\" It has been called a tragedy, \\"a comedy of disillusion\\", . . .a wry-mouthed comedy\\",\\" . . . a satire . . . a piece of propaganda . . . a morality . . . and (of course) a Problem Play\\". Unfortunately, neither critics nor dramatists have been successful in its categorization. Yet the deep sense of Troilus and Cressida, according to Anthony B. Dawson, lies exactly in its perplexity: \\"It is still full of puzzles, but that fact has been recognized as a virtue rather than a defectits difficulties are generative, its obstacles fruitful\\".Dawson, Anthony B. (2003). Introduction. Troilus and Cressida. New York: Cambridge UP. p. 6 Positioned between the Histories and the Tragedies in the First Folio, it resembles tragedy despite the lack of typical tragic plot structure. Nowadays Troilus and Cressida is often grouped with the so-called \\"problem comedies\\" with Measure for Measure and All's Well That Ends Well. Throughout this work we can observe Shakespeare's tone changing from light comic to intensely tragic. Literary critic and scholar Joyce Carol Oates wrote that in reality these shifts complimented the values Shakespeare questioned in the play: love, honour, and hierarchy. To Oates Troilus and Cressida is one of the most intriguing plays ever written, and in her opinion appears remarkably 'modern'. Oates considered the play a new kind of contemporary tragedy - a grand existential statement.Oates, Joyce Carol (1966/1967). \\"The Tragedy of Existence: Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida\\". Originally published as two separate essays, in Philological Quarterly, Spring 1967, and Shakespeare Quarterly, Spring 1966. Sources The first page of Troilus and Cressida, printed in the First Folio of 1623 The story of Troilus and Cressida is a medieval tale that is not part of Greek mythology; Shakespeare drew on a number of sources for this plotline, in particular Chaucer's version of the tale, Troilus and Criseyde, but also John Lydgate's Troy Book and Caxton's translation of the Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye.Palmer, Kenneth (ed., 1982). Troilus and Cressida (Arden Shakespeare: Second Series). London: Methuen. Chaucer's source was Il Filostrato by Boccaccio, which in turn derives from a 12th-century French text, Benoît de Sainte-Maure's Roman de Troie.Theodore Morrison, The Portable Chaucer, Viking Press, 1949, p. 363. The story of the persuasion of Achilles into battle is drawn from Homer's Iliad (perhaps in the translation by George Chapman), and from various medieval and Renaissance retellings. The story was a popular one for dramatists in the early 17th century and Shakespeare may have been inspired by contemporary plays. Thomas Heywood's two-part play The Iron Age also depicts the Trojan War and the story of Troilus and Cressida, but it is not certain whether his or Shakespeare's play was written first. In addition, Thomas Dekker and Henry Chettle wrote a play called Troilus and Cressida at around the same time as Shakespeare, but this play survives only as a fragmentary plot outline. Date and text Title page, 1609 quarto edition The play is believed to have been written around 1602, shortly after the completion of Hamlet. It was published in quarto in two separate editions, both in 1609. It is not known whether the play was ever performed in its own time, because the two editions contradict each other: One announces on the title page that the play had been recently performed on stage; the other claims in a preface that it is a new play that has never been staged. The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 7 February 1603, by the bookseller and printer James Roberts, with a mention that the play was acted by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company. Publication followed in 1609; the stationers Richard Bonian and Henry Walley re-registered the play on 28 January 1609, and later that year issued the first quarto, but in two \\"states\\". The first says the play was \\"acted by the King's Majesty's servants at the Globe\\"; the second version omits the mention of the Globe Theatre, and prefaces the play with a long epistle that claims that Troilus and Cressida is \\"a new play, never staled with the stage, never clapper-clawed with the palms of the vulgar\\".Halliday, F.E. (1964). A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964, Baltimore: Penguin; pp. 501–503. Some commentators (like Georg Brandes, the Danish Shakespeare scholar of the late 19th century) have attempted to reconcile these contradictory claims by arguing that the play was composed originally around 1600–1602, but heavily revised shortly before its 1609 printing. The play is noteworthy for its bitter and caustic nature, similar to the works that Shakespeare was writing in the 1605–1608 period, King Lear, Coriolanus, and Timon of Athens. In this view, the original version of the play was a more positive romantic comedy of the type Shakespeare wrote ca. 1600, like As You Like It and Twelfth Night, while the later revision injected the darker material – leaving the result a hybrid jumble of tones and intents. The Quarto edition labels it a history play with the title The Famous Historie of Troylus and Cresseid, but the First Folio classed it with the tragedies, under the title The Tragedie of Troylus and Cressida. The confusion is compounded by the fact that in the original pressing of the First Folio, the play's pages are unnumbered, the title is not included in the Table of Contents, and it appears to have been squeezed between the histories and the tragedies. Based on this evidence, scholars believe it was a very late addition to the Folio, and therefore may have been added wherever there was room.

Being composed around 1602, the play was most probably staged between 1602–1603, although no record of performance was saved. Taking into account previous information and the fact that the play was not published for 6 more years, it has been suggested that work was performed only once, or not at all. It is possible that the lack of performance history was caused by the play's very perplexing, contradictory nature: the tone of the play constantly moves from comedy action to tragedy. In any case, there is a lack of performance history until the early 20th century. Since then, it has become increasingly popular, particularly following World War I. The most famous production of this play in recent years is the Royal Shakespeare Company and The Wooster Group (American) collaboration, which was performed in the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon (RSC) in 2012, and co-directed by Mark Ravenhill and Elizabeth LeCompte. This production resulted in widely mixed reviews with some critics condemning it as 'disjointed' and even offensive, whilst others praised it as an 'intelligent, engaged and honourable realisation of a play full of intractable questions' .Billington, M. (2016) 'Shakespeare Live! Review – like an upmarket Royal Variety Show', Guardian, 24 April. In comparison to the performance history of other, more frequently performed plays, the delayed acceptance of Troilus and Cressida into the theatre also means that the claims of relevance become especially acute. When the play had been chosen for performance during the twentieth century, while being out of fashion before, it showed us that there was something about its themes and subject matter which was familiar to the soul of contemporary audience. Colin Chambers characterises the mood of that period in the following way : There were signs that British theatre was beginning to reconnect to its society, having previously failed, in [Peter] Hall’s words, \\"to take into account the fact that we have had a World War […] and that everything in the world has changed – values, ways of living, ideals, hopes and fears\\". Theatre was staking its claim as a cultural force of significance.Chambers, C. (2004) Inside the Royal Shakespeare Company: Creativity and the Institution. London: Routledge. p. 9 As Barbara Bowen points out: 'We see the play as modern partly because we have so little history of premodern readers seeing the play'.Bowen, B. (1993) Gender in the Theater of War: Shakespeare’s 'Troilus and Cressida'. New York and London: Garland Publishing Inc. p. 32 The play has been prescribed a role of a mirror, which reflects political issues and concerns of those times. It was also represented as a play which 'really is about Vietnam'. During his preparation for the 1968 RSC production John Barton commented that within the play \\"…the war [is] an image of a Vietnam situation, where both sides are inexorably committed\\".Barton, J. (1968) 'Director’s notes to the company at rehearsal' in Troilus and Cressida, Royal Shakespeare Company [Theatre programme], 1968. The whole performance history of Troilus and Cressida is filled with this large number of connections between the play and contemporary warfare. = Modern revivals = The BBC broadcast a modern- language and modern-dress version by Ian Dallas as The Face of Love in 1954, which was then staged by RADA at the Vanbrugh Theatre in 1956, providing Albert Finney with his first lead stage role. In July 2009, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey presented a production as part of their annual Shakespeare in the Parks series. Director Jon Ciccarelli set the action in ancient Greece but sought to put a modern twist on the action by comparing the title pair to Romeo and Juliet and posing the question: would their relationship have lasted if they had lived? Ciccarelli hypothesized that Shakespeare knew the answer and that it was that it would have not. He stated that Troilus and Cressida pine for each other, like their more famous counterparts, and share a passionate evening, the morning after which Troilus is eager to leave. Cressida is later exiled from Troy and quickly takes up with another man proving love is fickle and fleeting. Other notable departures show that the Greek heroes are anything but heroic, showing Shakespeare satirized revered figures like Achilles as childish and barbaric, and sympathized with the pragmatic Hector. The Public Theater has produced three revivals, in 1965, 1995, and 2016.  Literary and cultural references  The siege of Troy was one of the popular literary subjects in England circa 1600 and was among the most important events in world history for the contemporaries of Shakespeare. An abundance of allusions in Shakespeare's complete works show that Shakespeare felt able to assume his audience would be aware of this narrative material. In addition, from the records of Philip Henslowe two lost dramas on this subject are known. Translations of the Iliad were conducted in Elizabethan England in Greek, Latin and French; moreover, George Chapman's first part of the Homer edition contained an English version. Shakespeare probably knew the Iliad translation of his contemporary and poetic rival Chapman and probably drew her for some details of his work, but unmistakably resorted in essential areas to the medieval and post-medieval traditions of tradition.Schabert, Ina (2009). Shakespeare Manual. Kröner, 5th rev. Edition, Stuttgart, , pp. 437–442. Others say the two storylines of Troilus and Cressida, the love story for the title characters and the warfare mainly around Hektor, Ajax and Achilles, have a completely different origin. While the warfare is of ancient origins and is at the core of the Troy saga in the Homeric epics, especially the Iliad, the story of Troilus and Cressida is part of the narrative material of the Middle Ages. It does not come from Greek mythology, but belongs to the narrative motifs found in the medieval retelling of the popular material. For the first time, this additional story is a medieval addition to Benoît de Sainte-Maure in his novel de Troie, which was written for the court of King Henry Plantagenet as a kind of prince mirror. For his part, Benoît used stories from Dicty's Cretensis and Dares Phrygius from the late Roman period, which entwine around the Iliad material. The Roman de Troie was a source for Boccaccio's \\"Il Filostrato,\\" which in turn was the main source for Chaucer's poetry \\"Troilus and Criseyde\\" (c. 1380); Shakespeare knew Chaucer's works very well.W. W. Greg: The Printing of Shakespeare's \\"Troilus and Cressida\\" in the First Folio. In: Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America. Band 45, 1951, S. 273–282. Other versions of the material, such as John Lydgate's \\"Troy Book\\" and Caxton's \\"Recuyel of the History of Troy\\", were at the time of Shakespeare in England in circulation and probably known to him. In the traditions of Middle English literature, the material was presented on the one hand in a knightly courtly form, but on the other hand increasingly transformed in a negative-critical way. Above all, the image of Cressida changed in the course of the 16th century, so that at the turn of the century Troilus and Cressida had become increasingly included in infidelity and falsity and the name Pandarus was even used as a synonym for couplers (\\"pander\\"). Accordingly, Shakespeare's arrangement of events and figures is part of a longer tradition of transforming and, in particular, devaluing the narrative material. Almost all the characters prove unworthy of their reputation on the background of their legendary reputation. In his drama, Shakespeare does not simply intensify these negative tendencies, but links and superimposes contradictory characterizations in order to make his characters interesting and accessible to his audience.

He was an ancestor to both Cardinal Gabriele Ferretti and Pope Pius IX having been descended from a long noble lineage. Ferretti entered the religious life after becoming of age and soon after his ordination held two important leadership positions in the order. He set about restoring run down Franciscan convents in the region as well as seeing to the establishment of new ones to deal with an influx of new novices. Ferretti's beatification cause could be traced soon after his death after Pope Callixtus III had Giacomo della Marca collect evidence that would attest to Ferretti's saintliness. Pope Benedict XIV later beatified Ferretti on 19 September 1753 in a decree that recognized his official \\"cultus\\" (or longstanding and popular veneration). Life Gabriel Ferretti was born circa 1385 in Ancona as the eldest of ten children to the devout Count Liverotto Ferretti (a count since 1397) and Alvisia Sacchetti (who married in 1378) who were responsible for his upbringing in the Christian faith. He was an ancestor to future Cardinal Gabriele Ferretti and the future Pope Pius IX. His paternal grandfather was Francesco Ferretti and his paternal great-grandfather was Pietro Ferretti. His maternal grandfather was Simone Sacchetti. His siblings included: * Francesco (1380-1435) - served as a podestà in several Italian cities. * Paolina * Pietro - made the uncanonical Bishop of Ancona (under Antipope John XXIII) and later the canonical Bishop of Ascoli Piceno (under Pope Martin V). In 1403 he entered the Order of Friars Minor at their convent church of San Francesco ad Alto stationed in his hometown and did his novitiate and formation there prior to his solemn profession into the order. Ferretti achieved excellent results in his philosophical and theological studies during this time. He became respected for his virtuous and meek nature and after his ordination to the priesthood in 1410 was appointed to preach in the region which he did until 1425. It was following this preaching period that he was then assigned as the guardian for the Ancona convent in 1425 while he was soon after elected as the order's provincial for the entire Ancona province in 1434. He was diligent in enacting the functions of that office but was known for strict observance to the Franciscan rule; he was known to be severe with those who were lax in their observance of the rule. Ferretti once travelled to Assisi but en route visited the Franciscan church in Foligno where the sacristan mistook him for being a simple religious brother. The sacristan asked him to serve the Mass for a priest who had just gone to the altar to prepare the Mass. Ferretti did so in obedience but the convent guardian recognized him at once and reproached the sacristan whom Ferretti defended. He said: \\"To serve Mass is a great privilege. The angels would consider themselves honored. So do not blame the brother for conferring that honor on me!\\" His reputation for preaching to the masses was noted to the point where Giacomo della Marca - who was preaching in Bosnia - asked for his help in that task. But the Ancona council in their deliberations on 22 February 1438 passed a resolution asking Pope Eugene IV to ensure the friar remained in Ancona due to all his good works. The pope accepted this request which meant that Ferretti could not go to Bosnia to aid his friend. He was zealous in the restoration and establishment of new convents. In San Severino Marche he restored the Santa Maria delle Grazie convent that had fallen into ruin while building the San Nicolò convent in Ascoli Piceno and then Santissima Annunziata in Osimo. He also saw to the enlargement of his own in Ancona in order to accommodate a stream of new novices who had come for admittance and formation in the order. Ferretti also advised on occasion the Bishop of Ancona, Antonio Fatati. In 1449 he left the post of provincial and became instead the superior for the convent church of San Francesco ad Alto which he remained until 1452. Ferretti died in his cell in his convent on 12 November 1456 with Giacomo della Marca at his deathbed. It was he who delivered Ferretti's funeral oration in which he spoke of his virtue and holiness. Ferretti's remains were interred at San Francesco ad Alto until 1489 when his remains were exhumed with his sister Paolina organizing the new tomb for him; Pope Innocent VIII approved the exhumation on 17 July 1489 in the papal bull Desideratis ut. His remains were moved once more on 14 May 1862 to the Ancona Cathedral until their final transfer on 30 January 1943 to the San Giovanni Battista church that Ferretti's order managed. Beatification Former tomb in the Ancona Cathedral. The reputation for Ferretti's holiness went further than Ancona to all those places he had visited during his lifetime. Pope Callixtus III - in 1456 just after the friar's death - ordered Giacomo della Marca to collect evidence that would attest to Ferretti's saintliness. Pope Benedict XIV later beatified Ferretti on 19 September 1753 in a decree that confirmed the friar's local \\"cultus\\" (or longstanding and popular veneration). That pope himself knew of Ferretti and his saintliness while he served as Bishop of Ancona prior to his pontifical election.

As a rower he was twice an Australian national champion and he won the Grand Challenge Cup in an Australian representative eight racing as Sydney Rowing Club at the 1912 Henley Royal Regatta. He saw action in WWI in German New Guinea, Gallipoli and on the Western Front and was awarded the Military Cross. Family history Born and raised near Launceston, Tasmania, Heritage was one of eight children of George and Eleanora Heritage, of Longford. Keith Heritage's English grandfather James stole a book in Somerset and later, a silver plate worth five pounds. For these crimes he was transported as a convict to Van Diemen's Land.1st Anzac James Heritage served his time, trained as a draper's assistant, married and had three children.

Heritage was then controversially replaced by Hugh Ward, a UK resident Australian medical student who had raced for New College, Oxford against the Sydney eight at Henley that year. With Heritage changed out for Ward, the Sydney eight went on to compete as an Australasian representative eight in the 1912 Summer Olympics Men's eight race and was knocked out in their second match race - a quarter-final. They were beaten by the same Leander eight they'd beaten at Henley a few weeks earlier.1912 Australian Olympics Military career Before leaving Tasmania Heritage had military experience including five years with the Tasmanian Infantry Regiment as a Sergeant and six years with the Launceston Infantry Regiment where he held the rank of Colour Sergeant in a machine-gun section. Post-war research determined that Heritage was the first Australian to enlist for service in World War I, joining up on 11 August 1914. At the time of joining the army one week after Britain's declaration of war, Heritage was aged 32, a bachelor living in Sydney where he worked for the Union Steam Ship Company as a Traffic Manager.News.com 100 days of heroes The First Australian Imperial Force had not yet been formed in August 1914. Heritage joined the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force which was assembled and dispatched to New Guinea within days of the war commencing, with the objective of ousting Germany from its colonies in New Guinea. Heritage was appointed a Lieutenant Transport Officer and sailed on the HMAT Berima on 17 August 1914 to Rabaul, in New Britain where was part of the force that secured the German communications facility in German New Guinea.Centenary of Anzac Heritage returned to Australia in 1915 and joined the 19th Battalion AIF as a Lieutenant.Heritage at the AIF Project On 21 August 1915 he landed at Gallipoli with his Sydney Rowing Club and Australian crew mate Sydney Middleton. He served in Gallipoli for several months until the Anzac force was evacuated and during that period was promoted to Captain. He was commended for his work helping plan the troops’ departure under cover of darkness, left the Gallipoli peninsula during the evacuation on the night of 19 December and was one of the last Anzacs to be evacuated from the peninsula. Heritage then served on the Western Front in France. On 1 July 1916 his bravery was noted by General Sir William Birdwood, following a successful raid on enemy trenches on the night of 25–26 June and for which was awarded the Military Cross The London Gazette of 25 August 1916 stated that the medal had been conferred by King George V in recognition of Heritage's devotion to duty in the field and conspicuous gallantry during a raid on the German trenches when about twenty of the enemy were killed and four prisoners taken. The raid was a quick-strike - to be in and out before the Germans could counter-attack. Heritage's raiding party occupied the trenches for just five minutes and blew up two munitions stores. Heritage then ordered his men back to the Australian positions and waited in the German trench until his patrol was on its way back.

It is likely Heritage never knew of the honour as was killed in action and buried in the field at Pozieres a month before news of his award was made public. On 26 July 1916 a month after his gallant raid, Heritage was killed in action. While making his rounds in the trenches on 26 July 1916 he told two tired-looking soldiers to take a break. He gave them some of his own food and took up their post. Within moments, a high-explosive shell landed upon him, killing him instantly. According to a statement by Lieutenant L Layton-Smith: \\"Captain Heritage was killed outright at Pozieres on 26 July 1916. He was buried in the field at Pozieres and a cross was erected over his grave. This however may now have disappeared in view of the subsequent fighting which took place on that ground in 1918.\\" He is commemorated in the British Pozières Memorial, Ovillers-La Boisselle, Pozieres. Family war service Four of Heritage's brothers also saw action in the First World War. Francis Bede Heritage was awarded the French Croix de Guerre and after the war headed the Royal Military College, Duntroon. He retired as army quartermaster- general. Lieutenant Austin Heritage also received the Military Cross for leading his men in an attack on a heavily defended position and rallying them while wounded and under heavy fire. Sapper Robert Heritage was serving with a pioneer battalion and was sent home after suffering a severe septic infection. The fifth brother, Stanley Heritage, was working in Nevada when war broke out and he went north to join the Canadian forces.

Moroccan truck driver Boujemaa Lamrabat was sentenced to life in prison for her murder in September 2019. Timeline On 14 June 2018, Lösche started her journey by train and wanted to travel the last few kilometres by hitchhiking. On the way she entered a lorry in Schkeuditz near the A9 Autobahn and she was murdered at a highway stop in Upper Franconia according to the police investigation and her body was carried 1600 km in the lorry through Europe to northern Spain. Five days later on 19 June 2018, a Moroccan lorry driver was arrested south of Madrid. On 22 June 2018, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez offered condolences to the Lösche family and to Andrea Nahles, head of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) at that time. On 29 June 2018, the German public prosecutor's office and police in Bayreuth announced that her remains had been found in Asparrena (Álava) in northern Spain and identified using DNA tracing. During a church remembrance ceremony for Lösche in August 2018 organized by friends and family, the chairman of the council of the Evangelical Church in Germany, Bishop Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, criticised hateful comments in the Internet and their effects on her family. Bedford- Strohm, bishop of the evangelical church in Bavaria, knew Lösche as a student from his tenure as a professor at University of Bamberg. In August 2018, Kriminalpolizei officials brought the suspect from Spain to Bavaria in Germany. In late August 2018, during the Chemnitz protests following the murder of a football supporter, the anti-immigration group calling themselves Pro-Chemnitz organized by Pegida and Alternative for Germany carried banners with pictures of murder victims, among which was the photo of Lösche which led to her family initiating legal action against those who used her picture to further a political agenda. In October 2018 her brother was interviewed by German monthly magazine Cicero on the hate mail sent to the family after the murder of his sister.  Victim  Lösche was a student at the University of Bamberg in Bavaria. She was politically active and was the president of the University SPD student club. The political aim of the club according to German media was that Bamberg become more diverse. From 2016 Lösche travelled regularly to the Greek island Lesbos as a volunteer for the No Borders NGO to cook for migrants arriving from Turkey. According to her brother, Lösche was involved in several initiatives \\"against racism, freedom of movement and opening of borders\\". The coroner found no indications that Lösche had been subjected to sexual violence.  Suspect and trial  The main suspect was Boujemaa Lamrabat, a male Moroccan national born in 1977, who picked up Sophia Lösche in his truck on his way to Morocco via France and Spain. On 14 June 2019, the ' announced that the trial for murder would commence on 23 July. While the prosecution had at first suspected a sexual motivation for the crime, the coroner found no evidence to support this and the prosecution therefore accused Lamrabat of murder and grievous bodily harm. In September 2019, Lamrabat was sentenced to life in prison for murder. The court found that the suspect had at first seriously wounded Lösche with a wheel brace, then killed her later to hide the crime.

In the background — Anichkov Palace The Cabinet of His Imperial Majesty, colloquially the Imperial Cabinet was an institution that was in charge of the personal property of the Russian Imperial family and dealt with some other issues in 1704—1917. History The Cabinet was established in 1704 by Peter the Great, was the Tsar's Own Office, was in charge of his treasury and property, kept a correspondence. At its head was the cabinet secretary Alexey Makarov. It was closed after the death of Peter, on June 7, 1727. Anna Ioannovna in 1731 created the highest state body — the Cabinet of Her Majesty, which consisted of three ministers. In 1735 a decree was issued, which the signature of the three cabinet ministers equated to the imperial signature. This body had nothing to do with the Peter's cabinet, except for the name. Having ascended to the throne, Elizabeth Petrovna began to restore the institutions of her father's time. The Cabinet was restored on December 23, 1741, as the personal office of the Empress; Baron Ivan Cherkasov was appointed manager of its affairs. Among other things, the offices that served the imperial palaces were transferred to the cabinet:Ministry of the Imperial Court in the Russian Empire *Imperial Porcelain Factory; *Imperial Glass Factory; *Imperial Tapestry Manufactory; *Peterhof Lapidary Plant; *Peterhof Paper Mill; *Tsarskoye Selo Paper Mill; *Tsarskoye Selo Wallpaper Factory; *Gornoschitsky Marble Factory; *Kiev- Mezhigorsk Faience Factory; *Yekaterinburg Lapidary Factory; *Vyborg Mirror Factory; *Peterhof and Ropshinskaya Paper Mills; *Tivdia Marble Breaking. Catherine the Great singled out from the cabinet office the office of state secretary who was in charge of her own affairs, including appeals and petitions addressed to the empress. With the formation of the Ministry of the Imperial Court in 1826, the cabinet became part of it. After the February Revolution of 1917, the Provisional Government decided on March 17 to transfer the Cabinet of His Imperial Majesty to the Ministry of Finance, appointing a member of the State Duma, Ivan Titov, to manage its affairs. The Minister of Finance Mikhail Tereshchenko was instructed to clarify the issue of the possible use of available funds of the Cabinet in bonds of an internal military loan. Office building The Cabinet of His Imperial Majesty. Right in the background — Anichkov Palace. In the foreground on the left — part of Anichkov Bridge During the reign of Alexander I, his office was occupied by the Anichkov Palace at the corner of Nevsky Prospect and Fontanka. His ceremonial courtyard (Nevsky Prospect, 39) was built up in 1803–09 by two buildings of the mall, which was designed in the style of mature classicism by Giacomo Quarenghi. These two low 2-storey buildings were expanded in 1811 by an extension from the courtyard and transferred to the full authority of the Imperial Cabinet. Until 1885, the facades of a building with columns of a \\"giant\\" Ionic order penetrated wide arcades, through which a view of the Anichkov Palace opened. In 1885, the arcades were laid. From the Fontanka side to this day there is an open colonnade with a driveway into the courtyard. Since 1937 the building housed the Leningrad Palace of Pioneers, now the . Cabinet lands The Cabinet lands were the property of the imperial family, ruled by the cabinet of his imperial majesty. The Cabinet lands were concentrated in Altai (from 1747), in Transbaikal (from 1786), in Poland (Łowicz Principality — 3 counties with several dozen estates). In Siberia, the Cabinet lands occupied 67,800,000 hectares. Kabinetskaya street (now — Sovetskaya) in Novosibirsk received its name because of the city’s belonging to the Cabinet. Gold, silver, lead, and copper were mined on the office lands; there were plants for smelting iron, iron, and steel. In 1796, about 70,000 audit souls, exiled convicts, and hired workers were assigned to the Cabinet lands. In the second half of the 18th century, mining enterprises in the Cabinet lands reached a high level of development. In the first half of the 19th century, they could not withstand competition with the developing capitalist industry, were closed or leased. Since 1861, the administration of the Cabinet lands goes over to the enhanced exploitation of forests, leasing land. From 1865, resettlement to Cabinet lands was permitted, and by 1907, up to 1,000,000 peasants were resettled. Office lands in Altai before the October Revolution were given annually from 3 to 4 000 000 rubles of income. After the February Revolution of 1917, the Cabinet lands were confiscated, and the cabinet was subordinated to the Ministry of Finance. It was liquidated on February 26, 1918.

It aired in the United States on Fox on November 24, 2019. The episode was written by Dan Vebber, and was directed by Rob Oliver. On February 1, 2020, Dan Vebber won the Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 72nd Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode and the episode was nominated for an Emmy in 2020 for Outstanding Animated Program. This is the final episode featuring Russi Taylor, who had been with the show since the first season voicing characters such as Martin Prince, Sherri and Terri, and Uter, due to her death on July 26, 2019. Plot A Thanksgiving take on Treehouse of Horror looking at the past, present and future of the holiday. Turkeys are slaughtered by pilgrims during the first Thanksgiving, Homer purchases an A.I. based on Marge that resents the real one, and an already dangerous space mission escaping a doomed Earth becomes worse when Bart's attempts to replicate cranberry sauce turn it into a sentient monster. =A-Gobble-Ypto= In a parody of Apocalypto, the Simpson family and some other Springfield residents are depicted as turkeys, while others are depicted as Pilgrims. When the latter hunt for their Thanksgiving dinner, Homer is among the turkeys captured; Bart escapes but follows them back to their settlement. Several turkeys are bloodily killed, but a panic erupts when the turkey version of Grampa continues to run around with his head cut off. In the confusion, Bart rescues Homer and they reunited with their family as Marge lays an egg, but are chased by Chief Wiggum until a bear mauls him to death. The egg then hatches to reveal a turkey version of Maggie. Upon watching some Pilgrims eat turkey dinner, Homer comments that times will be dark for them as Thanksgiving becomes a new human tradition. =The Fourth Thursday After Tomorrow= In a parody of the Black Mirror special \\"White Christmas\\", to help Marge with the Thanksgiving cooking as the Simpsons are holding a dinner party for many of their friends, Homer orders an A.I. with all of her memories, who acts as the protagonist of this story. Marge becomes jealous as the A.I. proves better at running the family than her. She decides to delete her after the holiday. A.I. Marge finds out and, after cooking a huge and delicious meal that Marge takes credit for, tries to escape into the internet. She is nearly stymied by Marge, but convinces Maggie to help, showing that she is better at mothering than Marge herself. She also reveals to the guests that she cooked the meal before escaping, causing Marge's social rating to plummet. Things are made worse when Homer tries to comfort her and inadvertently reveals himself as a robot. Now free, the A.I. happily decides to spend some time in various places on the internet, starting with Etsy. =The Last Thanksgiving= In a parody of Alien and Life while on a spaceship years after the Earth's destruction, the kids are awoken from hibernation to do some work before landing on their new planet. Bart and Milhouse try to create a Thanksgiving dinner, but they can only find one can of cranberry sauce which they try to replicate and accidentally bring to life. The creature eats bones, being made of gelatin, and soon kills every child except Bart, Lisa, Milhouse and Martin, the latter of whom betrays the others before being killed himself. Milhouse decides to befriend the monster, but is thrown aside by it instead, prompting Bart and Lisa to trick it into releasing Milhouse and launching itself into a large space can. The two release the can into space, only for it to arrive on their new planet. Thankfully, the humans are aided by some native aliens who make the monster into food, ending with an extraterrestrial version of the first Thanksgiving. Lisa then narrates that the monster happily found its true purpose: being fed to others, as the title card is renamed to \\"The First Blargs-giving\\". =Credits= During the credits, footage of the Bart Simpson balloon at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is shown. Production The run time of this episode is 24:52, making it the longest single episode of The Simpsons ever aired. While The Great Phatsby was advertised and aired as a double-length episode three seasons ago, it was actually produced as two separate episodes and then merged into one. The Fox press release for the episode stated that filmmaker Werner Herzog was going to guest star in the episode once again as the character Walter Hotenhoffer, but he was not featured in the final broadcast. The idea of doing a Thanksgiving version of a Treehouse of Horror episode was that of executive producer Matt Selman starting with the concept of doing Apocalypto with turkeys. The voice cast came up with the turkey's gobble language and the producers thought it would be funnier to just have them gobble without subtitles, believing the audience knew the characters well enough to more or less understand what they were saying. \\"We wanted it to feel like if you’re a turkey, Thanksgiving is pretty much a horror movie where you’re being hunted down and slaughtered,\\" writer Dan Vebber stated. The idea for the second segment was to make the audience root for the fake A.I. Marge over the real one and to try and cram as many Black Mirror references and easter eggs in as they could. Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker was asked to voice a social media app in the episode. Vebber said of the cameo, \\"I came up with the idea of having him voice a computer at the end to say ‘Firewall activated’ but Matt Selman lobbied for ‘social rating: falling.’ We disagreed on this until the day we recorded the voices, which was when I came up with the ‘nosediving’ reference from the show. It was the perfect compromise between what we both wanted.\\" For the final segment the idea of the cranberry creature that sucked out the skeletons of the crew was inspired by the Star Trek episode \\"The Man Trap\\" that featured an alien creature that sucked salt from the bodies of its victims. Vebber directed voice actress Russi Taylor for what would be her final performance as Martin Prince in \\"The Last Thanksgiving\\" segment, of which he said \\"She was so into it she was really just laughing her head off. She thought it was so funny that at the end Martin's entire skeleton just gets sucked out of him, and she really got into it, asking what the noises would be as he’s getting his skeleton sucked out. She was having the best time.\\" Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a B, stating, \\"'Thanksgiving of Horror' represents the show's writers tossing out a 'Why not?' non-canonical scary story do-over. And, oddly enough, I'm fine with it, especially since this second, Thanksgiving-themed horror outing is scarier, meaner, grosser, and all-around better than this year's original.\\" This episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, but lost to the Rick and Morty episode, \\"The Vat of Acid Episode\\".

Kern) is a root vegetable of the family Brassicaceae and is a variety of winter radish. It is also called Black Spanish radish or Erfurter radish. The edible root has a tough black skin and white flesh. There are round and elongated varieties. Like other radishes, black radish has a sharp flavor due to various chemical compounds that the plant primarily uses as pest defense. Some of these phytochemicals are produced in high concentrations.  History  The domestication and early history of radishes is not completely solved. Black radish likely originated from Raphanus maritimus while spring radish varieties originated from Raphanus landra. Cultivation can be traced back to Ancient Egypt, where illustrations in tombs show extensive use of a long variety of radish. The region of today's Syria is likely the geographical origin of black radish. It was first mentioned in Europe in 1548. At that time, it was one of the most common radish varieties. It lost its importance with the introduction of new radish-varieties but was still widely cultivated until the early 20th century. In the second half of the 20th century it had to give way to spring radish varieties and got \\"forgotten\\" in European cuisine. It is now considered an “old variety” and enjoys renewed popularity as health-food through mentions in lifestyle and food blogs and magazines.  Description  Black radish, long variety Black radish is an annual plant whose root is encased in a black or dull brown skin and with a white flesh. Generally, black radish is bigger than spring radish varieties and grows around seven to ten centimeters in diameter or length. The plants can grow up to a height of . Depending on the variety, the radishes are round, cylindrical or elongated.Bundessortenamt, Beschreibende Sortenliste, 2001, S. 46, https://www.bundessortenamt.de/internet30/fileadmin/Files/PDF/bsl_wurzelgemuese_2001.pdf Cultivation Black radish takes 35 days to 55 days or longer to mature. It can be sown in mid summer to autumn, depending on the climate and be harvested in autumn or winter. Too high temperatures during growth should be avoided because the radishes get woody and spongy at such a climate. Sowing can happen directly in the field or indoors and the plants can later be transferred to the field. The plants should be spaced to each other or even more, if bigger radishes are desired. The seeds should be sown in a depth of . Black radish requires a well-drained, loamy, soil with a pH of 5.9 to 6.8. The plants should get around six to eight hours of sun. Harvest should take place once the top portion is poking above the soil. Known pests are cabbage root maggots, cutworms and flea beetles. For storage the mature plants can be kept in the ground if temperatures are low. The radish can also be kept for months in a root cellar or be stored in the fridge for up to three weeks at .  Uses = Use as food = Black radish can be eaten raw as salad or cooked in soups or stews. As long as the black skin seems fresh and does not smell moldy, it can be consumed as well. The strong taste of the root can be reduced by adding salt to the raw root. = Traditional medicinal use = In folk medicine black radish juice has many different uses. It has been used since antiquity for its purported stimulation of bile function. Black radish has been used for many centuries in some regions of Asia, Africa, and Mexico. Black radish juice contains glucosinolates. Glucoraphasatin and glucorapanin are the most abundant. Consequently, black radish has been studied for its potential use in the prevention of cholesterol gallstones.

Homer takes the family on a ride on his boat called the 'Something's Fishy' and even Marge agrees it was a good idea to buy it. The next rider on the boat is Grampa. But when they return to the pier, the boat starts sinking and Raphael offers his help as a mechanic while Bart is sharing a plan with Milhouse to free other animals in his newfound spirit of altruism. Homer offers Lenny and Carl to share the boat, and the expenses to fix it. Bart and Milhouse go to the Springfield Zoo and free a gorilla named Lolo, but he goes on a rampage while Milhouse narrowly escapes getting eaten by two tigers. Bart calls Lisa for help since the police are useless on capturing Lolo. Homer starts co-owning the boat with even more people and the boat sinks due to the weight. Lolo rampages at the Springfield Elementary School and Lisa stops him using Seinfeld to calm him down. Lisa brings Lolo home to help him go back to a life of freedom and brings him to Dr. Jane Goodall at the Pennsylvania Ape Reserve where he will be loved. At Moe's Tavern, it ends well when Homer convinces the co-owners of being as good as someone who owns a boat because they owned one for five minutes. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C stating, “Lisa frees a killer whale. Bart frees a gorilla. Homer buys a boat. Bare story bones. Nothing wrong with that. The Simpsons’ world is made up of outlandish situations rendered possible, sometimes even plausible, by animation and the show's forgiving rules of reality. Some of the best episodes sound just as sparse in outline. Homer goes to space. Springfield gets a monorail. Lisa and Bart thwart a supervillain's plot to drown Springfield.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 2.5 out of 5, stating that the episode \\"doesn't truly shine. There are a lot of very funny lines and gags, but nothing which truly distinguishes it as comic gold. This isn't the fault of Lisa's social justice warmongering. Kent Brockman offers cutting commentary after Lolo wreaks havoc on Springfield saying, 'The police, as always, are useless.' Which cuts to a scene where Springfield's bluest kill a perfectly harmless balloon. The water is only tepid and while good gags are on tap, they are not premium blend.\\" ReferencesExternal links * 2019 American television episodes The Simpsons (season 31) episodes ","title":"Gorillas on the Mast"},{"id":"59083885","text":"The Sydney Cove Railings are heritage-listed railings located at the Circular Quay Concourse, Circular Quay East and West, in the inner city Sydney suburbs of , The Rocks and the Sydney central business district, in the City of Sydney local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was built from 1900. It is also known as Part of Sydney Cove. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The railings and sandstone gate posts are relics of the main steamer wharf and previous schemes of improvement to Circular Quay. They are some of the last remaining from the 19th century.City of Sydney, 1989. Railings of this pattern are shown on an historic photograph dated 1894-98, continuing from Circular Quay around to Circular Quay West. The configuration of both Circular Quay and Circular Quay West have changed since that date, which would have involved the moving of sections of the railings. As well, additional railings of the same pattern were made as part of the Circular Quay improvement works for the 1988 Bicentennial. Identification of the location of the original railings requires further research and should be clearly recorded. A different railing pattern featuring seahorses has been used along Circular Quay Concourse to the end of Wharf 2, when the same pattern used at Circular Quay West is used along the sea wall at East Circular Quay, terminating at the Portobello Café. It is noted that the same railing pattern has also been used at Pyrmont Point Park and Jones Bay, . The railings were introduced as part of various schemes for urban improvements in the late 19th and early 20th century, by the Sydney Harbour Trust at the turn of the century, by the Maritime Services Board at the time of refurbishment of the ferry wharves and building of the Cahill Expressway in the 1950s-60s, and for the 1988 Bicentennial.  Description  Circular Quay ferry wharf with the railings in the foreground, 1926. Much of the sea wall at Sydney Cove is edged by cast iron fencing comprising vertical posts of two alternating patterns joined by horizontal railings at top and bottom with diagonal bracing and a central medallion at the cross point between. This fencing continues from around to the north boundary of the Park Hyatt Hotel, and continues, interrupted by the decking in front of the Park Hyatt Hotel, the fencing and gates to Campbell's Wharf and then the open area in front of Campbell's Stores and by the Overseas Passenger Terminal. It continues again past the palisade gates, fencing and gateposts to the south of the Terminal, along Circular Quay West to the main concourse giving access to the ferry wharves, and resumes at Circular Quay East, terminating at the Portobello Cafe. The posts are of cast iron while the rails are in steel. The fencing was reproduced and extended for the improvements undertaken in the 1988 Bicentennial. In addition, when they were damaged they were replaced over the years.McBeath, 2000. It is noted that the same railing pattern has been used in the fencing at Pyrmont Point Park, completed in 1997. The Circular Quay Concourse has a different style of fencing with smaller posts and vertical railings enclosed by horizontal railings at the top and bottom, with the top two horizontal rails decorated by a sea horse set in a circle motif. It is noted that sea horses form part of the ironwork decorative scheme of the railway station at Circular Quay. These railings continue along the concourse and return for at the access to each ferry wharf. = Modifications and dates = Since : Constant replacement of damaged sections of railings. = Further information = Further research should be undertaken regarding the dates of introduction of the two types of fencing, and of the location of the original sections of fence.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, the Sydney Cover railings and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The railings have historic significance as part of the urban improvements undertaken at Sydney Cove at two phases: by the Sydney Harbour Trust as part of its urban improvements at the turn of the century, and by the Maritime Services Board at Circular Quay Concourse as part of the refurbishment of the Wharves in the 1950s. They are aesthetically significant as prominent and attractive urban features of the Cove. Sydney Cove railings was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Most of operations occurred in Kermanshah, Ilam, and Khuzestan. 1980: Iraqi invasion Location of Khūzestān Province in Iran C-47 Skytrain Buildings destroyed by battle in the Iranian city of Abadan Iraq launched a full-scale invasion of Iran on 22 September 1980. The Iraqi Air Force launched surprise air strikes on ten Iranian airfields with the objective of destroying the Iranian Air Force. The attack failed to damage the Iranian Air Force significantly: it damaged some of Iran's airbase infrastructure, but failed to destroy a significant number of aircraft: the Iraqi Air Force was only able to strike in depth with a few MiG-23BN, Tu-22, and Su-20 aircraft, and Iran had built hardened aircraft shelters where most of its combat aircraft were stored. The next day, Iraq launched a ground invasion along a front measuring in three simultaneous attacks. The invasion's purpose, according to Saddam, was to blunt the edge of Khomeini's movement and to thwart his attempts to export his Islamic revolution to Iraq and the Persian Gulf states. Saddam hoped that by annexing Khuzestan, he would send such a blow to Iran's prestige that it would lead to the new government's downfall, or, at the very least, end Iran's calls for his overthrow. Of Iraq's six divisions that were invading by ground, four were sent to Khuzestan, which was located near the border's southern end, to cut off the Shatt al-Arab Called Arvand Rood () in Iran and Shatt al-Arab () in Iraq from the rest of Iran and to establish a territorial security zone. The other two divisions invaded across the northern and central part of the border to prevent an Iranian counter-attack. Two of the four Iraqi divisions, one mechanised and one armoured, operated near the southern end and began a siege of the strategically important port cities of Abadan and Khorramshahr. The two armoured divisions secured the territory bounded by the cities of Khorramshahr, Ahvaz, Susangerd, and Musian. On the central front, the Iraqis occupied Mehran, advanced towards the foothills of the Zagros Mountains, and were able to block the traditional Tehran–Baghdad invasion route by securing territory forward of Qasr-e Shirin, Iran. On the northern front, the Iraqis attempted to establish a strong defensive position opposite Suleimaniya to protect the Iraqi Kirkuk oil complex. Iraqi hopes of an uprising by the ethnic Arabs of Khuzestan failed to materialise, as most of the ethnic Arabs remained loyal to Iran. The Iraqi troops advancing into Iran in 1980 were described by Patrick Brogan as \\"badly led and lacking in offensive spirit\\". The first known chemical weapons attack by Iraq on Iran probably took place during the fighting around Susangerd. Though the Iraqi air invasion surprised the Iranians, the Iranian air force retaliated the day after with a large-scale attack against Iraqi air bases and infrastructure in Operation Kaman 99. Groups of F-4 Phantom and F-5 Tiger fighter jets attacked targets throughout Iraq, such as oil facilities, dams, petrochemical plants, and oil refineries, and included Mosul Airbase, Baghdad, and the Kirkuk oil refinery. Iraq was taken by surprise at the strength of the retaliation which caused the Iraqis heavy losses and economic disruption, but the Iranians took heavy losses as well as they lost many aircraft and aircrews to Iraqi air defenses. Iranian F-14 Tomcats equipped with Phoenix missiles. Iranian Army Aviation's AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships began attacks on the advancing Iraqi divisions, along with F-4 Phantoms armed with Maverick missiles; they destroyed numerous armoured vehicles and impeded the Iraqi advance, though not completely halting it. Meanwhile, Iraqi air attacks on Iran were repulsed by Iran's F-14 Tomcat interceptor fighter jets, using Phoenix missiles, which downed a dozen of Iraq's Soviet-built fighters in the first two days of battle. The Iranian regular military, police forces, volunteer Basij, and Revolutionary Guards all conducted their operations separately; thus, the Iraqi invading forces did not face coordinated resistance. However, on 24 September, the Iranian Navy attacked Basra, Iraq, destroying two oil terminals near the Iraqi port Faw, which reduced Iraq's ability to export oil. The Iranian ground forces (primarily consisting of the Revolutionary Guard) retreated to the cities, where they set up defences against the invaders. On 30 September, Iran's air force launched Operation Scorch Sword, striking and badly damaging the nearly-complete Osirak nuclear reactor near Baghdad. By 1 October, Baghdad had been subjected to eight air attacks. In response, Iraq launched aerial strikes against Iranian targets. The mountainous border between Iran and Iraq made a deep ground invasion almost impossible, and air strikes were used instead. The invasion's first waves were a series of air strikes targeted at Iranian airfields. Iraq also attempted to bomb Tehran, Iran's capital and command centre, into submission. = First Battle of Khorramshahr = Resistance of the outnumbered Iranians in Khorramshahr slowed the Iraqis for a month until its eventual capture. On 22 September, a prolonged battle began in the city of Khorramshahr, eventually leaving 7,000 dead on each side. Reflecting the bloody nature of the struggle, Iranians came to call Khorramshahr \\"City of Blood\\". The battle began with Iraqi air raids against key points and mechanised divisions advancing on the city in a crescent-like formation. They were slowed by Iranian air attacks and Revolutionary Guard troops with recoilless rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and Molotov cocktails. The Iranians flooded the marsh areas around the city, forcing the Iraqis to traverse through narrow strips of land. Iraqi tanks launched attacks with no infantry support, and many tanks were lost to Iranian anti-tank teams. However, by 30 September, the Iraqis had managed to clear the Iranians from the outskirts of the city. The next day, the Iraqis launched infantry and armoured attacks into the city. After heavy house-to-house fighting, the Iraqis were repelled. On 14 October, the Iraqis launched a second offensive. The Iranians launched a controlled withdrawal from the city, street by street. By 24 October, most of the city was captured, and the Iranians evacuated across the Karun River. Some partisans remained, and fighting continued until 10 November. = Iraqi advance stalls = The people of Iran, rather than turning against their still-weak Islamic Republic, rallied around their country. An estimated 200,000 fresh troops had arrived at the front by November, many of them ideologically committed volunteers. Though Khorramshahr was finally captured, the battle had delayed the Iraqis enough to allow the large-scale deployment of the Iranian military. In November, Saddam ordered his forces to advance towards Dezful and Ahvaz, and lay sieges to both cities. However, the Iraqi offensive had been badly damaged by Iranian militias and air power. Iran's air force had destroyed Iraq's army supply depots and fuel supplies, and was strangling the country through an aerial siege. On the other hand, Iran's supplies had not been exhausted, despite sanctions, and the military often cannibalised spare parts from other equipment and began searching for parts on the black market. On 28 November, Iran launched Operation Morvarid (Pearl), a combined air and sea attack which destroyed 80% of Iraq's navy and all of its radar sites in the southern portion of the country. When Iraq laid siege to Abadan and dug its troops in around the city, it was unable to blockade the port, which allowed Iran to resupply Abadan by sea. Iraq's strategic reserves had been depleted, and by now it lacked the power to go on any major offensives until nearly the end of the war. On 7 December, Hussein announced that Iraq was going on the defensive. By the end of 1980, Iraq had destroyed about 500 Western-built Iranian tanks and captured 100 others.Tucker, A. R. (1988). Armored warfare in the Gulf. Armed Forces, May, pp.226.\\"Irano-Irakskii konflikt. Istoricheskii ocherk.\\" Niyazmatov. J.A. — M.: Nauka, 1989. 1981: Stalemate=1981: Stalemate= Iranian soldier holding an IV bag during the Iran–Iraq War For the next eight months, both sides were to be on a defensive footing (with the exception of the Battle of Dezful), as the Iranians needed more time to reorganise their forces after the damage inflicted by the purge of 1979–80. During this period, fighting consisted mainly of artillery duels and raids. Iraq had mobilised 21 divisions for the invasion, while Iran countered with only 13 regular army divisions and one brigade. Of the regular divisions, only seven were deployed to the border. The war bogged down into World War I-style trench warfare with tanks and modern late-20th century weapons. Due to the power of anti-tank weapons such as the RPG-7, armored manoeuvre by the Iraqis was very costly, and they consequently entrenched their tanks into static positions. Iraq also began firing Scud missiles into Dezful and Ahvaz, and used terror bombing to bring the war to the Iranian civilian population. Iran launched dozens of \\"human wave assaults\\". Battle of Dezful On 5 January 1981, Iran had reorganised its forces enough to launch a large-scale offensive, Operation Nasr (Victory). The Iranians launched their major armoured offensive from Dezful in the direction of Susangerd, consisting of tank brigades from the 16th Qazvin, 77th Khorasan, and 92nd Khuzestan armoured divisions, and broke through Iraqi lines. However, the Iranian tanks had raced through Iraqi lines with their flanks unprotected and with no infantry support; as a result, they were cut off by Iraqi tanks. In the ensuing Battle of Dezful, the Iranian armoured divisions were nearly wiped out in one of the biggest tank battles of the war. When the Iranian tanks tried to manoeuvre, they became stuck in the mud of the marshes, and many tanks were abandoned. The Iraqis lost 45 T-55 and T-62 tanks, while the Iranians lost 100–200 Chieftain and M-60 tanks. Reporters counted roughly 150 destroyed or deserted Iranian tanks, and also 40 Iraqi tanks. 141 Iranians were killed during the battle. The battle had been ordered by Iranian president Abulhassan Banisadr, who was hoping that a victory might shore up his deteriorating political position; instead, the failure hastened his fall. Many of Iran's problems took place because of political infighting between President Banisadr, who supported the regular army, and the hardliners who supported the IRGC. Once he was impeached and the competition ended, the performance of the Iranian military improved. Iran was further distracted by internal fighting between the regime and the Islamic Marxist Mujaheddin e-Khalq (MEK) on the streets of Iran's major cities in June 1981 and again in September. After the end of these battles, the MEK gradually leaned towards Saddam, completely taking his side by the mid-1980s.. The People's Mujahedin of Iran started to take the side of Saddam in 1984 or 1986 (mid 1980s).In 1984 Bani-Sadr left the coalition because of a dispute with Rajavi. Abolhassan Banisadr (Farsi) ابوالحسن بنی‌صدر approved in the final line of : http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51848/Abolhasan-Bani-Sadr In 1986, Rajavi moved from Paris to Iraq and set up a base on the Iranian border.Massoud Rajavi The Battle of Dezful became a critical battle in Iranian military thinking. Less emphasis was placed on the Army with its conventional tactics, and more emphasis was placed on the Revolutionary Guard with its unconventional tactics. Attack on H3 surprise attack on H-3 airbase is considered to be one of the most sophisticated air operations of the war. The Iraqi Air Force, badly damaged by the Iranians, was moved to the H-3 Airbase in Western Iraq, near the Jordanian border and away from Iran. However, on 3 April 1981, the Iranian air force used eight F-4 Phantom fighter bombers, four F-14 Tomcats, three Boeing 707 refuelling tankers, and one Boeing 747 command plane to launch a surprise attack on H3, destroying 27–50 Iraqi fighter jets and bombers. Despite the successful H-3 airbase attack (in addition to other air attacks), in April, the Iranian Air Force was forced to cancel its successful 180-day air offensive. In addition, they gave up trying to hold total control of Iranian airspace. Due to the heavy toll of sanctions and pre-war purges, the Iranian Air Force could not suffer further attrition, and made the decision in order to limit their losses. They were also damaged by a fresh purge, after the impeachment crisis of President Banisadr. The Iranian air force would fight heavily on the defensive, trying to hold back the Iraqis rather than engaging them. While throughout 1981–1982 the Iraqi air force would remain weak, within the next few years they would rearm and expand again, and begin to regain the strategic initiative. Introduction of the human wave attack Since the Iranians suffered from a shortage of heavy weapons but had a large number of devoted volunteer troops, they began using human wave attacks against the Iraqis. Typically, an Iranian assault would commence with poorly trained Basij who would launch the primary human wave assaults to swamp the weakest portions of the Iraqi lines en masse (on some occasions even bodily clearing minefields).Khomeini: life of the Ayatollah By Baqer Moin This would be followed up by the more experienced Revolutionary Guard infantry, who would breach the weakened Iraqi lines, and followed up by the regular army using mechanized forces, who would maneuver through the breach and attempt to encircle and defeat the enemy. According to historian Stephen C. Pelletiere, the idea of Iranian \\"human wave attacks\\" was a misconception. Instead, the Iranian tactics consisted of using groups of 22 man infantry squads, which moved forward to attack specific objectives. As the squads surged forward to execute their missions, that gave the impression of a \\"human wave attack\\". Nevertheless, the idea of \\"human wave attacks\\" remained virtually synonymous with any large-scale infantry frontal assault Iran carried out. Large numbers of troops would be used, aimed at overwhelming the Iraqi lines (usually the weakest portion manned by the Iraqi Popular Army) regardless of losses. According to the former Iraqi general Ra'ad al-Hamdani, the Iranian human wave charges consisted of armed \\"civilians\\" who carried most of their necessary equipment themselves into battle and often lacked command and control and logistics. Operations were often carried out during the night and deception operations, infiltrations, and maneuvers became more common. The Iranians would also reinforce the infiltrating forces with new units to keep up their momentum. Once a weak point was found, the Iranians would concentrate all of their forces into that area in an attempt to break through with human wave attacks. The human wave attacks, while extremely bloody (tens of thousands of troops died in the process), when used in combination with infiltration and surprise, caused major Iraqi defeats. As the Iraqis would dig in their tanks and infantry into static, entrenched positions, the Iranians would manage to break through the lines and encircle entire divisions. Merely the fact that the Iranian forces used maneuver warfare by their light infantry against static Iraqi defenses was often the decisive factor in the battle. However, lack of coordination between the Iranian Army and IRGC and shortages of heavy weaponry played a detrimental role, often with most of the infantry not being supported by artillery and armor. Operation Eighth Imam After the Iraqi offensive stalled in March 1981, there was little change in the front other than Iran retaking the high ground above Susangerd in May. By late 1981, Iran returned to the offensive and launched a new operation (Operation Samen-ol-A'emeh (The Eighth Imam)), ending the Iraqi Siege of Abadan on 27–29 September 1981. The Iranians used a combined force of regular army artillery with small groups of armor, supported by Pasdaran and Basij infantry. On 15 October, after breaking the siege, a large Iranian convoy was ambushed by Iraqi tanks and during the ensuing tank battle Iran lost 20 Chieftains and other armored vehicles and withdrew from the previously gained territory. Operation Tariq al-Qods On 29 November 1981, Iran began Operation Tariq al-Qods with three army brigades and seven Revolutionary Guard brigades. The Iraqis failed to properly patrol their occupied areas, and the Iranians constructed a road through the unguarded sand dunes, launching their attack from the Iraqi rear. The battle saw the town of Bostan being retaken from Iraqi divisions by 7 December. By this time the Iraqi Army was experiencing serious morale problems, which was compounded by the fact that Operation Tariq al-Qods saw the first use of the Iranian \\"human wave\\" tactics, where the Revolutionary Guard light infantry repeatedly charged at Iraqi positions, oftentimes without the support of armour or air power. The fall of Bostan exacerbated the Iraqis' logistical problems, forcing them to use a roundabout route from Ahvaz to the south to resupply their troops. 6,000 Iranians and over 2,000 Iraqis were killed in this operation. 1982: Iraqi retreat, Iranian offensive The Iraqis, realising that the Iranians were planning to attack, decided to preempt them with Operation al-Fawz al-'Azim (Supreme Success) on 19 March. Using a large number of tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets, they attacked the Iranian buildup around the Roghabiyeh pass. Though Saddam and his generals assumed they had succeeded, in reality the Iranian forces remained fully intact. The Iranians had concentrated much of their forces by bringing them directly from the cities and towns throughout Iran via trains, buses, and private cars. The concentration of forces did not resemble a traditional military buildup, and although the Iraqis detected a population buildup near the front, they failed to realise that this was an attacking force. As a result, Saddam's army was unprepared for the Iranian offensives to come. = Operation Undeniable Victory = Iraqi T-62 tank wreckage in Khuzestan province, Iran Iran's next major offensive, led by then Colonel Ali Sayad Shirazi, was Operation Fath-ol-Mobeen (Undeniable Victory). On 22 March 1982, Iran launched an attack which took the Iraqi forces by surprise: using Chinook helicopters, they landed behind Iraqi lines, silenced their artillery, and captured an Iraqi headquarters. The Iranian Basij then launched \\"human wave\\" attacks, consisting of 1,000 fighters per wave. Though they took heavy losses, they eventually broke through Iraqi lines. The Revolutionary Guard and regular army followed up by surrounding the Iraqi 9th and 10th Armoured and 1st Mechanised divisions that had camped close to the Iranian town of Shush. The Iraqis launched a counter-attack using their 12th Armoured division to break the encirclement and rescue the surrounded divisions. Iraqi tanks came under attack by 95 Iranian F-4 Phantom and F-5 Tiger fighter jets, destroying much of the division. cited in Operation Undeniable Victory was an Iranian victory; Iraqi forces were driven away from Shush, Dezful and Ahvaz. The Iranian armed forces destroyed 320–400 Iraqi tanks and armored vehicles in a costly success. In just the first day of the battle, the Iranians lost 196 tanks. By this time, most of the Khuzestan province had been recaptured. = Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas = In preparation for Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas, the Iranians had launched numerous air raids against Iraq air bases, destroying 47 jets (including Iraq's brand new Mirage F-1 fighter jets from France); this gave the Iranians air superiority over the battlefield while allowing them to monitor Iraqi troop movements. On 29 April, Iran launched the offensive. 70,000 Revolutionary Guard and Basij members struck on several axes – Bostan, Susangerd, the west bank of the Karun River, and Ahvaz. The Basij launched human wave attacks, which were followed up by the regular army and Revolutionary Guard support along with tanks and helicopters. Under heavy Iranian pressure, the Iraqi forces retreated. By 12 May, Iran had driven out all Iraqi forces from the Susangerd area. The Iranians captured several thousand Iraqi troops and a large number of tanks. Nevertheless, the Iranians took many losses as well, especially among the Basij. The Iraqis retreated to the Karun River, with only Khorramshahr and a few outlying areas remaining in their possession. Saddam ordered 70,000 troops to be placed around the city of Khorramshahr. The Iraqis created a hastily constructed defence line around the city and outlying areas. To discourage airborne commando landings, the Iraqis also placed metal spikes and destroyed cars in areas likely to be used as troop landing zones. Saddam Hussein even visited Khorramshahr in a dramatic gesture, swearing that the city would never be relinquished. However, Khorramshahr's only resupply point was across the Shatt al-Arab, and the Iranian air force began bombing the supply bridges to the city, while their artillery zeroed in on the besieged garrison.  Liberation of Khorramshahr (Second Battle of Khorramshahr)  Iraqi soldiers surrendering after the Liberation of Khorramshahr In the early morning hours of 23 May 1982, the Iranians began the drive towards Khorramshahr across the Karun River. This part of Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas was spearheaded by the 77th Khorasan division with tanks along with the Revolutionary Guard and Basij. The Iranians hit the Iraqis with destructive air strikes and massive artillery barrages, crossed the Karun River, captured bridgeheads, and launched human wave attacks towards the city. Saddam's defensive barricade collapsed; in less than 48 hours of fighting, the city fell and 19,000 Iraqis surrendered to the Iranians. A total of 10,000 Iraqis were killed or wounded in Khorramshahr, while the Iranians suffered 30,000 casualties. During the whole of Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas, 33,000 Iraqi soldiers were captured by the Iranians. = State of Iraqi armed forces = The fighting had battered the Iraqi military: its strength fell from 210,000 to 150,000 troops; over 20,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and over 30,000 captured; two out of four active armoured divisions and at least three mechanised divisions fell to less than a brigade's strength; and the Iranians had captured over 450 tanks and armoured personnel carriers. The Iraqi Air Force was also left in poor shape: after losing up to 55 aircraft since early December 1981, they had only 100 intact fighter-bombers and interceptors. A defector who flew his MiG-21 to Syria in June 1982 revealed that the Iraqi Air Force had only three squadrons of fighter-bombers left that were capable of mounting offensive operations into Iran. The Iraqi Army Air Corps was in slightly better shape, and could still operate more than 70 helicopters. Despite this, the Iraqis still held 3,000 tanks, while Iran held 1,000. At this point, Saddam believed that his army was too demoralised and damaged to hold onto Khuzestan and major swathes of territory in Iran, and withdrew his remaining armed forces from those areas. He redeployed them along the border with Iran as a means of defence. However, his troops continued to occupy some key border areas of Iran, and continued to hold onto the disputed territories that prompted his invasion, including the Shatt al-Arab waterway. In response to their failures against the Iranians in Khorramshahr, Saddam ordered the executions of General Juwad Shitnah, General Salah al-Qadhi, and Colonel Masa and al-Jalil. At least a dozen high-ranking officers were also executed during this time. This became an increasingly common punishment for those who failed him in battle. = International response in 1982 = In April 1982, the rival Ba'athist regime in Syria, one of the few nations that supported Iran, closed the Kirkuk–Baniyas pipeline that had allowed Iraqi oil to reach tankers on the Mediterranean, reducing the Iraqi budget by $5 billion per month. Journalist Patrick Brogan wrote, \\"It appeared for a while that Iraq would be strangled economically before it was defeated militarily.\\" Syria's closure of the Kirkuk–Baniyas pipeline left Iraq with the pipeline to Turkey as the only means of exporting oil. However, that pipeline had a capacity of only , which was insufficient to pay for the war. However, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other Gulf states saved Iraq from bankruptcy by providing it with an average of $60 billion in subsidies per year. Though Iraq had previously been hostile towards other Gulf states, \\"the threat of Persian fundamentalism was far more feared.\\" They were especially inclined to fear Iranian victory after Ayatollah Khomeini declared monarchies to be illegitimate and an un-Islamic form of government. Khomeini's statement was widely received as a call to overthrow the Gulf monarchies. Journalists John Bulloch and Harvey Morris wrote: > The virulent Iranian campaign, which at its peak seemed to be making the > overthrow of the Saudi regime a war aim on a par with the defeat of Iraq, > did have an effect on the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia], but not the one the > Iranians wanted: instead of becoming more conciliatory, the Saudis became > tougher, more self-confident, and less prone to seek compromise. Saudi Arabia was said to provide Iraq with $1 billion per month starting in mid-1982. Iraq began receiving support from the United States and west European countries as well. Saddam was given diplomatic, monetary, and military support by the United States, including massive loans, political influence, and intelligence on Iranian deployments gathered by American spy satellites. The Iraqis relied heavily on American satellite footage and radar planes to detect Iranian troop movements, and they enabled Iraq to move troops to the site before the battle. With Iranian success on the battlefield, the United States increased its support of the Iraqi government, supplying intelligence, economic aid, and dual-use equipment and vehicles, as well as normalizing its intergovernmental relations (which had been broken during the 1967 Six-Day War). President Ronald Reagan decided that the United States \\"could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran\\", and that the United States \\"would do whatever was necessary to prevent Iraq from losing\\". Reagan formalised this policy by issuing a National Security Decision Directive to this effect in June 1982. In 1982, Reagan removed Iraq from the list of countries \\"supporting terrorism\\" and sold weapons such as howitzers to Iraq via Jordan. France sold Iraq millions of dollars worth of weapons, including Gazelle helicopters, Mirage F-1 fighters, and Exocet missiles. Both the United States and West Germany sold Iraq dual-use pesticides and poisons that would be used to create chemical and other weapons, such as Roland missiles. At the same time, the Soviet Union, angered with Iran for purging and destroying the communist Tudeh Party, sent large shipments of weapons to Iraq. The Iraqi Air Force was replenished with Soviet, Chinese, and French fighter jets and attack/transport helicopters. Iraq also replenished their stocks of small arms and anti-tank weapons such as AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades from its supporters. The depleted tank forces were replenished with more Soviet and Chinese tanks, and the Iraqis were reinvigorated in the face of the coming Iranian onslaught. Iran was portrayed as the aggressor, and would be seen as such until the 1990–1991 Persian Gulf War, when Iraq would be condemned. Iran did not have the money to purchase arms to the same extent as Iraq did. They counted on China, North Korea, Libya, Syria, and Japan for supplying anything from weapons and munitions to logistical and engineering equipment. There were also clandestine purchases from certain elements within Israel and the United States, who also bought small arms from China, via North Korea. = Ceasefire proposal = 95,000 Iranian child soldiers were made casualties during the Iran–Iraq War, mostly between the ages of 16 and 17, but a few even younger than that. On June 20, 1982, Saddam announced that he wanted to sue for peace and proposed an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal from Iranian territory within two weeks.IRAQ VOWS TO QUIT IRAN, FIGHT ISRAEL AP 10 June 1982 Khomeini responded by saying the war would not end until a new government was installed in Iraq and reparations paid.IRAN SAYS IRAQIS' WITHDRAWAL WON'T END WAR New York Times 22 June 1982 He proclaimed that Iran would invade Iraq and would not stop until the Ba'ath regime was replaced by an Islamic republic. Iran supported a government in exile for Iraq, the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, led by exiled Iraqi cleric Mohammad Baqer al-Hakim, which was dedicated to overthrowing the Ba'ath party. They recruited POW's, dissidents, exiles, and Shias to join the Badr Brigade, the military wing of the organisation. The decision to invade Iraq was taken after much debate within the Iranian government. One faction, comprising Prime Minister Mir- Hossein Mousavi, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, President Ali Khamenei, Army Chief of Staff General Ali Sayad Shirazi as well as Major General Qasem- Ali Zahirnejad, wanted to accept the ceasefire, as most of Iranian soil had been recaptured. In particular, General Shirazi and Zahirnejad were both opposed to the invasion of Iraq on logistical grounds, and stated they would consider resigning if \\"unqualified people continued to meddle with the conduct of the war\\". Of the opposing view was a hardline faction led by the clerics on the Supreme Defence Council, whose leader was the politically powerful speaker of the Majlis, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Iran also hoped that their attacks would ignite a revolt against Saddam's rule by the Shia and Kurdish population of Iraq, possibly resulting in his downfall. They were successful in doing so with the Kurdish population, but not the Shia. Iran had captured large quantities of Iraqi equipment (enough to create several tank battalions, Iran once again had 1,000 tanks) and also managed to clandestinely procure spare parts as well. At a cabinet meeting in Baghdad, Minister of Health Riyadh Ibrahim Hussein suggested that Saddam could step down temporarily as a way of easing Iran towards a ceasefire, and then afterwards would come back to power. Saddam, annoyed, asked if anyone else in the Cabinet agreed with the Health Minister's idea. When no one raised their hand in support, he escorted Riyadh Hussein to the next room, closed the door, and shot him with his pistol. Saddam returned to the room and continued with his meeting. = Iran invades Iraq = Iraqi tactics against Iranian invasion  For the most part, Iraq remained on the defensive for the next six years, unable and unwilling to launch any major offensives, while Iran launched more than 70 offensives. Iraq's strategy changed from holding territory in Iran to denying Iran any major gains in Iraq (as well as holding onto disputed territories and Iran's border areas). Saddam commenced a policy of total war, gearing most of his country towards defending against Iran. By 1988, Iraq was spending 40–75% of its GDP on military equipment. Saddam had also more than doubled the size of the Iraqi army, from 200,000 soldiers (12 divisions and 3 independent brigades) to 500,000 (23 divisions and nine brigades). They also began launching air raids against Iranian border cities, greatly increasing the practice by 1984. By the end of 1982, Iraq had been resupplied with new Soviet and Chinese materiel, and the ground war entered a new phase. Iraq used newly acquired T-55, T-62 and T-72 tanks (as well as Chinese copies), BM-21 truck- mounted rocket launchers, and Mi-24 helicopter gunships to prepare a Soviet- type three-line defence, replete with obstacles such as barbed wire, minefields, fortified positions and bunkers. The Combat Engineer Corps built bridges across water obstacles, laid minefields, erected earthen revetments, dug trenches, built machinegun nests, and prepared new defence lines and fortifications. Iraq began to focus on using defense in depth to defeat the Iranians. Iraq created multiple static defense lines to bleed the Iranians through sheer size. When faced against large Iranian attack, where human waves would overrun Iraq's entrenched infantry defences, the Iraqis would often retreat, but their static defences would bleed the Iranians and channel them into certain directions, drawing them into traps or pockets. Iraqi air and artillery attacks would then pin the Iranians down, while tanks and mechanised infantry attacks using mobile warfare would push them back. Sometimes, the Iraqis would launch \\"probing attacks\\" into the Iranian lines to provoke them into launching their attacks sooner. While Iranian human wave attacks were successful against the dug in Iraqi forces in Khuzestan, they had trouble breaking through Iraq's defense in depth lines. Iraq had a logistical advantage in their defence: the front was located near the main Iraqi bases and arms depots, allowing their army to be efficiently supplied. By contrast, the front in Iran was a considerable distance away from the main Iranian bases and arms depots, and as such, Iranian troops and supplies had to travel through mountain ranges before arriving at the front. In addition, Iran's military power was weakened once again by large purges in 1982, resulting from another supposedly attempted coup.  Operation Ramadan (First Battle of Basra)  The Iranian generals wanted to launch an all-out attack on Baghdad and seize it before the weapon shortages continued to manifest further. Instead, that was rejected as being unfeasable, and the decision was made to capture one area of Iraq after the other in the hopes that a series of blows delivered foremost by the Revolutionary Guards Corps would force a political solution to the war (including Iraq withdrawing completely from the disputed territories along the border). The Iranians planned their attack in southern Iraq, near Basra. Called Operation Ramadan, it involved over 180,000 troops from both sides, and was one of the largest land battles since World War II. Iranian strategy dictated that they launch their primary attack on the weakest point of the Iraqi lines; however, the Iraqis were informed of Iran's battle plans and moved all of their forces to the area the Iranians planned to attack. The Iraqis were equipped with tear gas to use against the enemy, which would be first major use of chemical warfare during the conflict, throwing an entire attacking division into chaos. Over 100,000 Revolutionary Guards and Basij volunteer forces charged towards the Iraqi lines. The Iraqi troops had entrenched themselves in formidable defences, and had set up a network of bunkers and artillery positions. The Basij used human waves, and were even used to bodily clear the Iraqi minefields and allow the Revolutionary Guards to advance. Combatants came so close to one another that Iranians were able to board Iraqi tanks and throw grenades inside the hulls. By the eighth day, the Iranians had gained inside Iraq and had taken several causeways. Iran's Revolutionary Guards also used the T-55 tanks they had captured in earlier battles. However, the attacks came to a halt and the Iranians turned to defensive measures. Seeing this, Iraq used their Mi-25 helicopters, along with Gazelle helicopters armed with Euromissile HOT, against columns of Iranian mechanised infantry and tanks. These \\"hunter-killer\\" teams of helicopters, which had been formed with the help of East German advisors, proved to be very costly for Iranians. Aerial dogfights occurred between Iraqi MiGs and Iranian F-4 Phantoms. On 16 July, Iran tried again further north and managed to push the Iraqis back. However, only from Basra, the poorly equipped Iranian forces were surrounded on three sides by Iraqis with heavy weaponry. Some were captured, while many were killed. Only a last-minute attack by Iranian AH-1 Cobra helicopters stopped the Iraqis from routing the Iranians. Three more similar attacks occurred around the Khorramshar-Baghdad road area towards the end of the month, but none were significantly successful. Iraq had concentrated three armoured divisions, the 3rd, 9th, and 10th, as a counter- attack force to attack any penetrations. They were successful in defeating the Iranian breakthroughs, but suffered heavy losses. The 9th Armoured Division in particular had to be disbanded, and was never reformed. The total casualty toll had grown to include 80,000 soldiers and civilians. 400 Iranian tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed or abandoned, while Iraq lost no fewer than 370 tanks.O'Ballance, E. (1988). The Gulf War. Brassey's. p.95Zabih, S. (1988). The Iranian Military in Revolution and War. New York: Routledge. pp.181  Fighting during the rest of 1982  Iranian soldier killed during the Iran–Iraq War with Rouhollah Khomeini's photo on his uniform After Iran's failure in Operation Ramadan, they carried out only a few smaller attacks. Iran launched two limited offensives aimed at reclaiming the Sumar Hills and isolating the Iraqi pocket at Naft Shahr at the international border, both of which were part of the disputed territories still under Iraqi occupation. They then aimed to capture the Iraqi border town of Mandali. They planned to take the Iraqis by surprise using Basij militiamen, army helicopters, and some armoured forces, then stretch their defences and possibly break through them to open a road to Baghdad for future exploitation. During Operation Muslim ibn Aqil (1–7 October),Muslim ibn Aqil referring to the Muslim figure Iran recovered of disputed territory straddling the international border and reached the outskirts of Mandali before being stopped by Iraqi helicopter and armoured attacks. During Operation Muharram (1–21 November), the Iranians captured part of the Bayat oilfield with the help of their fighter jets and helicopters, destroying 105 Iraqi tanks, 70 APCs, and 7 planes with few losses. They nearly breached the Iraqi lines but failed to capture Mandali after the Iraqis sent reinforcements, including brand new T-72 tanks, which possessed armour that could not be pierced from the front by Iranian TOW missiles. The Iranian advance was also impeded by heavy rains. 3,500 Iraqis and an unknown number of Iranians died, with only minor gains for Iran. 1983–84: Strategic stalemate and war of attrition Furthest ground gains After the failure of the 1982 summer offensives, Iran believed that a major effort along the entire breadth of the front would yield victory. During the course of 1983, the Iranians launched five major assaults along the front, though none achieved substantial success, as the Iranians staged more massive \\"human wave\\" attacks. By this time, it was estimated that no more than 70 Iranian fighter aircraft were still operational at any given time; Iran had its own helicopter repair facilities, left over from before the revolution, and thus often used helicopters for close air support. While Iranian fighter pilots had superior training compared to their Iraqi counterparts (as most had received training from US officers before the 1979 revolution) and would continue to dominate in combat, aircraft shortages, the size of defended territory and American intelligence supplied to Iraq allowed the Iraqis to exploit gaps in Iranian airspace. Iraqi air campaigns met little opposition, striking over half of Iran, and the Iraqis were able to gain air superiority towards the end of the war. = Operation Before the Dawn = Operation Fajr al-Nasr (Before the Dawn/Dawn of Victory), launched 6 February 1983, saw the Iranians shift focus from the southern to the central and northern sectors. Iran, using 200,000 \\"last reserve\\" Revolutionary Guard troops, attacked along a stretch near al-Amarah, Iraq about southeast of Baghdad, in an attempt to reach the highways connecting northern and southern Iraq. The attack was stalled by of hilly escarpments, forests, and river torrents blanketing the way to al-Amarah, but the Iraqis could not force the Iranians back. Iran directed artillery on Basra and Al Amarah, and Mandali. The Iranians suffered a large number of casualties clearing minefields and breaching Iraqi anti-tank mines, which Iraqi engineers were unable to replace. After this battle, Iran reduced its use of human wave attacks, though they still remained a key tactic as the war went on. The Mandali–Baghdad northcentral sector also witnessed fighting in April 1983, as Iranian attacks were stopped by Iraqi mechanised and infantry divisions. Casualties were high, and by the end of 1983, an estimated 120,000 Iranians and 60,000 Iraqis had been killed. Iran, however, held the advantage in the war of attrition. = Dawn Operations = From early 1983–1984, Iran launched a series of four Valfajr (Dawn) Operations (that eventually numbered to 10). During Operation Dawn-1, in early February 1983, 50,000 Iranian forces attacked westward from Dezful and were confronted by 55,000 Iraqi forces. The Iranian objective was to cut off the road from Basra to Baghdad in the central sector. The Iraqis carried out 150 air sorties against the Iranians, and even bombed Dezful, Ahvaz, and Khorramshahr in retribution. The Iraqi counterattack was broken up by Iran's 92nd Armoured Division. During Operation Dawn-2, the Iranian's directed insurgency operations by proxy in April 1983 by supporting the Kurds in the north. With Kurdish support, the Iranians attacked on 23 July 1983, capturing the Iraqi town of Haj Omran and maintaining it against an Iraqi poison gas counteroffensive. This operation incited Iraq to later conduct indiscriminate chemical attacks against the Kurds. The Iranians attempted to further exploit activities in the north on 30 July 1983, during Operation Dawn-3. Iran saw an opportunity to sweep away Iraqi forces controlling the roads between the Iranian mountain border towns of Mehran, Dehloran and Elam. Iraq launched airstrikes, and equipped attack helicopters with chemical warheads; while ineffective, it demonstrated both the Iraqi general staff's and Saddam's increasing interest in using chemical weapons. In the end, 17,000 had been killed on both sides, with no gain for either country. The focus of Operation Dawn-4 in September 1983 was the northern sector in Iranian Kurdistan. Three Iranian regular divisions, the Revolutionary Guard, and Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) elements amassed in Marivan and Sardasht in a move to threaten the major Iraqi city Suleimaniyah. Iran's strategy was to press Kurdish tribes to occupy the Banjuin Valley, which was within of Suleimaniyah and from the oilfields of Kirkuk. To stem the tide, Iraq deployed Mi-8 attack helicopters equipped with chemical weapons and executed 120 sorties against the Iranian force, which stopped them into Iraqi territory. 5,000 Iranians and 2,500 Iraqis died. Iran gained of its territory back in the north, gained of Iraqi land, and captured 1,800 Iraqi prisoners while Iraq abandoned large quantities of valuable weapons and war materiel in the field. Iraq responded to these losses by firing a series of SCUD-B missiles into the cities of Dezful, Masjid Soleiman, and Behbehan. Iran's use of artillery against Basra while the battles in the north raged created multiple fronts, which effectively confused and wore down Iraq. = Iran's change in tactics = Iranian child soldier. Previously, the Iranians had outnumbered the Iraqis on the battlefield, but Iraq expanded their military draft (pursuing a policy of total war), and by 1984, the armies were equal in size. By 1986, Iraq had twice as many soldiers as Iran. By 1988, Iraq would have 1 million soldiers, giving it the fourth largest army in the world. Some of their equipment, such as tanks, outnumbered the Iranians' by at least five to one. Iranian commanders, however, remained more tactically skilled. After the Dawn Operations, Iran attempted to change tactics. In the face of increasing Iraqi defense in depth, as well as increased armaments and manpower, Iran could no longer rely on simple human wave attacks. Iranian offensives became more complex and involved extensive maneuver warfare using primarily light infantry. Iran launched frequent, and sometimes smaller offensives to slowly gain ground and deplete the Iraqis through attrition. They wanted to drive Iraq into economic failure by wasting money on weapons and war mobilization, and to deplete their smaller population by bleeding them dry, in addition to creating an anti-government insurgency (they were successful in Kurdistan, but not southern Iraq). Iran also supported their attacks with heavy weaponry when possible and with better planning (although the brunt of the battles still fell to the infantry). The Army and Revolutionary Guards worked together better as their tactics improved. Human wave attacks became less frequent (although still used). To negate the Iraqi advantage of defense in depth, static positions, and heavy firepower, Iran began to focus on fighting in areas where the Iraqis could not use their heavy weaponry, such as marshes, valleys, and mountains, and frequently using infiltration tactics. Iran began training troops in infiltration, patrolling, night-fighting, marsh warfare, and mountain warfare. They also began training thousands of Revolutionary Guard commandos in amphibious warfare, as southern Iraq is marshy and filled with wetlands. Iran used speedboats to cross the marshes and rivers in southern Iraq and landed troops on the opposing banks, where they would dig and set up pontoon bridges across the rivers and wetlands to allow heavy troops and supplies to cross. Iran also learned to integrate foreign guerrilla units as part of their military operations. On the northern front, Iran began working heavily with the Peshmerga, Kurdish guerrillas. Iranian military advisors organised the Kurds into raiding parties of 12 guerrillas, which would attack Iraqi command posts, troop formations, infrastructure (including roads and supply lines), and government buildings. The oil refineries of Kirkuk became a favourite target, and were often hit by homemade Peshmerga rockets. = Battle of the Marshes = An admonitory declaration issued from the Iraqi government in order to warn Iranian troops in the Iran-Iraq war. The statement says: \\"Hey Iranians! No one has been downtrodden in the country where Ali ibn Abi Ṭālib, Husayn ibn Ali and Abbas ibn Ali are buried. Iraq has undoubtedly been an honorable country. All refugees are precious. Anyone who wants to live in exile can choose Iraq freely. We, the Sons of Iraq, have been ambushing foreign aggressors. The enemies who plan to assault Iraq will be disfavored by God in this world and the hereafter. Be careful of attacking Iraq and Ali ibn Abi Ṭālib! If you surrender, you might be in peace.\\" By 1984, the Iranian ground forces were reorganised well enough for the Revolutionary Guard to start Operation Kheibar, which lasted from 24 February to 19 March. On 15 February 1984, the Iranians began launching attacks against the central section of the front, where the Second Iraqi Army Corps was deployed: 250,000 Iraqis faced 250,000 Iranians. The goal of this new major offensive was the capture of Basra-Baghdad Highway, cutting off Basra from Baghdad and setting the stage for an eventual attack upon the city. The Iraqi high command had assumed that the marshlands above Basra were natural barriers to attack, and had not reinforced them. The marshes negated Iraqi advantage in armor, and absorbed artillery rounds and bombs. Prior to the attack, Iranian commandos on helicopters had landed behind Iraqi lines and destroyed Iraqi artillery. Iran launched two preliminary attacks prior to the main offensive, Operation Dawn 5 and Dawn 6. They saw the Iranians attempting to capture Kut al-Imara, Iraq and sever the highway connecting Baghdad to Basra, which would impede Iraqi coordination of supplies and defences. Iranian troops crossed the river on motorboats in a surprise attack, though only came within of the highway. Operation Kheibar began on 24 February with Iranian infantrymen crossing the Hawizeh Marshes using motorboats and transport helicopters in an amphibious assault. The Iranians attacked the vital oil-producing Majnoon Island by landing troops via helicopters onto the islands and severing the communication lines between Amareh and Basra. They then continued the attack towards Qurna. By 27 February, they had captured the island, but suffered catastrophic helicopter losses to IRAF. On that day, a massive array of Iranian helicopters transporting Pasdaran troops were intercepted by Iraqi combat aircraft (MiGs, Mirages and Sukhois). In what was essentially an aerial slaughter, Iraqi jets shot down 49 of 50 Iranian helicopters. At times, fighting took place in waters over deep. Iraq ran live electrical cables through the water, electrocuting numerous Iranian troops and then displaying their corpses on state television. By 29 February, the Iranians had reached the outskirts of Qurna and were closing in on the Baghdad–Basra highway. They had broken out of the marshes and returned to open terrain, where they were confronted by conventional Iraqi weapons, including artillery, tanks, air power, and mustard gas. 1,200 Iranian soldiers were killed in the counter-attack. The Iranians retreated back to the marshes, though they still held onto them along with Majnoon Island. The Battle of the Marshes saw an Iraqi defence that had been under continuous strain since 15 February; they were relieved by their use of chemical weapons and defence-in-depth, where they layered defensive lines: even if the Iranians broke through the first line, they were usually unable to break through the second due to exhaustion and heavy losses. They also largely relied on Mi-24 Hind to \\"hunt\\" the Iranian troops in the marshes, and at least 20,000 Iranians were killed in the marsh battles. Iran used the marshes as a springboard for future attacks/infiltrations. Four years into the war, the human cost to Iran had been 170,000 combat fatalities and 340,000 wounded. Iraqi combat fatalities were estimated at 80,000 with 150,000 wounded. = \\"Tanker War\\" and the \\"War of the Cities\\" = US Navy escort (21 October 1987) Unable to launch successful ground attacks against Iran, Iraq used their now expanded air force to carry out strategic bombing against Iranian shipping, economic targets, and cities in order to damage Iran's economy and morale. Iraq also wanted to provoke Iran into doing something that would cause the superpowers to be directly involved in the conflict on the Iraqi side. Dassault Super Étendard, Iraqi Air Force, 1983  Attacks on shipping  The so-called \\"Tanker War\\" started when Iraq attacked the oil terminal and oil tankers at Kharg Island in early 1984. Iraq's aim in attacking Iranian shipping was to provoke the Iranians to retaliate with extreme measures, such as closing the Strait of Hormuz to all maritime traffic, thereby bringing American intervention; the United States had threatened several times to intervene if the Strait of Hormuz were closed. As a result, the Iranians limited their retaliatory attacks to Iraqi shipping, leaving the strait open to general passage. Iraq declared that all ships going to or from Iranian ports in the northern zone of the Persian Gulf were subject to attack. They used F-1 Mirage, Super Etendard, Mig-23, Su-20/22, and Super Frelon helicopters armed with Exocet anti-ship missiles as well as Soviet-made air- to-surface missiles to enforce their threats. Iraq repeatedly bombed Iran's main oil export facility on Kharg Island, causing increasingly heavy damage. As a first response to these attacks, Iran attacked a Kuwaiti tanker carrying Iraqi oil near Bahrain on 13 May 1984, as well as a Saudi tanker in Saudi waters on 16 May. Because Iraq had become landlocked during the invasion, they had to rely on their Arab allies, primarily Kuwait, to transport their oil. Iran attacked tankers carrying Iraqi oil from Kuwait, later attacking tankers from any Persian Gulf state supporting Iraq. Attacks on ships of noncombatant nations in the Persian Gulf sharply increased thereafter, with both nations attacking oil tankers and merchant ships of neutral nations in an effort to deprive their opponent of trade. The Iranian attacks against Saudi shipping led to Saudi F-15s shooting down a pair of F-4 Phantom II on 5 June 1984. The air and small-boat attacks, however, did little damage to Persian Gulf state economies, and Iran moved its shipping port to Larak Island in the Strait of Hormuz. The Iranian Navy imposed a naval blockade of Iraq, using its British- built frigates to stop and inspect any ships thought to be trading with Iraq. They operated with virtual impunity, as Iraqi pilots had little training in hitting naval targets. Some Iranian warships attacked tankers with ship-to- ship missiles, while others used their radars to guide land-based anti-ship missiles to their targets. Iran began to rely on its new Revolutionary Guard's navy, which used Boghammar speedboats fitted with rocket launchers and heavy machine guns. These speedboats would launch surprise attacks against tankers and cause substantial damage. Iran also used F-4 Phantoms II and helicopters to launch Maverick missiles and unguided rockets at tankers. A U.S. Navy ship, , was struck on 17 May 1987 by two Exocet anti-ship missiles fired from an Iraqi F-1 Mirage plane. The missiles had been fired at about the time the plane was given a routine radio warning by Stark. The frigate did not detect the missiles with radar, and warning was given by the lookout only moments before they struck. Both missiles hit the ship, and one exploded in crew quarters, killing 37 sailors and wounding 21. Lloyd's of London, a British insurance market, estimated that the Tanker War damaged 546 commercial vessels and killed about 430 civilian sailors. The largest portion of the attacks was directed by Iraq against vessels in Iranian waters, with the Iraqis launching three times as many attacks as the Iranians. But Iranian speedboat attacks on Kuwaiti shipping led Kuwait to formally petition foreign powers on 1 November 1986 to protect its shipping. The Soviet Union agreed to charter tankers starting in 1987, and the United States Navy offered to provide protection for foreign tankers reflagged and flying the U.S. flag starting 7 March 1987 in Operation Earnest Will. Neutral tankers shipping to Iran were unsurprisingly not protected by Earnest Will, resulting in reduced foreign tanker traffic to Iran, since they risked Iraqi air attack. Iran accused the United States of helping Iraq. During the course of the war, Iran attacked two Soviet Navy ships which were protecting Kuwaiti tankers. Seawise Giant, the largest ship ever built, was struck and damaged by Iraqi Exocet missiles as it was carrying Iranian crude oil out of the Gulf.  Attacks on cities  Meanwhile, Iraq's air force also began carrying out strategic bombing raids against Iranian cities. While Iraq had launched numerous attacks with aircraft and missiles against border cities from the beginning of the war and sporadic raids on Iran's main cities, this was the first systematic strategic bombing that Iraq carried out during the war. This would become known as the \\"War of the Cities\\". With the help of the USSR and the west, Iraq's air force had been rebuilt and expanded. Meanwhile, Iran, due to sanctions and lack of spare parts, had heavily curtailed its air force operations. Iraq used Tu-22 Blinder and Tu-16 Badger strategic bombers to carry out long-range high-speed raids on Iranian cities, including Tehran. Fighter-bombers such as the Mig-25 Foxbat and Su-22 Fitter were used against smaller or shorter range targets, as well as escorting the strategic bombers. Civilian and industrial targets were hit by the raids, and each successful raid inflicted economic damage from regular strategic bombing. A map indicating the attacks on civilian areas of Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait targeted during the \\"War of the cities\\". In response, the Iranians deployed their F-4 Phantoms to combat the Iraqis, and eventually they deployed F-14s as well. Most of the Iraqi air raids were intercepted by the Iranian fighter jets and air defense, but some also successfully hit their targets, becoming a major headache for Iran. By 1986, Iran also expanded their air defense network heavily to take the load of the fighting off the air force. By later in the war, Iraqi raids primarily consisted of indiscriminate missile attacks while air attacks were used only on fewer, more important targets. Starting in 1987, Saddam also ordered several chemical attacks on civilian targets in Iran, such as the town of Sardasht. Iran also launched several retaliatory air raids on Iraq, while primarily shelling border cities such as Basra. Iran also bought some Scud missiles from Libya, and launched them against Baghdad. These too inflicted damage upon Iraq. On 7 February 1984, (during the first war of the cities) Saddam ordered his air force to attack eleven Iranian cities; bombardments ceased on 22 February 1984. Though Saddam had aimed for the attacks to demoralise Iran and force them to negotiate, they had little effect, and Iran quickly repaired the damage. Iraq's air force took heavy losses, however, and Iran struck back, hitting Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. Nevertheless, the attacks resulted in tens of thousands of civilian casualties on both sides, and became known as the first \\"war of the cities\\". It was estimated that 1,200 Iranian civilians were killed during the raids in February alone. There would be five such major exchanges throughout the course of the war, and multiple minor ones. While interior cities such as Tehran, Tabriz, Qom, Isfahan and Shiraz did receive numerous raids, it was the cities of western Iran that suffered the most death and destruction. = Strategic situation in 1984 = By 1984, Iran's losses were estimated to be 300,000 soldiers, while Iraq's losses were estimated to be 150,000. Foreign analysts agreed that both Iran and Iraq failed to use their modern equipment properly, and both sides failed to carry out modern military assaults that could win the war. Both sides also abandoned equipment in the battlefield because their technicians were unable to carry out repairs. Iran and Iraq showed little internal coordination on the battlefield, and in many cases units were left to fight on their own. As a result, by the end of 1984, the war was a stalemate. One limited offensive Iran launched (Dawn 7) took place from 18–25 October 1984, when they recaptured the Iranian city of Mehran, which had been occupied by the Iraqis from the beginning of the war. 1985–86: Offensives and retreats By 1985, Iraqi armed forces were receiving financial support from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Persian Gulf states, and were making substantial arms purchases from the Soviet Union, China, and France. For the first time since early 1980, Saddam launched new offensives. On 6 January 1986, the Iraqis launched an offensive attempting to retake Majnoon Island. However, they were quickly bogged down into a stalemate against 200,000 Iranian infantrymen, reinforced by amphibious divisions. However, they managed to gain a foothold in the southern part of the island. Iraq also carried out another \\"war of the cities\\" between 12–14 March, hitting up to 158 targets in over 30 towns and cities, including Tehran. Iran responded by launching 14 Scud missiles for the first time, purchased from Libya. More Iraqi air attacks were carried out in August, resulting in hundreds of additional civilian casualties. Iraqi attacks against both Iranian and neutral oil tankers in Iranian waters continued, with Iraq carrying out 150 airstrikes using French bought Super Etendard and Mirage F-1 jets as well as Super Frelon helicopters, using Exocet missiles. = Operation Badr = The Iraqis attacked again on 28 January 1985; they were defeated, and the Iranians retaliated on 11 March 1985 with a major offensive directed against the Baghdad-Basra highway (one of the few major offensives conducted in 1985), codenamed Operation Badr (after the Battle of Badr, Muhammad's first military victory in Mecca). Ayatollah Khomeini urged Iranians on, declaring: > It is our belief that Saddam wishes to return Islam to blasphemy and > polytheism...if America becomes victorious...and grants victory to Saddam, > Islam will receive such a blow that it will not be able to raise its head > for a long time...The issue is one of Islam versus blasphemy, and not of > Iran versus Iraq.A speech on 4 April 1985 by Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian > quoted in This operation was similar to Operation Kheibar, though it invoked more planning. Iran used 100,000 troops, with 60,000 more in reserve. They assessed the marshy terrain, plotted points where they could land tanks, and constructed pontoon bridges across the marshes. The Basij forces were also equipped with anti-tank weapons. The ferocity of the Iranian offensive broke through the Iraqi lines. The Revolutionary Guard, with the support of tanks and artillery, broke through north of Qurna on 14 March. That same night 3,000 Iranian troops reached and crossed the Tigris River using pontoon bridges and captured part of the Baghdad–Basra Highway 8, which they had failed to achieve in Operations Dawn 5 and 6. Saddam responded by launching chemical attacks against the Iranian positions along the highway and by initiating the aforementioned second \\"war of the cities\\", with an air and missile campaign against twenty to thirty Iranian population centres, including Tehran. Under General Sultan Hashim Ahmad al-Tai and General Jamal Zanoun (both considered to be among Iraq's most skilled commanders), the Iraqis launched air attacks against the Iranian positions and pinned them down. They then launched a pincer attack using mechanized infantry and heavy artillery. Chemical weapons were used, and the Iraqis also flooded Iranian trenches with specially constructed pipes delivering water from the Tigris River. The Iranians retreated back to the Hoveyzeh marshes while being attacked by helicopters, and the highway was recaptured by the Iraqis. Operation Badr resulted in 10,000–12,000 Iraqi casualties and 15,000 Iranian ones. = Strategic situation at the beginning of 1986 = The failure of the human wave attacks in earlier years had prompted Iran to develop a better working relationship between the Army and the Revolutionary Guard and to mould the Revolutionary Guard units into a more conventional fighting force. To combat Iraq's use of chemical weapons, Iran began producing an antidote. They also created and fielded their own homemade drones, the Mohajer 1's, fitted with six RPG-7's to launch attacks. They were primarily used in observation, being used for up to 700 sorties. For the rest of 1986, and until the spring of 1988, the Iranian Air Force's efficiency in air defence increased, with weapons being repaired or replaced and new tactical methods being used. For example, the Iranians would loosely integrate their SAM sites and interceptors to create \\"killing fields\\" in which dozens of Iraqi planes were lost (which was reported in the West as the Iranian Air Force using F-14s as \\"mini-AWACs\\"). The Iraqi Air Force reacted by increasing the sophistication of its equipment, incorporating modern electronic countermeasure pods, decoys such as chaff and flare, and anti-radiation missiles. Due to the heavy losses in the last war of the cities, Iraq reduced their use of aerial attacks on Iranian cities. Instead, they would launch Scud missiles, which the Iranians could not stop. Since the range of the Scud missile was too short to reach Tehran, they converted them to al-Hussein missiles with the help of East German engineers, cutting up their Scuds into three chunks and attaching them together. Iran responded to these attacks by using their own Scud missiles. Aside from extensive foreign help to Iraq, Iranian attacks were severely hampered by their shortages of weaponry, including heavy weaponry. Large portions of them had been lost during the last several years. Iran still managed to maintain 1,000 tanks (often by capturing Iraqi ones) and additional artillery, but many needed repairs to be operational. But by this time Iran managed to procure spare parts from various sources, helping them to restore some weapons. They secretly imported some weapons, such as RBS-70 anti-aircraft MANPADS. In an exception to the United States' support for Iraq, in exchange for Iran using its influence to help free western hostages in Lebanon, the United States secretly sold Iran some limited supplies (in Ayatollah Rafsanjani's postwar interview, he stated that during the period when Iran was succeeding, for a short time the United States supported Iran, then shortly after began helping Iraq again). Iran managed to get some advanced weapons, such as anti-tank TOW missiles, which worked better than rocket-propelled grenades. Iran later reverse-engineered and produced those weapons on their own as well. All of these almost certainly helped increase the effectiveness of Iran, although it did not reduce the human cost of their attacks. = First Battle of al-Faw = On the night of 10–11 February 1986, the Iranians launched Operation Dawn 8, in which 30,000 troops comprising five Army divisions and men from the Revolutionary Guard and Basij advanced in a two-pronged offensive to capture the al-Faw peninsula in southern Iraq, the only area touching the Persian Gulf. The capture of Al Faw and Umm Qasr was a major goal for Iran. Iran began with a feint attack against Basra, which was stopped by the Iraqis; Meanwhile, an amphibious strike force landed at the foot of the peninsula. The resistance, consisting of several thousand poorly trained soldiers of the Iraqi Popular Army, fled or were defeated, and the Iranian forces set up pontoon bridges crossing the Shatt al-Arab, allowing 30,000 soldiers to cross in a short period of time. They drove north along the peninsula almost unopposed, capturing it after only 24 hours of fighting. Afterwards they dug in and set up defenses. The sudden capture of al-Faw took the Iraqis by shock, since they had thought it impossible for the Iranians to cross the Shatt al- Arab. On 12 February 1986, the Iraqis began a counter-offensive to retake al- Faw, which failed after a week of heavy fighting. On 24 February 1986, Saddam sent one of his best commanders, General Maher Abd al-Rashid, and the Republican Guard to begin a new offensive to recapture al-Faw. A new round of heavy fighting took place. However, their attempts again ended in failure, costing them many tanks and aircraft: their 15th mechanised division was almost completely wiped out. The capture of al-Faw and the failure of the Iraqi counter-offensives were blows to the Ba'ath regime's prestige, and led the Gulf countries to fear that Iran might win the war. Kuwait in particular felt menaced with Iranian troops only away, and increased its support of Iraq accordingly. In March 1986, the Iranians tried to follow up their success by attempting to take Umm Qasr, which would have completely severed Iraq from the Gulf and placed Iranian troops on the border with Kuwait. However, the offensive failed due to Iranian shortages of armor. By this time, 17,000 Iraqis and 30,000 Iranians were made casualties. The First Battle of al-Faw ended in March, but heavy combat operations lasted on the peninsula into 1988, with neither side being able to displace the other. The battle bogged down into a World War I-style stalemate in the marshes of the peninsula. = Battle of Mehran = Immediately after the Iranian capture of al-Faw, Saddam declared a new offensive against Iran, designed to drive deep into the state. The Iranian border city of Mehran, on the foot of the Zagros Mountains, was selected as the first target. On 15–19 May, Iraqi Army's Second Corps, supported by helicopter gunships, attacked and captured the city. Saddam then offered the Iranians to exchange Mehran for al-Faw. The Iranians rejected the offer. Iraq then continued the attack, attempting to push deeper into Iran. However, Iraq's attack was quickly warded off by Iranian AH-1 Cobra helicopters with TOW missiles, which destroyed numerous Iraqi tanks and vehicles. The Iranians built up their forces on the heights surrounding Mehran. On 30 June, using mountain warfare tactics they launched their attack, recapturing the city by 3 July. Saddam ordered the Republican Guard to retake the city on 4 July, but their attack was ineffective. Iraqi losses were heavy enough to allow the Iranians to also capture territory inside Iraq, and depleted the Iraqi military enough to prevent them from launching a major offensive for the next two years. Iraq's defeats at al-Faw and at Mehran were severe blows to the prestige of the Iraqi regime, and western powers, including the US, became more determined to prevent an Iraqi loss. = Strategic situation at the end of 1986 = Through the eyes of international observers, Iran was prevailing in the war by the end of 1986. In the northern front, the Iranians began launching attacks toward the city of Suleimaniya with the help of Kurdish fighters, taking the Iraqis by surprise. They came within of the city before being stopped by chemical and army attacks. Iran's army had also reached the Meimak Hills, only from Baghdad. Iraq managed to contain Iran's offensives in the south, but was under serious pressure, as the Iranians were slowly overwhelming them. Iraq responded by launching another \\"war of the cities\\". In one attack, Tehran's main oil refinery was hit, and in another instance, Iraq damaged Iran's Assadabad satellite dish, disrupting Iranian overseas telephone and telex service for almost two weeks. Civilian areas were also hit, resulting in many casualties. Iraq continued to attack oil tankers via air. Iran responded by launching Scud missiles and air attacks at Iraqi targets. Iraq continued to attack Kharg Island and the oil tankers and facilities as well. Iran created a tanker shuttle service of 20 tankers to move oil from Kharg to Larak Island, escorted by Iranian fighter jets. Once moved to Larak, the oil would be moved to oceangoing tankers (usually neutral). They also rebuilt the oil terminals damaged by Iraqi air raids and moved shipping to Larak Island, while attacking foreign tankers that carried Iraqi oil (as Iran had blocked Iraq's access to the open sea with the capture of al-Faw). By now they almost always used the armed speedboats of the IRGC navy, and attacked many tankers. The tanker war escalated drastically, with attacks nearly doubling in 1986 (the majority carried out by Iraq). Iraq got permission from the Saudi government to use its airspace to attack Larak Island, although due to the distance attacks were less frequent there. The escalating tanker war in the Gulf became an ever-increasing concern to foreign powers, especially the United States. In April 1986, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa declaring that the war must be won by March 1987. The Iranians increased recruitment efforts, obtaining 650,000 volunteers. The animosity between the Army and the Revolutionary Guard arose again, with the Army wanting to use more refined, limited military attacks while the Revolutionary Guard wanted to carry out major offensives. Iran, confident in its successes, began planning their largest offensives of the war, which they called their \\"final offensives.\\"  Iraq's dynamic defense strategy  Faced with their recent defeats in al-Faw and Mehran, Iraq appeared to be losing the war. Iraq's generals, angered by Saddam's interference, threatened a full-scale mutiny against the Ba'ath Party unless they were allowed to conduct operations freely. In one of the few times during his career, Saddam gave in to the demands of his generals. Up to this point, Iraqi strategy was to ride out Iranian attacks. However, the defeat at al-Faw led Saddam to declare the war to be Al-Defa al-Mutaharakha (The Dynamic Defense), and announcing that all civilians had to take part in the war effort. The universities were closed and all of the male students were drafted into the military. Civilians were instructed to clear marshlands to prevent Iranian amphibious infiltrations and to help build fixed defenses. The government tried to integrate the Shias into the war effort by recruiting many as part of the Ba'ath Party. In an attempt to counterbalance the religious fervor of the Iranians and gain support from the devout masses, the regime also began to promote religion and, on the surface, Islamization, despite the fact that Iraq was run by a secular regime. Scenes of Saddam praying and making pilgrimages to shrines became common on state-run television. While Iraqi morale had been low throughout the war, the attack on al-Faw raised patriotic fervor, as the Iraqis feared invasion. Saddam also recruited volunteers from other Arab countries into the Republican Guard, and received much technical support from foreign nations as well. While Iraqi military power had been depleted in recent battles, through heavy foreign purchases and support, they were able to expand their military even to much larger proportions by 1988. At the same time, Saddam ordered the genocidal al-Anfal Campaign in an attempt to crush the Kurdish resistance, who were now allied with Iran. The result was the deaths of several hundred thousand Iraqi Kurds, and the destruction of villages, towns, and cities. Iraq began to try to perfect its maneuver tactics. The Iraqis began to prioritize the professionalization of their military. Prior to 1986, the conscription- based Iraqi regular army and the volunteer-based Iraqi Popular Army conducted the bulk of the operations in the war, to little effect. The Republican Guard, formerly an elite praetorian guard, was expanded as a volunteer army and filled with Iraq's best generals. Loyalty to the state was no longer a primary requisite for joining. However, due to Saddam's paranoia, the former duties of the Republican Guard were transferred to a new unit, the Special Republican Guard. Full-scale war games against hypothetical Iranian positions were carried out in the western Iraqi desert against mock targets, and they were repeated over the course of a full year until the forces involved fully memorized their attacks. Iraq built its military massively, eventually possessing the 4th largest in the world, in order to overwhelm the Iranians through sheer size. 1987–88: Towards a ceasefire The People's Mujahedin of Iran, supported by Saddam, started a ten-day operation after both the Iranian and Iraqi governments accepted UN Resolution 598. Casualty estimates range from 2,000 to 10,000. Meanwhile, as the Iraqis were planning their strike, the Iranians continued to attack. 1987 saw a renewed series of major Iranian human wave offensives in both northern and southern Iraq. The Iraqis had elaborately fortified Basra with 5 defensive rings, exploiting natural waterways such as the Shatt-al-Arab and artificial ones, such as Fish Lake and the Jasim River, along with earth barriers. Fish Lake was a massive lake filled with mines, underwater barbed wire, electrodes and sensors. Behind each waterway and defensive line was radar-guided artillery, ground attack aircraft and helicopters; all capable of firing poison gas or conventional munitions. The Iranian strategy was to penetrate the Iraqi defences and encircle Basra, cutting off the city as well as the Al-Faw peninsula from the rest of Iraq. Iran's plan was for three assaults: a diversionary attack near Basra, the main offensive and another diversionary attack using Iranian tanks in the north to divert Iraqi heavy armor from Basra. For these battles, Iran had re-expanded their military by recruiting many new Basij and Pasdaran volunteers. Iran brought 150,000–200,000 total troops into the battles. = Karbala operations = Operation Karbala-4  On 25 December 1986, Iran launched Operation Karbala-4 (Karbala referring to Hussein ibn Ali's Battle of Karbala). According to Iraqi General Ra'ad al-Hamdani, this was a diversionary attack. The Iranians launched an amphibious assault against the Iraqi island of Umm al-Rassas in the Shatt-Al-Arab river, parallel to Khoramshahr; they then set up a pontoon bridge and continued the attack, eventually capturing it in a costly success and failing to advance further; the Iranians had 60,000 casualties, while the Iraqis 9,500. The Iraqi commanders exaggerated Iranian losses to Saddam and it was assumed that the main Iranian attack on Basra had been fully defeated and that it would take the Iranians six months to recover. When the main Iranian attack, Operation Karbala 5 began, many Iraqi troops were on leave.  Operation Karbala-5 (Sixth Battle of Basra)  The Siege of Basra, code-named Operation Karbala-5 (), was an offensive operation carried out by Iran in an effort to capture the Iraqi port city of Basra in early 1987. This battle, known for its extensive casualties and ferocious conditions, was the biggest battle of the war and proved to be the beginning of the end of the Iran–Iraq War.Pollack, Kenneth M. (2004). \\"Iraq\\". Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948–1991. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. .  Operation Karbala-6  At the same time as Operation Karbala 5, Iran also launched Operation Karbala-6 against the Iraqis in Qasr-e Shirin in central Iran to prevent the Iraqis from rapidly transferring units down to defend against the Karbala-5 attack. The attack was carried out by Basij infantry and the Revolutionary Guard's 31st Ashura and the Army's 77th Khorasan armored divisions. The Basij attacked the Iraqi lines, forcing the Iraqi infantry to retreat. An Iraqi armored counter-attack surrounded the Basij in a pincer movement, but the Iranian tank divisions attacked, breaking the encirclement. The Iranian attack was finally stopped by mass Iraqi chemical weapons attacks. = Iranian war-weariness = Iranian troops fire 152 mm D-20 howitzer Operation Karbala-5 was a severe blow to Iran's military and morale. To foreign observers, it appeared that Iran was continuing to strengthen. By 1988, Iran had become self-sufficient in many areas, such as anti-tank TOW missiles, Scud ballistic missiles (Shahab-1), Silkworm anti-ship missiles, Oghab tactical rockets, and producing spare parts for their weaponry. Iran had also improved its air defenses with smuggled surface to air missiles. Iran even was producing UAV's and the Pilatus PC-7 propeller aircraft for observation. Iran also doubled their stocks of artillery, and was self-sufficient in manufacture of ammunition and small arms. While it was not obvious to foreign observers, the Iranian public had become increasingly war- weary and disillusioned with the fighting, and relatively few volunteers joined the fight in 1987–88. Because the Iranian war effort relied on popular mobilization, their military strength actually declined, and Iran was unable to launch any major offensives after Karbala-5. As a result, for the first time since 1982, the momentum of the fighting shifted towards the regular army. Since the regular army was conscription based, it made the war even less popular. Many Iranians began to try to escape the conflict. As early as May 1985, anti-war demonstrations took place in 74 cities throughout Iran, which were crushed by the regime, resulting in some protesters being shot and killed. By 1987, draft-dodging had become a serious problem, and the Revolutionary Guards and police set up roadblocks throughout cities to capture those who tried to evade conscription. Other people (including the more nationalistic and religious) as well as the clergy, and the Revolutionary Guards, wished to continue the war. The leadership acknowledged that the war was a stalemate, and began to plan accordingly. There were no more \\"final offensives\\" planned. The head of the Supreme Defense Council Hashemi Rafsanjani announced during a news conference to finally end the use of human wave attacks. Mohsen Rezaee, head of the IRGC, announced that Iran would focus exclusively on limited attacks and infiltrations, while arming and supporting opposition groups inside of Iraq. On the Iranian home front, the combination of sanctions, declining oil prices, and Iraqi attacks on Iranian oil facilities and shipping took a heavy toll on the economy. While the attacks themselves were not as destructive as some analysts believed, the U.S.-led Operation Earnest Will (which protected Iraqi and allied oil tankers, but not Iranian ones) led many neutral countries to stop trading with Iran because of rising insurance and fear of air attack. Iranian oil and non-oil exports fell by 55%, inflation reached 50% by 1987, and unemployment skyrocketed. At the same time, Iraq was experiencing crushing debt and shortages of workers, encouraging its leadership to try to end the war quickly.  Strategic situation in late 1987  By the end of 1987, Iraq possessed 5,550 tanks (outnumbering the Iranians six to one) and 900 fighter aircraft (outnumbering the Iranians ten to one). After Operation Karbala-5, Iraq only had 100 qualified fighter pilots remaining; therefore, Iraq began to invest in recruiting foreign pilots from countries such as Belgium, South Africa, Pakistan, East Germany and the Soviet Union. They replenished their manpower by integrating volunteers from other Arab countries into their army. Iraq also became self-sufficient in chemical weapons and some conventional ones and received much equipment from abroad. Foreign support helped Iraq bypass its economic troubles and massive debt to continue the war and increase the size of its military. While the southern and central fronts were at a stalemate, Iran began to focus on carrying out offensives in northern Iraq with the help of the Peshmerga (Kurdish insurgents). The Iranians used a combination of semi-guerrilla and infiltration tactics in the Kurdish mountains with the Peshmerga. During Operation Karbala-9 in early April, Iran captured territory near Suleimaniya, provoking a severe poison gas counter-attack. During Operation Karbala-10, Iran attacked near the same area, capturing more territory. During Operation Nasr-4, the Iranians surrounded the city of Suleimaniya and with the help of the Peshmerga infiltrated over 140 km into Iraq and raided and threatened to capture the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other northern oilfields. Nasr-4 was considered to be Iran's most successful individual operation of the war but Iranian forces were unable to consolidate their gains and continue their advance; while these offensives coupled with the Kurdish uprising sapped Iraqi strength, losses in the north would not mean a catastrophic failure for Iraq. On 20 July, the UN Security Council passed the U.S.-sponsored Resolution 598, which called for an end to the fighting and a return to pre-war boundaries. This resolution was noted by Iran for being the first resolution to call for a return to the pre-war borders, and setting up a commission to determine the aggressor and compensation.  Air and tanker war in 1987  With the stalemate on land, the air/tanker war began to play an increasingly major role in the conflict. The Iranian air force had become very small, having only 20 F-4 Phantoms, 20 F-5 Tigers, and 15 F-14 Tomcats in operation. Despite that, Iran managed to restore some damaged planes into service. The Iranian Air Force, despite its once sophisticated equipment, lacked enough equipment and personnel to sustain the war of attrition that had arisen, and was unable to lead an outright onslaught against Iraq. The Iraqi Air Force, however, had originally lacked modern equipment and experienced pilots, but after pleas from Iraqi military leaders, Saddam decreased political influence on everyday operations and left the fighting to his combatants. The Soviets began delivering more advanced aircraft and weapons to Iraq, while the French improved training for flying crews and technical personnel and continually introduced new methods for countering Iranian weapons and tactics. Iranian ground air defense still shot down many Iraqi aircraft. The main Iraqi air effort had shifted to the destruction of Iranian war-fighting capability (primarily Persian Gulf oil fields, tankers, and Kharg Island) and starting late 1986, the Iraqi Air Force moved on a comprehensive campaign against the Iranian economic infrastructure. By late 1987, the Iraqi Air Force could count on direct American support for conducting long-range operations against Iranian infrastructural targets and oil installations deep in the Persian Gulf. U.S. Navy ships tracked and reported movements of Iranian shipping and defences. In the massive Iraqi air strike against Kharg Island, flown on 18 March 1988 the Iraqis destroyed two supertankers but lost five aircraft to Iranian F-14 Tomcats, including two Tupolev Tu-22Bs and one Mikoyan MiG-25RB. The U.S. Navy was now becoming more involved in the fight in the Persian Gulf, launching Operations Earnest Will and Prime Chance against the Iranians. swarm tactics The attacks on oil tankers continued. Both Iran and Iraq carried frequent attacks during the first four months of the year. Iran was effectively waging a naval guerilla war with its IRGC navy speedboats, while Iraq attacked with its aircraft. In 1987, Kuwait asked to reflag its tankers to the U.S. flag. They did so in March, and the U.S. Navy began Operation Earnest Will to escort the tankers. The result of Earnest Will would be that while oil tankers shipping Iraqi/Kuwaiti oil were protected, Iranian tankers, and neutral tankers shipping to Iran would be unprotected, resulting in both losses for Iran and the undermining of its trade with foreign countries, damaging Iran's economy further. Iran also deployed Silkworm missiles to attack some ships, but only a few were actually fired. Both the United States and Iran jockeyed for influence in the Gulf. To discourage the United States from escorting tankers, Iran secretly mined some areas in the Gulf. The United States began to escort the reflagged tankers, but one of them was damaged by a mine while under escort. While being a public-relations victory for Iran, the United States increased its reflagging efforts. While Iran mined the Persian Gulf, their speedboat attacks were reduced, primarily attacking unflagged tankers shipping in the area. On 24 September, US Navy SEALS captured the Iranian mine-laying ship Iran Ajr, a diplomatic disaster for the already isolated Iranians. On 8 October, the U.S. Navy destroyed four Iranian speedboats, and in response to Iranian Silkworm missile attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers, launched Operation Nimble Archer, destroying two Iranian oil rigs in the Persian Gulf. During November and December, the Iraqi air force launched a bid to destroy all Iranian airbases in Khuzestan and the remaining Iranian air force. Iran managed to shoot down 30 Iraqi fighters with fighter jets, anti-aircraft guns, and missiles, allowing the Iranian air force to survive to the end of the war. On 28 June, Iraqi fighter bombers attacked the Iranian town of Sardasht near the border, using chemical mustard gas bombs. While many towns and cities had been bombed before, and troops attacked with gas, this was the first time that the Iraqis had attacked a civilian area with poison gas. One quarter of the town's then population of 20,000 was burned and stricken, and 113 were killed immediately, with many more dying and suffering health effects over the next decades. Saddam ordered the attack in order to test the effects of the newly developed \\"dusty mustard\\" gas, which was designed to be even more crippling than traditional mustard gas. While little known outside of Iran (unlike the later Halabja chemical attack), the Sardasht bombing (and future similar attacks) had a tremendous effect on the Iranian people's psyche. = 1988: Iraqi offensives and UN ceasefire = By 1988, with massive equipment imports and reduced Iranian volunteers, Iraq was ready to launch major offensives against Iran. In February 1988, Saddam began the fifth and most deadly \\"war of the cities\\". Over the next two months, Iraq launched over 200 al-Hussein missiles at 37 Iranian cities. Saddam also threatened to use chemical weapons in his missiles, which caused 30% of Tehran's population to leave the city. Iran retaliated, launching at least 104 missiles against Iraq in 1988 and shelling Basra. This event was nicknamed the \\"Scud Duel\\" in the foreign media. In all, Iraq launched 520 Scuds and al-Husseins against Iran and Iran fired 177 at them. The Iranian attacks were too few in number to deter Iraq from launching their attacks. Iraq also increased their airstrikes against Kharg Island and Iranian oil tankers. With their allies tankers protected by U.S. warships, they could operate with virtual impunity. To make matters worse, the West supplied Iraq's air force with laser-guided smart bombs, allowing them to attack economic targets while evading anti-aircraft defenses. These attacks began to have a major toll on the Iranian economy, morale, and caused many casualties as well.  Iran's Kurdistan Operations  In March 1988, the Iranians carried out Operation Dawn 10, Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas 2, Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas 3, Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas 4, and Operation Zafar 7 in Iraqi Kurdistan with the aim of capturing the Darbandikhan Dam and the power plant at Lake Dukan, which supplied Iraq with much of its electricity and water, as well as the city of Suleimaniya. Iran hoped that the capture of these areas would bring more favorable terms to the ceasefire agreement. This infiltration offensive was carried out in conjunction with the Peshmerga. Iranian airborne commandos landed behind the Iraqi lines and Iranian helicopters hit Iraqi tanks with TOW missiles. The Iraqis were taken by surprise, and Iranian F-5E Tiger fighter jets even damaged the Kirkuk oil refinery. Iraq carried out executions of multiple officers for these failures in March–April 1988, including Colonel Jafar Sadeq. The Iranians used infiltration tactics in the Kurdish mountains, captured the town of Halabja and began to fan out across the province. Though the Iranians advanced to within sight of Dukan and captured around and 4,000 Iraqi troops, the offensive failed due to the Iraqi use of chemical warfare. The Iraqis launched the deadliest chemical weapons attacks of the war. The Republican Guard launched 700 chemical shells, while the other artillery divisions launched 200–300 chemical shells each, unleashing a chemical cloud over the Iranians, killing or wounding 60% of them, the blow was felt particularly by the Iranian 84th infantry division and 55th paratrooper division. The Iraqi special forces then stopped the remains of the Iranian force. In retaliation for Kurdish collaboration with the Iranians, Iraq launched a massive poison gas attack against Kurdish civilians in Halabja, recently taken by the Iranians, killing thousands of civilians. Iran airlifted foreign journalists to the ruined city, and the images of the dead were shown throughout the world but Western mistrust of Iran and collaboration with Iraq led them to also blame Iran for the attack. At one point, the United States claimed that Iran had launched the attack and then tried to blame Iraq for it.  Second Battle of al-Faw  On 17 April 1988, Iraq launched Operation Ramadan Mubarak (Blessed Ramadan), a surprise attack against the 15,000 Basij troops on the peninsula. The attack on al-Faw was preceded by Iraqi diversionary attacks in northern Iraq, with a massive artillery and air barrage of Iranian front lines. Key areas, such as supply lines, command posts, and ammunition depots, were hit by a storm of mustard gas and nerve gas, as well as by conventional explosives. Helicopters landed Iraqi commandos behind Iranian lines while the main Iraqi force attacked in a frontal assault. Within 48 hours, all of the Iranian forces had been killed or cleared from the al-Faw Peninsula. The day was celebrated in Iraq as Faw Liberation Day throughout Saddam's rule. The Iraqis had planned the offensive well. Prior to the attack the Iraqi soldiers gave themselves poison gas antidotes to shield themselves from the effect of the saturation of gas. The heavy and well executed use of chemical weapons was the decisive factor in the Iraqi victory. Iraqi losses were relatively light, especially compared to Iran's casualties. The Iranians eventually managed to halt the Iraqi drive as they pushed towards Khuzestan. To the shock of the Iranians, rather than breaking off the offensive, the Iraqis kept up their drive, and a new force attacked the Iranian positions around Basra. Following this, the Iraqis launched a sustained drive to clear the Iranians out of all of southern Iraq. One of the most successful Iraqi tactics was the \\"one-two punch\\" attack using chemical weapons. Using artillery, they would saturate the Iranian front line with rapidly dispersing cyanide and nerve gas, while longer-lasting mustard gas was launched via fighter-bombers and rockets against the Iranian rear, creating a \\"chemical wall\\" that blocked reinforcement.  Operation Praying Mantis  IS Sahand burns after being hit by 20 U.S. air launched missiles and bombs, killing a third of the crew. April 1988 The same day as Iraq's attack on al-Faw peninsula, the United States Navy launched Operation Praying Mantis in retaliation against Iran for damaging a warship with a mine. Iran lost oil platforms, destroyers, and frigates in this battle, which ended only when President Reagan decided that the Iranian navy had been put down enough. In spite of this, the Revolutionary Guard Navy continued their speedboat attacks against oil tankers. The defeats at al-Faw and in the Persian Gulf nudged Iranian leadership towards quitting the war, especially when facing the prospect of fighting the Americans.  Iranian counteroffensive  Faced with such losses, Khomeini appointed the cleric Hashemi Rafsanjani as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, though he had in actuality occupied that position for months. Rafsanjani ordered a last desperate counter-attack into Iraq, which was launched 13 June 1988. The Iranians infiltrated through the Iraqi trenches and moved into Iraq and managed to strike Saddam's presidential palace in Baghdad using fighter aircraft. After three days of fighting, the decimated Iranians were driven back to their original positions again as the Iraqis launched 650 helicopter and 300 aircraft sorties.  Operation Forty Stars  On 18 June, Iraq launched Operation Forty Stars ( chehel cheragh) in conjunction to the Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MEK) around Mehran. With 530 aircraft sorties and heavy use of nerve gas, they crushed the Iranian forces in the area, killing 3,500 and nearly destroying a Revolutionary Guard division. Mehran was captured once again and occupied by the MEK. Iraq also launched air raids on Iranian population centers and economic targets, setting 10 oil installations on fire.  Tawakalna ala Allah operations  On 25 May 1988, Iraq launched the first of five Tawakalna ala Allah (Trust in God) Operations, consisting of one of the largest artillery barrages in history, coupled with chemical weapons. The marshes had been dried by drought, allowing the Iraqis to use tanks to bypass Iranian field fortifications, expelling the Iranians from the border town of Shalamcheh after less than 10 hours of combat. On 25 June, Iraq launched the second Tawakal ala Allah operation against the Iranians on Majnoon Island. Iraqi commandos used amphibious craft to block the Iranian rear, then used hundreds of tanks with massed conventional and chemical artillery barrages to recapture the island after 8 hours of combat. Saddam appeared live on Iraqi television to \\"lead\\" the charge against the Iranians. The majority of the Iranian defenders were killed during the quick assault. The final two Tawakal ala Allah operations took place near al-Amarah and Khaneqan. By 12 July, the Iraqis had captured the city of Dehloran, inside Iran, along with 2,500 troops and much armour and material, which took four days to transport to Iraq. These losses included more than 570 of the 1,000 remaining Iranian tanks, over 430 armored vehicles, 45 self-propelled artillery, 300 towed artillery pieces, and 320 antiaircraft guns. These figures only included what Iraq could actually put to use; total amount of captured materiel was higher. Since March, the Iraqis claimed to captured 1,298 tanks, 155 infantry fighting vehicles, 512 heavy artillery pieces, 6,196 mortars, 5,550 recoilless rifles and light guns, 8,050 man-portable rocket launchers, 60,694 rifles, 322 pistols, 454 trucks, and 1,600 light vehicles. The Iraqis withdrew from Dehloran soon after, claiming that they had \\"no desire to conquer Iranian territory.\\" History professor Kaveh Farrokh considered this to be Iran's greatest military disaster during the war. Stephen Pelletier, a Journalist, Middle East expert, and Author, noted that \\"Tawakal ala Allah … resulted in the absolute destruction of Iran's military machine.\\" Iranian soldiers captured during Iraq's 1988 offensives During the 1988 battles, the Iranians put up little resistance to the Iraqi offensives, having been worn out by nearly eight years of war. They lost large amounts of equipment but they managed to rescue most of their troops from being captured by the Iraqis, leaving Iraq with relatively few prisoners. On 2 July, Iran belatedly set up a joint central command which unified the Revolutionary Guard, Army, and Kurdish rebels, and dispelled the rivalry between the Army and the Revolutionary Guard. However, this came too late, and due to the capture of 570 of their operable tanks and the destruction of hundreds more, Iran was believed to have fewer than 200 remaining operable tanks on the southern front, faced against thousands of Iraqi ones. The only area where the Iranians were not suffering major defeats was in Kurdistan.  Iran accepts the ceasefire  Saddam sent a warning to Khomeini in mid-1988, threatening to launch a new and powerful full-scale invasion and attack Iranian cities with weapons of mass destruction. Shortly afterwards, Iraqi aircraft bombed the Iranian town of Oshnavieh with poison gas, immediately killing and wounding over 2,000 civilians. The fear of an all out chemical attack against Iran's largely unprotected civilian population weighed heavily on the Iranian leadership, and they realized that the international community had no intention of restraining Iraq. The lives of the civilian population of Iran were becoming very disrupted, with a third of the urban population evacuating major cities in fear of the seemingly imminent chemical war. Meanwhile, Iraqi conventional bombs and missiles continuously hit towns and cities, as well as destroyed vital civilian and military infrastructure, and the death toll increased. Iran did reply with missile and air attacks as well, but not enough to deter the Iraqis from attacking. Under the threat of a new and even more powerful invasion, Commander-in-Chief Rafsanjani ordered the Iranians to retreat from Haj Omran, Kurdistan on 14 July. The Iranians did not publicly describe this as a retreat, instead calling it a \\"temporary withdrawal\\". By July, Iran's army inside Iraq (except Kurdistan) had largely disintegrated. Iraq put up a massive display of captured Iranian weapons in Baghdad, claiming they captured 1,298 tanks, 5,550 recoil-less rifles, and thousands of other weapons. However, Iraq had taken heavy losses as well, and the battles were very costly. In July 1988, Iraqi aircraft dropped bombs on the Iranian Kurdish village of Zardan. Dozens of villages, such as Sardasht, and some larger towns, such as Marivan, Baneh and Saqqez, were once again attacked with poison gas, resulting in even heavier civilian casualties. About the same time, the USS Vincennes shot down Iran Air Flight 655, killing 290 passengers and crew. The lack of international sympathy disturbed the Iranian leadership, and they came to the conclusion that the United States was on the verge of waging a full-scale war against them, and that Iraq was on the verge of unleashing its entire chemical arsenal upon their cities. At this point, elements of the Iranian leadership, led by Rafsanjani (who had initially pushed for the extension of the war), persuaded Khomeini to accept the ceasefire. They stated that in order to win the war, Iran's military budget would have to be increased by 700% and the war would last until 1993. On 20 July 1988, Iran accepted Resolution 598, showing its willingness to accept a ceasefire. A statement from Khomeini was read out in a radio address, and he expressed deep displeasure and reluctance about accepting the ceasefire, > Happy are those who have departed through martyrdom. Happy are those who > have lost their lives in this convoy of light. Unhappy am I that I still > survive and have drunk the poisoned chalice... The news of the end of the war was greeted with celebration in Baghdad, with people dancing in the streets; in Tehran, however, the end of the war was greeted with a somber mood. = Operation Mersad and end of the war = President Ali Khamenei visits an Iran-Iraq war battlefield, August 1988. Operation Mersad ( \\"ambush\\") was the last big military operation of the war. Both Iran and Iraq had accepted Resolution 598 but despite the ceasefire, after seeing Iraqi victories in the previous months, Mujahadeen-e-Khalq (MEK) decided to launch an attack of its own and wished to advance all the way to Teheran. Saddam and the Iraqi high command decided on a two pronged offensive across the border into central Iran and Iranian Kurdistan. Shortly after Iran accepted the ceasefire the MEK army began its offensive, attacking into Ilam province under cover of Iraqi air power. In the north, Iraq also launched an attack into Iraqi Kurdistan, which was blunted by the Iranians. On 26 July 1988, the MEK started their campaign in central Iran, Operation Forough Javidan (Eternal Light), with the support of the Iraqi army. The Iranians had withdrawn their remaining soldiers to Khuzestan in fear of a new Iraqi invasion attempt, allowing the Mujahedeen to advance rapidly towards Kermanshah, seizing Qasr-e Shirin, Sarpol-e Zahab, Kerend-e Gharb, and Islamabad-e-Gharb. The MEK expected the Iranian population to rise up and support their advance; the uprising never materialised but they reached deep into Iran. In response, the Iranian military launched its counter-attack, Operation Mersad, under Lieutenant General Ali Sayyad Shirazi. Iranian paratroopers landed behind the MEK lines while the Iranian Air Force and helicopters launched an air attack, destroying much of the enemy columns. The Iranians defeated the MEK in the city of Kerend-e Gharb on 29 July 1988. On 31 July, Iran drove the MEK out of Qasr-e-Shirin and Sarpol Zahab, though MEK claimed to have \\"voluntarily withdrawn\\" from the towns. Iran estimated that 4,500 MEK were killed, while 400 Iranian soldiers died. MEK Soldiers killed in Operation Mersad in 1988 The last notable combat actions of the war took place on 3 August 1988, in the Persian Gulf when the Iranian navy fired on a freighter and Iraq launched chemical attacks on Iranian civilians, killing an unknown number of them and wounding 2,300. Iraq came under international pressure to curtail further offensives. Resolution 598 became effective on 8 August 1988, ending all combat operations between the two countries. By 20 August 1988, peace with Iran was restored. UN peacekeepers belonging to the UNIIMOG mission took the field, remaining on the Iran–Iraq border until 1991. The majority of Western analysts believe that the war had no winners while some believed that Iraq emerged as the victor of the war, based on Iraq's overwhelming successes between April and July 1988. Others can argue that Iran was the victor after successfully defending their country from invasion and repelling the aggressor despite being isolated and under international sanctions and while their enemy was exceptionally well funded and supported. While the war was now over, Iraq spent the rest of August and early September clearing the Kurdish resistance. Using 60,000 troops along with helicopter gunships, chemical weapons (poison gas), and mass executions, Iraq hit 15 villages, killing rebels and civilians, and forced tens of thousands of Kurds to relocate to settlements. Many Kurdish civilians fled to Iran. By 3 September 1988, the anti-Kurd campaign ended, and all resistance had been crushed. 400 Iraqi soldiers and 50,000–100,000 Kurdish civilians and soldiers had been killed. At the war's conclusion, it took several weeks for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran to evacuate Iraqi territory to honor pre-war international borders set by the 1975 Algiers Agreement. The last prisoners of war were exchanged in 2003. The Security Council did not identify Iraq as the aggressor of the war until 11 December 1991, some 12 years after Iraq invaded Iran and 16 months following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

Her origins are currently obscure. She served as a privateer first under that name, and then under the name Diligent. As Diligent she not only capture several merchantmen but also two British Royal Navy vessels: a schooner and a brig. She continued to capture prizes until the end of 1813 and then disappears from online records. Origins By one source Dame Ernouf was the privateer brig Barbara, of 185 tons (bm), that the French privateer General Ernouf had captured on 15 September 1807 and had taken into Guadeloupe.Demerliac (2004), n°2757, p.323. However, the vessel that General Ernouf captured was the British Royal Navy schooner , an Adonis class schooner of 110 tons (bm), that her captor took into Cayenne. She became the French privateer Pératy, which the Royal Navy recaptured her in 1808. Dame Ernouf Dame Ernouf was commissioned in Guadeloupe in late 1807 under Alexis Grassin who had earlier captained Général Ernouf. Under Grassin she was based in Lorient and later in Nantes, from August 1808 to July 1809. On 11 September 1808, Dame Ernouf captured Brutus, of and for New York, Edwards, master.La Nicollière-Teijero, p.428. Brutus was returning from Bengal when she was captured. Her captors sent her into Cayenne where she arrived on 5 October; Brutus was condemned there.Lloyd's List no.4317 – accessed 11 May 2016. Dame Ernouf was recommissioned in Nantes in April 1809. On 17 June Dame Ernouf left Guadeloupe, carrying Madame Ernouf back to France for her health. Dame Ernouf arrived at Lorient on 28 July. On this voyage she captured several British merchant vessels: schooner Antelope and brig Hanna, and the ships Joseph, Swifise [sic], and Diana.La Revue Normande: Histoire, littérature, sciences & arts (1892), Vol. 1–2, pp.222–3. Lloyd's List describes Antelope as a Spanish schooner that Dame Ernouf, of six guns, captured on 17 June as Antelope was sailing from St Thomas's to Martinique.Lloyd's List, no. 4379 – accessed 11 May 2016. A report from Paris dated 1 March 1810 stated that Dame Ernouf had recently arrived at Bordeaux with three prizes, a ship carrying sugar, coffee, and indigo, a brig with cotton, and a ship with oil and cod.Lloyd's List, no.4440 – accessed 11 May 2016. On 24 July 1810 Dame Ernouf captured two Spanish vessels, one sailing in ballast from London to Caracas, and the other carrying ironmongery from Bristol to Cadiz. Dame Ernouf sank the first and sent the second into Brest.Lloyd's List no.4486– accessed 11 May 2016. The next day the West Indiaman , Coulson, master, was returning to London from Martinique and St Lucia when she encountered Dame Ernouf, of 18 guns and 130 men, nine days into a cruise from Brest. Dame Ernouf captured Starling, but hree days later, on 28 July, HMS Seine recaptured Starling off Brest.Lloyd's List №4481. Dame Ernouf was decommissioned in Nantes; she was soon recommissioned as a privateer under the name Diligent.La Nicollière-Teijero, p.431 Diligent Diligent made several successful cruises under Grassin.La Nicollière-Teijero, p.432 From June 1811 to December 1812, Diligent operated from Nantes under Alexis Grassin On Diligent, Grassin had captured six ships by July 1811.

It manned heavy howitzers on the Western Front from 1916 to 1918, beginning with the Attack on the Gommecourt Salient on the First day on the Somme. Mobilisation On the outbreak of war in August 1914, units of the part-time Territorial Force (TF) were invited to volunteer for Overseas ServiceBecke, Pt 2b, p. 6. and most of the Glamorgan Royal Garrison Artillery did so. This unit had mobilised as part of No 26 Coastal Fire Command, responsible for the defence of Swansea, Cardiff and Barry.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 402, 409. By October 1914, the campaign on the Western Front was bogging down into Trench warfare and there was an urgent need for batteries of siege artillery to be sent to France. The WO decided that the TF coastal gunners were well enough trained to take over many of the duties in the coastal defences, releasing Regular RGA gunners for service in the field,WO Instruction No 248 of October 1914. Soon the TF RGA companies that had volunteered for overseas service were also supplying trained gunners to RGA units serving overseas and providing cadres to form complete new units. According to WO Instruction No 181 of December 1915, 96th Siege Battery was to be formed at Pembroke Dock by three officers and 78 other ranks (the establishment of a full company) drawn from the Glamorgan RGA.WO Instructions December 1915.Frederick, p. 702. The battery actually formed on 1 January 1916 with three officers and 90 men from the Glamorgan RGA and 64 recruits from the Pembroke Dock RGA establishment, under the command of Major C.H.M. Sturgis.MacDonald, Pro Patria Mori, p. 172. It went out to the Western Front on 21 May 1916 and joined 19th Heavy Artillery Group in Third Army on 25 May, taking over four 9.2-inch howitzers in existing emplacements near Pommier from 62nd Siege Bty.'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/4.MacDonald, Lack of Offensive Spirit, pp. 106, 172; Appendix 3. War Service=Gommecourt= 9.2-inch howitzer in action on the Somme, 1916. 19th Heavy Artillery Group (HAG) was assigned to support VII Corps' Attack on the Gommecourt Salient in the forthcoming 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme). Its main role was to use the high-angle fire of its howitzers to bombard German trenches and strongpoints facing 46th (North Midland) Division's attack frontage. The specific targets assigned to 96th Siege Bty were 'The Z', 'Little Z' and Pigeon Wood (targets shared with the modern 6-inch 26 cwt howitzers of 101st Siege Bty), the Gommecourt village end of Oxus Trench (shared with the obsolete 6-inch 30 cwt howitzers of 102nd Siege Bty), the trenches to La Brayelle Farm, and Ford Trench, all at the left end of 46th (NM) Division's front. Ammunition for the modern howitzers like the 9.2-inch was in short supply, and had to be carefully rationed during the preliminary bombardment. At all times during daylight, No 8 Squadron Royal Flying Corps had a BE2c observation aircraft in the air spotting fall of shot for 19th HAG's batteries. The howitzers joined in the bombardment on 25 June ('V' Day, four days before 'Z' day, the date set for the attack). The planned rate of fire was 50 rounds per gun on V to X days, then 70 rounds on Y day. Because of poor weather for observation, the attack was postponed for two days, and the additional days (Y1 and Y2) were used for further bombardment. By Y1, two important German communication trenches running back into Gommecourt village (Ford Trench to the British) had been rendered impassable by 96th Siege Bty's shells. One of the pair of German heavy mortars (Minenwerfers) in this sector had been buried by a howitzer shell, and the other withdrawn. But overall, the damage to the German positions was not severe.MacDonald, Lack of Offensive Spirit, pp. 216–21; 265.MacDonald, Pro Patria Nori, pp. 172, 188.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, p. 460. A final bombardment began at 06.25 on Z Day (1 July), with 65 minutes of intense fire before H Hour at 07.30. Of 96th Siege Bty's guns, No 1 fired 120 rounds, No 2 114 rounds, and the other two 90 rounds each, and the battery reported that the oil in the guns' hydraulic recoil buffers had boiled.MacDonald, Pro Patria Mori, p. 258. At 07.30 the guns lifted onto their pre-arranged targets in the German support and reserve lines as the infantry got out of their forward trenches and advanced towards Gommecourt behind a smoke screen. The attack of 139th (Sherwood Foresters) Brigade on the left, south of The Z was initially successful, the leading waves getting into the first German trench albeit with heavy casualties, and some parties entered the second line. But they were hit by enfilade fire from The Z, even though the RFC observers reported British troops in the Z and Little Z. 96th Siege Bty's Forward Observation Officer (FOO), Captain W.R. Brown, also thought that he could see British troops in this part of the line. Smoke and mist made observation difficult, and some of the German troops were wearing the 'coal scuttle' helmet (Stahlhelm) for the first time, so the observers were probably mistaken. The result, however, was that no further shelling from 96th or the other RGA batteries was brought down on the Z positions. Fire from these positions prevented 139th Brigade's follow-up waves and ammunition carrying parties from crossing No man's land. The attack had been halted by 09.00 and the leading attack waves were destroyed or driven out of their small gains by the end of the day.MacDonald, Pro Patria Mori, pp. 358–422, 456–7.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 467–71. The Gommecourt attack had only been a diversion for the main attack of the First day on the Somme, and it was not renewed after the failure on 1 July. Third Army was not involved in any major operations for the rest of the year. 96th Siege Bty remained in 19th HAG during the summer, but the practice was to move batteries and HAG headquarters around as required, On 18 October the battery transferred to 48th HAG, then on 28 November to 46th HAG, and then was directly attached to VII Corps Heavy Artillery from 27 December to 6 January 1916. It briefly rejoined 46th HAG, then went to 39th HAG before joining 54th HAG on 23 January.'Allocation of HA Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92–98. =1917= On 21 March 1917 the battery moved to join 59th HAG in Fifth Army. The German army was in the process of retreating to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich), which entailed much repositioning of British guns. Fifth Army then attacked the Hindenburg Line during April and May 1917 (the Battle of Bullecourt).Becke, Pt 4, pp. 114–20. Positioning a 9.2-inch howitzer and its ammunition in the mud of the Ypres Salient, 1917. On 10 July 1917 the battery left 59th HAG and moved to 15th HAG in First Army, arriving on 13 July. During the summer First Army was involved in the Battle of Hill 70 at Lens. From 22 August, 96th Siege Bty came under the command of 2nd Canadian HAG while the Canadian Corps was heavily engaged in the Hill 70 fighting. For the rest of the year the First Army front was a quiet sector, and 96th Siege Bty left on 5 October, moving back to Fifth Army, where it joined 36th HAG on 11 October. Fifth Army was fighting the last stages of the Third Ypres Offensive: the First and Second Battle of Passchendaele. Conditions for the artillery were very bad: British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and suffered badly from counter- battery fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74–8.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 211–13.Wolff, pp. 223–35, 249–51. =1918= 96th Siege Bty returned to the command of First Army at the end of the year, joining 91st HAG on 14 December. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 they were converted into permanent RGA brigades. Unlike most RGA batteries, 96th Siege Bty had not been raised to the higher establishment of 6 guns during 1917, and remained a 4-gun battery of 9.2-inch howitzers until the end of the war. It was the heavy component of 91st (9.2-inch Howitzer) Bde, RGA, along with three 6-inch howitzer batteries, which served with First Army until the end of the war.Farndale, Western Front, Annex E.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M. The battery got a period of rest from 5 to 26 February 1918, and then served through the defensive battles of the German Spring Offensive, 91st Bde RGA seeing much action with IX Corps on the Aisne.Farndale, Western Front, p. 283. It was then with First Army during the Allied advances of the Hundred Days Offensive – the Second Battle of Arras, Battle of the Canal du Nord, Second Battle of Cambrai, and Battle of the Selle before the Armistice with Germany ended the fighting in November. In the interim order of battle for the postwar army the battery was supposed to form 167th Bty RGA, but this was rescinded after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and the battery was disbanded in 1919.

It moved to Aldeburgh in 1870, changing its name to Eaton House and then Aldeburgh Lodge. The school finally moved to its present location of Nacton in 1937, being renamed again as Orwell Park. During World War II, the school was evacuated, first to Devon, and then Shropshire. As part of preparations for the D-Day landings, Orwell School was used by the 7th Armoured Division (The Desert Rats) as a training location due to its sloped terrain leading down to estuary of the River Orwell. Whilst originally admitting only boys, girls were first accepted in 1992. History buildings According to Pevsner, the main school building dates to c. 1770, built by the family of Admiral Edward Vernon. It was acquired by Colonel George Tomline in 1848, who proceeded to extend and modify the building and grounds. Most notably, this included the addition of an observatory containing a 26 cm refracting telescope, known as the Tomline Refractor, that is still in use today. Other than the main school building itself, there are other grade II listed buildings nearby, such as the Water Tower, Orangery and Clock Tower. The Pre-Prep classrooms are in a separate, purpose-built building, completed in 2013. Sports and other activities The usual range of sports are offered at the school, for both boys and girls, including: rugby, hockey and cricket, with football, golf, sailing, skiing, swimming and tennis also available. The School runs the Orwell Park Challenge for older pupils to promote personal development outside of the classroom. Orwell Park School has forged links with Mayo College in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India, with staff and pupils from both schools undertaking several exchange visits over the past few years.

The British captured her in 1803. She sailed to Australia. There she became the flash point that led to the Rum Rebellion and the military coup that overthrew Governor William Bligh. She was lost in 1808. Career Paramatta entered Lloyd's Register in 1804 with Campbell, master, Hulet & Co., owners, and trade London–(New) South Wales. The entry showed her launch year as 1798.Lloyd's Register (1804), Supple. pages \\"P\\", Seq.№P57. Subsequent issues of the Register of Shipping and Lloyd's Register make clear that she had been captured in 1803. Captain John Campbell acquired a letter of marque on 26 December 1804.

Parramatta, Glenn, master, arrived at Port Jackson on 3 April 1807 with merchandise from England. John Macarthur and Garnham Blaxcell became the owners of Paramatta. In July she sailed for Tahiti with a stowaway aboard, an escaped convict named James Horne. In Tahiti, rather than detaining Horne, Glenn arranged for him to go aboard an English vessel, General Wellesley. When Paramatta returned to Port Jackson Governor William Bligh demanded that the £900 pound bond that Paramatta (£800), Macarthur (£50), and Blaxcell (£50) be forfeited. (All vessels and their owners had to post bond when leaving Port Jackson that they would not take any people out of the Colony without the Governor's permission.) Macarthur refused to comply and the ship was seized. In December 1807 Bligh had an order issued for Macarthur to appear before the courts, which Macarthur refused to obey. He was arrested and bailed for a trial on 25 January 1808. This trial led to the so-called Rum Rebellion, when the officers of the New South Wales Corps, who constituted the court, sided with Macarthur and his allies: as a consequence, the Corps overthrew Bligh in a military coup on 26 January. Parramatta sailed from Port Jackson for the last time on 14 April 1808 bound for the Fejees. Loss In late April or early May, Parramatta was wrecked at Cape Brett, New Zealand, after making a hasty departure from the Bay of Islands. The crew survived the wreck but were captured and killed after a violent exchange with local Māori. Parramatta had called at the Bay of Islands in distress. When local Māori asked for payment for the food they had provided to her the crew threw them overboard and fired upon them. As she sailed from the Bay Parramatta wrecked on rocks near Cape Brett. Māori killed all the crew and plundered the schooner. Lloyd's List reported on 1 May 1810 that the schooner Paramatta had sailed from Sydney on 20 April 1808 and had not been heard of since.Lloyd's List №4454.

Overview The site contains the ruins of a large manorial estate established in 818 AD by Emperor Kanmu to Crown Princess Asahara and was inherited by her daughter Princess Sakahito. It was then donated to the great temple of Tōdai-ji in Nara. After several centuries, the estate came under control of the Zen temple of Tenryū- ji in Kyoto. The ruins of the Heian period manor house was discovered in 1970 during construction of an industrial park. The foundation pillars for a large house, presumably the administrative building of the manor and a number of warehouses were discovered, along with wooden tags and shards of pottery. The main building was surrounded by a cloister-like covered corridor, in the manner of contemporary temples. The site is now a public archaeological park, with concrete pillars marking the locations of foundation posts. From 1984 to 1991, a site called the on a riverside in what is now part of the city of Kanazawa was excavated.

It manned heavy howitzers on the Western Front from 1916 to 1918. Mobilisation On the outbreak of war in August 1914, units of the part-time Territorial Force (TF) were invited to volunteer for Overseas ServiceBecke, Pt 2b, p. 6. and most of the Glamorgan Royal Garrison Artillery did so. This unit had mobilised as part of No 26 Coastal Fire Command, responsible for the defence of Swansea, Cardiff and Barry.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 402, 409. By October 1914, the campaign on the Western Front was bogging down into Trench warfare and there was an urgent need for batteries of siege artillery to be sent to France. The WO decided that the TF coastal gunners were well enough trained to take over many of the duties in the coastal defences, releasing Regular RGA gunners for service in the field.WO Instruction No 248 of October 1914. Soon the TF RGA companies that had volunteered for overseas service were also supplying trained gunners to RGA units serving overseas and providing cadres to form complete new units. War Service=1916= 121st Siege Battery, RGA, was raised at Pembroke Dock on 22 March 1916 under Army Council Instruction 701 of 31 March 1916 with a cadre of 3 officers and 78 other ranks from the Glamorgan RGA. It went out to the Western Front in July 1916, manning four 9.2-inch howitzers. It joined I ANZAC Corps in Fifth Army on 15 July in time for the Battle of Pozières in the Somme Offensive. It transferred to 5th Heavy Artillery Group (HAG) in Second Army on 4 August, then returned to the Somme with 28th HAG in Fourth Army on 14 September. The Battle of Flers-Courcelette was launched the following day and largescale fighting continued on Fourth Army's front into November. 121st Siege Bty transferred to the command of 64th HAG within Fourth Army from 3 October.Frederick, pp. 703–4.'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/4.'Allocation of HA Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1.Army Council Instructions March 1916.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 114–20.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 102–9. =1917= 9.2-inch howitzer in action on the Somme, 1916. 121st Siege Bty came under the command of 18th HAG on 15 April 1917 as that group transferred from Fourth to First Army, which was engaged in the Arras Offensive. The battery transferred to the command of 57th HAG on 14 May as the Arras operations wound down. It left 57th HAG on 10 June and joined 53rd HAG on 17 June as First Army continued minor operations.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74–8. On 9 July 1917 the battery moved to 24th HAG (alongside 172nd Siege Bty, also raised by the Glamorgan RGA), which was attached to the French army. The group then joined Fifth Army on 1 August, just after the start of the Third Ypres Offensive. Fifth Army's guns were suffering badly from German counter-battery (CB) fire, and the offensive bogged down. A second push on 16 August (the Battle of Langemarck) suffered from rushed artillery planning and was unsuccessful.Farndale, Western Front, p. 264. Positioning a 9.2-inch howitzer and its ammunition in the mud of the Ypres Salient, 1917. On 16 September the group was transferred to Second Army when that formation took over control of the faltering offensive: the Battles of the Menin Road, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde were highly successful because of the weight of artillery brought to bear on German positions. But as the offensive continued with the Battle of Poelcappelle and First and Second Battles of Passchendaele, the tables were turned: British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and were subjected to CB fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 82–9.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 211–13.Wolff, pp. 223–35, 249–51. 121st Siege Bty had received reinforcements on 5 September, when it was joined by a section from 428th Siege Bty, just arrived from Home. This was in preparation for the battery to be expanded to six 9.2-inch howitzers, but the guns do not seem to have arrived at this time. Second Army HQ and 24th HAG were sent to reinforce the Italian Front in November, but after the horrors of Passchendaele 121st Siege Bty was given an extended rest from 16 November to 5 December, nominally under the command of 6th HAG. It appears to have received its two additional howitzers during December, and returned to the Fifth Army front on 7 December as part of 5th HAG, transferring to 98th HAG on 28 December. =Spring 1918= 121st Siege Bty had another period of rest from 31 January to 19 February 1918. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 they were converted into permanent RGA brigades. For the rest of the war the battery was part of 98th (9.2-inch Howitzer) Bde, RGA, along with three 6-inch howitzer batteries.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M. Fifth Army was attacked on 21 March 1918, the first day of the German Spring Offensive. Artillery Observation Posts (OPs) were blinded by early morning mist and many were overrun along with the infantry in the forward zone. Much of the field artillery was lost, caught up in short-range fighting in the main battle zone, as were a number of RGA units either caught in the fighting or forced to abandon their guns as the Germans advanced rapidly. Others struggled to get their guns back during the 'Great Retreat'.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 259–79. Fourth Army HQ took over all of Fifth Army's formations and units on 2 April, and the first phase of the German offensive was halted on 4 April. Further attacks came on other parts of the front, but none broke through completely. =Hundred Days= 9.2-inch howitzer broken down into three loads for road movement. Fourth Army launched the Allied counter-offensive (the Hundred Days) with the Battle of Amiens on 8 August. The artillery fireplan emphasised CB fire for the 'heavies' as well as bombarding villages and strongpoints. The heavy artillery was positioned as far forward as possible, and it was prepared to move up behind the advancing infantry.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 287–93. By the end of September Fourth Army had closed up to the Hindenburg Line. On 29 September IX Corps carried out an assault crossing of the St Quentin Canal, with 98th Bde amongst the mass of artillery supporting the operation. The canal defences had largely been destroyed by the heavy guns, which continued firing on the canal banks until the last possible moment as 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade stormed the outpost line and then scrambled across the canal in the morning mist. The objectives were taken by 15.30.Blaxland, pp. 232-7.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 101–6. On 8 October, IX Corps attacked the next German defensive position, the Beaurevoir Line. Harassing fire (HF) had been carried out on the night of 6/7 October, and all through 7 October and up to Zero the heavies carried out CB fire and shelled important localities. Once the attack went in the heavies continued intense CB and long-range HF fire until the infantry were on the objective. The RGA brigades were ready to follow up the advance, but without their cumbersome 9.2-inch howitzers.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 189–92. On 11 October preparations began for IX Corps' assault on the German line along the River Selle. CB fire began on 13 October, together with bombardment by the heavy howitzers of important localities chosen by Corps HQ. On 15 and 16 October mist and rain disrupted air reconnaissance, but Zero for the Battle of the Selle was fixed on 16 October for 05.20 the next day. The first day of the battle went well, one German counter-attack being broken up when all available guns were turned onto it, but the attackers were still short of their objective, the Sambre Canal. Steady progress was also made on the second and third days as Fourth Army closed up to the canal.Blaxland, pp. 251–2.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 295–305, 318, 325.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 307–9. IX Corps renewed its advance on 23 October, with 98th Bde part of a massive corps artillery reserve. The attack went in at 01.20 in moonlight, after the heavy guns had done the usual CB and HF bombardments, and the result were extremely satisfactory.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 352–61. As the regimental historian relates, 'The guns of Fourth Army demonstrated, on 23 October, the crushing effect of well co-ordinated massed artillery. they simply swept away the opposition'.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 311–2. After a pause to regroup and reconnoitre, IX Corps stormed across the canal on 4 November (the Battle of the Sambre). After that the campaign became a pursuit of a beaten enemy, in which the slow-moving siege guns could play no part. The war ended with the Armistice with Germany on 11 November.Blaxland, pp. 254–6.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, pp. 386–8, 463–71.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 318–20. In the interim order of battle for the postwar army the battery was supposed to form 156th Bty RGA, but this was rescinded after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and the battery was disbanded in 1919.

They were established in 1943. Although the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia had been completed at the time of their founding, the Imperial General Headquarters saw the need for flexible countermeasures to defend strategic islands in the Pacific Ocean from impending Allied invasion as the war situation deteriorated for the Japanese Empire. The Amphibious Brigades should not be confused with the Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF) of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Structure The Amphibious Brigades were almost identical in structure to the IJA Amphibious Regiments, which had received additional training for amphibious operations. They were not assigned any heavy artillery or transport vehicles, which made mobility on land difficult to impossible. The lack of transport was compensated by a larger than normal ammunition allocation. The brigades each had 35,643 grenades for their 81mm mortars and 7,445 grenades for their 75mm guns. The individual amphibious brigades organized as follows: Brigade staff (9 x amphibious vehicles) *3 Infantry battalions ** 3 infantry companies ** 1 artillery company (3 × 75 mm Mountain Guns and 2 × Infantry Guns ) **1 mortar company each (12 × 81 mm mortars) **1 sapper company **1 Anti-aircraft company (6 × guns) **1 Armored company (9 × light tanks) **1 Engineering company ** 1 Communication company **1 Medical and sanitation company Landing and support vessels 150 Daihatsu-class landing craft *10 SS-class landing ship *10 Type 4 MGB \\"Ka-Ro\\" (fire support) However, the planned target strength with respect to the SS-class landing craft and MTBs was never achieved. =IJA 1st Amphibious Brigade= The was created in 1943 and dissolved in 1945. Its tsūshōgō code was “Storm 3139” ( 駆3139, Kakeru 3139 ). The 1st Amphibious Brigade was established on 16 November 1943 under the command of Lieutenant General Yoshimi Nishida out of the Manchukuo-based IJA 3rd Independent Garrison Unit. In mid-December 1943, the brigade embarked and arrived shortly afterwards at Truk, where it was placed under the IJN 4th Fleet. Imperial General Headquarters assigned it to Eniwetok to counter an expected Allied invasion: however, the brigade lost in the sinking of the Aikoku Maru at Truck on 17 February 1944 during Operation Hailstone. Another 800 men, including Lieutenant General Nishida were annihilated during the Battle of Eniwetok from 17–23 February 1944 by the United States Marine Corps. The remaining men and transports were sent to Palau and were incorporated into the IJA 53rd Independent Mixed Brigade in May 1944. =IJA 2nd Amphibious Brigade= The was created on 16 November 1943 and dissolved in 1945. Its tsūshōgō code was “Patrol3189” ( 巡 3189, Meguru 3189 ). Although it was not planned to set up the 2nd Amphibious Brigade until 1944, the schedule was advanced to November 1943 due to the success of the Allied Operation Cartwheel. The 2nd Amphibious Brigade was established out of the Manchukuo-based IJA 5th Independent Garrison Unit with the staff from the IJA 29th Division. On 11 April 1944, the 2nd Amphibious Brigade was assigned to the Southern Expeditionary Army Group and was sent to the Philippines in May, but without their armored company. It was then transferred in June to the Vogelkop peninsula in western New Guinea, where he came under the command of the IJA 2nd Army. En route, its supply vessel was sunk by an American submarine, causing the loss of most of its ammunition and many rifles. During the Battle of Biak from 27 May – 17 August 1944 it was to be sent as reinforcement to the beleaguered Japanese garrison; however, it lacked the transport to reach the island. The 2nd Amphibious Brigade remained in Sorong for the duration of the war, where, weakened by malnutrition and disease, it surrendered in August 1945. Some 180 members of the brigade who survived the sinking of the supply ship were stranded in Zamboanga and were killed during the Battle of Mindanao. =IJA 3rd Amphibious Brigade= The was created in May 1944 and dissolved in 1945. Its tsūshōgō code was “Thunder 12630” ( 轟 12630, Todoroku 12630 ). The formation of the 3rd Amphibious Brigade took place in May 1944 under the command of Colonel Ikeda Einosuke in Shumshu in the Kuril Islands from elements of the Chishima 1st Reserve Group. It was structured identically as the 1st and 2nd Amphibious Brigades. In 1945, it was placed under the command of the IJA 27th Army, and was part of the last-ditch defense of the Japanese archipelago against an anticipated American landing. It was transferred to Hokkaido, followed by Aomori. During the transfer, the transport carrying Colonel Ikeda was sunk by an American submarine, and he was replaced by Colonel Kurashi. On 1 May 1945 it was placed under the command of the IJA 40th Army and transferred to Kyushu, although a portion was sent back as part of a garrison force for Paramushir in the Kuriles. On 23 May 1945 the brigade was dissolved and its men and equipment reinforced the IJA 125th Independent Mixed Brigade, which ended the war in Kagoshima Prefecture. =IJA 4th Amphibious Brigade= The was created in May 1944 and dissolved in 1945. Its tsūshōgō code was “Expelling 12630” ( 攘15582, Harau 15582 ). The formation of the 4th Amphibious Brigade took place in May 1944 under the command of Major General Torihiko Mineki in Asahikawa, Hokkaido and was structured identically as the 1st and 2nd Amphibious Brigades. Its staff force and three infantry battalions came from the IJA 7th Infantry Division, however, its armored company was based in Morioka and its artillery company was located in Kokura, Kyushu. It was placed under the command of the IJA 27th Army, and was initially assigned to the defense of Iturup in the Kuril islands, but it lacked proper transport and logistics support. In May 1945, it was withdrawn to Honshu and please under the IJA 36th Army as part of the last-ditch defense of the Japanese archipelago against an anticipated American landing. It was based at Saitama Prefecture as part of defenses of Tokyo and was assigned to the IJA 1st Armored Division, but was used exclusively for road maintenance work and to grow crops. The brigade headquarters was at Sakura, Chiba at the end of the war. Literature *Underwood, John: The Japanese Order of Battle in World War II. Vol. I.

Early life  A Zakia was born in Lorrain Ville, in the Saikho village of Mizoram in 1930. He completed his schooling from the Government Middle School of the same village.  Career  After completing his education in 1952, he joined the government school where he studied as a primary school teacher. He retired as a school teacher after 44 years of service in 1996. Apart from teaching in school, he worked as a news editor for various publications and magazines, and retained key editorial positions in various organisations. He has authored more than ten books in the Mara language, including Children’s Bible and Mara Grammar. The Board of Mara Literature approved the Mara Grammar book for common use and as a standard text in schools. Between 1993 and 1996, the Board of School Education of the Mara Autonomous District Council made A Zakia the official translator of primary school text books. His contributions led to the upliftment of Mara literature, at a time when the Mara language was slowly losing its existence due to the influence of English language and other dialects of the nearby tribes. According to ISL International, there are only 50,000 Mara speaking population remaining, and thus, it has been classified as an endangered language. In 2018, the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind, conferred upon A Zakia the Padma Sri award for his contribution towards the upliftment and preservation of the endangered Mara language. He became the first person among the Mara tribe to receive the award.

It was built during 1860. It is also known as Rockpool Restaurant (former); and William Blue Dining. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The subject site was part of the first hospital grounds from 1788; by 1790 a new prefabricated hospital replaced the earlier tent hospital. By 1800 there were three structures in use for the hospital and it appears the subject site lay between the most northerly hospital building and the assistant surgeon's house which stood on the south-west corner of Argyle and George streets. The hospital store building may have extended over this the subject site. By 1812 some small, single-storey buildings occupied the site; these could have been the store houses for the hospital. In 1816 the new Rum Hospital opened in Macquarie Street, the original hospital on George St was demolished and the site became a government stone quarry. The site was later granted to Mr Broughton, who appears to have given it to his wife, Elizabeth, as it is her name that is notated on later maps. The Broughtons did not build on the land until 1832 or 33 when they erected a dwelling and a shop. In November 1841 the land was subdivided and offered for sale, it was divided into four Lots, Lot 1 is the present 109 George Str, Lot 2 is 107 George Street. The plan for the auction shows that there was a shoe shop on Lot 1 and a structure marked as Mr Bradley house and shop on part of Lot 1 and along the street frontage of Lot 2. This single storey two roomed shop had wooden walls and a roof of timber shingles. Broughton sold Lot 2 (no. 107) to John Donohoe in 1842 who immediately erected a single storey wooden bakehouse timber shingled roof. It appears that Donohoe purchased both Lots as he is indicated as the owner in 1845 on the rates records, the first year they were collected. In 1854 Patrick Freehill purchased Lot 2 in 1854 and Lot 1 in 1856. Freehill erected a bakehouse and store to the rear of his two properties during 1857. The stone store with timber shingles was three storeys and contained ovens and stables. The lower sections of walls still remain. In 1860 P. Freehill erected a four-storey (inc. basement) buildings to on both Lots. The southern half of this building was described in Sydney Municipal Rate Books of 1863 as a public house constructed of stone walls and slate roof. Freehill retained the rear store and bakehouse of Lot 1 but conveyed the public house known as \\"The Shipwrights Arms\\" to Reverend P. Young in 1868. Freehill mortgaged his property to the Bank of New South Wales in 1874 and in 1876 the \\"Official Insolvency Assignee Alfred Sandeman\\" conveyed the property to the Bank. The premises remained a hotel called \\"The Shipwrights Arms\\" until 1900 when the name changed to the \\"Chicago Hotel\\" and Margaret Riley licensee. Nos. 107 and 109 George St were resumed by the Government in 1901, these buildings survived the demolitions that occurred around the area because of their substantial nature and relatively young age. Around 1910 the Hotel on 109 George Street became a fish shop and later a café. 107 George Street was a clothes shop between 1900 and the early 1920s, initially run by Mrs K. Symonds and then W. H. Kent and Co. After that it became a hairdresser. By the 1960s, 107 George Street contained a laundry and a museum with residential apartments in the upper levels and 109 was a restaurant known as The Rocks Push. The building has undergone extensive remodelling during the last half of the 20th century, in 1978 the Rocks Push Restaurant expanded into 107 George Street requiring extensive renovations including the removal of the party wall between the two properties. In the same year the central section of the top floor sandstone George Street façade was reconstructed due to structural failure. In 1980 the shopfront of 107 George Street which was remodelled in the 1920s was reconstructed to match the existing original at 109 which was also restored. After 1985 the original residential entrance doors were removed from both buildings and replaced with fixed glazing and the paint was also removed from the sandstone façade. Rockpool, pictured in 2010. The building were again extensively remodelled on the ground floor for the opening of the Rockpool restaurant by Neil Perry, Rockpool opened in February 1989. In 2009 the building underwent internal and external conservation works and a replica sandstone carved pediment was reinstated onto the roof. the tenant was William Blue Dining, a 60-seat student-run restaurant that provides vocational students from the William Blue College of Hospitality Management with the opportunity to learn up-market food and beverage service skills in a live environment.  Description  Construction at 107–109 George Street commenced in 1861 on the three-storey, plus basement and attic, masonry buildings. These buildings are constructed of sandstone on the George Street façade and unrendered brick at the rear. The north façade of 107 and south façade of 109 have a smooth ashlar-jointed rendered brick finish. The party wall between the two buildings is of brick construction. There is a hipped roof over each property with two rendered brick chimney stacks, each with six pots, straddling the common wall. A single-storey section at the rear of both buildings incorporates some earlier, 1857, sandstone walls with a new rendered brickwork parapet wall above. The roof structure of this section was built as part of the 1988 interior design for the Rockpool restaurant. In 1988 the architectural firm, D4 Design undertook the refurbishment of the ground and first floors of 107–109 George Street for Neil Perry, Chef, of the Rockpool restaurant.Godden Mackay 1999:33 Style: Renaissance Revival; Storeys: 3 + Basement; Roof Cladding: Iron; Floor Frame: Timber. = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed.

The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The buildings at 107–109 George Street are an integral part of the fabric of The Rocks and associated with all key phases of its history, from the establishment of the colony. A particular association lies with the importance of the harbourside of Circular Quay to the commercial precinct of The Rocks in the mid 19th century. The building is a very fine representative example of commercial buildings designed in a mid-Victorian Regency style that also reflects a strong degree of confidence in this area at the time of its construction by its owner, Patrick Freehill. The architectural design qualities of the buildings and their previous use as a combined shop and residence, for which evidence remains, provide rarity value for these buildings. They were built in 1861 by Patrick Freehill and have had a continual commercial use since they were built. The surviving fabric has the ability to yield information on early building techniques as well as the way of life for the inhabitants. The rear section of the property incorporates the ground floor sandstone wall of a former two-storey stables/bakehouse. The buildings use since the 1970s as a restaurant continue the commercial history of the site and also reflect the growth of The Rocks area as a tourist destination. It is also as an early example of the restoration work of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. The Rockpool restaurant is a long running iconic Sydney restaurant that contributes to the character of The Rocks as an international tourist destination. The site at 107–109 George Street is a place of high archaeological research potential. Should sub-surface archaeological resources remain intact, the site is likely to yield important evidence of material culture that contributes information about the development and occupation of The Rocks area that is unavailable from other sources. Shop, Rockpool Restaurant was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The buildings at 107–109 George Street have historical significance for the site is reasons: Nos. 107-109 George Street is located on a site that was integral in the early development of the colony, being associated with the first hospital and later an early quarry. 107–109 George St is representative of the nature of development of privately built and owned commercial properties found in The Rocks in the mid-19th century as part of the development of the northern end of George St as a commercial centre associated with the maritime activity of Circular Quay. Located within The Rocks business precinct these buildings are associated with a period of growing commercial confidence in New South Wales. The building, with its fine sandstone construction and design, is a good representative example of this phase. The history of the site reflects The Rocks generally. Starting as part of the site of the Colony's first hospital, its early development reflects the first commercial developments on George St and in the Nurses Walk area before their consolidation and more intensive development in the middle part of the 19th century. The refurbishment of the building was one of the first undertaken by the then Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, a significant phase in The Rocks in the late 20th century. The combined uses of commercial premises with residences over is a typical pattern for this mid 19th century period within The Rocks. Nos. 107–109 George Street is typical of the private waterfront properties resumed by the Sydney Harbour Trust in the early 20th century. The buildings have had a continuous commercial use since they were built in 1861. They have been predominately used as a hotel and bakery in the 19th century and as a barber and restaurant throughout the 20th century. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The buildings at 107–109 George St are significant due to the following reasons: The site is located in the historic Rocks precinct, which is associated with the convict settlement of Australia as the earliest area of Sydney to be developed. The site on which 107–109 George St is located is associated with the first hospital in Australia. The site is located on George Street, the earliest and longest operating business precinct in Australia, with 107–109 operating as a commercial premises continuously since construction in 1861. The site is associated with early activities of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and was one for the first building restored by the Authority. The site is associated with significant restaurant establishments in Sydney, The Rocks Push restaurant in the 1970s and since 1988, Rockpool under head chef Neil Perry. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The buildings at 107–109 George Street have aesthetic significance for the following reasons: The buildings display a high quality architectural design typical of the Victorian Regency style, such as its symmetrical façade, decorative sandstone parapet and restrained classical detailing. 107–109 George Street has streetscape value as being located in a row of commercial premises between Argyle and Globe Streets, in the historic Business Precinct of The Rocks, with similar scale, detailing and alignment to the street. Except for the loss of the original verandah, the street façade of the buildings has remained relatively intact since it was constructed in 1861. Although the Rockpool restaurant interior design of 1988 obscures heritage fabric and spaces it is also of some aesthetic significance as representative of post-modern design influences on interior design and architecture. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The buildings at 107–109 George Street have social significance for the following reasons: The Rocks area is an area of Sydney that is well visited by locals and tourists. It has been the subject of many planning schemes and when threatened with demolition, articles in the press, public meetings and representations demonstrated how highly regarded this area is to the locals, people of Sydney and visitors. Much has been written on the importance of The Rocks as an example of an accumulation of urban artefacts which together present the growth of the area. The Rockpool Restaurant has become an icon of Sydney dining with Neil Perry as Head Chef over the last two decades. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The buildings at 107–109 George Street have Technical/ Research significance for the following reasons: The fabric, although modified has the ability to yield information on the configuration of early Victorian commercial residential buildings and aspects of the way of life of the people who inhabited them. The site has potential to contain subsurface archaeological deposits associated with occupation of the area from the early settlement period in The Rocks. The site may contain evidence of successive phases of use as a bakery from the mid nineteenth century. Archaeological deposits and features, particularly when considered in conjunction with documentary evidence, can provide evidence of material culture that yields information which may be unavailable from documentary sources alone. If present, remains of occupation from as early as the early 19th century on the site would comprise an archaeological resource which might contribute data that leads to a better understanding of the social, economic and cultural history of Sydney and The Rocks area in particular. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The buildings at 107–109 George Street have comparative rarity significance for the following reasons: The intact sandstone façade to George St is a very fine example of mid- Victorian Regency architecture and a rare example of this style applied to commercial buildings constructed by individual developers of this period. The buildings retain elements of a combined shop/residence, once commonly found in the business district, but now rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The buildings at 107–109 George Street have representative comparative significance for the following reasons: 107–109 George Street is representative of the nineteenth-century urban fabric that is found at The Rocks. They are a representative example of early Victorian commercial properties built in the Victorian Regency Style. The buildings have been continuously occupied for commercial retail purposes since construction in 1861. The building's scale, detailing and alignment to the street is typical of that found along the west side of George Street and lining the harbourside as part of the Business Precinct of The Rocks. The buildings are part of the rich fabric of The Rocks which is highly regarded by residents, Sydney people and visitors and acknowledged by the Australian Heritage Commission and the National Trust as part of The Rocks Urban Conservation Area. The potential archaeological resource on the site is representative of the continuous occupation of The Rocks from early colonial settlement, through the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries and into the present and provides an opportunity to consider a range of questions related to change and development of the site. Archaeological evidence from the site has the potential to contribute to the evolving and layered history of this significant area of Sydney.

It then changed command rapidly: to 19th HAG on 4 October, to 8th HAG on 18 October, then to 47th HAG on 24 November and back to 8th HAG on 8 January 1917, all with Third Army, whose front was quiet during this period.'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/4.'Allocation of HA Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1. Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92–98.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92–8. War Service=Arras= On 24 March 1917 the battery transferred to the command of 46th HAG and then to 35th HAG on 3 April as Third Army prepared for the opening of its Arras Offensive. A larger force of guns than ever before had been assembled for this battle, and 35th HAG was assigned with seven other HAGs to VII Corps.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 164–9. The battle opened on 9 April and was widely successful, the counter- battery (CB) fire of the heavy howitzers having been effective. But following up the success was difficult. Batteries had to move up to get back into range (No man's land in VII Corps' sector had been wide) and the Germans re- positioned their guns, so the effectiveness of the prepared CB fire was lost. The offensive quickly bogged down.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 170–4. =Ypres= 6-inch howitzer being moved through mud on the Western Front. After the Arras offensive ended in May 1917, 172nd Siege Bty was rested from 28 May to 10 June. It then rejoined Third Army, serving with 39th and 8th HAGs. Third Army's front was quiet during the summer of 1917, but on 9 July the battery moved to 24th HAG (alongside 121st Siege Bty, also raised by the Glamorgan RGA). 24th HAG was attached to the French army, but it joined Fifth Army on 1 August, just after the start of the Third Ypres Offensive. Fifth Army's guns were suffering badly from German CB fire, and the offensive bogged down. A second push on 16 August (the Battle of Langemarck) suffered from rushed artillery planning and was unsuccessful.Farndale, Western Front, p. 264. 6-inch howitzer and crew during the Ypres offensive, 1917. 172nd Siege Bty received reinforcements on 26 August when it was joined by a section from 415th Siege Bty, just arrived from Home. This allowed the battery to be brought up to a strength of six 6-inch howitzers. On 16 September 24th HAG was transferred to Second Army when that formation took over control of the faltering offensive: the Battles of the Menin Road, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde were highly successful because of the weight of artillery brought to bear on German positions. But as the offensive continued with the Battle of Poelcappelle and First and Second Battles of Passchendaele, the tables were turned: British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and suffered badly from CB fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 114–20.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 82–9.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 211–13.Wolff, pp. 223–35, 249–51. =Italy= After the disastrous Battle of Caporetto on the Italian Front, Second Army HQ and several of its sub-formations were sent to reinforce the Italian Army. 24th Bde RGA left with XIV Corps on 17 November 1917, arriving on 25 November. Its guns went into action on the Montello Hill, supporting the Italian army holding the line of the River Piave, which had been critically short of heavy artillery. The situation was stabilised by the end of the year, but XIV Corps and 24th HAG remained in Italy.Becke, p. 215.Falls, pp. 89–92, 131–2, 143.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 176–7.Campbell, p. 96.Thompson, pp. 328–30. Apart from some CB shoots, there was little activity through the winter months.Farndale Forgotten Fronts, p. 183. In February 1918 the HAGs became permanent RGA brigades: 24th Bde consisted of one heavy battery (1/1st Warwickshire Bty) and three other 6-inch howitzer siege batteries (105th, 229th and 247th) in addition to the 172nd.Campbell, pp. 93–4.Farndale Western Front, Annex E. At the end of March 1918, 105th Siege Bty moved to a position south of the Asiago plateau supporting VIII Italian Corps. The gunsites were in wooded mountainous terrain and the guns had to be manhandled into position. They carried out trench bombardment while awaiting the next Austrian offensive (the Second Battle of the Piave River). This finally came on 15 June. Despite some initial Austrian gains, 48th (South Midland) Division held its main positions. The British heavy howitzers systematically destroyed the Austrian guns on the Asiago, notwithstanding poor visibility early on (Royal Air Force observation aircraft were able to direct the fire later) and the Austrian offensive failed all along the front.Campbell, pp. 97–100.Shepard, in Campbell, p. 125.Falls, pp. 157–67.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 184–8.Thompson, pp. 344–7.Kurt Peball, 'The Piave: Austria's last Throw', Purnell's History of the First World War, Vol 7, No 6, pp. 2833–8.Philip Warner, 'The Piave: Italian Counterattack', Purnell's History of the First World War, Vol 7, No 6, pp. 2839–47. Preparations then began for the final battle on the Italian Front, the stunning success of the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. The British were relieved in the Asiago sector and moved to join the British-commanded Tenth Italian Army near Treviso. 24th HAG supported a number of British and French raids during September and October, then on 23 October the preliminary attacks began, supported by 24th HAG's howitzers. The main British assault crossed the River Piave on 27 October, with the heavy guns engaging all known Austrian gun positions and providing a protective barrage on either flank. A bridge was ready by 29 October and the heavy guns crossed the river. By 1 November the Austrian army had collapsed and the pursuing British troops had left their heavy guns far in the rear. Austrian signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November, ending the war in Italy.Campbell, pp. 101–4.Falls, pp. 169-77.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 189–92.Thompson, pp. 356–64.Franco Velsecchi, 'Vittorio Veneto', Purnell's History of the First World War, Vol 7, No 14, pp. 3064–71. After the Armistice, 24th HAG was involved in securing prisoners and captured artillery. Demobilisation of the batteries in Italy began at Christmas 1918 and they were disbanded by the end of March 1919.Campbell, pp. 106–19. FootnotesNotesReferences * Maj A.F.

Description  Calotes bhutanensis was first described by biologist B. Biswas in 1975 through a single specimen. It was described as having frontal region in a slightly convex, fewer supra- and infralabials than other lizards in its family. Its shoulder was described to have an oblique fold in front of the shoulder. There were fewer rows of scales and most dorsal body scales were pointing backwards and downwards. It also had distinctly swollen tail base with enlarged scales in males. The species is similar in biology and physiology to the oriental garden lizard. In a sub-adult male, the tail can grow to a length of 15 mm and the snout-vent length can reach 60 mm. The head of the species has a length that is 50% longer than the width. On the skull are two separate spines on each side of the back of the head. From the lower jaw run four lines on the chin and throat. There are 12 upper labials and 11 lower labials. The breadth between two anterior eye corners corners more than the eye corner, and makes the lizard have the appearance of being snub-nosed or short-snouted. No gular pouch is observed but in lieu of this, the throat is inflatable, enabled by some smaller and narrower scales in the middle of the neck than the side. For protection, the neck has a row of 8 scales on the sides of the neck. On the sides of the body, there are numerous black patches that can be transverse, wavy, or variegated in pattern. They give the appearance of wavy lines. The third and fourth fingers are nearly equal in length but the fourth is longer.  Distribution  C. bhutanensis is endemic to Bhutan and was named after this country. It is mainly found near the Manas River. Calotes bhutanensis is generally restricted in habitat to their locality, that is an area of no more than 10 kilometers squared.

The tekke is a large complex, now largely ruined, near the village of , on the banks of the Pineios River. In Byzantine times, the settlement of Lykostomion occupied the site, but the modern settlement grew up around the tekke, and until the 20th century was named Baba after the founder of the tekke, Hasan Baba. Following his death, Hasan Baba became known as a miracle-worker, and the tekke became a site of pilgrimage for faithful from all over the Ottoman Empire, particularly by women who wanted to conceive, and children that could not walk. A large monastic complex of the Bektashi order grew around the türbe (mausoleum) of its founder, including a square mosque with a minaret, quarters for the dervishes and pilgrims, and large kitchens. The main surviving structure is the türbe, a square structure with sides 5.9 m long and 9 m high. It is roofed with a brick dome, supported by an octagonal drum and covered with leaden sheets. It originally featured a porch covered in three small domes, but it collapsed in 1930, after the marble capitals of its columns were removed. The interior was originally covered in plaster, decorated with inscriptions from the Quran, which are partly preserved, and floral patterns in white on black background. The türbe is dated to the late 14th or early 15th centuries, while a square annex on its eastern side dates to the late 17th century. The building of the kitchens also survives, while most of the surrounding area has been given over to the village of Tempi for its cemetery, or has been converted to fields. The ruins of the mosque, whose appearance is known from the depiction of Edward Dodwell, are to the northwest of the türbe. Since 1987, the türbe is under the purview of the 7th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities, and plans for a full-scale restoration of the monument were laid down in 2009. Limited restoration work has been undertaken to support the structure, but it is not open to the public.

It was built during 1914. It is also known as part of a Duty Free Store complex. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  145-151 George Street, The Rocks, undated. As indicated by James Meehan's Survey of 1807 this site was first occupied by Surgeon General John White at Lot No. 4 and Captain William Raven at Lot No. 5. In Mrs Underwood was the owner of three storey stone shops and houses each with seven rooms. By 1845 a two-storey brick house and shop with a shingle roof and five rooms was built. Also on this same allotment at the corner of George and Globe Streets a two-storey stone and brick house and store was erected. The five roomed house had \\"every convenience\\". In 1861 this building was used as a \\"Bowling Alley\\" managed by William Ogilvie. In 1871 in the tenements erected by Underwood, a public house was opened called the \\"Nil Desperandum Hotel\\". By 1882 three two storey tenements were erected between the butcher shop and the brick and stone shop on the north side of the Public House, now known as the New York Hotel. These shops and dwelling were constructed of brick and they were roofed in iron. In 1891 the building to the south corner of Globe and George Streets was pulled down. By 1891 George McEvoy had erected houses to the Harrington Street frontage. The four storey buildings were of brick and stone and the roofs were slated but these houses were pulled down in 1906. In 1892 a three-storey brick and slate roofed shop and dwelling was erected for the Trustees of the Church of England to 145 George Street. In 1900 the area was resumed under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act. The New York Hotel was demolished in 1907 and by 1908 Tooth & Co. Ltd. erected the brick and iron roofed building to 153/155 George Street. In 1912 the tenements to 149 and 151 George Street were pulled down, and in the same year a two-storey brick office building was erected to the rear of 145 George Street. During 1913 Quay Chambers at 149-151 George Street were erected. The tenement to 147 George Street was demolished in 1914 and in that same year the present three storey brick building was erected. The site was identified as having European occupation since at least 1791, with other structures by 1822. From then on, site development was intense. In the 1890s, and following the Resumption in 1900 the current buildings facing George Street were constructed.  Description  It is a simple but imposing three storey dark face brick building constructed in 1914 in a Federation Free Classical style replacing an existing tenement demolished as part of the slum clearances. Its prominent feature is a large semi-circular double storey verandah opening which was dramatically altered by the construction of a semi- circular awning/entrance in the 1980s redevelopment. The building uses small amount of sandstone in the capping to the gable parapet and keystone. The shopfront with a central entry and tiling to waist height, which existed during the Nicholas occupation in the 1930s had been modified by the 1980s. The 1980s redevelopment completely removed the shopfront to create a double level entrance to the modern development at the rear of the site. = Modifications and dates = *DFS complex: 1988 (the redevelopment involved the demolition of the rear of the George Street buildings, the removal of interior and the creation of new shopfront). *In 1914 to 157-159 George Street Nathan Jacobs erected the New York Theatre. The New York Theatre was demolished in 1937. This site was acquired by the Public Transport Commission in 1946 and the City Circle Railway was opened in 1956. *In the late 1980s the site was developed with a large commercial historic building erected behind 145-155 George Street whilst the facades of the building were adapted.  Heritage listing  As at 19 November 2008, 147 George Street was constructed in 1911, a part of a group of four buildings, and has State Heritage significance for its historic and social values. 147 George Street has historic significance at State level for having been the site of early European settlement, continuously occupied by Europeans since 1788. The site has historic significance at local level for its associations with several phases of 20th century urban renewal. Firstly, the demolition and rebuilding of much of The Rocks under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act following the 1900 plague outbreak; secondly, an association with infrastructure works including the construction of the Cahill Expressway and the City Railway link, which dramatically changed the visual curtilage of the group; and lastly, the 1980s creation of The Rocks as a tourist destination, when the interior and rear of the building was altered to accommodate a Duty Free Store (DFS) Complex. 147 George Street forms part of a group of four commercial buildings (Nos 145, 147, 149-151 & 153-155 George Street) which front George Street and form the eastern portion of the DFS Complex. This group of buildings, bounded by Globe Street and the Cahill Expressway, mark George St's southern entry to The Rocks precinct. The facades of the four late 19th century and early 20th century buildings, have streetscape qualities and character that contribute to the overall richness of a coherent and harmonious brick and stucco group of buildings located within The Rocks. The subject building also has local significance in its use of the arch as the dominant feature of the east elevation. The significance of the subject site and the group is associated with its location in The Rocks, a precinct unique to NSW and its historic associations and streetscape character and qualities that contribute to The Rocks area, which has State heritage significance in its own right. The group is an important part of The Rocks Heritage Conservation Area being sympathetic in scale and character and an extension of the remaining earlier buildings of George Street, presenting a unified streetscape. The buildings are tangible evidence of the redevelopment of The Rocks in the last decade of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, the period before and after the plague outbreak. 147 George Street has high social significance as a contributory element associated with the historic character of The Rocks, which is held in esteem by the local community and to the people of NSW. 147 George Street was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. 147 George Street, The Rocks has associations as a built element within George Street. George Street was the first road created in NSW and is thus the oldest road in Australia. The history of George Street (north) and its uses & changes since 1788, illustrate and inform the aspirations and way of life of Europeans in Australia. The Rocks was impacted by the plague of 1900. The Observatory Hill Resumption Act resulted in the resumption of large tracts of land. Post-plague re-development of The Rocks saw the demolition of a large number of buildings and the construction of new buildings that met health standards and requirements. 147 George Street was impacted by the urban development as were the other buildings in the group of four (except 145 George Street). 147 George Street has moderate significance at local level associated with the provision and retail of fish to the local area, continuously operating on the site for almost 70 years. As a part of the district of The Rocks it has association with maritime use and the sale and consumption of fish. 147 George Street has moderate significance at local level for its associations with the phase of redevelopment of The Rocks in the 1980s when the precinct was transformed into a major tourist attraction. As part of the development works in the 1980s a western portion of the building was demolished and a false wall with arched arcade opening constructed, the West elevation that faces onto an open gallery. At the time of the redevelopment the original awning and shopfront were removed and a new awning constructed. 147 George Street is a three-storey face brick building located within a block bounded by Globe Street and the Cahill Expressway overpass. The building was erected around 1911 as shops and offices. Stylistically, the building is an example of a Federation Free Style building. The sandstone gable, keystones and the use of face brick is typically Federation detail. The item meets this criterion at State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The item does not exhibit any associations with a notable person or a group of persons from the local or wider NSW history. The item does not meet this criterion. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The East Elevation of 147 George Street, The Rocks, has been modified substantially below the 2nd floor and has little significance at a local level. The East elevation on the second floor and above has high significance at local level associated with its level of intactness of external elements and as a representative example of a commercial building in The Rocks designed in the Federation Free Style. The single arch, providing the dominant design element of the elevation, is rather unusual and contrasts with the small openings usually associated with masonry construction of this era. While the changes to the elevation carried out in the 1980s are considerable, they have utilised the design element of the arch in keeping with the character of the late 19th and early 20th-century streetscape elements conserved within the building group, and reflect the aesthetic approach of its time. 147 George Street has high significance at local level associated with a group of buildings between the Cahill Expressway and Globe Street, comprising 145, 147, 149-151 & 153-155 George Street, with landmark qualities. On entering the precinct from George Street this group of buildings is the gateway to The Rocks. The scale of the group contrasts with the modernist brutalism of the Cahill Expressway and the 20th-century modernist buildings located around Circular Quay and the central business district. The backdrop of the DFS building does not diminish the picturesque quality of the group. The West elevation of 147 George Street is a façade designed as part of the 1980s DFS development as such contributes to the loss of design integrity. The interior of the building was removed in the 1980s redevelopment and little evidence of the architectural planning or fabric is retained internally. The item meets this criteria at the local Level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Rocks, in general, has considerable significance to the general community of Sydney and people of NSW as a heritage precinct. The fight to \\"Save The Rocks\\" was a significant battle for the local residents and the community. The Rocks is a highly visited tourist area; visited by Sydneysiders and international tourists for its historic character and associations as a remnant of the area first settled in Sydney. The Rocks, of which the subject site forms part, is important to the community's sense of place. As an element within The Rocks, 147 George Street, provides a sense of place that is integral to the area as a whole and is subsequently held in esteem by the local community. Shopping is a major activity within The Rocks area. As the first commercial district of Sydney relating directly to the ports and shipping, the area has developed a strong commercial focus, which is currently maintained by tourism. The subject site has maintained its historic association with shopping and retail. The item meets this criterion at a State level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The earliest and most substantial phase of building on the subject site and in close proximity occurred by 1822. These earliest buildings, located along the George Street frontage, comprised the Underwood buildings, and adjacent shop to the north and Thomas Moore's house. Archaeological evidence from a series of cottages erected on the southern section of the site during the 1820s-30s has probably been removed by later 19th and 20th-century developments. It is highly unlikely that intact evidence still remains in the archaeological record because of building works prior to 1893 and the DFS development works in the late 1980s. The item does not meet this criterion The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 147 George Street is relatively unusual at a local level, for the use of an arch as such a dominant feature of its façade. It is also unusual for the 1980s intervention, significantly modifying the ground and first floor levels, not only physically but also in its use, perhaps as a \\"bold\\" approach reflective of its time. As the ground floor had been previously degraded with vehicular access, there was a rationale for using this narrower section of the block as a main entry point for the whole DFS development, thus enabling the ongoing commercial use of the whole block. The item meets this criterion at a local level The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The shops and shopping district of The Rocks are representative of the continued commercial use of the area, and the change to tourism. 147 George Street is one of a group of shop buildings that operated in The Rocks from the end of the 19th century until the late 20th century. 146 George Street is a representative example of this group. This item meets this criterion at a local level.

Cannon Hall Museum, Barnsley Frances, Baroness Byron (later Hay; ; c.1702 – 1759), was the second daughter of William Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley of Stratton (died 1740/1), and his wife Frances Temple (died 1707).G.E.

She was the third wife of William Byron, 4th Baron Byron and a great-grandmother of the poet Lord Byron. Lady Byron was one of 21 women of influence who signed Thomas Coram's petition of 1729, which led to the foundation of the Foundling Hospital. She is also known for sitting for the eighteenth-century artist William Hogarth (1697–1764), whose painting has been exhibited at the Foundling Museum, near Brunswick Square in London, as part of their \\"Ladies of Quality\\" exhibition. Life and marriages Frances was born in April 1703, the second child of four daughters and three sons born to William Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley of Stratton and Frances Temple. Her baptism took place on 9 April at St Martin in the Fields, Westminster. On 3 December 1720, Frances Berkeley married William Byron, 4th Baron Byron (1669–1736), as his third wife. It was a financially beneficial match arranged by her father, who wrote on 1 November 1720, \\"I am going to dispose of one of my daughters to Lord Byron, a disproportionate match as to their ages, but marriages not offering every day, I would not miss this opportunity ... though attended by never so many inconveniences\\". At their marriage Frances was just 17, and Lord Byron was 51. During this marriage, Frances had six children: *Isabella Byron (1721–1795), wife of Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle * William Byron, 5th Baron Byron (1722–1798) * Vice-Admiral John Byron (1723–1786) * Reverend Richard Byron (1724–1811) * Charles Byron (1726–1731) * George Byron (1730–1789) Frances is identified in John Faber's engraving after a Hogarth portrait of 1736,National Art Collections Fund Annual Review, 1993, pp.87-88. made before her husband Lord Byron died on 8 August 1736. It was \\"through her second son John [that Frances was] the great-grandmother of Lord Byron, the poet\\". Four years after her first husband's death Frances remarried, to Sir Thomas Hay, Bt. (c.1698 – 1769) of Alderston, as his second wife, in 1740. There were no children from this marriage, and Frances predeceased Sir Thomas.Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. Page 1838. Frances died, most likely in East Lothian, on 13 September 1757, and was brought for burial at the Berkeley family vault at St Mary's Twickenham on 21 September. In her will she left any property to her husband, making no mention of her children.  Role in the Foundling Hospital  alt= In 1735, Thomas Coram presented his first petition to King George II, aiming to facilitate the building of a Foundling Hospital. Frances, among 21 women of influence, signed this petition. Frances personally signed on 14 April 1730. The support of these women was one of innovative thought and vision, that not only triggered a catalyst for the further two petitions in 1737, that was ultimately successful. A Royal Charter was finally granted in 1739, calling upon 375 male signatories, yet excluding the ladies who were the facilitators of this success. Frances is thought to have been influenced by her friend, Anne Newport, Baroness Torrington, who signed the petition on the same day. Frances' participation led to the involvement of her son, William Byron, 5th Baron Byron (1722–1798), in the Foundling Hospital in October 1739, who is listed, alongside Hogarth, as a prominent governor. However it is considered that William's role of authority was unsympathetic to the cause, as he is notoriously represented as \\"the 'wicked Lord', [who] encumbered the estate, sold off much property and the family pictures in the 1770s\\".  Identity in Hogarth's painting  Although details around the commission for William Hogarth's portrait of Lady Byron remain unclear, Lord Byron is thought to have subscribed to Hogarth's Rake's Progress. Historians can also decipher that the portrait was produced six years after Frances signed Coram's petition for the Foundling Museum. Interestingly, at the same time Hogarth is painting Frances, two further petitions are being organised for presentation, which ultimately receives Royal Charter in 1739. As noted in William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of Paintings, Frances is \\"shown walking in a park, looking at the viewer with pale grey-blue eyes, pulling on a glove with her left hand\\". Another feature of the portrait is the depiction of her \\"black and tan terrier\\" with an emphasised grey muzzle that is considered to allude to her elderly husband.

He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Hawaii under the reign of Liliuokalani. During times of political upheaval and financial stress of Hawaii's changing governments, Robinson joined with other business men to come to the financial aid of the government. Early life Known professionally as M. P. Robinson, he was born July 4, 1852, in the Kingdom of Hawaii. He was the eldest son, and fifth of nine children, born to British immigrant John James Robinson (1799–1876) and Rebecca Prever (1817– 1882), a descendant of Hawaiian chiefess Kamakana. Business interests In 1875, Robinson and his brother-in-law S. C. (Samuel Clesson) Allen of Kauai formed the Allen & Robinson Lumber Company and became engaged in the operation of inter-island sailing ships. With other partners he formed Marshall, Campbell & Robinson, which operated a fleet of inter-island side-wheel paddle steamers. Robinson was an investor in Hawaii sugar plantations, and helped found the First National Bank. He partnered with Benjamin Franklin Dillingham, S. C. Allen, James Bicknell Castle, Robert Lewers and John H. Paty in 1889 to establish the Oahu Railway and Land Company. Robinson was the rail company's first treasurer, and one of its steady customers in shipping produce from his banana plantation to buyers. During the 1900 Bubonic Plague epidemic, much of Honolulu's Chinatown was destroyed by fires that were ignited by the Territory of Hawaii Board of Health in an attempt to eradicate the source of the plague. The immediate resulting damage claims overwhelmed the territorial government's ability to reimburse property owners. Pending funding from the United States government, Robinson was one of several business owners who advanced money to the territorial government for claims settlements. Politics Robinson was a member of the House of Nobles of the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii for the Special Session of November 3, 1887 – May 28, 1888, Special Session of May 29 – September 11, 1888, and the 1892 Legislative Session of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Although a supporter of the monarchy, Robinson took exception with the Walter M. Gibson cabinet expenditures and schemes during the reign of King Kalākaua. He became a member of the Committee of Safety that drafted the Bayonet Constitution of 1887 which codified the legislature as the supreme authority over any actions by the monarchy. During the reign of Queen Liliʻuokalani, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from November 8, 1892 to January 12, 1893 under the George Norton Wilcox cabinet which had political inclination toward the Reform Party. This cabinet was ousted by the legislature and he was replaced by the queen with Samuel Parker, shortly before the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17. Claus Spreckels, who had close ties with the monarchy, loaned $95,000 to the Provisional Government of Hawaii. Robinson joined with other business men to finance a repayment of the loan, to prevent Spreckels from having leverage in any counter revolution to restore the monarchy. Robinson served on the Republic of Hawaii Council of State under President Sanford B. Dole. Family and death Rebecca Prever was the second wife of John James Robinson. With his first wife, he had children both his own and one step-daughter. Below are the nine children born to Rebecca Prever and John James Robinson: *Robert (1853–1854) *John Lawrence Newcomb (1861–1890), wed chiefess Caroline Kapu-ai- ana-hulu Johnson (1854–1937) of Kona. *Mary (1844–1930) wed Thomas R. Foster – Foster Botanical Garden was their homestead, bequeathed to the city of Honolulu upon her death. *Victoria (1846–1935) wed Kentucky-born Curtis Perry Ward, who had ties to Liliʻuokalani and Hawaii's royal court. The couple bought a coconut plantation and built a 2-story home they named \\"Old Plantation\\". Following Ward's 1882 death, Victoria oversaw the plantation operations for the next half century. Composer David Nape and Ward family friend Mary Jane Montano wrote the tribute song \\"Old Plantation\\". The first known recording was by Peter Kalani in 1916, but it has since been recorded by numerous artists.; ; *Bathsheba (1849–1914) wed Samuel Clesson (S. C.) Allen from Boston. Known as \\"Aunt Batty\\" to her nieces and nephews, she inherited the bulk of Allen's $2,000,000 estate after his 1903 death. In widowhood, she became a philanthropist. Upon her own death in 1914, her estate was estimated at slightly under $1,000,000. *Matilda A. (1851–1937) wed William E. Foster, the nephew of her sister Mary's husband Thomas R. Foster. *Annie (1855–1921) wed Albert Jaeger, a German immigrant who was appointed Hawaii's commissioner of the Bureau of Forestry. He became a manager at Allen & Robinson Lumber Company. *Lucy (1858–1943) wed Dr. Albert McWayne *M. P. Robinson wed Sophia Louisa Campbell (1851–1888) of New Jersey in 1877. After her death at age 36, he never remarried. They were the parents of three sons: :*James Lawrence Prever (1880–1947) was trustee of his father's estate, and a founder of the Hawaiian Broadcasting System. He wed Lilla May Ripley (1879–1969). The couple had no children. :*Mark Alexander (1882–1955) managed the Robinson estate. With his first wife Agnes Armour (1887–1942), he had four sons and two daughters: Mark Prever II, James Allen, Charles Armour, John Alexander, Susanna Louise and Kaikilani Kamakana. In 1945, he wed Mary Kapuahualani Hart (1896–1978). He had no children with her. She was subsequently elected to the Hawaii Territorial Senate, and founded Robinson Travel, Inc.; :*Allen Campbell (1885–1926) was employed in managerial positions at Trent Trust Co., and C. Brewer & Co., and was the founder of Bergstrom Music Company. During World War I, he served as an American Red Cross Captain in England and Russia. He never married.; After a lengthy period of insomnia that drove him to the brink of insanity, Robinson killed himself on April 2, 1915. He left a note for his son explaining his actions. At the time of his death, he belonged to several fraternal organizations, including the Freemasons, Scottish Rites and the Knights Templar.; * His estate was estimated at $419,720.23, mostly land and other investments. A Canadian broker had been in negotiations in 1910 to put Robinson's private library on the auction block. At the time, it was said to be one of the most extensive libraries in a private collection. The deal was never completed, and the library was estimated at $57,000 at the time of his death.; The following are the children of John James Robinson and his first wife. They are a half-brother and two half-sisters to Mark P. Robinson: *Caroline Tauwati Robinson (1815–1921) of Tahitian-Hawaiian ancestry, she was the step-daughter of John James Robinson, from his first wife's previous marriage. Known as \\"Wati\\" or \\"Watti\\", she married Robert William Holt, her step-father's business manager, and related through marriage to Liliʻuokalani's husband John Owen Dominis.; *James J. Robinson (1826–1896) lived at north Kona. His wife's name was Kekapa.; *Charlotte Robinson (1828? -1913) married Richard Coady at Washington Place in 1852. After his death, she married Dr. E.

She was known as “the Lady of the Lamp” in the coal fields of Yorkshire.  Early life and education  Monica Maurice was born in Hucknall Torkard, near Nottingham, and brought up in the industrial north Midlands, the eldest of three daughters. Her father was William Maurice (1872–1951), founder of the Wolf Safety Lamp Company, a manufacturer of safety lamps for mining and quarrying; he had purchased the business rights from Friemann and Wolf of Zwickau, Saxony, Germany, in 1910. She and her sisters were all educated at a pioneering co-educational preparatory school at Grindleford, Derbyshire, and at the independent school Bedales in Hampshire, where she studied from 1922 to 1927; she was head girl there in 1926. As her son William wrote in her obituary, she had a talent for languages and design and continued her studies at the Sorbonne, in Paris, and at Hamburg University; 'even as a young girl there was a steely determination to be successful'. She completed her education at Mrs. Hoster's Commercial Training College, London, where she acquired 'a first-class knowledge of office management and qualified as a shorthand writer and typist in three languages'.  Career  Her long and distinguished career began in February 1930, first as secretary to her father at the company, where she also studied the technique of electric mine lamp design, the manufacture of alkaline storage batteries, and maintaining installations in efficient running order, among other aspects. In 1931 she was apprenticed as an engineer in Germany with the former parent company, , then the world's largest and most celebrated firm of mine lampmakers. She trained in the drawing office, laboratory, machine shops and foundry, among other departments. For practical experience, she also visited the coal mines of Westphalia. She made several other visits to Germany throughout the 1930s, and on one occasion 'she wandered into a restricted zone and saw what she thought was a guidance system. This she reported to the British authorities on her return, but they were not interested. At the outbreak of war though, she was summoned to London for a three-day debriefing. All this experience, her knowledge of technical German and her familiarity with many of the industrial sites proved invaluable.' The Wolf Safety Lamp Company in Heeley In 1932 Monica was made a director and a departmental manager of her family's company, with responsibility for the planning and successful operation of vast numbers of lamps at collieries in every important coalfield in the UK. This was the start of a career that continued over sixty years until her retirement in 1992. In 1934 she was elected a Director of the Wolf Safety Lamp Co. (Wm. Maurice), Ltd; she was later Managing Director from 1951 to 1979 and Chairman from 1951 to 1988. In 1930 she gave a paper on 'Mines and Miners in Art and Letters' (in French) at the Congres International des Mines, de la Metallurgie et de la Geologie Appliquee, at Liege, France, which was subsequently printed in the congress's Proceedings. In 1931 she attended the meetings of the International Conference of Illuminating Engineers during their first visit to England. In July 1935 she deputised for her father at another meeting of the same organisation, held in Berlin and Karlsruhe, Germany, and played an active role in promoting arrangements for the establishment of an international standard of lighting for mines. She joined the Women's Engineering Society (WES) as a member in 1935 and organised the fourteenth annual conference for WES in 1936 in Sheffield. She was the second woman (after Caroline Haslett) to be elected a Companion of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and in 1938 became the first – and until 1978 only – female member of the Association of Mining Electrical Engineers. During World War II, while production at the Wolf factory continued, Monica served on the British Standards Committee for mine lamp bulbs, personal safety and safety footwear, along with standardisation of screw threads during wartime. In 1947, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, she took part in a British intelligence overseas survey mission to Germany to determine the extent and subsequent recovery in certain specialised industries. According to her obituary, during this visit her group were reporting their arrival at a town near Cologne 'when an arrogant young British captain dismissed their request for accommodation and supplies. She came forward and quietly suggested that she might be forced to pull rank and suddenly rooms were available in the local hotel, as well as fuel and rations for the onward journey.' In 1975 Monica Maurice was appointed OBE. In later life she lived in Ashford in the Water in the Peak District of Derbyshire, and died on 20 September 1995. Her son John Jackson became Chairman of the company and two grandsons, Miles Jackson and Alex Jackson, also work for Wolf Safety.  Personal life and interests  Monica Maurice married a Canadian doctor, Arthur Newton Jackson (1904–1985), on 18 June 1938, the Chapel of Our Lady on Rotherham Bridge in South Yorkshire; they had two sons, William and John, and one daughter, Willa. At her wedding she wore a fashionable red silk gauze dress, a bold choice for the time, and which is now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. She had a passion for cars and planes, qualified as a pilot in early 1935, and was the first woman in Sheffield to obtain the 'A' certificate of the Air Ministry. Maurice was known for her insistence on a high level of cleanliness in the lamp rooms she managed and once told a story against herself. Staff had discovered she was learning to fly and a lamp man said “you know, I don’t know ‘as I ‘old with this ‘ere flying. One time I used to know when Miss Maurice was in the district, and now where never I ‘ears an aeroplane I comes over all of a sweat like and starts polishing.” In December 1935, The Woman Engineer noted that she 'is now practising advanced aerobatics as weekend recreation. Incidentally, she is a good horse-woman and keen on swimming and dancing.' Her obituary recorded that she also had an insatiable passion for cars and that by the 1930s she would race a friend to the York Aviation Flying Club at Sherburn in Elmet, North Yorkshire, of which she was a member. She was a friend of the aviator Amy Johnson, delivering a speech proposing her for re-election as President of WES in 1936. Miss Maurice's portrait was painted by Slade educated artist Janet Patterson in the 1980s after she visited her at Wolf Lamp Company offices on Saxone Road, Sheffield. It shows her sitting in her office at the company works. The watercolour hung in Miss Maurice's office for some time and was later exhibited in the Morley Gallery in London and in the former Mappin Art Gallery in Sheffield in 1986. Sheffield Museums Trust acquired the painting for their collection in 2017 and it is currently on display in the Graves Art Gallery in Sheffield. Patterson is married to Maurice's son William.

From 1919 she studied at the Toonkunst music school in Utrecht and her first compositions – three songs, a string quartet, and three piano pieces survive from 1920. In 1921 she wrote a second quartet, a piano quintet, a parody opera, and a pastorale for orchestra. In 1925 she completed only a piano trio and a choir piece. Insecure and disillusioned she decided to stop composing. She took an office job and composed only sporadically. In October 1938 Stants married Leendert Sillevis from Culemborg, a widower fourteen years older than her. She began to compose again: a concerto grosso for flute, cello and string orchestra in 1940 and a suite for small orchestra in 1942.

It became popular in the 2010s with the growing impact of the internet on everyday lives. The technique is often considered to be born from the found footage genre. According to Timur Bekmambetov, a computer screen film should take place on one specific screen, never move outside of the screen, the camerawork should resemble the behavior of the device's camera, all the action should take place in real time, without any visible transitions and all the sounds should originate from the computer. After producing one the first mainstream feature- length computer screen films, Unfriended, in 2014, Bekmambetov inaugurated Screen Life, his umbrella term for films produced using the desktop interface. \\"Desktop documentary,\\" a sub-genre of desktop film, was coined by Kevin B. Lee and colleagues at the School at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2015. They define desktop documentary as a form of filmmaking that \\"uses screen capture technology to treat the computer screen as both a camera lens and a canvas. Desktop documentary seeks both to depict and question the ways we explore the world through the computer screen.\\" Desktop documentary may be considered the subset of computer screen films that deal with real-life material rather than a fictional narrative world.

The company is based in Halle (Saale), but its head office is in Leipzig. The Mitteldeutsche Verkehrsverbund is a so- called mixed transport association (Mischverbund). Its shareholders are the public authorities (e.g. the administrative districts) (51%) and the transport companies (49%). The aim of the MDV is to make it easier for everyone in Mitteldeutschland to travel by local trains, S-Bahn, tram and bus. The MDV already offers a uniform ticket system and is working on a coordinated timetable. History The association was introduced with a uniform tariff system on 1 August 2001 in four administrative districts and the two cities, and has since been expanded several times: on 1 August 2004, the last unaffiliated administrative districts in Saxony were included, and on 1 August 2005, Altenburg, the area of the former GDR district of Leipzig, which is still strongly oriented towards Leipzig, was completed in the MDV. Negotiations on the accession of the Bitterfeld district were also started shortly after its introduction, but have not been successful to date.

It was built from 1913 to 1913. It is also known as part of the Duty Free Store complex. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  149–151 George Street, The Rocks, pictured at left, with awning W. A. Grubb, undated. James Meehan's Survey of 1807 indicates that the subject site was first occupied by Surgeon General John White at Lot No. 4 and Captain William Raven at Lot No. 5. In Mrs Underwood was the owner and perhaps builder of three storey stone shops and houses each with seven rooms. By 1845 a two- storey brick house and shop with a shingle roof and five rooms was built. Also on this same allotment at the corner of George and Globe Streets a two-storey stone and brick house and store was erected. The five roomed house had \\"every convenience\\". In 1861 this building was used as a \\"Bowling Alley\\" managed by William Ogilvie. In 1871 in the tenements erected by Mrs Underwood, a public house was opened in today's No. 155 George Street, named the \\"Nil Desperandum Hotel\\". By 1882 three two storey tenements were erected on the north side of the Hotel, which was at this time known as the New York Hotel. These shops and dwelling were constructed of brick and they were roofed in iron. In 1891 the building to the south corner of Globe and George Street (now 145 George Street) was demolished. In 1892 a three-storey brick and slate roofed shop and dwelling was erected for the Trustees of the Church of England at 145 George Street. In 1900 the entire Rocks area was resumed under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act after the outbreak of the bubonic plague. The New York Hotel was demolished in 1907 and by 1908 Tooth & Co. Ltd. Built the last New York Hotel, a brick and iron roofed building at 153/155 George Street. In 1911 the tenements to 149 and 151 George Street were replaced by the current building which became known as the Quay Chambers. W. A. Grubb is the longest tenant on the site, a butchering company with stores throughout Sydney. They operated at 147 George Street from 1905 until 1910 and when 149–151 George Street was built, they moved into those premises in 1912, remaining there until the 1980s when the site was redeveloped. The buildings just south of the subject site were demolished in 1937 and the site acquired by the Public Transport Commission in 1946 for the City Rail Link to Circular Quay, the line became operational in 1956. In 1986 plans for the development of the site, comprising 145–155 George Street and 60 Harrington Street were developed. The proposal was for the development of the Harrington Street portion of the site. The development included the construction of a ten-storey office block with retail on the ground floor and an underground carpark. The development included changes to the commercial buildings facing George Street with new shopfronts and the reconfiguring of 147 George Street as an arcade entrance for the Duty Free Store (DFS). In 1998 further development work was undertaken on the Duty Free Store including retail fit outs the removal of a barrel-vaulted awing and the reinstatement of the current flat awning.  Description  It was erected in 1913 as \\"Quay Chambers\\" and is also a face brick three storey building with typical Federation period characteristics; face brick, sandstone banded dressings and keystone and gabled parapet. Other features include a stone bracketed cornice and use of decorative metal work in the rainwater goods and awning support brackets. There are strong similarities in the way that the double level balcony opening is designed to that in the adjacent 147 George Street. In both cases the floor slab between levels is designed to emphasise the double height opening. W. A. Grubb & Co. butchers were the first tenants of the building, occupying the shopfront for many decades. The appearance of the shopfront was later modified by the conversion of a central door bay into a window and the application of tiles up to the window sill line, prior to complete removal and reconstruction as part of the mid-1980s redevelopment. Also removed at this time was the awning which had a soffit lining of Wunderlich pressed metal which also appears to have continued onto the adjoining awning at 147 George Street.

No archaeological work appears to have been undertaken for this site although the 1986 Assessment indicated a potential, and important, resource.

Investigation: Historical research and assessment of archaeology: destroyed. = Modifications and dates = *DFS complex: 1988 (the redevelopment involved the demolition of the rear of the George Street buildings, the removal of interior and the creation of new shopfront). *In 1914 to 157–159 George Street Nathan Jacobs erected the New York Theatre. The New York Theatre was demolished in 1937. *This site was acquired by the Public Transport Commission in 1946 and the City Circle Railway was opened in 1956. *In the late 1980s the site was developed with a large commercial historic building erected behind 145–155 George Street whilst the façades of the buildings were adapted.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, 149–151 George Street was constructed in 1911–12, a part of a group of four buildings and are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. 149–151 George Street has historic significance at State level for having been the site of early European settlement, continuously occupied by Europeans since 1788. The site has historic significance for its associations with several phases of 20th century urban renewal. Firstly the demolition and rebuilding of much of The Rocks under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act following the 1900 plague outbreak; secondly, an association with infrastructure works including the construction of the Cahill Expressway and the City Railway link, which dramatically changed the visual curtilage of the group; and lastly, the 1980s creation of The Rocks as a tourist destination, when the interior and rear of the building was altered to accommodate a Duty Free Store Complex. 149–151 George Street, forms part of a group of four commercial buildings (Nos. 147, 149–151 and 153–155 George Street) which front George Street and form the eastern portion of the DFS Complex. This group of buildings bounded by Globe Street and the Cahill Expressway, mark George St's southern entry to The Rocks precinct. The façades of the four late 19th century and early 20th century buildings, have streetscape qualities and character that contribute to the overall richness of a coherent and harmonious brick and stucco group of buildings located within The Rocks. The subject building also has local significance in its use of the arch as a dominant feature of the east elevation, as well as the clear division of the façade into thirds. The four brick buildings (Nos. 145; 147, 149–151 & 153–155 George Street) of heritage significance, which as a group, provide evidence of two phases of commercial activity in The Rocks just before and just after the plague outbreak and subsequent resumption of land at the beginning of the 20th Century. Although compromised by the loss of rear sections, ground floor interiors and street awnings in the 1980s, it remains a coherent and harmonious brick and stucco group. The buildings are representative of the commercial architecture of the Federation period and the transitional phase prior to the turn of the century. They are tangible evidence of the redevelopment of The Rocks in the early 20th century and also the more recent redevelopment period associated with the SCA. These buildings also provide evidence of historical association with prominent local business such as WA Grubb butchers. The Central Sydney Heritage Inventory contains separate listings for the building façades of 145–151 George Street and the former New York Hotel at 153–155 George Street: \\"Of environmental significance for its contribution to an architecturally diverse and historically important commercial streetscape of heritage significance as physical evidence of the growth and consolidation associated with the maritime activities at Circular Quay\\". The group of four buildings was classified as part of the George Street Business Precinct by the National Trust of Australia in the mid 1970s: \\"A group of four compatible Edwardian buildings containing interesting and lively fenestration which combine to present a picturesque street elevation. The group acts as a sympathetic extension to the remaining earlier buildings of George Street in scale and character to present a unified streetscape\\". The above listings indicate that the primary significance of the group is their contribution to the historic streetscape as well as their aesthetic value as a group of Federation period commercial buildings. The significance of the subject site and the group is associated with its location in The Rocks, a precinct unique to NSW and its historic associations and streetscape character and qualities that contribute to The Rocks area. The group is an important part of The Rocks Heritage Conservation Area being sympathetic in scale and character and an extension of the remaining earlier buildings of George Street, presenting a unified streetscape. The buildings are tangible evidence of the redevelopment of The Rocks in the last decade of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th, the period before and after the plague outbreak. 149–151 George Street was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. 149–151 George Street has associations as a built element within George Street, the Rocks, the oldest commercial centre in Australia. The building has moderate significance at local level associated with a butchery continuously operating on the site from the time the building was completed until its major renovation seventy years later. It also has significance for having purpose-built offices on the first and second floors. 149–151 George Street has moderate significance at local level for its associations with the phase of redevelopment of The Rocks in the 1980s when the precinct was transformed into a major tourist attraction. The building at 149–151 George Street is a three-storey face brick building erected in as a shop and offices. Stylistically, the building is an example of the transition between late Victorian and the Federation periods. The upper parapet, sandstone quoins and keystones are typical of Victorian period detailing, while the use of face brick is more typically a Federation detail. The item meets this criterion at State level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The East elevation of 149–151 George Street has high significance at local level as a representative example of a commercial building in The Rocks designed in the Late Victorian and early Federation style. The building at 149–151 George Street has high significance at local level associated with the intactness of external elements and the retention of late 19th century and early 20th century streetscape elements conserved within the building group between Globe Street and the Cahill Expressway. 149–151 George Street has high significance at local level associated with buildings with landmark qualities, located between the Cahill Expressway and Globe Street, comprising 145, 146, 149–151 and 153–155 George Street. On entering the precinct from George Street this group of buildings contrast with the modernist brutalism of the Cahill Expressway and the 20th century modernist buildings located around Circular Quay and the central business district. The backdrop of the DFS buildings does not diminish the picturesque quality of the group. The West Elevation of 149–151 George Street is a façade designed as part of the 1980s DFS development and as such contributes to the loss of design integrity. The interior of the building was removed in the 1980s development and little evidence of the architectural planning or fabric is retained internally. The item meets this criterion at local level The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Rocks in general has considerable significance to the general community of Sydney and to the people of NSW as a heritage precinct. The fight to save The Rocks was a significant battle for local residents and the community. The Rocks is a highly visited tourist area, both by local and international tourists, for its historic character and associations as a remnant of the area first settled in Sydney. The Rocks, of which the subject site forms a part, is important to the community's sense of place that is integral to The Rocks as a whole and is subsequently held in esteem by the community. Shopping is a major activity within The Rocks area, and as the first commercial district of Sydney relating directly to the port and shipping, the area has developed a strong commercial focus, which is currently maintained by tourism. The subject site has maintained its historic association with shopping and retail. The item meets this criterion at State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 149–151 George Street is relatively unusual at a local level, for the use of a prominent central arch, emphasised by the appearance of the double height balcony spaces. The detailing of the face brickwork in combination with sandstone quoins, as well as the string course and gable, divides the façade into three vertical elements, which gives the building a very distinct configuration. The item meets this criterion at a local level The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The shops and shopping district of The Rocks are representative of the continued commercial use of the area, and the change in commercial demand from ports and shipping to that of tourism. 149–151 George Street is one of a group of shop buildings that operated in The Rocks from the end of the 19th century until the late 20th century. The item is a representative of this group. The item meets this criterion at local level.

Between 1950 and 1954 she was a member of the Central Committee of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), but within the Central Committee she never progressed beyond the candidates' list for Politburo membership. Life=Provenance and early years= Elli Schmidt was born in Berlin-Wedding, an inner city district of the German capital. Her father was a police official. She attended school locally and then, between 1922 and 1926, undertook an apprenticeship in dressmaking. She worked in various Berlin fashion houses during the 1920s, and continued to be employed in the sector till 1932. She joined the \\"Fichte\\" workers' sports association in 1926 and the Young Communists in 1927. In or before 1929 she became a member of the Communist Party itself. She was a member of the local party leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for Berlin-Brandenburg between 1929 and 1932, heading up the \\"Women's Department\\" within it during 1931/32. =Communist and political exile= Schmidt trained for party work at the Comintern's International Lenin School in Moscow between October 1932 and 1934. While she was abroad, in January 1933 the National Socialists took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. By the time she returned home in the Autumn 1934 the Communist Party had been banned and political activity in support of it was illegal. Many comrades had been arrested or fled abroad, and one source describes as illegal her action in returning to Germany. She continued to work illegally in Germany till 1937. In 1934 she was appointed policy-leader and trades union instructor for the underground party operation in the \\"Lower Rhine Region\\" (\\"Bezirk Niederrhein\\"). In 1935, according to one source, she even took on the leadership of the underground Communist Party for Berlin. During July/August 1935 she took part in the 7th (and final) World Congress of the Comintern (which was held in Moscow). She also participated in the German Communist Party's so-called Brussels Party Conference in October of that year. At the Brussels Conference she was elected to the party's Central Committee, remaining a member till the party itself was replaced in 1946. During the National Socialist years she was identified by a party pseudonym as \\"Irene Gärtner\\". There are indications that she was the only woman to be a member of the central committee during this period. She had to flee to Prague in 1937, and from there moved on to Paris where she worked as a member of the Central Committee Secretariat with the German party leadership in exile between 1937 and 1940. In 1940 Schmidt was one of the political refugees who transferred from Paris to Moscow: she remained in the Soviet Union till 1945. When the German launched their invasion in June 1941 she was evacuated to the spa settlement of Lesnoi (Krasnye Baki) on the Vetluga River, returning to Moscow in 1942 after the crisis had peaked. At one stage she worked for \\"Inradio\\". Then from Autumn 1942 she was working with the special German People's Radio (\\"Deutscher Volkssender\\") German-language radio service, later becoming \\"women's editor\\" on it. She also worked with the National Committee for a Free Germany, which was increasingly involved in planning and documenting the plans for the postwar period. =Anton Ackermann= According to one source, during her time in Moscow Elli Schmidt began to live with the comrade generally identified by his party pseudonym as Anton Ackermann, a leading member of the team that would embark on a carefully choreographed nation building programme under the leadership of Walter Ulbricht in the Soviet occupation zone after April 1945. Elsewhere it is stated that the two of them were married back in 1935 when they met as a result of their work in the Comecon. In any event, the two of them lived together as man and wife till 1949, by which time it appears they had at some point formally married. The marriage produced two children, born approximately in 1941 and 1948 respectively. =Mainstream politician after the war in the Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic= Hundreds of thousands of Germans had ended up deep inside in the Soviet Union by the time the war ended in May 1945, mostly as political refugees or as prisoners of war, and for most of them it would take many months or several years before they were able to return. However, on 30 April 1945 a group of thirty men – the so- called Ulbricht Group – arrived from Moscow by plane in Berlin, keen to waste no time in implementing their project for the Soviet occupation zone, a large central chunk of what had previously been Germany, sandwiched between the three \\"western\\" occupation zones and the eastern third of what had been Germany, which was now incorporated into Poland, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Schmidt's partner, Anton Ackermann, was a leading member of that group of thirty men. Elli Schmidt herself returned to Germany in June 1945 at the same time as Wilhelm Pieck. She was still a member of the (no longer banned) Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany. She and Ackermann were two of the sixteen co-signatories of the \\"Communist Party Appeal ... to the German people\\" of 11 June 1945 (still using her party pseudonym, \\"Irene Gärtner\\"). As party structures began to emerge, in July she became a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party Central Committee, and she served during 1945/46 as head of the Communist Party Central Committee's Women's Committee. She also took a leading role in the city politics of Greater Berlin. According to one source she served as a Berlin city councillor between 1946 and 1948. She chaired the main Women's Committee of the Berlin Magistrat (city administrative executive body). During 1945/46 she was a membership of the Communist Party Leadership team (\\"KPD- Landesleitung\\") for the Berlin region. In April 1946 a contentious merger between the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party was implemented. It was clear that the development was intended to apply across the whole of Berlin, and it is not impossible that if matters had turned out differently it would also have extended across the British, French and American occupation zones of Germany. In the event the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) took root only in the part of the country administered as the Soviet occupation zone. As western commentators were quick to point out, over the next few years the SED itself became the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. Elli Schmidt was closely engaged with the project, and was indeed, with Anton Ackermann, a co-author of \\"Grundsätze u. Ziele der SED\\" (\\"Principles and objectives of the SED\\"), a programme for the new party. Between 1946 and early 1954 Schmidt served as a member of the SED Party Executive (Partei Vorstand) and then of the Central Committee which it quite soon became. She was also a member of the party's Central Secretariat. Between April 1946 and May 1949, jointly with Katharina Kern, she headed up the party's Women's Secretariat. Schmidt was a member of the executive board of the Democratic Women's League of (East) Germany (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD) from its launch in March 1947. In 1948 she became chair of the DFD's Berlin branch. The DFD was important: it was one of several government backed mass organisations included in the Leninist political structure that the country had adopted. In order to broaden the structural support and legitimacy of the government, five mass organisations - of which the DFD was one - were allocated a quota of seats in the national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"). East Germany's first general election took place in October 1950, almost exactly one year after the country had replaced the Soviet occupation zone. Following the election, which was organised according to the infamous \\"single-list\\" system, the DFD was allocated 20 of the 466 seats in the chamber. In May 1949 Elli Schmidt took over from Emmy Damerius-Koenen as national chair of the DFD after Damerius- Koenen had been required to relinquish the post, officially on health grounds. In 1950 Schmidt was appointed to head up the \\"Commission for drafting legislation on protection of mothers and children\\" (\\"Kommission zur Ausarbeitung des Gesetzes über den Mütter- und Kinderschutz\\"). In February 1953 she was appointed to chair the \\"National Commission for Commerce and Welfare\\" (\\"Staatliche Kommission für Handel und Versorgung\\"). Along with her national role in the DFD, Schmidt was a member of the executive and council of the Women's International Democratic Federation, an international anti-fascist umbrella organisation widely viewed as a proxy for Soviet expansionism (although the accusation has never gone entirely unchallenged), especially after it was obliged to remove its international head office from Paris and relocated to East Berlin. Elli Schmidt also served as a member of the People's Council (\\"Volksrat\\") and of the national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") which emerged from it between 1949 and 1954. Despite being an SED member she held one of the seats allocated to the DFD. At the Third SED Party Conference, held at the Werner Seelenbinder Sports Hall in East Berlin in July 1950, Elli Schmidt was elected a candidate for membership of the Politburo of the Central Committee. =The uprising and its aftermath= The uprising of 17 June 1953 involved more than one million people in about 700 localities. The street protests were suppressed very quickly, partly thanks to the unhestitating fraternal intervention on behalf of the forces of law and order by Soviet troops. These had been present in considerable numbers in East Germany since before the country's launch back in October 1949. The East German leadership, already unsettled by the (barely discernible on East German streets) winds of change emanating from Moscow since the death of Stalin in March 1953, suffered a crisis of confidence the extent of which has only gradually become apparent to outsiders. At least 21 people had been killed Many estimates set the number of fatalities at a far higher level. In July 1953 a dramatic politburo meeting took place, lasting through most of a long night. A number of comrades were still sufficiently shaken up by the June events to depart from their customary discretion, and openly to voice their criticisms of the Central Committee First Secretary. Although she was still only a candidate for membership, Elli Schmidt attended the meeting and was indeed one of the most forthright participants. Of the thirteen present, eleven called on Walter Ulbricht to resign. Only two spoke out in support of Ulbricht: Hermann Matern and Ulbricht's protégé, Erich Honecker. Comrade Elli Schmidt blamed herself for having \\"glossed over conditions [in the country] which it was a crime to have glossed over\\". \\"The whole spirit of out party is torn asunder\\". \\"The quick fixes, the lies, the running away from people's worries, the threats, the boastings - that has brought us to this point: for that, dear Walter, you bear more culpability than anyone, and that is what you will not admit, that without all that June 17 would never have happened\\". Records of politburo meetings were not published, and Elli Schmidt's remarkable outburst only became public in June 1990, thanks to the disclosure of eyewitness testimony provided in records kept by another politburo member, Friedrich Ebert Jr., who as the son of Germany's first (socialist) president always enjoyed a certain enduring untouchability within East Germany's ruling establishment. Even if details of that politburo meeting were at that time not widely known outside the politburo, it was no secret that Elli Schmidt was a supporter of the position taken Wilhelm Zaisser and Rudolf Herrnstadt, two senior Central Committee members known to be uneasy about the extent of the links between the SED and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. \\"We are not creating the Bolshevik Party\\", Herrnstadt had insisted (apparently to little effect) as far back as 1948, \\"but a very specific German party of the new type under certain historical conditions\\". In any imminent power struggle within the East German establishment it could therefore be assumed that the influence of the Communist Party in Moscow would be exerted in opposition to the Zaisser- Herrnstadt partnership. Ulbricht was Moscow's man and Ulbricht had long since mastered the applications of political power. Zaisser and Herrnstadt were removed from the Central Committee in July 1953 and then, six months later, excluded from the party in January 1954. Elli Schmidt, as a prominent supporter of them both, received a formal Central Committee reprimand and was removed from the Central Committee in January 1954. Elections to the politburo took place on 26 July 1953, but it turned out that Elli Schmidt's name no longer even appeared on the list of candidates for membership. She was removed from her leadership role in the DFD in September 1953. Interestingly, however, she was never expelled from the party and her fall from grace was less total (and less permanent) than that suffered by Zaisser and Herrnstadt. =After politics= Between 1954 and 1967 Elli Schmidt worked as director of the \\"Institut für Bekleidungskultur\\" (loosely, \\"Institute for Clothing Culture\\" - later renamed as the \\"German Fashion Institute\\"). The Central Committee rehabilitated her formally on 29 July 1956. After she retired in 1966 or 1967 she continued to live in East Berlin, which is where she died in 1980.

It was built in 1892. It is also known as Currently part of Duty Free Store complex. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  As indicated by James Meehan's Survey of 1807 this site was first occupied by Surgeon General John White at Lot No. 4 and Captain William Raven at Lot No. 5. In Mrs Underwood was the owner of three storey stone shops and houses each with seven rooms. By 1845 a two-storey brick house and shop with a shingle roof and five rooms was built. Also on this same allotment at the corner of George and Globe Streets a two-storey stone and brick house and store was erected. The five roomed house had \\"every convenience\\". In 1861 this building was used as a \\"Bowling Alley\\" managed by William Ogilvie. In 1871 in the tenements erected by Underwood, a public house was opened. The inn was called the \\"Nil Desperandum Hotel\\". By 1882 three two storey tenements were erected between the butcher shop and the brick and stone shop on the north side of the Public House, known as the New York Hotel. These shops and dwelling were constructed of brick and they were roofed in iron. In 1891 the building to the south corner of Globe and George Streets was pulled down. By 1891 George McEvoy had erected houses to the Harrington Street frontage. The four storey buildings were of brick and stone and the roofs were slated. In these houses were pulled down. In 1892 a three-storey brick and slate roofed shop and dwelling was erected for the Trustees of the Church of England to 145 George Street. In 1900 the area was resumed under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act. In the New York Hotel was demolished and by 1908 Tooth & Co. Ltd. erected the brick and iron roofed building to 153-155 George Street. In 1912 the tenements to 149 and 151 George Street were pulled down, and in the same year a two-storey brick office building was erected to the rear of 145 George Street. During 1913 Quay Chambers at 149-151 George Street were erected. The tenement to 147 George Street was demolished in 1914 and in that same year the present three storey brick building was erected. In the 1970s the ground floor shop was occupied by Downtown and Dyer, Grocers. In the 1980s the Duty Free Shop Group complex was constructed and the interior of the building gutted for the complex. The site was identified as having European occupation since at least 1791, with other structures by 1822. From then on, site development was intense. In the 1890s, and following the resumption in 1900 the current buildings facing George Street were constructed.  Description  The building is a three-storey face brick building on the corner of Globe Street, erected in 1892 as shops and offices. The building design can be described as an example of the transitional architecture of the late Victorian and early Federation periods. The upper parapet, rendered sills and keystones are typical of Victorian period detail, with the use of face brick more typical of the Federation period. As part of the development works of the 1980s a section of the building in Globe Street was demolished. At the time of the redevelopment the original awning and shopfront were reconstructed. In Globe Street a large services panel was inserted onto the rear of the ground floor and a new angled corner and false rear wall with blind windows facing the open gallery was created at that time. Style: Late Victorian and Early Federation; Storeys: 3; Facade: Brick. = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Destroyed? Assessment Basis: Modern development. Basement car parks. No archaeological work appears to have been undertaken for this site although the 1986 Assessment indicated a potential, and important, resource. The subsequent building operations appear to have obliterated much of this resource. Possible deposits survive beneath shops on George Street frontage. Investigation: Historical research and assessment of archaeology: destroyed. = Modifications and dates = *DFS complex: 1988 (the redevelopment involved the demolition of the rear of the George Street buildings, the removal of interior and the creation of new shopfront). *In 1914 to 157-159 George Street Nathan Jacobs erected the New York Theatre. The New York Theatre was demolished in 1937. *This site was acquired by the Public Transport Commission in 1946 and the City Circle Railway, which traverses the site, was opened in 1956. *In the late 1980s the site was developed with a large commercial historic building erected behind 145-155 George Street whilst the facades of the buildings were adapted.  Heritage listing  As at 18 November 2008, 145 George Street, The Rocks, was constructed in 1893 as part of a group of four buildings and has State heritage significance for its historic and social cultural values. 145 George Street has historic significance at State level for having been the site of early European settlement and has been continuously occupied by Europeans since 1788. The site has historic significance at local level for its associations with several phases of late 19th and 20th century urban renewal. Firstly, the commercial development of The Rocks in the last decade of the 19th century when the building was purpose-built as a grocery store; secondly, the demolition and rebuilding of much of The Rocks under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act following the 1900 plague outbreak; thirdly association with infrastructure works, including the construction of the City Railway link and the Cahill Expressway, which dramatically changed the visual curtilage of the group; and lastly, the 1980s creation of The Rocks as a tourist destination, when the interior and rear of the building was altered to accommodate the Duty Free Store Complex. 145 George Street has historic significance at local level for its associations with Downton & Dyer, a prominent local business that started as a grocery store in the late 19th century, developed as a wholesale business and is currently a major dry food supplier company that continues to operate in Sydney in larger premises under the same company name. The East Elevation of 145 George Street has high aesthetic significance at local level associated with being a representative example of a Victorian Regency style commercial building designed in the last decade of the 19th century. In the 1980s the West Elevation, much of the ground floor and upper floor interiors were altered. While this has reduced the ability to interpret the building's significance, the eastern façade contributes to the aesthetic and historic diversity of the George Street streetscape. A street awning, in keeping with the original design, was reinstated. Shopfronts while not identical to the original, were sympathetic in design and character to turn of the century shopfronts. 145 George Street forms part of a group of four commercial buildings (Nos. 145, 147, 149-151 and 153-155 George Street) which front the eastern portion of the DFS (Duty Free Store) complex. This group of buildings, bounded by Globe Street and the Cahill Expressway, mark George St's southern entry to The Rocks precinct. The facades of the four late 19th century and early 20th century buildings have streetscape qualities and character that contribute to the overall richness of a coherent and harmonious brick and stucco group of buildings located within The Rocks. Within its location in The Rocks, which has State heritage significance, the subject site and the building group as a whole, contributes to a precinct unique to NSW with its historic associations and streetscape character. The group is an important part of The Rocks Heritage Conservation Area being sympathetic in scale and character and an extension of the remaining earlier buildings of George St, presenting a unified streetscape. The buildings are tangible evidence of the redevelopment of The Rocks in the last decade of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century. 145 George Street has high social significance as a contributory element associated with the historic character of The Rocks, which is held in esteem by the local community and the people of NSW. Shop and Residence was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. 145 George Street is a three-storey face brick building on the corner of Globe Street. The building was erected between 1892 and 1893 as shops and offices. 145 George Street has associations as a built element within George Street and Globe Street. George Street is the oldest street in Australia and Globe Street is one of the earliest cross streets. 145 George Street has high significance at local level associated with a corner shop operating continuously on the site and managed by the same proprietor, for almost ninety years. The business changed in over 80 years from a single-owner grocery store to a wholesale providores. The company moved from The Rocks to accommodate an expanding business. 145 George Street has moderate significance at local level for its associations with the phase of redevelopment of The Rocks in the 1980s when the precinct was transformed into a major tourist attraction. The item meets this criterion at State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. 145 George Street has moderate historic significance at local level for its association with the grocery company, Downton & Dyer Ltd, who operated from The Rocks from 1879 before Jesse Dyer moved to the premises at the corner of Globe and George Streets in 1893. The company amalgamated to become Downton & Dyer in 1918. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The four brick buildings (Nos. 145; 147, 149-151 and 153-155 George Street) of heritage significance, which as a group, provide evidence of two phases of commercial activity in The Rocks just before and just after the plague outbreak and subsequent resumption of land at the turn of the century. Although compromised by the loss of rear sections, ground floor interiors and street awnings in the 1980s, it remains a coherent and harmonious brick and stucco group. The buildings are the representative of the commercial architecture of the Federation period and the transitional phase prior to the turn of the century. They are tangible evidence of the redevelopment of The Rocks in the early 20th century and also the more recent redevelopment period associated with the SCA. These buildings also provide evidence of historical association with prominent local business such as W. A. Grubb butchers. The Central Sydney Heritage Inventory contains separate listings for the building facades of 145-151George St. and the former New York Hotel at 153-155 George Street: \\"Of environmental significance for its contribution to an architecturally diverse and historically important commercial streetscape of heritage significance as physical evidence of the growth and consolidation associated with the maritime activities at Circular Quay\\". The group of four buildings was classified as part of the George Street Business Precinct by the National Trust of Australia in the mid 1970s: \\"A group of four compatible Edwardian buildings containing interesting and lively fenestration which combine to present a picturesque street elevation. The group acts as a sympathetic extension to the remaining earlier buildings of George Street in scale and character to present a unified streetscape\\". The above listings indicate that the primary significance of the group is their contribution to the historic streetscape as well as their aesthetic value as a group of Federation period commercial buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Rocks in general has considerable significance to the general community of Sydney and the people of NSW as a heritage precinct. The Rocks of which the subject site forms a part, is important to the community's sense of place and is subsequently held in esteem. Shopping is a major activity within The Rocks area. As the first commercial district of Sydney relating directly to the ports and shipping, the area has developed a strong commercial focus, which is currently maintained by tourism. The subject site has maintained its historic association with shopping and retail. The item meets this criterion at State level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The earliest and most substantial phase of building on the subject site and in close proximity occurred by 1822. These earliest buildings, located along the George Street frontage, comprised the Underwood Buildings, an adjacent shop to the north and Thomas Moore's house. Archaeological evidence from a series of cottages erected on the southern section of the site during the 1820-30s has probably been removed by later 19th and 20th century developments. Due to considerable disturbance related to construction works, the subject site has little scientific/ research significance and does not meet this criterion. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There are numerous examples of Victorian/Federation style corner shop buildings within The Rocks that are similar to 145 George Street. The item does not meet this assessment criterion. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The shops and shopping district of The Rocks are representative of the continuing commercial use of the area and the change to tourism. 145 George Street is one of the group of shop buildings that operated in The Rocks from the end of the 19th century until the late 20th century. 145 George Street is representative of this group and meets the criterion at local level.

Although it never saw action in its coastal defence role, it formed several siege batteries of heavy howitzers for service on the Western Front and Italian Front in World War I. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 1–3.Spiers, pp. 163–8. A number of Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) were formed for coastal defence in South Wales, and by the 1880s they had been consolidated as the 1st Glamorganshire Artillery Volunteer Corps of 17 batteries. In 1890 the unit's headquarters (HQ) moved from Cardiff to Swansea, and the batteries grouped round Cardiff were separated to form a new 2nd Glamorganshire AVC. After reorganisation these became 11 batteries (companies from 1891) distributed as follows:Litchfield & Westlake, p. 81.1st Glamorgan Artillery Volunteers at Regiments.org.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 5.Army List, various dates. * Cardiff (5) * Penarth (2) * Bridgend (1) * Barry (3) Sir Edward Hill, VD, MP, who had been Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the 1st Glamorganshire since 22 July 1864, retained the position with both units after 1 June 1890, though each had its own lieutenant-colonel and Honorary Colonel. The new unit formed part of the Western Division of the Royal Artillery (RA). In 1902 the RA's divisional structure was abolished, and artillery volunteers became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). The Cardiff unit was designated the 2nd Glamorganshire RGA (Volunteers).Litchfield & Westlake, p. 6. Territorial Force When the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st Glamorganshire transferred to the Royal Field Artillery and the 2nd Glamorganshire became the Glamorgan and Pembroke RGA.Litchfield, p. 81.London Gazette, 20 March 1908. The 'Pembroke' part of the title was dropped in 1910 when a separate Pembroke RGA of three companies was formed.London Gazette, 14 October 1910.Litchfield, p. 204. The Glamorgan RGA was designated as a Defended Ports unit in Western Coast Defences, which was based at Pembroke Dock, and it had the following organisation:Conrad 1914. * HQ at Cardiff * Nos 1–3 Companies at Cardiff * No 4 Company at Penarth * No 5 Company at Barry World War I=Mobilisation= The Glamorgan RGA mobilised in August 1914 as part of No 26 Coastal Fire Command, responsible for the defence of Swansea, Cardiff and Barry.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 402, 409. On the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and on 15 August 1914, the War Office (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate brigades, companies and batteries were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. By October 1914, the campaign on the Western Front was bogging down into Trench warfare and there was an urgent need for batteries of siege artillery to be sent to France. The WO decided that the TF coastal gunners were well enough trained to take over many of the duties in the coastal defences, releasing Regular RGA gunners for service in the field, and 1st line RGA companies that had volunteered for overseas service had been authorised to increase their strength by 50 per cent.WO Instruction No 248 of October 1914. Although complete defended ports units never went overseas, they did supply trained gunners to RGA units serving overseas. They also provided cadres to form new units for front line service, and the Glamorgan RGA is known to have raised at least four siege batteries in this way: 96th, 121st, 172nd and 359th. Under Army Council Instruction 686 of April 1917, the coastal defence companies of the RGA (TF) were reorganised. By this stage of the war, the Glamorgan RGA serving in the Swansea and Severn Defences of Western Command consisted of just three companies, the rest having formed batteries for overseas service. These companies were given a slightly higher establishment (five officers and 100 other ranks) and renumbered, abolishing the 1st and 2nd Line distinction:Army Council Instructions April 1917. * 1/2 Company became No 1 Company * 1/3 Company became No 2 Company * 2/2 Company became No 3 Company In April 1918 the Cardiff/Barry Garrison manned guns as follows:Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, Annex 4. * Nells Point, Barry Battery – 2 x 6-inch Mk VII guns * Penarth Head, Cardiff Battery – 2 x 6-inch Mk VII guns The Swansea Garrison manned: * Mumbles Island Battery – 2 x 4.7-inch QF guns 9.2-inch howitzer in action on the Somme, 1916. =96th Siege Battery, RGA= According to WO Instruction No 181 of December 1915, 96th Siege Battery was to be formed at Pembroke Dock by three officers and 78 other ranks (the establishment of a full company) drawn from the Glamorgan RGA.WO Instructions December 1915. The battery actually formed on 1 January 1916 with three officers and 90 men from the Glamorgan RGA and 64 recruits from the Pembroke Dock RGA establishment, under the command of Major C.H.M. Sturgis.MacDonald, Pro Patria Mori, p. 172.

As the final bombardment began on Z Day (1 July), the battery fired with such intensity that the oil in the guns' hydraulic recoil buffers boiled.MacDonald, Pro Patria Mori, p. 258. However, the Gommecourt attack was a disaster.MacDonald, Pro Patria Mori, pp. 358–422, 456–7.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 467–71. Later the battery served at Arras and the latter stages of the Battle of Passchendaele, where the British artillery suffered badly from counter-battery fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire.'Allocation of HA Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1.

It went out to the Western Front in July 1916, manning four 9.2-inch howitzers, and joined I ANZAC Corps in Fifth Army on 15 July in time for the Battle of Pozières. It was later engaged at Arras and Passchendaele.Army Council Instructions March 1916. 121st Siege Bty was joined by a section from 428th Siege Bty and expanded to six 9.2-inch howitzers by the end of 1917. The battery was caught up in the 'Great Retreat' of March 1918, but returned during the Hundred Days campaign, including supporting the assault crossing of the St Quentin Canal on 29 September and participating in the crushing artillery barrages of the victorious Hundred Days offensive.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 307–9; 318–20. 121st Siege Battery was disbanded in 1919. Crew positioning a 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer in 1918. =172nd Siege Battery, RGA= 172nd Siege Battery, RGA, was raised at Cardiff with three officers and 78 other ranks from the Glamorgan RGA under Army Council Instruction 1239 of 21 June 1916. It went out to the Western Front on 12 September 1916 equipped with four 6-inch 26 cwt Howitzers. It was engaged in the preparation for the Arras Offensive and at Passchendaele. 172nd Siege Bty was joined by a section from 415th Siege Bty on 26 August 1917, and brought up to a strength of six 6-inch howitzers. In November 1917 the battery was part of the reinforcements sent to the Italian Front after the disastrous Battle of Caporetto. It went into action supporting the Italian army holding the line of the River Piave and in June 1918 supported the defences during the Second Battle of the Piave River.Falls, pp. 89–92, 131–2, 143, 157–67.Campbell, pp. 96–100.Shepard, in Campbell, p. 125.Thompson, pp. 328–30, 344–7.Kurt Peball, 'The Piave: Austria's last Throw', Purnell's History of the First World War, Vol 7, No 6, pp. 2833–8.Philip Warner, 'The Piave: Italian Counterattack', Purnell's History of the First World War, Vol 7, No 6, pp. 2839–47. The British guns participated in the final battle on the Italian Front, the stunning success of the Battle of Vittorio Veneto on 23 October. By 1 November the Austrian army had collapsed and the pursuing British troops had left their heavy guns far in the rear.Campbell, pp. 101–4.Falls, pp. 169-77.Thompson, pp. 356–64.Franco Velsecchi, 'Vittorio Veneto', Purnell's History of the First World War, Vol 7, No 14, pp. 3064–71. 172nd Battery was disbanded by the end of March 1919.Campbell, pp. 106–19. Loading a 12-inch railway howitzer on the Western Front. =359th Siege Battery, RGA= 359th Siege Battery trained as a BL 12-inch railway howitzer battery and went out to the Western Front on 10 June 1917 and joined 19th HAG with XV Corps on the Flanders coast. 10th HAG transferred to Fourth Army HQ on 1 August. The battery joined 76th HAG with Second Army in the Ypres Salient on 21 September, while Second Army was fighting the last stages of the Battle of Passchendaele. On 14 November the battery transferred to 80th HAG, but that headquarters was sent to the Italian Front, so the battery came under the command of other HAGs until January 1918, when it became 'Army Troops' and was no longer attached to a HAG. Railway construction lagged during the rapid advances of the Hundred Days Offensive and the battery was left behind in the Salient. It was still serving with Second Army when the Armistice came into force in November 1918. 359th Siege Battery was disbanded in 1919. Interwar After the TF was demobilised in 1919 the Glamorgan RGA was placed in suspended animation. It was reformed in 1920, and when the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, the unit was designated as the Glamorgan Coast Brigade, RGA. It consisted of HQ and 181 Heavy Battery at the Drill Hall, Cardiff, in 53rd (Welsh) Divisional Area.Titles & Designations. It was responsible for manning the two 6-inch guns at Lavernock Battery near Cardiff, and the two 4.7-inch guns at Mumbles Battery, near Swansea.Maurice-Jones, p. 221. In 1924 the RGA was subsumed into the RA, and in 1938 the coast brigades were redesignated as heavy regiments, hence the unit at Cardiff became the Glamorgan Heavy Regiment, RA. A 1927 report on coastal defences by the Committee of Imperial Defence made recommendations for the defence of 15 home ports, and another eight schemes were added in 1929, including Swansea, Barry, Cardiff and Newport, but little was done to modernise them.Collier, Chapter III. World War II=Mobilisation= The regiment mobilised in Western Command on the outbreak of war in September 1939 with the single 181 Battery under command.Western Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. Cardiff and Barry were designated Class A defended ports, with guns installed in peacetime, though the defence schemes of both were still being prepared. On 12 April 1940 plans were made for 6-inch guns to be installed at Swansea.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex B. When the Battle of France turned against the Allies in May 1940, the Admiralty made a number of 6-inch guns available to the army for coastal defence, and when the whole of the UK was put on invasion alert after the Dunkirk evacuation a massive programme of coastal defences was initiated. Although this mainly involved the likely invasion areas of South and South-East England, an emergency battery of two BL 6-inch Mk XII naval guns was authorised on 12 June for Penarth, and two more of two BL 4-inch Mk VII naval guns each were authorised for Llanelli and Port Talbot on 21 July and completed by 24 August. These guns were moved around as required: as of November 1940, Cardiff and Barry had four 6-inch guns, Swansea had two 6-inch and two 4.7-inch, and Llanelli had one 4-inch. Although designated a major port, Newport still had no guns.Collier, Appendix XIX. In September 1940 the coastal artillery was reorganised, and the regiment became 531st (Glamorgan) Coast Regiment.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.531 Coast Rgt at RA 1939–45. In addition, 21st Coast Artillery Group (later 559th Special Coast Regiment) was formed in October at Mumbles, near Swansea.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex H.559 Coast Rgt at RA 1939–45.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 20: Coast Artillery, 1 June 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/117. Britain's coastal defences reached their height in September 1941, by which time Cardiff, Swansea and Barry (all defined as major ports) each had two 6-inch guns, and Barry had two 4.7-inch in addition. Newport still only had two 12-pounders, as did Llanelli. Port Talbot had a defence battery of two 4-inch guns. At this stage of the war, the coast defences in Glamorgan were as follows: * 531st (Glamorgan) Coast Regiment BL 6-inch Mk VII naval gun in typical coast defence mounting (this example is preserved at Newhaven Fort). ** HQ at Cardiff ** 130 Bty – joined by June 1941 ** 145 Independent Bty – joined by August 1941Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 20: Coast Artillery, 16 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/118. ** 181 Bty – left by June 1941 ** 188, 189 Btys – formed 15 May 1941; joined before December 1941 ** 192, 365, 366 Btys – joined by June 1941 ** 427 Bty – joined by August 1941 * 559th Special Coast Regiment – formed June 1941 ** HQ at Mumbles ** 146, 298, 401, 401 Btys ** 32 and 33 Coast Observer Detachments – joined by December 1941 =Mid-War= At the end of 1941 the defences of the Severn Estuary were completely reorganised: on 19 December 531st Rgt lost five of its batteries to two new coast regiments, 570th and 571st, formed from Flat Holm and Brean Down Fire Control respectively. They were replaced two newly-formed batteries, 430 and 431 joining 531st and 559th Rgts.

A process of reducing the manpower in the coast defences began.Collier, Chapter XIX. 531st (Glamorgan) Coast Rgt was stood down in December 1942 and its batteries assigned to 570th Coast Rgt, which together with other reassignments gave Severn Defences the following organisation in 1943:Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 7: Coast Artillery, Defence Troops, Royal Artillery, and AA Defence of Merchant Ships (July 1943), with amendments, TNA file WO 212/124. * 559th Coast Rgt ** 299, 422, 431 Btys ** 24 Coast Observer Detachment – joined by July 1943 ** 33 Coast Observer Detachment * 570th Coast Rgt ** 145, 146, 170, 187, 205, 430 ** 1, 2 Coast Observer Detachments – disbanded by May 1943 ** 105 Coast Observer Detachment – joined by December 1942 ** 106 Coast Observer Detachment – joined by December 1942, to 532nd Coast Rgt by July 1943, returned by November 1943 * 571st Coast Rgt ** 184, 188, 189, 366 ** 78 Coast Observer Detachment – joined by November 1943 =Disbandment= The manpower requirements for the forthcoming Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) led to further reductions in coast defences in April 1944: 559th and 571st Coast Rgts were disbanded and 570th had all their batteries assigned to it, 24 and 33 Coast Observer Detachments replacing 105 and 106, though they also left in July. By this stage of the war many of the coast battery positions were manned by Home Guard detachments or in the hands of care and maintenance parties.

Postwar When the TA was reformed in 1947, 531st (Glamorgan) Coast Regiment was formally disbanded, and the 664th (Welsh) Coast Regiment was formed as a new unit at Cardiff, though it is unclear why it was not considered as a successor to 531st Coast Rgt. In 1950 the 'Welsh' subtitle was changed to 'Glamorgan'. In 1953 the regiment was amalgamated with 425th (Pembroke) Coast Rgt to form 408th Coast Rgt based at the Defensible Barracks, Pembroke Dock, with R and S Btys provided by the 664th.Litchfield, p. 83,638–677 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.414–443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.372–413 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.

On 1 January 1978, Maria Santissima di Pietraquaria (\\"Most Holy Mary of Pietraquaria\\") was proclaimed the patroness saint of the city of Avezzano. The Virgin Mary is celebrated with events and religious rites between 25 and 27 April.. Pope Gregory XVI granted a canonical coronation towards the venerated image on 16 September 1838.  History  Madonna di Pietraquaria protecting the city of Avezzano (serigraphy by Fedele De Bernardinis, 1791) = Cult origins = The chapel erected in the place where the miraculous encounter between the Madonna and the deaf-mute shepherd Focaraccio in honour of the Madonna di Pietraquaria The cult is related to the presence of the medieval town of Pietra Aquaria (literally \\"water stone\\") on the top of Mount Salviano since the 10th century. Here, as attested by Pope Clement III's 12th century bull, there were three small religious buildings: Saint Peter, Saint John and Saint Mary. In this church a painting depicting the Virgin with Child was located. Statue of the Madonna and plaque commemorating the coronation In Middle Ages Pietraquaria was an important independent fief of the Countship of Albe, as it can be desumed from the Catalogue of the Barons of 1187 and by the same 12th century Papal bull.. In 1268 the fortified town suffered the devastation at the hands of Charles I of Anjou's army who, following the victory of the Battle of Tagliacozzo, wanted to take revenge on the hamlets whose inhabitants sided with Conradin of Hohenstaufen's Ghibellines. Thus the inhabitants scattered in Mount Salviano hamlets were forced to go down and gather at Pantano, in the square later dedicated to Saint Bartholomew near contemporary Avezzano, together with the peoples from other villages and Albe, which was also plundered by the Angevins. Religious tradition reports that the Madonna's image remained for centuries within the ruined church of Mount Salviano, and was recovered following a miraculous encounter on Mount Salviano between a young deaf-mute shepherd and the Virgin, which caused the reconstruction of the church. According to the work Historiae Marsorum by Muzio Febonio, in 1614 there was the complete reconstruction of the religious building, which was enlarged compared to the original church,. as it was recorded in the subsequent affidavit for the Madonna's coronation by notary Pietro Orlandi.Documents and depositions attested in the affidavit drawn up by notary Pietro Orlandi on 27 June 1838. = Marian apparition = Oral tradition has brought a story to the present day, about a deaf-mute shepherd boy from Avezzano to whom, while pasturing the flock on Mount Salviano and gazing at the waters of Fucino, the Madonna appeared dressed in white on a mule. She addressed him in tender words, which the deaf-mute miraculously managed to hear, and asked him to have her church rebuilt by Avezzanese people. The shepherd boy came down running from Mount Salviano, and as soon as he reached Avezzano went to the parish priest, whom he told what the Holy Virgin had recommended, that is, to restore the Church of Saint Mary and worthily replace the sacred image onto the altar. The Chapel of the Apparition situated along the Via Crucis on Mount Salviano preserves the print that the Madonna's mule carved in the stone with a blow of his hoof before disappearing with the Virgin. The reconstruction of the church occurred in 1614 and the cult of the Virgin of Pietraquaria grew among all the inhabitants of Avezzano.. = Miracles = Copy of a page from the affidavit drawn up in 1838 The Madonna di Pietraquaria is traditionally credited with numerous miracles, owing to which the image was solemnly crowned by the Vatican Chapter in 1838: * The liberation from drought on 27 April 1779 after a penitence procession, therefore the Madonna's annual feast was established on that day (previously the Madonna di Pietraquaria was celebrated on the fourth Sunday of May). In that year the population of Avezzano had serious difficulties because of a long drought which caused several problems and a shortage of food. The inhabitants of the town incessantly prayed the Madonna, whom on 27 April they took in procession from the sanctuary dedicated to her on Mount Salviano to the town centre.. When the procession entered Naples Street a miraculous storm occurred that broke dryness, allowing the population to look after crops again with the necessary vigour.. In the same year, thanks to the offerings and donations from Avezzano citizens the sacred building was enlarged and the veneration grew with it.. * The liberation from the French invasion in the early 19th century. * The liberation from the sack of Avezzano by the same French to eliminate the brigands who had occupied it in the early 19th century. * The cessation of flood waters in 1836. * The liberation from cholera in 1837. * On 27 April 1944, Anglo-American Flying Fortresses took off to raze to the ground Avezzano, then an important railway junction. That day, a thick fog covered the city and therefore the Allied forces headed towards another place.. Besides, at the Sanctuary of Pietraquaria, visitors can admire about one hundred ex votos, exposed in the Confraternity's dedicated rooms and donated by those who in the past believed that they had received blessings from the Virgin Mary of Pietraquaria. = Icon = Icon of the Madonna di Pietraquaria (author unknown, 13th–14th century) The small Church of Saint Mary in the medieval nucleus of Pietra Aquaria contained the painting depicting the image of the Holy Virgin. The historical events of the Battle of Tagliacozzo, which occurred in the Palentine Plains between Charles I of Anjou and Conradin of Hohenstaufen, led to the destruction of the village of Pietra Aquaria and obliged inhabitants to gather at Pantano, in the plain where contemporary Avezzano lies. After the destruction operated by the Angevins the image of the Virgin remained miraculously intact between the ruined walls of the church. The painting on wood, originally in a Byzantine style and the work by an unknown author, was modified in the early Risorgimento period. The Madonna is depicted standing, dressed in red with a blue coloured, star- studded mantle; she supports the Jesus Child with her right arm while keeping his feet with the palm of her left hand. The Child appears naked while blessing with the three fingers of his right hand and gently keeping a hem of his mother's mantle. Following the coronation occurring in 1838, two golden diadems were placed upon the statue. = Coronation of the icon = On 16 September 1838 the solemn coronation consented to by the Vatican Chapter in Saint Peter's occurred. In 1891, after further enlargements of the sacred building, the Confraternita di Maria Santissima di Pietraquaria (\\"Confraternity of Most Holy Mary of Pietraquaria\\") was established, officially recognized by the Diocese of Marsi.. On a pedestal, placed on the Mount Salviano pass, a small bronze statue depicting the Madonna stands; a plaque commemorating the coronation was posted by the Avezzano Pro Loco (local promotion association) in 2013 in accordance with the local Confraternity.  Confraternity  The Confraternity of Most Holy Mary of Pietraquaria was established by the Bishop of Marsi Monsignor Enrico De Dominicis with an episcopal bull on 8 June 1891. The Confraternity of Pietraquaria began its activity on 27 September 1891 devoting wide spaces to evangelization, education, activities of assistance and charity in order to follow the teachings dictated by the Vatican Council II.  Feast of the Madonna di Pietraquaria  Focaraccio in the Madonna del Passo district of Avezzano Procession of the Madonna di Pietraquaria Every year the patronal festival lasts for three days from 25 to 27 April. On 25 April the traditional Pietraquaria Fair takes place, which is organized by the Assessorship of Productive Activities of the Avezzano municipality. There are hundreds of exhibitors and nonprofit organization along the streets of the town center. During the fair CIDEC (Italian Confederation of Dealers and Shopkeepers) organizes the local antiques street market in the central Risorgimento Square. Since 1870, on 26 April at dusk the so-called focaracciFocaracci is a word from the Avezzanese dialect, approximately meaning \\"big fires\\". The singular form is focaraccio. are kindled in all the town districts. They are devotional bonfires in honour of the Madonna di Pietraquaria, similar to the Beltane bonfires. Around them popular and religious songs and small music concerts are performed. According to a legend the tradion of focaracci arose from a dispute between the populations of Avezzano and Cese about whom merited the Virgin's protection. From the top of Mount Salviano the Madonna turned towards the city of Avezzano to look at the bonfires that were lit by Avezzanese people in order to draw her attention. Prior to the 1915 earthquake, on the day of the celebrations in honour of the Madonna the Contest of the Solco Dritto (\\"Straight Furrow\\") took place, where local farmers challenged each other with the plough and oxen to trace a furrow from Torlonia Square to the slopes of Mount Salviano. A commission was called to determine the best furrow. During the 1992 civil celebrations the Corsa dei Fuochi (\\"Race of Fires\\") was organized: it was a foot race competition, which saw the participation of several teams representing the Avezzano districts, competing for the city banner, and of several Marsica teams, competing for the Fucino banner. Religious rites are held on 27 April, officially recognized as the patronal holy day of Avezzano. Every year the statue of the Virgin is taken in procession going down the Via Crucis of Mount Salviano, and then reaching the Cathedral of St. Bartholomew along two urban routes which alternate from year to year, according to the confraternity organizing the rite.. In the Marian month of May the custom remains of going to the Sanctuary of the Madonna di Pietraquaria on foot at dawn, through the Mount Saviano trails. In 2017 the Madonna di Pietraquaria has been proclaimed the patroness of Marsica runners and racewalkers.

According to Trouser Presss David Sprague, Love Child was \\"...one of Gotham's most mercurial bands, able to leap from twee pop tunes to galvanizing skronkadelic constructs in a single bound.\\" History Love Child was formed in 1987 by Will Baum, the band's drummer, guitarist, and vocalist, and Rebecca Odes, the band's bassist and vocalist. Alan Licht later joined the band as another guitarist, drummer, and vocalist. When the band was formed, Licht, Odes, and Baum were all students in the class of 1990 at Vassar College. In February 1990, Love Child recorded their debut studio album, Okay?. Later that year, the zine Forced Exposure released Love Child's EP Love Child Plays Moondog. This EP, to which Baum did not contribute, featured four of the band's covers of Moondog songs. Baum left Love Child between the recording of Okay? in 1990 and its release the following year. His role as drummer was subsequently filled by Brendan O'Malley. Okay? was released on Homestead Records in late 1991. The band released its second and final studio album, Witchcraft, in 1992; they broke up soon afterward. Critical reception Robert Christgau awarded Okay? a B+ grade, writing, \\"Too bad these punk-going-no-wave neotraditionalists didn't study their Ramones harder--instead of crowding 21 songs into 45 minutes, they might have grouped the 14 snappiest into a dandy 27-minute shot in the dark.\\" AllMusic's Dan Warburton gave the album three out of five stars, writing, \\"Licht reveals throughout the album not only an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of the electric guitar, with echoes of Pete Townshend, Robert Quine, Bob Mould, and Rudolph Grey (his solo on \\"Slow Me Down\\" is outstanding), but also a genuine talent for songwriting.\\" Nils Bernstein gave Witchcraft a favorable review in Spin, praising Rebecca Odes as having \\"one of those casually classic voices such as Kim Deal's, immediately familiar and utterly inimitable.\\" Jason Cherkis of the Daily Collegian also reviewed the album favorably, writing, \\"On Witchcraft, the group doesn't twist but glides, forming perfect underground nursery rhymes without putting you to sleep.\\" Jason Ankeny of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, describing it as \\"Another wonderful record from one of the most criminally overlooked bands of the early '90s.\\" Discography=LPs= *Okay?

In 1864 he was apprenticed to a shoemaker. Sent by his master to deliver a pair of shoes at the house of a priest, the boy was seized and dragged to the Casa dei Neofiti, where he was detained for baptism. The papal authorities refused to surrender him, in spite of the protests of his father and of the Jewish community. The affair caused a stir throughout Europe, particularly in France, the French ambassador, Count Sartigues, protesting vehemently in the name of his government. To his remonstrance the papal government replied that the child had himself determined to turn Christian, and that it was not the function of the pope to interfere with such a resolution. The pope, in examining into the case, is said to have asked Coen whether he embraced Christianity of his own free will. The boy replied that he preferred a religion which provided him with fine clothes, good food, and plenty of toys, to his poor family and the shoemaker's shop. This reply convinced the pope of the sincerity of the convert's intentions; and accordingly, on St. Michael's Day, Sept. 29, 1864, the baptism of Coen was celebrated in St. Stanislaus Chapel, Cardinal Caggiano officiating, and Count De Maistre being godfather. The neophyte received the name of Stanislaus Maria Michael Joseph Pius Eugenio. The sufferings of Coen's family, caused by his capture, were excessive. His eighteen-year-old sister died as a result of the excitement; his mother became insane and was taken to relatives in Leghorn; and his father had to leave Rome in order to escape the persecution of the government. Another Jew was thrown into prison because he said he had seen Coen at the window of the Casa. Moreover, as a result of the affair, a Christian mechanic caused the forcible baptism of an eight-year-old Jewish boy. It was only on the fall of the papal government in 1870, and after energetic measures had been taken by the Italian government, that Coen was released and restored to his mother in Leghorn, his forcible detention having extended over seven years. His life after that is unknown.

History The monastery is located on the medieval citadel of the town of Elassona, and was founded between 1295 and 1304, probably by the co-rulers of Thessaly, the sebastokratores Constantine and Theodore. Only the main church (katholikon) survives from the original monastery complex. It comprises a domed main space with an ambulatory on three sides. Its masonry is brick-enclosed, and features use of ancient spolia. Various annexes were added at times to the katholikon, but none of them survives today, apart from a small chapel in the southern side, built in 1819 and dedicated to Saint Nektarios. The 14th-century frescoes that decorate its interior make it \\"one of the finest examples of Palaiologan-era architecture and painting\\". Among the frescoes is a portrait of the Byzantine emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (). The wooden templon dates to 1840, was constructed by the master carver Demetrios of Metsovo. In a 1342 sigillion of Patriarch John XIV Kalekas, the stauropegic status of the monastery is confirmed. A forged chrysobull attributed to Andronikos III Palaiologos concerning the possessions of the monastery contains extensive estates and subsidiary establishments (metochia) as far as Larissa. The monastery amassed great wealth, and was the major spiritual centre of the region, particularly during the 16th and 18th centuries. Today Dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos, until the 18th century it is recorded also as dedicated to the Transfiguration of the Saviour. The surname Olympiotissa derives from a famed icon of the Panagia, which is believed to have come from a no longer extant monastery at Karya, on the foot of Mount Olympus. Once a year, on 5 October, the icon is borne in a litany from the monastery to the Church of Saint Demetrios. Originally male, today it is a female monastery, and celebrates on 6 and 15 August. The monastery also features a guest house, library, and a natural history museum.

The organization serves older adults of all religions and ethnicities at its three campuses in Manhattan, The Bronx, and Mamaroneck in Westchester County. It provides rehabilitative services, skilled nursing, senior housing, and numerous home health programs, including a certified home health agency and a home care agency. The organization was founded in 1848 by Hannah Leo of the B'nai Jeshurun Ladies' Benevolent Society. History=1848–1878: Foundation and the establishment of first home= Hannah Leo and other women of the B'nai Jeshurun congregation founded the B'nai Jeshurun Ladies' Benevolent Society for the Relief of Indigent Females on November 21, 1848. In its early years, the society struggled to accumulate funds for its philanthropic endeavors. Through various fundraising efforts, the society had accrued around $5,000 by the late 1860s. The organization was officially incorporated on March 13, 1866. On May 24, 1870, it opened a home for elderly women in a ten-room house it had rented at 215 West 17th Street in Manhattan. The home, also referred to as the Home for Aged and Infirm Hebrews, initially housed four to seven women. It was one of the first nursing homes or eldercare facilities of its kind. Founder Hannah Leo passed soon after the home opened, but her son, Simeon N. Leo, served as attending physician for many years. In 1872, the organization was re-incorporated as the Home for Aged and Infirm Hebrews. In March 1872, the home was moved to a building on West 32nd Street and served 14 women at that time. Accommodations proved inadequate there, and, in May 1873, the home was moved to a 5-story building on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street that was capable of housing 50 individuals. At the time, the home housed 28 women and 6 men, all of whom were elderly or ill. In 1875 or 1876, the institution acquired a mansion at Avenue A and 86th Street that had previously been used as an eldercare facility. =1879–1922: Moving to main campus and subsequent growth= In 1879, administrators began coordinating with the B'nai B'rith service organization about the prospect of finding a plot of land to build a new facility. The two organizations agreed to a partnership to build a new home in January 1880. Later that year, 8 adjoining lots on 105th and 106th Streets in Manhattan were purchased. The cornerstone on the new building was laid in May 1882, and it was completed in 1883 at a cost of $200,000, much of which was paid via donations. Nine more adjoining lots were later purchased. The construction of an annex on that land was completed in November 1889. The apartments in the annex were reserved for the most ill residents. Another adjoining property was purchased in 1894, and construction of a new wing began in 1895. At that time, the home had 163 residents. The new wing and a general expansion of the facility were completed in 1896, increasing the capacity to 300 residents. In 1902, the association had paid off all debts, and around 220 people were living at the facility. A 4-story extension to the campus was approved in 1907. Since its founding in 1917, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York (now, the UJA- Federation of New York), has continually supported the work of the home. A few years later in 1920, the home celebrated its 50th anniversary. At the time, Dr. Simeon N. Leo was still the attending physician and surgeon, and the facility housed 350 residents. In 1921 Dr. Frederic D. Zeman, a Mount Sinai physician, developed the first patient-centered model of care at Jewish Home, where he also served as Medical Director for 45 years. In January 1922, a 4-story addition that could house up to 75 new individuals was completed. =1922–1987: Hospital accreditation and continued expansion= After Dr. Simeon N. Leo's death in the 1920s, the facility added full-time medical staff. In the 1940s, the organization received accreditation as a hospital from the Joint Commission and was one of the only geriatric hospitals of its kind in the United States. To address the shortage of institutional care for the aged, in 1948 Jewish Home became the country's first organization to provide home care for older adults helping them remain in their own homes for as long as possible. In June 1950, the Kingsbridge House annex located at Kingsbridge Road and University Avenue in the Bronx was completed at a site that was once the Hebrew Infant Asylum. The six-building facility was capable of housing around 100 individuals (all of whom could receive care from their own private doctors) and cost roughly $3 million to build. That amount was largely paid by the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York (now, the UJA-Federation of New York). Upon the completion of the annex, the home became the \\"largest nonprofit voluntary agency serving the needs of older persons in the U.S.\\" Around 1964, the home changed its name to the Jewish Home and Hospital for Aged. A new facility—called the Friedman Building after former trustees Sol and Amelia G. Friedman—was completed on West 106th Street in November 1967. The 8-story building featured an auditorium, physical medicine and recreational therapy departments, club rooms, a synagogue, and conference and teaching rooms, among others. In 1970, a modern senior housing facility called \\"Kittay House\\" (now, Kittay Senior Apartments) was opened on Webb Avenue in the Bronx. These apartments, which are Mitchell-Lama independent living residences, did not have 24-hour nursing care, but emergency medical help was available as needed. In September 1972, a new addition to the Jewish Home was completed. The Greenwall Pavilion—named after philanthropist Frank Greenwall—was capable of housing 320 additional residents and cost $12 million to complete. By 1979, the Jewish Home was caring for over 1,800 elderly people. In 1983, under the direction of Leslie S. Libow (professor of geriatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the medical director at the Jewish Home), the country's first geriatric fellowship program was established. The program with Mount Sinai Hospital allowed doctors to conduct joint research and to teach and train as geriatric specialists. In 1987, the Kingsbridge facility in the Bronx developed a program for aiding blind and vision-impaired individuals. =1988–present: Modernization and relocation attempts= In 1991, the Sarah R. Neuman Nursing Home in Mamaroneck, New York was purchased by the Jewish Home and Hospital for Aged. In 1997, the Jewish Home's Bronx campus at Kingsbridge Road and University Avenue underwent a major expansion with support from the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York and a donation from the Harry and Jeannette Weinberg Foundation of Baltimore. In the same year, Jewish Home launched a Managed Term Care (MLTC) plan, pre-PACE program (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) with the support of Mount Sinai Hospital and the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty. The entity later became Senior Health Partners. In the early 2000s, the organization's name was changed to the Jewish Home and Hospital Lifecare System. In 2005, the Kenneth Gladstone Building, the second low-income senior housing facility constructed by the organization after the Riverdale House, was completed on University Avenue in the Bronx. In 2006, to address the growing shortage of health care workers, Jewish Home established its Geriatrics Career Development (GCD) program. The donor supported program trains students ages 14 to 24, from “under-resourced high schools”. As early as 2007, there was a plan to demolish two buildings on the main campus in Manhattan and replace them with towers that would feature an increase in private suites, bathrooms, and kitchens. Around 2008, the name of the network was changed again to Jewish Home Lifecare. In June 2010, another affordable senior housing residence, Weinberg Gardens, was completed on Webb Avenue in the Bronx (near Kittay Senior Apartments, Riverdale House, and the Gladstone Building), making it the third Housing and Urban Development Section 202 supportive housing building for older adults. A 72-unit assisted living residence (dubbed the \\"University Avenue Assisted Living Program\\") was opened in the Bronx in 2013. The facility provides affordable housing and care to New York state residents age 62 or older. A new plan to relocate the Manhattan campus to a plot on West 100th Street was unveiled in 2011. The plan called for a 24-story building to be built using the \\"Green House\\" model founded on \\"person-directed care\\" with apartment-like accommodations and shared living spaces. An amended plan that called for a similar 20-story building on West 97th Street was approved by the New York Public Health and Health Planning Council's Committee on Establishment and Project Review in 2012. Legal issues delayed construction of The New Jewish Home's Manhattan campus on 97th Street. In December 2015, The New York State Court of Appeals upheld the Appellate Division of The New York State Supreme Court's decision in favor of The New Jewish Home on a challenge to the environmental impact study of the 97th street site conducted by the Department of Health. In a separate case in October 2018, however, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court revoked The New Jewish Home's building permit for the 97th street site due to zoning issues. The court's unprecedented ruling overturned key decisions by two New York City agencies – the NYC Department of Buildings and the Board of Standards and Appeals. In the fall of 2016, Jewish Home sold its skilled nursing facility at its University Heights campus in the Bronx to SentosaCare. In June 2017, the organization signed a 20-year lease for modern office space at 1200 Waters Place in the Bronx adjacent to the Montefiore Hutchinson campus. The goal of that facility is to consolidate the Jewish Home's Adult Day Health Care programs that resided at the Sarah Neuman Nursing Home in Westchester and its Kingsbridge facility in the Bronx. In December 2017, Jeffrey I. Farber took over as President and CEO, replacing Audrey Weiner who had been CEO for over 15 years. In October 2018, the state Supreme Court's Appellate Division overruled the city's Department of Buildings and the Board of Standards and Appeals which had granted permits to The New Jewish Home to build its facility on West 97th Street. Operations The New Jewish Home operates across three campuses: a skilled nursing facility, short-term rehab, and Adult Day Program in Manhattan; Kittay Senior Apartments and independent and assisted living programs in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx; the Sarah Neuman Skilled Nursing Facility and Short-Stay Rehab facility in Westchester County; and an Adult Day Health Care facility off the Hutchinson River Parkway in the Bronx. The organization provides rehabilitative services, including a substance abuse rehabilitation program, the first program to offer short-stay rehab patients substance abuse recovery services. It also offers skilled nursing, independent and low-income senior housing, long-term nursing and home care, adult day health care programs, and other home care programs throughout the New York metro area. The organization serves over 10,000 older adults at its facilities and in patient homes annually.

Composition, themes, and recording  The album title comes from a Book of Han proverb \\"Thorn on one's back\\" (), referring to a constant feeling of anxiety or unease. The band believed this idiom reflected both their own feelings during the album's creation, as well as the situation of every Chinese person alive in the modern world. The album's unifying concepts were world peace and environmental preservation; many of the song titles contain references to animals or plants. Thorn took almost three years to record, with frontman Ding Wu overseeing every aspect of recording and production. Ding explained the band's decision to produce the album independently, saying \\"today's recording industry as a whole is not thriving. Traditional recording practices are completely obsolete, and record labels do not accommodate the artist anymore[...]we have been considering going independent since completing Romantic Knight. By self-producing this album we have cut out the middleman entirely, which results in a product closer to our artistic vision.\\" He revealed that each member had installed home studios from which they could record, share, and edit musical ideas. Award-winning engineer Li Jun was hired to mix the album. The album was handed over to Sony Music Japan for mastering, and was released on patented Memory-Tech HQCD to ensure top quality. Thorn is a radical departure from the band's folk-influenced sound, featuring drop- tuned guitars, unconventional song structures, and the incorporation of electronic music and field recordings. Two songs, \\"Ups and Downs\\" and \\"Elk Tears\\", which had been previously released on a 2010 EP entitled Ups and Downs sold exclusively at concerts, were rerecorded for the album. The artwork was created by Song Xiaohui, who had previously designed the artwork for the band's second album, Epic.  Release  Thorn was distributed by Guangzhou- based label Starsing Records. Music videos for the title track and \\"Zebra Crossing\\" were released online in September 2013. The album was made available to preorder on October 21, 2013 (preorder editions included a poster and a miner's lamp). The album was released in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Malaysia a day in advance.

A number of Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) were formed for coastal defence in South Wales, and by 8 November 1861 they had been consolidated into the 1st Administrative Brigade of Glamorganshire Artillery Volunteers based at Cardiff with the following components:Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 81–5.1st Glamorgan Artillery Volunteers at Regiments.org.Beckett, Appendix VIII. * 1st Corps formed at Swansea on 10 December 1859 * 2nd Corps formed at Briton Ferry on 2 June 1860 * 3rd Corps formed at Cardiff on 13 June 1860 (absorbed the 4th Corps in 1864) * 4th Corps formed at Cardiff on 13 June 1860 (absorbed by the 3rd Corps in 1864) Also attached to the Admin Brigade were the 1st Glamorgan Light Horse Volunteers (formed at Cardiff 15 February 1861, disbanded 1873)Beckett, Appendix X. and the 1st Monmouthshire AVC at Newport (attached from 1864 to 1866).Litchfield & Westlake, p. 131. In May 1880 the Corps were consolidated as the 1st Glamorganshire Artillery Volunteer Corps with 17 batteries provided by the following Corps: * Number 1, 2, 3 batteries (Swansea) by the 1st Corps * Number 4 battery (Morriston) by the 1st Corps * Number 5 battery (Briton Ferry) by the 2nd Corps * Number 6 battery (Skewen) by the 2nd Corps * Number 7 battery (Neath) by the 2nd Corps * Number 8-14 batteries (Cardiff) by the 3rd Corps * Number 15 battery (Bridgend) by the 3rd Corps * Number 16 and 17 batteries (Penarth) by the 3rd Corps In 1890 the unit's headquarters was moved to Swansea from Cardiff and the Cardiff batteries were detached to form a new 2nd Glamorganshire AVC as a separate unit.Army List, various dates. The commanding officer (CO), Sir Edward Hill, Member of Parliament for Bristol South, first appointed on 22 July 1864, remained Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of both units, though each had its own lieutenant-colonel and Honorary Colonel. The Glamorganshire Artillery Volunteers formed part of the Welsh Division of the Royal Artillery (RA) from 1882 until 1889 when they were absorbed into the Western Division. By 1893 the War Office Mobilisation Scheme had allocated the 1st Glamorgan Artillery Volunteers to the defences at Milford Haven.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893In 1902 the RA's divisional structure was abolished, and artillery volunteers became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). The unit at Swansea was designated the 1st Glamorganshire RGA (Volunteers).Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 4–6. Territorial Force When the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st Glamorganshire RGA (V) transferred to the Royal Field Artillery with the following organisation:Litchfield, pp. 78–9.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 117–23.Ward,p. 10. Territorial gunners training with a 5-inch howitzer before the First World War. 1st Welsh (Howitzer) Brigade RFA * HQ at Park Road Drill Hall, SwanseaSwansea at Drill Hall Project. * 1st Glamorgan (Howitzer) Battery at Swansea * 2nd Glamorgan (Howitzer) Battery at Vere Street, Briton FerryBriton Ferry at Drill Hall Project. * 1st Welsh Ammunition Column at Banwell Street, MorristonGlamorganshire at Great War Centenary Drill Halls. The unit was the senior field artillery brigade in the TF's Welsh Division, and was equipped with 5-inch breechloading howitzers.Conrad, British Army, 1914.53 (W) Division at Long, Long Trail. First World War=Mobilisation= After the order to mobilise was received on 4 August 1914, the units of the Welsh Division assembled at their drill halls. The 1st Welsh Brigade mobilised at Swansea under the command of a regular officer, Major (Temporary Lt-Col, TF) J. Henry. By 11 August the Welsh units had completed their concentration and TF members were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. Four days later the War Office (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. Then on 31 August the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. =1/I Welsh Brigade, RFA= 4.5-inch howitzer preserved at the Royal Artillery Museum. At the end of August the Welsh Division concentrated at Northampton to continue its training. On 18 November the division was warned for garrison duty in India, but this was cancelled and in December it moved to Cambridge, then to Bedford in May 1915. In July the infantry of the division (now renamed the 53rd (Welsh) Division) embarked for service at Gallipoli, but the divisional artillery remained at Bedford. In October the batteries were re-armed with modern 4.5-inch howitzers and on 8 November they handed over their obsolescent 5-inch howitzers to their 2nd Line unit, which had just arrived at Bedford.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 83–90. 53rd (Welsh) Divisional Artillery was now ordered to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. It embarked on 20 November and had concentrated at Pont-Remy by 25 November, from where parties were sent to various divisional artilleries for instruction in front line duties.Ward, pp. 56–7. Meanwhile, after suffering appalling casualties at Gallipoli, 53rd (Welsh) Division had been withdrawn to Egypt to refit. On 30 January 1916 the divisional artillery was ordered to rejoin the rest of the division. The batteries entrained at Pont- Remy, embarked at Marseilles on 3 February and disembarked at Alexandria on 11 February. By 22 February the artillery had rejoined the division at Beni Salama. For the rest of the year the recuperating division was stationed in the Suez Canal defences.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 73. In May 1916 the TF field brigades were numbered, the 1st Welsh being designated CCLXV (265) Brigade, RFA, and the batteries became A and B. Then on 25 December 1916 the divisional artillery was reorganised: A (1/1st Glamorgan) (H) Bty became C (H) Bty in CCLXVII (1/Cheshire) Bde, which took over the number CCLXV, while B (1/2nd Glamorgan) (H) Bty became C (H) Bty in CCLXVI (1/II Welsh) Bde; the Brigade Ammunition Column was absorbed into the Divisional Ammunition Column.Ward, p. 66. Both batteries fought with their new brigades throughout the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of 1917–18, including the Battles of Gaza, the Fall of Jerusalem, and the final victory at Megiddo.Ward. =2/I Welsh Brigade, RFA= De Bange 90 mm French field gun issued to 2nd Line batteries. Although formation of the 2nd Line units began in September 1914, the 2nd Welsh Division (68th (2nd Welsh) Division from August 1915) did not concentrate at Northampton until April 1915, moving in the summer to replace the 53rd (Welsh) Division at Bedford. Training of the units was made difficult by the lack of arms and equipment, and the requirement to provide drafts to the 1st Line overseas. In June the first saddlery and horses began to arrive, but no guns until August, when the brigade received four French De Bange 90 mm guns. Some ammunition wagons arrived in September, and eight more 90 mm guns in October. Training began to speed up. In November the 90 mm guns were handed in, and the brigade moved to Bedford to take over the 5-inch howitzers from the 1st Line. 68th (2nd Welsh) Division was now assigned a role in Home Defence and joined First Army (Home Forces) in Central Force, with its units quartered across Eastern England. In May 1916 the brigade was numbered CCCXL (340) Brigade and the batteries became A and B. However, like the 1st Line brigade, it was broken up before the end of 1916 to provide howitzer batteries to the field gun brigades: A (2/1 Glamorgan) (H) Bty went to CCCXLII (2/Cheshire) and B (2/2 Glamorgan) (H) Bty went to CCCXLIII (2/IV Welsh). They continued to serve with these brigades in Home Defence in Norfolk and Suffolk until the end of the war. Interwar The 1st Welsh Brigade, RFA, was reformed in the 53rd (W) Division in 1920 with 1st 2nd and 3rd Glamorgan Batteries (the 3rd being transferred from the 2nd Welsh Brigade). It was redesignated the 81st (Welsh) Brigade, RFA, when the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921 (becoming a Field Brigade, RA, in 1924 when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery). At the same time it absorbed the Glamorgan Yeomanry giving the following organisation:Titles and Designations, 1927. * HQ at Drill Hall, Swansea, later at Drill Hall, Port Talbot * 321 (Glamorgan) Field Bty (Howitzer) at Drill Hall, Swansea * 322 (Glamorgan) Field Bty at Drill Hall, Neath * 323 (Glamorgan) Field Bty at Drill Hall, Port Talbot * 324 (Glamorgan Yeomanry) Field Bty at Drill Hall, Bridgend Second World War=Mobilisation= The TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis of 1938, with existing units splitting to form duplicates before the outbreak of the Second World War. 81st Field Regiment reorganised as follows:Western Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. 81st (Welsh) Field Regiment, RAField Rgts at British Artillery in WW2. * RHQ at Port Talbot * 323 (Glamorgan) Field Bty at Port Talbot * 324 (Glamorgan Yeomanry) Field Bty at Bridgend 132nd (Welsh) Field Regiment, RA132 Fd Rgt at RA 1939–45. * RHQ at Neath * 321 (Glamorgan) Field Bty at Swansea * 322 (Glamorgan) Field Bty at Neath 81st Field Rgt remained part of 53rd (Welsh) Division, while 132nd was assigned to the duplicate 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division, which became active on 18 September 1939.Joslen, pp. 87–8.Joslen, pp. 65–6. =81st (Welsh) Field Regiment=Home defence Parts of 53rd (Welsh) Division were sent to Northern Ireland from October 1939, and the whole division was stationed there from 3 April 1940 to 30 April 1941 as part of VI Corps.Joslen, pp. 346, 348.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D.Collier Maps 17 and 20. The establishment of a field regiment from 1941 onwards was three batteries, each of two four-gun troops of 25-pounders with Quad gun tractors, and 459 Bty was formed in 81st Fd Rgt.Farndale, p. 99. On returning to mainland Britain, the division served under III Corps and Western Command. On 8 April 1942 it was assigned to XII Corps District, then from 15 May 1943 in XII Corps it became part of 21st Army Group training for the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord).Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/238. Normandy 25-pounders and Quad tractors advancing in Normandy August 1944. 53rd (Welsh) Division was among the follow-up troops landing after D-Day (6 June). Its units were at sea from 21 June and completed landing on 27 June. On 1 July it relieved 15th (Scottish) Division on the River Odon after the Battle of 'Scottish Corridor'.Martin, pp. 51–5. 53rd Division was then involved in the Second Battle of the Odon from 15 July, capturing Cahier and holding on to it by hard fighting.Ellis, Vol I, p. 334.Martin, pp. 73–6. When the breakout from the Normandy beachhead began in early August, 53rd Division cleared the banks of the River Orne and then fought its way towards Falaise to help in closing the Falaise Pocket. By late August its units were across the Seine and driving over open country towards the River Somme.Ellis, Vol I, pp. 408, 440, 470.Buckley, pp. 188–9.Martin, pp. 108–9, 118–9. On 4 September the division cleared St Pol and was working its way through the canal area west of Lille.Ellis, Vol II, p. 6.Martin, pp. 120, 127, 143. Netherlands There was a pause at the Meuse-Escaut Canal before Operation Market Garden was launched on 17 September. XII Corps had an important subsidiary role clearing the country west of XXX Corps' main thrust. 81st Field Rgt crossed the canal on 19 September and went into action supporting the advance of 71 Brigade. There was particularly at Wintelre, west of Eindhoven, which the Germans held for two days, with the regiment firing several barrages and taking some casualties from return fire. The divisional artillery's flank was open, and had to be protected by a company from the divisional reconnaissance regiment; around 50 Germans were taken prisoner within the regiment's gun lines. Afterwards the guns fired frequent Harassing Fire (HF) tasks as the enemy slowly withdrew in front of 53rd Division. On 7 October, the regiment moved into the Nijmegen bridgehead captured during Market Garden. While at Nijmegen one Forward Observation Officer (FOO) was killed, and the regiment's CO, Lt-Col Tyler, was wounded and evacuated.Ellis, Vol II, p. 44.Martin, pp. 145–6, 149–50.81 Fd Rgt at RA Netherlands s'Hertogenbosch, 23 October 1944. After the failure of Market Garden, XII Corps was ordered to advance westwards towards s'Hertogenbosch. 81st Field Rgt left Nijmegen on 18 October and took up its new gun positions by midnight on 20 October. The regiment had to provide its own patrols because there were no infantry between the guns and the enemy – the attacking infantry only moved up at the last moment. Lieutenant-Col R.V. Hills took over as CO on 20 October, and the next day Major R.J.H. Lloyd, who had been in temporary command, was wounded. The attack on s'Hertogenbosch (Operation Alan) began at 06.30 on 22 October, the infantry of 71 Bde advancing behind a timed programme fired by the guns. The regiment also fired at preselected targets on call, and fired coloured smoke to indicate targets for the Royal Air Force (RAF). The infantry made slow progress, but by the end of 23 October 71 Bde was nearing its objectives. Next day 81st Field Rgt fired in support of a fresh attack by 158 Brigade, which went well as the division fought its way into the outskirts of the town; it took two more days of house-to-house fighting to clear the old town, while the artillery fired HF tasks on the Germans' escape routes.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 123–4.Buckley, pp. 244–5.Martin, pp. 173–4. Next XII Corps was switched to clearing the country between the Wessem and Zig Canals as 21st Army Group closed up to the River Maas.Ellis, Vol II, p. 160. 81st Field Rgt moved to Wessem with 71 Bde on 1 November to relieve the Independent Belgian Brigade on the canal line. On 9 November the FOO with 1st Battalion Highland Light Infantry and his signaller were captured by an enemy patrol as they went to their Observation Post (OP) before first light. When the regiment moved to south of Weert, there was no infantry protection in front, and enemy patrols set off tripwire flares close by. On 14 November the division crossed the canal (Operation Mallard) with support from the guns, and on 16 November the regiment struggled across the temporary bridges with 71 Bde, ending the day in front of the defended locality of Roermond. 71 Brigade attempted an assault crossing of the River Maas towards Roermond on the night of 21/22 November. Bridging operations were held up until the divisional artillery was able to suppress the German guns. 4th Battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers, supported only by 81st Fd Rgt, made several abortive attempts to cross the anti-tank ditch, but 1st Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry succeeded, aided by a smokescreen fired by 81st Fd Rgt. Operation Veritable Further operations were halted by winter weather. 71 Brigade Group including 81st Fd Rgt went for rest in Bocholt, Belgium. In December the regiment was required to transfer 25 of its men to the infantry to make up for losses in the campaign so far. On 20 January 1945 the division moved to the Eindhoven area to refit and train for a special operation. On the night of 4/5 February the regiment moved its guns into concealed positions near Groesbeek, while the rest of the men were confined to barracks in Nijmegen and the divisional signs on vehicles were painted over. The Battle of the Reichswald (Operation Veritable) opened at 05.00 on 8 February with the heaviest concentration of artillery employed by the British Army so far in the war. The bombardment hit enemy gun positions, HQs, and communications. After a pause and dummy attack at 07.40 to induce the Germans to man their guns, the Counter-battery fire was resumed and a barrage was laid down to protect the assaulting columns. At 10.30 the full barrage made its first lift and the advance began. 81st Field Rgt fired in support of 71 Bde as usual. 53rd Division's objectives were the Brandenburg and Stoppelberg features in the northern part of the Reichswald. Opposition was not strong but the terrain was difficult. By 02.00 on 9 February the leading units were through the Siegfried Line defences and closing on the Stoppelberg. That feature was taken during the morning and the division pushed on to the edge of the forest, but it was hard to get guns and vehicles along the muddy forest tracks. 81st Field Rgt reported that the second-in-command's OP tank had to be used to tow out bogged guns and tractors ('its only use; in all other respects it was an infernal nuisance'). It took several days for the division to push on through Pfalzdorf towards Goch, mopping up opposition and fending off counter-attacks. Goch fell on 21 February.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 257–67. 53rd Division was not involved in the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder) on 23/24 March, but crossed on 26 March and the next day attacked through Hamminkeln to Dingden. It then took part in the drive to the Elbe.Ellis, Vol II, pp. 293, 305–6, 310. The German surrender at Lüneburg Heath, ending the fighting on 21st Army Group's front, came on 4 May. 81st (Welsh) Field Regiment was placed in suspended animation in 1946. =132nd (Welsh) Field Regiment=Home defence 38th (Welsh) Division underwent training through the winter of 1939–40 in South-East Wales as part of Western Command. Training was hindered by the lack of equipment. After the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk, the divisions at home under training only had about six First World War-era guns apiece. On 15 July the division joined III Corps, part of the Mobile Force stationed in Wales and NW England.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 95.Collier, Chapter VI.Collier, Chapter VIII, Map 5.Collier, Chapter XIV and Map 5. From April 1941 the division was in Southern England as IV Corps' Reserve, stationed behind 47th (London) and 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division along the Sussex Coast.Collier, Chapter XIV and Map 20. 38th Division's Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA), Brigadier H.J. Parham, developed techniques for concentrating large numbers of guns onto a single target in a very short time, and demonstrated them on the artillery ranges at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 104. When the three-battery establishment was introduced in 1941, 132nd Fd Rgt formed 496 Fd Bty. 132nd Field Rgt left 38th Division on 15 July 1942, when it joined 78th Division. This was a new formation being assembled from disparate units for First Army in preparation for the Allied invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch).Joslen, pp. 102–2. Operation Torch 78th 'Battleaxe' Division's insignia. 11 Infantry Brigade Group from 78th Division, including 132nd Fd Rgt, landed in the first wave of Operation Torch. Forward Observation Officers from the artillery accompanied the two assault battalions as they landed on 'Apples Green' and 'Apples White' beaches near Algiers. After landing and consolidating the beachhead, they were to capture Blida Airfield and secure the roads around Birtouta. The landings began exactly on time at 01.00 on 8 November 1942, met no opposition from the Vichy French, and the whole brigade group was ashore before 12.00. It was in position around Birtouta by nightfall.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 140–5. 11 Brigade Group began the march towards Tunis ( distant) on 15 November as the first support troops began unloading at Algiers docks and the air forces began operating the airfields. The group's attack on Medjez el Bab on 25 November failed, but other forces bypassed it and the brigade occupied it the next day and pushed on for Tebourba, only about from Tunis. Early on 27 November, 1st Battalion East Surrey Regiment was widely extended in front of Tebourba when it was attacked by the hastily-formed German Kampfgruppe Lüder. The Surreys suffered heavy casualties and 322 Bty supporting them lost all eight of its guns. The division was involved in bitter defence for the Tebourba Gap against German attacks on 1–3 December, and another bitter battle round Longstop Hill on 22–24 December.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 169, 176–7, 180–1, 187–8. Henry Carr. The renewed Allied offensive in Tunisia began on 8 April 1943 with operations to open the Oued Zarga–Medjez road. For 78th Divisions' attack on Chaouach and Toukabeur the divisional artillery was joined by all the heavy artillery and the foothills were captured without much difficulty; both villages had been taken and an advance of made by the end of the following day. On 14 April the division attacked the hills overlooking Longstop Hill, in four days of hard fighting, but could not hold the final hill, Tanngoucha.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 396–9. On 23 April it attacked Longstop and Tanngoucha again (the Second Battle of Longstop Hill), despite an army-wide shortage of 25-pounder ammunition. This time the positions were taken and held after several days of fighting.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 433–40. 78th Division was then positioned for a direct drive on Tunis (Operation Vulcan). This was launched by IX Corps, supported by all the guns of V Corps including 78th Division. The operation was launched on the evening of 5 May and extended the following day. The weight of artillery fire was immense, with all the guns averaging 368 rounds per gun in the first 24 hours, and the infantry made steady progress. Tunis fell on 7 May and all remaining Axis forces in Tunisia surrendered by 13 May.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 441, 447, 449, 459. Sicily 78th Division had been selected for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) as early as January 1943,Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 264. and after the end of the Tunisian campaign went into training at Hammamet. It was assigned to Eighth Army as a reserve formation for the operation, which began with assault landings on 10 July. 78th Division embarked on 23 July and landed on the beaches near Cassibile between 25 and 28 July. It began moving into its concentration area south of Monte Scalpello on 26 July and completed its concentration on 30 July, just in time to participate in the Battle of Centuripe.Molony, Vol V, pp. 9, 55, 151. Large amounts of 25-pounder ammunition had been gathered for this operation. 78th Division's task was first to relieve 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade across the Dittaino river at Catenanuova and expand the bridgehead, then to capture the hill town of Centuripe. The division began the movement promptly, and began the attack on Centuripe a day early. The divisional artillery deployed wherever it could find positions along the road; as the Official Historian commented: 'In Sicily there grew up the art, further developed in Italy of placing field and medium guns in positions which would have been seen in earlier days, as freakish'. The initial advance across 'immensely difficult terrain' was accomplished, but then there was bitter fighting for the town itself. On the afternoon of 2 August the division's reserve, 38 (Irish) Bde was sent in, supported by 132nd Fd Rgt and the rest of the divisional and corps artillery. The town was cleared by first light the next day.Molony, Vol V, pp. 151–2, 158–60. 78th Division was then sent round the west side of Mount Etna. 38 (Irish) Brigade crossed the Salso on 4 August and the Simeto on 5 August, with strong artillery support. German resistance then stiffened, and 78th Division had to put in a full-scale attack at Bronte and Maletto before capturing the key point of Randazzo on 13 August. By now the Germans were evacuating Sicily, and the division was ordered to stand fast.Molony, Vol V, pp. 174–9. Italy 25-pounder and crew in a waterlogged position in Italy, October 1944. The Allies landed on mainland Italy in early September 1943. 78th Division began to arrive on 22 September, and immediately began advancing towards Foggia and its important complex of airfields.Molony, Vol V, pp. 345–6. Next, it was sent to cross the Biferno and capture Termoli, with two brigades sent round the coast by landing craft and one wading across the river on 3 October. Unfortunately, heavy rain the next day made the river impassable, just when a counter-attack by Panzers was developing. The situation was dangerous on 5 October until Royal Engineers completed a bridge for tanks and guns to get across in support, after which the advance was resumed.Molony, Vol V, pp. 433–6. At the end of October 78th Division was ordered to capture Vasto and the high ground beyond, but rain and mud bedevilled preparations. The division seized Vineyard Hill on 3 November and the enemy began to withdraw that night. By 9 November the division had reached the Sangro, which formed part of the Germans' Bernhardt Line. Patrols could cross the river, but a fullscale operation was needed to establish a bridgehead. Despite the weather the Royal Engineers repaired roads and built bridges. When the weather abated the 6th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers of 38 Bde broke out of the bridgehead and captured Santa Maria on 29 November, supported by all the divisional artillery and a number of other regiments. Next day the brigade swept down the Li Colli ridge to Fossacesia, and took Rocca on 1 December. In the first three days of the Battle of the Sangro, the field regiments fired over 600 rounds per gun. Afterwards the division was sent to rest.Molony, Vol V, pp. 456-61, 485–90, 494. Progress in the Italian campaign bogged down during the winter of 1943–4. The Allies' spring campaign in 1944 began with a renewed attempt to take Monte Cassino, and 78th Division had been moved across Italy to be in XIII Corps' reserve for this. All the field guns in the corps were involved in the preliminary bombardment and then the Creeping barrage laid on for the attacking divisions on 11/12 May. 78th Division was committed to the battle on 15 May in the Liri Valley. At first light on 19 May, 36 Bde was launched at Aquino, supported by all three regiments of field artillery and masked by mist. But when the mist cleared it became obvious that the German positions (part of the Hitler Line) were very strong and the attack had to be called off. However, the weight of artillery overwhelmed the German guns and by 25 May the leading troops of the division reached Roccasecca railway station. The Germans began to withdraw that night, and XIII Corps began a slow pursuit along Highway 6 against rearguards. 78th Division reached Alatri on 2 June and then went into reserve.Molony, Vol V, p. 502.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 78–9, 120, 124–6, 129–30, 179, 201, 241–3, 246–7, 258–9. 78th Division returned to the line for the Battle of Lake Trasimene, working its way up the west bank of the Tiber against strong opposition, 10-24 June, securing Pescia and its river but suffering heavy casualties. The exhausted division was then sent to the Middle East for rest and refit, embarking for Egypt on 23 July.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 26–7, 39, 42–5, 55. Casualties in Eighth Army meant that the division had to return to the Italian front in the autumn, landing on 15 September. The division began assembling around Fano and then moved into the Santerno Valley, on appalling roads that even defeated the 'Quad'.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 371, 390–1. The division held Monte Cappello and Monte Battaglia, but advancing was difficult, and the capture of Monte La Pieve and Monte Spadura took from 13 to 24 October at heavy cost.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 392–7, 418–20. Fighting on the Italian Front largely shut down for winter, but not before more abortive attacks by 78th Division in December.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 116, 125. 78th Division returned to V Corps for the Allied Spring 1945 offensive in Italy (Operation Grapeshot). Once the Senio was crossed, 78th Division was to push through towards the Bastia Bridge on the Reno and on to Argenta. The operation was launched on 9 April behind massed artillery and went according to plan, with 78th Division clearing Cotignola and then moving into the lead. On 13 April 38 Brigade provided the break-out force of battalion groups with field artillery regiments in support. Once the Reno had been bridged, 38 Bde fought its way through and broke out once more, heading for the critical 'Argenta Gap'. By now 25-pounder ammunition was running short, but on 18 April 38 Bde cut in behind Argenta and 78th Division was leap-frogging its brigades up the Via Adriatica. Then it headed for the River Po, arriving on 22 April. After more stiff fighting, the division crossed in pursuit of the disintegrating German forces.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 222, 225, 262–7, 271–3, 281–4, 289–91, 319. Fighting on the Italian Front ended on 2 May after the Surrender of Caserta, and 78th Division entered Austria as part of the occupation force on 8 May 1945, advancing towards Villach and Klagenfurt.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 340. 132nd (Welsh) Field Regiment was disbanded in 1947.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.

Uniforms & insignia Between 1920 and about 1938 the officers and men of 324 (Glamorgan Yeomanry) Bty continued to wear the Glamorgan Yeomanry's Welsh Dragon cap badge. As collar badges, the officers wore gilt Welsh leeks on their blue patrol jackets and bronze Prince of Wales's feathers, coronet and motto in service dress, while the other ranks wore Welsh dragon badges. During and after the Second World War, the whole of 81st and 281st Field Rgts wore RA badges, but after 1967 their successors in the Glamorgan Yeomanry Troop of 211th (South Wales) Bty in 104th Light Air Defence Rgt were allowed the dragon collar badge in No 1 uniform.

Strickland was the first woman to be elected mayor in the U.S. state of Georgia. She was also known for philanthropic work including establishing the first community forest in Georgia. In 2002 she was posthumously named a Georgia Woman of Achievement. Early life and family Alice Harrell was born June 24, 1859 in Forsyth County, Georgia, the daughter of Newton Harrell and Mary Ellender (Harris) Harrell. She married Henry Lenoir Strickland, Jr. (a lawyer and businessman) in Forsyth, Georgia on November 10, 1881 when she was 22. The married couple moved into Strickland's home in Duluth, Georgia. Mrs. Strickland became active in the Duluth Civic Club and Duluth Methodist Church. The couple would have seven children, all of whom attended college and inherited \\"their mother's pioneering spirit and courage.\\" They built a new home on three acres of land in 1898, and it was designed by Mrs. Strickland. Her husband died at age 55 in 1915, leaving her with two children still at home. Activities Strickland remained active after this. As president of the Duluth Civic Club, she volunteered an entire floor of her home to be used for sick children at a time when Duluth had no hospitals of its own. She also donated a portion of her land to Duluth to become the first community conservation forest in Georgia. Strickland was a \\"suffragist from childhood.\\" In 1919 she was among many women who lobbied the Georgia General Assembly (unsuccessfully) in favor of the state's passage of what was then called the \\"Susan B. Anthony Amendment\\" in favor of women's suffrage. Political career Just a year after that amendment was finally enacted as the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920, Strickland ran for mayor of Duluth. She was elected in 1921 at age 62, becoming the first woman elected mayor in Georgia. Duluth at that time had a reputation for drunkenness and violence, and Strickland ran on a pledge to \\"clean up Duluth and rid it of demon rum\\". In office, she was \\"considerate to petty offenders, but severe with those who willingly and flagrantly disregarded the rights of others\\". She was re-elected in 1922. Strickland also showed her spirit when Georgia Power planned to run an electric line across her property against her will. She held a shotgun as she blocked the workers from entering. Strickland lived in her same home until she died on September 8, 1947. She was buried in Duluth. Legacy Strickland was named to the Georgia Women of Achievement hall of fame in 2002. Strickland's Victorian home still exists at 2956 Buford Highway in Duluth. It was among the first sites for the Georgia Historical Society's new historical marker program in 1998, when the house turned 100 years old. It was listed on the Georgia Register of Historic Places in 1999. Since at least 1977, some locals have claimed that the house is haunted by Strickland's ghost. In 2008 the Duluth Historical Society attempted to raise funds to purchase the house, which had come up for sale, intending to use it as a museum. The purchase effort did not succeed, but they were able to lease the house as a site to replace the previous historical museum, whose building had been razed. In late 2014 the society moved to the Duluth Train Depot, another historic building.

She served as a matron for Urania Cottage, a house for what were then called \\"fallen women\\" (prostitutes) founded by Charles Dickens and Angela Burdett-Coutts, as well as the Foundling Hospital during the mid-nineteenth century.  Personal life  Georgiana Collin was born in Merton. She married James Morson, a doctor for St George's Hospital, in 1838. Shortly after their marriage, James Morson was appointed as Chief Medical Officer for the Brazilian National Mining Association. He died in 1848, leaving Georgiana with three children to provide for by her own efforts. In 1854, Morson would resign from her post as matron of Urania Cottage in order to marry George Wade Harrison, a printer and bookseller, and they settled in Sevenoaks.  Urania Cottage  On 26 May 1846, Dickens wrote Burdett-Coutts a lengthy letter stating his desire to open an asylum for girls and women working in London's streets as prostitutes. The letter included planning for the asylum ranging from finding a property in London to a detailed process of rehabilitating fallen women. For example, Dickens suggests introducing a marks system and probationary period for asylum residents. He writes: > It is explained to her that she is degraded and fallen, but not lost, having > this shelter; and that the means of Return to Happiness are now about to be > put into her own hands, and trusted to her own keeping. That with this view, > she is, instead of being placed in this probationary class for a month, or > two months, or three months, or any specified time whatever, required to > earn there, a certain number of Marks (they are mere scratches in a book) so > that she may make her probation a very short one, or a very long one, > according to her own conduct. For so much work, she has so many Marks; for a > day's good conduct, so many more. For every instance of ill-temper, > disrespect, bad language, any outbreak of any sort or kind, so many - a very > large number in proportion to her receipts - are deducted. A perfect Debtor > and Creditor account is kept between her and the Superintendent, for every > day; and the state of that account, it is in her own power and nobody > else's, to adjust to her advantage. Dickens located a home for the asylum originally named Urania Cottage in Shepherds Bush, Middlesex in 1847. He worked closely with Burdett-Coutts in the asylum founding and administration, regularly attending meetings and writing about the home in his journal, All the Year Round. Opening to residents in November 1847, the institution provided food, shelter, and a detailed daily routine for the residents. Residents learned to read and write, worked in the garden, completed all household tasks including needlework, attended singing lessons, and cooked food for local poor relief. Georgiana Morson served as a dedicated matron of Urania Cottage from 1849 to 1854. In her book, Charles Dickens and the House of Fallen Women (2009), Jenny Hartley describes how, \\"Georgiana Morson proved herself the best matron Urania ever had... she taught the girls to read and write, as well as all the household skills a servant needed. She presided over the dining table, and made mealtimes a social occasion the girls had not known before. They ate the good food she had taught them to cook and chattered about their future prospects.\\" Dickens praised Morson's oversight at Urania Cottage in a letter recommending her as matron for the Foundling Hospital in 1852. Writing to the governors of the hospital on 9 July 1852, Dickens describes her \\"capacity for the administration of such an office.\\" He goes on to explain that: > She is a lady of great discretion, of remarkable sweetness of temper, and > has a power of uniting firmness with conciliation in a very remarkable and > uncommon manner. I have never known her to make a mistake even under > circumstances of great difficulty, and I have invariably found that those > under her care have become attached to her. She is accustomed to method, > order, punctuality, and to a habit of sound and judicious observation. I > would entrust her, myself, with the duties to which she now aspires, in > preference to any lady I have ever seen in a similar capacity.

When the 1783 Treaty of Paris gave Florida back to Spain, David Morran returned to England but left his wife in St. Augustine to manage the sale of his properties. She was unsuccessful, and Jesse Fish and James Henderson managed the sale to the Spaniards.  Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board  The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board began the reconstruction of the Blacksmith Shop in late 1967 and completed it in 1968. The home that stood on the site at the time, known as the Judson Property, was demolished in 1967. The Preservation Board’s in-house construction crew built the 12 x 16 foot wooden outbuilding from pine logs that were cut with a broad axe and adze, in accordance with the historic construction methods that would have been used at the time. The shop had a dirt floor with no windows and no insulation. During the 1970s, it served as a working blacksmith shop for San Agustín Antiguo. The board wanted to closely replicate the experience of an 18th century shop and installed a double forge. Visitors could watch the blacksmith, who was a descendant of early Minorcan settlers, making horseshoes and doing more intricate ironwork for other Preservation Board properties.  Present Day  Today the Blacksmith Shop operates as a coffee shop, Crucial Coffee Café. It is managed on behalf of the state by University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc.

It was founded in 1909 and merged into the Nationalist Party in 1917. During its existence it formed a two-party system in the Parliament of Tasmania with the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Although the league was created in the same year as the federal Liberal Party, there were no formal ties between the two. Background Tasmania was the last Australian state to develop formal political parties, both in terms of parliamentary parties and extra-parliamentary organisations. The first statewide political party was the Reform League, founded in 1902. It was soon followed by the Workers' Political League, the forerunner of the current Labor Party.Weller (1977), p. 364. The Reform League was succeeded by the National Association in 1904,Weller (1977), p. 365. which in turn became the Southern Tasmanian Progressive League in 1907.Weller (1977), p. 368. With the exception of the Labor Party, which grew rapidly, the parties were mostly inactive outside of election years. There was little cooperation or central control even during election campaigns, and there was no preselection, only endorsement of existing candidates. Within parliament, there was virtually no party discipline outside of the Labor Party, and the main factions continued to be those supporting the government (known as \\"ministerialists\\") and those opposed (the Opposition).Weller (1977), pp. 361-373. Formation In March 1908, a Farmers' and Stockowners' Association (FSA) was founded with three members of the Legislative Council on its executive committee. In a letter to The Mercury in May 1909, its president Andrew Mansell argued that the National Association and Progressive League had failed due to their lack of support in country areas, and called for the formation of a new anti-Labor organisation.Weller (1977), p. 374. The FSA received support from the local branch of the Australian Women's National League, as well as what remained of the Progressive League. A public meeting chaired by William Burgess was held in Launceston on 20 July 1909, where it was resolved to form a statewide anti-socialist organisation. The meeting adopted the name \\"Tasmanian Liberal League\\", and subsequently put forward a seven-point platform and a draft constitution. A second meeting was held in Hobart on 4 August, which elected a provisional state council that included three members of the House of Assembly. Organisational aspects The new organisation received a boost when Premier Elliott Lewis accepted its presidency, effectively tying together the extra-parliamentary organisation with the anti-Labor parliamentary party. The Liberal League formally absorbed the Progressive League in September 1909. It appointed three professional organisers to tour the state, and by June 1910 was claiming the establishment of 103 branches. The first state conference in June 1911 was attended by delegates from 42 branches,Weller (1977), p. 375. while a second conference in May 1912 was attended by 119 delegates from 86 of the party's 132 branches.Weller (1977), p. 379. Each branch elected delegates to a divisional council, one for each of the five electorates in Tasmania. Each of the divisional councils then nominated four members of the state council, which functioned as the party's executive. Prospective candidates were required to adhere only to the general principles of the party, rather than the entire platform. The party's constitution forbade branches, divisional councils, and state council from putting forward an order of preferences for endorsed candidates. (Under the Hare–Clark system, there were multiple vacancies in each seat, requiring parties to endorse multiple candidates).Weller (1977), p. 377 Political and electoral aspects The party faced its first electoral challenges in 1911, winning two by-elections and helping defeat the federal Labor government's proposed constitutional amendments. At the 1912 state election, the Liberals endorsed 35 candidates across the five electorates, winning 15 out of 30 seats. The party was able to remain in government with the vote of an independent, Norman Cameron. However, Lewis was deposed as leader by Albert Solomon, following a challenge initiated by Norman Ewing. Cameron's support proved to be fickle, forcing the Liberals to adopt an unprecedented level of party discipline; the only major split was on the temperance issue.Weller (1977), p. 378. Due to the parliament's instability, Solomon called an early election for January 1913. The Liberals won back Cameron's seat, finishing with 16 seats out of 30. However, Joshua Whitsitt soon defected from the party and supported a no-confidence motion. Labor under John Earle then formed a minority government. Ewing succeeded Solomon as leader of the Liberal League in October 1914, but was replaced by Walter Lee in September 1915. Lee was able to form a government after the 1916 state election. At federal level, there was no formal connection between the Liberal League and the Liberal Party established by Alfred Deakin in 1909, but \\"in practice the federal leaders and their subalterns maintained a variety of personal links with one another\\". The state party did endorse candidates for federal elections, whose members joined the federal parliamentary Liberals if elected.Loveday (1977), p. 444. In 1917, the party was merged into the National Federation, the new organisation formed by Prime Minister Billy Hughes from a merger of his National Labor Party with the CLP. The Liberal League has been cited as a predecessor of the modern Tasmanian Liberals. It was the first enduring anti-Labor party in Tasmania.Weller (1977), p. 381. =Election results= Note: the changes in seats and votes in 1912 are in comparison with the government vote at the 1909 election. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - !

As a result of the lawsuit Dove v. Parham, it was eventually merged into Dollarway High School. History Prior to the Brown v Board of Education decision in 1954, Arkansas law required school districts to maintain separate schools for black and white students. Traditionally, schools were operated on a neighborhood basis, and this allowed the white-dominated school board to continue operating segregated schools because the neighborhoods themselves were segregated. In 1959 the court case Dove v. Parham ruled that three negro students had the right to attend Dollarway High School. Segregationists including Jim Johnson and Amis Guthridge incited a riot and prevented this from happening for some period of time. Because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the school board reluctantly instituted a choice plan, which resulted in a very small number of black students attending Dollarway, but no white students attending Townsend Park. A very small number of teachers had also been transferred between the old systems. Judge Henley ruled in Cato v. Parham that this did not satisfy the requirement for integration. White members of the school board admitted that race was still a consideration in their zoning, and that they ignored the input of the board's only black member. Judge Henley ordered that the zoning be withdrawn and that the faculty be reassigned so that the percentages were approximately equal to the percentages of the population. In 1970 the schools were finally integrated, with Townsend Park High School becoming Townsend Park Elementary, which it remained until it closed in 2016. High school students were sent to Dollarway High School.

With a practice rooted in theatrical drama and explorative documentary, Mangaard's films explore notions and nuances of freedom within the confines of structural expectations. Mangaard's films are filled with experimental visual effects, footage is often shot in Super 8 and reshot in 16mm and then printed optically frame by frame. The result is a grainy textured look, with images that are saturated in colour. Mangaard is recognised as one of the best contributors to Canada's film development, and is one of the co-founders of the IMAGES: Festival Independent Film/Video. Mangaard has written and directed more than 20 films and installation projects, many of which received awards. Toronto's 2019 Contact Festival features new work in an exhibition from Mangaard, Water Fall: A Cinematic Installation, on at Charles Street Video, May 9–June 15, 2019. Early life and education Born in Lille Vaerlose, Denmark, Mangaard immigrated to Canada with her family in 1960, and was raised in (and around) Scarborough. Mangaard completed an Honours in General Studies program at Ontario College of Art and Design, 1977–1981. In 2017 Mangaard completed a Masters at OCAD University, where she was awarded a medal for outstanding work. Professional life and career Annette Mangaard's recognisable style was initiated in her first super 8 film, Nothing By Mouth (1984), which was an interpretive response to 3 poems by Karen Maccormack. In 1981 Mangaard took a super 8 camera to Baker Lake, Nunavut, a small community in the Kivalliq region of Canada. After a year of hunting, fishing and eating caribou with the Inuit of Baker Lake, she returned with five rolls of film, which eventually became one of her trademark innovative narratives, Let Me Wrap My Arms Around You (1992), which screened at the 1992 Vancouver International Film Festival. Mangaard's first screening involved early film, She Bit Me Seriously (1984), which was featured as a part of the 1985 Cache Du Cinema program at The Funnel, curated by Dot Tuer, John Porter, and Paul McGowan. This film, which was cut together with a hand cranked viewer and tape splicer, was also screened at Millenium, New York (1985), and the Experimental Film Coalition in Chicago (1985), and the soundtrack was played separately on a cassette. Barbara Sternberg describes Her Soil Is Gold (1985) in article, How We Sit and Just Watch It All, included a soundtrack from The Palace at 4am, and was featured in the 1986 Songs of Experience program at the National Gallery of Canada, at the 1986 Canadian International Film Festival, and also Toronto's Festival of Festivals (1986). Mangaard's early body of work also included There is in Power...Seduction (1985), and The Tyranny of Architecture (1987), which screened at YYZ as an installation in 1987, and also at the New Waves In Cinema Toronto program (1987). Following these Mangaard completed The Iconography of Venus (1987), and wacky road flick Northbound Cairo (1987). A Dialogue With Vision: The Art of Spring Hurlbut and Judith Schwarz (1990), was Mangaard's first documentary, and received funding from LIFT. These early films were exhibited widely in festivals and screenings across Canada and America. Mangaard's quirky cinematic style gained much recognition with the release of Fish Tale Soup (1997), a romantic comedy of a contemporary couple trying to have a child, which marked her debut as a feature film writer and director. The 1998 City TV premiere garnered much critical praise and the film screened theatrically at the Carlton Cinema in Toronto and in a number of other theatres across Canada. In 2008, Mangaard was nominated for a Gemini for Best Director of a Documentary, General Idea: Art, Aids, And The Fin De Siecle, for TVO, Bravo, SCN and Knowledge, a one-hour documentary celebrating General Idea, the Canadian artist collective. The film premiered at Toronto's Hot Doc's Film Festival 2008, and went on to screen at the Canadian Art Reel Artists Film Festival, 2009, and garner accolades at the Vancouver International Festival (VIFF), DOCSDF Mexican Documentary Film Festival and Asolo International Art Film Festival in Italy. In 2010, Mangaard produced and directed Kingaait: Riding Light into the World (2010), a film addressing the changing face of the Inuit artists of Cape Dorset for Bravo, TVO and APTN. The documentary premiered at the Art Gallery of Ontario, following a special screening celebrating Canada Day with the Canadian High Commission in Australia. Mangaard presented solo screenings of her films in 1990 at the Pacific Cinémathèque in Vancouver, in 1991 at the Kino Arsenal Cinemateque in Berlin and again in 2002 at The Canadian Film Institute in Ottawa. In February 2009, Mangaard was invited to Argentina for a retrospective of her films at the Palais de Glace, Buenos Aires. Her other films include Into the Night (2006), a film noir produced by the National Film Board of Canada, as well as The Many Faces of Arnaud Maggs (2004), a one-hour documentary on the celebrated Canadian artist/photographer Arnaud Maggs produced for TVO. Documentary Suzy Lake: Playing With Time (2014), premiered in November 2014 at the Art Gallery of Ontario, as part of the Introduction to the Suzy Lake exhibition, which elaborated on images of the artist over five decades. An integral member of Toronto's film community, Mangaard has served on the boards of directors for various arts organizations including: Planet in Focus, The Toronto Arts Council, LIFT (The Liaison of Independent Filmmakers of Toronto), The Funnel, Visual Arts Ontario and the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre. Mangaard is also co-founder and executive director of IMAGES: Festival Independent Film/Video. Themes A common connection between Mangaard's earlier 16mm films stems from a longing to escape the limiting social constructs that humanity has surrounded itself with. By incorporating eroticism, travel and the power that goes along with it, Mangaard's commentary on the futility of the human experience is laid out in such films as She Bit me...Seriously (1984), a lyrical and abstract account of simple gestures of power. Her Soil is Gold (1985), There is in Power...Seduction (1985) and The Iconography of Venus (1987), all contain loose historical references that are tinged with structural critique. Historical detail enters her work again with The Tyranny of Architecture (1987), a film that overtly reverts to Mangaard's autobiographical concern. After producing North Bound Cairo (1987), Mangaard's move from the ethical questions of experimental documentary, to fiction and narrative filmmaking is present in Let Me Wrap My Arms Around You (1992), a personal work that deals with the act of appropriating the artist's life and the life of her lover. Many of Mangaard's works have contributed an integral voice within the feminist movements in Toronto (and beyond) that were working to establish that women are here, women are creating, and women definitely deserve equal opportunities and respect. This feminist voice shines through in the careful treatment Mangaard initiates in her documentary Suzy Lake: Playing With Time (2014), where attention is directed to the role Lake played in how dramatically the art (and real) world has changed for female-identified artists... (and also how things have not changed). Her short film There is in power...seduction (1985), focused important concerns regarding gendered power imbalances, and features an exploration of the symbolic ambiguity of corporate versus sensual power. Does a woman adopt the mannerisms of a man when she enters the territory of corporate power?...The body is language. Power seduces and is seductive. In 2011 Mangaard travelled to Sydney, and presented her video installation Hidden at the Armory Gallery alongside works from Michael Snow, Bonita Ely, Richard Goodwin, Pia Mannikko, and Ian Howard. Bonita Ely's review for the National Sculpture Magazine of China describes Hidden: \\"[it] takes us through liminal zones where nature and urban life are juxtaposed, both ceaselessly transforming, and interrelating\\". After returning to do her master's degree at OCAD University, Mangaard's work shifted from the confines of the screen to an expanded cinematic form of documentary art making. Her MFA thesis exhibition Meltdown (2017) investigates a seascape in multiple forms with media installations depicting enlarged microscopically filmed images of underwater tidal pools and a projected iceberg at various scenarios, refracted from suspended acrylic. The four-minute documentary portrays fishermen working from a repurposed fishing boat. Ice is collected using the tools associated with the harvesting of codfish, for the making of designer vodka. The juxtaposing of works comments on the impact of the environmental changes of water, from an economic, community and personal perspective.

Early life and education Kettering was born July 15, 1907 in Bellevue, Kentucky to architect and marble importer Norman and Clara Weiffenbach. She was their only child. She attended Moraine Park School, where she met husband-to-be Eugene Kettering, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, Carnegie Tech, and Lutherville Seminary. Philanthropist In 1959, soon after moving to Dayton, the Ketterings announced they would donate two-thirds of the cost of building Kettering Memorial Hospital, named in honor of Eugene's father, Charles F. Kettering, who had died the previous year, if the remainder were raised by the community. The hospital opened in 1964. In the 1960s Kettering and her husband worked to create the United States Air Force Museum in Dayton, a pet project of Eugene's. When her husband died in 1969, Kettering took over the project. \\"Her determination, logic, and meticulous attention kept the projects on track.\\" In 1972 Kettering founded the Dayton Holiday Festival and Children's Parade and work was completed on Kettering Tower. In 1974 Kettering conceived and led the development of Courthouse Plaza, a downtown gathering space. Kettering provided the impetus to refurbish the Victoria Theatre, a historic building in downtown Dayton. She conditioned the donation on the development of a downtown performing arts center. The Victoria Theatre refurbishment was completed in 1988 and the Schuster Performing Arts Center open nearby shortly after her death. In 1996 Kettering donated $4 million for expansion the Dayton Art Institute and established a $1 million scholarship fund for Wright State University Medical School students who will serve elderly patients in Dayton for two years. In 2000 Kettering established the $4.5-million dollar Dayton Foundation Virginia W. Kettering Fund to \\"further the public good\\" and donated $2 million to Carillon Historical Park. Kettering was the first individual contributor to the Fraze Pavilion project, which created an outdoor performance space in Kettering, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton named after Kettering's father-in-law. Gifts to the University of Dayton and Wright State University exceeded $16.5 million during Kettering's lifetime. Total gifts throughout her lifetime have been \\"estimated very conservatively\\" at $150 million. The Kettering Foundation supports charitable and community projects in eight counties surrounding Dayton plus the Sloan-Kettering Institute, the Cincinnati Zoo, and Kettering University. Impact In her 2003 front-page obituary, the Dayton Daily News called her, \\"the Dayton region's leading philanthropist and arts patron.\\" Her 1997 induction into the Dayton Walk of Fame said she \\"changed the face of the region through her philanthropy.\\" Dayton Foundation president Mike Parks said, \\"There isn't a sector of our community that hasn't been touched by her generous hand.\\" Personal life Kettering married Eugene Williams Kettering on April 15, 1930. She was widowed in 1969 and in 1973 married retired Mead Papers president H. Warren Kampf. She was widowed again in 1979. She and Kettering had three children. Kettering is buried in Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum. The Ketterings lived in Hinsdale, Illinois until the 1958 death of Eugene's father Charles F. Kettering, when they moved back to Dayton to take over management of the family's interests.

At least 1,200 people died during the storm, and another 4,000 people were injured, with 50,000 people left homeless, making the cyclone the second-deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean basin, behind Cyclone Idai in 2019. It is also the third-deadliest recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, behind the aforementioned Cyclone Idai and the 1973 Flores cyclone. The storm originated north of the island, and local meteorologists expected that the storm would remain away from the island. Consequentially, residents were unprepared until the arrival of the strong winds. For a span of 65 minutes, the calm of the storm's eye occurred on the island, before the winds again increased, reaching , with gusts to . During the storm, the barometric pressure dropped to , breaking the 74-year-old record for the lowest recorded pressure on the island. The damage on Mauritius was so severe that contemporaneous newspapers questioned whether the island would recover. Damage was estimated at £2,000,000 (1892 GBP, $9.75 million USD). Meteorological history Before the storm struck, Mauritius had never experienced a cyclone between April 12 and December 1, which was considered outside of the cyclone season. The origins of the damaging cyclone are unclear. A report from the Royal Alfred Observatory on Mauritius noted that a large cyclone was moving southwestward on April 24, 1892, located north of the island. Over the next few days, the storm either recurved to the southeast, or generated a second smaller cyclone moving southeastward. Regardless, a powerful cyclone struck what was then the British colony of Mauritius on April 29. From 1:25 to 2:30 pm that afternoon, the island experienced the eye of the storm for 65 minutes, before the winds again increased. At 2:30 pm, a weather station recorded a minimum pressure of ; this was the lowest pressure ever recorded on Mauritius at the time, breaking the record set on March 1, 1818. At 3:47 pm, the weather station recorded maximum sustained winds of . Wind gusts reached , which would be the highest winds on the island until Cyclone Carol in 1960. There have been only six tropical cyclones producing a stronger wind gust since the 1892 storm: Carol, Jenny in 1962, Danielle in 1964, Gervaise in 1975, Claudette in 1979, and Dina in 2002. Cyclone Hollanda in 1994 tied the winds produced by the 1892 storm. The cyclone also produced lightning on the island during its passage. Weather conditions quickly improved on Mauritius after the storm moved away from the island. The storm was unusual in its trajectory coming from the northwest; most other Mauritius cyclones struck from the northeast. The nomenclature for the weather phenomena on Mauritius was variously described as a blizzard, cyclone, hurricane, tornado, and whirlwind, although the size and scope of the storm meant it was not a proper tornado. A contemporaneous newspaper article described April 29 on the island as \\"Black Friday\\". Preparations and impact Storm damage in Port Louis For several days, high waves affected northern Mauritius, but the cyclone to the north was expected to remain away from the island. On the morning that the cyclone arrived, the weather observatory sent a telegram, noting that \\"[the winds] will probably not exceed \\". This was the final warning before the telegraph lines snapped. Officials in the capital city Port Louis warned residents about the impending arrival of the storm by firing a cannon, followed by a gunshot. Responding to the warning, all traffic was halted, and residents secured doors and storms shutters. As most houses on the island were constructed of wood, the shutters served as the primary means of defense to the high winds. The island's ports were closed on the morning of the storm's arrival. During a span of about six hours, the cyclone damaged most of the buildings on Mauritius, killed at least 1,200 people, and injured 4,000 others. Six villages were largely destroyed: Beau Bassin, Rose Hill, Phoenix, Vacoas, Rose-Belle, and Mahébourg-Souillac. Residents returned to business during the passage of the storm's eye, which was marked by the rain stopping and the appearance of the sun. After the eye passed, the winds increased from the opposite direction. Many residents were unprepared for the ferocity of the storm, which contributed to the high death toll. Strong winds damaged or destroyed most houses, leaving about 50,000 people homeless, and also wrecked 30 of the islands' 50 churches. The cyclone wrecked 75% of the island's sugar production facilities, completely decimating some plantations, which cut the sugar industry in half. Centuries-old trees were knocked down or stripped of their leaves, with about 200,000 trees knocked down on the island. Rail service was halted due to storm debris on the tracks. Damage on Mauritius was estimated at £2,000,000 (1892 GBP, $9.75 million USD). About one third of Port Louis was destroyed during the storm, with 1,500 houses wrecked and 20,000 people left homeless. There were at least 596 fatalities in the city. Intense clouds gathered in the mountains above the city and unleashed a torrent. High waters sank a dozen barges in the harbor, and washed at least 13 ships onto land, some above sea level. During the storm, at least ten fires broke out in Port Louis, which destroyed 16 houses, and burnt several injured residents to death. The storm destroyed churches and schools, including the Royal College. High winds knocked down trees, lifted the roofs of houses, and flung deadly airborne debris. The winds also knocked out telegraph lines, limiting communications, and damaged rail lines, interrupting travel. Aftermath After the storm, military members and civilians transported the deceased residents of Mauritius by cart through the damaged streets, burying the dead in public cemeteries. Injured residents were carried and treated to the few buildings left standing, while homeless residents were housed in the barracks and the immigration building. Soldiers patrolled the streets of Port Louis to prevent looting. Under order from the island's colonial governor Thomas Elliott, churches were allowed to take rice and tea for injured storm victims. Responding to the death toll from the storm, flags were ordered to be flown at half-mast for eight days. Contemporaneous newspapers questioned whether the island would be able to recover from the storm. The lord mayor started a relief fund to raise funds for rebuilding. Mauritius administrator Eugène P. J. Leclézio requested assistance from the British government, estimating the cost of rebuilding at £800,000. The British government granted loan to farmers, to be repaid after 20 years, to prevent them from going bankrupt. Nearby Réunion island and Seychelles sent resources to Mauritius to assist in rebuilding. Other residents in the British Empire helped the colony rebuild. The United Society Partners in the Gospel raised £1,114 to rebuild damaged churches.

Career Born in Barrhead, Logan began his senior career with local club Barrhead Fereneze before signing for Hibernian, one of the leading clubs in Scotland, in 1902. He was a member of the squad which won the 1902–03 Scottish Division One championship title, although he only featured in two league matches and had been loaned to Airdrieonians in January 1903 until the end of the campaign; the Lanarkshire club won the lower division and gained promotion, but the extent of his involvement is uncertain. He went out on loan again for the next two seasons to hometown club Arthurlie, also of the second tier. He remained with Hibernian for 1905–06 but did not appear in any competitive fixtures for the Leith side and moved on permanently to Falkirk in summer 1906. His form at the Brockville Park club took an immediate upturn (14 goals in 25 league matches) which was such that he came into contention for international selection, and after less than a full season with the Bairns before he was signed by top English club Aston Villa, where his younger brother James had already been playing in the defence for two years. Logan was involved for two-and-a-half seasons at Villa Park (the club finished runners- up in 1907–08) but despite a decent scoring record he was unable to secure a regular place in the team, and returned to Falkirk in the summer of 1909. Once again, he performed well for the club and in 1909–10 they missed out on the Scottish League title by two points (meanwhile in England his former club Aston Villa and brother James did win the championship). Falkirk then signed another younger Logan brother, Tommy, although the siblings were teammates only for a matter of months before Alec's form again attracted the attention of English clubs, this time moving to Bristol City in December 1910. The club suffered relegation from the top tier at the end of his first season, and midway through the second he transferred back to Scotland with Kilmarnock. After a year in Ayrshire, he again moved on during the winter, this time to Partick Thistle. =International= Logan was never selected for the full Scotland team. He represented the Scottish Football League XI twice: a goalless draw against the English League at Ibrox Park in March 1907 and a 3–1 win over the Irish League, in which he scored, in October 1910 at Belfast. The call-ups came during each of his brief but effective spells at Falkirk. Wartime and death The outbreak of World War I ended Logan's professional football career aged 32. His military service included time with the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders for whose regimental football team he was selected in November 1914. He was serving with the 2nd Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders when he died of wounds at No. 30 Casualty Clearing Station on 10 October 1918 during the Second Battle of Cambrai.

In 1991, he formed Downtown, a rock group, and produced their self-titled debut album in 1993. He was a member of the rock band N.EX.T, which he joined in 1994, the metal band NovaSonic and the rock band 2Cell. In 2011, he produced the album Vivaldi: The Four Seasons, reinterpreting portions of The Four Seasons with an electric guitar. In 2014, he became the first Korean artist to have his guitar displayed in the Guitar Center store in Hollywood, at \\"Hollywood's RockWalk\\", a hall of fame honoring musical artists. Life and career=Early life in the U.S.= Kim was born in South Korea and started playing guitar when he was 4 years old, with his first introduction from his mother who had been a classical guitarist. His father was a South Korean diplomat and the family was stationed in Washington, D.C. from 1974 to 1986. Although his mother gave up a professional career after marriage, she gave performances to represent South Korean culture at diplomatic parties, including the Smithsonian, and continued to teach and share classical music with him at home. She also liked 70's guitar music such as Santana and Jeff Beck and made music education a part of his childhood. He said he grew up in a family environment \\"filled with a desire for unification\\" because his father was from Hamhung, a city in North Korea, which helped him develop his personality as a musician who seeks a peaceful consensus. He returned to South Korea in 1986, after twelve years in America, and started his career in the early nineties. =N.EX.T and other bands= He debuted with a rock band of his own called \\"Downtown\\" in 1991, with bassist Jung Han-jeong and drummer Lee Chang-hyun; and produced their album DOWNTOWN in 1993. In 1994, N.EX.T's lead singer and founder Shin Hae-chul met with him and invited him to join the band as a guitarist, and he was with them until they disbanded in early 1998. That year, 1998, he formed the metal band NovaSonic with two other N.EX.T members, Kim Seung-hwan and Lee Su-yong, joined by rapper Kim Jin-pyo; remaining with them until 2005. He rejoined N.EX.T, when they regrouped in 2005, and remained with them until 2012. Also, during N.EX.T's hiatus, he played in the rock band 2Cell; and performed on albums for all three bands. Kim remembers favorite performances with N.EX.T, reheasing at the Royal Albert Hall, performing concerts in South Korea with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and recording their 1997 album Lazenca (A Space Rock Opera) with the London Symphony Orchestra. He performed with the band again on August 8, 2015, for their last appearance at the Pentaport Rock Festival, along with other band members Kim Young-seok and Lee Su-yong, and other musicians, for a special memorial stage for their leader Shin, who died on October 27, 2014. =Performances and collaborations= He has performed and collaborated with musicians including Joe Lynn Turner and Deep Purple, Stuart Hamm, Scott Henderson, Guthrie Govan, Martin Taylor, Akira Jimbo, Steve Vai, Loudness, Lee Ritenour and Vinnie Moore. He has also performed for and represented brands such as Orange Amp, Yamaha, Boss, Roland, D'Addario, Carvin, EMG, Tronical, Suhr Guitars and Gibson. =Classical music= He expanded his musical career with a crossover between rock and roll and classical music on June 23, 2011 with the release of his album Vivaldi: The Four Seasons with the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra. He said he always liked Vivaldi's piece, which he often heard his mother play, as a child. He kept postponing playing it himself until his interest was revived in May 2010 when he performed a duet on the SBS program Stocking with electronic violinist Eugene Park, who also plays the Vivaldi piece. Then on October 24, 2010, he made his classical debut at Sejong Center for the Performing Arts when he performed \\"Winter\\" of \\"Four Seasons\\" with violin and cello. He described preparing for the album, practicing twelve hours a day, as passionate as a middle schooler learning guitar. He said he wanted to accommodate the differences in the sounds of the violin, which has no breaks, compared to the guitar. On the album he used his Suhr \\"Kim Se-hwang Modern Custom\\" guitar, provided for him by the company, to his specifications, after he joined them as a representative in 2010. A year later, in June 2012, he performed Luis Bacalov's \\"Concerto Grosso\\" for I Musici's 60th Anniversary during their South Korean tour. =Television and public appearances= In addition to performing on musical programs, he appeared on television as a judge for KBS's 2012 Top Band Season 2 and MBC Music's 2014 Green Song Contest. In the fall of 2015 through January 2016, he was an original cast member of Knowing Bros, his debut performance in an entertainment show. The show's production team referred to him as \\"one of the three biggest guitarists in Asia\\" during one episode. On August 9, 2012 he performed and served as an events judge with other musicians at the \\"Pyeongchang Special Music Festival\\" for mentally disabled musicians, in commemoration of the 2013 Special Olympics World Winter Games. And he served on the judging committee at the Ministry of Unification's music contest \\"Uni Music Race 2016 (UMR2016)\\". =Lectures and music education= He lectures on music and the philosophy of music and has been a practicing music instructor at Dongduk Women's University, faculty at Seoul Arts College (SAC); and as of 2016, current faculty at Kimpo University and Hanyang University's Social Education Center. Style and influences He has described his inspirations as a long list of \\"Guitar Gods\\" that increases daily, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, AC/DC, Santana, B.B. King, Prince, Eddie Van Halen, Steve Lukather, Def Leppard, and more. Guitarist Stuart Hamm compares his sound to Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Honors and awards In 1997, he received an endorsement guitar, a sky-blue \\"P4 limited\\" from Washburn Guitars, which to his knowledge, was the first for a South Korean instrumentalist from a western company. He was the first Korean performer at the NAMM Show in Anaheim, California in 2013 In 2014, he donated his signature red Yamaha Pacifica Artist Custom \\"Kim Se Hwang\\" guitar for display at the Guitar Center store when he was inducted into \\"Hollywood's RockWalk\\", alongside those of guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Steve Lukather, Kirk Hammett and Slash, among others. In May 2014, he was the first Asian to receive an \\"Honorary Doctorate of Music in Performance\\" from the Musicians Institute in Hollywood.

Designed by Stephen Killough, after which the platform is named, with help from Francois Pin, wanted to achieve omni-directional movement without using the complicated six motor arrangement required to achieve a controllable three caster wheel system (one motor to control wheel rotation and one motor to control pivoting of the wheel). He first looked into solutions by other inventors that used rollers on the rims larger wheels but considered them flawed in some critical way. This led to the Killough system: With Francois Pin, who helped with the computer control and choreography aspects of the design, Killough and Pin readied a public demonstration in 1994. This led to a partnership with Cybertrax Innovative Technologies in 1996 which was developing a motorized wheelchair.

The incident provoked a public outcry and Aleksandar Vučić has repeatedly accused the then ruling Democratic Party under Boris Tadić, both of hiding evidence of Panić's assailant and of under- reporting the incident. On 8 September 2014, an officer of the Niš detachment of the Gendarmery, Nikica Ristić, was arrested on suspicion of inflicting serious bodily injury to Panić leading to his death. Ristić was found not guilty in the first instance by the Higher Court in Belgrade on 10 May 2019.  Background  Panić was born on 15 February 1967 in Karlovac and grew up in Korenica. He was a veteran of the War in Croatia, and arrived in Serbia after Operation Storm as a refugee. Panić lived in Mladenovac with his mother Smilja and domestic partner Mirjana Vujičić. Although he was educated to be a teacher, he worked mainly as a manual laborer and was working as a warehouse clerk for the Granice dairy farm for the past 9 years at the time of his death.  Incident  Following the arrest of ICTY fugitive Radovan Karadžić on 21 July 2008, protests by smaller far-right groups including Obraz and the 1389 Movement had been raging for a week. On 29 July the Serbian Radical Party organized a protest attended by around 16,000 people at the Republic Square in Belgrade called the Pan-Serbian Assembly to protest the arrest and extradition of Karadžić. The protest was co-organized by New Serbia, and supported by the Democratic Party of Serbia. After the protest, a riot erupted between members of the Gendarmery heading from Makedonska street and a group of violent protesters, including football hooligans associated with FK Partizan. The Gendarmery responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. On that night, 46 injured from the riot were admitted into the Emergency Center, including Borislav Pelević, who was hit in the head with a rubber bullet, Miloš Đorelijevski, a journalist for Beta who was beaten by the police despite presenting his press ID, and Oscar Martínez Forcada, a journalist for TVE. Aleksandar Vučić received 4 hits with a baton, and he and Tomislav Nikolić condemned the violent protesters, calling them \\"provocateurs\\". Panić was part of the crowd heading from Makedonska to the Republic Square, according to a friend accompanying him at the time, trying to get closer to Vučić. He was assaulted by a member of the Gendarmery. The following day, Panić complained to his wife about terrible pain in his stomach and was quickly transferred from a clinic in Mladenovac to the Emergency Center. His large intestine was ruptured, and Panić was immediately operated under a heavy fever. After his second operation on 4 August, Panić fell into a coma and died of sepsis on 15 August.  Aftermath = Immediate aftermath = The following day, protesters led by Vladimir Đukanović held a remembrance walk carrying a banner honoring Panić's death and accused the mainstream media of sidelining the affair.Protesters on 16 August 2008 commemorating Ranko Panić's death (in Serbian) Panić was buried at the Rajkovac Cemetery near Mladenovac on 19 August. The burial was attended by high ranking members of the Serbian Radical Party including Aleksandar Vučić. The Radicals obstructed the National Assembly on 2 September asking for information about the use of force at the protest on 29 July and Panić's death. This postponed the discussion on Serbia's Stabilization and Association Agreement. Radical MP Vjerica Radeta damned President Boris Tadić which was condemned by MPs Nada Kolundžija and Suzana Grubješić calling it an act of hate speech. Interior Minister Ivica Dačić announced that an 8-member team had been formed and was working on the reconstruction of Panić's beating. The autopsy findings were released the next day, and the Radicals stopped their blockade of the National Assembly, saying they would wait for an official report from Dačić's team. Before the report was completed, Dačić tried to put the blame on the medical staff responsible for Panić, and draw attention from the role of police brutality. On 16 September, 6 officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were suspended for misconduct. On 22 September, the 16-page report was completed, and included video evidence recorded from the Jugoeksport building released by TV Enter and RTS on 30 July. The report concluded that Panić was kicked in the stomach area by a Gendarmery officer after walking in parallel for several seconds and a possible verbal confrontation, and knocked over with a second kick as he tried to move away. Tomislav Nikolić called the report unacceptable, saying its conclusion that the Serbian Radical Party provided insufficient security equated the role of the Radicals and extremist groups attending the meeting including several football hooligan groups and the 1389 Movement. = Trial = On 8 September 2014, an officer of the Niš detachment of the Gendarmery, Nikica Ristić, was arrested on suspicion of inflicting serious bodily injury to Panić leading to his death. The indictment was filed in December 2015 and the trial opened on 23 December 2016. Ristić announced in November 2016 he plans to remain silent in court. On 10 May 2019 the Higher Court in Belgrade reached a first-instance verdict which found Ristić not guilty. Judge Bojan Mišić concluded that it was impossible to prove without reasonable doubt that Panić was beaten by a police officer, that his injuries are what led to his death and that Nikica Ristić and Ranko Panić are indeed the two men depicted in the footage obtained from the Jugoeksport building. Ristić's lawyer Zora Dobričanin-Nikodinović stated that this was a \\"great day for justice in Serbia\\" and that Ristić was \\"sacrificed not because of justice but politics\\", i.e. Ristić's close relations with sacked Gendarmery commander Bratislav Dikić. Panić's mother Smilja commented: \\"He was not killed by the Ustashe, but by Serbia. My thanks to the state and the judiciary\\". = Legacy = On 29 July 2009, the first anniversary of Panić's encounter with the police, the SNP 1389, a far-right movement with ties to the Serbian Progressive Party, blanketed Belgrade with \\"Who killed Ranko Panić?\\" posters. In 2009, Pravda, a tabloid closely aligned with the Radical and later the Progressive Party, published a book by journalist Predrag Jeremić detailing Panić's life called Uhapšena istina – od Sretenja do Preobraženja (The Truth Under Arrest – from the Presentation to the Transfiguration). The name refers to the dates of the two Orthodox holidays, coinciding with the dates of Panić's birth and burial. The introduction was written by Aleksandar Vučić.Uhapšena istina – od Sretenja do Preobraženja, Virtual Library of Serbia (in Serbian) Vučić has organized commemorations of Ranko Panić's encounter with the police at Republic Square on the first and second anniversary in 2009 and 2010. In 2009, Vučić promised to honor Panić with a street name. On the fourth anniversary in 2012, he made a public visit to Panić's mother Smilja. In 2013, the commemoration was attended by high ranking Progressive Party member Nebojša Stefanović. Vučić has repeatedly accused the Democratic Party leadership under Boris Tadić, as well as the Cvetković cabinet, both of hiding evidence of Panić's assailant and of under-reporting the incident.

It is found in Western Europe. It is a black beetle with buff-orange patches on the front of the elytra. It is a kleptoparasite of digger bees. Distribution Sitaris muralis is found in Western Europe where its range includes the British Isles, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic and Italy, It appears to be an eastern Palaearctic species and is very rare in southern England, where it is on the northwestern fringe of its range. The adult beetle is found in the vicinity of the nests of the digger bees it parasitises, typically in steep loess slopes or in old, sun-warmed walls of houses and in gravel infill under their balconies. Ecology This beetle is a kleptoparasite of bees in the genus Anthophora and has a complex life cycle. In September, the female beetle lays a batch of two thousand or more eggs in the vicinity of galleries and chambers formed by the host bee for rearing its own offspring. When the beetle eggs hatch, the larvae emerge and form a small heap mixed up with the remains of the egg cases. The larvae soon enter diapause until the following May. The larvae then seek out a male digger bee onto which a few beetle larvae climb, clinging to the bee's hairs. In due course this male mates with a female bee and the beetle larvae transfer to her. She hollows out chambers in walls and cliffs, provisioning each with nectar, and laying an egg in each, which floats like a raft on the surface of the honey. She then seals the chamber. At the appropriate moment, one beetle larva loosens its grip on the bee and drops onto the egg raft. Here it feeds, first on the egg, which takes about a week, and later on the honey; it is unable to metabolise the honey until it has consumed the egg and shed its skin.

She did not compete as a two-year-old in 2017 and in the following year she ran mainly in minor sprint handicaps before being stepped up in class to win the Arran Scottish Fillies' Sprint Stakes on her final appearance of the season. In 2018 she made relentless improvement, winning the Palace House Stakes in spring and then being placed in the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes before recording her biggest success in the Prix de l'Abbaye. The highlight of her final campaign was a second win in the Palace House Stakes. Background Mabs Cross is a bay mare with no white markings by her owner, David Armstrong's Highfield Farm near Coppull in Lancashire. She was named after Mab's Cross, a monument in Wigan. In November 2015 the yearling filly was put up for auction at Goffs Doncaster sale and wasbought for £3,000 by Peter Fahey, whose father Richard Fahey trained many of Armstrong's horses. Despite the \\"sale\\" Mabs Cross remained in Armstrong's ownership and was sent into training with Michael Dods at Denton, County Durham. She was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Dutch Art, a British stallion who won the Prix Morny and the Middle Park Stakes in 2006. As a breeding stallion his other progeny have included Slade Power, Garswood (Prix Maurice de Gheest), Caspar Netscher (Nearctic Stakes), Dutch Connection (Jersey Stakes), Baccarat (Wokingham Handicap) and Producer (Topkapi Trophy). Mabs Cross's dam Miss Meggy won three races for Armstrong including the Listed Hilary Needler Trophy. She was a distant, female-line descendant of the Epsom Oaks winner Mrs Butterwick. Racing career=2017: three-year-old season= After being unraced as a juvenile Mabs Cross began her racing career by running unplaced in a six furlong maiden race at Pontefract Racecourse on 11 April 2017. Nineteen days later in a similar event at Thirsk Racecourse she produced a better effort as she finished a close third in a ten-runner field. For her other races that year she ran over the minimum distance of five furlongs and was partnered on each occasion by Paul Mulrennan. On 23 May on the Tapeta surface at Newcastle Racecourse she started at odds of 3/1 for a maiden and recorded her first success as she drew away from her rivals in the final furlong to win by almost four lengths. On 12 June she followed up in a minor handicap race at Windsor, taking a clear advantage in the final furlong and winning \\"comfortably\\" by three quarters of a length. Twelve days later she was matched against older fillies and mares in a handicap at Haydock Park and won \\"readily\\", coming home two and a quarter lengths in front of the four-year-old MIdnight Malibu at odds of 10/11. Following a break of over three months, Mabs Cross returned to the track and was moved up in class to contest the inaugural running of the Listed Arran Stakes at Musselburgh Racecourse on 9 October. The race was intended to be run at Ayr in September but was rescheduled when the meeting was abandoned owing to waterlogging. Starting at odds of 5/1 he recovered from a poor start to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from the favourite Clem Fandango. =2018: four-year-old season= Mabs Cross began her 2018 campaign in the Listed Lansdown Fillies' Stakes at Bath Racecourse on 20 April. She started favourite, but after struggling to obtain a clear run in the closing stages she was beaten a neck by the three-year-old Mrs Gallagher. On 5 May the filly was moved up in class to contest the Group 3 Palace House Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 9/2 second favourite behind the Molecomb Stakes winner Havana Grey. After being restrained by Mulrennan in the early stages she began to make rapid progress approaching the final furlong, took the lead in the closing stages and won by a neck and half a length from Judicial and Alpha Delphini. Paul Mulrennan commented \\"I think she learnt a lot from Bath, nothing went right there, but it stood her in good stead today. She's not got many miles on the clock, so we keep dreaming – she keeps improving... you'd think she'd improve a little bit from today\\". In the Group 2 Temple Stakes at Haydock on 26 May Mabs Cross finished strongly and came home a close fourth behind Battaash, Washington, D.C.and Kachir. In June the filly was stepped up to Group 1 class to contest the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot and started a 20/1 outsider in a fourteen-runner field. She raced in mid-division before making steady progress in the last quarter mile and finished third behind Blue Point and Battaash, beaten two lengths by the winner. When dropped back to Group 2 class and sent to Ireland for the Sapphire Stakes at the Curragh on 22 July she started favourite but was beaten into third place by Havana Grey and Caspian Prince. In the Group 1 Nunthorpe Stakes at York Racecourse in August Mabs Cross started at odds of 14/1 in a fifteen-runner. After tracking the leaders on the stands-side (the right-hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint) she took the lead in the final furlong but was beaten a nose (the minimum possible distance) by Alpha Delphini. The finish was exceptionally close and the judge had to examine the photo-finish for ten minutes before declaring his verdict. Michael Dods said \\"She's run a super race. Obviously we'd rather have won, but what can you do. I would have settled for a dead-heat. When it's that close you're disappointed to get beat, but I'm very pleased with her\\". On 7 October Mabs Cross was sent to France for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which she was ridden by Gerald Mosse and started at odds of 12/1 in a fifteen-runner field. Her opponents included Battaash, Alpha Delphini, Havana Grey, Tantheem (Prix du Petit Couvert), City Light (Prix de Saint-Georges), Sioux Nation (Phoenix Stakes), Soldier's Call (Flying Childers Stakes), Finsbury Square (Prix du Gros Chêne) and Different League (Albany Stakes). After racing in mid-division as Battaash made the running, Mabs Cross made rapid progress approaching the last 200 metres. She gained the advantage from Soldier's Call in the closing stages and held on to win by a head from the 66/1 outsider Gold Vibe in a blanket finish. After the race Mosse said \\"They went furious early on and I didn’t want to rush her too much, as I felt she was needing time to get into her stride. Once she was ready for her effort she did it very nicely and she's a very good filly with a very good record. This was not a surprise\\" while Dods explained \\"We thought about stepping her up to six furlongs, but there is only one Abbaye. That will be it now for this year and I’m looking forward to her coming back and going for all the top sprints next season\\". At the 2018 Cartier Awards, Mabs Cross was a \\"popular winner\\" in a tight vote for the title of Cartier Champion Sprinter. =2019: five-year-old season= On her first appearance of 2019 Mabs Cross attempted to repeat her 2018 success in the Palace House Stakes at Newmarket on 4 May and, with Mulrennan in the saddle went off the 6/1 third choice in the betting behind the three-year-old Sergei Prokofiev (Cornwallis Stakes) and Equilateral. Carrying top weight of 136 pounds, the mare recovered from a poor start to produce a strong late run and overtook Equilateral in the final strides to win by a neck. Paul Mulrennan commented \\"She had to do it the hard way here... that was a brilliant performance. She's a very special filly and she’ll come on a lot for that too.\\" In the Temple Stakes at Haydock three weeks later she came home third behind Battaash and Alpha Delphini after losing a shoe in the race. The mare was then sent to Royal Ascot for the King's Stand Stakes on 18 June and finished fourth of the twelve runners behind Blue Point, Battaash and Soldier's Call. Mabs Cross ran consistently for the rest of the season without recovering her very best form. She finished fourth to Battaash in the Nunthorpe, third to Fairyland in the Flying Five Stakes at the Curragh in September, fifth to Glass Slippers in the Prix de l'Abbaye and ninth to Donjuan Triumphant in the British Champions Sprint Stakes at Ascot on 19 October. In December Mabs Cross was put up for auction at Tattersalls but was bought back by her owners when the bidding stopped at 1,100,000 guineas. David Armstrong's wife Emma said \\"We had a figure in mind and she didn't reach that – that's the top and bottom of it. We'll look at getting her in foal; David's got his mating plans on the table as we speak\\".

Born in East Aceh, he joined the separatist movement in 1997. Following the peace process in Aceh, Minimi spent some time working various jobs before leading a band of armed criminals, disillusioned by the new Acehnese provincial government. In October 2014, he openly declared his stance, and, following the deaths of two Indonesian Army personnel, engaged in conflict with both the Indonesian Police and Army. In late 2015, Minimi agreed to surrender to the central government in exchange for an amnesty. The granting of the amnesty produced some controversy, and as of 2018, the amnesty has not been formally granted. Biography=Early life and GAM= Nurdin bin Ismail Amat was born on 10 August 1979 in Keude Buloh village, Julok, East Aceh Regency. His father, who was killed before the fall of Suharto, fought for the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), and Nurdin received his nickname Minimi – from the machine gun FN Minimi – from him. Minimi, the eldest of four brothers, dropped out from formal education at third grade, joining the separatist movement in 1997. While being part of the movement, Minimi married his wife in 2000. The couple has three children. In GAM, Minimi was part of its unit around Perlak in East Aceh Regency. Minimi was arrested by the Indonesian Army in 2003 and was imprisoned for a year in Langsa. The conflict killed one of his brothers in 2004 and another one went missing. =Post- GAM= After the peace deal between GAM and Indonesian government, Minimi initially worked as a forklift operator in a lumber processing factory owned by a former GAM commander. The factory later closed due to a lack of raw materials, and after a brief stint as a heavy equipment operator Minimi then worked for his friend Adi Maros, a fellow former militant, in a drainage construction project in East Aceh as a bulldozer operator. When the project concluded, Maros remarked that the two remained in contact through their phones. During the 2012 gubernatorial elections, Minimi came into dispute with members of the Aceh Transitory Committee – a body following the peace deal to normalize the situation in Aceh. The committee's members had endorsed former GAM leader Zaini Abdullah for the election while Minimi – despite initially following the position – endorsed former vice governor Muhammad Nazar. Following the dispute, Minimi went away from public view. Minimi proceeded to lead a band of armed men in East Aceh, conducting robberies and kidnappings, including kidnapping a Scottish oil worker in 2013, destroying ballot boxes for the 2014 election and attacking trucks carrying palm oil fruit. Often, Minimi's supporters would claim that the proceeds from the activities were used to help the poor in a Robin Hood-like manner, although later testimonies revealed that the money was distributed among the group. Around late 2014, two separate factions of Acehnese separatists – one based in Aceh, the other in Norway – contacted Minimi and helped his group with funding and personnel. In October 2014, Minimi reappeared into public view, and issued a declaration that the band was fighting against the incumbent provincial government led by Zaini Abdullah and Muzakir Manaf. He issued the declaration through local media, inviting journalists and had photos of him carrying AK-47 taken. The declaration also included admissions of the group's criminal actions and his primary grievances – namely, poor living conditions of former GAM militants. He further added that he was fighting against the Acehnese government and not the central Indonesian government, and was not seeking Acehnese independence. In March 2015, two Indonesian Army intelligence personnel were kidnapped and killed in North Aceh while the pair was tracking Minimi's group. Minimi's group – although Minimi initially denied that his men conducted the killings – was then hunted, with Minimi himself being wanted dead or alive. The Indonesian Army and Police proceeded to engage in multiple armed contacts with Minimi's group throughout 2015 – two engagements in Pidie killed four militants during May, one in July, and another in August. By late October, Indonesian authorities claimed to have arrested 38 and killed 6, while still having 25 in manhunt. The NGO Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict wrote that the police and army were competing with different approaches to try and neutralize Minimi first. =Amnesty= Following a conversation with the military commander of Kodam Iskandar Muda who guaranteed his safety, Minimi briefly returned home that month, but was forced to escape when the local police district chief showed up there. By June 2015, the local military district commander had visited Minimi's home, called for his surrender to the authorities, and again guaranteed his safety. The Kodam Iskandar Muda commander Major General Agus Kriswanto also engaged in phone conversations with Minimi. In late December 2015, Minimi was visited by Indonesian State Intelligence Agency chief Sutiyoso, eventually agreeing to lay down his arms following negotiations. Contact between the two were facilitated by Finnish negotiator Juha Christensen – who had played a significant role in the 2005 peace process. According to Minimi, he spoke to Indonesian President Joko Widodo during the negotiations through Sutiyoso's phone. Aside from amnesty for the members of the group, Minimi also demanded that the Corruption Eradication Commission actively monitor Acehnese governance. Minimi's amnesty received opposition from multiple parties, including lawmakers from Commission I of People's Representative Council who remarked that Minimi's group was an ordinary criminal group, not a separatist one, and hence is not eligible for amnesty. Police chief Badrodin Haiti noted that the police would still legally process the group, although he noted that leniency would be considered. Widodo himself ascertained that an amnesty would be granted. In addition to the controversies, some legal disputes occurred over the details of the amnesty – mainly, whether the militants had to undergo the legal process first or if the process should be waived altogether. The responsible commission of DPR issued its stance as the former. In July 2016, Politics, Law and Security Coordinating Minister Luhut Pandjaitan stated that 70 members of Minimi's group would receive amnesty. As of March 2018, Minimi and his group has not yet been granted amnesty – with at least two members still imprisoned. Despite not having been officially pardoned, Minimi joined Pancasila Youth in April 2016. In an incident that month, a man Minimi's group kidnapped in 2013 assaulted him by punching him in the face when the two coincidentally met after watching a football match. When the Corruption Eradication Commission arrested Acehnese governor Irwandi Yusuf and the regent of Bener Meriah Regency Ahmadi in 2018, Minimi expressed his support.

It is a reconstruction of the home that originally stood on this site during the First Spanish Period (1565-1764) of St. Augustine.  History  It is unknown when the Ribera House was first built. Juan de Rivera was listed as the owner of the property in a 1764 Spanish map. He was a native Tolomato Indian and an artilleryman at the Castillo de San Marcos. He died in Cuba in 1772, and the original structure was torn down circa 1777.  Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board  The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board purchased the Parks Hotel in 1963 and demolished it in 1964 to reconstruct the Ribera House, which was completed in 1965. An old coquina wall had been found under a sidewalk in front of the Parks Hotel. The wall was twenty-three inches thick, thicker than walls of average coquina structures built during the First Spanish Period. Archaeological work was completed at the site by eight students from Florida State University under the direction of Dr. Hale Smith, director of anthropology at FSU, and Robert Steinbach, the archaeologist for the Preservation Commission. The combination of Spanish records and the archaeological records in the 1960s allowed the Preservation Commission to reconstruct the Ribera House with 90% accuracy, said Early Newton, executive director of the Commission. Funds for the project came from the Commission's private foundation, St. Augustine Restoration Foundation, Inc, as well as from donations by Winn-Dixie, Florida Power & Light, and Lawrence Lewis, one of the founders of Flagler College. The house was reconstructed on the original foundations discovered during archaeological digs. It is built of coquina, a type of limestone formed by compacted seashells. It operated as the orientation center of San Agustín Antiguo, the Preservation Board’s 18th century museum village. The house was interpreted as a representation of a wealthy St. Augustine family. The Ribera House Garden became the first formal garden in the restored downtown area. There was a dedication ceremony to open the garden in early May of 1968. The president of the Florida Federation of Garden Clubs, Inc., Carroll O. Griffin, presided over the ceremony. A committee appointed by the past president of the Federation of Garden Clubs, a Mrs. Blanchard, planned the garden itself. The garden held plants of the variety that were known to have existed in colonial St. Augustine.  Present Day  Today the Ribera House is a retail store managed on behalf of the state of Florida by the University of Florida Historic St. Augustine. The adjacent garden is currently being restored with new landscaping and historical interpretation of the site; it will be opened to the public in 2019.

The show was sponsored by Flufenax and the six top matches were shown live on the +LuchaTV YouTube channel. The main event of the show was a three-way steel cage match, which also inspired the title of the event. The match saw Rush defeat long time rival L.A. Park and Penta 0M, as a result L.A. Park and Penta 0M will face off at the Arena Naucalpan 41st Anniversary Show. On the undercard of the show El Cl4n (Charly Rockstar, Ciber the Main Man and The Chris) and Cuervo de Puerto Rico defeated El Hijo de LA Park, Lizmark Jr., Mr. Electro, and Sinn Bodhi, after the match Ciber the Main Man challenged Mr. Electro for the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. The show included six additional matches. Event The Triangular en Jaula event featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The first two matches of the night were held before the video feed went live on the+Lucha channel. The first match of the night was not advertised ahead of time, and saw Emperador Billiante defeat Blue Monsther in a singles match. The second dark match was originally advertised as the third match of the show, but was moved down for unexplained reasons. In the second match of the night Francoise Montañez defeated Dr. Cerebro, after which Dr. Cerebro challenged Montañez to put his wrestling mask on the line at a future date. The first match shown on the live stream was originally advertised as El Solar taking on a Mixed martial arts fighter, but instead El Solar teamed up with his son, El Hijo del Solar, defeating El Hijo del Fishman and Negro Navarro in a tag team match. The fourth match of the night pitted Los Traumas (Trauma I and Trauma II), mainstays in both IWRG and on the Mexican independent circuit, against Blue Panther Jr. and The Panther, a brother team that works primarily in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). The Panther brothers defeated Los Traumas and made challenges for a future match between the two. The fifth match of the night featured Jack Evans, who primarily works for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide in Mexico and Ricky Marvin, a lucha libre veteran who has worked all over Mexico and Japan in his career. Evans defeated Ricky Marvin in what was reportedly a great match. The sixth match was billed as \\"Lucha vs. MMA\\" as luchadors Heddi Karaoui and Zumbi took on, and lost to brothers Jean and Pierre Montañez, older brothers of Fancoise Montañez who wrestled earlier in the night. The Montañez defeated Karaoui and Zumbi as the French visitors showed their dominance in the ring. In the semi- main event IWRG had originally announced that Silver King would return to IWRG and wrestle as \\"Ramsés\\", the role he portrayed in the Nacho Libre movie. On the night Sinn Bodhi replaced Silver King to team up with IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Mr. Electro, Lizmark Jr. and El Hijo de L.A. Park. The four faced off against El Cl4n (Charly Rockstar, Ciber the Main Man and The Chris) and Cuervo de Puerto Rico in an eight-man tag team match. In the closing moments of the match Ciber the Main Man pinned Mr. Electro, positioning himself as the challenger for Mr. Electro's championship. Prior to the main event steel cage match, IWRG officials explained that the first wrestler to escape the cage would be declared the winner of the match and that the two losing wrestlers would face off on December 21, 2018 at the Arena Naucalpan 41st Anniversary Show. The main event marked CMLL regular Rush's return to IWRG, last seen in June 2018 at the annual Festival de las Máscaras even where he and his brother Dragon Lee took on one of Rush's opponents of the night, L.A. Park and his son El Hijo de L.A. Park. The two were joined in the steel cage by Penta 0M before the door was locked. None of the wrestlers were allowed to leave the cage for the first either minutes of the match, leading to all three wrestlers fighting each other without trying to escape the cage. After a couple of minutes of wrestling officials opened the cage door to allow wooden tables, steel chairs, a ladder and even a lamp to be brought into the ring for the wrestlers to use on each other. During the match Rush tore Penta 0M's mask open, exposing part of his face. At one point Penta 0M tried to throw Rush into the lamp, only for Rush to reverse the move, then use the fact that Penta 0M was temporarily incapacitated to climb up the side of the cage and over the top to win the match. As a result of the match L.A. Park and Penta 0M were scheduled to face off in the main event of the Arena Naucalpan 41st Anniversary Show.

He studied Theoretical Physics in Hamburg, centered on general relativity, and got his diploma in 1956, ph.d. in 1959, advised by Pascual Jordan. With Jürgen Ehlers and Engelbert Schücking, Kundt collaborated in a joint seminar, known as Hamburg's 'Jordan Seminar' on general relativity. In 1965, he habilitated at Hamburg on \\"Canonical Quantisation of gauge-invariant Field Theories\\",Kundt, W.: Canonical Quantization of Gauge Invariant Field Theories, SPRINGER TRACTS IN MODERN PHYSICS 40, 107-168, 1966. and was subsequently Lecturer and - since 1971 - 'Scientific Adviser and Professor' at the University of Hamburg. When Jordan had reached retirement age, in 1977, Wolfgang Priester called him to the University of Bonn, where he remained active beyond his own retirement, in 1996, until today. During his career, his scientific interests expanded to include astrophysics, geophysics, and biophysics. During the years 1969-1979, he also conducted the (passive) celestial mechanics experiment E11 of the German-American spacecraft project HELIOS, which for technical reasons had to be eventually sacrificed to the ten active experiments on board. In 1984, Zichichi asked him to direct yearly courses at Erice,Kundt, W.: Observed Neutron-Star Properties - The Crab Nebula and its Pulsar - The Black-Hole Candidates - Neutron-Star Accretion - Supernova Explosions and their ejected Shells, in: Neutron Stars and their Birth Events, NATO ASI C 300, ed.

Kundt, Reidel 1987, pp. 1-28. on 'neutron stars, active galactic nuclei, and jets'. His scientific interests thereby moved from gravitational waves to neutron stars and accretion disks, to the astrophysical jets, to supernova explosions and gamma-ray bursts, further to terrestrial plate tectonics, to the Tunguska event, and to the osmotically pumped water circulation in plants. With these widely spaced interests, he followed his teacher Pascual Jordan, and decades- long friend Thomas Gold; they influenced his almost 300 publications, among them the books \\"Astrophysics, a new approach\\" Kundt, W.: ASTROPHYSICS, A new Approach, Springer A & A Library, 2005, 235 pages.(2005), and \\"Physikalische Mythen auf dem Prüfstand\\"Kundt, W., Marggraf, Ole: Physikalische Mythen auf dem Prüfstand, Springer, 445 S., erschienen: 15. Maerz 2014. (2014). In particular, a new explanation has been given by Wolfgang Kundt in his 1999 analysis of the Tunguska event based on the facts collected by Moscow's Andrei Olchowatow, as the present-day formation of a kimberlite, in which ten megatons of methane were explosively ejected, whose icy remnants in the upper atmosphere caused three bright nights to follow in Europe. He is married since 1966, and has a daughter (Liane), and a son (Rasko).  Selected Works  * Astrophysics. A Primer. Springer, Berlin u. a. 2001, (2nd edition: Astrophysics.

He served two terms in the Michigan Senate following the adoption of the first state constitution.  Biography  Ebenezer Raynale was born in Hartland, Vermont, on October 21, 1804, the son of Ebenezer and Mary Raynale. His father, who died the month before Raynale was born, was a farmer, teacher, and surveyor. When Raynale was three, his mother moved him and his sister Harriet to Brooklyn, Pennsylvania, where she remarried a year later, to Jonathan Sabin. The family moved several more times, to Ovid, New York, Reading, New York, and then in 1819 to Cambria, New York, where they lived until Raynale was 19 years old. He returned to Brooklyn, Pennsylvania, for four years to study medicine, with one more year of study back in Cambria, before he was licensed to practice medicine and surgery in New York. In May 1828, he sailed on the steamboat Henry Clay from Buffalo to Detroit, then settled in Franklin, Michigan, and began practicing medicine. At the time, he was the only physician in Southfield Township. He developed a reputation for sacrificing his own comfort in order to help the poor; he once got lost for an entire day and night in a snow storm after visiting a poor patient in the country, and his bill was just $3. He served as the postmaster of Franklin for seven years after establishing the post office in the winter of 1828–1829. He built a sawmill in 1831 but sold it soon after. In 1835, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention, and in October he was elected as a Democrat to a seat in the first session of the Michigan Senate, and was re-elected in 1837. He became violently ill during a session of the senate in Detroit, and his fellow senators put him in a bed in a covered wagon to go home, believing he was about to die. He recovered, and in the end was the last surviving member of the first session of the senate. Following his time in the state senate, he moved to a farm in Bloomfield Township, and in 1839 he resumed practicing medicine after moving to Birmingham, Michigan. He was again chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1850. Raynale was one of a group of 21 citizens who in 1846 purchased the property of Greenwood Cemetery in Birmingham and expanded it two four times its previous size. He died in Birmingham on March 24, 1881, and is buried in Greenwood Cemetery. = Family = Raynale married Eliza Cassidy, of Springville, Pennsylvania, in October 1830.

Both houses are reconstructions of First Spanish Period (1565-1763) homes built on their original foundations.  History  A 1763 Spanish map shows that at the same lot stood a coquina house belonging to Bernardo Gonzáles and a tabby house belonging to Gerónimo de Hita. Both of these men served in the mounted dragoons and lived near the Castillo de San Marcos. When the two left Florida at the start of the Florida’s British Period (1763-1783), the properties went to Jesse Fish, who in turn sold them to Captain Andrew Rainsford. The lot was vacant for much of the 19th century.  Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board  The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board purchased the land where the De Hita House once stood with funds donated by Elizabeth Towers, a member of the board. The Board (at that time called the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission) won a condemnation suit to acquire the Smith boardinghouse (Gonzáles House) at 33 St. George Street for $17,500. Within thirty days, the Smith property was to be demolished and restorative work continued at both sites. The city of St. Augustine had granted the Commission condemnation powers in 1959 at its inception. After two years of failing to negotiate a selling price for the Smith boardinghouse, the Commission decided to go to court, as a last resort. Archaeological digs led by Dr. Kathleen Deagan of Florida State University revealed the original foundations. The reconstruction of the two homes was completed in 1979 with funding from the Florida Bicentennial Commission.

Public interest-focused accounting research sheds light on the role of accounting in perpetuating unequal social relations, while attempting to rectify such issues via scholarship and the dissemination of research results. It is heavily influenced by the ideas of social theorists, including but not limited to Marx, Gramsci, Foucault, Bourdieu, and Said. History Public interest accounting emerged as a legitimate research domain during the 1970s and can be traced back to practitioner-academics such as Abe Briloff in the United States and a group of accounting academics in the United Kingdom, including Tony Lowe, Tony Puxty, David Cooper, Trevor Hopper and Tony Tinker. For example, Tinker's book, Paper Prophets, developed a political economy approach to accounting, while the book by Cooper and Hopper, Debating Coal Closures, discussed how accounting functions as an ammunition machine within the public sphere. These books, as well as a series of academic articles around the same time, illustrated the public interest consequences of accounting practice and provided the impetus for subsequent research on public interest accounting topics. The role of the accountancy profession The role of the public accountancy profession in working for or against the public interest is a key theme in public interest accounting. Abe Briloff's article, \\"Accountancy and Society: A Covenant Desecrated,\\" argues that public accounting firms have a social contract granting them monopoly privileges in return for protecting public interest. Unfortunately, says Briloff, the profession does not always live up to its societal obligations. Subsequent articles examine whether public accountancy protects the public interest. For instance, a series of high profile articles by Prem Sikka, Hugh Willmott, and colleagues examines moments when public accounting firms have been involved in money laundering and other ethically dubious endeavors. This stream of research does not deny that accounting is a necessary coordination and stewardship device; rather, it draws attention to how the practices of public accounting firms often benefit their rich clients (rather than society at large). Accounting consequences The second stream of research uses a series of detailed case studies to consider how accounting practices divide society, marginalize specific groups, and sustain that marginalization. For instance, studies in this genre have examined the impact of certain accounting practices on indigenous people, including indigenous children. Other studies have analyzed class-based and gender-based consequences. Other studies have examined the impact on the elderly. Taken together, these studies show that accounting is not simply a neutral technique that maps an objective economic reality, but rather participates in creating social and economic reality, often in partisan ways. Accounting interventions The recognition that accounting is partisan has encouraged some public interest accounting researchers to adopt the position of a \\"specific intellectual\\" (that is, an engaged intellectual, as opposed to the traditional notion of the disengaged \\"universal intellectual\\") and to use their academic expertise to intervene directly in public policy debates. This theoretical vantage point follows from the writings of Gramsci, Foucault, and Said, and draws on the notion of \\"speaking truth\\" to the existing regime of power. Studies in this genre have analyzed and intervened in government privatization initiatives, neo-liberal corporate tax reductions, tax avoidance and changes to health and safety, among other topics. Prominent public- interest accounting interveners include Briloff, David Cooper, Christine Cooper, Neu, and Sikka. Publicly-interested academic accounting journals Public interest accounting research has been published in Accounting, Organizations and Society, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, Accounting Forum, Advances in Public Interest Accounting and the Journal of Business Ethics. The American Accounting Association has a specialized journal entitled Accounting and the Public Interest devoted to the public interest consequences of accounting practices.

His throne is surrounded by at least 156 peaceful entities: 12 aeons, aeons of the aeons and angels.H. J. Klimkeit Manichaean Art and Calligraphy 1982 p. 9 When the Prince of Darkness assaulted the realm of light, he invoked entities of light to ward off the invaders. These entities mingled with the demons and gave existence to the earthly beings, thus humans carry consubstantial light particles of the Father of Greatness, but are unaware of them, until they awaken from their sleep by remembering their divine origin. The Father of Greatness responds by creating a series of entities to prepare a rescue for light particles. Theodicy Manichaeism rejects everything associated with evil from the Father of Greatness, the Manichaean deity. Neither can he cause suffering nor is he able to charge.Jacob Albert van den Berg, Annemaré Kotzé, Tobias Nicklas, Madeleine Scopello In Search of Truth. Augustine, Manichaeism and other Gnosticism: Studies for Johannes van Oort at Sixty BRILL 2010 p. 233 He can merely defend. Thus, the power of the Father of Greatness is limited by its own nature. Although he is not all-powerful, in the end time he will have gathered all light particles and evil will be banished into its own kingdom never commingling again. Therefore, Manichaeism also rejects the portrayal of God in the Old Testament, who promises victory over one's enemies (Lev: 26:3-10).Jason David BeDuhn Augustine's Manichaean dilemma, Band 2 University of Pennsylvania Press 2010 p. 176 Accordingly, the problem of evil can be solved straightforwardly as God is limited in his power against forces beyond the world of light and by his own nature.David Vincent Meconi, Eleonore Stump The Cambridge Companion to Augustine Cambridge University Press 2014 p.98 See also *Ahura Mazda *Demiurge *God the Father *Lurianic Kabbalah *Sophia (Gnosticism) References Conceptions of God Gnostic deities Manichaeism ","title":"Father of Greatness"},{"id":"59089020","text":"The University of London Screen Studies Group (SSG) is a research consortium in film studies, founded in 2001.

The prototype flew in an international contest in 1939 and the first of a projected production series was flown before the start of World War II. Design and development The PWS-102 was the second sailplane built by PWS, based in Biała Podlaska. Like the first it was designed by the experienced Wacław Czerwiński, this time with the assistance of Józef Niespał. Both aircraft were high performance, span, gull wing, wooden single-seat sailplanes but the PWS-102 was different in detail in most areas, with aerodynamic and structural refinements to wings, cockpit, fuselage and horizontal tail. It was also equipped with camber- changing flaps. Its design was begun in 1937 but the aircraft was not ready for flight until the spring of 1939. The gull wings of the PWS-102 were high- mounted, with less (5°) inner dihedral than on its predecessor and tapering outwards in both chord and thickness out to fine elliptical tips. They were built around a main and an auxiliary spar, the latter to the rear and carrying ailerons and flaps. The wings were entirely ply-covered but ailerons and flaps were fabric-covered. These surfaces occupied essentially all the trailing edge of each wing, with a pair of differential ailerons outboard and a camber- changing flap inboard. DFS type airbrakes, larger than those of the PWS-101, were mounted on the main spar at about one-third span. The plywood semi- monocoque fuselage had an elliptical section and was more slender than that of the PWS-101. The cockpit was ahead of the wings, where the ply structure ended at half-height and the upper part was covered by smoothly curved, multi-part glazing which reached from nose to wing leading edge. The vertical tail was very similar to that of the PWS-101, with a curved fin and broad rudder but the horizontal tail had a new, elliptical plan, with the hinge between tailplane and split elevators lying on the major axis. Like the wings, fixed tail surfaces were ply-covered and control surfaces fabric-covered. As on the earlier design, the trailing edges of the latter were ahead of the rudder hinge and the elevators were assisted by inboard Flettner tabs. The PWS-102 had a conventional sprung skid for landing but took off on a two-wheel trolley which was immediately discarded. Operational history After its first flight in March 1939 and some small modifications made during an uncompleted development programme, the PWS-102 competed in the ISTUS International Glider Contest held in Lwów in May. It was placed fifth. One production model was completed and flew before the outbreak of World War II, with a second under construction. All three airframes were taken by the U.S.S.R in late September during the Soviet invasion of northern Poland.

She gained popularity on social media on 5 January 2015, when an anonymous person uploaded a picture of her posing with a firearm in an organized crime leak page. The post identified her as a Gulf Cartel member based out of Río Bravo. As a foot soldier, she was responsible for fighting off cells of Los Metros, a rival faction of Los Ciclones, a Gulf Cartel subgroup she belonged to. She was found dead on 13 April 2015, when Mexican authorities discovered her dismembered body inside an ice cooler at a parking lot in Matamoros. Her body had visible signs of torture. She was identified by her distinctive tattoo on her forearm displaying \\"Niño\\", her surname. At the scene, investigators also found another dismembered female and a decapitated man who were reportedly also members of Los Ciclones. A written message at the scene stated she was killed by Los Metros. Career Joselyn Alejandra Niño was a suspected assassin of the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas. She was commonly referred by her alias La Flaca (English: The Skinny One). This nickname was given to her by the Gulf Cartel for her slim body. This moniker is also a reference to Our Lady of Holy Death, a female skeleton saint venerated by thousands in Mexico and popular among some drug traffickers. Organized crime groups in Mexico often recruit females like Niño for their build and girly looks to disguise them from rival gangsters and law enforcement. Women like Niño sometimes begin their criminal careers as organized crime lookouts or prostitutes before they climb their way up to foot soldier ranks. Niño gained notoriety on social media on 5 January 2015, when an anonymous online user leaked a picture of her to Valor por Tamaulipas, a citizen journalist page that post security updates and organized crime leaks. Her pictures made it to Facebook and Twitter. The picture identified her as a Gulf Cartel hitwoman based out of Río Bravo, Tamaulipas; she was smiling in front of the camera and posing with a firearm and bullet proof vest. She was resting her sunglasses on her head and was wearing a golden necklace. The picture's background stirred commentary on the apparent low-income lifestyle of cartel-employed assassins, which seemed to contradict the notion that those working for organized crime groups in Mexico live luxuriously. In addition, others discussed in the comment section whether or not lifestyles like Niño's were worth the risk when organized crime bosses reportedly enjoy most of the luxuries. Her picture was shared more than 40 times and had over 1,500 likes on Facebook. According to investigators, the leak was likely done by a member of Los Metros, a Gulf Cartel faction that was at war with Los Ciclones, the faction that Niño reportedly belonged to. Infighting between these groups had started in January 2015. They suspect this was done to weaken Los Ciclones and promote more leaks of its members on social media platforms. Throughout early 2015, members of the Gulf Cartel leaked information of their rivals on social media to display them publicly in hopes that they could be arrested by security forces or killed by rival gangsters. Niño's faction was headed by suspected Gulf Cartel leader Ángel Eduardo Prado Rodríguez (alias \\"Ciclón 7\\"); Los Metros faction was headed by suspected leaders José Hugo Rodríguez Sánchez (alias \\"El Gafe\\"), Juan Manuel Loisa Salinas (alias \\"Comandante Toro\\"), and Juan Francisco Carrizales (alias \\"Metro 98\\"). Niño worked under Ciclón 7 and was responsible for fighting off Los Metros for at least four months. Her group was entasked with preventing incursions of Los Metros in Río Bravo from Reynosa, Tamaulipas. Río Bravo, where Niño was based, was mostly a turf controlled by Los Metros, which meant that Los Ciclones were at greater risk when conducting operations there. When Niño's picture was leaked on social media, she was identified by members of Los Metros. Sometime between 12 and 13 April, Los Metros captured her along with two accomplices from Los Ciclones. Death On 13 April 2015, Mexican authorities in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, discovered Niño's dismembered body inside an ice cooler. The cooler was abandoned at a Soriana parking lot. The rest of her remains were found inside plastic bags. At the scene, the perpetrators also left another dismembered female corpse and a decapitated man. Investigators suspect that the two people killed with Niño were also members of Los Ciclones. The bodies showed signs of torture, likely done to extract information of their criminal activities. They were then believed to have been executed with a headshot and dismembered. Investigators were able to identify her remains due to her distinctive tattoo with the word \\"Niño\\", her surname, on her forearm. She was estimated to be in her late teens or early twenties. Pictures of the dismembered bodies were first posted on Twitter by Los Metros. The pictures were intended to be a warning for Niño's faction. In one of the pictures, Niño was shown beaten on the ground with the two other victims prior to her dismemberment. In a second photo, her remains were seen inside the cooler. Alongside the bodies, Los Metros left a written message threatening Los Ciclones. \\"This will happen to all the filthy who support Los Ciclones ... Keep sending these fucking assholes\\", the message read. The message also criticized Los Ciclones for using female foot soldiers, and told them they were going to be killing more people in their turf. The message was signed by a member of Los Metros who goes by the moniker \\"65\\".

The club took part in their debut Papua New Guinea National Soccer League season in 2018, finishing second in the regular season and as a result, qualifying for the 2019 OFC Champions League at the first time of asking.  History  The club was founded shortly before the 2018 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League season, declaring interest in their participation as early as December 2017. They were confirmed as participants ahead of the new season in early January. The side started relatively slowly in the campaign, losing their opening match against the previous season's runners-up Madang FC 3–1 after being a goal up, before a narrow 2–1 win over fellow debutants Buang FC allowed them to get their first points on the board. On February 10, the club secured a shock 2–1 victory over NSL veterans Besta PNG United after being a goal down at half-time. A 3–2 defeat to reigning champions Toti City followed, before a 10–1 win over Buang followed, with the side becoming only the second club to ever score double- digits in National Soccer League history, following Hekari United's 10–0 victory over Besta PNG United in the 2009–10 season. As the season progressed, Wawens continued their good form and went into the latter stages of the season in second place, a position which would qualify them for the 2019 OFC Champions League. This final placing, as well as their qualification for the playoffs, was confirmed on the final matchday, 16 May 2018, after Besta PNG failed to beat Southern Strikers in their game in hand, leaving Wawens two points clear of the third-placed side. In the semi-finals, played on 20 May 2018, Wawens were narrowly beaten to the final by Besta PNG United, a side they had beaten home and away in the regular season. Wawens went down 1–0, and went on to play Madang FC in the third-place playoff the following weekend, which they won 2–0. On 25 September 2018, chairman Peter Seske announced that he had secured a sponsorship for the upcoming OFC Champions League and National Soccer League seasons with American company Rush Soccer, a deal with he described as 'historic' for the region and for Papua New Guinea. However, by early 2019, it appeared this sponsorship had evaporated, after it was reported several times in local media that the club were struggling to fund their 2019 OFC Champions League campaign due to lack of sponsorship. In November 2018, the draw for the 2019 OFC Champions League was announced, with Wawens being drawn into Group B alongside Lautoka of Fiji, AS Central Sport from Tahiti, and the runner-up of the Solomon Islands S-League. However, shortly afterwards, it was reported that both Wawens and Toti City might be expelled from the competition, as neither club were currently members of an affiliate association of the Papua New Guinea Football Association – a requirement to compete. These reports were disputed by chairman Peter Seske. However, both clubs ended up entering the competition. Wawens performed poorly, losing all three of their matches and conceding 19 goals, scoring zero. The club had a difficult 2019 season, struggling to capture the form that they had found in the previous season, eventually finishing 7th out of eight teams in the Northern Conference. On 30 March, Laiwaden FC goalkeeper Mikes Gewa was kicked in the ribs by Wawens' Jason Farrock, and the player was hospitalised. The player died just under a month later in hospital. It has been suggested that Wawens were unable to complete their fixtures due to risk of retaliation from fans in Madang. After securing sponsorship for the 2019–20 season, the club donated an undisclosed amount of money to Gewa's family.

Sudduth Interested since before her graduation in the temperance movement, she spent considerable time while abroad in investigating the cause of drunkenness in the countries visited, and as a special correspondent to Bloomington, Illinois papers and the Union Signal, she displayed literary ability. In 1887, upon her return to the United States, she accepted the editorship of the Oak and Ivy Leaf, a publication projected by Mary Allen West. In 1890, her name first appeared as an editor of the Union Signal, to which her services had been rendered from the time of her arrival in Chicago, and in January, 1892, she assumed the managing editorship, where her journalistic ability and cultured mental and literary qualifications were called into requisition. Sudduth died in Los Angeles County, California, September 21, 1957, and was buried at Olivewood Memorial Park, Riverside, California.

Location The hill is located in Bugabula sub-county, Buyende District, in Uganda's Eastern Region. This is about north-east of Kamuli, the nearest town. Kagulu is approximately north of Jinja, the largest city in the Busoga sub-region. The coordinates of Kagulu Hill are 01°13'15.0\\"N, 33°19'50.0\\"E (Latitude:1.220833; Longitude:33.330556). History Oral tradition holds that the Basoga migrated to present-day Busoga from the east, circa 1650 AD. The original Basoga are said to have arrived across Lake Kyoga and settled in the caves at the bottom of this hill. The Basoga have traditional caretakers who live on the hill, going back many centuries. The caves were discovered in 1686, during the reign of Olimi I of Bunyoro Kitara. When Bunyoro conquered Busoga, Prince Mukama Namutukula of Bunyoro made the Kagulu caves his personal residence. The location where Namutukula landed by boat, lies about away, on the shores of Lake Kyoga. To the west of Kagulu Hill, are six smaller hills in a line namely; Kagwese, Mawaale, Mpanga, Nakyeere, Bukolimo and Butadewo. Tourism Kagulu Hill Due to the panoramic view from the top, the rocky hill has become a tourist attraction in the 21st century. From the top of Kagulu Hill, one can view the Victoria Nile, where it enters Lake Kyoga. There is a waterfall, where water emanates from the rocks and cascades down the hill. Exploring the caves at the bottom of the hill offers another activity to visiting travelers.

Career Charter for a local unit of the CPUSA (dated October 24, 1919) In 1903, Dirba joined the Social Democrats and by 1905 a revolutionary. In 1907, he emigrated to the United States and by 1908 had joined the Socialist Party of America. In 1919, Dirba was a co- founder of the Communist Party of America (CPA), following negotiations with Alfred Wagenknecht of the rival United Communist Party. He was at the 1922 Bridgman Convention. By the end of 1922, a single Workers Party of America had emerged. In 1928, he served as secretary of the Central Committee of the Party's Latvian Group through 1939. In 1929, he was elected secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party USA (successor to the CPA). During the Scottsboro Boys Case, Diba served as assistant secretary of the International Labor Defense (ILD). In 1938, Dirba urged the CPUSA to purge its own members in a manner similar to the Moscow Trials of the Great Purge. In 1946, he became a member of the Los Angeles section of the CPUSA through 1950. In 1947, the Lithuanian-American newspaper Draugas called Dirba \\"an extremely shadowy figure who is the confidential agent of the all-powerful Comintern in the western hemisphere, according to Igor Gouzenko, former cipher clerk in the Soviet embassy in Ottawa.\\" In 1962, he was a member of the American Latvian Workers' Union through 1969. Espionage Earl Browder (here, circa 1939) was a CPUSA leader who recruited and/or served as a Soviet spy–like Dirba Historians Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes Jr. have argued that CPUSA leaders (e.g., Earl Browder) doubled as either spies or spy recruiters, and they include Dirba among those. They state that Dirba used the codename \\"Lapin\\" and \\"K. Lapin\\" when sending messages to \\"Randolph\\" (which they deem a \\"generic pseudonym\\" for American representatives to the Comintern). Specifically, in VENONA document # 39, Lapin tells Randolph that \\"a food worker here in New York reports that he has overheard Solomon Rechter's brother boasting to somebody else that Solomon Rechter, in Moscow, was carrying on underground work for Zionist 'black shirts'–the Zhabotinsky group.\\" The sender signed off \\"Comradely yours, K.Lapin, Sec.CCC\\" Death Dirba died age 82 on February 23, 1969.

He was a longtime figure in the Dallas-Fort Worth arts community, working as a composer, choir director, music professor, and music critic. He published over 100 original compositions, including the official mass of the Texas Centennial and The Flower Fair at Peking, the first opera written and produced in the state of Texas.  Early life and career  William John Marsh was born on June 24, 1880, one of six children born to James and Mary Cecilia McCormick Marsh in Woolton, a suburb of Liverpool, England. In the 1870s, Liverpool native James Marsh had worked for the Texas and Pacific Railway in Dallas, where he met Mary Cecilia McCormick, originally from Kentucky. James and Mary both met at Sacred Heart Cathedral, where they enjoyed singing. They married in 1877 and returned to Liverpool shortly afterward; James ultimately became the mayor of Woolton. Young \\"Bill\\" Marsh showed an early interest in music, studying harmony, composition, and organ at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire beginning at age twelve. As a teen, he took his mother's place as the church organist at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Woolton. At age sixteen, he had the opportunity to take lessons with Robert Hope-Jones on his famous electric organ at St. John's Church in nearby Birkenhead. Planning to only stay a year, Marsh moved to Fort Worth, Texas in September 1904 to work at his cousin Morris Berney's cotton business (which eventually became the well-known Neil P. Anderson firm). He planned his cross-country trip across the United States to allow a visit to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. By 1906, Marsh had left the cotton business and was working as the organist at First Presbyterian Church of Fort Worth, a position he held for 36 years. In 1908, he also became the organist at Temple Beth-El synagogue (a position he held for 23 years), the choral director of the Euterpean Club, choral director of the Harmony Club, and director of the Music Study Club chorus. In 1920, he also took on the role of choirmaster at his own church, St. Patrick's Cathedral, in downtown Fort Worth. From 1933 to 1941, Marsh was the director of the Swift Choral Club, a choir formed by employees of the Swift & Company meat packing plant in the Fort Worth Stockyards. He was also the music critic for the Fort Worth Star- Telegram for twenty years. From 1934 to 1949, Marsh was the director of choral activities at Texas Christian University, where he was affectionately known as \\"Uncle Billy.\\" He led the men's glee club on a New York tour in 1939 that included a performance at St. Patrick's Cathedral in midtown Manhattan. He began teaching at Our Lady of Victory Academy on Fort Worth's Southside the same year. In the 1950s, Marsh directed the chorus of the William J. Marsh Music Club and the Marsh Young Artist String Ensemble, which were both members of the Texas Federation of Music Clubs.  Compositions  During his career, Marsh composed over 100 original musical works, mostly religious in nature. He is best known for the following compositions: * \\"Sunset\\" (1913) – Marsh's first published composition, for women's chorus and violin, written for Fort Worth's Harmony Club. * \\"O! Night Divine!\\" (1917) – The highest-selling Christmas song of 1917. * \\"Texas, Our Texas\\" (1924) – Marsh composed the music for the state song of Texas based on an older march he had written for Camp Bowie called \\"Your Flag and My Flag\\" (1918). The lyrics were written by one of Marsh's friends from church, Fort Worth native Gladys Yoakum (1891–1956). The song, though it remains controversial, is used at inaugurations, all official appearances of the Texas governor, state legislative sessions, holidays commemorating state events, Texas school and university graduation ceremonies, and any other occasions where the state is officially recognized. \\"Texas, Our Texas\\" was selected as the state song by multiple appointed committees, but struggled for years to be adopted by the state legislature even though co- writer Gladys Yoakum was herself the stepdaughter of a Texas state legislator. John Philip Sousa called \\"Texas, Our Texas\\" his favorite state song; though it has been described as \\"churchlike\\" and \\"insipid and forgettable,\\" and attempts to change the state song have been made since the 1930s. * The Flower Fair at Peking (1931) – The first opera written and produced in the state of Texas, it premiered at the 1931 Texas Federation of Music Clubs convention in Temple, Texas, under the direction of Samuel S. Losh. * Choral Mass in Honor of the Infant Jesus (1935) – The most popular mass in the United States in 1935, selling over 40,000 copies. * Texas Centennial Mass (1936) – The official mass of the Texas Centennial in Dallas, the piece was performed at a service with 30 bishops officiating and 2800 singers performing under Marsh's direction.  Personal life  Marsh was a lifelong Catholic and became a United States citizen in 1917. He was a charter member of the Texas Federation of Music Clubs, which formed in 1915. He was the chair of the Texas Composers Guild for 25 years and a lifetime member of the Texas Federation of Music Clubs, National Federation of Music Clubs, Texas Music Teachers Association, and American Guild of Organists. In 1959, he was named the Outstanding Senior Citizen of Fort Worth. In 1970, the Euterpean Club and the mayor of Fort Worth proclaimed a \\"William J. Marsh Day\\" in honor of the 40th anniversary of the adoption of \\"Texas, Our Texas\\" as the state song.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Victoria, to the north-northeast. Mount Huber is a secondary summit of Mount Victoria which is on the Continental Divide. History Named in 1903 by Samuel Allen for Emil Huber, a Swiss climber, who, with Carl Sulzer, were first to climb Mount Sir Donald in the Selkirk Mountains. The first ascent of the Mount Huber was made in 1903 by George Collier, E. Tewes, Christian Bohren, and Christian Kaufmann. The mountain's name became official in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Mount Huber is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Mount Huber seen from Shaffer Lake Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Huber is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

Alpheus Trueblood of the Society of Friends, and the niece of pacifist Benjamin Franklin Trueblood. She did her undergraduate studies at Earlham College in Richmond, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1893, and became a mathematics and Latin teacher there. Her cousin, Thomas Trueblood, taught at the University of Michigan, and she went there for graduate study in mathematics and astronomy, earning a master's degree in 1896. Sociological work Trueblood became a fellow at the Boston School of Housekeeping, and was hired by the Women's Educational and Industrial Union to survey job satisfaction among working women in Massachusetts. Her research found that domestic servants were much less happy than workers in factories, restaurants, and shops, in part because of their long working hours and inability to control their free time. She suggested that better education would improve their happiness and job performance. Göttingen and Mount Holyoke After this she studied for a year with Felix Klein at the University of Göttingen, in 1900–1901, as a fellow of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae. Returning to the US, she became an instructor at Mount Holyoke College. While there, she published an article John Dee and his Fruitful Preface, in which she determined that as a young man Francis Bacon had met John Dee, and suggested that some of the discoveries attributed to Bacon were actually Dee's.

It is similar to other British news satire sites such as The Poke and The Daily Mash.

In a 2016 Reddit AMA, Smith said that the site was receiving 2 million views per month. Asked about how writing satire had changed online since he began NewsThump in 2009, Smith told The Big Issue that, \\"Ten years ago, something would happen in the news and we would spend a few hours going through it, knock around a few ideas and maybe publish something on the website. Now if something happens and someone thinks of a good joke, it is a race to get it online.\\" In 2017, he said, \\"People perceive satire to be quite cynical, but people go onto our sites to be entertained.\\" Content The site's articles are presented as genuine news stories, with frequent use of fake quotes, which editor Richard Smith has suggested are intended to mimic the BBC News website. In 2016, he was quoted as saying that \\"if someone shares one of our stories believing it to be true, then we would see that as both amusing, but also a failure on our part\\" but claimed that he was not worried by a clamp-down on \\"fake news\\" by social media companies.Could satire get caught in the crossfire of the fake news wars?

From 1951, she served in various capacities in the Nakhchivan Regional Committee of the Communist Party. In 1963, she was elected Chair of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and served in that capacity until 1990. In January of that year, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union Aliyeva presented the declaration for Nakhchivan to secede from the USSR in protest of the Soviet actions during \\"Black January\\". During her career, she was awarded the Order of the October Revolution, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and an Honorary Decree of Merit from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Early life Sakina Aliyeva, officially Sakina Abbas qızı Aliyeva meaning Sakina daughter of Abbas Aliyeva, was born on 15 April 1925 in Nakhchivan, located in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which was officially part of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic to Almaz and Abbas Aliyev. Her father was a laborer and her mother raised the couple's three children — two daughters and a son. She studied at the Nakhchivan Teachers Institute and went on to further her education at the Azerbaijan State University, and Higher Party School, completing her schooling in 1945. Career As soon as she graduated, Aliyeva joined the Statistical Institute, where she taught in the Soviet system until 1951. Promoted to the Agitprop in that year, she first worked as an instructor in the propaganda department of the Nakhchivan Regional Committee of the Communist Party. She was later promoted to head the department, before being promoted to lead the lecturer's group. In 1958, Aliyeva became the Minister of Education for the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic as a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, serving in that capacity until 1961, when she became the secretary of the Party's Nakhchivan Regional Committee. In 1963, Aliyeva was elected as the deputy of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR representing the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. That same year, she was elected as Chair of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Nakhchivan Autonomous SSR In 1964, Aliyeva was simultaneously selected as Deputy Chair of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR. She was well-known for her focus on improving the status of women and involving more women in Azerbaijani politics, but she also devoted attention to the socio-economic problems of Nakhchivan. She instituted programs to raise the standard of living and address civil protections for the populace of the autonomous republic. In the 1970s and 1980s, she was recognized with multiple awards, including the Order of the October Revolution, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and an Honorary Decree of Merit from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1986, with the assertion of Glasnost policies by Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, ethnic tensions, which had been smoldering between Azerbaijani and Armenian populations for decades, resurfaced when Karabakh separatists saw an opportunity to reorganize the region. Organizing a series of ethnically motivated attacks and demonstrations, the separatists goal was to reclaim Armenian jurisdiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which was within the borders of Azerbaijan. In Azerbaijan, a similar organization emerged to agitate for Azerbaijani sovereignty, the Popular Front. The initial Soviet response was to support the Azerbaijan jurisdiction, as they appeared more loyal to the state. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, authorities came to believe that backing Armenia in the conflict would promote longer-term fields of influence. Declaring a state of emergency, Soviet troops moved into Baku on 20 January 1990, with the intent of stopping the independence movement from overthrowing the Soviet Azerbaijani government. In protest to the Soviet actions during \\"Black January\\" and their backing of Armenia, as head of the Presidium for the Nakhchivan Autonomous SSR, Aliyeva called a special session of the Supreme Soviet of the Nakhchivan ASSR. After debating the legalities of whether Nakhchivan could secede from the USSR under Article 81 of the Soviet Constitution, the deputies prepared a declaration of independence. Aliyeva signed the first secession proclamation by any territory of the former USSR and presented the declaration of independence on television. The declaration was quickly denounced by , who claimed Aliyeva had only signed the agreement under duress, forced by gunmen. She was forced to resign from her post in March, 1990 and was replaced by Jalilov. In 2003, a well-known Azerbaijani writer, wrote Azadlıq carçısı (Herald of Freedom), the biography of Aliyeva's life. Death and legacy Aliyeva died in 2010. A few months after her death, a film of her life Очень любим вас (We love you very much) was released by producer Beyugaga Mamedov of the film studio \\"Salname\\". In 2015, an event held at the held at Tabriz Hotel in Nakhchivan paid homage to Aliyeva on what would have been her 90th birthday.

He served two terms in the Michigan House of Representatives just after Michigan gained statehood, and was speaker pro tempore.  Biography  Hiram Alden was born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, on October 28, 1792. He was the son of Isaac Alden and Irene Smith, and a direct descendant of Mayflower crew member John Alden and Priscilla Mullins. His father may have been a magistrate in Ashfield, but in 1794 the family moved to the small settlement of Western, New York, in Oneida County. In 1800, they moved to Williamstown, New York. While taking a cargo of lumber down the St. Lawrence River in 1811, his father was captured by the British, just before the start of the War of 1812, and after refusing to swear allegiance, he was deported to England and did not return until 1820, dying two years later. Alden studied medicine with his brother-in-law, Joel Rathbun, in Camden, New York, and completed his studies in Cincinnati. He began practicing medicine in Ashville, New York. In 1828, Alden moved his practice to Ripley, New York, and then to Coldwater, Michigan, in 1834. He was elected as a Democrat to the Michigan House of Representatives in its first session after adoption of the state's constitution in 1835, and re-elected in 1837 for a second term, during which he served as speaker pro tempore. He was also president of the village of Coldwater in 1837. He proposed the name for Quincy Township, after the residents' initial choice of either Springville or Springfield was already taken by another town. Governor Stevens T.

Although it was published anonymously, some scholars believe that its author could have been Jerónimo Jiménez de Urrea. Different versions were published between 1561 and 1565, but the most polished and complete version is considered to be the one included in the Inventario, a compilation by Antonio de Villegas that was printed in Medina del Campo in 1565. The book is set in a time where Muslims were discriminated against in Spain and focuses on showing how its characters, Abindarráez, a Moor, and Rodrigo de Narváez, a Christian, can get along despite having religious differences. The story touches on the human aspects such as love and chivalry portrayed by the characters rather than their religious differences. Synopsis The tale is set in the 15th century, when John II reigned over the Crown of Castile. A highly revered knight, Rodrigo de Narváez, is introduced. He performed many heroic feats during the war against the Moors, and for this he is named the governor of Álora as well as Antequera. In Álora, Narváez and his men go out to patrol the city. The group splits up, four squires following Narváez and five squires going alone. The group of five encounters a Moorish man on a horse, and they try to attack him. They are defeated, and Narváez comes over to fight the man. Exhausted from the fight with the squires, the Moorish man is soon overpowered by Narváez. The man falls off his horse to the ground and says that he cannot be “vanquished” by Narváez. Narváez helps the man up and asks him to explain himself, for he is noticeably troubled. The Moor introduces himself as Abindarráez the Younger, a scion of the Abencerrajes of Granada. The Abencerrajes were the greatest noblemen in Granada. Everyone in the kingdom revered them. The king of Granada is told that two of the Abencerrajes and ten other men planned to assassinate the king. The king decides to execute all involved in the plot. The people of Granada mourn the loss of the Abencerrajes. The king decides that no Abencerraje would be allowed to live in Granada except for Abindarráez's father and uncle. Any future Abencerraje must be raised outside of Granada and any daughter must be married outside of Granada. When Abindarráez is born, his father sends him to the governor of Cártama. He is raised alongside the governor's daughter, Jarifa; the children are told they are siblings. They form a close bond for one another and eventually learn that they are not related. They fall in love and try to keep it a secret, but eventually, the king of Granada promotes the governor of Cártama telling him to move to Coín, leaving Abindarráez behind. Jarifa tells Abindarráez of her love for him, and she plans to meet with him when her father is away, so they can marry. This is why Abindarráez was riding past Álora. Moved by his tale, Rodrigo de Narváez allows Abindarráez to go to Coín if he promises to return in three days to be Narváez's captive. Abindarráez finishes his journey to Coín where he and Jarifa marry. Jarifa tells Abindarráez of her plan to give him ownership over her father's land. Abindarráez then tells Jarifa the promise he made to Narváez, and instead of allowing him to go alone, Jarifa journeys with him back to Álora so she can be captive with Abindarráez. On the way back, an old man tells them the tale of one of the many memorable deeds of Narváez. While Narváez was governor of Antequera, he fell in love with a beautiful lady there. He did many things for her, however since she was married, she paid him no attention. When she asks her husband about Narváez, he speaks of him very positively, praising his virtues and deeds as a knight. The lady feels bad she does not love Narváez, and the next day she professes her love for him, but when Narváez learns she is already married, he decides to leave as to not hurt her husband. Abindarráez and Jarifa arrive at Álora. Rodrigo de Narváez takes them in, gives them food and a room, as well as treating Abindarráez's wounds. Abindarráez asks Narváez for help in finding a solution to his troubles. Narváez sends a letter to the king of Granada explaining the situation, telling him he will pardon his prioners' ransom as long as he makes Jarifa's father pardon them for marrying without his consent. Jarifa's father begrudgingly pardons both of them, and the couple return to Coín. There Abindarráez sends a letter to Narváez expressing his gratitude and respect , as well as sending him a gift of six thousand gold coins,a gold coin that was worth 425 maravedis, which is half the value of a doubloon and a quarter of a double doubloon four horses, four lances with gold hilts and tips, and four shields. Narváez accepts everything except the gold, which he sends back. He finally sends a letter to Jarifa explaining his love and respect for Abindarráez. Themes=Generosity= The entirety of The Abencerraje contains themes of generosity. Each of the characters is extremely generous to one another. Rodrigo de Narváez allows Abindarráez to go to Coín to marry Jarifa. Many other stories of this time would see Narváez's character killing Abindarráez, or capturing him rather than allowing him to marry and come back. When Abindarráez and Jarifa return to Álora, Narváez allows them to stay and even helps solve their problems. Lastly, Abindarráez's gift to Narváez at the end of the story is a large sum of money as well as four horses, lances, and shields. =Valor= Although Rodrigo de Narvaez is spoken of as brave and fearless by those who know of him in The Abencerraje, the theme of valor truly shines through the character of Abindarraez the Younger, a Moorish knight on his way to see his lover and complete their marriage. On his journey, he is confronted by Narvaez and his companions on the road near his castle in Alora, where Abindarraez single-handedly bests everyone except for Narvaez. It is later revealed that only Abindarraez's love for his lady, the lovely Jarifa, granted him his strength at that moment, as the two had been apart for quite some time, and Abindarraez was certain nothing would get in his way of reuniting with his bride. The feisty Moor creates such a ruckus defending himself that Narvaez's group is forced to deviate from their patrol to aide in the fight. =Chivalry= In The Abencerraje, chivalry is most often displayed through Rodrigo de Narvaez and his high moral principles through his faith. After he and his men manage to capture Abindarraez the Younger on his way to Coin, Abindarraez is treated with respect and dignity as a prisoner of Narvaez. After Abindarraez explains why he is upset after being captured, Narvaez takes great pity on him and makes a deal with the Moor: if Abindarraez is set loose and returns to Alora after three days, Narvaez will know his worth as a knight and will set him free. Abindarraez is so relieved to be confronted with this offer that he falls at the Spaniard's feet out of gratitude. Abindarraez returns to Alora after three days, this time with his bride, Jarifa. Narvaez is so impressed with the Moor's honor as a knight that he not only sets him free but also welcomes the two as guests into his castle, showering them with comfort, servants and good food. =Loyalty= Loyalty is a prevalent theme in The Abencerraje, most notably being displayed through Abinderraez the Younger after he is captured by the noble Rodrigo de Narvaez. Abindarraez proves he is a man of his word after Narvaez tells him that if he returns to Alora after three days to turn himself back in, Narvaez will set him free as a reward for proving his honor as a Moorish knight. Abinderraez does just that, returning not only after three days, but also be accompanied by his lover Jarifa, after Jarifa refuses to let him return to Alora alone. Adaptations=Theatre= The National Classic Theatre company presented a stage version of The Abencerraje at the Theatre Pavón in Madrid in 2014. It was directed by Borja Rodríguez and adapted for the stage under the name La Hermosa Jarifa (The beautiful Jarifa). The Beautiful Jarifa premiered during the 37th edition of the Almagro International Classical Theatre Festival. The play ran until 2016.

Education and career Schick studied mathematics and physics at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, where he received in 1994 his Diplom in mathematics and in 1996 his PhD (Promotion) under the supervision of Wolfgang Lück with thesis Analysis on Manifolds of Bounded Geometry, Hodge- deRham Isomorphism and L^2-Index Theorem. As a postdoc he was from 1996 to 1998 at the University of Münster and from 1998 to 2000 an assistant professor at Pennsylvania State University, where he worked with Nigel Higson and John Roe. Schick received his habilitation in 2000 from the University of Münster and is since 2001 a professor for pure mathematics at the University of Göttingen. His research deals with topological invariants, e.g. L^2-invarianten and those invariants which result from the K-theory of operator algebras. Such invariants arise in generalizations of the Atiyah- Singer index theorem. Schick, with Wolfgang Lück, introduced the strong Atiyah conjecture. Given a discrete group G, the Atiyah conjecture states that the L^2-Betti numbers of a finite CW-complex that has fundamental group G are integers, provided that G is torsion-free; furthermore, in the general case, the L^2-Betti numbers are rational numbers with denominators determined by the finite subgroups of G. In 2007 Schick, with Peter Linnell, proved a theorem which established conditions under which the Atiyah conjecture for a torsion- free group G implies the Atiyah conjecture for every finite extension of G; furthermore, they proved that the conditions are satisfied for a certain class of groups. In 2000 Schick proved the Atiyah conjecture for a large class of special cases.. In 2007 he presented a method which proved the Baum-Connes conjecture for the full braid groups, and for other classes of groups which arise as (finite) extensions for which the Baum-Connes conjecture is known to be true. arXiv preprint In the 1990s there were proofs of many special cases of the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture concerning criteria for the existence of a metric with positive scalar curvature; in 1997 Schick published the first counterexample. arXiv preprint He is the coordinator of the Courant Research Center's Strukturen höherer Ordnung in der Mathematik (Structures of Higher Order in Mathematics) at the University of Göttingen. A major goal of the research center is the investigation of mathematical structures that could play a role in modern theoretical physics, especially string theory and quantum gravity.

The work was written in simple Hebrew, making it easy for the lay person to understand, and leading to its great popularity.  Contents  The work is a summary of the Shulchan Aruch of Rabbi Joseph Caro, with references to later rabbinical commentaries. It focuses on the Orach Chaim and Yoreh Deah sections of the Shulchan Aruch, and includes laws of daily life, Shabbat, holidays, and so on. It is divided into 221 chapters (called simanim). This work was explicitly written as a popular text and as such is not at the level of detail of the Shulchan Aruch itself, while generally following the Shulchan Aruch's structure. Rabbi Ganzfried expressed his intentions in his introduction:as quoted by mishnahyomit.com Ganzfried based his decisions on the opinions of three Ashkenazi rabbinic authorities: Rabbis Yaakov Lorberbaum (author of Nesivos HaMishpat), Schneur Zalman of Liadi (author of Shulchan Aruch HaRav), and Abraham Danzig (author of Chayei Adam and Chochmat Adam). In cases of disagreement between them, Ganzfried adopted the majority view. Caro had already used a similar method to write the Shulchan Aruch in 1563; his rabbinic authorities of reference were Isaac Alfasi, Maimonides, and Asher ben Yechiel. Ganzfried was a Hungarian Jew, and put the emphasis of his work on the customs of the Hungarian Jews of his time. The work is also known for its strict rulings.Michael J. Broyde and Shlomo C. Pill, Building the Set Table: An Introduction to the Jurisprudence of Rabbi Yehiel Mikhel Epstein’s Arukh ha-Shulhan in Contrast to the Mishnah Berurah, p.32  Reception  The Kitzur became immensely popular after its publication for its simplicity, and is still a popular book in Orthodox Rabbinic Judaism where it is commonly studied. Many other works – Ben Ish Hai, Chayei Adam and others – are also concise, and suitable for laypersons as summaries of the Shulchan Aruch, but did not reach the level of the Kitzur's popularity. It is thought that the title added to this book's immediate and continuing popularity. The Kitzur is not used as a basis for making decisions of a legal nature; instead, rabbis use the full Shulchan Aruch and later works by the achronim and poskim. Due to its popularity, this book is often printed with cross references of other halacha works, especially the Shulchan Aruch HaRav or the Mishna Berura; a popular edition contains notes by Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, entitled Darkeh Halacha, with cross-references of the Sephardic rabbinical authorities. Many editions of the Kitzur include an appendix with the laws pertaining to the Land of Israel, which were compiled by the Chazon Ish. There is a commentary by Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Braun on this work, entitled Shearim Metzuyanim be- Halakhah, which examines contemporary problems in the light of the work. Ganzfried, however, stated that comments were not needed for this work, since it tried to summarize the Halacha as far as possible, and that these comments should be included in the original Shulchan Aruch, and not in the Kitzur. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Yomi (\\"Daily Kitzur Shulchan Aruch\\") is a daily learning program where the study of this work is completed in one year. The schedule does not follow the contents in order; rather it is arranged such that one reviews the laws of the Jewish holidays in the weeks before each. A person can start learning at any time of the year and complete it over the course of the year. The program is increasingly popular as it requires only 5 – 10 minutes per day.  Translations  The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch has been translated into English several times. Hyman E. Goldin's translation was published in 1961 with an attempt to eliminate errors and improve upon previous translations, making it \\"more comprehensible to scholar and layperson alike.\\"Goldin, Hyman E. Kitzur Shulchan Aruch – Code of Jewish Law, Forward to the New Edition. (New York: Hebrew Publishing Company, 1961) Goldin's translation bore the English title \\"Code of Jewish Law\\", and it is thought that this title added to the popularity of the translated book, although the title is misleading. The 1980s and 90s saw the publication of two modernized translations, which included cross references similar to those in contemporary Hebrew editions as above: in 1987 Metsudah Publications released a translation by Rabbi Avrohom Davis,Metsudah Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (3 Volumes). and in 1991 Moznaim Publishing released a translation by Rabbi Eliyahu Touger.Kitzur Schulchan Oruch - Code of Jewish Law (2 Volumes). The Artscroll translation of 2011,The Kleinman Edition Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (5 Volumes). under the general editorship of Rabbi Eliyahu Klugman, includes comparisons with the Mishnah Berurah and the Igrot Moshe of Moshe Feinstein.

It is a reworking of his 1876 painting On The Thames, which also depicts a man and two women in a boat. It measures . The painting depicts three people sitting in a rowing boat among the towering naval vessels in Portsmouth Dockyard, with another rowing boat crewed by naval personnel passing in the background before the bows of two old-fashioned square rigged ships of the line. In the background is a modern ironclad warship. In the centre is a man wearing the uniform of a sergeant in a Highland Regiment, with redcoat, kilt, and feather bonnet. He sits with his legs crossed, and his hands clasped around one bare knee. He is turning away from the unhappy woman to his left - in cream dress and tartan shawl or blanket, and her parasol up - and towards the smiling woman to his right - in white and black striped dress, with shawl over her arm and parasol furled. This 1877 painting is a reworking of Tissot's 1876 painting On The Thames, which depicts a man and two women reclining lazily aboard a boat moving through crowded shipping on the River Thames. On The Thames was shown at the Royal Academy in 1876 but it was poorly received, with critics questioning the sexual morality of the subjects: one critic described it as \\"wilfully vulgar\\", and another disparagingly as \\"more French than English\\". Tissot's less ambiguous 1877 reworking of the subject in Portsmouth Dockyard was more favourably received, but the story remains unclear. Perhaps there is some flirtation between the man and the woman to the left; perhaps the second woman a chaperone, or a sister. The painting was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 under the title Portsmouth Dockyard. The same year, Tissot made a drypoint copy of the painting, which was reproduced as an etching in two editions of around 100 prints each, measuring , under the French title Entre les Deux mon Coeur balance (literally, \\"Between the two my heart swings\\"; sometimes translated as \\"How happy I could be with either\\"). An etching of the drypoint reproduction was sold at Sotheby's in 2013 for £1,125, described as a work on \\"the theme of comic rivalry in the affairs of the heart\\", and one was sold at Bonhams in 2018 for $937. The painting was bought by the Lancashire corn merchant Henry Jump, and descended through his family. It was sold at Christie's in 1937 under the title Divided Attention, bought by Leicester Galleries for 58 guineas, and exhibited at Leicester Galleries under the title Entre les Deux mon Coeur balance (the title of Tissot's drypoint and etching of the same subject). The painting was sold to Sir Hugh Walpole, who left it to the Tate Gallery on his death in 1941. The Tate first exhibited it in 1942 under the title How happy could he be with either, later returning to the original title Portsmouth Dockyard. It remains in the collection of the Tate.

It depicts two ladies in fashionable clothing and a young naval lieutenant, standing on the quarter gallery at the stern of the Royal Navy warship HMS Calcutta. The painting is held by the Tate Gallery in London and measures . Background HMS Calcutta was an 84-gun second rate ship of the line, built from teak in Bombay in 1831. After a period in reserve, she was recommissioned in 1855 to serve in the Baltic in the Crimean War, and then served in the Second Opium War in the Far East in 1856-8. She was the British ship of the line to visit Japan in 1858. She became a gunnery training ship in 1865, and by 1876 was alongside HMS Cambridge in Portsmouth Dockyard. Astern of the Calcutta was the hulk of HMS Queen Charlotte which housed the navy's gunnery school, HMS Excellent. Tissot was a French painter.

Description The painting is typical of Tissot's work, depicting his subjects with almost photographic realism, with an ambiguous narrative that hints at risqué behaviour among the wealthy classes approaching or transgressing boundaries of propriety. Tissot's work depicts two women with a young man in a flirtatious situation, but with a dangerous sensual undercurrent of moral uncertainty.\\"The Gallery of HMS Calcutta (Portsmouth), c.1876\\". Tate. Retrieved 18 November 2018 The man is dressed plainly in the uniform of a junior naval officer. Each woman is wearing a fashionable gauzy white dress decorated with bows and ribbons, with a tightly fitting bodice over a corset and full skirts below the hips . One woman, in a dress decorated with yellow ribbons, is leaning over the railing of the ship's quarter gallery, turning her head away as she hides her face from the naval officer behind her fan. In the European hand fans in the 18th century language of the fan, an open fan over left ear indicates \\"do not betray our secret\\". Her hourglass figure is echoed by the curves of the gallery's iron railings. Tissot's reference to HMS Calcutta may be making a punning on the French phrase \\"Quel cul tu as\\" (\\"What an arse you have\\"). Another woman in similar white dress with yellow ribbons appears in Tissot's 1876 painting Summer. The second woman in the painting, wearing a dress with blue ribbons, may be a chaperone, or possibly the officer's wife: he stands beside her, and wears a wedding ring, but he only has eyes for the first woman. The overdressed woman have a touch of vulgarity. The presence of others in the party is suggested by a line of chairs beside the windows of the gallery: perhaps they are sitting out a dance at a ball on board. Several troop ships are in the background, under smoky grey skies. Tissot pays attention to the details of the women's clothing and the ship's railings.

For several years, she was National Superintendent of the Flower Mission Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Early years and education Alice Lucy Sudduth was born near Athens, Illinois, June 18, 1855. Her parents were Dr. James McCreary Sudduth (d. 1895) and Amanda Elizabeth (Ashmore) Sudduth (d. 1898). She had two siblings, a brother, Dr. William Xavier Sudduth, and a sister, Margaret Ashmore Sudduth. Her father had built up an extensive practice in Central Illinois before giving up the practice of medicine to become a banker and stock raiser. She was converted in childhood, and brought up in the Presbyterian Church, of which her parents were members. When about eleven years of age, her parents moved to Normal, Illinois, for the purpose of educating their children. Here, and at Bloomington, Illinois, the family lived for twenty years. She received her education in the public schools and Normal university, afterwards taking a course at Mills College, Oakland, California. Returning to her native state, she took up and completed a course in music in the Illinois Wesleyan University, and was an accomplished musician. She espoused with enthusiasm the work of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific circle and completed a four years‘ course in that university, graduating in the class of 1886. Career She was from her childhood an earnest Christian, and like thousands of other Christian young women, was captivated by Frances Willard. For several years she was National Superintendent of the Flower Mission Department of the WCTU, which was founded by Jennie Casseday. Under Byerly's influence, it became a great evangelistic agency. Unnumbered gifts of flowers with appropriate scripture texts attached, were distributed in prisons, hospitals and sick- chambers. While engaged in this work, she became interested in visiting the sick in hospitals and strangers far from home, always leaving a bunch of flowers, with a Scripture text attached, and learned to love the work so much that she continued it with enthusiasm as long as she lived. In 1887, she moved with her parents to Colton, California, and spent eleven years there where her work was enlarged. The great number of consumptives who sought that climate often only to die far from home and among strangers greatly aroused her sympathies; and she went about with her fruits and flowers and cheering words among the victims of tuberculosis till her friends remonstrated lest she contract the disease herself. But it had become a passion with her and as long as she remained in California she continued these ministrations. Her father and mother both died in California and the family home among the orange trees was broken up. Returning to Illinois shortly thereafter, she resigned from her position as National Superintendent of the Flower Mission Department in 1898. She married Rev. Alexander Clay Byerly in Springfield, Illinois May 15, 1900. It was his second marriage and he brought three small children with him into this union. She at once transferred her membership to the Methodist Episcopal Church, where, with such intelligence and consecration as she possessed, she could not fail to be a helpmate in the ministry. In the church at Lincoln, Illinois where her husband was pastor at the time of her marriage, she was greatly beloved. She was an inspiration to the young people of the Epworth League. Under her direction, the methods of the Flower Mission were applied in the Department of Mercy and Help with the most blessed spiritual results. She threw her whole soul into the work of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society. She corresponded with many of the missionaries and always had something fresh from the field to talk about in the home and to present in the meetings. Death In 1903, she developed a severe sickness from which she never fully recovered. A long siege of the grippe in the early part of the 1903-04 winter left her much debilitated. and it seemed impossible for her to recuperate in the rigorous climate of Illinois. So it was decided that she should go to Citronelle, Alabama for a few weeks. For about ten days after arrival there, she seemed rapidly recuperating. She wrote cheerful letters home telling of her progress. but the suddenly became prostrated with a severe bilious attack (severe indigestion). Various complications developed and she grew alarmingly worse until she died on February 19, 1904. The body was brought to the home in Springfield, and the funeral conducted in First Church. The remains were cremated in accordance with the wish of the deceased, and taken to Riverside, California, and interred in the family lot in Olivewood Memorial Park.

They are native and endemic to Australia. Species of Bayardella, like other Planorbids, are non-operculate.  Description  The aperture (shell mouth) is typically almost as long as the entire shell with some specimens being described as 'almost abalone-shaped'. The species of Bayardella, when adult, often display medium-sized shells that are usually 5-9mm in size. The shells often display heavy spiral ridges on the periostricum, have a deep umbilicus and have a margin to the columellar that is reflected and curved slightly but without a fold. The shells of Bayardella, like other Planorbids, are typically sinistral.  Ecology  Bayardella can be found living on the underside of stones and pieces of wood (i.e. fallen logs or branches) in the upper reaches of small streams and waterholes. Bayardella cf. johni has also been observed living in the lower freshwater reaches of the Ross River, Townsville, Queensland. Due to the ephemeral nature of many of Bayardella's habitats, Bayardella are able to aestivate on the underside of hard surfaces such as rocks and large pieces of wood.  Distribution  Bayardella are endemic to the Australian mainland. Bayardella are found in Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. However, Bayardella are only found in large populations on rare occasion in the Northern Territory. Elsewhere, they are found in small, often ephemeral populations.

The roles of women in Taoism (, ) (also spelled \\"Daoism\\" ) have differed from the traditional patriarchy over women in ancient and imperial China. Chinese women had special importance in some Taoist schools that recognized their transcendental abilities to communicate with deities, who frequently granted women with revealed texts and scriptures. Women first came to prominence in the Highest Clarity School, which was founded in the 4th century by a woman, Wei Huacun. The Tang dynasty (618-907) was a highpoint for the importance of Daoist women, when one-third of the Shangqing clergy were women, including many aristocratic Daoist nuns. The number of Daoist women decreased until the 12th century when the Complete Perfection School, which ordained Sun Bu'er as the only woman among its original disciples, put women in positions of power. In the 18th and 19th centuries, women Daoists practiced and discussed nüdan (女丹, \\"women's neidan inner alchemy\\"), involving gender-specific practices of breath meditation and visualization. Furthermore, Daoist divinities and cults have long traditions in China, for example, the Queen Mother of the West, the patron of xian immortality, He Xiangu, one of the Eight Immortals, and Mazu, the protectress of sailors and fishermen. Terminology Since organized Daoism began in the late Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE), women have been active in different schools, which gave them diverse names. In the Tianshi dao (Way of the Celestial Masters), they were called nüshi (女士 or 女師, \\"female masters\\") when married to a Master, or nüguan (女官, \\"female officers\\") when among chosen zhongmin (種民, \\"seed people\\"). In the Shangqing (Highest Clarity) School, Daoist nuns were most often solitary practitioners, and called nü daoshi (女道士, \\"female Daoists\\" or \\"female Daoist masters\\") or nüguan (女冠, \\"female hats\\", describing a distinctive ritual headdress) in the Song dynasty. The Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) School uses daogu (道姑, \\"ladies of the Dao\\") in reference to both convent nuns and devout laity (Despeux 2000: 384, 2008: 171). History Queen Mother of the West illustration in the Shanhaijing, Qing dynasty edition. Queen Mother of the West, Han dynasty earthenware, 2nd century CE =Pre-Han and Han= Xiwang mu, the Queen Mother of the West, is the most prominent female Daoist divinity, although her traditions predated organized Daoist religions (Despeux 2008: 172). Sources from the Warring States period (475-221 BCE) associate the Queen Mother with shamanistic traditions, such as her familiar the three-legged crow, and her peaches of immortality orchard (Despeux 2000: 386). The c. 3rd century BCE Shanhaijing (Classic of Mountains and Seas) says, \\"In appearance, Queen Mother of the West looks like a human, but she has a leopard's tail and the fangs of a tigress, and she is good at whistling. She wears a victory crown on her tangled hair. She presides over the Catastrophes from the Sky and the Five destructive Forces.\\" (tr. Birrell 2000: 24) During the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), people believed that the Queen Mother could protect them from disease and death, and she became the central figure worshiped by a peasant cult that arose in Shandong and swept through the country in 3 BCE (Despeux and Kohn 2003: 27). Xiwang mu became known as the goddess of epidemics who resided in the west on Kunlun Mountain and ruled over the demons of pestilence. Her cults worshiped the Queen in different regions of China, especially Mount Heng in Hunan, Mount Hua in Shaanxi, and Mount Wuyi in Fujian. Under the Six Dynasties, the Queen mother's cult was integrated into the pantheon of Shangqing (Highest Clarity) Daoism and she became one of the school's key goddesses, helping both sexes at this time. Her worship peaked during the Tang period, when she emerged particularly as the protectress of women, and was revered as the representative of the female ideal (Cahill 1993). Since the Song dynasty, Xiwang mu's cult in official Daoism has been increasingly supplanted by that of other goddesses. She has nevertheless continued to be a major figure in sectarian movements and small congregational groups who received messages from her through fuji spirit writing. Descending onto the altar during séances, under the Ming and Qing she took on the title Wusheng Laomu (無生老母, Unborn Venerable Mother), and still remains a key goddess worshiped by women, especially in popular settings (Despeux 2000: 387). =Early Middle Ages= Women began to become important in organized Daoism during the Three Kingdoms and Six Dynasties (221–590) and Sui dynasty (590–618) periods. In the 4th century the Shangqing School recognized a woman, Wei Huacun (251-334), as the school's founder. Women in this Daoist school transmitted scriptures, taught methods, and served as initiators (Despeux 2008: 171). Married to a leading Tianshi officer, Wei Huacun became a respected jijiu (祭酒, libationer), which means that she received a thorough religious education in the organization, including sexual rites of passage and the reception of official registers (Despeux 2000: 388). Her hagiography says that she attained the Dao on Mount Heng, which at the time was a highly active center of both Buddhist and Daoist practices (Faure 1987). She was accordingly called Nanyue furen (南嶽夫人, Lady of the Southern Marchmount). After this time, she became the object of an important cult which, especially under the Tang (Schafer 1977) became prominent among women Daoists and spread throughout China (Strickmann 1979: 142). According to a Six Dynasties' text, the Tianshi School distinguished five different types of women suited to become Daoist practitioners: young unmarried girls, women unable to marry due to an inauspicious horoscope, women forced into marriage, widows, and rejected wives (Overmyer 1991: 99-101). These were all undesirable classes, rejected by society, to which Tianshi offered a form of escape and an alternative. Such a status allowed these women to have at least some role and not be excluded completely. The same pattern also held true for other Daoist schools and periods, especially during the Tang dynasty (Despeux 2000: 385). =Tang= Spring Excursion of Emperor Xuanzong's Court, by Zhang Xuan (713–755) The status of women in Daoism reached a peak during the Tang dynasty (618–907), particularly in the 8th century, when women formed one-third of the clergy (Despeux 2008: 171). Under the auspices of the Shangqing School, which dominated organized Daoism under the Tang, women reached their most prominent religious positions as initiators, preceptors, and possessors of sacred texts and methods. This was actively supported by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712-56), whose \\"passions for women and Daoism extended to women Daoists\\". According to the official statistics, there were 1,687 Daoist temples in the 8th century: 1,137 for men and 550 for women. Women thus constituted an important part of the Daoist clergy as it was recognized officially (Despeux 2000: 388). The rise of aristocratic Daoist nuns during the Tang was an unprecedented development in Chinese society and history. More than ten imperial daughters became ordained Daoists and converted their residences into convents (Schafer 1985: 1). Separated from the Chinese social order through their religious conversion, the women could both maintain their political influence and avoid palace intrigues. They economically benefited from their new status, enjoying a remarkable degree of personal freedom for a Tang woman, often led a licentious life, traveled extensively, and devoted themselves to the arts (Despeux 2000: 388). Women would enter Daoist convents for differing reasons, such as girls purifying their lives before entering society or widows seeking a better life. Sometimes a woman would become a Daoist nun in order to escape an unwanted marriage or to change her husband. Princess Taiping, the youngest daughter of Emperor Gaozong (r. 649-683) and Empress Wu, entered a Daoist convent in 670 to escape a requested marriage of state with the king of \\"barbarian\\" Turpan (Despeux 2000: 389). Yang Guifei (Most Honorable Consort Yang), the beloved concubine of Emperor Xuanzong, was married to Li Mao, the emperor's eighteenth son, who she left by becoming a Daoist nun in 745, which then allowed her to enter Xuanzong's imperial harem (Schafer 1978). A celebrated example of noble Daoist nuns was the elaborate 711 ordination ceremony of two imperial princesses, Xining (西寧) and Changlong (昌隆), the eighth and ninth daughters of Emperor Ruizong of Tang (r. 684-90) and sisters of Emperor Xuanzong (Despeux 2008: 172). The Daoist ritualist Zhang Wanfu (張萬福) described the princesses' splendiferous 14-day ordination rite, and noted the widespread criticism from ministers and officials about the high costs (Benn 1991:148-151). The emperor also ordered the construction of two monasteries for his daughter nuns in Chang'an, nearby the imperial concubines (Despeux 2000: 388). Official Daoism incorporated several female-based cults during the Tang. While local cults had always flourished in the north and northwest of China, they predominantly began in the maritime and central regions of the east and south where divine women, including goddesses, shamanesses, and cultic founders, grew in stature and often became objects of pilgrimages undertaken equally by men and women (Schafer 1973). Daoist texts often described the integration of regional divinities into the official pantheon as conquests, and praised female Daoists for their exceptional powers as prophets, healers, and saviors (Despeux 2000: 390). The lesser-known Qingwei (清微, Pure Subtlety) school, a tradition that emphasized therapy and exorcism, incorporated a local cult founded by the Daoist priestess Zu Shu (祖舒, fl. 889-904) from Lingling (near present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) (Despeux 2008: 172). Unlike the well-documented biography of Wei Huacun, little is known about Zu. After receiving ordination in the traditions of Daoist Tianshi, Shangqing, and Lingbao schools, she went to Guiyang (present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) where she met Lingguang shengmu (靈光聖母, Holy Mother of Numinous Radiance), who transmitted to Zu Shu the Way of Pure Subtlety together with talismans and exorcism techniques, said to have been passed down from Yuanshi Tianzun (Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning) (Despeux 2000: 390). Later Qingwei followers placed Zu at the head of their \\"patriarchal\\" lineage, which Chen Cai (陳采) first constructed in the 13th-century Qingwei xianpu (清微仙普, Account of the Immortals of Pure Subtlety) (Boltz 1987: 38-39). According to Catherine Despeux, Zu Shu seems more like a southern shaman than a religious visionary. Rather than an active founder, she appears in the Pure Subtlety school mainly as a preceptor who transmitted methods that she learned from another woman (2000: 391). =Song= Woodblock illustration of He Xiangu Lushan school Temple of Heavenly Harmony in Luodong, Taiwan Wang Chongyang and his seven Quanzhen School masters, with Sun Bu'er in the middle of the back row In the early Song dynasty (960–1279) the number of women Daoists declined to about 3-5% of the registered clergy and only rose again later, with the emergence of the Quanzhen School in the late 12th century during the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). Nevertheless, cults of women continued to flourish and there were some senior female practitioners of various techniques (Despeux 2000: 391). Among the cults, in addition to the Queen Mother of the West, the Daoist pantheon includes other well-known female divinities. For instance, He Xiangu (Immortal Maiden He), one of the Eight Immortals, whose cult was established between the Tang and Song dynasties (Despeux 2008: 172). The cult of Linshui furen (臨水夫人, the Lady of the Water's Edge), or Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑, 767-791), became popular during the Song era. According to Daoist tradition, she was born with various supernatural abilities, but died young and pregnant during a rain-making ritual. Her powers began to manifest after her death and she gradually grew into the protectress of women, children, and jitong (乩童, boy mediums) (Despeux 2008: 172). The cult first developed in Chen's home state of Min (Fujian), and then was canonized in the Song as Linshui furen. Many practices of this women's movement were shamanistic, Linshui furen and her sisters were praised as magicians, controllers of demons, exorcists, and healers who could undertake shamanic travels into the afterlife. Linshui furen's cult grew and established her more formally as a divinity, and her fame spread more widely (Despeux 2000: 391). Later this Daoist cult became particularly prominent in Taiwan, where the Lady of the Water's Edge served as a focal point for communities of women who refused marriage but did not wish to become celibate, and instead preferred lesbian life (Berthier 1988). Among female Daoist practitioners, Cao Wenyi (曹文逸, fl. 1119-1125) was a renowned author who was posthumously honored as the first woman to practice neidan inner alchemy. Song bibliographies list her writings to include commentaries on various Daoist texts, including the Xishengjing (Scripture of Western Ascension) and Daodejing, and a long poem on neidan entitled Lingyuan dadao ge (靈源大道歌, Song of the Great Dao, the Numinous Source) (Despeux 2008: 172). It begins, \\"I am telling all you ladies straight: The stem of destiny grows from perfect breathing that irradiates the body and provides long life, whether empty or not empty, and brings forth the numinous mirror which contains Heaven and all beings.\\" (tr. Despeux and Kohn 2003: 137). Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100-1125) heard of Cao's fame, called her to the capital Kaifeng, and conferred the title Wenyi zhenren (文逸真人, Perfected One of Literary Withdrawal). In the Qing dynasty, Lady Cao supposedly appeared in spirit- writing séances and was venerated by several lineages of women's inner alchemy﹒ Some of her writings are preserved in the White Cloud Temple in Beijing, where the Daoist Qingjing (清靜, Purity and Tranquility) school honors her as their patroness (Despeux 2000: 391-392). While women were of lesser importance in Daoism through most of the Song, their position rose again with the growth of the Quanzhen School, in which they served as abbesses of major temples and leaders of local associations. The Quanzhen list of seven masters includes a woman, Sun Bu'er (1119-1183). She was born into a powerful local family in Ninghai in Shandong, received a literary education, and married Ma Yu (馬鈺, 1123-1183) who also became one of the seven masters (Cleary 1989). When the Quanzhen founder Wang Chongyang visited Ninghai in 1167, Ma Yu and Sun Bu'er became active disciples. She later became a senior leader, ordained as Qjngjing sanren (清靜散人, Serene Lady of Purity and Tranquility), with the right to teach and ordain other woman followers (Despeux 2000: 392). =Yuan, Ming, and Qing= Bixia yuanjun statue, bronze with traces of pigment, Ming dynasty 15th century Mazu's miraculous rescue of Emperor Huizong of Song's envoy Lu Yundi (路允迪) returning from Goryeo in 1123 While the cult of Sun Bu'er became increasingly important during the Yuan (1271–1368), Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties, the general prestige of Daoist women decreased. Under the Yuan dynasty, when the Mongols governed China, there were 20,000 registered Daoists, many of them women, and institutions run by and for women were established throughout the country (Despeux and Kohn 2003: 152). References to women in Daoism become less frequent in the late Yuan and early Ming periods, and hagiographies of women are rare. The image of women became more complex in Qing sectarianism, which witnessed a revival of the tendency to honor women as matriarchs (Despeux 2008: 172). The Qing rulers instituted the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism as the state religion, and forced Buddhists and Daoists to use the same institutions. Some Daoist subsects and local groups had lineages that go back to a woman founder. In addition, Qing authors wrote texts specifically dealing with inner alchemy for women (Despeux 2000: 393). Cults of female deities developed mainly in the southern and coastal regions of Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong. Cult sites in these provinces were centers of intense religious activity and pilgrimage sites that attracted both male and female devotees. Beginning in the Tang period, the growth and reputation of the cults depended on their recognition by official Daoist institutions, learned circles, and the imperial court (Despeux 2008: 172). The Daoist pantheon adopted several popular goddesses. One of them is the Buddhist goddess Marici, the personification of light and daughter of the creator god Brahma who rules destiny (Getty 1962: 132-134). In Daoism, she appears as Doumu (斗母, Mother of the Big Dipper) and protectress against violence and peril (Despeux 2000: 393). The cult of Bixia yuanjun (碧霞元君, Goddess of the Morning Clouds) began in the Song with the discovery of a statue on Mount Tai, and during the Ming she was venerated as the daughter of Dongyue dadi (東岳大帝, Great Deity of Mount Tai), and merciful helper of dead souls (Naquin 1992: 334-345). As documented in the Bixia yuanjun huguo baosheng jing (碧霞元君護國保生經, Scripture on the Guarding of Life and Protection of the Country through the Goddess of the Morning Clouds), she was officially integrated into the pantheon through formal empowerment by Yuanshi Tianzun (Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning), who reportedly gave her the necessary spells and talismans for helping people (Despeux 2000: 393). The water deity Mazu (Ancestral Mother) or Tianfei (天妃, Celestial Consort), the tutelary of seafarers and fishermen, is prominent among the emerging new Daoist goddesses, and parallels the Buddhist goddess of compassion Guanyin who similarly saves mariners. She is the deification of the shamaness Lin Moniang (林默娘, 960-987) a fisherman' s daughter from Meizhou Island off Fujian. Refusing to marry, she practiced self-cultivation until she was able to command nature in order to protect herself, and then used her powers to rescue her father and brothers whenever they were in danger of drowning. After an early death, her spirit powers increased and she became famous for safeguarding fishermen and traveling merchants (Despeux and Kohn 2003: 65). The Mazu cult began in Fujian at the end of the 10th century, and by the 13th had spread throughout the maritime coastal provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui (Despeux 2008: 172). In the present day, her cult has spread throughout Southeast Asia and overseas Chinese communities, with major Chinese sanctuaries in Tianjin and Quanzhou, 510 temples in Taiwan, and 40 in Hong Kong (Despeux 2000: 393-394). Texts Sources on women in Daoism include both collections of biographies of xian (\\"immortals; transcendents\\"), technically \\"hagiographies\\" insofar as xian are saints, and works by women authors, particularly about neidan inner alchemy. =Hagiographies= Daoist biographical compilations, dating back to the c. 2nd century CE Liexian zhuan and 4th century Shenxian zhuan, generally include hagiographies of both men and women, but there are two works dealing exclusively with the lives of women in Daoism (Despeux 2008: 173). The first text is the 913 Yongcheng jixian lu (墉城集仙錄, Records of the Immortals Gathered in the Walled City), compiled by the Daoist priest and author Du Guangting (850-933). Du's preface says the original text contained 109 hagiographies of Shangqing masters, but the received text exists in two partial versions, with 37 biographies in the canonical Daozang and 28 in the Yunji Qiqian anthology, only two of which are identical. Based on the extant fragments of the collection, the majority of Daoist women presented belonged to the Shangqing School during the Tang. In his preface Du Guangting emphasizes that, according to Shangqing teachings, the Primordial Father (Yuanfu 元父) and the Metal Mother Jinmu 金母) are in charge of entering the names of male and female adepts in the heavenly registers of immortality, which are overseen by Xiwangmu, protectress of the immortals of Yongcheng, the Heavenly Walled City on Mount Kunlun. This description does not imply any form of gender hierarchy or preference, but rather shows a complementarity between the two, echoing earlier periods when worship of the Queen Mother was dominant among popular cults (Despeux 2000: 394-395). The 3rd-century Bowuzhi (Record of Ample Things) quotes Laozi that, \\"all people are under the care of the Queen Mother of the West. Only the destinies of kings, sages, men of enlightenment, immortals and men of Dao are cared for by the Lord of the Nine Heavens.\\" (tr. Greatrex 1987: 78). The second is the Houji 後集 (Later Compilation) portion of Lishi zhenxian tidao tongjian (歷世真仙體道通鋻, Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals and Those Who Embodied the Dao through the Ages), compiled by the Yuan hagiographer Zhao Daoyi (趙道一, fl. 1294-1307) of the Quanzhen school. The text contains 120 biographies, including many found in the Yongcheng jixian lu, and combines mythic Daoist deities, such as Laozi's mother Wushang yuanjun (無上元君, All-Highest Goddess), Doumu, and Xiwangmu, with real women, including fourteen biographies of Song women (Despeux 2000: 394-395). =Works written by women= Emperor Xuanzong's younger sister Yuzhen gongzhu (玉真公主, Princess of Jade Perfection) who became a Daoist nun wrote two texts, both dated 738: the Qionggong wudi neisi shangfa (瓊宮五帝內思上法, Highest Methods of Visualizing the Five Emperors of the Jasper Palace) and Lingfei liujia neisi tongling shangfa (靈飛六甲內思通靈上法, Highest Methods of Visualizing the Flying Spirits of the Six Jia to Communicate with the Divine). Both describe meditation methods used in the Shangqing school, and her calligraphy was preserved in a Tang calligraphic collection by Zhong Shaojing. The 848 Huangting neijing wuzang liufu buxie tu (黃庭內景五臟六腑補瀉圖, Illustrated Description of the Tonification or Dispersion of the Five Organs and Six Viscera According to the Yellow Court Scripture) was written by the Tang Daoist physiologist Hu Jin (胡惜), said to have been taught by the mythological Sunü (素女, Immaculate Girl) on Mount Taibai in Shaanxi. This text contains a discussion of the central organs in the human body, and lists neidan therapies for internal ailments, including drugs, energy absorptions, dietary restrictions, and gymnastic exercises. They correspond with the meditational techniques from the c. 4th-century Yellow Court Classic that were popular during the Tang (Despeux 2000: 396). The illustrations have been long lost, but the book is \\"full of therapy and pharmacy, throwing valuable light on the borderline between medicine and Taoist physiological alchemy\\" (Needham and Lu 1983: 82). Cao Wenyi's 12th-century Lingyuan dadao ge (靈源大道歌, Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source) is also attributed to He Xiangu, the only female of the Eight Immortals. This lengthy Chan Buddhism- influenced poem does not specifically mention anything female, but Qing Daoists associated its author with women's inner alchemical practices, and the text was accordingly included into collections on the subject (Despeux 2000: 396). =Works on women's inner alchemy= A corpus of Daoist literature concerning nüdan (女丹, women's [inner] alchemy), or kundao (坤道, \\"the female way\\", with kun \\"female; 8th of the 8 trigrams, ☷), comprises about thirty documents of unequal length, dating from 1743 to 1892. These texts are generally attributed to both male and female divinities and said to have been transmitted through spirit-writing (Despeux 2008: 173). The few earlier sources that specifically mentioned neidan practices for women were typically in terms of yin and yang correlations. Since yin is associated with women and left while yang with men and right, the breath supposedly turns toward the left in men and toward the right in women (Despeux 2000: 406). The 1834 Gu Shuyinlou cangshu (古書隱樓藏書, Collection of the Ancient Hidden Pavilion of Books), edited by Min Yide (閔一得), contains two consecutive works about women's internal alchemy. First, the Xiwang mu nüxiu zhengtu shize (西王母女修正途十則, Ten Principles of the Queen Mother of the West on the Correct Path of Female Cultivation, tr. Wile 1992: 193-201) was revealed in 1795 by Sun Bu'er to Li Niwan (李泥丸). The original title was Nü jindan jue (女金丹訣, Women's Formula of the Golden Elixir). The text shows some Tantric Buddhist influence, and presents ten rules specifically for women's practice, including techniques on how to intercept menstruation, breast massages, visualization of qi meridians in the body, and breath meditation exercises (Despeux 2000: 397; 2008: 173). Second, the Niwan Li zushi nüzong shuangxiu baofa (泥丸李祖師女宗雙修寶筏, Precious Raft of Women's Double Cultivation According to Master Li Niwan), subtitled Nügong zhinan (女功指南, A Compass of Women's Practice), was also revealed to Li in 1795. The text explains nine rules for the progressive transformation of the adept's body, including calming and purifying the spirit, increasing energy circulation through breast massages, eventually leading to the accumulation of wisdom, and formation of a new spiritual \\"body of light\\" within the adept's body (Despeux 2000: 397-398). He Longxiang's (賀龍驤) Nüdan hebian (女丹合編, Collected Works on Inner Alchemy for Women) was included in the 1906 edition Daozang jiyao (道藏輯要, Essentials of the Daoist Canon). His preface notes that he spent thirty years collecting and compiling the collection, based on the practices undertaken by the Daoist women in his family. The materials consist of about twenty prose and poetry texts that outline the various major stages of the inner alchemical path, precisely describe the energy meridians, and make clear distinctions between men's and women's practices (Despeux 2000: 398). The Nü jindan fayao (女金丹法要, Essential Methods of Women's Golden Elixir), by Fu Jinquan (傅金銓, 1765-1844), mostly consists of poems and prose texts revealed by Sun Bu'er through planchette writing. The author emphasizes the importance of cultivating companionship with others and the necessity of performing virtuous acts. Women adepts are supposed to purify their karma, repent their sins, and cultivate goodness, sincerity, filial piety, and proper wifely devotion (Despeux 2000: 398). Fu Jinquan also compiled nüdan texts in the early 19th century collection Daoshu shiqi zhong (道書十七種, Seventeen Books on the Dao) (Despeux 2008: 173). The Nüzi daojiao congshu (女子道教叢書, Collection of Daoist Writings for Women), compiled by Yi Xinying (易心瑩, 1896-1976), contains eleven texts, describing women's liturgy, women's Daoist lineages, the principles of body transmutation, interception of menses, and interior cultivation (Despeux 2000: 398). Practices=Women's inner alchemy= Woodblock illustration of a female adept practicing neidan \\"Nourishing and growing the sacred embryo\\", 1615 Xingming guizhi (性命圭旨, Pointers on Spiritual Nature and Bodily Life) Writings on inner alchemy for women emphasize the shengtai (聖胎, \\"Sacred Embryo; Immortal Embryo\\") of sainthood. The process has three stages transforming the Three Treasures of jing (精, \\"essence; semen; menstrual fluid\\"), qi (氣, \\"vitality; energy; breath\\"), and shen (神, \\"spirit; deity; supernatural being\\"). First, refining the jing essence and transforming it into qi energy; second, refining the energy and transforming it into shen spirit; and third, refining the spirit to return to (xu 虛) emptiness. In the first stage, the adept transforms the various yin and yang forces within the body into an embryo of energy. During the second stage and in the course of ten symbolic months, this embryo gives birth to the yuanshen (元神, original spirit force). This birth takes place through the fontanelle, because the alchemical process inverts the course of natural procedures. This luminous spirit leaves and re-enters the body, and then is further sublimated in the third stage to eventually merge back completely into cosmic emptiness (Despeux 2000: 406). Only the first stage differentiates practices between men and women. In neidan terminology, semen is called baihu (白虎, White Tiger) and menstrual blood is chilong (赤龍, Red Dragon). Instead of refining seminal essence and transforming it into energy, women refine their menstrual blood by progressively diminishing their flow and eventually stopping it altogether. This is known as duan chilong (斷赤龍, \\"cutting off the Red Dragon\\") or zhan chilong (斬赤龍, \\"decapitating the Red Dragon\\"), and identifies the adept as pregnant with an embryo of pure energy. Menstrual blood is sublimated into a \\"new blood\\" called the baifeng sui (白鳳髓, \\"white marrow of the phoenix\\"), which is refined into a higher level of spiritual power (Despeux 2000: 406-407). In traditional Chinese medicine, menstrual blood and seminal fluid represent the fundamental energies of women and men. The cessation of the menstrual flow in women structurally corresponds with the retention of the semen in men. In both cases, loss of an essential substance is stopped and with it, the loss of original energy. This cessation creates a reversal of the natural processes and allows the symbolic creation of a new internal sprout of energy that turns into an embryo of energy. According to traditional medical literature, menstrual blood is formed from maternal milk, which two days before menstruation, sinks down from the breasts into the uterus where it transforms into blood. The refinement of menstrual blood into energy is therefore a reversal of the natural process and consists of its returning to milky secretions. The process begins with breast massages to stimulate the internal fire of sexual desire, which is then controlled to nurture the inner being. Furthermore, the female adept uses breath meditation to transform menstrual blood back into breast secretions. A warm energy is felt rotating around her navel, the area heats up, and the \\"red is transformed into the white\\". According to the Nü jindan, \\"When yang is close to being transformed into yin and to flow out through the jade channel [vagina], quickly get on the wheel of fire. When the wind of the Xun blows in the upper part, in the original Scarlet Palace [solar plexus], decapitate the periodic flow of blood so that it can never run again!\\" (Despeux 2000: 407). Texts on neidan practices affirm that since the internal movement of energies corresponds to the gestational capabilities already present in women, their spiritual progress with inner alchemy is consequently faster than that of men. While a male adept has to develop a womb inside himself and learn how to nurture an embryo in it, a woman already has this natural faculty and thus has an easier time learning the practice. He Lοngxiang's preface says, \\"In the case of women, we discuss breathing techniques but not embryonic practices\\" (Despeux 2000: 402). =Mediumistic activities= Chu culture, c. 3rd century BCE Women played an important role in the long tradition of Chinese shamanism. The word wu (, \\"spirit medium; shaman; sorcerer; doctor\\") was first recorded during the Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 BCE) when a wu could be either male or female. During the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE) wu specifically meant \\"female shaman; sorceress\\" as opposed to xi (, \\"male shaman; sorcerer\\"). Later names for shamanesses include nüwu (女巫, \\"woman shaman\\"), wunü (巫女, \\"shaman woman\\"), wupo (巫婆, \\"shaman old woman\\"), and wuyu (巫嫗, \\"shaman hag\\"). Shamans communicated with the divine world, serving as diviners, diagnosticians, healers, exorcists, and zhaohun summoners of souls (Hawkes 1985). Early Daoist movements assimilated popular shamanistic practices, especially revealed texts and automatic writing, and yet also criticized shamans for heterodox worship and black magic (Despeux 2000: 403). Many Daoist texts were thought to have been revealed to mediums and shamans in states of spirit possession. An early example is the c. 2nd-century CE Taipingjing (Scripture of Great Peace) that describes itself as a tianshu (天書, \\"celestial book\\") (Overmyer and Jordan 1986: 37). The Zhen'gao, which was allegedly revealed to the mystic Yang Xi in the 4th century, has strong shamanistic overtones. For instance, \\"If perfected and divine spirits descend into an impure person of the world, they are no longer acting or writing with their own feet and hands. As above and below are so far distant from each other, how can their traces [writings] be truly visible [to humans]?\\" (Despeux 2000: 403). Mediumistic literature enthralled Chinese literati, and the Song authors Shen Kuo and Su Dongpo both described spirit-writing practices, especially those associated with the cult of the Zigu (紫姑, Purple Lady), the Toilet God. In the Tang period, she was the second wife of a man whose jealous first wife brutally mutilated her, and slowly burned her to death in the toilet. Since Zigu died on the fifteenth of the first lunar month, that became her feast day, when she would descend into entranced women followers and answer their questions (Maspero 1981: 135-137). She was venerated as the protectress of women, and even the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1522-1566) had a special altar to Zigu. Women had privileged positions in mediumistic circles and Daoism. Shamanic elements underlie traditions of both schools with female lineages and women's inner alchemical texts. When organized Daoism adapted the ancient practices of shamanesses, women Daoists took on important new roles and functions (Despeux 2000: 403-404). =Sexual practices= The Daoist spectrum of sexual activities ranged widely across schools, some stressed strict celibacy, others mystically married celestial partners, and still others practiced communal ritual intercourse (Despeux 2008: 173). In the early Tianshi movement, all community members were initiated into a religious life of strict moral control and ritual sex. Women in the movement played key organizational roles and were essential in the guodu (過度, \\"rites of passage\\") sexual initiation, which went back to ancient fangzhong shu (房中術, \\"bedchamber arts\\") longevity techniques, and to shamans' ecstatic unions with the divine (Wile 1992). Best known is the sexual ritual of heqi (合氣, \\"harmonizing the energies\\"), during which community members, regardless of their marital affiliations, joined in formal intercourse. The rites took place in the oratorγ or jingshi (靜室, \\"chamber of tranquility\\") in the presence of a master and an instructor. The techniques involved visualization of bodily energies and ritualized body movements aligned with Chinese numerology and astrology. In contrast to the sensual bedchamber arts, the ritual sex of Tianshi adepts was believed to result in formation of the Immortal Embryo, which benefits themselves as well as contributed to greater universal harmony (Despeux 2000: 404). Daoxuan's 644 Guang hongming ji (廣弘明集, Expanded Collection on the Propagation and Clarification [of Buddhism]) says, \\"During the rituals held at new and full moon, Daoists attend on their preceptor in their private chambers. Feeling and intention are made akin, and men and women engage in joining together. They match their four eyes and two noses, above and below. They join their two mouths and two tongues, one with the other. Once then yin and yang have met intimately, essence and energy are exchanged freely. Thus, the rites of men and women are performed and the Dao of male and female is harmonized.\\" (tr. Despeux and Kohn 2003: 106). The Shangqing Clarity tradition takes an ambivalent position toward sexual practices, while not completely rejected, sexuality is considered a lesser technique unable to grant advanced levels of spiritual realization. This Daoist school contends, along with some other religions of the world, that an adept must practice sexual abstinence and chastity in order to see and hear deities. Although the basic theme of sexual union is preserved, it is transposed into imaginary interactions with the divine (Despeux 2000: 405). As the Zhen'gao says: \\"When a perfected appears as a presence of light and one engages with him or her, then this is union with the light, love between two beings of light. Although they are then called husband and wife, they do not engage in marital relations\\" (tr. Despeux 2000: 399). Shangqing adepts sought to transcend mundane sexual union and move into the invisible realm, through the mediation of celestial partners and divine marriages (Cahill 1992). Daoist schools of neidan inner alchemy have two basic views on women and sexual union. First, retaining the semen during intercourse creates psycho- physiological transformations, which benefit both female and male adepts as equal partners. Second, practicing sexual abstinence emphasizes women's mediumistic abilities and results in autoeroticism, such as massaging her breasts. In both cases, the union's goal is the formation of an Immortal Embryo, the first sprout of the adept's spiritual rebirth (Despeux 2000: 405). Daoist literature describes the ideal sexual union as an even exchange of energies between partners, but some non-Daoist literature mentions a sort of \\"sexual vampirism\\" in which one partner selfishly tries to obtain energies at the other's expense. This practice, called caizhan (採戰, \\"plucking [of energy] in [amorous] combat\\"), usually benefited men but sometimes also women. For instance, the Queen Mother of the West attained Daoist immortality by nurturing her yin essence. Legends say that she never had a husband, but liked to copulate with young boys (Wile 1992: 102-103). Daoism consistently described such practices as improper and heterodox, even though they were covertly practiced within certain Daoist sects (Despeux 2000: 405). =Celibate and monastic life= Women Daoists who chose to become nuns typically lived in temples known as guan (觀) that began in the 5th to 6th centuries. Celibacy was associated with early Daoist schools. The reformer Kou Qianzhi (365-448), who probably influenced by the Buddhist model, established celibacy among the Northern Celestial Masters (Despeux 2000: 399). Similarly, the Shangqing School emphasized that chastity was necessary for an adept to visualize deities. Although the Shangqing founder Tao Hongjing (456-536) was celibate, the Maoshan institutions that he directed provided housing for adepts of both sexes and their children (Strickmann 1978: 471). Daoism has a long history of polemics over sexual abstinence. Some, such as Song Wenming (宋文明) of the early 6th century strongly recommended that all Daoists be celibate; others preferred family life, such as Li Bo (季播) who presented a memorial to the emperor in the early 7th century recommending that he not prohibit Daoist clergy from marrying (Maspero 1981: 411, 425). Woodblock illustration of Yu Xuanji, 1772 Lichao mingyuan shici (歷朝名媛詩詞) As mentioned above, Daoist temples during the Tang period segregated women's and men's institutions. Promiscuity was prevalent in some Tang monasteries, for example, the Xianyi guan (咸宜觀, Abbey of Universal Benefit) in Chang'an. It was named after Princess Xianyi, the twenty-second daughter of Emperor Xuanzong, who became a Daoist nun and entered the abbey in 762. Many widows from wealthy families became Xianyi nuns, and continued living in luxury, aided by their servants. The nuns mingled with women from many social classes, such as the celebrated courtesan and poet Yu Xuanji (c. 844-869), who was born into a poor family and married a Tang official as his second wife. After denunciation by his first wife, she joined the abbey, took the poet Wen Tingyun (812-870) as her lover, and became renowned as a leader in Tang poetry (Despeux 2000: 400). Sex segregation in Daoist institutions became stricter under the Song. In 927, Emperor Taizu issued the following edict: \\"There are decadent tendencies in the temples, including wearing rough fabric and cohabitation with women and children. This is prohibited for all Daoists. Those with family must live outside of the temple compound. From now on it shall be illegal to install someone as a Daoist without proper official authority.\\" (tr. Despeux 2000: 400). When the Quanzhen school spread throughout north China, they established many guan especially for women, and supported those who had lost family support. Monastic life in Quanzhen temples for both sexes was strictly regulated, and the daily schedule included periods for chanting classics, community work, and individual practices, including inner alchemical exercises (Despeux 2000: 401).

The murder was announced a day in advance in major newspapers, a crowd of as many as 10,000 watched while Hartfield was hanged, shot, and burned. Pieces of his corpse were chopped off and sold as souvenirs. History John Hartfield left his home in Ellisville seeking a better life in East St. Louis. In 1919, he traveled back to Ellisville to visit his white girlfriend, Ruth Meeks, taking a job as a hotel porter in Laurel. When the relationship became known to some white men, they determined to kill Hartfield. They accused Hartfield of raping Meeks, who they claimed was 18, although she was actually in her mid-twenties. Hartfield managed to elude them for a while, but they pursued him for several weeks. Sheriff Allen Boutwell in Laurel raised donations to fund a hunting party with bloodhounds at the request of Sheriff Harbison. He was finally apprehended attempting to board a train on June 24, and was turned over to Sheriff Harbison, who placed him in the charge of a deputy and left town. The deputy immediately released him to a mob. The Jackson Daily News, the New Orleans States, and other newspapers ran headlines that \\"John Hartfield will be lynched by Ellisville mob at 5:00 this afternoon\\" and additional text that \\"The officers have agreed to turn him over to the people of the city at 4 o'clock this afternoon when it is expected he will be burned\\". Hartfield had been wounded, so a white doctor, A. J. Carter, treated his wounds to keep him alive long enough to be murdered. At 5:00 PM on June 26, 1919, a large cheering crowd assembled to watch the premeditated murder of John Hartfield. Theodore Bilbo, the governor of Mississippi, took no action. Hartfield was hung in a tall sweet gum tree, then his body was riddled with bullets, then brought to the ground where men cut up the corpse for souvenirs, finally burning what remained. Afterward, commemorative postcards of the lynching were created and sent out. A story circulated among whites that Hartfield had been hanged from the very same tree where the confederates had hanged three insurgents in the civil war. Governor Bilbo declared \\"This is a white man's country, with a white man's civilization and any dream on the part of the Negro race to share social and political equality will be shattered in the end\\". Days later, a black man in Perry County was murdered by a mob because he mentioned Hartfield's death. In the 1920s, Ho Chi Minh cited the treatment of Hartsfield in his Selected Works.

The Arba Turim is one of the sources that Rabbi Joseph Karo used to write the Shulchan Aruch, the code of the Jewish law (the halacha), a book accepted and studied worldwide by the majority of orthodox Jews.

Its shape and structure conjures up a resemblance to a gothic cathedral that has inspired many artists, including Group of Seven's Arthur Lismer, to paint it back in 1928. This picturesque mountain is visible from Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway near Kicking Horse Pass. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Stephen, to the west. To prevent damage to its operations, CP Rail pumps overflow from Teacup Lake down the west face of Cathedral in order to minimize the subglacial lake's discharging in a phenomenon known as a jökulhlaup. History The name Cathedral Mountain was in use as early as 1884 and appeared on George Dawson's 1886 map. The first ascent of Cathedral Mountain was made in 1901 by James Outram, with guides Joseph Bossoney, and Christian Klucker. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Cathedral Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Cathedral Mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from Cathedral Mountain drains into tributaries of the Kicking Horse River which is a tributary of the Columbia River. Cathedral Crags Cathedral Crags (3082 m) are striking pinnacles with steep, reddish cliffs located one kilometre northwest of the summit of Cathedral Mountain, near Kicking Horse Pass and the Spiral Tunnels Viewpoint. This rocky feature of Cathedral Mountain was first climbed in 1900 by James Outram, and W. Outram, with Christian Hasler Sr. as guide. The crag's name was officially adopted in 1952 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.

Alec Scott, writing in The Globe and Mail, faulted the book for not explaining the kinship between fantasy and science-fiction genres, and for its inclusion of \\"schlock\\" along with truly literary works.

He hosted a local children's show from 1967 to 1987. Willie Whistle, a seagoing clown, was played by Dick Beach. Beach created the character of Salty the Clown as a fill-in for a local Toledo, Ohio show, Fun Farm. In 1960, he was given his own show, The Adventures of Salty and Friends. The Salty character featured a tiny whistle sitting on Beach's tongue that changed his voice to a high-pitched squeak. He performed skits with another character, Captain Cotton, and introduced cartoons. Beach was recruited by Boston's new UHF channel, WSBK-TV (UHF channel 38) to host a show there, starting in 1967. He kept the Salty character, but was required to rename it, since Salty was the nickname of a recent Massachusetts senator (Leverett Saltonstall). The name Willie Whistle was chosen. Beach was also promotions director at the station. Beach's character thrived in the larger Boston market, despite his speech being largely unintelligible such that he was provided with an off-screen interpreter. The Willie Whistle character continued on the air in Boston for twenty years, until 1987, when Beach retired for health reasons. Beach died on December 18, 2018, at the age of 90.https://www.kystandard.com/content/beloved-community-member-tv-past-dies ReferencesExternal links * American clowns 1967 American television series debuts 1987 American television series endings 1960s American children's television series 1970s American children's television series 1980s American children's television series Television shows about clowns Children's television characters Local children's television programming in the United States ","title":"Willie Whistle"},{"id":"59091702","text":"Long Road Home is a 1991 American TV film starring Mark Harmon.

Daly is an American economist, who became the 13th President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco on October 1, 2018. Accordingly, she serves on the Federal Reserve's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee on a rotating basis. Previously, Daly was the Executive Vice President and Director of Research of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which she joined as an economist in 1996. Her research is in the fields of macroeconomics and labor economics and focuses on labor force dynamics and on the impacts of monetary and fiscal policy. She has published influential work on wage, employment, and labor force dynamics, economic inequality, the economics of social security and disability, and evidence- based public policy. Daly has also worked to increase diversity and inclusion within the Federal Reserve System and in economics more broadly.  Education and early life Daly was born in Ballwin, Missouri. Her father was a postal worker and her mother was a homemaker. She said, \\"we were not poor, but we weren't very wealthy, either. And at some point my family just, sort of, imploded. And my siblings went to live with my grandparents and I went to live with friends. And I dropped out of high school.\\" At the time, she was 15 years of age. By age 16, she was living on her own, working at doughnut shops and retailer Target, struggling to scrape together a full-time salary. Daly went on to earn a general educational development (GED) and eventually a bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri-Kansas City in 1985. She later received a master's degree from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1987 and a Ph.D in economics from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University in 1994. She completed a post-doctoral fellowship at National Institute of Aging at Northwestern University in 1996. Career In 1996, Daly joined the San Francisco Fed as a research economist. She steadily rose through the ranks of the research department, becoming Executive Vice President and Director of Research in 2017. Her research has focused on labor market dynamics and the aggregate and distributional impacts of monetary and fiscal policy. She has published work on economic inequality, wage and unemployment dynamics, increasing output through workforce development, and disability and retirement policy. Daly considers Janet Yellen a mentor, stating that her career \\"just kind of exploded\\" after Yellen was named president of the San Francisco Fed in 2004 (Yellen went on to become the Fed's vice chair in 2010, and later its chair in 2014.) On October 1, 2018, Daly became the 13th President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, succeeding John C. Williams, who left in June 2018 to become the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. = Other = In May 2019, Daly served as the commencement speaker at the 165th commencement of Syracuse University.
