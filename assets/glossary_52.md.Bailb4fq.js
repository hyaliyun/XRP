They are a generalization of Puiseux series (themselves a generalization of formal power series) and were first introduced by Hans Hahn in 1907Hahn (1907) (and then further generalized by Anatoly Maltsev and Bernhard Neumann to a non-commutative setting). They allow for arbitrary exponents of the indeterminate so long as the set supporting them forms a well-ordered subset of the value group (typically mathbb{Q} or mathbb{R}). Hahn series were first introduced, as groups, in the course of the proof of the Hahn embedding theorem and then studied by him as fields in his approach to Hilbert's seventeenth problem. Formulation The field of Hahn series Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right] (in the indeterminate T) over a field K and with value group Œì (an ordered group) is the set of formal expressions of the form :f = sum_{einGamma} c_e T^e with c_e in K such that the support operatorname{supp} f:={ ein Gamma : c_e eq 0 } of f is well-ordered. The sum and product of :f = sum_{einGamma} c_e T^e and g = sum_{einGamma} d_e T^e are given by :f+g = sum_{einGamma} (c_e+d_e) T^e and :fg = sum_{einGamma} sum_{e'+e=e} c_{e'} d_{e} T^e (in the latter, the sum sum_{e'+e=e} cdot over values (e',e) such that c_{e'} eq 0 and d_{e} eq 0 is finite because a well- ordered set cannot contain an infinite decreasing sequence). For example, T^{-1/p} + T^{-1/p^2} + T^{-1/p^3} + cdots is a Hahn series (over any field) because the set of rationals :left{-frac{1}{p}, -frac{1}{p^2}, -frac{1}{p^3}, ldotsright} is well-ordered; it is not a Puiseux series because the denominators in the exponents are unbounded. (And if the base field K has characteristic p, then this Hahn series satisfies the equation X^p-X = T^{-1} so it is algebraic over K(T).) Properties= Properties of the valued field  The valuation v(f) of a non zero Hahn series :f = sum_{einGamma} c_e T^e is defined as the smallest e in Gamma such that c_e eq 0 (in other words, the smallest element of the support of f): this makes KT^Gamma into a spherically complete valued field with value group Gamma and residue field K (justifying a posteriori the terminology). In fact, if K has characteristic zero, then (KT^{Gamma},v) is up to (non unique) isomorphism the only spherically complete valued field with residue field K and value group GammaKaplansky, Irving, Maximal fields with valuation, Duke Mathematical Journal, vol. 1, n¬∞2, 1942.. The valuation v defines a topology on Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right]. If Gamma subseteq mathbb{R}, then v corresponds to an ultrametric absolute value f = exp(-v(f)), with respect to which Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right] is a complete metric space. However, unlike in the case of formal Laurent series or Puiseux series, the formal sums used in defining the elements of the field do not converge: in the case of T^{-1/p} + T^{-1/p^2} + T^{-1/p^3} + cdots for example, the absolute values of the terms tend to 1 (because their valuations tend to 0), so the series is not convergent (such series are sometimes known as \\"pseudo- convergent\\"Kaplansky (1942, Duke Math. J., definition on p.303)).  Algebraic properties  If K is algebraically closed (but not necessarily of characteristic zero) and Œì is divisible, then Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right] is algebraically closed.MacLane (1939, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., theorem 1 (p.889)) Thus, the algebraic closure of K((T)) is contained in overline{K}T^{mathbb{Q}}, where overline{K} is the algebraic closure of K (when K is of characteristic zero, it is exactly the field of Puiseux series): in fact, it is possible to give a somewhat analogous description of the algebraic closure of K((T)) in positive characteristic as a subset of Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right].Kedlaya (2001, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.) If K is an ordered field then Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right] is totally ordered by making the indeterminate T infinitesimal (greater than 0 but less than any positive element of K) or, equivalently, by using the lexicographic order on the coefficients of the series. If K is real-closed and Œì is divisible then Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right] is itself real closed.Alling (1987, ¬ß6.23, (2) (p.218)) This fact can be used to analyse (or even construct) the field of surreal numbers (which is isomorphic, as an ordered field, to the field of Hahn series with real coefficients and value group the surreal numbers themselvesAlling (1987, theorem of ¬ß6.55 (p. 246))). If Œ∫ is an infinite regular cardinal, one can consider the subset of Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right] consisting of series whose support set { ein Gamma : c_e eq 0 } has cardinality (strictly) less than Œ∫: it turns out that this is also a field, with much the same algebraic closedness properties as the full Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right]: e.g., it is algebraically closed or real closed when K is so and Œì is divisible.Alling (1987, ¬ß6.23, (3) and (4) (p.218‚Äì219))  Summable families = Summable families  One can define a notion of summable families in Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right]. If I is a set and (f_i)_{i in I} is a family of Hahn series f_i in Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right], then we say that (f_i)_{i in I} is summable if the set bigcup limits_{i in I} operatorname{supp} f_i subset Gamma is well-ordered, and each set {i in I    e in Gamma} for e in Gamma is finite. We may then define the sum sum limits_{i in I} f_i as the Hahn series sum limits_{i in I} f_i:=sum limits_{e in Gamma} (sum limits_{i in I} f_i(e)) T^e. If (f_i)_{i in I},(g_i)_{i in I} are summable, then so are the families (f_i+g_i)_{i in I},(f_i g_j)_{(i,j) in I times I}, and we haveJoris van der Hoeven sum limits_{i in I} f_i+g_i=sum limits_{i in I} f_i+sum limits_{i in I} g_i and sum limits_{(i,j) in I times I} f_i g_j=(sum limits_{i in I} f_i)(sum limits_{i in I} g_i). This notion of summable family does not correspond to the notion of convergence in the valuation topology on Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right]. For instance, in mathbb{Q}left[left[T^mathbb{Q}right]right], the family (T^{frac{n}{n+1}}+T^{n+1})_{n in mathbb{N}} is summable but the sequence (sum limits_{k leq n} T^{frac{k}{k+1}}+T^{k+1})_{n in mathbb{N}} does not converge.  Evaluating analytic functions  Let a in mathbb{R}< and let mathcal{A}_a denote the ring of real-valued functions which are analytic on a neighborhood of a. If K contains mathbb{R}, then we can evaluate every element f of mathcal{A}_a at every element of Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right] of the form a+varepsilon, where the valuation of varepsilon is strictly positive. Indeed, the family (frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}varepsilon^n)_{n in mathbb{N}} is always summableNeumann, so we can define f(a+varepsilon):=sum limits_{n in mathbb{N}} frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}varepsilon^n. This defines a ring morphism mathcal{A}_a longrightarrow Kleft[left[T^Gammaright]right].  Hahn‚ÄìWitt series  The construction of Hahn series can be combined with Witt vectors (at least over a perfect field) to form twisted Hahn series or Hahn‚ÄìWitt series:Kedlaya (2001, J. Number Theory) for example, over a finite field K of characteristic p (or their algebraic closure), the field of Hahn‚ÄìWitt series with value group Œì (containing the integers) would be the set of formal sums sum_{einGamma} c_e p^e where now c_e are Teichm√ºller representatives (of the elements of K) which are multiplied and added in the same way as in the case of ordinary Witt vectors (which is obtained when Œì is the group of integers). When Œì is the group of rationals or reals and K is the algebraic closure of the finite field with p elements, this construction gives a (ultra)metrically complete algebraically closed field containing the p-adics, hence a more or less explicit description of the field mathbb{C}_p or its spherical completion.Poonen (1993) Examples * The field K((T)) of formal Laurent series over K can be described as KT^mathbb Z. * The field of surreal numbers can be regarded as a field of Hahn series with real coefficients and value group the surreal numbers themselves.Alling (1987) * The Levi-Civita field can be regarded as a subfield of mathbb{R}T^mathbb{Q}, with the additional imposition that the coefficients be a left-finite set: the set of coefficients less than a given coefficient c_q is finite. * The field of transseries mathbb{T} is a directed union of Hahn fields (and is an extension of the Levi-Civita field). The construction of mathbb{T} resembles (but is not literally) T_0 = mathbb{R}, T_{n+1} = mathbb{R}left[left[varepsilon^{T_n}right]right].

The particularity of these was the Incaflex balance wheel, which was legendary at the time. The Wyler Incaflex balance wheel is protected along its diameter by two curved, elastic arms, which absorb any shocks to the balance wheel. In addition to producing his own calibres, Wyler also modified movements of other large-scale producers and sold these on to other watch companies. In some cases, the basic calibre was changed so much that the movements should actually be considered as Wyler calibres. In 1934, Wyler was the official watch of Italy's World Cup winning team. In 1937 the company caused a stir by launching a water-resistant watch that was not fitted with the conventional soft gaskets. The mineral glass was pressed in between the edge of the case and a pressed or screwed bezel, the gap between the winding shaft and the watch case was sealed hydraulically by fitting the winding shaft and bushing together, in the same material, to 1/500 mm. Wyler gained worldwide notoriety with a spectacular marketing stunt in 1956, when two watches were dropped from the top of the Eiffel Tower and continued to function after the fall.

First Report of Apium virus Y in Celery in New Zealand Plant Disease 91: 1682. In New Zealand, it was found in celery in a mixed infection with CeMV. In Washington state two different strains of ApVY were found, one in domestic celery crops and other in the weed poison hemlock. The one in celery was 98% identical to the Australian nucleotide sequences. The one found in naturally infected poison hemlock was only 91% identical to the sequences from Australia. The later turned out to be 98% identical to the North American isolates found in Florida and California. In turn, the Florida isolate was 90-91% identical to the Australian isolates. A third strain of this virus has been known in Germany since the early 1990s. Sequences of this virus isolated from parsley (Petroselinum crispum) were 94% identical to the Australian isolate from parsley. (H.-J Vetten, personal communication) Host range and symptoms In addition to cultivated celery and parsley and the weed poison hemlock, ApVY infections have been identified in sea celery (Apium prostratum), cilantro (Coriandrum sativum), and bishop‚Äôs weed (Ammi majus). In Germany it has recently been found naturally infecting celeriac or celery root. All are members of the plant family Apiaceae. Symptoms reported included mosaic, vein clearing or banding, necrotic/chlorotic line patterns and stunting. Some samples of parsley, celery and poison hemlock, that gave positive results in tests, however, were asymptomatic. In host range studies, the virus causes local lesions on Chenopodium quinoa and C. amaraticolor (Amaranthaceae).

Perhaps 14th century. An engraved gem, frequently referred to as an intaglio, is a small and usually semi-precious gemstone that has been carved, in the Western tradition normally with images or inscriptions only on one face.Fully half of the antique engraved gems in the Berlin museums and the British Museum are either sard or carnelian, Etta M. Saunders, noted. Saunders, \\"Goddess Riding a Goat-Bull Monster: A Ceres Zodiac Gem from the Walters Art Gallery\\" The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery 49/50 (1991/1992;7‚Äì11) note 19 The engraving of gemstones was a major luxury art form in the Ancient world, and an important one in some later periods.The three preeminent European collections of post-Classical engraved gems are the Cabinet des M√©dailles at the Biblioth√®que nationale, Paris, the Habsburg collection, Vienna, and the British Museum, London, O. M. Dalton observed in \\"Medi√¶val and Later Engraved Gems in the British Museum ‚Äî I\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 23 No. 123 (June 1913:128-136) and \\"II\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 24 No. 127 (October 1913:28‚Äì32). Strictly speaking, engraving means carving in intaglio (with the design cut into the flat background of the stone), but relief carvings (with the design projecting out of the background as in nearly all cameos) are also covered by the term. This article uses cameo in its strict sense, to denote a carving exploiting layers of differently coloured stone. The activity is also called gem carving and the artists gem-cutters. References to antique gems and intaglios in a jewellery context will almost always mean carved gems; when referring to monumental sculpture, counter-relief, meaning the same as intaglio, is more likely to be used. Vessels like the Cup of the Ptolemies and heads or figures carved in the round are also known as hardstone carvings. Glyptics or glyptic art covers the field of small carved stones, including cylinder seals and inscriptions, especially in an archaeological context. Though they were keenly collected in antiquity, most carved gems originally functioned as seals, often mounted in a ring; intaglio designs register most clearly when viewed by the recipient of a letter as an impression in hardened wax. A finely carved seal was practical, as it made forgery more difficult ‚Äì the distinctive personal signature did not really exist in antiquity. Technique Gems were mostly cut by using abrasive powder from harder stones in conjunction with a hand-drill, probably often set in a lathe. Emery has been mined for abrasive powder on Naxos since antiquity. Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by gem cutters in antiquity. A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from Theophilus Presbyter. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear where they learnt this technique from. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used.Kornbluth, 8-16 quotes passages from Theophilius and others, and discusses various techniques. See Theophilius's article for full on-line texts. The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity ‚Äì since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.Thoresen, \\"Gemstone enhancement\\" History Antelopes attacked by birds: cylinder seal in hematite and its impression. Late Bronze Age II (maybe 14th century BC), from Cyprus in the Minoan period, following Near Eastern precedents. The technique has an ancient tradition in the Near East, and is represented in all or most early cultures from the area, and the Indus Valley civilization. The cylinder seal, whose design only appears when rolled over damp clay, from which the flat ring type developed, was the usual form in Mesopotamia, Assyria and other cultures, and spread to the Minoan world, including parts of Greece and Cyprus. These were made in various types of stone, not all hardstone. The Greek tradition emerged in Ancient Greek art under Minoan influence on mainland Helladic culture, and reached an apogee of subtlety and refinement in the Hellenistic period. Pre- Hellenic Ancient Egyptian seals tend to have inscriptions in hieroglyphs rather than images. The Biblical Book of Exodus describes the form of the hoshen, a ceremonial breastplate worn by the High Priest, bearing twelve gems engraved with the names of the Twelve tribes of Israel. Round or oval Greek gems (along with similar objects in bone and ivory) are found from the 8th and 7th centuries BC, usually with animals in energetic geometric poses, often with a border marked by dots or a rim.Boardman, 39 See Beazley for more detail. Early examples are mostly in softer stones. Gems of the 6th century are more often oval,\\"Lenticular\\" or \\"lentoid\\" gems have the form of a lens. with a scarab back (in the past this type was called a \\"scarabaeus\\"), and human or divine figures as well as animals; the scarab form was apparently adopted from Phoenicia.Beazley, Later Archaic Greek gems: introduction. The forms are sophisticated for the period, despite the usually small size of the gems.Boardman, 68-69 In the 5th century gems became somewhat larger, but still only 2-3 centimetres tall. Despite this, very fine detail is shown, including the eyelashes on one male head, perhaps a portrait. Four gems signed by Dexamenos of Chios are the finest of the period, two showing herons.Boardman, 129-130 Reclining satyr, Etruscan c. 550 BC, 2.2 cm wide. Note the vase shown \\"sideways\\"; it is characteristic of early gems that not all elements in the design are read from the same direction of view. Relief carving became common in 5th century BC Greece, and gradually most of the spectacular carved gems in the Western tradition were in relief, although the Sassanian and other traditions remained faithful to the intaglio form. Generally a relief image is more impressive than an intaglio one; in the earlier form the recipient of a document saw this in the impressed sealing wax, while in the later reliefs it was the owner of the seal who kept it for himself, probably marking the emergence of gems meant to be collected or worn as jewellery pendants in necklaces and the like, rather than used as seals ‚Äì later ones are sometimes rather large to use to seal letters. However inscriptions are usually still in reverse (\\"mirror-writing\\") so they only read correctly on impressions (or by viewing from behind with transparent stones). This aspect also partly explains the collecting of impressions in plaster or wax from gems, which may be easier to appreciate than the original. The cameo, which is rare in intaglio form, seems to have reached Greece around the 3rd century; the Farnese Tazza is the only major surviving Hellenistic example (depending on the date assigned to the Gonzaga Cameo ‚Äì see below), but other glass-paste imitations with portraits suggest that gem-type cameos were made in this period.Boardman, 187-188 The conquests of Alexander the Great had opened up new trade routes to the Greek world and increased the range of gemstones available.Beazley, \\"Hellenistic gems: introduction\\" Roman gems generally continued Hellenistic styles, and can be hard to date, until their quality sharply declines at the end of the 2nd century AD. Philosophers are sometimes shown; Cicero refers to people having portraits of their favourite on their cups and rings.Boardman, 275-6 The Romans invented cameo glass, best known from the Portland Vase, as a cheaper material for cameos, and one that allowed consistent and predictable layers on even round objects. There are several antique and medieval engraved gems on the Ottonian Cross of Lothair (base later). Many antique engraved gems survived in such contexts. During the European Middle Ages antique engraved gems were one classical art form which was always highly valued, and a large but unknown number of ancient gems have (unlike most surviving classical works of art) never been buried and then excavated. Gems were used to decorate elaborate pieces of goldsmith work such as votive crowns, book-covers and crosses, sometimes very inappropriately given their subject matter. Matthew Paris illustrated a number of gems owned by St Albans Abbey, including one large Late Roman imperial cameo (now lost) called Kaadmau which was used to induce overdue childbirths ‚Äì it was slowly lowered, with a prayer to St Alban, on its chain down the woman's cleavage, as it was believed that the infant would flee downwards to escape it,Henderson, 112-113 a belief in accordance with the views of the \\"father of mineralogy\\", Georgius Agricola (1494‚Äì1555) on jasper.De Natura fossilium Bk 1 Some gems were engraved, mostly with religious scenes in intaglio, during the period both in Byzantium and Europe.Examples: 14th century French Crucifixion, Rosary pendant, 15th century, both onyx and in the MMA New York. In the West production revived from the Carolingian period, when rock crystal was the commonest material. The Lothair Crystal (or Suzanna Crystal, British Museum, 11.5 cm diameter), clearly not designed for use as a seal, is the best known of 20 surviving Carolingian large intaglio gems with complex figural scenes, although most were used for seals.Kornbluth, 1, 4. Susanna Crystal, British Museum. Several crystals were designed, like the Susanna Crystal, to be viewed through the gem from the unengraved side, so their inscriptions were reversed like the seals. In wills and inventories, engraved gems were often given pride of place at the head of a list of treasures.Kornbluth, 1, 4-6 Some gems in a remarkably effective evocation of classical style were made in Southern Italy for the court of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor in the first half of the 13th century, several in the Cabinet des M√©dailles in Paris. Meanwhile, the church led the development of large, often double-sided, metal seal matrices for wax seals that were left permanently attached to charters and similar legal documents, dangling by a cord, though smaller ring seals that were broken when a letter was opened remained in use. It is not clear to what extent this also continued practices in the ancient world. Renaissance revival Warrior supporting dying comrade. 1st century BC or AD. The late medieval French and Burgundian courts collected and commissioned gems, and began to use them for portraits. The British Museum has what is probably a seated portrait of John, Duke of Berry in intaglio on a sapphire, and the Hermitage has a cameo head of Charles VII of France.Campbell, 411 Interest had also revived in Early Renaissance Italy, where Venice soon became a particular centre of production. Along with the Roman statues and sarcophagi being newly excavated, antique gems were prime sources for artists eager to regain a classical figurative vocabulary. Cast bronze copies of gems were made, which circulated around Italy, and later Europe.Draper, James David. \\"Cameo Appearances\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. (August 2008) Among very many examples of borrowings that can be traced confidently, the Felix or Diomedes gem owned by Lorenzo de' Medici (see below), with an unusual pose, was copied by Leonardo da Vinci and may well have provided the \\"starting point\\" for one of Michelangelo's ignudi on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.Claire Clark, Kenneth in J.

Google books By the 16th century carved and engraved gems were keenly collected across Europe for dedicated sections of a cabinet of curiosities, and their production revived, in classical styles; 16th-century gem-cutters working with the same types of sardonyx and other hardstones and using virtually the same techniques, produced classicizing works of glyptic art, often intended as forgeries, in such quantity that they compromised the market for them, as Gisela Richter observed in 1922.\\"Nowadays, however, they have been somewhat neglected‚Äîprobably because a genuine gem is difficult to distinguish from forged one, and collectors have grown timid in consequence\\" (Richter, \\"Engraved Gems\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, 17.9 (September 1922:193-196) p. 193 Even today, Sir John Boardman admits that \\"We are sometimes at a loss to know whether what we are looking at belongs to the 1st or the 15th century AD, a sad confession for any art-historian.\\"Beazley, Boardman lecture Other Renaissance gems reveal their date by showing mythological scenes derived from literature that were not part of the visual repertoire in classical times, or borrowing compositions from Renaissance paintings, and using \\"compositions with rather more figures than any ancient engraver would have tolerated or attempted\\". Among artists, the wealthy Rubens was a notable collector.Getty, Collectors Parallel traditions Engraved gems occur in the Bible, especially when the hoshen and ephod worn by the High Priest are described; though these were inscribed with the names of the tribes of Israel in letters, rather than any images. A few identifiably Jewish gems survive from the classical world, including Persia, mostly with the owner's name in Hebrew, but some with symbols such as the menorah.Beazley Archive, \\"Late Antique, Early Christian and Jewish gems: Sasanian gems ‚Äì Christian and Jewish\\" Many gems are inscribed in the Islamic world, typically with verses from the Koran, and sometimes gems in the Western tradition just contain inscriptions. Many Asian and Middle Eastern cultures have their own traditions, although for example the important Chinese tradition of carved gemstones and hardstones, especially jade carving, is broader than the European one of concentration on a flattish faced stone that might fit into a ring. Seal engraving covers the inscription that is printed by stamping, which nearly always only contains script rather than images. Other decoration of the seal itself was not intended to be reproduced. Iconography the Gemma Augustea cameo, in two layered onyx; 19 √ó 23 cm. The iconography of gems is similar to that of coins, though more varied. Early gems mostly show animals. Gods, satyrs, and mythological scenes were common, and famous statues often represented ‚Äì much modern knowledge of the poses of lost Greek cult statues such as Athena Promachos comes from the study of gems, which often have clearer images than coins.Numismatic evidence is the other most indicative evidence of the general pose of locally important cult images. A 6th(?) century BC Greek gem already shows Ajax committing suicide, with his name inscribed.Beazley, Geometric and Early Archaic gems: Island gems 6th down. The story of Heracles was, as in other arts, the most common source of narrative subjects. A scene may be intended as the subject of an early Archaic gem, and certainly appears on 6th century examples from the later Archaic period.Beazley, Archaic period pages Portraits of monarchs are found from the Hellenistic period onwards, although as they do not usually have identifying inscriptions, many fine ones cannot be identified with a subject. In the Roman Imperial period, portraits of the imperial family were often produced for the court circle, and many of these have survived, especially a number of spectacular cameos from the time of Augustus. As private objects, produced no doubt by artists trained in the tradition of Hellenistic monarchies, their iconography is less inhibited than the public state art of the period about showing divine attributes as well as sexual matters.Hennig, 154-5. British Museum on the Blacas Cameo of Augustus. The identity and interpretation of figures in the Gemma Augustea remains unclear. A number of gems from the same period contain scenes apparently from the lost epic on the Sack of Troy, of which the finest is by Dioskurides (Chatsworth House).Hennig, 153, Boardman, 275-6 Renaissance and later gems remain dominated by the Hellenistic repertoire of subjects, though portraits in contemporary styles were also produced. Collectors The Coupe des Ptol√©m√©es (Cabinet des M√©dailles, Paris) Famous collectors begin with King Mithridates VI of Pontus (d. 63 BC), whose collection was part of the booty of Pompey the Great, who donated it to the Temple of Jupiter in Rome.Pliny, see below. Whether he was right to claim Mithridates as the first collector is dubious. Julius Caesar was determined to excel Pompey in this as in other areas, and later gave six collections to his own Temple of Venus Genetrix; according to Suetonius gems were among his varied collecting passions.De Vita Caesarum, Divus Iulius, (The Lives of the Caesars, The Deified Julius), Fordham online text Many later emperors also collected gems. Chapters 4-6 of Book 37 of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder give a summary art history of the Greek and Roman tradition, and of Roman collecting. According to Pliny Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC) was the first Roman collector.Pliny, Natural History, xxxvii.5 As in later periods objects carved in the round from semi-precious stone were regarded as a similar category of object; these are also known as hardstone carvings. One of the largest, the Coupe des Ptol√©m√©es was probably donated to the Basilica of Saint-Denis, near Paris, by Charles the Bald, as the inscription on its former gem-studded gold Carolingian mounting stated; it may have belonged to Charlemagne. One of the best collections of such vessels, though mostly plain without carved decoration, was looted from Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, and is in the Treasury of the Basilica of San Marco in Venice. Many of these retain the medieval mounts which adapted them for liturgical use. Like the Coupe des Ptol√©m√©es, most objects in European museums lost these when they became objects of classicist interest from the Renaissance onwards, or when the mounts were removed for the value of the materials, as happened to many in the French Revolution. The Gonzaga Cameo in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg. The gem measures 15,7 x 11,8 cm.

Somewhat like Chinese collectors, Lorenzo had all his gems inscribed with his name.Online: The Introduction from Lorenzo de'Medici, Collector of Antiquities, by Laurie Fusco & Gino Corti, Cambridge UP 2006, which gives a survey of early Renaissance collecting in general. On his signing his gems see Draper The Gonzaga Cameo passed through a series of famous collections before coming to rest in the Hermitage. First known in the collection of Isabella d'Este, it passed to the Gonzaga Dukes of Mantua, Emperor Rudolf II, Queen Christina of Sweden, Cardinal Decio Azzolini, Livio Odescalchi, Duke of Bracciano, and Pope Pius VI before Napoleon carried it off to Paris, where his Empress Jos√©phine gave it to Alexander I of Russia after Napoleon's downfall, as a token of goodwill.Gonzaga Cameo Exhibition in Mantua further details It remains disputed whether the cameo is Alexandrian work of the 3rd century BC, or a Julio-Claudian imitation of the style from the 1st century AD. Three of the largest cameo gems from antiquity were created for members of the Julio- Claudian dynasty and seem to have survived above ground since antiquity. The large Gemma Augustea appeared in 1246 in the treasury of the Basilique St- Sernin, Toulouse. In 1533, King Fran√ßois I appropriated it and moved it to Paris, where it soon disappeared around 1590. Not long thereafter it was fenced for 12,000 gold pieces to Emperor Rudolph II; it remains in Vienna, alongside the Gemma Claudia. The largest flat engraved gem known from antiquity is the Great Cameo of France, which entered (or re-entered) the French royal collection in 1791 from the treasury of Sainte-Chapelle, where it had been since at least 1291. 1st century BC cameo with Troilus and Polyxena surprised by Achilles. Later mount. In England, a false dawn of gem collecting was represented by Henry, Prince of Wales' purchase of the cabinet of the Flemish antiquary Abraham Gorlaeus in 1609,Roy Strong, Henry Prince of Wales and England's Lost Renaissance (1986:199). and engraved gems featured among the antiquities assembled by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel. Later in the century William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire, formed a collection of gems that is still conserved at Chatsworth.Diana Scarisbrick, \\"The Devonshire Parure\\", Archaeologia 108 (1986:241). In the eighteenth century a more discerning cabinet of gems was assembled by Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle, acting upon the advice of Francesco Maria Zanetti and Francesco Ficoroni; 170 of the Carlisle gems, both Classical and post-Classical, were purchased in 1890 for the British Museum. By the mid-eighteenth century prices had reached such a level that major collections could only be formed by the very wealthy; lesser collectors had to make do with collecting plaster casts,\\"Sulphurs\\" provided even finer detail; James Tassie made a career of casting gems in plaster and in coloured opaque glass. which was also very popular, or buying one of many sumptuously illustrated catalogues of collections that were published.Apart from those mentioned below, there is information on other notable collections from the Getty Museum Catherine the Great's collection is in the Hermitage Museum; one large collection she had bought was the gems from the Orl√©ans Collection. Louis XV of France hired Dominique Vivant to assemble a collection for Madame de Pompadour. Casts (\\"pastes\\") of gems in collector's cabinets In the eighteenth century British aristocrats were able to outcompete even the agents for royal and princely collectors on the Continent, aided by connoisseur-dealers like Count Antonio Maria Zanetti and Philipp von Stosch. Zanetti travelled Europe in pursuit of gems hidden in private collections for the British aristocrats he tutored in connoisseurship;His correspondence with Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle is published by Diana Scarisbrick, \\"Gem Connoisseurship ‚Äì The 4th Earl of Carlisle's Correspondence with Francesco de Ficoroni and Antonion Maria Zanetti\\", The Burlington Magazine 129No. 1007 (February 1987:90-104). his own collection was described in A.F. Gori, Le gemme antiche di Anton Maria Zanetti (Venice, 1750), illustrated with eighty plates of engravings from his own drawings. Baron Philipp von Stosch (1691‚Äì1757), a Prussian who lived in Rome and then Florence, was a major collector, as well as a dealer in engraved gems: \\"busy, unscrupulous, and in his spare time a spy for England in Italy\\".Beazley, Boardman Lecture Among his contemporaries, Stosch made his lasting impression with Gemm√¶ Antiqu√¶ C√¶lat√¶ (Pierres antiques grave√©s) (1724), in which Bernard Picart's engravings reproduced seventy antique carved hardstones like onyx, jasper and carnelian from European collections. He also encouraged Johann Lorenz Natter (1705‚Äì1763) whom Stosch set to copying ancient carved gems in Florence. Frederick the Great of Prussia bought Stosch's collection in 1765 and built the Antique Temple in the park of the Sanssouci Palace to house his collections of ancient sculpture, coins and over 4,000 gems ‚Äì the two were naturally often grouped together. The gems are now in the Antikensammlung Berlin. Vishnu Nicolo Seal is a cast of sardonyx seal representing Vishnu blessing a worshipper, Afghanistan or Pakistan, 4th-6th century AD. The inscription in cursive Bactrian reads: \\"Mikira, Vishnu and Shiva\\" The collection of Joseph Smith, British consul in Venice was bought by George III of England and remains in the Royal Collection. The collections of Charles Towneley, Richard Payne Knight and Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode were bought by or bequeathed to the British Museum, founding their very important collection.Towneley's were bought from his heirs, the others bequeathed. See King, 218-225 for a selection of highlights But the most famous English collection was that formed by the 4th Duke of Marlborough (1739‚Äì1817), \\"which the Duke kept in his bedroom and resorted to as a relief from his ambitious wife, his busy sister and his many children\\".Beazley, Marlborough Collection This included collections formerly owned by the Gonzagas of Mantua (later owned by Lord Arundel), the 2nd Earl of Bessborough, and the brother of Lord Chesterfield, who himself warned his son in one of his Letters against \\"days lost in poring upon imperceptible intaglios and cameos\\".Beazley, The Marlborough Gems, Boardman Lecture. The collection, including its single most famous cameo, the \\"Marlborough gem\\" depicting an initiation of Cupid and Psyche, was dispersed after a sale in 1899, fortunately timed for the new American museums and provided the core of the collection of the Metropolitan in New York and elsewhere, with the largest group still together being about 100 in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore.Walters, \\"Gems belonging to the Fourth Duke of Marlborough in the Walters\\" Prince Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski (1754‚Äì1833) \\"commissioned about 2500 gems and encouraged the belief that they were, in fact, ancient.\\" He presented a set of 419 plaster impressions of his collection to the King of Prussia which now form the Daktyliothek Poniatowski in Berlin, where they were recognised as modern in 1832, mainly because the signatures of ancient artists from very different times were found on gems in too consistent a style.Beazley, The Poniatowski Collection of gems. More details in The Bernie Madoff of Gem Collectors Artists Tityus, a rock crystal intaglio by Giovanni Bernardi. As in other fields, not many ancient artists' names are known from literary sources, although some gems are signed. According to Pliny, Pyrgoteles was the only artist allowed to carve gems for the seal rings of Alexander the Great. Most of the most famous Roman artists were Greeks, like Dioskurides, who is thought to have produced the Gemma Augustea, and is recorded as the artist of the matching signet rings of Augustus ‚Äì very carefully controlled, they allowed orders to be issued in his name by his most trusted associates. Other works survive signed by him (rather more than are all likely to be genuine), and his son Hyllos was also a gem engraver.Boardman, 275-6. Hennig 153-4 The Anichini family were leading artists in Venice and elsewhere in the 15th and 16th centuries. Many Renaissance artists no doubt kept their activities quiet, as they were passing their products off as antique. Other specialist carvers included Giovanni Bernardi (1494‚Äì1553), Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio (c. 1500‚Äì1565), Giuseppe Antonio Torricelli (1662‚Äì1719), the German-Italian Anton Pichler (1697‚Äì1779) and his sons Giovanni and Luigi, Charles Christian Reisen (Anglo-Norwegian, 1680‚Äì1725). Other sculptors also carved gems, or had someone in their workshop who did. Leone Leoni said he personally spent two months on a double-sided cameo gem with portraits of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and his wife and son.Metropolitan The Scot James Tassie (1735‚Äì1799), and his nephew William (1777‚Äì1860) developed methods for taking hard impressions from old gems, and also for casting new designs from carved wax in enamel, enabling a huge production of what are really imitation engraved gems. The fullest catalogue of his impressions (\\"Tassie gems\\") was published in 1791, with 15,800 items.An earlier version is on Google books A Catalogue, Of Impressions In Sulphur: Of Antique And Modern Gems From Which Pastes Are Made And Sold (1775) ( / 1-104-59093-X) There are complete sets of the impressions in the Hermitage, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, and in Edinburgh.Beazley, Tassie Other types of imitation became fashionable for ladies' brooches, such as ceramic cameos by Josiah Wedgwood in jasperware. The engraved gem fell permanently out of fashion from about the 1860s, perhaps partly as a growing realization of the number of gems that were not what they seemed to be scared collectors. Among the last practitioners was James Robertson, who sensibly moved into the new art of photography. Perhaps the best known gem engraver of the 20th century, working in a contemporary idiom, is the British artist Ronald Pennell,Significant Figures in Art & Craft Today, Derek Reay, MoTi publishing, UK 2011 whose work is held in the British Crafts Council Collection among many others.

Cameo glass was invented by the Romans in about 30BC to imitate engraved hardstone cameos, with the advantage that consistent layering could be achieved even on round vessels ‚Äì impossible with natural gemstones. It was however very difficult to manufacture and surviving pieces, mostly famously the Portland Vase, are actually much rarer than Roman gemstone cameos.Trentinella, Rosemarie. \\"Roman Cameo Glass\\".

The Middle Ages, which lived by charters and other sealed documents, were at least as keen on using seals as the ancient world, now creating them for towns and church institutions, but they normally used metal matrices and signet rings. However some objects, like a 13th-century Venetian Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, mimicked the engraved gem.picture and link Another offshoot of the mania for engraved gems is the fine-grained slightly translucent stoneware called jasperware that was developed by Josiah Wedgwood and perfected in 1775.Robin Reilly, Wedgwood Jasper London, 1972. Though white-on-blue matte jasperware is the most familiar Wedgwood ceramic line, still in production today and widely imitated since the mid-19th century, white-on-black was also produced. Wedgwood made notable jasperware copies of the Portland Vase and the Marlborough gem, a famous head of Antinous,Antinoos.info See \\"Gems\\" section for gem and casts etc and interpreted in jasperware casts from antique gems by James Tassie. John Flaxman's neoclassical designs for jasperware were carried out in the extremely low relief typical of cameo production. Some other porcelain imitated three-layer cameos purely by paint, even in implausible objects like a flat S√®vres tea-tray of 1840.S√®vres tea-tray from the Metropolitan museum of Art Scholars Gems were a favourite topic for antiquaries from the Renaissance onwards, culminating in the work of Philipp von Stosch, described above. Major progress in understanding Greek gems was made in the work of Adolf Furtw√§ngler (1853‚Äì1907, father of the conductor, Wilhelm). Among recent scholars Sir John Boardman (b. 1927) has made a special contribution, again concentrating on Greek gems. Gertrud Seidmann (1919‚Äì2013) moved into the subject, having previously been a German teacher. NotesReferences *\\"Beazley\\" The Classical Art Research Centre, Oxford University.

The Abalakov thread is a common method of protecting oneself while ice climbing because it is easy to create, does not require the sacrifice of expensive gear, and can be very safe when used properly. An Abalakov thread is often used in multi-pitch ice climbing routes. Because of its safety and convenience, the Abalakov thread is considered one of the most significant innovations in ice climbing. It significantly expanded the scope of possible routes and abseiling safety.  Description  An Abalakov thread can be constructed using an ice screw, of appropriate strength cord or webbing, and hook-like Abalakov threading device. Two holes are drilled in the ice, which interconnect at the ends to form a v-like channel in the ice. The cord or webbing is then threaded through this hole, and tied with a knot such as a fisherman's knot, or a water knot. This loop is then used to hang the abseiling rope. Abalakov thread can only be constructed in solid ice (or quality rock). The holes need to be drilled at the correct angle (about 45‚Äì50¬∞ compared to ice surface), and care must be taken that they interconnect. The surfaces of the holes need to have sufficient distance (about ) between them. If the ice is not strong enough, it is possible to use two Abalakovs to balance the force, although if this is needed, an alternate route is strongly recommended.http://www.climbingextreme.com/?p=161 A 2009 finding and experiments have shown a vertical rather than horizontal arrangement of the holes to be stronger (12%) (Smith, 2009). This configuration has been termed the A thread.http://www.itrsonline.org/PapersFolder/2009/SmithGordon- Allen2009_ITRSPaper_VThread.pdf Though the Abalakov thread is considered to be as strong as any ice screw placement, a backup ice screw is frequently used for the first abseil. This allows for increased safety if mistakes were made in the creation of the Abalakov thread, and allows the strength of the thread to be observed. Notes A V-thread and an A-thread are the same thing, but an A-thread often refers to the thread being vertically-oriented (holes are one above the other) and a V-thread is horizontally-oriented (side by side).https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/107995375/v-thread- toolshttps://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14830/how-much-stronger-is- a-vertical-v-thread-than-a-horizontal-one A 0-thread is sometimes referred to when the rope is threaded through the holes instead of a sacrificial piece of webbing or cord. The advantage is that you leave no trace however, the rope can freeze.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzf4t6WJ934 Typically used in ice, but is sometimes used in canyoning when traditional bolted anchors have been or will get damaged during the wet season.

Masterson (October 31, 1917 - May 1998) was the Special Assistant to the President on the White House Staff during the Eisenhower Administration. Masterson was born in New York, New York and received a B.A. from Long Island University in 1938. He earned a M.A. and a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1939 and 1952, respectively. Masterson, prior to joining the White House staff, had been in the public relations business in New York City and before that a college professor (English, History and Public Speaking at Long Island University and Pace College in New York). Shortly after the Eisenhower administration became settled in the White House, there appeared the need to keep the public informed of the current policies, accomplishments and goals of the President and his administration. Thus, shortly after Inauguration Day, Val Peterson (former Governor of Nebraska) was appointed to a position as an Administrative Assistant to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was to act as presidential liaison with the various cabinet departments and independent agencies. Upon his leaving in March of that same year to assume the post of Administrator of the Federal Civil Defense Administration, Walter Williams and his (acting) special assistant, Stanley M. Rumbough, Jr. assumed the task of liaison between the White House, the cabinet departments and independent agencies. Walter Williams (then Under Secretary of Commerce), originally brought into the White House to establish a system of nationwide economic reporters, resumed his duties at the Commerce Department in late 1953. In September 1953, his position was filled by Charles F. Masterson, a former associate of both Rumbough and Charlie Willis, having worked with them in the National Citizens for Eisenhower organization in the 1952 campaign.Federal Records Division, National Archives and Records Administration. United States Government Organization Manual, 1955 ‚Äì 1956. Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office. 1955 -1956. p. 62 During the period in which Dr. Masterson worked on the White House Staff, the Executive Branch Liaison Office (of which he was a member) performed three major functions. First, it acted as the liaison between the White House, Cabinet departments and the independent agencies. To accomplish this, Masterson and Rumbough brought about the production of Fact Papers. These fact papers were issued weekly. These papers were meant to acquaint members of the Eisenhower team (including ambassadors) with information on current administration problems, pronouncements and goals, in brief, legible form. Fact Papers were duplicated and sent throughout the country by the Young Republicans, the Women's Division of the Republican National Committee and members of the Republican Congressional Committee (who, in turn, sent them to GOP congressmen for use in speeches and newsletters). As of January 1955, actual circulation of the Fact Papers had reached 100,000. Spokesmen for the administration were urged to use the Fact Papers as a ready reference in their speeches and other contacts with the public. The second function was that of liaison between the White House and the Republican National Committee. The Executive Branch Liaison Office provided Fact Papers for its distribution and for use as copy in its publication (newsletter) \\"Straight From the Shoulder.\\" The third function of this office was not as a speakers‚Äô bureau, but as a speakers‚Äô coordination center, i.e. it organized and established a system for using speakers‚Äô bureaus throughout the Executive Branch. This procedure helped greatly to relax the strained national-state party relations. Aside from his other duties, Dr. Masterson also helped to draft speeches and correspondence for various members of the White House Staff (such as Sherman Adams, Bernard Shanley, Frank Leahy, Governor Pyle and Fred Seaton). He infrequently drafted speeches for use by the President. Dr. Masterson resigned from the staff of the Executive Branch Liaison Office on November 28, 1956, returning, in association with Stanley Rumbough, Jr., to a public relations office in New York City. Dr. Masterson was a man of varied talents. For ten years, he was ranked among the top 25 tennis players in the United States, his highest ranking being 14. He was the author of two books on world history and a beginners book on golf. Masterson died in May 1998 at the age of 80.Charles F Masterson ReferencesExternal links * Records of Charles F.

Currently it is a protected place lying within the Karnala Bird Sanctuary. It was a place of strategic importance since it overlooked the Bor pass, which connected the Konkan coast to the interior of Maharashtra (Deccan Plateau) on the main trade route between these areas.  History  The fort was likely constructed before 1400, under Devagiri Yadavs(1248‚Äì1318) and the Tughlaq rulers (1318‚Äì1347), Karnala was the capital of the north Konkan districts of their respective empires. It later fell under the command of the Gujarat Sultanate but in 1540 was taken over by Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar. The Gujarat sultans then requested the help of the Dom Francisco de Menenzes the commanding officer of the Portuguese at Bassien (modern day Vasai) to win it back. He ordered 500 of his soldiers to Karnala fort and they were able to capture it. The fort was left in charge of the Gujarat Sultanate but with Portuguese garrisons. The Gujarat sultans fled to Vasai, surrendering the fort to the Portuguese. The loss of Karnala enraged Nizam Shah, who sent 5,000 men to reclaim the fort and the surrounding countryside. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the Portuguese continued to hold the fort. Deciding that the forts of Sangli and Karnala were of little strategic value, however, the Portuguese viceroy agreed to return them to Nizam Shah for an annual payment of Rs. 17,500 (or 5,000 gold Pardoas). Shivaji Maharaj conquered it from the Mughals in 1670 by building breastworks as he advanced. After his death in 1680 it was taken over by Aurangzeb. After this the Mughals occupied it for some time after which it in 1740 with the rise of the Peshwas of Pune it went to them. It remained under the command of killedar (garrison commander) Anantrao until a colonel Prother won the fort and established the rule of the British East India Company there in 1818.  Trekking to the Fort  Today, the ruins of the fort are a popular destination for hiking and tourism. There are two trails that lead to the fort - Karnala fort trail and nature trail. The Karnala fort trail trek is a 1 hour/2.69 kilometres trek from the bottom of the hill. There are 5 resting places on the pathway made by forest department. The final climbing steps near the entrance of the fort are made safe by iron railings. It is not advisable to cook food at the base of the pinnacle, as the smell of smoke irritates the Honey Bees. The water from the southernmost rock cut water cistern is potable. First aid is available at the forest guest house. The nature trail is a shorter (1.20 kilometre) and a steeper approach to the fort. Trekking during the monsoon is really an exhilarating experience.  Major features  Karnala fort bastion with steps Karnala fort actually consists of two forts one at a higher level and other lower. At the centre of the higher level is a 125 feet high basalt pillar. It is also called Pandu's tower. This structure was used as watchtower when the fort was occupied however now it is in a ruined condition. The presence of bee hives also makes it difficult to climb and have resulted in at least one casualty in recent times. There is a water cistern which provides fresh water all year long. From the top the forts of Prabalgad, Manikgad, Haji Malang, Chanderi fort, Matheran, Sankshi fort, Dronagiri fort, and Rajmachi are clearly visible. The fort has two inscriptions one in Marathi and the other in Persian. The Marathi inscription which has no date is seen on the lower gate on the inner side. Its words are indecipherable. The Persian writing is on upper gate reads \\"Syed Nuruddin Muhammad Khan, Hijri, 1147 AH (1735 CE)\\" and probably dates from the Mughal occupation of the fort. This rock cut inscription has been removed by some miscreants long back. Bhavani Temple Bhavani Temple at the bottom of Karnala fort. There is a temple dedicated to goddess Bhavani located at the bottom of the fort. It is said that the goddess gave a sword to king Shivaji, which he then used to conquer a vast area of land for the establishment of a Hindu nation.

Its main editorial focus was on life in Paris for both residents and visitors. Launched on a shoestring budget as a 24-page black-and-white tabloid, Passion eventually evolved into a glossy 140-page magazine. Passion was conceived as a forum for the written word and to showcase the visual side of Paris. It regularly published excellent photography and benefited from the pool of creative illustrators in Paris. The magazine‚Äôs use of strong eye-catching visuals on its large format covers was an influential part of its identity. History Launched in November 1981, Paris Passion was an English-language magazine in France that existed until early 1991. Its main editorial focus was on life in Paris for both residents and visitors. Also known as Passion, it featured an eclectic mix of feature journalism, interviews with leading figures in Paris, city consumer advice, coverage of French arts, culture, politics, design, architecture, food and fashion and was also a regular showcase for excellent photography. For many years, Passion also had a detachable events-listings section, published short fiction by Paris-based writers, a French-language section, and a separate fashion supplement called Accent. First Issue, November 1981 Despite good distribution and a relatively high profile in Paris, Passion was more a critical success than a financial one. Its financial struggle undermined the magazine's full editorial potential. Passion began on a shoestring budget as a 24-page black-and-white tabloid and eventually evolved into a full-fledged glossy 140-page magazine. Over its nine-plus years, Passion published 78 issues. At its peak, the circulation reached 50,000 copies, with almost a quarter of that distributed outside France. It was sold and displayed prominently in news kiosks and bookstores in Paris and even had street hawkers selling it in certain parts of the city. It was available in international newsstands in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Toronto, Montreal, London, and Amsterdam and had subscribers in many countries. In addition to its practical information and extensive arts and entertainment coverage, Passion became popular also for its often irreverent and humorous (but not mocking) take on the French and the challenges and idiosyncrasies of Paris life. It did not shy away from serious issues. It tackled everything from the political intrigues at Paris City Hall to urban planning fiascoes to anti- Semitism in France to drug-related social problems in Paris to the plight of North African immigrants in France and a variety of environmental concerns. Passion can be seen as part of the time-honored tradition of expatriate English-language publishing in Paris that dates back to the early 20th century. Over the years, there have been numerous, mostly literary, publications published in English in the French capital, most of them short- lived. Passion was founded by expatriate Canadian journalist Robert Sarner. He moved to Paris in 1979 from Toronto where he had begun his career in journalism a few years earlier. Before starting Passion, Sarner took part in the Paris-based 'Journalists In Europe' fellowship program. His partners in the magazine were Michael Budman and Don Green, both originally from Detroit and the co-founders of Roots Canada Ltd. (a successful apparel company and lifestyle brand). Sarner was the Editor-in-Chief and Publisher, while Budman and Green were the Executive Publishers. Sarner had first met Budman and Green in Canada a few years earlier when he approached them for investment in a city magazine that he had hoped to launch in Toronto. In 1988, the London-based city magazine Time Out purchased the majority of Paris Passion. Time Out's owner Tony Elliott became the co-publisher with Robert Sarner who also remained the Editor-in-Chief. Under the new ownership, Passion adopted a more conventional physical format, expanded its staff and moved into new, better- equipped headquarters. Two and a half years later, following a difference of opinion over the direction of the magazine, Elliott squeezed out Sarner in mid-1990. Elliott then brought in staff from London, redesigned the magazine, and changed the editorial style from American to British. But the business faltered further and Time Out ended up closing the magazine in 1991. In the 1990s, Time Out used the Paris Passion name in conjunction with some of the annual Paris guides it published during that period. Editorial content Paris Passion was conceived as both a forum for the written word and a showcase of the visual side of the city. One of its main objectives was to engage both the minds and the eyes of readers. To that end, the magazine drew on a wealth of freelance talent based in Paris that shared the editorial aims of its editors. Despite limited financial means, Passion featured well- established journalists, photographers and illustrators while also developing many younger writers who had rarely been published before. Writers As a magazine based in, and focused on, Paris, Passion attracted a wide range of talented expatriate writers and journalists eager to have their work published in English in a creative magazine circulated both in France and abroad. Some were longtime Paris residents, others were more recent arrivals. Most of the writers came from English-speaking counties, including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India; others were French, (especially during the period when each issue of Passion published several pages in French). Collectively, they wrote many articles, columns, reviews and short stories that in one way or another related to Paris. The following are some of the writers who contributed to Passion (listed in alphabetical order): Kathy Acker, John Baxter, Chris Boicos, Clement Barclay.

The visual side Paris Passion was a visually striking magazine, thanks both to its large format and the quality of its photography, illustration and art direction. Its visual presentation, most of which focused on Paris, was an important part of its appeal. Photography Starting with its first issue, Paris Passion always showed an appreciation for good photography, devoting generous space to photo essays, portfolios and portraits of Parisians. Photography was an intrinsic part of the magazine and helped shaped its identity. It was a natural development given the large number of talented photographers and leading photo agencies and galleries in Paris. On a regular basis, Passion showcased the work of some of the world's leading photographers working in Paris. In the process, the magazine earned an enviable reputation for the quality of images featured in its pages. The following are some of the photographers who worked with Passion and/or whose work was featured prominently in the magazine (listed in alphabetical order): Jim Allen, Arnaud Bauman, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Clement Barclay, Chalkie Davies, Francois Dischinger, Barry Dunne, Christophe Galatry, Jean-Paul Goude, Frank Horvat, Benjamin Kanarek, William Klein, Xavier Lambours, Antoine LeGrand, Elizabeth Lennard, Erica Lennard, Jonathan Lennard, Berangere Lomont, Wily Maywald, Doug Metzler, Jacques Mitelman, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Helmut Newton, Scott Osman, Andre Ostier, Ian Patrick, Alain Potignon, Ray Reynolds, Bettina Rheims, David Rochline, David Seidner, Jean-Loup Sieff, Alice Springs, Lawrence Sudre, Keichi Tahara, Patrick Trautwein, Peter Turnley, Ellen von Unwerth, Javier Vallhonrat, Claus Wickrath, Patrick Wilen, Michael Williams, Rafael Winer. Illustration As part of its design, Paris Passion also benefited from the enormous pool of gifted illustrators in Paris. It commissioned many French and expatriate illustrators to create images to enhance editorial content in the magazine. The following are some of the illustrators who worked with Passion and/or whose work was featured prominently in the magazine (listed in alphabetical order): Fran√ßois Avril, Jean-Paul Buquet, Helene Cote, Milo Daax, Jean-Philippe Delhomme, Bil Donovan, Blair Drawson, David Dudu Geva, Diana Huff, Myles Hyman, Antonio Lopez, Patricia Marx, Tina Mercier, Philippe Petit-Roulet, Patricia Reznikav, Michael Roberts, Hippolyte Romain, Laurie Rosenwald, Tignous, Solweig Vonkleist. Art direction Among the graphic artists and art directors who worked with Passion and contributed to the look of the magazine were Layne Jackson, Nancy Dorking, Judith Christ, Scott Minick, Tony Judge and R√©my Magron.

The changes included going from black-and- white images to those in full color; from newsprint to glossy stock; from celebrity portraits to more conceptual illustrations; and different logos and varying approaches to the use of text. During the life of Passion, its use of strong, eye-catching visuals on its large format covers was an influential part of its identity. Passion favored simple, clean, bold, colorful images to grab the attention of readers. It stemmed, in part, from the fact that as a magazine relying mainly on newsstands for its distribution, it had to stand out from other publications in order to establish and promote itself, especially in the absence of any marketing budget. In Paris, in addition to its presence on newsstands and in kiosks, Passion also had a network of \\"street hawkers\\" who sold the magazine. They circulated in places where potential readers would congregate, from hip cafes and restaurants to major cultural events, fashion shows and tourist attractions where hawkers would hold up the latest issue for all to see, and hopefully buy. The cover played a critical role in determining the perception and sales of the magazine.

It operates under the direct supervision of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin.  History  The Vaskenian Theological Academy of Sevan was re-established in 1990 on the picturesque peninsula of Lake Sevan. The Academy was opened during the Pontificate and with the blessings of Catholicos Vasken I, and by the direct initiative of Karekin II, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, who was then the Vicar of the Araratian Pontifical Diocese. As the re-opening of the Academy was encouraged and approved by Vasken I, it was decided in 1994 by Supreme Patriarch Karekin I that the Academy should be renamed the Vaskenian Theological Academy in honor of Vasken I. During the first stages of its existence the Academy was housed in the ancillary building that was constructed in 1897 by Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian (1892-1907) as a building of the Seminary. However, it was never used for that purpose. In the early 1990s it served both as classrooms and a dormitory building for the students of the Seminary, and a portion of the building was made into a dining room. As the seminary grew, the Seminary property was extended and a stone building was added, to be used as classroom. The original building was converted to a complete dormitory. In addition to the two buildings, the complex encompasses two Churches that are on the Sevan peninsula adjacent to the seminary, the St. Karapet and St. Arakelots Churches, which serve as the heart of the Sevan Seminary. Vaskenian Academy on the Sevan Peninsula as seen from Sevanavank monastery During the course of its history the Vaskenian Seminary, which was always headed and supervised by the Catholicos, had several Deans. Khoren Martirossian (1990-1991), Sasoun Vardanian (1992-1995), Archimandrite Arakel Karamian (later Archbishop) (1995-1996), Minas Martirossian (1996-2000), Bagrat Galstanian (later Archbishop) (2000-2003), Garegin Haroutjunnian (2003-2004), and Mkrtich Proshian (from 2004). Since its foundation the program and schedule of the Seminary underwent various changes. The Seminary has also hosted several symposiums. Hundreds of pilgrims visit every year. Programs Students have completed their 4th, 5th, and 6th year of education at the Gevorkian Theological Seminary at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin since their numbers became too great for the Vaskenian Seminary. The basic curriculum of the seminary includes theology, the Holy Church Fathers, literature, history, art, new and old testament, patristics, liturgics and traditions of the Armenian Church. Each year the students are expected to create a lot of written work, which is compiled into an annual yearbook or catalog of work, for archival and historical purposes. In 2005 the seminary started a program of translation of important works. Students with good translation skills translate major works into English and Russian; they are then edited and published. Later a Green Theology program was introduced, addressing ecological issues.

The capacity of the seminary was increased with the addition of a new dormitory; increasing capacity to 80 students. The Gevorkian Seminary has 150 students. The seminary consists of an academic and a dormitory building. There is a smaller building connecting the two that served as the old dining hall. Above the seminary at the top of the hill are two churches, St. Karapet and the Church of the Holy Apostles, which are depicted in many scenes of Lake Sevan.

Its range includes the areas around the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and areas near South Georgia, extending as far south as 57¬∞, close to the Antarctic Peninsula. It lives at depths of . Description T. birsteini resembles a typical lobster, with two large claws, four other pairs of pereiopods, and a long pleon (tail). The carapace is granular, especially in the front half, and it bears a rostrum which divides into two points at its tip. The total length may range from , with the carapace being long. Smaller individuals are found in shallower waters, and larger individuals are found at greater depths (up to ). There is also latitudinal variation in colour, with northern individuals being pale yellow, while those from further south are maroon. Ecology Little is known about the biological interactions of T. birsteini. It is occasionally eaten by the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides. It seems to prefer muddy bottoms, and has been observed entering and exiting burrows. Life cycle As in other pleocyemates, T. birsteini broods its eggs on the female's pleopods. One female may carry up to 380 eggs, each in diameter. The eggs grow as they develop to a size of . Newly hatched larvae have a carapace length of , and are present in smaller numbers than the eggs, with a maximum of 43 observed on a single female. This extended larval release has previously been found in other sub-Antarctic decapods, and is an adaptation to the low temperature, the long time taken for brooding, and the low overall fecundity. Edibility The meat of T. birsteini is reported to be excellent, and it is thought that the species could be commercially exploited if sufficient concentrations could be discovered. The average weight of a caught individual is about , of which 30% () is the meaty tail. Daily yields of are typical.

It was built on an island (Morro de Chaul) which guards the way to the Revdanda Creek. It was meant as a companion to the fort at Chaul. At this strategic position the Portuguese could use it to defend their province which stretched from Korlai to Bassein. Vestiges of the Portuguese occupation are manifested in the distinct dialect of the Korlai villages inhabitants which is a Luso-Indian Portuguese Creole called Kristi.  History  This fort was built in 1521 by the Portuguese with the permission of the Ahmednagar sultanate. In 1521, taking advantage of the confusion in the aftermath of the death of the Burhan Nizam the Portuguese tried to take over the fort. However the sultan retaliated and sent some of his best men to reclaim the fort. Subsequently, a truce was reached in which the Ahmednagar sultanate occupied the island and no further fortification of the island took place. Only a wooden cross remained on the island as a sign of its former rulers. However, in 1594, Abranches, a Portuguese captain with 1,500 soldiers and 1,500 natives took possession of the fort. The besieged soldiers of the Sultanate tried to block their way by putting a dead elephant at the main gate and a dead horse at the inner gate. But in the end they had to surrender. The Portuguese won the fort but not having enough men to stand guard there chose to destroy it leaving only the central tower and a battery intact. Before its destruction, Korlai had been described by travelers as a \\"magnificent fortress as strong as any other in the world\\". On the inland side - the only place where it was susceptible to be attacked it was protected by a ditch and could only be accessed by a drawbridge. The main entrance was guarded by a bronze lion and the highest tower by a bronze eagle. It housed 7,000 horses and as much men. Some parts of it were rebuilt later but now had a garrison of only 50 men. The church within the fort was used for worship on Sundays and holidays. Korlai fort was also strategically very important as it guarded the mouth of the bay. Sambhaji the son of Shivaji tried to take it over but failed and had to withdraw his forces on 6 December 1687. The fort was taken by the Marathas who held it from 1739-1818.  Major features  Inscription on top of the main entrance a view of korlai village from korlai fort a view of korlai village from korlai fort Korlai fort Korlai fort Korlai fort Korlai fort Korlai fort The fort is 2828 feet long, and its average breadth is eighty-nine feet. The enclosing wall is 5' 3\\" high and has 305 battlements for guns. It is entered by eleven gates - four are outer and seven are inner. At the north point, within pistol-shot of main battery is the water cistern named Santa Cruz - major source of water. The area within the fort walls is divided into three enclosures by two lines of bastioned fortifications. Each of the seven bastions bears the name of a saint. The two westward bastions are named S√£o Diego(after Didacus of Alcal√°) and S√£o Francisco (after Francis of Assisi). The others are S√£o Pedro, S√£o In√°cio, and S√£o Filipe. The top of the hill is bastioned as well and is surrounded by a parapet. It has a large rainwater cistern with three mouths, each one foot wide, and the ruins of the magazine and a church. The church was built in 1630 for the use of the army and was functional until 1728. There are three Portuguese inscriptions. One, over a doorway in the centre and highest part of the fort (see picture), reads as follows: > This castle was commanded to be built by the Viceroy of India Dom Filipe > Mascarenhas in November of the year 1646 and Fern√£o Miranda Henriques being > Captain of Chaul, and was finished in May 1680, Crist√≥v√£o de Abreu de > Azevedo being Captain of this fort. The inscription is surmounted by a cross with a coat of arms having the Portuguese stars in the centre and surrounded by seven castles. Other inscriptions over the main entrance and over an altar in the chapel are worn out and undecipherable. During the brief Maratha rule, some of the names of the bastions were changed but now the only indication of their presence is some dismantled shrines. Forest The hill slopes surrounding the fort are in control of the MaharashtraForest department. Originally trees of teak were planted on the eastern slopes later in 1996 plantation of Casuarina, cashew and Acacia auriculiformis was done to check erosion. How to reach It is easily approachable by road. The road from Korlai bus stop ends at the Lighthouse. The fort has three entrance. The entrance from western side is the easiest way, it is from the Lighthouse side. Climbing few steps one reaches in the middle of the fort. The entrance from the eastern side is a tideous walk of 20 minutes. This route is the main route and the entrance is through main gate, but this route is not recommended in rainy season as this is less used route. The entrance from the port side or northern side is good one. One can reach there by walking along a path from the light house.There is ample of water on the topmost fortification, so a night halt can easily be made. Rail The nearest railway station is at Roha which is 42 km from the fort. Road Korlai is around 117 Km south of Mumbai via State Highway 104 and 24 km from Alibag via State Highway 91.

Adorned in hues reminiscent of Goan and Portuguese architecture, these private villas are perched on a secluded stretch of Korlai beach with no permanent habitation for half a kilometer on either side.

It maintains a natural reservoir in the songbird population of freshwater swamps (generally scrub jays and blue jays) and is transmitted by the bite of the female Culiseta melanura mosquito. Though nearly identical in structure and natural cycle to the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, it is considerably less virulent than its cousin, causing relatively mild symptoms in its primary avian reservoir and only nominally capable of transmission to mammals. A 1995 study conducted in Florida swampland found that 15% of swamp- dwelling jays tested positive for HJ antibodies, all of which were asymptomatic and in apparent good health. Recorded bird deaths from HJ infection are uncommon but not rare, and include several domestic turkeys at a commercial facility and young broiler chickens in an experimental setting. Transmission to equines or humans via mosquito is also possible, though even more rare. During the 1990-1991 St. Louis encephalitis outbreak in Missouri, 4 patients were found to be comorbidly infected with SLE and HJ, though no harmful effects were attributed to the HJ alone. A limited survey of swamp- dwelling rodents in Florida found one cotton mouse and one cotton rat with antibodies to HJ, both asymptomatic. The sole mammalian fatality attributed to HJ was a Florida horse originally diagnosed with Western equine encephalitis in 1964, which was later redetermined in 1989 to have been caused by HJ.Rutledge, C. Roxanne. \\"Mosquito-transmitted Highlands J virus in Florida\\". University of Florida. Retrieved 3 February 2009.

The repair shop was established by the city of Minneapolis to reorganize and consolidate the services of the fire department. The shop was also used to convert horse-drawn fire equipment to motorized vehicles. Between 1929 and 1932, the shop built eight large pumpers because the existing Pierce Arrow touring car chassis, the usual platform for fire equipment at the time, had insufficient capacity. Representatives of the Minneapolis Fire Department visited the Milwaukee Fire Department to learn how they were building their own new pumpers. The Minneapolis shop then started building its new pumpers using components from the Four Wheel Drive company. Four Wheel Drive built the engines, drivetrains, suspension components, and other components, while the Minneapolis Fire Department shops provided the frames, bodywork, pumping equipment, and all other firefighting equipment. The Minneapolis Fire Department also completed the assembly of these vehicles. Although the pumpers had an ungainly appearance and were hard to steer, some of these pumpers remained in active service until 1955. As of 2014, the property has been renovated into commercial space containing a restaurant/bar and offices.

The cause of the trial was the murder of C. N. Lakshmikanthan, a Tamil film journalist. Lakshmikanthan was stabbed in Vepery, Madras on 7 November 1944. He died the next morning in General Hospital, Madras. A criminal case was filed and a series of suspects were arrested. The suspects included Tamil film actors M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar and N. S. Krishnan and director S. M. Sriramulu Naidu. While Naidu was acquitted, Bhagavathar and Krishnan were found guilty and convicted. Bhagavathar and Krishnan appealed to the Madras High Court, but their appeals were turned down. The duo remained in jail until 1947, when an appeal to the Privy Council was successful and the Council directed the sessions court to make a fresh retrial. They were found to be innocent and acquitted. The arrest completely broke Bhagavathar's morale. He lost all his money and died in 1959 in penury. Krishnan went on to do a few films, only some of which were successful.  Background = The feud between the accused and Lakshmikanthan  C. N. Lakshmikanthan was an infamous film journalist in Madras Presidency. His foray into journalism began in 1943 when he launched a film weekly called Cinema Thoothu which was extremely successful, due to extensive columns devoted to the personal lives of some of the top actors and actresses of the day. Many actors and actresses responded by paying large amounts of money to \\"buy\\" his silence. As a result, Lakshmikanthan set up a prosperous vocation. Eventually, matters reached a standstill when film actors M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar and N. S. Krishnan and film director Sreeramulu Naidu submitted a memorandum to the Governor of Madras, Arthur Oswald James Hope, requesting him to revoke the license for the magazine. Hope obliged and the license for the magazine was cancelled. Lakshmikanthan tried to run the magazine with forged documents but, after a few months, he was forced to close shop. Unfazed, Lakshmikanthan set up a new magazine called Hindu Nesan in which he continued his scandalous stories on Bhagavathar, Krishnan and a few other top actors, actresses and film people of the day. The tactics paid huge dividends and Lakshmikanthan purchased his own printing press.  Lakshmikanthan's background  Film historian and author Randor Guy writes that Lakshmikanthan had a dark past with a criminal record. As a young man, Lakshmikanthan desired to become a lawyer but could not afford it as his family was not well-off. However, with his sufficient knowledge of law, he managed to establish himself as a \\"tout\\". He was successful for some time but was eventually caught and convicted for forgery. He tried to escape but was captured and imprisoned on a seven-year term at Rajahmundry jail. He tried to escape once again, but was caught and deported to the Andaman Islands. Lakshmikanthan was eventually released when the islands came under Japanese occupation during the Second World War. He returned to India and established himself as a journalist.  The murder  General Collins Road, Vepery In the morning of 8 November 1944, Lakshmikanthan paid a visit to his close friend and lawyer, J. Nargunam, who lived in Vepery, suburb in Madras. En route during return to his residence at the Venkatachala Mudali Street in Purasawalkam, another Madras suburb, by a hand-rickshaw at 10:00 (IST) in General Collins Road, he was attacked by a group of unknown assailants ‚Äî one of whom stabbed him with a knife. He reportedly suffered injuries in the left side of his abdomen among minor wounds on other parts of his body. The bleeding Lakshmikanthan managed to garner enough strength to walk to the lawyer's house, who listened to his description of the incident, and then sent him to General Hospital, Madras in the company of his friend, Brew. On the way, Lakshmikanthan requested the rickshaw-driver to stop at Vepery police station to file a complaint against the assailants. At about that time, Brew took leave of him. Profusely bleeding and unable to move, Lakshmikanthan dictated his description of the incident while sitting in the rickshaw while inspector Krishnan Nambiyar wrote it down on a piece of paper. At the General Hospital, Lakshmikanthan was admitted to the Wenlock Ward when bleeding in the abdomen did not cease. In the ward, Dr. P. R. Balakrishnan inspected his abdomen to check whether there was a serious wound. After this inspection, Lakshmikanthan's condition reportedly grew serious and he died at 4:15 a.m. (IST) on 9 November 1944 due to secondary shock caused by damage to the kidney. The Indian Express reported that he was \\"aged about fifty\\" during the time of his death.  Arrests  On the day of the attack, the police arrested one Vadivelu. Six suspects were arrested in the days following the murder. Among them were Bhagavathar, Krishnan and Naidu. They were tried for the murder. Bhagavathar and Krishnan were convicted while Naidu was acquitted. The Madras High Court sentenced the duo to transportation for life. Krishnan and Bhagavathar appealed to the Privy Council. However, the appeal from the Privy Council did not come until the duo had already spent 30 months in jail.  Suspects = M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar  M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar (1909-1959) was one of the biggest stars of early Tamil cinema. With his trademark long hair and his sweet voice, he set long- standing movie records. He was appreciated for his generosity and was perhaps the only film actor to be awarded a \\"Rao Bahadur\\" title (which he refused). At the time of his arrest, Bhagavathar was at the peak of his success. He had just completed shooting for Haridas, which ran for three successful years at Sun Theatre in Broadway, Madras. He was the highest paid Tamil actor at the time and had been signed for as many as 12 films at the time of his arrest. N. S. Krishnan N. S. Krishnan was a Tamil film comedian, drama artist, playback singer and writer in the early stages of the Tamil film industry. He is considered as the \\"Charlie Chaplin of India.\\" He acted in nearly 150 Tamil films and the matinee-duo of Krishnan and T. A. Madhuram (later his wife) in Tamil films was very popular; he did roles along with leading stage and cine artists. He was also a talented singer. His jail term and fight for justice made him penurious; his wealth was lost in fighting the case.

His painting of Jesus, \\"Christ in Red Robe,\\"The name \\"Christ in Red Robe\\" is not to be confused with Minerva Teichert's \\"Christ in a Red Robe\\" (1945). () Parson's painting is called \\"Christ in Red Robe\\" by Deseret Book, a publisher of LDS Church materials. () It has also been referred to as \\"The Lord Jesus Christ\\", at Parson's online gallery. () It is also called \\"Jesus the Christ\\". () is recognizable from its wide use by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Biography Parson was born in Ogden, Utah and grew up in Rexburg, Idaho, where his father was an art professor at Ricks College. He is one of nine children, three of whom became professional artists. Parson attended Ricks College and later Brigham Young University (BYU), where he received a B.A. in Life Sciences in 1972 and a Master of Fine Arts in drawing and painting in 1975. Parson was a gallery and portrait artist before becoming a professor of art at Dixie College in 1988. There he was awarded the Teaching Excellence Award from the Utah College Council in 1990. After the death of his wife, Joycel, and youngest daughter in a 1978 car accident, Parson felt inspired to begin painting primarily religious subjects. In 1983, he was commissioned by the LDS Church to paint \\"Christ in Red Robe,\\" his first portrait of Jesus, which has since been used in many church materials. This portrait is the subject of popular Mormon folklore, with claims that Parson produced the work under the direction of church general authorities, who suggested how to make it more accurate, until it was deemed the closest resemblance of Jesus Christ. Parson denies this, stating the work's commission and revisions were according to the needs of the church curriculum department. In April 2011, the biographical film \\"Del Parson: Portraits of Love\\" premiered on BYUtv. Parson lives in Cedar City, Utah with his wife, Lynette, and has six children. Artistic work Parson is a traditional realist artist and creates mostly Latter-day Saint art, but also works on other themes, such as landscapes. The LDS Church has commissioned Parson to paint over 240 works, many of which are of Jesus Christ. One painting in particular, of the resurrected Christ exiting the tomb, is found in many the church's meetinghouses and homes of its members. Parson has received regional and national awards for his work. His work has been displayed at the Allied Artists of America, National Academy of Design, Knickerbocker Artist, American Artists Professional League, the Amarillo Rotary Show, the Springville Museum of Art, the Morrison-Knudsen corporate headquarters, the Church History Museum, and the National Center for Constitutional Studies. His work has been the sole subject of exhibits at Dixie State University, BYU, BYU Idaho, the Las Vegas Art Museum, and the James M. Haney Art Gallery in Amarillo, Texas.

He performed a wide repertoire that encompassed French grand opera, Italian bel canto opera, the German operas of Richard Wagner, and the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He possessed a deep resonant voice which remained clear until the very end of his career when his intonation began to suffer somewhat. After retiring from the stage in 1893, he became a much celebrated singing teacher at the Vienna Conservatory and many of his pupils went on to have highly successful opera careers. Life and career Hans Freiherr von Rokitansky was born in Vienna, the son of Baron Carl von Rokitansky who was a famous physician and natural scientist. Hans's younger brother Baron Victor von Rokitansky (1836‚Äì1896), also became a successful opera singer and a composer. He later married Therese Lablache, a soprano and the daughter of the famous operatic bass Luigi Lablache. Rokitansky studied music in Paris, Bologna, and Milan before making his professional singing d√©but in an 1856 concert in London. The following year he made his first appearance on the operatic stage as Oroveso in Bellini's Norma at the Th√©√¢tre Italien in Paris. In 1862 he joined the roster at the National Theatre in Prague where his first role was Cardinal Brogny in Fromental Hal√©vy's La Juive. He left Prague in 1864 to join the Vienna Hofoper where he sang roles for the next twenty-nine years. His many roles at that house included Giorgio in Bellini's I puritani, Leporello in Mozart's Don Giovanni, Sarastro in Mozart's The Magic Flute, Bertram in Meyerbeer's Robert le diable, the title role in Verdi's Fiesco, Caspar in Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz, the Landgrave in Wagner's Tannh√§user, and King Henry in Wagner's Lohengrin among others. He also notably portrayed both the High priest and the Guardian of the temple in the world premiere of Karl Goldmark's Die K√∂nigin von Saba in 1875.Elizabeth Forbes: \\"Hans Freiherr von Rokitansky\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 2 February 2009), (subscription access) In addition to performing in Vienna, Rokitansky periodically performed in operas and concerts in throughout Europe. He appeared in operas at Her Majesty's Theatre in London in 1865 and in 1866, notably singing Osmin in a revival of Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail. He also appeared in London performances in 1876-1877 and appeared in operas in Florence, Milan, Turin, and Bologna during the 1860s and 1870s.Biography of Hans von Rokitansky on Operissimo.com (in German). Accessed 2 February 2009. After leaving the Vienna Hofoper in 1893, Rokitansky taught singing at the Vienna Conservatory for more than a decade. His younger brother Victor, also a successful opera singer and a composer, had taught at the conservatory previously from 1871 through 1880. Several of Hans's students went on to have successful opera careers, including Franz Xaver Battisti and Therese Boschetti. Hans retired to Schloss Laubegg, Styria where he died on 2 November 1909.

A cerebrospinal fluid leak can be either cranial or spinal, and these are two different disorders. A spinal CSF leak can be caused by one or more meningeal diverticula or CSF-venous fistulas not associated with an epidural leak. CSF leaks are either caused by trauma including that arising from medical interventions, or have no known cause known as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks (sCSF leaks). Traumatic causes include a lumbar puncture noted by a post-dural-puncture headache, and other trauma such as from a fall or accident. Spontaneous CSF leaks are associated with heritable connective tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome and Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndromes. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of a CSF leak is a fast-onset, extremely painful orthostatic headache or thunderclap headache. A spinal leak may cause spontaneous intracranial hypotension (low CSF pressure) because the body cannot replenish the CSF fast enough to keep pace with the leak. As a result, the brain may sag inside the skull and into the foramen magnum, which is visible (and measurable) with an MRI of the brain. A cranial leak is more likely to cause intracranial hypertension (high CSF pressure), which carries a risk of meningitis. Both a cranial and spinal leak can fluctuate between high and low CSF pressure. While high CSF pressure can make lying down unbearable, low CSF pressure due to a leak can be relieved by lying flat on the back. Other symptoms of a CSF leak can include neck pain, photophobia, dizziness, gait disturbances, tinnitus, visual disturbances, brain fog, nausea, fluid dripping from the nose or ears, and a metallic taste in the mouth. An untreated CSF leak can result in coma or death. Movement disorders are uncommon in spontaneous CSF leaks but occasionally can be one of the major components of the clinical presentation. Causes A cerebrospinal fluid leak can be a rare complication of an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). One study suggested a CSF leak to follow from 0.5% of operations. Another study suggests a CSF leak to follow from 1% of operations. In most of these cases repair is successful. Diagnosis CSF leaks are frequently misdiagnosed as migraine, Chiari malformation, dysautonomia or conversion disorder. Routine imaging assessment uses contrast-enhanced brain MRI with sagittal reformats. : Imaging can assess for the following: * Subdural fluid collections * Enhancement of the meninges * Engorgement of venous structures * Pituitary swelling * Sagging of the brain For suspected spinal CSF leaks, spine imaging can be used to guide treatment. Other imaging can be helpful in diagnosing a CSF leak, and in identifying its location, typically using a CT scan or an MRI scan. A myelogram can be used to more precisely identify the location of a CSF leak by injecting a dye to further enhance the imaging. However, CSF leaks are frequently not visible on imaging. For patients with recalcitrant spontaneous intracranial hypotension and no leak found on conventional spinal imaging, digital subtraction myelography, CT myelography and dynamic myelography (a modified conventional myelography technique) should be considered to rule out a CSF-venous fistula. In addition, presence of a hyperdense paraspinal vein should be investigated in imaging as it is highly suggestive of a CSF venous fistula. Fluid dripping from the nose (CSF rhinorrhoea) or ears (CSF otorrhea) should be collected and tested for the protein Beta-2 transferrin which would be highly accurate in identifying CS fluid and diagnosing a cranial CSF leak. Treatment Symptomatic treatment usually involves analgesics for both cranial and spinal CSF leaks. Caffeine and short-term bed rest can alleviate symptoms of low CSF pressure, while elevated rest and acetazolamide can alleviate symptoms of high CSF pressure. Sometimes a CSF leak will heal on its own. Otherwise, symptoms may last months or even years. An epidural blood patch is the typical treatment for a CSF leak, where up to 20 cubic centimeters of the patient's blood is drawn, then injected into either the lumbar or cervical spine, close to the known or suspected site of the leak. Fibrin glue patching is an alternative where blood patching is unsuccessful. If the site of the leak is known, neurosurgical repair of the dura mater is an option. Surgery to treat a CSF-venous fistula in CSF leak patients is highly effective. The use of antibiotics to prevent meningitis in those with a CSF leak due to a skull fracture is of unclear benefit.

The primary form of company is the public company or Aktiengesellschaft (AG). A private company with limited liability is known as a Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung (GmbH). A partnership is called a Kommanditgesellschaft (KG). History In Germany, through most of the 19th century the Kommanditgesellschaft (soci√©t√© en commandite in France) was the typical form of business organisation. A \\"KG\\" had at least one member with unlimited liability, but other investors' liability was limited to their contribution. A special concession was not required for setting up this company. The first German public company statute was the Prussian Act of 1794. In 1861 the Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch or the General Commercial Code for all of Germany, as well as Austria, was enacted, which devoted a section to joint stock companies. This allowed incorporation with limited liability. Companies would be constituted with a single board of directors, though they had the option of a two-tiered board system, involving shareholders appointing a supervisory board, which could in turn elect the management board.Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch ¬ß225 There were updates to the Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch in the Aktiennovelle von 1870 (New Company Act 1870)C Windbichler, Gesellschaftsrecht (22nd ed. Beck 2009) 298, stating the law was concerned mostly with formal requirements for company structures. The following \\"Gr√ºnderzeit\\" (period of company foundations) saw a lot of abuse since there were few protections for shareholders or creditors over how their money was used. and again in 1884.On the latter, see Gesetz betreffend die Kommenditgesellschaften auf Aktien und die Aktiengesellschaften (AktG) v. 31.7.1884 (RGBl. S. 123-70), which served as a model in Japan The 1884 reform mandated that companies have a two-tier board, with the justification that free registration rather than a system of state concession meant a supervisory board was needed to take over the state's monitoring role.See Handelsgesetzbuch ¬ß209; and see P Hommelhoff and W Schubert, Hundert Jahre Modernes Aktienrecht (1985); KJ Hopt, 'Zur Funktion des Aufsichtsrats im Verh√§ltnis von Industrie und Bankensystem' or 'Law and the Formation of the Big Enterprises in the 19th and 20th Centuries' in N Horn & J Kocka (eds) (1979) 227 The members of the supervisory board were not allowed to serve on the management board. However, shareholders could still directly elect management board members if they so wished.Handelsgesetzbuch ¬ß 236 Further reforms led to the Handelsgesetzbuch of 1897, but without changing the basic structure.C Windbichler, Gesellschaftsrecht (22nd ed. Beck 2009) 299 Aktiengesellschaft=Shareholder rights Shareholders have a list of specific rights allocated to them by the Aktiengesetz, although this is circumscribed by the general principle in AktG ¬ß119(2) that issues concerning ‚Äòbusiness leadership‚Äô can only be determined by the executive directors. The voting rights of shareholders are heavily influenced by the banks. Banks appropriate the votes of people who must deposit their share certificates in banks‚Äô accounts. The notable rights for shareholders are as follows *the right to vote, with one share one vote. Preferential shares without voting rights can, however, be issued. *to call a meeting with 20% of the votes, AktG ¬ß122 *a non-binding say on pay, AktG ¬ß120 *changes to the constitution by a three quarter majority, AktG ¬ß179 *the right to vote or veto ‚Äòsubstantial‚Äô property transactions. There is no fixed percentage for this doctrine, which was developed by the courts, but it will be triggered if the management attempts to sell off assets that compose a large or important part of the business, Holzm√ºller (1982) BGHZ 83, 122.The Bundesgerichtshof held that shareholders must approve a sale of assets amounting to 80% of the company's value. *the use of profits from the accounts, AktG ¬ß119(1)(ii) *appointment of auditors, AktG ¬ß119(1)(iv and vii) *raising or reducing capital, AktG ¬ß119(1)(vi) *winding up, AktG ¬ß119(1)(viii) There is no right to control political donations (cf AktG ¬ß58). Directors‚Äô duties German directors have similar duties to most jurisdictions, primarily a duty of loyalty, and a duty to exercise competent judgment. First, the duty of loyalty, or Treuepflicht, derives from the good faith provision in the civil code (BGB ¬ß242). Second, there is a particular prohibition on taking corporate opportunities and a duty of secrecy, AktG ¬ß93(1). Third, there is a specific prohibition on competing with the company, AktG ¬ß88. Fourth, recently introduced was a ‚Äòbusiness judgment rule‚Äô. A new provision, AktG ¬ß93(1) says, ‚Äòexecutive members have to exercise the care of an ordinary and conscientious business leader‚Äô. Derivative litigation While German corporate theory posits that the supervisory board should do the work of protecting minority shareholders, and is expected to do the litigating against the executive (AktG ¬ß111), minority shareholders may also bring claims against directors. Under AktG ¬ß147, ten per cent of shareholders, or those with over ‚Ç¨1,000,000 may bring a claim against a director for breach of duty. They will have a special representative appointed to carry out the litigation and the company will pay the costs. There is also a procedure for one per cent of shareholders, or those with an interest over ‚Ç¨100,000 to bring a claim (AktG ¬ß148). Here the court is more stringent, and like the derivative claim in the UK can strike out an application if it finds reasons for it are lacking. There have been cases where the courts have held that majority shareholders owe a duty of good faith to minority shareholders, but also that minorities who can block actions by the company owe duties to the majority. Corporate governance Analogous to the UK Corporate Governance Code, which is also a ‚Äòcomply or explain‚Äô law, is the Deutsche Corporate Governance Kodex (AktG ¬ß161). It replicates a lot of rules already found in the Aktiengesetz. *AktG ¬ß87, requires that pay for the executive is set by the supervisory board. In 2009, this was amended so that (1) pay could not exceed the normal level without special justifications, and (2) if performance had deteriorated, executive pay could be reduced to an equitable level. *AtkG ¬ß120(4) was added so that the general meeting of shareholders (not employees!) have a non-binding say on pay. *AktG ¬ß113 says that the pay for supervisory board members can either be fixed by the company constitution, and changed by ordinary majority vote, or be determined on a resolution of the shareholders. *AktG ¬ß119(1)(iv and vii) auditors are appointed by the shareholders. Apart from that the supervisory board should also have an audit committee, which handles the audit business. Employees Under the Mitbestimmungsgesetz, in companies with over 2000 workers just under half the seats on a supervisory board are selected by the workers. In companies with over 500 staff one third of the supervisory must be composed of employee directors under the Drittelbeteiligungsgesetz. With under 500 staff, there is no automatic right of employees to board representation. However, any workplace with over five people allow workers various rights through elected works councils, and if the business has over 20 staff, employees may force the management into arbitration over redundancies. Directors A large German company is required to have a two tier board system. The basic difference to the law, for instance, in the UK, Sweden or the US, is that an executive directors cannot be removed directly by the members of the company (i.e. shareholders typically, and sometimes employees) but only by a second tier \\"supervisory\\" board. The Aktiengesetz ¬ß76 the executive's primary role is to manage the company, or look after its day-to- day affairs. By contrast under Aktiengesetz ¬ß111 the supervisory board's role is stated to be to \\"supervise\\" (√ºberwachen). Originally a supervisory board was a default requirement, so companies could choose whether to have one or not. The practice became utilised in most companies by the 1920s, however in the Aktiengesetz 1937, German law made it a requirement to have a supervisory board. This remained in the post-war reforms. Members of the executive (\\"Vorstand\\", often translated as ‚Äòmanagement board‚Äô) are generally appointed for five years. They can be removed by the supervisory board, but only for a \\"good reason\\" (AktG ¬ß84(3) ein wichtiger Grund). This includes a vote of no confidence by the shareholders. However, the supervisory board is not bound to act upon a shareholder vote. Within the executive although all members will generally be appointed by the supervisory board, in companies with over 2000 people there must be one ‚Äòstaff director‚Äô, Arbeitsdirektor, on the executive who is intended to hold the confidence of the employees, under Mitbestimmungsgesetz 1976 ¬ß33. Typically this will mean that staff director is nominated by the unions, though no formal procedure is prescribed. In companies with over 2000 employees, the supervisory board (\\"Aufsichtsrat\\") is composed of half shareholder appointees (Aktiengesetz ¬ß¬ß102 and 119) who can only remove the supervisory board members on a 75% vote (AktG ¬ß¬ß102-103). The other half is elected by the employees, though in companies with over 8000 employees the employees can let the unions vote on their behalf (Mitbestimmungsgesetz ¬ß¬ß7 and 9). However, one chairperson with the casting vote invariably is chosen by shareholders. Initially both the shareholder and employee sides are meant to reach a consensus on the chair. If they cannot reach consensus, it will go to arbitration, and if a solution is still not reached, the shareholders get to choose (Mitbestimmungsgesetz ¬ß27).

He became the witness to an attack by a local sultan on Erskine Murray's yacht Young Queen, captained by Captain Hait, and the brig Anne, captained by Captain Lewis. The account was documented in a letter to one Honorable E. Murray and published in the Sydney Shipping Gazette. Kema incident According to accounts by the crew, on 24 February 1844, Cyrus anchored at Kema Roads, Celebes, with a valuable cargo of whale oil. The next day the crew went ashore, but returned a few men short. Two men, Heron and Robson, were spotted and told to return but fled after they were confronted only to return later on the 28th. Crew members Howland and Heron went missing on 2 March. Finally on 3 March, after much searching and drunken antics by her crew on the Dutch occupied island, Cyrus sailed away to return to England, but without the missing crew members.The Times, 13 September 1844 Upon returning to Great Britain in August 1844, the crew was summoned to a hearing by William Heron's mother. The incident had not been well documented and there was not enough evidence to suggest one way or the other if Captain Spratly was guilty of abandoning them without a thorough search, therefore no jury trial followed. The account given by the newspapers was starkly different from the crew's accounts recorded by the courts and gave more details of the course of events.The Times, 21 September 1844  Crew  Circa. 1838‚Äì1844 * Captain Richard Spratly, Master * Chief Officer George Cotton * Second Officer William Spratly * Francis Rankin, Surgeon * William Heron, Cooper's Mate (abandoned in Keimes, Celebes 1841) * Mr Howland (abandoned in Keimes, Celebes 1841) * Mr Robson * Mr Brown * George Lansdell Contributions to navigational knowledge Captain Spratly occasionally submitted navigational routes and survey information to The Nautical Magazine and the Naval Chronicles.

Background Bessemer, a severe seasickness sufferer, devised in 1868 the idea of a ship whose passenger cabin - the Saloon - would be suspended on gimbals and kept horizontal mechanically to isolate the occupants from the ship's motion: an idea he patented in December 1869. After successful trials with a model, the levelling achieved by hydraulics controlled by a steersman watching a spirit level, Bessemer set up a limited joint stock company, the Saloon Ship Company, to run steamships between England and France. This gained ¬£250,000 capital, financing the construction of a ship, the SS Bessemer, with the naval constructor Edward James Reed as chief designer.The Bessemer Saloon Steam-Ship, Chapter XX, Sir Henry Bessemer, F.R.S., An Autobiography Construction Bessemer was a 4-paddle steamer (2 paddles each on port and starboard, one fore, one aft), length , breadth at deck beam , outside breadth across paddle-boxes, , draught , gross register tonnage 1974 tons. The internal Saloon was a room by , with a ceiling from the floor, Morocco-covered seats, divisions and spiral columns of carved oak, and gilt moulded panels with hand-painted murals. Bessemer was built by Earle's Shipbuilding of Hull. She was yard number 197 and was launched on 24 September 1874. Career The ship sailed from Dover to Calais on a private trial in April 1875. On arrival, it sustained damage to a paddle-wheel when it hit the pier at Calais, due to its failure to answer to the helm at slow speed. The first and only public voyage took place on 8 May 1875, the ship sailing with the swinging cabin locked (some observers suggested due to its serious instability.,Short Works of Percy Hethrington Fitzgerald, Percy Hethrington Fitzgerald, BiblioBazaar, 2008, although Bessemer ascribed it to insufficient time to fix the previous damage). The ship was operated by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. After two attempts to enter the harbour, it crashed into the Calais pier again, this time demolishing part of it. The poor performance lost the confidence of investors, leading to the winding-up of the Saloon Ship Company in 1876. The ship remained in dock at Dover until being sold for scrap in 1879. When the ship was broken up, its designer Reed had the Saloon cabin moved to his home, Hextable House, Swanley,County Agricultural Surveys, Royal Agricultural Society of England, 1954 where it was used as a billiard room.Boat Trains and Channel Packets: The English Short Sea Routes, Rixon Bucknall, V. Stuart, 1957 When the house later became a women's college, Swanley Agricultural College, the Saloon was used as a lecture hall, but was destroyed by a direct hit when the college was bombed in World War II.The Story of the Paddle Steamer, Bernard Dumpleton, Intellect Books, 2002, The sole remaining parts of the ship are three carved wooden decorative panels from the saloon that were rescued from the wreckage after the bombing. One panel was valued on the Antiques Roadshow at between ¬£300 - 400 in 2012. References Primary reference: The Bessemer Saloon Steam-Ship, Chapter XX, Sir Henry Bessemer, F.R.S.

Amy Goskirk Amy Goskirk is an ex-girlfriend of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) who follows him to Weatherfield from Birmingham. Dev is not pleased to see her and is hostile, even physically evicting her from his shop. Spotted crying by her car by Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden), he takes her for a drink in The Rovers where she overhears landlady Natalie Barnes (Denise Welch) talking about the need to employ another barmaid and Natalie offers her a job after learning of her experience. Amy works hard to get the sympathy of the residents, much to the disdain of Dev. Everyone takes Amy's side when she says that she and Dev were engaged to be married but his devoutly religious family were against their relationship. In addition, she claims that he cheated on her and now she is pregnant. Dev calls her bluff and agrees to marry her on condition that she proves the existence of the baby. She happily agrees but then claims that her scan was cancelled. No one but Dev is able to see through her lies. Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) provides a sympathetic shoulder for Amy to cry on when they share their troubles with each other, Leanne confiding in Amy about her drug problems and Amy telling of her parents‚Äô death in a boating accident when she was a child (she told Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) it was a car accident). Amy winds up Leanne by telling her that Dev is forcing her to have an abortion and Leanne, in her anger, turns the majority of the women and some of the men, against Dev. Amy suddenly disappears for almost two weeks, leaving behind a suicide note. Leanne reports her disappearance to the police, who ask Dev to identify a recently discovered body. It is not Amy but even his conviction that the threat was an empty one is shaken. His relief when she reappears, complete with bandaged wrists from an attempt to cut her wrists is evident; however, his business starts to suffer as people begin to turn against him even more. He resolves to put an end to the situation and cons Amy into thinking that he really does have feelings for her. He turns up in the Rovers that night and, while chatting quietly to her under the glaring eyes of the regulars, suddenly rips her bandages off for all to see that, as he suspected, there are no wounds. The residents are outraged that they‚Äôd been deceived, Leanne in particular, but all she gets for her sympathy is a mouthful of abuse and the fact that she is a recovering drug addict broadcast across the pub. Amy disappears from the Street, never to be seen again. Debs Brownlow Debs Brownlow is the hairdresser sister of Natalie Barnes (Denise Welch) who first appears in The Rovers Return after working on a cruise ship for a number of years.

Debs supports Natalie when the body of her murdered son Tony Horrocks (Lee Warburton) is discovered, and subsequently in August 2000 when gangster Jez Quigley (Lee Boardman) stands trial for the killing. Debs soon tires of Duggie's reluctance to have sex with her and has a one-night stand with Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) in April 2000. Debs reunites with Duggie and they consummate their union. In October 2000, Duggie moves into No. 6 with her but she soon tires of him prioritising work over her and she orders him out. When Debs shares her relationship woes with Natalie's boyfriend Vinny Sorrell (James Gaddas) over a bottle of wine they sleep together. Duggie catches them in the act and tells a devastated Natalie. She throws Debs out of No. 6 and she subsequently leaves Weatherfield with new lover Vinny, returning to her old work on the cruise ship. Dennis Stringer Dennis Stringer was played by Charles Dale.

She was soon seduced by handsome former prison convict, Joe Carter (Jonathan Wrather), and the two enjoyed a fun relationship until a jealous Dev goaded Joe into beating him up. Joe was scared of going back to prison and admitted he loved Geena. By this time, she had completely fallen in love with him and agreed to talk to Dev. He then told Joe to end his relationship with Geena publicly and he would drop the assault charges against him. Joe did so and Geena was left shattered and humiliated by two men who claimed to love her and fled the street after saying her goodbyes to her friend, Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay). Dr. Wilson Dr. Wilson was called in by Gail Platt (Helen Worth) as her thirteen-year-old daughter Sarah- Louise (Tina O'Brien) began getting sick after she refused to eat, and was concerned she might be developing an eating disorder. However, when the doctor examined the young girl, she told the shocked mother and daughter she was pregnant. Dr. Wilson told Gail that Sarah was too far along to have an abortion and that social services will have to be called in. Lydia Summers (Alison Darling) was informed by Dr. Wilson of Sarah's pregnancy and she came over to 8 Coronation Street to discuss the situation. Lydia Summers Lydia Summers, portrayed by Alison Darling, was a social worker who visited the Platt family to support Sarah-Louise (Tina O'Brien) and her family in relation to Sarah's pregnancy. Dr. Wilson had informed Gail (Helen Worth) that social services will be visiting. Lydia came to 8 Coronation Street in the middle of a row with Sarah, Gail, and Sarah's adoptive father Martin (Sean Wilson), who was under suspicion of being the baby's father. This angered Martin as Lydia asked Gail about her working hours at Roy Cropper's (David Neilson) caf√© and how long he stayed at home with the children. She also had a private chat with Sarah in her bedroom and encouraged her to tell her who the father of her baby is, which she was reluctant to do so and didn‚Äôt reveal his name. When Lydia asks Sarah how she feels about the baby she told her how she felt scared, but Lydia reassured that Sarah was. not on her own. Neil Fearns Neil Fearns is revealed as the father of Sarah-Louise Platt's (Tina O'Brien) daughter, Bethany (Amy and Emily Walton). He is an \\"absent father\\" and has nothing to do with Bethany, although his family do send a card for her first birthday. In 2003, it is revealed that Neil has died in a car accident. Martin (Sean Wilson) and Gail Platt (Helen Worth) break the news to Sarah, who is shocked at Neil's death but not overly emotional. At Martin's insistence, Sarah takes Bethany to Neil's funeral where she meets his mother. Neil's mother, Brenda (Julia Deakin), becomes mentally unstable, following Neil's death. She becomes attached to granddaughter Bethany and kidnaps her after she begins visiting her regularly. Bethany is later safely returned to her mother, and Brenda is left sobbing in the back of an ambulance. Mrs. Paton Mrs. Paton, portrayed by Janice McKenzie, was a head teacher at Weatherfield Comprehensive, and was informed of Sarah-Louise Platt's (Tina O'Brien) pregnancy. She assured Sarah and her concerned parents that Sarah will receive support from the school staff, which Martin was apprehensive about as he didn't want the baby's father Neil Fearns (Paul Holowaty) to be involved. Mrs. Paton then informed Sarah a week later that the school staff were wanting her to take a job backstage for the production of Grease. Kirsten Grant Kirsten Grant, portrayed by Vicky Connett, was one of the pupils who stirred at Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien) when there were rumours that she was pregnant. She bullied her along with some other pupils when they put a baby doll in her locker and called her names but her best mate, Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson), stood up for her. At a school dance, Kirsten apologised to Sarah for her past behaviour (Candice previously mentioned to Sarah that Kirsten has since changed). When Sarah saw Candice and Kirsten dancing with some boys, she realised that because of her pregnancy, she didn't fit in with the crowd anymore. Marion Stowe Marion Stowe, portrayed by Paula Simms, is the mother of Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson), who usually led her best mate Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien) astray. Oblivious to Candice's bad behavior, Marion disapproved of Sarah, especially when she discovered the young girl was expecting a baby at the age of just thirteen. She demanded Sarah to stay away from her daughter, causing Sarah's mother Gail (Helen Worth) to angrily turn up on her doorstep and give her a piece of her mind before the door was slammed in her face. Five months later, Marion gate crashed Sarah's daughter Bethany's (Amy and Emily Walton) christening party as she was furious with her daughter for going to such a \\"charade\\" when she had forbidden her to go. She insulted the party guests, Sarah, and vicar Jessica Lundy (Olwen May), who also gave her a piece of her mind. She physically dragged Candice from the house, and had a row with Gail and Sarah's adoptive father Martin (Sean Wilson) outside the front yard. Almost a year later, Marion turned up at the Platt house again and dragged Candice away as she didn't want her to go on a camping trip with the family, afraid that her daughter might also end up pregnant as Candice's then boyfriend Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) was also tagging along. In the winter of 2001, Candice's troublecausing was finally revealed when Gail found expensive shopping in Sarah's bedroom, and Sarah told her the items belonged to Candice. Candice tried to put the blame on Sarah until Sarah revealed that Candice had gotten an evening job in a factory, which is how she got the clothes in the first place, and that Candice had convinced Sarah into letting her copy her homework. Marion finally realized the extent of her daughter's bad behavior, and angrily had a row with her and dragged her out of the Platt house. In late August 2003, Marion showed selfishness when she began dating Gerry Burton (Mark Chatterton), and didn't believe her daughter's claims that Gerry was sexually harassing her. This caused Candice to sleep in the flat above Audrey Roberts' (Sue Nicholls) hair salon, and Audrey took pity on her when she discovered the girl's problems. Marion tried to get her daughter to come home, but when Candice refused, it was very clear that Marion would choose her boyfriend over her daughter when she gave Candice a bag of her belongings. Audrey sent Marion away with a flea in her ear, and Candice and her mother never made up since then. Whenever Candice would mention her mother, it was very clear she used to have a good relationship with her. However, Marion would always give Sarah negative comments, such as telling her it was \\"bad luck\\" to buy things before the baby was born, and also making Sarah emotionally offended when Candice mentioned to Sarah she wasn't allowed to bring boys up to her bedroom anymore. Marion was referred to as just \\"Mrs. Stowe\\" in end credits, but on her last appearance, her full name was credited. Mr. Fearns Mr. Fearns is the father of Neil Fearns (Paul Holowaty) who impregnates Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien) when they are 12 years old. He offers the Platt family help with the baby, which Sarah's mother Gail (Helen Worth) refuses as Neil is not willing to take responsibility for the child. He makes his only appearance just over two months before Sarah's baby is born. Following Neil's death, it is revealed that Mr. Fearns had left his wife Brenda for a \\"younger model\\". Emma Watts Emma Watts (also Taylor) is played by Angela Lonsdale, and first appears on 10 April 2000. At the beginning she is credited as Sgt Emma Taylor. She is a police officer who helps solve the case when corrupt DC Simon Cavanagh is stalking Colette Graham and Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy).

When they eventually burst in, Emma shoots the main gunman, Dean Sykes (Ciar√°n Griffiths)‚Äîwho dies in an ambulance on the way to hospital. Due to her licence to kill, a trial is not undertaken. Dean had in fact fired a shot and Emma had responded. Curly takes her out for a night on the beach and later asks her out to dinner. Curly proposes to Emma on a bateau mouche in Paris and they marry on Christmas Eve, 2000. Their honeymoon to New York is delayed because Curly's daughter, Alice, cannot return to his ex-wife Raquel (Sarah Lancashire) when planned. Emma becomes pregnant shortly after their marriage and gives birth to their son Ben on Boxing Day 2001. Emma later gets involved in a feud between one of her colleagues, Mick Hopwood (Ian Gain) and Les Battersby (Bruce Jones). Mick had been dating Les' ex-wife Janice (Vicky Entwistle). Les is very jealous and they spend a lot of time winding each other up. Things escalate one night when Mick and Emma stop Les in his taxi on a minor traffic offence and after Les insults Mick, Mick beats him quite savagely but Emma promises to back Mick up even though Les did not really deserve the attack. When Curly finds out, this causes a lot of tension and the couple split up temporarily. Emma feels very guilty and plans to confess the truth to her superiors but at the last minute decides to back Mick up. She commits perjury at Les' trial for assaulting Mick and Les is wrongfully imprisoned for three months. Near the end of Les' wrongful incarceration, Emma is put forward for promotion to Inspector in Newcastle. This would involve moving house and Curly is afraid he'd never see Ben. He swallows his principles and, in order to reconcile and be able to live in peace, away from Les, they put Number 7 on the market and move to Newcastle.

When Jenny had her son christened, it inspired Sarah to give her daughter Bethany (Amy and Emily Walton) a christening of her own. Her best friend Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson) wanted Jenny to be godmother alongside Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) as her mother Marion (Paula Simms) had forbidden her to go to the christening as she disapproved of Sarah, but Candice managed to sneak out with her then boyfriend Darren Michaels (Bruno Langley), and get angrily dragged out of the house by an embarrassing Marion.

As Jenny held Josh, she and Sarah comforted Candice, who went out with the much older Vikram Desai (Chris Bisson) and felt embarrassed when he discovered her real age. Josh and Jenny attended Bethany's first birthday party and Jenny met Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell). Kevin lost his wife and baby son, Alison (Naomi Radcliffe) and Jake, the previous year. He was devastated when he heard Josh's name as it was similar to his dead son's name. Glen Middleham Glen Middleham, portrayed by Will Haigh, was a short-term boyfriend of Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien). Sarah and Glen first met at the pictures, and they got on well although Sarah didn't mention she was a teenage mother to a baby daughter named Bethany (Amy and Emily Walton). Her and Glen then went bowling, and it ended well with a kiss. Much to her best mate Candice Stowe's (Nikki Sanderson) disgust, Sarah kept Bethany hidden from Glen, afraid he might not want to date her; she even pretended that Bethany was Hayley Cropper's (Julie Hesmondhalgh) daughter and was babysitting, but Glen would discover that Bethany is, in fact, Sarah's daughter when Sarah's adoptive father Martin (Sean Wilson) caught the two alone at home and revealed all to Glen. Glen left the house angry and confused. On New Year's Day 2001, Glen came back and Sarah explained everything to him, so they got back together, but Sarah was having suspicions that Glen was only using her for sex, and she confided in Candice about it. Sarah's suspicions were right when Candice confronted her about her and Glen having sex on New Year's Day, which really didn't happen, and Sarah dumped Glen when she discovered he had started the rumors. Molly Hardcastle Molly Hardcastle was played by Jacqueline Kington. She first appears as the new practice nurse in the medical centre on Rosamund Street. She goes on to have a relationship with Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) who is estranged from wife Sally (Sally Dynevor). She leaves Weatherfield after breaking up with Kevin in May 2002. She was last mentioned in November 2009 by Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) to his wife also called Molly (Vicky Binns), while listing all of Kevin's relationships with women. Unbeknownst to Tyrone, his wife had just started an affair with Kevin. Upon hearing about his previous affairs behind Sally's back, Molly Dobbs confronted Kevin, making particular reference to the fact she was not the first woman called Molly he had been with. Matt Ramsden Matthew \\"Matt\\" Ramsden and his alcoholic schoolteacher wife Charlie (Clare McGlinn) moved to Coronation Street when the new Medical Centre on Rosamund Street opened its doors and Matt got a job there as a GP. Matt is the biological father of Joshua Peacock (Benjamin Beresford), after having a drunken one-night stand with Ashley Peacock's (Steven Arnold) wife, Maxine (Tracy Shaw). Matt left Weatherfield when Joshua was only a week old in an attempt to rebuild his and Charlie's marriage. Maxine was murdered in January 2003, leaving Ashley to raise Joshua. In 2006, Matt reappeared with a new wife seeking access to his estranged son. Ashley went to court to stop Matt seeing Joshua, but at the last minute, decided to grant Matt limited visitation rights so that the judge would not make the decision. On Matt's first visit, Ashley's wife Claire Peacock (Julia Haworth) went into labour, and Matt helped her deliver her baby son on the living room couch. After the birth of Freddie, Ashley thanks Matt, but reminds him that this does not change anything. Matt has not been seen since but has been referred to subsequently, often visiting Joshua and taking him out, off-screen. Charlie Ramsden Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Ramsden (also Johnson and Hargreaves) was the wife of Matt Ramsden (Stephen Beckett), played by actress Clare McGlinn from 2000 to 2002. Charlie arrives in Weatherfield with her husband Matt in November 2000, having bought Natalie Barnes' (Denise Welch) house. She is first seen breaking up a fight between Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien) and David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), and Sarah recognises her as her English teacher at school. Charlie does not properly settle in Weatherfield due to her snobbish attitude and also due to the fact that most of the teenage residents were her students. She makes friends with Emma Watts (Angela Lonsdale), but takes an instant dislike to Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw). It soon becomes apparent that Charlie is an alcoholic, due in part to the fact that she had been given up for adoption as a child. Charlie tracked down her birth mother and was horrified to discover a student of hers, Luke Ashton, was her half- brother. Her marriage to Matt becomes increasingly rocky during their time in Weatherfield as a result of Charlie's alcoholism. Matt wants to have a family but Charlie does not, and when she becomes pregnant she immediately books an abortion. She confides in Emma and Maxine about this, leading Maxine to warn Matt before she goes through with the procedure. Matt tries desperately to stop Charlie going ahead with the abortion, but she does anyway. Maxine then comforts a distraught Matt, leading to her revealing that he might be the father of her unborn child. When Charlie returns home from the abortion clinic Matt reveals Maxine's news to her. Charlie is devastated to learn of the couple's one-night stand and walks out on Matt. Charlie takes the news badly and continues drinking heavily, even at work and as a result is suspended from her job. Charlie then agrees to give Matt another chance on condition that they leave the area for a fresh start. The Ramsdens pack their bags and leave in the middle of the night. In 2006, Matt returns to Weatherfield, wanting access to Joshua and is married to a woman called Sylvia, indicating that he and Charlie had split up and divorced in the intervening years. Wayne Hayes Wayne Hayes is a young teenager who is first seen breaking into Roy's Rolls caf√© in search of food. Roy Cropper (David Neilson) later sees Wayne in the building yard and invites him in for some food. Roy and his wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) discover that he lives in a children's home, but has run away from his mother, Sheila's, where he was to spend Christmas. Roy later witnesses Sheila's boyfriend, Alex Swinton, hitting Wayne and they are unhappy about bringing him back to the children's home as he is evidently unhappy there. Roy and Hayley grow close to Wayne and harbour hopes of fostering him, despite the presence of troublemaker Alex. Their application for fostering is approved in January 2001. In June 2001, Hayley bumps into Wayne and Sheila. It soon emerges that Alex is still hitting Wayne. When the social workers get involved, both Wayne and Sheila are forced to lie that no abuse is taking place. When Alex later offers Wayne to Roy and Hayley in exchange for ¬£10,000, Roy agrees to pay him, as they fear for Wayne's safety. Sheila decides that it would be best for Wayne to stay with Roy and Hayley even after finding out about the deal. When Alex starts to demand more money for Wayne, Roy and Hayley soon realise that they are backed into a corner as they do not have legal custody of Wayne. In July 2001, they decide that they need to get Wayne away from Alex for good and the three go on the run in Martin Platt's (Sean Wilson) car. Events become serious when the media begin reporting that the Croppers have kidnapped Wayne. Amidst the media frenzy, the trio stay with an old friend of Hayley's, Ruth Audsley, in the countryside. Eventually, Ruth informs the police of their whereabouts and Roy and Hayley are subsequently arrested for Wayne's abduction. Wayne is then returned to Sheila and Alex, where he is threatened by Alex not to tell the police about their consent to him living with Roy and Hayley. Alex is later arrested when Sheila makes a statement to the police, placing the Roy and Hayley in the clear. On Christmas Eve 2001, Wayne reappears when he and Sheila visit Roy and Hayley at the caf√©. Wayne returns in March 2019, 18 years since his last visit to Weatherfield. He visits Roy and tells him that he is investigating the Underworld factory roof collapse as a health and safety inspector, which killed Rana Habeeb (Bhavna Limbachia). Wayne is upset when Roy informs him that Hayley died from pancreatic cancer five years prior to his return, and thanks Roy for everything that he and Hayley did for him, regarding the situation with Alex. Wayne is convinced that Roy's close friend and lodger, Carla Connor (Alison King) is responsible for the roof collapse, and interviews all people who had a role to play in the roof's eventual collapse, including Carla, Gary Windass (Mikey North), Sally Metcalfe (Sally Dynevor) and Nick Tilsley (Ben Price). He concludes that Sally, despite being on the roof while protesting when it collapsed, is by no means responsible, as the roof should have been able to take her weight. He also rules Gary out of his inquiries, after Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) bribes him into not mentioning that he knew the roof was unsafe in order to protect Carla.

He is best known today for his portraits by Frans Hals, though he is remembered locally for his Hofje van Willem Heythuijsen bordering Haarlemmerhout park, which has been in operation for centuries. Biography He was born in Weert, but moved to Haarlem via Cologne, where he first lived with Willem van Heuvel.Speech by Pieter Biesboer in 2011 for the Limburgs Geschied- en Oudheidkundig Genootschap He became a cloth merchant and lived in a large double house on the Oude Gracht (now called Gedempte Oude Gracht) near the Verwulft. Like many other merchants of Haarlem, he owned a summer house along the Spaarne river, facing the Haarlemmerhout park. His neighbor there on the grounds of Spaar en Hout, was Zacharias Hooftman, an Amsterdam merchant who lived in the winter on the Herengracht.Spaarnhout/Sparenhout/Spaar-en-hout on Hans Krol's website Van Heythuysen never married, but lived with his sister Geertruyd. Willem van Heythuysen posing with a sword in 1625, Alte Pinakothek, Munich Haarlem hofje created after his death Van Heythuysen drew up his will and testament in Haarlem with notary Willem van Trier on 13 September 1636. He named his sister Geertruyd as benefactress, but she died only a few weeks after he did in 1650. His will was then executed by his cousin Marten van Sittard and his associate Tieleman Roosterman. Most of what we know about him today comes from this document, which is also his charter for founding the hofjes named after him, namely the Hofje van Willem Heythuijsen in Haarlem, and the Hofje van Willem Heythuijsen in Weert. Though Weert is near the town of Heythuysen, Willem van Heythuysen's family had probably been living in Weert for at least a generation, because a year before he signed his will specifying hofjes to be built in Haarlem and Weert, he had already purchased a property for 925 guilders in Weert to found a poorhouse there which would give precedence to members of his family.Willem van Heythuysen on Weert historical website According to his will, the hofjes were to be built and maintained after his death with funds from the proceeds of his estate. He appointed his brother Frans van Heythuysen and Tieleman Roosterman to build the hofje in Weert. Tieleman Roosterman was one of the two executors of the will, the other one was Marten van Sittard. Roosterman was also the one who built the hofje in Haarlem and he also became its first regent. Portraits by Frans Hals Maerten van Sittard commissioned a copy of the famous Frans Hals portrait of Willem van Heythuysen leaning back in his chair, a portrait that hung in the Haarlem hofje for centuries.Sotheby's lot 26, 9 July 2008, London In August 1653 he made a payment \\"to Frans Hals for the portrait of Van Heythuysen, 36 Guilders\\". It was sold by the hofje regents in 1869 by public auction in Paris and was acquired the following year by the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. Long considered an original portrait painted from life, it was recently, determined that this picture was actually painted after Van Heythuysen died as a copy for the hofje by the artist himself of his earlier 1630s original. The \\"1630s version\\" first appeared at auction in 2008 and was sold for 9 million euros. All in all, Hals painted him three times, including the copy. The other full-length portrait is the one hanging in the Liechtenstein gallery where he poses with a sword. That impressive painting may have been intended as a pendant wedding portrait. He was betrothed to Alida Roosterman (c. 1620-1647), the younger sister of Tieleman, but she died before they could be married. Legacy Heethuysen grave epitaph (Died July 6th, 1650) in Sint-Bavokerk. Nothing remains today of the original homes of Willem van Heythuysen. His summer home \\"Middelhout\\" was sold to Hendrik van Vladeracken, brother-in-law to Roosterman. Hendrik's daughter Susanna became a regent of the hofje and lived to be 90. Thanks to her legacy, the hofje underwent repairs and has remained solvent up to today. A painting was made to honor her that is now in the possession of the Frans Hals Museum. Today on the location of the old Middelhout, an old age home called Spaar en Hout is located. In recent years a modern apartment complex called Middelhout has been built on a corner of the old grounds of Sparenhout. The two hofjes both fared better than his homes. The Haarlem one still exists today, but the Weert one was deconstructed in 1876 to make way for a Catholic school. Willem van Heythuysen was buried in the St. Bavochurch in Haarlem, where his gravestone can still be seen on the south side of the choir.

Since the mid-1970s nanoindentation has become the primary method for measuring and testing very small volumes of mechanical properties. Nanoindentation, also called depth sensing indentation or instrumented indentation, gained popularity with the development of machines that could record small load and displacement with high accuracy and precision.Nanoindentation Lecture 1 Basic Principle, by Do Kyung Kim, Dept. of Material Science and Engineering KAIST, Korea.Fischer-Cripps, A.C. Nanoindentation. (Springer: New York), 2004. The load displacement data can be used to determine modulus of elasticity, hardness, yield strength, fracture toughness, scratch hardness and wear properties.W.C. Oliver and G.M. Pharr.

Types  A round end cone indenter A filament rod indenter Berkovich indenter, which is a 3-sided pyramid where a = 65.03¬∞ There are many types of nanoindenters in current use differing mainly on their tip geometry. Among the numerous available geometries are three and four sided pyramids, wedges, cones, cylinders, filaments, and spheres. Several geometries have become a well established common standard due to their extended use and well known properties; such as Berkovich, cube corner, Vickers, and Knoop nanoindenters. To meet the high precision required, nanoindenters must be made following the definitions of ISO 14577-2,ISO 14577-2 = Instrumented indentation test for hardness and materials parameters. Part 2: Verification and calibration of testing machines. Section 4: Direct verification and calibration. and be inspected and measured with equipment and standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The tip end of the indenter can be made sharp, flat, or rounded to a cylindrical or spherical shape. The material for most nanoindenters is diamond and sapphire, although other hard materials can be used such as quartz, silicon, tungsten, steel, tungsten carbide and almost any other hard metal or ceramic material. Diamond is the most commonly used material for nanoindentation due to its properties of hardness, thermal conductivity, and chemical inertness. In some cases electrically conductive diamond may be needed for special applications and is also available. Holders Nanoindenters are mounted on holders which could be the standard design from a manufacturer of nanoindenting equipment, or custom design. The holder material can be steel, titanium, machinable ceramic, other metals or rigid materials. In most cases the indenter is attached to the holder using a rigid metal bonding process. The metal forms a molecular bond with both material be it diamond-steel, diamond-ceramic, etc. Angular measurements Nanoindenter dimensions are very small, some less than , and made with precise angular geometry in order to achieve the highly accurate readings required for nanoindentation. Instruments that measure angles on larger objects such as protractors or comparators are neither practical nor precise enough to measure nanoindenter angles even with help of microscopes. For precise measurements a laser goniometer is used to measure diamond nanoindenter angles. Nanoindenter faces are highly polished and reflective which is the basis for the laser goniometer measurements. The laser goniometer can measure within a thousandth of a degree to specified or requested angles.http://www.microstartech.com/index/NANOINDENTERS.pdf References Hardness tests Nanotechnology ","title":"Nanoindenter"},{"id":"21370288","text":"Danny F√ºtterer (born 28 August 1975) is a German former football player.

South Holston Lake extends northeastward for into southwestern Virginia, with of shoreline and a storage capacity of , of which is reserved for flood control. The reservoir's operating levels vary by about in a typical year. The dam has two intakes, one at the north end and one at the south end. The north intake transfers water from the reservoir via high-pressure conduit to the powerhouse at the northern base of the dam. The south intake feeds water into the dam's spillway, from which it travels through a sluiceway to a stilling basin at the southern base of the dam. Background and construction Various private entities had investigated the South Fork Holston's hydroelectric potential since the early 1900s, although other than Wilbur Dam on the river's Watauga River tributary, no major projects had been initiated. In the 1920s, the Holston River Power Company conducted a massive survey of the South Fork Holston's watershed with plans to build four dams on the river, including one at the present South Holston Dam site. After the Tennessee Valley Authority gained oversight of the Tennessee River watershed in the following decade, it proposed the construction of two dams in the South Fork Holston basin-- one at the South Holston Dam site and the other at Cardens Bluff (modern Watauga Dam). The primary purpose for building these two dams was flood control, especially in light of a disastrous flood in 1940 that had destroyed several structures in Bluff City and Kingsport, both downstream from the proposed dam sites. The dams would also produce electricity to help TVA meet the high demand for power at the outbreak of World War II. South Holston Dam and its sister project, Watauga Dam, were authorized on December 17, 1941, and work began on February 16 of the following year. Welding work on the steel seams of South Holston's power conduit, circa 1940s The construction of South Holston Dam and its reservoir required the purchase of of land, of which had to be cleared. The construction moved 342 families and 559 graves. It required the relocation of of roads, and four new bridges were built. In October 1942, the U.S. War Production Board ordered a halt to the South Holston and Watauga projects, claiming they were not vital to the nation's war effort. TVA spent several weeks securing the dam sites, and the South Holston project was stalled until the end of the war. Work on South Holston began again on August 4, 1947, as Watauga neared completion. Along with the main dam, the South Holston project required the construction of a saddle dam approximately north of the main dam at the reservoir's Painter Spring embayment. The saddle dam is high and long. The project also necessitated the construction of an auxiliary spillway, since the main dam's morning glory spillway had not been adequately tested. This auxiliary spillway-- known as the \\"Bent Branch Spillway\\" after the stream into which it empties-- is located about south of the main dam. South Holston Dam was completed and its gates closed November 20, 1950. The dam's generator went online February 13, 1951. The total cost of the South Holston project was just over $31 million. Weir Dam (1991) In 1991, TVA built a weir dam, an aerating labrynth weir, approximately 1.5 miles below the main dam, straddling the midsection of Osceola Island. The weir helps to deal with the fact that the water coming out of the bottom of the dam is cold, dense, and oxygen depleted. The water also tends to have unpredictable recirculation currents. The weir counteracts these problems with the water out of the bottom of the dam. The weir oxygenates the water, which helps aquatic insects, vegetation, and fish‚Äîparticularly bass and trout. The weir also prevents the water from refluxing back up to the turbine at the dam, and also calms it down for recreational users, such as boaters, fisherpeople, and swimmers.https://www.tva.gov/About-TVA/Our-History/Built-for-the-People/Weir- Science ReferencesExternal links *South Holston Reservoir -- official TVA site *South Holston Reservoir -- Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency Holston River Dams in Tennessee Tennessee Valley Authority dams Bristol, Tennessee Hydroelectric power plants in Tennessee Buildings and structures in Sullivan County, Tennessee Dams completed in 1950 Energy infrastructure completed in 1950 Tourist attractions in Sullivan County, Tennessee Tourist attractions in Bristol, Tennessee 1950 establishments in Tennessee ","title":"South Holston Dam"},{"id":"21370333","text":"Mark Powell (born 1976) is an American novelist. He is the author of six novels, most recently Small Treasons and Firebird. A highly decorated author, he has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Breadloaf Writers' Conference, as well as two Fulbright Fellowships. Educated at The Citadel, The University of South Carolina, and Yale Divinity School, Powell teaches in the English Department at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina. He repeatedly serves as the fiction workshop leader for the Hindman Settlement School's Appalachian Writers Workshop and the Mountain Heritage Literary Festival at Lincoln Memorial University. Powell's early work has established him in the southern Appalachian tradition alongside writers such as Pamela Duncan, Silas House and Ron Rash. His recent fiction is more global in scope, in the vein of Robert Stone and Bob Shacochis. Novels= Prodigals  Fifteen-year-old Ernest Cobb has fled his South Carolina home after the death of his girlfriend. They both feared she was pregnant and while he's innocent of her murder, he's terrified of facing his father's wrath. In the late summer of 1944, making his way northward to Asheville through the Blue Ridge Mountains, Ernest meets fellow travelers‚Äîdrifters, veterans, and outsiders‚Äîwho are willing to help him. An aging hermit and woodsman, once a glassblower, rescues and revives Ernest after a particularly chilly evening. Upon his arrival in Asheville, he finds work as a dishwasher, takes shelter in a dreary boardinghouse, and soon becomes involved with a new girlfriend. When their relationship ends, Ernest decides to accompany his friend, June Bug, to the logging camps. Told in a minimalist style, Prodigals is a novel about Ernest's loss of innocence as well as America's loss of innocence after World War II. Using the American landscape of small towns and logging camps as touchstones, Prodigals focuses on the subculture of transients and the loneliness driving them.

The CPA intended to bring to international attention the neglected linguistic, cultural, and educational rights of Orthodox Cham Albanians who have been subjected to a Greek policy of assimilation. The group has also launched campaigns on behalf of Cham exiles in Albania. It has encouraged the expansion of contacts with compatriots in Greece, the return of exiles to their family areas, and the payment of compensation for property and land that was illegally taken from them during their expulsion. Activities Since 1991, Albanian activists across the political spectrum have become more outspoken on the Chameria issue vis-√†-vis Greece. Historic grievances over Greek repression of Orthodox and Muslim Albanians earlier this century have been aired, and Athens has been criticized for its ongoing assimilationist pressures against Orthodox Albanians who still reside in the Chameria, Epirus region. Although the Greek authorities have denied that any Cham problem exists, Cham representatives have continued to urge the Albanian government to take up the issue with Athens at the highest bilateral levels.Janusz Bugajski, Nations in Turmoil, Westview Press, 5500 Central Ave., Boulder, p. 185-186.

She is best known for her debut novel, Gods Behaving Badly, a comic fantasy concerning ancient Greek gods living in modern-day Hampstead. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 2007, later becoming a bestseller in Canada. Her second novel, The Table of Less Valued Knights is a comic take on the world of King Arthur. It was published in the UK in 2014 and nominated for the 2015 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction. Her third novel, a Shakespearean comedy entitled Oh, I Do Like To Be... was released in 2018. She is the daughter of Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers.  Life and career  Phillips was born in London and educated at Bryanston School and Robinson College at the University of Cambridge, where she read social anthropology. After university, she worked as a researcher in television documentaries and current affairs, interrupting this career for a year to complete an MA in visual anthropology at the University of Manchester. In 2003 she quit television completely to pursue a career as a writer. Phillips's first novel, The Talentless Miss Pigeon, was turned down by publishers. She worked in bookshops while writing her second novel, Gods Behaving Badly. On the advice of a representative from Random House, Phillips submitted the second work to Dan Franklin, the publishing director of Jonathan Cape, who purchased the UK and Commonwealth rights. Phillips left bookselling in 2007 to concentrate on writing. She also has a regular personal blog on tumblr.com, which often includes reviews of literature, theatre, and film, as well as current television and radio. She was a writer-in-residence for the charity First Story at Harris Academy Bermondsey 2009-10, and at Acland Burghley School in London in 2011. With Robert Hudson she wrote three series of Warhorses of Letters, a BBC Radio 4 comedy about the horses of Napoleon and Wellington starring Stephen Fry, Daniel Rigby and Tamsin Greig. The book of the first series was crowd-funded through the Unbound platform and released in 2012. In 2016 they collaborated on the Christmas series Some Hay In a Manger, also for BBC Radio 4. Writing with various others under the pseudonym Vanessa Parody, she co-authored the 2013 erotic spoof Fifty Shelves of Grey.  Gods Behaving Badly  Phillips conceived the idea for Gods Behaving Badly while listening to a philosophy teacher's comparison between the Christian God and those of the ancient world: > He was saying that the gods of the ancient world had flaws, they were more > human, and I suddenly thought, what if they were right? There is something > arbitrary about belief; if you are a Christian, then you have to believe > that the Hindus are wrong, and the other way round. You can back your > beliefs up with archaeology or sacred texts, but ultimately it comes down to > siding with one team or another. And I thought ‚Äì what about the Greeks? No > one sides with that team any more, but what if they were the ones who got it > right? So here's this group of gods, imagine if they were still around... She drew further inspiration for the novel's plot from the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice. Gods Behaving Badly is Phillips's first published novel. It was released in the UK to largely positive reviews, and has been sold to over 12 countries. including Canada, where it reached #1 in the top-selling fiction list. It was originally optioned for television by Ben Stiller's Red Hour Productions, and was made into a 2013 movie starring Sharon Stone, Alicia Silverstone and Christopher Walken by Big Beach Films.

Dry powder inhaler as well as propellant metered dose inhaler (pMDI) formulations have also been created and evaluated in the laboratory and in early clinical studies. Investigational uses Ciclosporin was brought to market in 1983 but the first non human aerosol studies were not published until the late 1980s. These efforts probed the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of ciclosporin after regional deposition of drug in the lungs. Asthma Ciclosporin has been touted as a therapeutic option in moderate to severe asthmatic patients as a corticosteroid sparing agent. Preclinical studies bear evidence to the fact that ciclosporin when administered orally or via inhalation is capable of blocking T-cell induced inflammation (e.g. via interleukin-2 and 13 formation),Larch√© M, Robinson DS, Kay AB. \\"The role of T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of asthma\\" J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003 Mar;111(3):450-63; quiz 464. eosinophilKhan LN, Kon OM, Macfarlane AJ, Meng Q, Ying S, Barnes NC, Kay AB. \\"Attenuation of the allergen-induced late asthmatic reaction by cyclosporin A is associated with inhibition of bronchial eosinophils, interleukin-5, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and eotaxin. and macrophage recruitment in the lungs. Its use to treat asthma via the oral route may be constrained by systemic side-effects but this limitation may be avoided by targeting the lungs with therapeutic doses via inhalation. Pharmacokinetic evidence suggests that peak and trough levels of drug in the circulation are likely to be below the threshold of systemic toxicity. In addition to biomarkers inhaled ciclosporin has been shown to inhibit airway hyperresponsiveness in rodent models and appears to have been well tolerated in volunteers and mild asthmatic patients receiving the drug in single and multiple doses via pMDI. However, as of early 2009 there are no ongoing clinical trials further exploring ciclosporin's utility in asthma; in part, this may be a consequence of sporadic efficacy and side-effects (from oral use) in a condition that is historically managed by steroids. Acute rejection In light of the observations in relation to its use in asthma, the extension of ciclosporin's use to treat early rejection in the lungs was an obvious one, especially considering the increase in lung transplants performed in the USA and Europe since the mid-1980s. Numbers have increased from 33 in 1988 to 1468 in 2007. Furthermore, acute cellular rejection is common after transplantation and will occur in up to 90% of patients and episodes are most likely to occur in the first post-operative year. Consequently, the application of ciclosporin by oral and IV administration has led to efforts to treat acute and acute refractory rejection by direct aerosol administration first in animal modelsBlot F, Tavakoli R, Sellam S, Epardeau B, Faurisson F, Bernard N, Becquemin MH, Frachon I, Stern M, Pocidalo JJ, et al. \\"Nebulized cyclosporine for prevention of acute pulmonary allograft rejection in the rat: pharmacokinetic and histologic study. J Heart Lung Transplant. 1995 Nov-Dec;14 (6 Pt 1):1162-72. and soon thereafter in transplant patients. Most of these early efforts were carried out by or associated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of aerosolized ciclosporin that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated a marked improvement in survival and reduction of chronic rejection incidence, but not in the primary endpoint of acute rejection. This has warranted more detailed investigations of aerosolized drug to treat or prevent the varied conditions of rejection. Chronic rejection Chronic rejection of the lungs differs significantly from acute rejection. The condition is aptly known as bronchiolitis obliterans and clinically is diagnosed as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Whereas acute rejection exhibits perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells and attendant inflammation of the surrounding tissue chronic rejection appears to have significant epithelial involvement and is essentially a fibro- proliferative disorder of the small airways. Sadly, the median survival after a confirmed diagnosis of BOS is just over 2 years. In fact, despite improvements in outcome associated with acute rejection, virtually no improvement in survival has been noted in chronic rejection over the last 20 years. The surprising finding that aerosolized ciclosporin may prevent or delay development of this insidious condition has led to renewed interest with aerosolized ciclosporin formulations and one early stage trial involving a dry powder inhaler is recruiting while another phase III trial involving nebulized ciclosporin in propylene glycol is underway. Early studies have also been conducted with liposome formulations in volunteers and patients. Other Inhaled ciclosporin has also shown promise in several other lung conditions. Early stage studies in mice have shown some benefit of ciclosporin as an adjuvant therapy in lung cancer when administered as a liposome aerosol in conjunction with paclitaxel.

A prominent member of the Internal Macedonian‚ÄìAdrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), Lerinski was the first person to propose a common anti-Ottoman uprising in Macedonia and Thrace. Gyurov was born in Kotel in Ottoman Rumelia (Northern Thrace), today a town in central eastern Bulgaria. In 1883, he joined the Principality of Bulgaria's armed forces. He took part in the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885. For his bravery, he was awarded a medal and promoted; his comrades even nicknamed him Geroyski (–ì–µ—Ä–æ–π—Å–∫–∏), \\"heroic\\". In 1895, he left the Bulgarian Army to join the Supreme Macedonian‚ÄìAdrianople Committee and take part in its 1895 organized anti- Ottoman action, which involved the burning of Dospat. After the action's failure, he returned to the army as a non-commissioned officer. In 1900, he got in contact with Macedonian Bulgarian revolutionaries Gotse Delchev and Gyorche Petrov, who recruited him in IMARO. They dispatched him as a regional leader (voivode) for the Lerin region (today Florina, Greece), where his nickname comes from. Other IMARO voivodes from the Principality of Bulgaria, such as Hristo Chernopeev, were also recruited at the time. Thanks to Lerinski's military training and his organizational abilities, his armed detachment became what was essentially a school for voivodes and members for the entire IMARO. According to fellow IMARO member and writer Hristo Silyanov, Marko Lerinski turned Lerin into \\"... a region of model in every respect.

After his detachment's location was reported to the Ottoman authorities, Lerinski died in a battle with Ottoman forces near Patele (Agios Panteleimonas, Florina) on 13 June 1902 and was buried in Surovichevo (Amyntaio).

Along with Francis Peabody Magoun, he was the first translator of folktales collected by the Brothers Grimm into the English language. He was also a linguist, teacher, translator of scientific and other materials, a Roman philologist, a comparative mythologist, a classicist and Scandinavianist. Despite his contributions and academic writing, his work has been overlooked in the modern Folklore discipline as he staunchly denied the existence of American Folklore.  Biography  Alexander Haggerty Krappe was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1884. His childhood was said to be unhappy, and after his parents divorced, he was taken back to Europe by his German-born father. Krappe received his education in the Leibniz und Siemen's Oberealschuel in Charlottenberg, Berlin. An accomplished student, he remained at the university until 1915 upon his decision to study modern languages. Thus Krappe spent 1915-1916 studying medieval history and Romance languages at the University of Berlin. Krappe went on to enter the University of Iowa in Iowa City on a graduate fellowship, and received his M.A. with a major in French and a minor in Italian. The capstone of his M.A., his thesis was entitled \\"The Chronology of the old French Chanson de Geste.\\" In January 1918, he began doctoral work at the University of Chicago on another graduate fellowship. In 1919, Krappe received a Ph.D. His work in university established his interest in epic and medieval literature. In 1919, Krappe married Edith Smith, the daughter of Folklorist Grace Partridge Smith. Edith would go on to describe her husband as \\"brilliant, but deeply troubled and enigmatic man when all of the sources are combined, it is the picture that emerges.\\" Krappe died on November 30, 1947 in Iowa City, Iowa, leaving three book-length manuscripts. The most significant of these, and only one published, was a translation of Grimm's Collected Fairy Tales in conjunction with Francis Peabody Magoun.  Krappe's definition of folklore  In his book The Science of Folklore he stated: > Folklore is a historical science, having its own methods of research and > admitting of the same system of checks and verifications as any other. With > its sister sciences it may combine to make up the cycle of our knowledge of > man's past life. From this follows that it may assume the rank of an > ancillary science to any or all of them, and it has done so repeatedly, > notably to the various philogies, history, ethnography, and the history of > religion.Science of Folklore  Krappe's definition of folksong  Krappe's work also extended into the field of folksong, his own scholarly definition > \\"The folksong is a song, i.e a lyric poem with melody, which originated > anonymously, among unlettered folk in times past and which remained in > currency for a considerable time, as a rule for centuries . . . The American > Kentucky Home, though it is supposed to have originated in circle of a > somewhat darker hue than is popular in certain sections of the country, is a > genuine folksong of both colored and white people\\" This also serves as a prime example of Krappe's unpopularity among Folklorists and anthropologists, as Krappe's work many times shows him to be racist and sexist.

The term comes from the Arabic meaning \\"report\\", \\"account\\" or \\"narrative\\". Hadith are second only to the Quran in developing Islamic jurisprudence,Ibn Hajar, Ahmad. al-Nukat ala Kitab ibn al-Salah, vol. 1, p. 90. Maktabah al-Furqan. and regarded as important tools for understanding the Quran and commentaries (tafsir) on it. The hadith literature is based on spoken reports that were in circulation in society after the death of Muhammad. Unlike the Quran itself, which was compiled under the official direction of the early Islamic State in Medina, the hadith reports were not compiled by a central authority. Hadith were evaluated and gathered into large collections during the 8th and 9th centuries, generations after the death of Muhammad, after the end of the era of the \\"rightful\\" Rashidun Caliphate, over 1000 km from where Muhammad lived. In 9 A.H. (630), Muhammad received news of an imminent attack by the Roman Empire, so he left to fight the Battle of Tabuk. He did not want to leave Medina unguarded, since there were concerns regarding the safety of the city, and decided to leave Ali behind as his deputy. Ali asked if he was going to be left behind with the women and children. To this Muhammad replied: :\\"Will you not be pleased that you will be to me like Haroun (Aaron) to Musa (Moses)? But there will be no prophet after me.\\"Sunnah.comSunnah.com The tradition has been reported in various books with minor textual differences.Sunnah.comSunnah.com It is reported that the words \\"and that you are the Caliph of every believer after me\\", were also said. Shia view The Shia also point out that this hadith nominated Ali as the successor of Muhammad. According to Makarem, if we considered with tradition neutrally we could understand that all positions belonged to Aaron on behalf of Moses then exactly the same judgment is established for Ali in comparison with Muhammad. However it is concluded that Ali thought of as the choice of Muslim after the death of the prophet as Aaron had such a position. Besides, Ali also was the minister, consultant, and near companion of Muhammad and a partner in his leadership. Finally, it has to mention that Ali was the successor of the prophet and no other person could take the place.https://www.al-islam.org/fifty-lessons-on-principles-of-belief- for-youth-makarim-shirazi/lesson-37-tradition-manzalah-and  Sunni view  Sunni understanding of the hadith is that the comparison to Aaron was made, because Aaron was only a temporary leader until Moses returned. The exact same situation occurred when Ali was only a temporary leader until Muhammad returned to Madinah from Tabuk expedition. This view is shared by Sunni scholars such as Al-QurtubiHadith of Position ahlelbayt.com and Ibn Taymiyyah.

Their main mode of operation is to passively listen to the Layer 3 routing protocol exchanges between routers for the purposes of network discovery, mapping, real-time monitoring and routing diagnostics. __TOC__ General information Routes analytics technology was motivated by the \\"best effort\\" nature of IP networks and the lack of visibility into the dynamic nature of packet routing across IP networks ‚Äì often referred to as the IP cloud. Typical IP networks are based on a number of interconnected routers. Information is exchanged between network routers using different routing protocols to dynamically determine the best route for packets to take ‚Äì the most widely deployed protocols include OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP and BGP. Route analytics systems function by establishing a relationship (adjacency) with a single router in a Layer 3 network followed by passive listening of the control plane messages being exchanged by the routers. By becoming part of the control plane, route analytics systems effectively act as a passive router, having the same routing knowledge of other network routers but without the ability to forward actual data packets. Though the systems are actively participating in the control plane, they cannot affect how data is routed around the network. The systems must also support the various routing protocols to effectively analyze the updates announced by the network routers. The main features of a route analytics system are: *Real-time and accurate discovery of routed networks *Computation of Layer 3 network routing topology and visualization of primary and redundant paths *Visibility into current and historical routing information (e.g. LSAs, AS Externals) *Detection of routing events, failures or protocol anomalies (for example route flapping) impacting paths or reachability *Ability to handle multiple protocols' routing such as OSPF, IS-IS, or BGP Vendors The Route analytics technology is being offered by less than a handful of vendors today who are addressing a growing market niche consisting of larger enterprises and carriers. These vendors include Packet Design, OPNET, Alcatel-Lucent, Netcordia, Solana Networks, Iptivia and Forward Networks.

The full scripture is published in seven volumes (plus an index in three volumes) and contains around 20,000 \\"divine directions\\" delivered between January 4, 1887 and June 9, 1907.Tenrikyo Overseas Department (2010).

Tenri, Japan: Tenriky≈ç D≈çy≈´sha. Etymology and meaning O is an honorific prefix, while sashizu may refer to ‚Äúinstruction(s)‚Äù or ‚Äúdirection(s).‚Äù In Tenrikyo parlance, the term Osashizu technically has two senses, a broader and a narrower one. In its broader sense, the Osashizu includes all of the oral revelations given by Miki Nakayama (who followers refer to as Oyasama or the \\"Foundress\\"), and Izo Iburi (who followers refer to as the Honseki, or the \\"Main Seat\\"). In its narrower sense, the Osashizu simply denotes the transcriptions of those revelations.A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, 71 History=Transcription In the first few years after 1887, the main scribe of the Osashizu was probably Shobei Masuno. The directions from 1887 to 1888, the earliest records of the Osashizu, are difficult to understand, possibly because the scribe was simply unable to write down all of the words that were said. Eventually a system developed (it is unknown exactly when) where Iburi's directions would be transcribed by three ministers who were on duty at Iburi's residence. While a direction was being delivered, each of them would write a transcription of the direction on rough rice paper with a writing brush. After the direction was completed, the ministers would read over what they had transcribed and locate any mistakes, misheard words, or missing phrases and prepare a clean copy. Masajin Iburi (Izo Iburi's son) was the main scribe of the Osashizu in the fourth decade of the Meiji era (1897‚Äì1906) and by his time, the transcriptions were consistent in intelligibility.Imamura Eitaro (‰ªäÊùëËã±Â§™ÈÉé).„Äé„Åä„Å¢„Å∞‰ªäÊòî„Å∞„Å™„Åó„ÄèOjiba konjaku banashi [Tales of the Jiba, past and present]. pp. 81‚Äì3. When an inquirer wanted to request a divine revelation from Izo Iburi, the procedure was to approach an intermediary, who would relay the inquiry to the Shinbashira (the leader of Tenrikyo, who at the time was Shinnosuke Nakayama), who in turn would relay it to Iburi. The directions in response to the inquiry would be written down while they were being delivered, and the transcriptions would be given to the inquirers.A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, 73. An edition of the Osashizu. Publication An Anthology of Osashizu Translations (2007) The Osashizu was released in series of thirty-two volumes, with the first volume published on 26 October 1927. A seminar on the Osashizu, also known as Tenrikyo's \\"2nd Doctrinal Seminar,\\" was held in the summer of 1929. This seminar consisted of lectures on volumes one through fourteen, which had already been published at that time, covering the divine directions recorded from 1887 to 1895. In October 1930, the thirty-second volume was published, and in June 1931 an Osashizu supplement was published.Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997).

Immediately after the end of the Second World War, the second Shinbashira Nakayama Shozen announced a restoration of Tenrikyo's scriptures and doctrines, including the reprinting and reissuing of the Osashizu. Because the printing mold from the 1930s could no longer be used, the decision was made to make a number of revisions to the scripture and republish it.Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997).

When a pulse is applied to the ground, it expands and contracts the porous rock, essentially freeing the trapped oil.A Shudder in the Oilpatch This technology is used for fluid flow optimization having applications in both the environmental and energy sectors. In the environmental sector the process is marketed as Primawave, while in the energy sector it is marketed as Powerwave. Powerwave technology has been put to use in more than 175 well applications throughout North America, including applications in California, Oklahoma and Alberta.Wavefront Press Room Quick Facts Powerwave has already been used in the field by EnCana, Penn West Energy Trust, Pengrowth Energy Trust, BP, Chevron and Apache Corporation, among others. Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and has offices in Calgary, Alberta and Cambridge, Ontario. The company also has offices in Houston, and Raleigh, North Carolina.  History  Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc., was founded in 1997 under the name PE-TECH Inc. (Pulse Enhancement Technology Inc.). PE-TECH, a privately held company holding intellectual property operated three subsidiaries; Prism Production Technologies Inc., Wavefront Environmental Technologies Inc., and E2 Solutions Inc. (US subsidiary standing for \\"Energy and Environmental\\"). In 2000 the shareholders of the privately held PE-TECH Inc., entered into an agreement with a publicly listed company (or in this case a shell of a company) on the TSX Venture Exchange. A reverse takeover of that entity transformed PE-TECH Inc., from a privately held company to a publicly traded company under the name Wavefront Energy and Environmental Services Inc. For consistency in name branding Prism Production Technologies was renamed Wavefront Reservoir Technologies Inc., Wavefront Environmental Technologies was rolled into Wavefront Reservoir Technologies Inc. and E2 Solutions Inc. was renamed Wavefront Energy and Environmental Services USA Inc. Effective March 27, 2009 the company's name was changed to \\"Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc.\\"  Rationale  Diagram of trapped oil in soil and rock Brett Davidson and University of Alberta professor Tim Spanos teamed up in 1997 to fulfill a need that they believed to exist in the onshore oil drilling industry. While working on oil well stimulation site in Alberta, Canada, Davidson heard from a friend in the industry that there was a need for fast, effective, and inexpensive stimulation treatment for oil wells.Nickles New Technology Magazine - July 1999. \\"Good Vibrations\\" After using the most sophisticated oil recovery techniques, oil companies only retrieve a fraction of the crude oil at their sites. The oil well will become too uneconomical to continue pumping because most of the remaining oil is stuck in the nooks and crannies between the rock and sand.Enhance Oil Recovery Even after all work is done, around 60% of oil is left in the ground. With more than 200,000 fields in North America alone, extracting even as little as 10% more oil would translate to billions of more barrels of oil recovered.  Primary Oil Recovery Stage  During primary recovery, the natural pressure of the reservoir or gravity drive oil into the wellbore, combined with artificial lift techniques (such as pumps) which bring the oil to the surface. But only about 10 percent of a reservoir's original oil in place is typically produced during primary recovery. But petroleum isn't the only thing trapped in the earth. Water hides there too. Sooner or later, the reservoir begins producing water, along with oil, and it becomes uneconomical to continue. The oil companies will then re-inject the water back into the reservoir. This stage of production is called secondary recovery.  Secondary Oil Recovery Stage  Water injection helps maintain downhole pressure so that oil can continue to flow. Water from the injection well is also used to sweep or push the oil towards the producing wells. But rock in the reservoir has varying permeabilities; the more permeable the rock is, the more easily the fluid can flow through. Water takes the path of least resistance when pumped into the ground Unfortunately, water flows more readily than oil, and it always takes the path of least resistance. Once water creates a channel through the permeable rock to the producing wellbore, there is little benefit in injecting additional water. It only bypasses the oil instead of sweeping it ahead. The result is poor recovery from the reservoir.Oil Well stimulation improved  Products and Technologies  Wavefront Technology Solutions's patented technology was created to combat the \\"path of least resistance\\". In this way, the Powerwave and the Primawave share the same scientific principles. This technology, originally penned as \\"Power Pulse Technology\\", uses pulses to improve the liquid flow in the ground for improved oil recovery (IOR) in the energy sector and groundwater remediation in the environmental sector. These identical processes generate a fluid pulse that momentarily expands the pore structure of rock and soil. Liquid is then able to flow freely and more uniformly.Injection Oil Recovery Early iterations of Wavefront Technology Solutions's Power Pulse Technology were penned the \\"Premier Pulse Tool\\". The Premier Pulse Tool, or PPT for short, was a steel mandrel with a valve system on top and inverted swab cups on the bottom. Diagram of how Powerwave and Primawave's fluid pulses generate a more uniform flow of liquid. Using a standard well servicing rig, the PPT would be lowered to a location above the well perforations. The tool would then be raised up eight meters and dropped. This was done between 200-550 times over eight to 12 hours. This workover and field stimulation technique used steady, non-seismic pulse vibrations to knock out perforation blockage and create a tsunami-like wave effect that encouraged flow in the reservoir. This technology, utilized in both the Powerwave and Primawave, generates a fluid pressure pulse that causes a momentary elastic flexure of the pore structure. This pressure pulse moves fluid in and out of a larger number of pore networks, obtaining a more uniform injection front.  Powerwave  In the energy sector, Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. has patented the Power Pulse Technology as \\"Powerwave.\\" This process has been field-tested and proven to increase the amount of oil recovered from on shore oil wells, including low-producing or even abandoned fields.Wavefront ready to flow revenue Powerwave utilizes this technology to improve the flow of water through geological materials, including sedimentary soils and fractured rock. These materials are composed of a solid matrix and pore structure, which contain fluids such as gas and oil. The Powerwave tool generates a fluid displacement wave in the porous media akin to ripples from a stone thrown in a pond. These ripples generate high liquid accelerations in the pores facing liquids out, or treatment fluids in.H04531 DeepWave SDS In the ten plus years that the technology behind Powerwave has been developed by Wavefront Technologies and Environmental Services, it has evolved from a product that cost nearly $1 to make and had to be transported using two tractor trailers to one that can be shipped via courier. The Powerwave tool now is only one meter high and eight centimeters in diameter. Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. leases the product to oil companies and charges around $3,000 a month for a minimum 12-month period. Powerwave's ability to improve uniformity in oil wells has translated to higher production rates, extending the life of a field, and enhancing its value. In Texas, one recent field trial raised production rates from eight wells by 26%. A similar project in Alberta, Canada initially raised output by 18%.  Primawave  In the environmental sector, Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. has patented the Power Pulse Technology as \\"Primawave.\\" Primawave is used largely in the United States. It is licensed to service providers to use the process in conjunction with established methods to treat and eliminate hazardous chemicals from contaminated groundwater.Primawave Article NASA once used Primawave to clean up soil that had been contaminated with tetrachloroethylene (dry-cleaning fluid). In the 1960s NASA had used the hazardous chemical to remove the soot generated by rockets from the launch site. Years after using the chemical, the area was saturated with carcinogens. NASA knew that a mixture including iron fillings would decontaminate the soil. NASA then used the Primawave to get the fillings into the ground.

The city of Dargaz is situated from Tehran and from the center of Khorasan province. It is bound by Turkmenistan from the north, Mashhad from the east and southeast, Chanaran from the south, and Qoochan from the west. Daregaz, which was previously known as Abivard, an area which can doubtless be placed among the most ancient centers of Iranian culture. Excavations in this mountainous site have revealed artifacts dating back as far as the Parthian and Sasanian periods, and pre- historic times. Numerous mounds and other ancient sites have also yielded much evidence of the site's rich historical and cultural inheritance. Throughout its history, the site has been known by a variety of names: Dara, Daragyard, Pavart in pre-Islamic Persia, and Bavard, Abivard after the Islamic expansion. With its rich bazaar and access to fertile lands, the city was considerably more prosperous than neighboring Nesa and was widely known as one of the largest and most affluent cities of the Great Khorasan area. For the period before the advent of the Safavids (r. 1501-1722), the historic city of Abivard was one of the educational centers of Islamic and Arabic scholarship in eastern Iran. Under the Saljuqids, Muhammad born Ahmad al-Abivardi (died 1114), was one of the renowned poets and litterateurs who, later in his life, settled for a while in Baghdad, but on the account of his Shi'ite proclivities was persecuted by the Abbasids. He then attended the court of the Saljuq Sultan Muhammad and was appointed to the position of Chief Accountant of the court. Another contemporary famous name from Abivard is Ali born Muhammad Anvari-Abivardi (died c. 1191), one of the great classical poets of Iran. After the Mongol invasion of Iran and Iraq, Husam al-Din Abivardi (died after 1324) is mentioned as one of the theologians attending the court of the Abbasid caliphs of Egypt. Most of the city population are descendants of Azerbaijanis fleeing the Soviet annexation of what is now the Republic of Azerbaijan. Persians are a significant minority in the city.

Near the site of the present-day town of Loyew in Belarus, a numerically superior force of Ukrainian Cossacks under the command of Cossack warleaders Stepan Pobodailo and Mykhailo Krychevsky was defeated by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth forces under the command of hetman Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç was able to engage the Cossack forces before they merged. First, he defeated the army of Krychevsky, who was mortally wounded; then he defeated Pobodailo's army. Before the battle A Cossack army under Stepan Pobodailo () with a force of about 7,000 took Loyew in summer of 1649 and began using it as an operational base in the region, from which they staged a series of pillaging raids. ≈Åoj√≥w, Rzecz-pospolita Hetman Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç took the Lithuanian army (about 6,000 strong, including about 800 Polish hussars, 1,000 infantry, the rest, lighter cavalry) in the field to challenge him. Bohdan Khmelnytsky, leader of the Ukrainian Cossacks, learned about Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's plans while besieging Zbarazh. He sent part of his forces, an army of about 10,000, under another Cossack leader, Mykhailo Krychevsky (Stanis≈Çaw Krzeczowski), to support Podobaj≈Ça against the Commonwealth. On 23 July the Commonwealth army approached Loyew on the right bank of the Dnieper River. Pobodailo's fortified camp was on the left, and Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç decided to start a siege by shelling the Cossack's camp with his artillery over the river. Battle When Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç learned of the approaching Cossack reinforcements under Krychevsky, he sent 2,000 of his cavalry to scout the enemy, but Krychevsky avoided them and attacked the main Commonwealth army. The Cossack assault was however broken by Commonwealth artillery and infantry fire. Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç then assaulted the Cossacks with his cavalry, but it was encircled by the Cossacks and would have been destroyed if the rest of the Commonwealth cavalry, returning from the failed scouting mission, hadn't arrived at that moment and turned the tables. The remains of Krychevsky's army took up positions in a wagon fort. Initial attempts by the Commonwealth army to take the new Cossack positions failed. In the meantime, Pobodailo's troops crossed the river to help their allies, but were defeated by the Commonwealth. After that, the Commonwealth's final assault on the wagon fort succeeded, with the hussars dismounting and taking to battle on foot.Richard Brzezinski, Velimir Vuksic, Polish Winged Hussar 1576-1775, Osprey Publishing, 2006, , Google Print, p.33 Krychevsky, mortally wounded, was taken prisoner. Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç collected about 40 Cossack banner from the field. Samuel Orgelbrand gave Cossack losses at 3,000 men, 2 artillery pieces and 12 banners. Aftermath Commonwealth forces retook control of the region, but lack of supplies prevented Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç from advancing on Kiev. Radziwi≈Çl was rewarded by the king with possessions at Nevel, Sebezh and Krasne. Not content with those rewards, he would later betray the Commonwealth. Another battle would take place in the same area two years later.

In the first instance he threatened to sue an outspoken constituent who, at a public meeting in November 2008, said she would not be voting for Gray. This was followed in December by a legal threat against a Labor member, from whom he demanded $10,000 and an apology, for criticising him in an internal party report. His behaviour was denounced by Premier Anna Bligh and Gray publicly apologised for his actions. The 2009 state election pitted Gray against Alex Douglas for the third consecutive time.

Their products included hundreds of items for use in the kitchen (e.g. bowls, cutting-tools) and the dining room (e.g. tea services, cocktail shakers and mixers) as well as items such as candlesticks. They were a world leader in manufacturing shooting accessories through nineteenth century and exported powder flasks in large quantities to America, They were known as whistle makers, which like most of their products were of outstanding quality; they were one of the 4 great whistle makers, the others being W Dowler & Sons, J Stevens & Son & T Yates. It was located first at Silver Street (1806), Cornish Place (1822) Sheffield . Their registered trade mark since 1879 was a Trumpet with a Banner hanging from it. Although registered in 1879, the \\"Trumpet with Banner\\" logo was used at times before registration and appears on some of their silver plate pieces. They were one of the foremost names in EPNS and sterling silver tableware including silver tea services and hollowware pieces. They also made silverware serving pieces and had a wide catalogue of patterns. Their tea sets and hollowware pieces produced in silver are very valuable as antiques. They were also famous for their sporting trophies. Two of the most well-known are the Hales Trophy commissioned in 1932 (sometimes called the Blue Riband) though this really refers to the pendant flown by the sailing ship currently holding the record for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic. The trophy was then held by the owners of that ship. The other great trophy is the one presented to the winner of the American Masters Golf tournament held annually in Augusta Georgia. This trophy is a scale model of the clubhouse made in 1959-60 and contains 453 troy ounces of silver. The firm continued to be a family run enterprise until 1976.

Dixon models were intended mostly for outdoor sporting goods, such as hunting related dog calls, shooting gadgets combination whistles, extractors of various kinds and round whistles (in multiple sizes of over 50 different models), Beaufort whistles & double chamber type . D Dixon did not make Escargot-type whistles. It was not known that Dixon & Sons made general service whistles (GSWs) until 2006 when one was discovered. At 1938 The family donated a collection of whistles made by Dixon to the City of Sheffield, the collection is displayed at the City Hall and pictured at a brochure about Sheffield's arm accessories makers.(See Picture in External link). Body stamps Most of the Dixon whistles found are not stamped, as it was not customary to stamp whistles in the earlier Victorian era, except for the ones made of sterling silver .

It is the oldest known remaining 4-6-2 Pacific to exist. It is also the \\"Official State Locomotive of Kentucky\\", designated as such on March 6, 2000. History The L&N; #152 was built in 1905 at Paterson, New Jersey by the Rogers Locomotive Works, with 6256 as its Rogers Construction Number. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad purchased #152 and four identical Pacifics at the cost of $13,406 apiece. Pleased with their five Pacifics, the L&N; purchased forty more, which the Rogers Locomotive Works (by now owned by the American Locomotive Company) sold to the L&N; between 1906 and 1910. Originally, the L&N; #152 serviced stations in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. It pulled Theodore Roosevelt's campaign train between Louisville and Cincinnati in 1912. When more powerful locomotives were purchased by the L&N; in the 1920s, the Pacifics were assigned to the Gulf Coast, a geographically flatter area. Railroad logs prove that #152 was one of the many \\"Pan American\\" passenger service. The #152 also pulled the car holding Al Capone on his way to Alcatraz. As time went on, the #152 was used for less and less important routes. On February 17, 1953, the #152, the last surviving \\"K\\" class Pacific, was retired by the L&N;, with its fate uncertain. During this time it was stored at Mobile, Alabama. L&N; President John E. Tilford personally ordered the locomotive to not be destroyed and turned to scrap. Eventually the #152 was sent to the Kentucky Railway Museum, then located at 1837 East River Road in Louisville, Kentucky; it was one of the museum's first pieces. For thirty years it remained inoperative. After thirteen years of work, in September 1985 it was again in working condition, thanks to funding by the National Park Service and the Brown Foundation. On April 26, 1986 it was again in service, pulling seven railcars with a total of 365 passengers. While being refurbished, it stayed at the River Road location when the rest of the museum moved to its new location at Ormsby Station. As of Saturday 10 September 2011, #152 is withdrawn from service for the rest of the 2011 season due to boiler issues. Railway staff have expressed skepticism that it will be able to return for future use without major work for which funding is not currently available. The next overhaul of the engine was start on July 1st, 2015, as of 2020 it is still underway and currently taking donations on the website for the Kentucky Railway Museum. When it was originally placed on the National Register, it was located at the Kentucky Railway Museum's original location in Louisville, Kentucky. When the museum relocated to New Haven, L&N; #152 came with it. The L&N; Steam Locomotive No. 152 is one of four rail vehicles at the Kentucky Railway Museum on the National Register.

Hinchliffe's resignation came despite a commission of inquiry not attributing any blame to him, finding that the difficulties were a result of structural and cultural problems within Queensland Rail. Following the 2017 State Election, Hinchliffe re-entered Cabinet as the Minister for Local Government, Minister for Racing and Minister for Multicultural Affairs. He was charged with responding to a number of integrity issues with the local government sector in Queensland, culminating in him dismissing the entire Ipswich and Logan City Councils.

In August 2010, Aadi is pushed by Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) and bangs his head as they play a game, while Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) and her girlfriend Sian Powers (Sacha Parkinson) are babysitting. He is later rushed to hospital after he loses consciousness. When the doctors find another bruise on Aadi (as a result of Dev pulling him off the road when a car nearly ran him over), social services are contacted. They suspect Aadi's injuries are not accidental and take Aadi and Asha into care but they are allowed to go home after Simon admits that he hurt Aadi. In September 2011, it becomes clear to Dev that Aadi is a talented golfer. He persuades Sunita to allow him to nurture Aadi's talent although Sunita is unsure as Dev's golf is already becoming very expensive. Sunita finally agrees on the condition that, if Dev is happy to spend money on Aadi and his golf, he needs to be willing to splurge an equal amount on Asha. In April 2013, Aadi is later devastated when Sunita dies in a fire. Asha Alahan Asha Alahan played by triplets Hannah, Harris & Ria Ahmed in 2006 and Tanisha Gorey since 2009, is one of the twins born to Sunita (Shobna Gulati) and Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) in January 2006. She leaves with Sunita and her twin brother Aadi Alahan (Zennon Ditchett) soon after she is born. Asha returns to the Street in December 2009 with Sunita and Aadi. Upon Asha's return, Sunita thinks that she may have measles, after having spots and a temperature. Dr Patel (Josephine Lloyd-Welcome), from the medical centre visits her home and, much to the relief of a worried Dev and Sunita, she is not suffering from measles, just a virus. In September 2010, Asha is taken into temporary care, along with Aadi, when social services believe that Dev and Sunita may be abusing Aadi. She is soon returned to Dev and Sunita when it becomes clear that Dev and Sunita are innocent. In July 2012, Dev and Sunita separate after Sunita has an affair with Karl Munro (John Michie) and chooses to be with him. Aadi and Asha meet Karl and he promises both Aadi and Asha that he won't get in the way of seeing Dev. Aadi and Asha later see Dev attacking Karl when Dev confronts him and Sunita.

Dev discovers that she used his credit card to buy illegal skin lightening cream, and insists on taking her to a doctor. She has also been self-harming, finding out by her father asking to see her arm. Shortly after, Asha begins dating fellow schoolmate Corey Brent (Maximus Evans) and during a video call, he asks Asha to remove her top. She does so, but is unaware that he has recorded her. After an argument involving new schoolmate Kelly Neelan (Millie Gibson) at Asha's friend Amy Barlow's (Elle Mulvaney) house party, Kelly sees Corey viewing the video on his phone. When Corey leaves his phone unattended, Kelly uses this opportunity to get revenge on Asha and sends the video to everyone through a group chat.

Even though the variegated fritillary has some very different characteristics from the Speyeria fritillaries, it is still closely related to them. Some of the differences are: variegated fritillaries have two or three broods per year vs. one per year in Speyeria; they are nomadic vs. sedentary; and they use a wide range of host plants vs. just violets. And because of their use of passionflowers as a host plant, variegated fritillaries also have taxonomic links to the heliconians. Their flight is low and swift, but even when resting or nectaring, this species is extremely difficult to approach, and, because of this, its genus name was taken from the Greek word euptoietos meaning \\"easily scared\\".Rich Cech and Guy Tudor (2005).

The film is about a group of balloonists who are stranded on an island where they are captured by Dr. Frankenstein's female descendant, Sheila Frankenstein, who has been kidnapping shipwrecked sailors for years and turning them into zombies. When she learns that one of the captives is a doctor, she tries to persuade him to aid her in her mad experiments. Plot When a hot air balloon crashes on a remote and uncharted island, the four balloonists and their dog Melvin are captured by a pair of drunken old pirates who take them to the hilltop laboratory home of Dr. Frankenstein's modern-day descendant Sheila Frankenstein (Katherine Victor) who is carrying on the family tradition by turning shipwrecked sailors into pre-programmed bloodless, black-garbed zombies who must wear sunglasses to protect their weird white eyes from light. Discovering that one of the new arrivals is a doctor (Robert Clarke), the buxom, white-haired Sheila quickly brainwashes him into helping her try to save her bedridden 200-year-old husband Dr. Van Helsing using the blood of a Poe-quoting prisoner (Cameron Mitchell) and the nubile bodies of a local tribe of primitive bikini-clad Amazon jungle girls descended from highly advanced aliens who once used the rocky, desolate island as their secret Earth landing site. Meanwhile, the mystic spirit of her ancestor (John Carradine) hovers ever near, channeling from the Great Beyond all of the arcane energies that charge her experiments as he rants about \\"The Power! The Power!!\\", while his immortal creation, the original Frankenstein Monster, lies trapped underwater at the bottom of a pool hidden in a cave, biding its time as it waits for its chance to escape.  Cast  *John Carradine as Dr. Frankenstein *Cameron Mitchell as Clay Jayson *Katherine Victor as Sheila Frankenstein-Von Helsing *Robert Clarke as Dr. Hadley *Andrew Duggan as The Colonel *Steve Brodie as Jocko Production In an interview with Tom Weaver, Jerry Warren stated that between making The Wild World of Batwoman and Frankenstein Island he was living on his ranch as he no longer had interest in the film business. On meeting with Katherine Victor, Warren learned that low-budget horror films were making profits again and decided to make a new film even though he recalled he had not seen any films in the past 15 years. Warren wrote the screenplay and score himself under the alias of Jaques LaCatier and Erich Bromberg respectively. The film was generally the same story of his own film Teenage Zombies, with a connection to the Frankenstein legend added. Warren included a number of actors in the cast who had appeared in his earlier films, including Robert Clarke, Katherine Victor and Steve Brodie. Among the cast was Robert Clarke, who said he initially had high hopes for the film as he felt Warren \\"has a lot of enthusiasm and he can get a lot on the screen for the kind of money he spends. But it soon became pretty apparent that this wasn't going to get much beyond what any of his others had achieved, and it wouldn't reach Planet X or Time Barrier or even Sun Demon as far as quality\\"\\". Release An article on actor Jim Webb in The Los Angeles Times stated that Frankenstein Island would be released in the summer of 1981. Warren later felt he did not make Frankenstein Island modern enough to compete with contemporary films. He made a television version of the film which featured newer material that included scenes with explosions and special effects and cut out portions of the film. Clarke recalled that Warren \\"cut and cut it, but it's still very ponderous.\\" Warren initially discussed a sequel to the film in 1985, which he described as \\"more up-to-date, not so campy and old-time.\\" Warren suggested that Robert Christopher would direct some of the film. Warren died in 1988.  Reception  From contemporary reviews, Jack Zink stated that Frankenstein Island was \\"abominable\\" stating that both John Carradine and Andrew Duggan \\"show their age dramatically enough to indicate the film stock isn't as must as the images imprinted on it\\" and that Warren was \\"a hack\\" and \\"among the '50s-era cheapie filmmakers, hasn't changed his tactics a bit.\\" Zink concluded that \\"cultists may get a kick out of investigation to determine whether Frankenstein Island is terrible enough to rank among the worst films of all time. For the rest, this boring nonsense is an excruciating peek at just how low once-respectable marquee names can sink.\\" From retrospective reviews, academic Peter Dendle wrote in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, called it \\"a ludicrous mishmash of random elements, lovingly stirred into a burgoo of cinematic insanity\\".

(Black Death Greatest Hits Vol. 1) (2005) was recorded in a warehouse in Santa Cruz, California and was recorded mostly live, as with the rest of the band's output. \\"We try to record as much as possible live with minimal overdubs,\\" says Topham. \\"But for the sake of time and frustration, we do some overdubs.\\" Andreoli added \\"especially with looping. In a recording situation where you‚Äôre working with loops one little fuck up a loop 8 minutes in on a ten minute piece it‚Äôs just devastating,\\" concluding that the band tries to only record material that they can play live. After the release of SUPERBASS!!!!, the duo began playing regularly in venues in Santa Cruz, San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland. They began writing their second studio album and in 2007, More Skin With Milk-Mouth was recorded in Topham's apartment in Santa Cruz. The following year, they successfully booked and played their first west coast tour, and a few months later, toured much of the east coast. In 2009, the duo returned to New England and recorded Pink Magick in 2011. In 2013 they recorded a split EP 10\\" with Goddard. In February 2015 the band released a 7\\" titled Spazz Master.

Geographic range Atractaspis microlepidota is found in Senegal, Gambia, southern Mauritania, and western Mali. Notice that this species was formerly considered more widespread; forms and subspecies now considered distinct have been included in Atractaspis microlepidota. Description Atractaspis microlepidota is black in color, with the ventral (belly) side having a lighter, ‚Äúflatter‚Äù tone than that of the dorsal (back) side. The body scales are smooth. The head is flattened and contains a blunt snout. The neck of Atractaspis is not well defined, and the tail is relatively short. One of the differences between Atractaspis and Viperidae is the fact that the head of Atractaspis is covered in plates, rather than small scales like those of Viperidae. The average size is about 18 inches (45 cm), with some growing up to 30 inches (75 cm). Atractaspis microlepidota has from 29 to 37 rows of dorsal scales, more rows than any other species of Atractaspis. Ventrals 212‚Äì245; anal entire; subcaudals 26‚Äì37, entire. Six upper labials, third and fourth entering the eye and largest.Boulenger, G.A. 1896. Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History), Volume III. London. pp. 511‚Äì512, 517. Phylogeny Some common names of Atractaspis are \\"mole viper\\" and \\"burrowing asp\\". The genus Atractaspis is commonly mistaken for the family Viperidae. One reason for this confusion is that the long, hollow fangs of Atractaspis are similar in many respects to those of Viperidae. However, hypotheses about the exact phylogenic placement of Atractaspis suggest that rather than being closely related to Viperidae, Atractaspis is more closely related to the families Colubridae and Elapidae. Evidence that supports this is seen in the venom of Atractaspis, which is unlike viperid venom. The antigenic properties of the venom appear to be related to the venom of Elapidae. The specific properties of the venom will be explained in lower sections. Even within the genus Atractaspis, there are clear differences in the development of the venom gland: Atractaspis microlepidota develops long venom glands, whereas Atractaspis bibronii develops short venom glands. Behavior Snakes of the genus Atractaspis generally do not have many behavioral characteristics that separate them greatly from other snakes, but they have a few. One trait is that they like to burrow, which isn't that odd, however they like to sit still with their nose facing towards the ground, as if it were ready to ‚Äúleap‚Äù into the ground. However, this behavior has only been observed a few times. Atractaspis microlepidota, along with other species of Atractaspis, have not been extensively researched, so data pertaining to the diet of Atractaspis is scant. However, Atractaspis have typically been found with small rodents, birds, lizards, frogs, locusts and white ants in their stomachs or mouths. Some of the feeding behaviors, as well as reproductive behaviors, will be explained in later sections. Venom/Envenomation The majority of research pertaining to Atractaspis microlepidota is about their venom, because they have been observed and studied only a few times in their natural habitat. The venom is viscid and slightly \\"milky\\" in appearance. The way they use their long, hollow fangs is very interesting, and the length of the fangs allows them to inject their venom more deeply into their prey. These fangs share some similarities with those of Viperidae, but also are unique. They do not have to open their mouths to use their fangs; instead they typically use only one fang, which is still not completely understood. There have been assumptions as to why this developed. One hypothesis is that most of their prey also burrows; so the majority of their \\"strikes\\" are underground with limited room for movement. So the theory is that they developed this in order to still successfully bite their prey without having to open their mouth all the way. To \\"strike\\", they come up along the side of their prey and use only one fang to stab the prey. The term \\"strike\\", in quotation marks, is used, because Atractaspis do not attack from a distance, as boids, vipers and some colubrids do. The fangs are also used for manipulating the prey, in order to maneuver and position it for more efficient prey transport. Another interesting observation was that when Atractaspis were presented with more than one prey (in the experiment's case they were mice), the snakes envenomated all the mice before going back to consume them. One hypothesis about this is that it is a defensive strategy against multiple adult rodents, or other adult prey. The actual venom of Atractaspis microlepidota is also interesting. When the venom was injected into animals, the subjects showed immediate signs of moderate irritation, with some hyperactivity and scratching. In human cases, Atractaspis microlepidota venom is not incredibly lethal; however there have been fatal cases among younger children. The venom may initially cause pain near the bite area, which is followed by numbness and swelling, also near the bite area. As also stated above, the venom of Atractaspis microlepidota appears to be related to the venom of the elapids, rather than the venom of Viperidae, as was originally believed. Reproduction Reproduction is very similar to other snakes; Atractaspis lay eggs which hatch outside of the body, which means they are oviparous. The main sense that snakes utilize in order to find mates is smell, which is their strongest, most acute sense. The females produce an odor that sometimes signals to males that she is ready to mate; however, it has also been found that some snakes use these odors for defensive measures rather than attracting mates. It also appears that the males depend much less on sight than any other sense, and almost exclusively rely on odor. This is why, strangely enough, it appears that male snakes do not rely on color, and therefore color probably plays a very little role, if any, in the mating process. Males have even been found attempting to mate with dead females, which shows that they rely heavily on odor for mating. Polygamy is also rare in snakes, as the males usually practice monogamy. It has been suggested that some female snakes even mate with more than one male, with mixed paternity, sperm competition and storage. However, this seems unlikely because, given the former situation, females would not have to select the males for mating. However, in a 1992 report, Schuett and Duvall suggest that female choice does exist among snakes. The various mating rituals, or \\"dances\\" are sometimes very different between snakes, and very little is known so far about the specifics of Atractaspis microlepidota, or Atractaspis mating rituals in general.
