Since 23 March 2017 he has been a member of the House of Representatives. He previously served in the House from 1993 to 1994, and from 2012 to 2015. In the latter three years he also served as leader of GroenLinks. He had also been an Envoy of the Netherlands for human migration since 20 October 2015. Political career Political Party of Radicals Van Ojik comes from the Political Party of Radicals, one of the four parties that merged to form GroenLinks in 1989. Van Ojik had been member of the PPR since 1973. Between 1972 and 1980 Van Ojik studied economics at the Free University. He specialized in development economics. Between 1978 and 1981, he served on the board for radical education. As a conscientious objector, Van Ojik did his alternative service at the development organization NIO. After that he worked for the scientific bureau of the PPR until 1983. Here he wrote a book on basic income. In 1986 he co-authored the PPR's election program. Between 1985 and 1988, he was editor- in-chief of the PPR party paper. Between 1988 and 1990 he was party chair of the PPR. As chair of the PPR, he was involved in the negotiations over the formation of GroenLinks, a new political party formed by the merger of the Pacifist Socialist Party, Communist Party of Netherlands, and Evangelical People's Party. Van Ojik had always favoured cooperation between the four parties, but the PPR party board soon wanted to abandon negotiations. Van Ojik had to defend this, although he did not support it. The formal PPR delegation was replaced by an informal delegation by former party chair Wim de Boer. In 1989 the talks led to the formation of a new party. Van Ojik became a member of the first party board. In addition to these activities, Van Ojik freelance journalist and advisor on the subject of development cooperation. Between 1990 and 1993 Van Ojik worked for Oxfam NOVIB. GroenLinks Between 1993 and 1994, Van Ojik was member of the House of Representatives for GroenLinks. He replaced PPR member Ria Beckers. He spoke on agriculture, development cooperation and science. He prepared an initiative to limit the use of wood from the tropics. It was finally proposed in 1994 by Marijke Vos. At the 1994 election Van Ojik was put on the seventh place of the GroenLinks list, the same place he had in 1989. GroenLinks only won five seats. He also co-authored the GroenLinks election program. In 1997 Van Ojik again co-authored GroenLinks election program for the 1998 election. For GroenLinks, Van Ojik chaired a committee which evaluated the municipal elections (2006), parliamentary (2006) and provincial (2007), all of which GroenLinks had lost. Then he became chair of the committee which oversaw a debate within GroenLinks on the party's principles, strategy and organizations. This led to a new manifesto of principles in 2008 of which Van Ojik is one of the co-authors. After national elections on 12 September 2012 the size of the representation of the GroenLinks party within the House of Representatives was reduced from 10 seats to 4 seats. On 8 October 2012 Van Ojik became leader in the House of Representatives for GroenLinks; some days earlier his predecessor Jolande Sap was forced to step down as leader in the House of Representatives for GroenLinks by the board of the GroenLinks party. Further career After not being re-elected for the Dutch House of Representatives, Van Ojik worked for the environmental organization MilieuDefensie between 1994 and 1997. In 1995 he co-authored a book on corals together with Labour Party politician Max van den Berg. In 1997 Van Ojik switched to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he became director of public communication on development cooperation. In 1998 he again co-authored a book with Van der Berg, now on development cooperation. In 2001 Van Ojik became ambassador in general service. He organized external contacts for the Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation. In 2003 Van Ojik became the Dutch ambassador to Benin. In 2006 he returned to the Netherlands to become director of the inspection for evaluation of development cooperation policy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He also helped the government prepare policy to meet the millennium goals for the fourth Balkenende cabinet. On 12 May 2015 his resignation as Leader of GroenLinks and as member of parliament was announced. Jesse Klaver took over his role as leader of the party, while Rik Grashoff took up Van Ojik's seat in parliament on 20 May 2015.Letter Van Ojik to members of the party published on the website of the party, retrieved 12 May 2015Van Ojik weg als Franctieleider Groenlinks, Klaver volgt op NOS, 12 May 2015 After the 2017 general election Van Ojik returned to the House, taking office on 23 March 2017.

The organization is headquartered in Oakland, California, with additional offices in San Diego and Washington, D.C. The organization believes in a society free of economic oppression, racism and discrimination. Its stated mission is \\"to increase access to health care, improve public schools, make neighborhoods safer, build affordable housing, redevelop communities and revitalize democracy.\\" Faith in Action supports full citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The organization also supports universal health care. History Faith in Action was founded in 1972 by John Baumann, as the Pacific Institute for Community Organization (PICO), headquartered in Oakland, California. In the late 1960s, Baumann had worked with community organizing projects in Chicago, where he became familiar with Saul Alinsky's ideas. During the 1970s, Faith in Action worked with five neighborhood-based organizations, recruiting individuals and families. As neighborhoods experienced the economic and social upheavals of that decade, the neighborhood-based model of organizing became less viable as communities fractured. Following a staff retreat in 1984, Faith in Action shifted to a congregation-based model based in part on the experience of COPS, a federation in San Antonio, Texas developed by Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation. As it expanded beyond the West Coast, in 2004 PICO characterized its acronym as standing for People Improving Communities through Organizing. In 2005, it renamed itself PICO National Network, emphasizing the autonomy of its affiliated organizations, and its role developing national strategy, training, and consultation. The shift to faith- based organizing has emphasized the importance of religious culture to Faith in Action. Its base in northern California meant that Faith in Action could draw on the traditions of a variety of denominations. Sociology professor Richard Wood, who serves on Faith in Action's board of directors, writes that this includes \\"the social Christianity of the historic black churches, the Social Gospel and Christian realist perspectives in moderate and liberal Protestantism, the strongly evangelical but socially responsible orientation of the Church of God in Christ, and the intellectual resources, working-class commitments, and Hispanic cultural ties of Roman Catholicism.\\" In May of 2018, PICO National Network officially changed its name to Faith in Action.https://www.faithinaction.org Activities PICO's California Project led a $190 million public bond initiative for public school infrastructure. PICO's New Voices Campaign, launched in 2004, seeks to help low-income communities have an impact at the national level on such issues as immigration reform, health care, education, and rebuilding the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In October 2008, PICO announced plans for a mid-November meeting in Washington, D.C., in which its affiliates would lobby Congress, the United States Treasury Department, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to help people keep their homes when facing foreclosure. Funding The Ford Foundation is a major donor to Faith in Action. In 2015, Faith in Action was added to the list of the Democracy Alliance's recommended funding targets. Faith in Action has received funding from the Open Society Foundations.

Early life  Jungers was born in Palacios, Texas and spent part of his childhood in that area. He excelled academically from an early age and graduated as one of several valedictorians of his 1966 Streator Township High School class. Standing 6'4\\" tall, he was also an accomplished basketball player throughout his high school career. Following graduation, he attended Oberlin College for his undergraduate education where he was involved in the liberal political and social culture of the late 1960s. He later received his PhD in anthropology from the University of Michigan in 1976 at the age of 26 under the advisorship of Frank Livingstome, Milford Wolpoff and C. Loring Brace. He was hired shortly thereafter at the University of Illinois but moved in 1978 to the State University of New York at Stony Brook Department of Anatomical Sciences, where he has remained throughout the course of his career.  Scholarly life  Jungers is an expert in biomechanics, and has edited an important reference work on primate allometry in particular.Jungers, W.L., ed.

Davis, 113 U.S. 542 (1885), was a suit in equity for redeeming unoccupied and unenclosed city lots from a mortgage, continued from a case brought to the high court during the October 1877 term, (Peugh v. Davis, 96 U. S. 332) the question then was whether certain instruments of writing, made by Peugh to Davis constituted an absolute conveyance of lots in the District of Columbia or were in the nature of a mortgage security for loan of money. The court was of opinion that, on all the facts of the case, the latter was the true construction of the transaction between the parties. Respondent defended against complainant's claim to redeem by setting up that the alleged mortgage was an absolute conveyance. This being decided adversely, held that, in accounting as mortgagee in constructive possession, he was not liable for a temporary speculative rise in the value of the tract, which subsequently declined‚Äîboth during the time of such possession.Peugh v. Davis, 113 U.S. 542 (1885) Justia.com In the prior case, the court below was directed to permit the plaintiff Peugh to redeem the property by the payment of the loan, with interest at six percent per annum, and, as it appeared that the defendant had taken possession of the property, it was said in the opinion that he \\"should be charged with a reasonable sum for the use and occupation of the premises from the time he took possession in 1865, and allowed for the taxes paid and other necessary expenses incurred by him.\\" Upon the return of the case to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, it was referred to an auditor to ascertain the sum necessary to redeem on that basis. Two reports were made, neither of which were entirely acceptable to the parties or to the court, which finally, by a decree in general term, allowed nothing for use and occupation by defendant, but did make an allowance for a sum received from the United States for its use, after deducting from this latter sum the amount paid to an agent for its collection. *The appellant assigns for error that no allowance was made him for the use and occupation by defendant. *The reply to this was that he never used and occupied it received any rents except the amount for which he is charged as received from the government. *The lots were open, unenclosed, with no buildings on them, and no actual possession or use of them was had by the defendant. His possession was merely constructive under his interpretation of the contract, that the land was his own. The witnesses say it was worth nothing in its actual condition, and no evidence is given to the contrary. *It was urged that a sum equal to the interest on the money borrowed by Peugh should be allowed as rent, or for occupation, from the time Davis asserted his ownership and possession. We can see no reason for this, and it would have been in conflict with the instruction contained in the opinion of this Court that he \\"should be charged a reasonable sum for the use and occupation.\\" If this was worth nothing, that was the end of that matter. *It was stated that during the period in question, the land rapidly rose in value and afterwards declined; that Peugh could have sold it, and probably was offered a sum for it which would have left him a large profit, and that he ought in this transaction to set off this loss against the amount he must pay to redeem. This is not allowance for use and occupation. It is damages for a tort. It cannot be recovered in this suit, if it could be recovered in any. The short answer to all this is that Mr. Peugh owed the money he had borrowed from Davis. What he is now claiming in the original suit is the right to pay the money and have a reconveyance of the land. Nothing hindered during all this time that he should pay this money, and if, as he alleges, Davis denied his right to do so, then he should have made a regular and lawful tender of the amount due. If he had done so, the interest would have ceased to run against him, and the amount that he is now required to pay would have been diminished by more than one-half An attempt was made to show that he did make this tender. Some evidence is offered that he told Davis that he was ready to account with him and pay what was due, and that he had the money with him. But in order to make a tender that would have caused the interest to cease, he should have ascertained for himself the sum due, or have fixed upon a sum which was sufficient and then made a formal tender by counting out or offering that sum to Davis distinctly and directly as a tender. The fact that he did not do this is the answer to all that he now claims in this Court. He has been permitted to redeem. His own assertion of that right has been allowed him; but if he ever had this money and was ready and willing to pay it, he did not do so. He did not produce or show it. He did not fix the amount he was ready to pay, but he took the money away with him, and used it himself, and there is no hardship in requiring him to pay six percent interest on it if he wishes to redeem the lots. The decree of the Supreme Court of the district was affirmed.

Early in the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on June 15, 1933, Congress passed an act to authorize the coinage of silver half dollars \\"in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary in 1936 of the independence of Texas, and of the noble and heroic sacrifices of her pioneers, whose revered memory has been an inspiration to her sons and daughters during the past century.\\" This was the first of over two dozen commemorative bills that would become reality during Roosevelt's tenure. The legislation provided that \\"no more than one and a half million pieces\\" be created on behalf of the American Legion Texas Centennial Committee, located in Austin in that state. The coin was designed by Pompeo Coppini, a Texan. The obverse depicts an Eagle sitting on a branch in front of the Lone Star, the symbol of Texas. At the top right of the star it reads IN GOD WE TRUST, and to the left of the star it reads E PLURIBUS UNUM. Over the star it reads UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and at the bottom it reads HALF DOLLAR. The reverse depicts the goddess Victory spreading her wings over the Alamo. It also depicts Sam Houston on her left and Stephen F. Austin on her right. The Six Flags of Texas fly above her head. Under her it reads REMEMBER THE ALAMO. Over Sam Houston, Victory, and Stephen F. Austin it reads THE TEXAS INDEPENDENCE CENTENNIAL. This coin was minted from 1934 to 1938. Mints The Texas Centennial Half Dollar was minted in Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco. The mint mark for the Denver (D) and San Francisco (S) issues appears on the reverse (back) under Victory above the word THE. Philadelphia issues do not have a mint mark. There was a total of about 304,000 coins minted, eventually 154,522 were melted by the U.S. Treasury.

It includes residences, churches and a nature preserve. During much of the 20th Century, this community primarily consisted modest homes. However, in the 1990s it became a neighborhood where ‚Äútear downs‚Äù were increasingly common. This has resulted in the demolition of the modest cottages the community was historically known for. Decatur Heights is accessed off of East Ponce de Leon Avenue to the south, Church Street to the north and Winn Way to the east. The approximate boundaries of the community are Glennwood Estates to the west; Winn Way to the east; the Dekalb Medical Center to the north; Church Street to the northeast; and Ponce de Leon Avenue to the south. The Avondale MARTA station is located immediately south of the community. The community includes several distinct neighborhoods, each constructed in different decades. (Decatur Heights is commonly referred to as the community's name, but it is also the name of the oldest neighborhood within the community.) The neighborhoods located with the City of Decatur include Decatur Heights, Sycamore Ridge and Sycamore Station. The Springdale Heights neighborhood is also part of the Decatur Heights community, but is located in unincorporated DeKalb County. However, the City of Decatur began investigating annexation of Springdale Heights in 2008. The heart of the community and primary north-south road is Sycamore Drive. The geographic heart of the historic neighborhood is generally considered to be Sycamore Drive and Fairview Street. A country store, which was originally constructed as a residence, was located at the southwest corner of this intersection. The store was also torn down and replaced with a single family home. History Streetscape of Sycamore Ridge, a new upscale urban subdivision in historic Decatur Heights The Decatur Heights subdivision is the oldest part of the community. It was developed by Homer C. Lord of the Georgia Land & Investment Company between 1910 and 1928. It primarily includes the streets on the east and west side of Sycamore Drive in the south and west- central (Ridgeland Ave.) part of the community. In addition to Sycamore Drive, the original streets included Ridgeland Avenue, Fairview Street, Pinehurst Street, Hillcrest, Poplar, Oakdale, Grove Street, Woodland and Covington Roads\\" \\" Glencreek Watershed Website: History. Retrieved: 15 August 2008. Sycamore Court townhomes are located within Decatur Heights. The Springdale Heights subdivision, also located on the east and west sides of Sycamore Street, anchors the north end of the community. It was developed in two stages. The residences close to Sycamore Drive were developed in the late 1940s, and include sidewalks which link to Decatur Heights. The residences in the back portion of the east side of Sycamore Street were developed in 1953, but the sidewalks were omitted and the homes are larger 1950s vintage, ranch- style houses. There is a neighborhood tradition that Bridlewood Drive was part of a horse bridle path used by Agnes Scott College students. In addition to Bridlewood Circle, the streets include Poplar Lane Way, Pineview Drive, Woodhaven Drive and North Pineview Court DeKalb Medical Center - North borders this subdivision on the north and east sides. Church Street Manor, a cluster subdivision, borders Springdale Heights on the west side. The Sycamore Station townhome development was constructed in phases in the 1980s and 1990s. It was built on a small farm located between Springdale Heights and Sycamore Ridge. The farmhouse is now the clubhouse for the development. Sycamore Ridge is a totally new development in Decatur Heights, and this subdivision has the greatest concentration of affluent homes in the community. It was constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000, and consists of large homes on small, urban lots. At the time of the development, certain lots fell outside Decatur and were annexed into the city. The name ‚Äúridge‚Äù, however, is inaccurate. Sycamore Street is the ‚Äúridge‚Äù in the community, and the Sycamore Ridge development falls off to the east. In addition to the main street of Sycamore Ridge, streets include Winburn Court, Fitzgerald Court, Renfroe Court, Pinehurst Sttreet, the northern leg of Lockwood Terrace and the eastern leg of Fairview Street.

Temple (February 13, 1822 - April 27, 1880) served on the first Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 1852. Biography Francisco Pliny Fisk (F.P.F) Temple was born in Reading, Massachusetts was the youngest of a family of ten children. He started for Alta California a Mexican territory, by the way of Cape Horn, arriving at Los Angeles in the summer of 1841. There his brother, Jonathan Temple, who had established himself as a pioneer merchant in 1827, was then the leading merchant of the Pueblo de Los Angeles. As his half- brother Jonathan's junior by 26 years, he was born after Jonathan went to sea and moved to California. When F.P.F. Temple arrived in Los Angeles, he had never met his brother. Between 1841 and 1849 he was a Clerk in Jonathan Temple's Store in Los Angeles. Pliny had been nicknamed \\"Templito,\\" or \\"Little Temple\\" as by the natives because of his short height of five feet, four inches (163 cm). Phiny Fisk Temple had been baptized in the Catholic faith at the San Gabriel Mission shortly prior to accepting the Christian name of Francisco P.F. Temple. In 1845, Temple married Antonia Margarita Workman (July 26, 1830 ‚Äì January 24, 1892) the daughter of William Workman and his Taos Native American wife Maria Nicolasa Urioste de Valencia. They had 12 children. In 1851, Workman gave Temple an undivided half share in Rancho La Merced located 12 miles (19 km) east of Los Angeles where he made his home. He planted a vineyard of 30,000 vines, 30 acres (120,000 m¬≤) of fruit trees, and a garden. Temple became involved with real estate, and with breeding and selling cattle.John Steven McGroarty, 1921,Los Angeles from the Mountains to the Sea, Volume II, The American Historical Society, Chicago and New York In 1850 he was elected to be the Los Angeles city treasurer, and in 1852 he served on the first Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors In 1868 Temple with his father-in-law William Workman and Isaias W. Hellman formed the banking house of Hellman, Temple & Co. Three years later Hellman dropped out of the business, but the partnership between Temple and Workman continued as the Temple & Workman Bank in a downtown Los Angeles area known as the Temple Block. In 1875, when nearly every bank in the state closed its doors for a time, Temple & Workman Bank went bankrupt due to mismanagement. Both men lost everything. Temple never recovered from the financial disaster, and Workman committed suicide a year later. Francis Pliny Fisk (Francisco) Temple On April 27, 1880, Temple died and is buried in the Workman and Temple family El Campo Santo Cemetery. He was 58, and was survived by his wife, Antonia, and seven children: Thomas, William, John, Lucinda, Maggie, Walter P. Temple and Charles.

The goal of the march was to capture the Ethiopian capital in a show of force. An Italian mechanized column under the command of Pietro Badoglio, Marshal of Italy, advanced from the town of Dessie to take Addis Ababa. The march covered a distance of approximately .  Background  On 3 October 1935, elements of the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) under General Emilio De Bono invaded the Ethiopian Empire from staging areas in the Italian colony of Eritrea on what was known as the \\"northern front\\". De Bono was the Commander-in-Chief of all Italian armed forces in East Africa. In addition, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the forces invading from Eritrea, the \\"northern front.\\" Forces based in Italian Somaliland under General Rodolfo Graziani invaded Ethiopia on what was known as the \\"southern front.\\" Ground forces on both fronts were amply supported by the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica). Badoglio replaced De Bono in late 1935 and was immediately faced with the Ethiopian \\"Christmas Offensive\\". On the 26 December, Badoglio asked for and was given permission to use mustard gas and phosgene. The Italians delivered the poison gas by special artillery canisters and with bombers of the Royal Air Force. While the poorly equipped Ethiopians experienced some success against the more modern weaponry of the Italians, they did not understand the \\"terrible rain that burned and killed.\\" From early 1936, events on the field of battle did not go well for the Imperial Ethiopian Army. On the southern front, Graziani eliminated a large Ethiopian army commanded by Duke (Ras) Desta Damtew during the Battle of Genale Doria using poison gas. Badoglio used poison gas to eliminate the Ethiopian northern armies one after another. He destroyed Ras Mulugeta Yeggazu's army in the Battle of Amba Aradam. He destroyed Ras Kassa Haile Darge's army in the Second Battle of Tembien. Finally, he destroyed Ras Imru Haile Sellassie's army in the Battle of Shire. By 31 March, the last Ethiopian army on the northern front was commanded in battle by the Emperor himself, Haile Selassie. His army included six battalions of Ethiopia's best troops, the Imperial Guard (Kebur Zabangna). The Emperor led an ill-fated counterattack during the Battle of Maychew which he could not realistically hope to win. The Emperor's army suffered heavy losses during costly frontal assaults on prepared Italian defensive positions. But the bulk of his army was destroyed during the days immediately following the battle when poison gas was used to decimate the withdrawing columns. On 20 April, Marshal Badoglio flew to the town of Dessie in Wollo Province and made his headquarters there. He decided to advance from Dessie and take the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. Dessie is only two-hundred miles (320 km) from Addis Ababa. Except for a pitiful procession of refugees, the road to the capital was clear. The Italian Commander-in-Chief faced no meaningful Ethiopian resistance.  Mechanized column  Because of the lack of resistance between Dessie and Addis Ababa, Badoglio risked a spectacular advance with a \\"mechanized column\\" for propaganda purposes. In 1936, \\"mechanized\\" meant infantry transported in a variety of commercial cars and trucks. \\"Motorised infantry\\" is a more appropriate term for Badoglio's column. Thanks to the organizational genius of a Quartermaster-General Fidenzio Dall'Ora, Badoglio's \\"mechanized column\\" came together in Dessie between 21 and 25 April. Dall'Ora was able to organize the most powerful \\"mechanized\\" column to appear on an African road up to that time. In addition to 12,500 Italian troops, the column included 1,785 cars and trucks of all makes (Fiats, Lancias, Alfa-Romeos, Fords, Chevrolets, Bedfords, and Studebakers), a squadron of light tanks (L3s), eleven batteries of artillery, and aircraft. Special vehicles carried 193 horses so that when the column arrived at the gates of Addis Ababa, the Marshal and his staff could leave their cars and ride in triumph on horseback.  March  The Horn of Africa and southwest Arabia ‚Äì Mid-1930s. The March of the Iron Will was between Dessie and Addis Ababa. At the same time, General Rodolfo Graziani was advancing from the south towards Harar. Emperor Haile Selassie travelled from Addis Ababa, to Harar to Djibouti in French Somaliland to go into exile. On 24 April, Badoglio sent two columns of 4,000 Eritreans ahead by force march to protect his mechanized force as a precautionary measure. But the adversity the Eritreans and the march itself encountered was mainly caused by rain and mud. Badoglio's precautionary measure proved to be superfluous. Imperial highway Badoglio's mechanized force advanced along the Imperial Highway between Dessie and Addis Ababa. The Italian Commander-in-Chief was to uncharitably refer to this road as \\"a bad cart track\\". Badoglio expected some show of resistance at Termaber Pass, and the mechanized column did halt there for two days but all was quiet. The column stopped because a section of the road had been demolished and had to be repaired. On 4 May the Italian formation was ambushed in Chacha, near Debre Berhan, by Ethiopian forces under Haile Mariam Mammo. In the ensuing battle, Haile Mariam's men killed approximately 170 Italian colonial troops and captured four Italians, two of whom were doctors. They were later released. Addis Ababa In Addis Ababa, Emperor Haile Selassie visited the French Legation. After explaining to French Minister Paul Bodard that further defense of the capital was impossible, he explained that it was best for Empress Menen Asfaw and their two sons, Crown Prince Asfa-Wassan, 19, and Prince Makonnen, 13, to leave the country. Ultimately they would go to the Coptic monastery in the British Mandate of Palestine, but he asked the French Minister whether the Royal Family could temporarily find refuge in French Somaliland and was assured by Bodard that they could.Time magazine, 11 May 1936 Haile Selassie then returned to his Palace and crowds gathered at the Palace steps. To the gathering throng, he said, \\"Ethiopia, will fight until the last soldier and the last inch! Let every man who is not wounded or sick take arms and enough food to last five days and march north to fight the invader!\\" The crowd roared back to their Emperor: \\"We will go!\\" With this, five thousand men, bravest remnant of the old Imperial Guard, shouldered their rifles again and marched away. Forgetting the raw gas burns on his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear to him that the Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One possibility was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life. After his somber meeting with his chieftains, Haile Selassie visited Sir Sidney Barton at the British Legation. He spoke softly to Sir Sidney but to the point. Britain had encouraged him with fine words and had made many promises. However, Britain had provided Ethiopia with few guns for which the Ethiopians had paid cash. Haile Selassie stressed that he had risked his own life for Ethiopia but also for the League of Nations. He asked Sir Sidney whether Britain would now come to his aid in this hour of direst need. Shortly afterwards Haile Selassie drove away, his mouth grim with disappointment. Before he departed, Haile Selassie ordered that the government of Ethiopia be moved to Gore, he ordered that the mayor of Addis Ababa maintain order in the city until the Italian arrival, and he appointed Ras Imru Haile Selassie as his Prince Regent during his absence. Late on 2 May, after the Emperor left the city to go into exile, there was a breakdown in civil order. Only the dregs of Ethiopia's soldiery were left behind in the doomed capital. They went wild, looted shops, screamed curses at foreigners, and fired rifles into the air. The new Palace, pride of Haile Selassie, was thrown open to the mob. Most foreigners found safety within the British compound. In twenty-four hours, the Ethiopian Empire fell apart and native law and order disappeared. Rioting in Addis Ababa grew worse by the hour. An attack was made on the Treasury's \\"gold house.\\" A few loyal employees tried to save the remnant of Emperor's gold with machine guns, but sword-swinging looters rushed them and cut off their hands as they clung to their guns. Arrival of the Italians During the evening of 4 May, elements of the I Eritrean Brigade reached the outskirts of Addis Ababa. They reached the city before Badoglio's mechanized column and they managed to accomplish this feat on foot. Meanwhile, Badoglio's motorized column, pushing on as fast as possible, drew closer and closer. Italian aircraft reconnoitred over the city. By the time the main column reached the capital at 4:00 pm on 5 May, the truck-borne Italians were almost delirious with joy. Few could foresee that the conflict in Ethiopia would go on for another five years and that the day that these soldiers could reap the rewards would never dawn. A heavy rain fell as Badoglio's forces entered the city and restored order. The rioting that started after Haile Selassie left lasted until order was restored with the arrival of the Italians. White flags were displayed everywhere as Badoglio made his triumphal entry into the city of the \\"King of Kings.\\" Many city residents fled south or tried to take refuge in the foreign compounds which they had been attacking. A detachment of Ethiopian customs guards presented arms as Badoglio's car drove past them. Further on, an Italian guard of honor, which accompanied the advance guard for this very purpose, paid Badoglio the same courtesy. There was no question now of stopping to allow Badoglio to use the horses brought for this occasion. The car and truck bound procession continued. When Badoglio's entourage pulled up in front of the Italian legation at 5:45 pm, the Tricolour of the Kingdom of Italy was hoisted. Then followed three cheers for Italy's King Victor Emmanuel and three cheers for Italy's Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. After the cheering, Badoglio turned to a senior member of the Italian Royal Air Force and said: :\\"We've done it! We've won!\\" The fall of Addis Ababa had been expected in Italy, but when the news reached Rome during the evening of 5 May, there were scenes of wild excitement. Mussolini was called back ten times by the jubilant crowds at the Palazzo Venezia. Significantly, the march was completed in only ten days across difficult terrain and in bad weather. It was an achievement that demonstrated the offensive potential of motorized forces in securing bold advances. However, the Italian \\"March of the Iron Will\\" turned out to be little more than a logistics exercise. In the words of an anonymous journalist at the time: :\\"Far more of a sports event than a page in military history.\\"  Aftermath  During the week following Marshal Badoglio's entry into Addis Ababa, Dr. Johann Hans Kirchholtes, the German Minister to Ethiopia, visited what had been the Italian Legation in the Ethiopian capital city. Badoglio was now Viceroy and Governor-General of Italian East Africa and the former Italian Legation was now his headquarters. Kirchholtes provided the first recognition by any foreign government that the conquest of Ethiopia was an accomplished fact.Time magazine, 13 May 1936 Meanwhile, one of Marshal Badoglio's staff officers, Captain Adolfo Alessandri, visited every foreign legation in Addis Ababa. Alessandri politely explained to each envoy that they would enjoy \\"every diplomatic privilege until the time of your departure.\\" This was Italy's official notification to the world that occupied Ethiopia would not be considered to be on the same footing as the Japanese Empire's puppet state of Manchukuo. The former Ethiopian Empire was to be a colony of the Kingdom of Italy. Giuseppe Bottai was named as the first Governor of Addis Ababa and Haile Selassie's former Palace became his residence.

Iver Huitfeldt (5 December 1665 ‚Äì 4 October 1710) was a Norwegian-Danish naval officer who was killed in action, when he commanded the ship Dannebroge during Great Northern War 1700‚Äì1721. Biography Iver Huitfeldt was born in the Norwegian town of Halden. He lost his mother at the age of six and his father died six years later. Both his parents died in his childhood years and he was therefore later raised by his stepmother with whom he moved to the Norwegian area of Hurum. At the age of 16 he sent an application to Christian V of Denmark-Norway in which he applied to join the navy. It was granted and he started the trainee programme of the Dano-Norwegian navy. As a part of the trainee period he first served in the Dutch fleet before later joining the French fleet. He returned to do service in the Dano-Norwegian fleet in 1689 as a 24-year-old lieutenant, but in the following year he returned to do service in the Dutch navy to get more experience. He participated in the Battle of Beachy Head, where the Dutch- English navy was defeated by the French fleet under the command of admiral Tourville. An admiral he served under just two years later at the Battle of La Hogue, where the French navy was defeated by a Dutch-English fleet. In 1691 he got the title as captain in the Dano-Norwegian fleet and in 1704 he was appointed commander. This year the king also ordered Ivar Huitfeldt to take charge of the ship yard in Kristiansand, a position he held until 1707. Medallion of the sea hero Iver Huitfeldt Death Iver Huitfeldt was killed in action during the Great Northern War at a battle in K√∏ge Bugt on 4 October 1710. The Dano-Norwegian fleet was engaged by the Swedish fleet, and Huitfeldt's ship Dannebroge exploded after a fire on deck reached the gunpowder depot. After the ship caught fire, Huitfeldt ordered his crew to remain onboard and continue firing at the Swedish fleet. Due to Dannebroge's strategic position, this decision allowed the rest of the Dano-Norwegian fleet to escape, but lead to the deaths of almost the entire crew. The corpse of Ivar Huitfeldt was later found on the beach in K√∏ge Bugt. According to the commander in chief of the Dano-Norwegian navy, Ulrik Christian Gyldenl√∏ve, the fire on Dannebroge was probably ignited by the cannons of the ship.

Scholarship  Critical multiculturalism  Critical Multiculturalism is a pedagogy focused on the intersection of power, identity and knowledge. Steinberg laid out its framework in her 2001 book, Multi/Intercultural Conversations, though Kincheloe and Steinberg introduced the concept in their 1997 book, Changing Multiculturalism. In a 1998 review, Dr. Stephen Bigger writes, \\"'Different ways of seeing' could be a powerful concept to underpin a challenging and transformative curriculum, encouraging 'learning from difference'.\\" He explains further: > Multiculturalism, a problematic term, is clarified into a position called > ‚Äòcritical multiculturalism‚Äô, described with approval inasfar as it explores > ‚Äòthe way power shapes consciousness‚Äô...Race, gender and class are seen as > linked as forms of oppression rooted in social and economic structures. > These forces of oppression play out in the classroom, through which pupils > construct their own understandings, sense of identity and aspirations...We > can view the classroom as ‚Äòa central site for the legitimization of myths, > lies and silences about non-white, lower socio-economic class and other > marginalized individuals‚Äô.  Media literacy  Steinberg's courses revolve around the critical pedagogical approach to media, as defined in a book co-edited with Donaldo Macedo:Media Literacy: A Reader. Central is the notion that social, cultural, and political forces affect human agency. According to the publisher's website, the authors' conception of media literacy, \\"analyzes the ways our everyday decisions are encoded and inscribed by emotional and bodily commitments relating to the production of desire and mood, all of which leads, in Noam Chomsky‚Äôs famous phrase, to the 'manufacture of consent.'\\"  Kinderculture  Steinberg and Kincheloe introduce their notion of \\"kinderculture\\" in Kinderculture: The Corporate Construction of Childhood (Westview Press 1997), an edited collection of essays focusing on the social construction of childhood in contemporary America. According to Steinberg and Kincheloe, \\"our society's most influential pedagogues are no longer classroom teachers\\" or parents. Instead, large corporations become pedagogues, using mass media and popular culture (such as television, films, and video games) to culturally socialize the postmodern child. In their introduction, \\"No More Secrets - Kinderculture, Information Saturation, and the Postmodern Child,\\" the pair provide a name for this corporate construction of children's culture: kinderculture. Steinberg and Kincheloe point out that corporations use various forms of kinderculture such as Barbie dolls, Disney movies, horror novels, and educational television programs \\"to inject their teachings into the fantasies, desires, and consumptive practices of contemporary children.\\" Corporations recognize that children and parents have different tastes and \\"exploit\\" these differences in order to both make a profit and (re)produce targeted cultural images and ideologies. The edited collection includes Steinberg's chapter, \\"The Bitch who has Everything,\\" where she analyzes how Barbie and Mattel's messaging around Barbie impact young girls' lives. Critics point out two shortcomings of Steinberg and Kincheloe's work: the (mostly) homogenous make- up of the collection's contributors and its bias toward an audience of teachers and parents of middle-class children. While many of the essays address the role race, class and gender play in the construction of kinderculture, they do not focus on how children of color/less-privileged children fit into this scheme of corporation consumption.  Post-Formalism  In 1993, Kincheloe and Steinberg revolutionized notions of cognition with their seminal article, A Tentative Description of Post-Formal Thinking: The Critical Confrontation with Cognitive Theory in the Harvard Education Review, drawing attention to the positivist assumptions made in much of concrete analyses in the work of Jean Piaget. In their 1996 work, Measured Lies: The Bell Curve Examined, Steinberg and Kincheloe write that \\"post-formal thinking about thinking involves our ability to engage in ideological disembedding, the ability to remove ourselves from socio-interpersonal norms and expectations...post-formal thinkers engage in a running meta-dialogue, a constant conversation with self.\\" In 1999, Steinberg and Kincheloe teamed with Patricia H. Hinchey to write The Post-Formal Reader : Cognition and Education, and Steinberg and Kincheloe continued to develop this idea for the next several decades. According to a review of post-formalism by Raymond A. Horn, Jr., he notes that post-formalism is explicated \\"in a four-part structure that includes etymology, pattern, process and contextualization.\\" More generally, postformal inquiry looks at questions of meaning and purpose, multiple perspectives, human dignity, freedom, and social responsibility. Curriculum and instruction based on postformalism involve detecting problems, uncovering hidden assumptions, seeing relationships, deconstructing, connecting logic and emotion, and attending to context.See http://eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch;_SearchValue_0=EJ466427&ERICExtSearch;_SearchType_0=no&accno;=EJ466427 Published works Journal articles: Books, authored: *(2000) Contextualizing Teaching: Introduction to Education and Educational Foundations.

The film's plot spans a decade and evolves around the relations of two middle class, urban couples, Veli and Selda, Veli's business partner Ender and G√ºl. Selda is romantically and sexually involved with Ender, while G√ºl and Veli are also in an extramarital relationship. The film examines Turkey's financial and cultural turmoils of the past 20 years through these four middle-class people who search for their own places and stances in society, and through their romantic, friendly and treacherous relations. The film is set in a single apartment, however, because the plot spans a decade, and the apartment is used as a set for music videos, commercials or TV serials, those images seep into the film's imagery while the decoration of the house continuously changes throughout. The film was shot completely digitally in an 80 square meter (861 square feet) flat at the Kuledibi neighbourhood in Beyoƒülu, Istanbul. The film's title \\"Ara\\" means \\"between\\", \\"space\\", \\"distance\\" in Turkish, and it is a reference to the main characters' \\"in between-ness\\" in society and their own relationships. Plot Ara tells the story of two couples over a period of about 10 years. The men are close friends, and so are their partners, thanks to them. One of the women, G√ºl, is half French half Turkish living in Istanbul. She rents her house to film crews to shoot commercials, movies, TV series and music videos. When the homes of her friends Ender, Veli, and Selda, are flooded, they also stay in her flat. The film follows these four friends living in this house from 1998 until 2008. Production Script Writer-director √úmit √únal was expected to shoot Sultan Mutfakta after he completed Istanbul Tales, but preferred to make Ara instead for budgetary reasons. √únal constructed the script especially for two actors, who both turned the offer down. The script was completed in the summer of 2006. √únal first came up with the idea of making a film on relations at a single setting, in one house, after moving out from his home where he lived with his ex-wife. According to √únal, the script has autobiographical elements, \\"but rather the autobiography of a generation that is in its 40s now.\\" √únal also was inspired by English playwright Harold Pinter's 1978 play Betrayal that deals with an affair that entangles a married couple. The Ender character corresponds to the director √úmit √únal, if he had studied Economics, instead of Fine Arts. Shooting and editing Shooting began on May 10, 2007, and both shooting and editing were completed in only 13 days, due to the being done on a daily basis as the shooting went on (a standard feature film usually takes from one month up to a year for the editing to be completedFilm editing). Reception Ara was generally well received by critics in Turkey, however audience numbers were quite low compared to blockbusters (9,332 in 13 weeks as opposed to 102,900 by The Bank Job in 17 weeks).Sinemat√ºrk The film was released in 18 theaters, most of them art house cinemas. At the 2008 Istanbul International Film Festival, Ara received the Special Prize of the Jury in the National Competition and Serhat Tutumluer won the Best Actor Award. Controversy A controversy arose when Ara was not selected to compete at the 44th Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival. √úmit √únal sent a public letter to the festival director Engin Yiƒüitgil protesting that Ara was eliminated as contender by a pre-jury whose members were not revealed, and without a rationale. √únal added that he will not have any of his future films screened at Antalya as long as the current festival structure is maintained. √únal also turned to the Turkish film organisations Scriptwriters' Association and Film Works Owners' Association. On September 30, 2007, another director, Ali √ñzgent√ºrk, in support of √únal, accused the festival as being undemocratic and that Golden Orange \\"has been using Turkish cinema as an extra for the last few years. Directors Engin Ay√ßa, whose Suna, Selma K√∂ksal, whose Fikret Bey, and Mehmet Eryƒ±lmaz, whose A Fairground Attraction were not nominated, also protested and accused the festival for not showing the necessary attention to Turkish cinema. The Golden Orange Film Festival administration did not reveal the reasons for Ara not being included in its competition, how many films applied to the competition of how many were eliminated.

At the time of her launch, she was the largest cargo ship under American registry. During the United States occupation of Veracruz in April 1914, Washingtonian was chartered by the United States Department of the Navy for service as a non-commissioned refrigerated supply ship for the U.S. fleet stationed off the Mexican coast. In January 1915, after a little more than one year of service, Washingtonian collided with the schooner Elizabeth Palmer off the Delaware coast and sank in ten minutes with the loss of her $1,000,000 cargo of of raw Hawaiian sugar. In the days after Washingtonians sinking, the price of sugar in the United States increased almost nine percent, partly attributed to the loss of Washingtonians cargo. Lying under approximately of water, Washingtonians wreck is one of the most popular recreational dive sites on the eastern seaboard.  Design and construction  In November 1911, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for two new cargo ships‚Äî and Washingtonian.Maryland Steel had built three ships‚Äî, Georgian, and Honolulan‚Äîfor American-Hawaiian in 1909 in what proved to be a satisfactory arrangement for both companies, and in September 1911, American-Hawaiian placed an order for Washingtonians four older sister ships‚Äî, , , and . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an eight percent profit for Maryland Steel, but capped at a maximum cost of $640,000 each. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a five percent down payment in cash and nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal had provisions that allowed some of the nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of Washingtonian, including financing costs, was $71.49 per deadweight ton, which totaled just under $733,000. Washingtonian (Maryland Steel yard no. 131) was the second ship built under the contract. The ship was ,Cochran and Ginger, p. 365. and was in length (between perpendiculars) and abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of , and, at the time of her launch, was the largest American-flagged cargo ship. Washingtonian had a speed of , and was powered by a single steam engine with oil-fired boilers which drove a single screw propeller. Washingtonians cargo holds, providing a storage capacity of , were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so she could carry perishable products from the West Coast to the East Coast, such as Pacific Northwest salmon or fresh produce from Southern California farms.  Service  When Washingtonian began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route arrived at Mexican ports‚ÄîSalina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo‚Äîand traversed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway.Hovey, p. 78. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.Cochran and Ginger, p. 355‚Äì56. Washingtonian sailed in this service, but it is not known whether she sailed on the east or west side of North America. After the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which took place while six American-Hawaiian line ships were being held in various Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access (the Panama Canal was not yet open until later that year) caused American-Hawaiian to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Strait of Magellan in late April.Cochran and Ginger, p. 360. During the U.S. occupation, the Washingtonian was chartered by the U.S. Navy Department to serve as a non-commissioned refrigerator and supply ship for the U.S. naval fleet off Mexico. She was outfitted for her first voyage at the New York Navy Yard and sailed with of fresh meat for the United States Navy and the U.S. Army. Washingtonian sailed in a rotation with the commissioned Navy stores ships and . With the official opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian line ships switched to taking the isthmus canal route. In late August, American-Hawaiian announced that the Washingtonian‚Äîher Navy charter ended by this time‚Äîwould sail on a San Francisco ‚Äì Panama Canal ‚Äì Boston route, sailing opposite vessels , Honolulan, and sister ship Pennsylvanian. Washingtonian sailed from Los Angeles in early October with a load of California products‚Äîincluding canned and dried fruits, beans, and wine‚Äîfor New York City and Boston. After delivering that load, Washingtonian then headed for Honolulu, Hawaii, to take on a load of raw sugar valued at about $1,000,000. Departing Honolulu on 20 December, Washingtonian arrived at Balboa on 17 January 1915 and transited the Panama Canal. Sailing from Crist√≥bal on the eastern end two days later, she headed for the Delaware Breakwater en route to Philadelphia.  Collision  At 3:30 a.m. on 26 January, some from Fenwick Island, Delaware, the American schooner Elizabeth PalmerElizabeth Palmer was a five-masted, wooden schooner built in Bath, Maine, in 1903, and considered one of the largest U.S. sailing ships at the time. See: Shomette, p. 207. was under full sail at on a southwest by south course. Elizabeth Palmers captain saw a large steam vessel, Washingtonian, on an apparent collision course ahead, but did not change course since navigational rules require steam-powered vessels to yield to vessels under sail power. The captain of Washingtonian, two quartermasters, and a seaman were all on watch and saw Elizabeth Palmer, but misjudged the schooner's rapid pace. When Washingtonian, underway at , did not change course or speed, Elizabeth Palmer collided with the starboard side of the steamer, leaving a large hole that sank Washingtonian ten minutes later. Less than a mile (2 km) away, Elizabeth Palmer, with her jib boom and the top of her foremast stripped away by the impact, began taking on water through her split seams. When it became apparent that the big schooner would sink, her captain ordered her abandonment, and she slowly settled and went down about an hour after the collision.Shomette, pp. 209‚Äì10. After Washingtonians crew abandoned ship, one crewman, a water tender, was found to be missing and was presumed drowned. Washingtonians 39 survivors and all 13 crew members from Elizabeth Palmer were picked up about an hour after the collision by the passenger liner Hamilton of the Old Dominion Line, which arrived at New York the next day. The collision had repercussions for American-Hawaiian and the world sugar market. The financial impact of the collision on American-Hawaiian, estimated at $2,000,000, was devastating.Shomette, p. 211.Washingtonians captain and the company were at fault because navigation rules required that steam-powered vessels yield to sail-powered vessels. See: Shomette, p. 209. Contemporary news reports in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal both told of the collision's impact on the sugar market. Claus A. Spreckels, president of Federal Sugar Refining, noted that the loss of even such a large cargo would not normally have much effect on the sugar market. However, weather in Cuba, then the largest supplier of sugar for the United States, had reduced that island nation's crop by more than 200,000 tons. Further affecting the situation was World War I, then ongoing in Europe,The still-neutral United States did not enter World War I until April 1917. which had reduced the tonnage of shipping available to transport commodities like sugar. With all of these factors, the asking price for sugar futures contracts for February 1915 delivery was 2.90 cents per pound (6.39 cents per kg) a week before Washingtonians sinking, but had risen to 3.16 cents per pound (6.96 cents per kg) the day after the sinking. Washingtonians wreck, a skeletal framework of hull plates and bulkheads, lies upside down in about of water,Shomette, p. 206. and is one of the most-visited wreck sites along the eastern seaboard.Shomette, p. 212.Lying about a mile away from that of Washingtonian, the wreck of Elizabeth Palmer‚Äî\\"worm-eaten and disintegrating\\"‚Äîis, in contrast, little visited. See: Shomette, p. 212. A popular night dive, Washingtonians wreck is also a favorite with sport divers catching lobster.

This family trait began in medieval northern Germany and continued with the Bethmann bank, which Johann Philipp Bethmann (1715‚Äì1793) and Simon Moritz Bethmann (1721‚Äì1782) founded in 1748 and soon catapulted into the foremost ranks of German and European banks. Even after the bank's sale in 1976, there are Bethmanns engaged in commercial real estate and forestry in the 21st century. The most notable of the Bethmanns was Simon Moritz von Bethmann (1768‚Äì1826), a banker, diplomat, politician, philanthropist and patron of the arts. His sister Maria Elisabeth was the mother of Marie d'Agoult and the grandmother of Cosima Wagner; his sister Susanne Elisabeth was the great-grandmother of Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg. Beginnings in Goslar The Bethmann family, which produced the famous Bethmann banking dynasty, resided in Frankfurt am Main from the early 18th century onward.Herders Conversations-Lexikon, p. 517, volume 1 Earlier ancestors had come from the northern German town of Goslar.Brockhaus' Konversationslexikon, p. 899.Helbing, p. 27.Johann Philipp Freiherr von Bethmann, in Sarkowicz, p. 58.Kl√∂tzer 1994, p. 62.

Hieronymus served as chairman of the merchants' guild, as Kornherr responsible for grain stocks, town councillor, member of the Sechsmann inner council and finally of the Neuer or governing council. Hieronymus died as the Swedes were entering Goslar. The town never fully recovered from the ransacking and pillaging of the Thirty Years' War, especially the three years of Swedish occupation. Some of the 19th century literature incorrectly claimed that the family had originated in the Netherlands.Dietz, p. 621. The family assigned its archives in 1965 to the city of Frankfurt.Kl√∂tzer 1985, p. 60. The Bethmanns' archival materials occupy some 300 meters of shelf space, and the oldest document therein is a calligraphed agreement dated 29 May 1321, regulating traffic on the street between the Basler Hof property, which the Bethmanns purchased in 1762, and a neighboring house.Institut f√ºr Stadtgeschichte Bankhaus Gebr√ºder Bethmann, (W1/9) Coat of arms Coat of arms of Simon Moritz von Bethmann (1768‚Äì1826) The Bethmann family's coat of arms can be traced to 1530.

He bequeathed a substantial fortune to his widow, Anna Elisabeth (1654‚Äì1727), whom he had married in 1678.Helbing, p. 123. She was a native of the northern German town of Minden, where the church of St Simeon, Protestant since 1529, and the Roman Catholic monastery of St Maurice stand side by side to this day.Article by Dr. Hans Nordsiek , former director of the municipal archives of Minden This may explain why in subsequent generations, there was always one son named \\"Simon Moritz\\".In contrast, Helbing (at p. 123) quotes Bethmann family lore to the effect that the frequency of \\"Simon Moritz\\" in the family was to remember a religious foundation in Minden dedicated to Saints Maurice and Simon. As a Protestant, the widowed Anna Elisabeth and her children quitted the Archbishopric for the Lutheran city of Frankfurt am Main; there she found it easier to comply with her religious obligations and benefited from the presence of relatives. Three of her daughters married citizens of Frankfurt. Her son Simon Moritz Bethmann (1687‚Äì1725) served the House of Nassau-Weilburg as an Amtmann or bailiff-magistrate, in Bergnassau on the river Lahn. This Simon Moritz Bethmann had three sons: # Johann Philipp Bethmann (1715‚Äì1793), # Johann Jakob Bethmann (1717‚Äì1792) and # Simon Moritz Bethmann (1721‚Äì1782). Founding of the bank Upon the death of Simon Moritz Bethmann in 1725, his widow Elisabeth Bethmann, formerly Thielen (1680‚Äì1757), returned to Frankfurt, where she became housekeeper in the household of her brother-in-law, the merchant Jakob Adami (1670‚Äì1745).According to most sources. In contrast, Kl√∂tzer names a Johann Adami as the uncle, but that appears unlikely (see, for example, this webpage on the Adami family maintained by the Peterskirchhof cemetery in Frankfurt where Adamis and Bethmanns lie buried; clearly Jakob Adami was the uncle who made the bequest to his nephews and Johann was a cousin of Jakob.) In his will, he bequeathed to his nephews half of his fortune. Johann Philipp and Simon Moritz took control of the Jacob Adami trading enterprise, out of which in 1748 the banking enterprise of Gebr√ºder Bethmann developed. This eventually became the House of Bethmann.Allgemeine deutsche Biographie, vol. 2, pp. 574-576. Johann Jakob ‚Äì the middle brother ‚Äì established a trading branch in Bordeaux. Later he became the imperial consul in Bordeaux and founded the Bordeaux branch of the family, which continues to this day.Kl√∂tzer 1994, p. 63. Within a short span of time, the Bethmann bank developed into one of Frankfurt's leading Christian-owned banks, on a scale comparable only to its younger rival, the House of Rothschild. The bank's fortunes began to rise in 1754 based on its business in imperial, princely and municipal bonds and skyrocketed from 1778, thanks to the bank's innovation in breaking the amount borrowed by the Austrian emperor200,000 guldens, according to Wanner (2005) in Handelsblatt, 20,000 according to Ferguson (1995) down into \\"sub-bonds\\" (Partialobligationen) at 1000 guldens eachFerguson, p. 40; in contrast to German writers, who cite this as a Bethmann innovation, Ferguson writes that the method was imported from Amsterdam. offered to the public,Wanner 2005 which made them tradeable in secondary markets. This transformed the bank from a lender to an underwriter of bond issues. At one point, the profits of Gebr√ºder Bethmann exceeded those of all its Frankfurt competitors put together, and it ranked first among all German banks. Simon Moritz, a major donor to Frankfurt's Citizens' Hospital, died without issue, but the marriage in 1762 between his elder brother Johann Philipp and Katharina Margarethe Schaaf (1741‚Äì1822), daughter of the Frankfurt notable Anton Schaaf, produced six children, four of whom survived to adulthood: # Susanne Elisabeth (1763‚Äì1833) was married in 1780 to the Frankfurt merchant Johann Jakob Hollweg (1748‚Äì1808), who changed his name to Bethmann-Hollweg upon marriage. Her son Moritz August would become a Prussian minister of state, and his grandson in turn was Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, who served as Imperial German Chancellor from 1909 to 1917.Kl√∂tzer 1994, p. 66. # Simon Moritz (1768‚Äì1826) was among the most notable of Frankfurt's bankers, statesmen and philanthropists. # Maria Elisabeth (1772‚Äì1847) was married in 1790 to the banker Johann Jakob Bu√ümann (1756‚Äì1791). Widowed only a year later, she remarried, this time to √©migr√© French aristocrat Alexandre Victor Francois Vicomte de Flavigny (1770‚Äì1819). Her daughter from the second marriage was Marie d'Agoult (1805‚Äì1876), who in turn gave birth to several children, among them‚Äîfrom her liaison to Franz Liszt ‚Äì- Cosima Wagner (1837‚Äì1930). # Sophie Elisabeth (1774‚Äì1862). First families of Frankfurt In Frankfurt, the beginnings of an independent polity date back to the grant of privileges to its citizens by then king Friedrich II in 1217.Die Macht der Patrizier , Frankfurter Rundschau Online Not long after, an upper crust of burgher families began to constitute itself. To them were reserved seats on the town council, which were passed on by inheritance to the sons of the council members. This clique of generally wealthy families was called Patricians, after the patricii ruling families of ancient Rome. Some of these patrician families, like the Holzhausens, had an unbroken run of sixteen generations on the town council from the 13th to the 18th century. As the daughter of a Kaiserlicher Rat and Sch√∂ffe, Katharina Margarete Schaaf gained her husband Johann Philipp access to Patrician society; she was on familiar terms with the mother of Goethe and, even after she was widowed, maintained a respected salon where she received Madame de Sta√´l in 1808. By 1816, when Frankfurt's new constitution abolished the privilege of heritable office for the Patrizier, the cachet of belonging to one of their societies had already become much less significant.

Ramadier.Alexander I and adorned with the Russian order of Vladimir and St. Anna. Upon the death of Johann Philipp Bethmann in 1793, his son Simon Moritz became head of the House of Bethmann. His peers called him \\"Frankfurt's premier citizen\\", while in France some called him le roi de Francfort. His financial dealings gained him entrance to nearly all the ruling families of Europe, and he exploited these contacts on numerous diplomatic missions on behalf of his hometown. In 1802 he negotiated successfully with France for a reduction of her demand for contributions to the cost of war. In the negotiations on the German mediatisation, he bargained for and achieved the secularization of ecclesiastical assets within the territory of Frankfurt for the benefit of the imperial city. In 1802 he was appointed Russian consul for Frankfurt, followed by his appointment in 1807 as Russian Consul General and Staatsrat or Russian Counselor of State. In 1808 he received the patent of an Austrian nobleman from Francis I, Emperor of Austria. Thenceforth, he and his descendants would be named von Bethmann. However, to the people of Frankfurt his \\"Russian\\" title of Staatsrat stuck, and so even after he returned that commission to Tsar Alexander I he was simply known as the Staatsrat. On 31 October 1813 the retreating Emperor Napoleon spent the night as an unannounced guest at the Bethmanns' garden house. Bethmann's negotiating skills managed to persuade the French to withdraw their army without further bloodshed from Frankfurt. Besides promoting commerce, Simon Moritz von Bethmann was an ardent supporter of the arts and sciences in the city of Frankfurt. In 1812 Bethmann inaugurated a museum of antique and classicist sculpture within a stretch of land that he had turned into a park six years earlier.Private historical website . (Both the building and the park were sold to the city in 1856). His donations made it possible to establish the city library on the northern bank of the river Main between 1820 and 1825.With the inscription LITTERIS RECUPERATA LIBERTATE CIVITAS that Schopenhauer would derisively call \\"kitchen Latin\\". He was a major donor and co-founder of secondary schools (Musterschule in 1803, Philanthropin in 1804, Wei√üfrauenschule in 1806); his efforts on behalf of the Philanthropin were particularly noteworthy, for in supporting this Jewish school and promoting its cause among his Christian brethren, Simon Moritz was ahead of his time. In 1687 when Anna Elisabeth Bethmann named a son Simon Moritz, it may have been that she wanted to show her support for ecumenicism or it may simply have been that she fondly remembered the twin landmarks of her hometown. For her great- grandson‚Äîthe third Simon Moritz‚Äîthere was nothing accidental about what he set out to do: support the Jews in their struggle for civil rights. In this respect, Simon Moritz was not unique. A generation earlier, Enlightenment figures like Gotthold Ephraim Lessing had begun militating for Jewish emancipation. Unusually, however, at the same time that Simon Moritz was helping the Jews of Frankfurt to secure greater freedoms for themselves, he was carrying on a fierce business rivalry with the Rothschilds in which no quarter was ever given.Nor could Simon have contemplated the least letup in this competition: many other rivals of the Rothschilds were not as able to keep up and eventually fell by the wayside. On Christmas Day 1826, he suffered a stroke in a box seat of Frankfurt's municipal theater, an institution which he had co-endowed, and succumbed two days afterward.Kl√∂tzer 1964, p. 64. Bethmann was buried in the cemetery of the Church of Peter in Frankfurt, where his grave is preserved to this day. Simon Moritz von Bethmann had married Louise Friederike n√©e Boode (1792‚Äì1869), daughter of a respected Dutch family, granddaughter of a Huguenot named MartinHelbing, p. 125. and a native of British Guiana, in 1810. The Louisa park off a major carriage route in the southwest part of Frankfurt is named after Louise von Bethmann.Pfeiffer-Belli, p. 80. Four sons issued from this marriage: # Philipp Heinrich Moritz Alexander von Bethmann (1811‚Äì1877)Meyers Gro√ües Konversations-Lexikon 1905, p. 768. # Carl Ludwig Caesar von Bethmann (1812‚Äì1871) # Alexander von Bethmann (1814‚Äì1883) # Jacob Heinrich Friedrich von Bethmann (d. 1845 without issue) Because Bethmann's sons had not yet achieved the age of majority upon their father's death, the bank's partners stepped in as pro tem directors of the bank. In 182,8 his widow remarried to Matthias Franz Joseph Borgnis (1798‚Äì1867). Magnates of industrial revolution Assembly of German princes in Frankfurt on August 18, 1863Fechenbach castle In 1833, Moritz von Bethmann succeeded to the directorship of the bank. He financed the construction of numerous railways in Germany and made especially sure that Frankfurt turned into an early node of rail traffic. Together with the House of Rothschild, Moritz started the Taunus-Eisenbahn AG in 1836, the Frankfurt-Hanau railroad in 1844, and the Rheingau railroad in 1845, to name just a selection. Investments were made during the 1850s in other European railroads ‚Äì such as the Italian Central Railroad, the Austrian state railroad, and the Rhine/Nahe railroad established in 1856. In 1842 he became a Prussian consul, then Prussian Consul General in the Free City of Frankfurt from 1854 to 1866. He was granted the heritable title of Freiherr, a rank of minor nobility, in the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1854. Also in 1854 he co-founded the Frankfurter Bank, in 1862 the Frankfurter Hypothekenbank, and in 1873 the Degussa company.Kl√∂tzer 1994, p. 65. In 1863, he hosted the German princes convening to discuss constitutional reform in his garden mansion. Following in the footsteps of his father, he too was a generous patron of the arts in Frankfurt and contributed heavily to philanthropic causes, arts and letters, and organized equestrian activities. On 18 September 1848, he gave refuge to mortally wounded Prince Felix Lichnowsky who had been attacked by a mob ostensibly outraged over foreign policy decisions. He was married to Marie von Bose.Helbing, p. 124. Moritz' brother Carl Ludwig Caesar von Bethmann purchased the castle of Fechenbach in 1842, earning him the title of a Bavarian Freiherr. His oldest son Karl Moritz \\"Charly\\" von Bethmann proved a spendthrift and got himself in hock to a loan shark charging 6 per cent interest a week. Karl Moritz was hoping for a rescue from the House of Bethmann, but Moritz von Bethmann was unfazed: he said that total ruination was the best cure for his profligate nephew Charly.Private historical website The last male descendant of this line, Karl Alexander Moritz Freiherr von Bethmann, died in 1942. Fechenbach castle was sold to a private buyer named Wissler but confiscated by the Nazis a year later. Following the end of WWII and after a decade as an orphanage, the property was restituted to the Wissler family, who completed its construction in 2006.

Trained in London, he joined Gebr√ºder Bethmann as partner in 1869. He gained broad experience in several industries, serving as non- executive director on the boards of rail and banking companies. This Simon Moritz kept up the railroad business but also got the bank involved in municipal bonds and industrial investments worldwide. A passionate huntsman and athlete, he became a wheelchair user following a riding accident in 1879. He gave generously to local and charitable causes, sponsoring the Golden Book of Frankfurt am Main in 1902. Of their three children, only Simon Moritz survived. After serving as First Lieutenant in World War I, he set out to transform the Bethmann bank into a full-service bank. Simon Moritz Henning August Freiherr von Bethmann (1887‚Äì1966): following studies of the law in Lausanne and Leipzig, he joined Gebr√ºder Bethmann as partner in 1913. In 1914, he married Maximiliane Countess Schimmelpenninck, a granddaughter of Dr. Eugen Lucius, a founder of Hoechst AG, thus adding the landed estate of Gut Sch√∂nstadt near Marburg to the Bethmann holdings. He joined the board of the stock exchange and became its president in 1933. This Simon Moritz contributed his time to numerous cultural institutions of Frankfurt, such as the administration of the St√§del museum, as well as non-profit foundations. He co- founded the first Rotary Club in Frankfurt and accepted an appointment as Swedish Consul General. In 1929, he served as chairman of the supervisory board of Frankfurter Bank. When World War II ended, he was a lieutenant colonel (reserve).

He also played for the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro American League, from whom he was purchased by the Phillies in 1954. A prodigious minor-league slugger, Herrera was listed at tall and ; he threw and batted right-handed. He was the first Afro-Latino to play for the Phillies. Early career Born in Santiago de las Vegas, near Havana, Herrera began his organized baseball career in the higher levels of the Phillies' farm system in 1955. As a 23-year-old prospect, he spent 1957 with the Miami Marlins of the International League, where he, Woody Smith, Mickey Micelotta and Bobby Young were considered to be one of the best infields in the circuit; one writer said, \\"They make plays the Phillies couldn't make.\\" That season, Herrera batted .306 with 173 hits, 17 home runs and 93 runs batted in. With the Phillies He began 1958 on Philadelphia's 28-man National League roster, but went hitless in 11 at bats and was sent back to Miami in May when rosters were cut to 25. After batting .282 with 20 homers for the 1958 Marlins, he was recalled to the Phillies in September when squads could carry 40 players. He started 15 late-season games at third base, and got untracked at the plate in a five-game stretch from September 13‚Äì17, going 12 for 19, raising his average from .053 to .342,Retrosheet: 1958 NL batting log and hitting his first major- league home run off left-hander Bill Henry of the Chicago Cubs on the 16th at Connie Mack Stadium.Retrosheet box score (16 September 1958): \\"Chicago Cubs 10, Philadelphia Phillis 8\\" He finished his first MLB season with a respectable batting mark of .270 and 17 hits. But Herrera could not make the 1959 Phillies. A December leg injury sidelined him during Cuba's winter league season, and he gained unneeded weight.Ram√≠rez, Jos√©, Pancho Herrera. Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project Although his leg had healed by the time the 1959 campaign began, Herrera was back in the International League, this time as a member of the Buffalo Bisons, the Phils' new Triple-A affiliate. Herrera proceeded to win the league's Most Valuable Player award and its Triple Crown, pacing all hitters in home runs (37), runs batted in (128), and batting average (.329), as well as in hits (187). He was also elected to the league's All-Star team as a first baseman. That banner year at Triple-A set the stage for , Herrera's most productive campaign as a major leaguer. He appeared in 145 games, starting the season in the unlikely role of the Phillies' regular second baseman before permanently shifting to first base in May. He collected 144 hits, homered 17 times, added 26 doubles and six triples, and batted .281 for the season; he posted an OPS of .803. He also led National League batters with 136 strikeouts, a league record at the time (it would be broken by Dick Allen four years later). Herrera also committed more errors (13) than any other first baseman in the league. Still, Herrera finished a distant second to Frank Howard in that year's Rookie of the Year balloting.Baseball Awards Voting for 1960: NL Rookie of the Year Voting But he couldn't build on that success. Although he started 1961 as the Phillies' regular first baseman, his production seriously declined: his OPS dropped to .759 on 32 extra-base hits (including 13 home runs) and his batting average dipped 23 points to .258. He continued to strike out at an alarming rate, with 120 whiffs, second in the National League. That off-season, Philadelphia traded for veteran American League slugger Roy Sievers to take over as the club's first baseman for 1962, and Herrera played the rest of his career in the minor leagues. Minor league slugger He had another strong season for Buffalo in 1962, making the All-Star team and leading the International League in home runs (32) and tying for the RBI title (108). At season's end, the Phillies used him and outfielder Ted Savage in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates for veteran third baseman Don Hoak. He played another seven years of minor league baseball, including four more seasons in the International League, before retiring in 1969, although he continued to play sporadically until 1974. After that he managed in both the Mexican and Florida State leagues. He continued to hit the long ball, especially late in his career in the Class A Mexican Southeast League, where he was a player-manager in the late 1960s. As a big leaguer, Herrera collected 264 hits, with 46 doubles, eight triples, 31 homers and 128 career RBIs. He struck out 270 times, and batted .271 lifetime.

Morgan Yeatman joined the partnership in 1839 and they changed firm's name to Taylor, Fladgate, & Yeatman. This partnership was brought about by the agency of the London importer Matthew Clark, who was married to a cousin of Fladgate and a long term associate of Taylor, but Fladgate and Yeatman ceased using Clark in 1845, causing a crisis in that firm.unpublished memoir by Mrs. Catherine Clark in possession of Charles Gordon Clark Today, the only direct kinship with Fladgate at Taylor, Fladgate, & Yeatman is David Fonseca Guimaraens, Winemaker and Technical Director, the son of Bruce Duncan Guimaraens and Fladgate's great-great-great nephew.

That Collett was an integral part of her maiden name is confirmed by the parish records for St. Leonard's, Streatham, Surrey, where Margaret was born 24 November 1817, as three of her siblings are also shown as bearing the Collett Dalgleish surname: Maria, b. 1 November 1811; James, b. 11 October 1814; and Alexander, b. 9 December 1815. This is further supported by the 1881 UK Census entry for Henry Wood's household at Woodside Lodge, Leavesden, Watford, Hertfordshire, which records the presence of three of Margaret's sisters who were born in London: Henry's wife Louisa Collett Wood age 54, and two of his sisters-in-law: Rebecca Collett Williams, widow, age 56, and Elizabeth Collett Dalgleish, unmarried, age 70.

They descended from a certain Berardo who was called \\"Francisco\\" because he came from Francia, who came to Italy with Hugh of Provence, King of Italy from 924 until his death in 948. According to the Chronicle of Monte Cassino, the first known member of this family, Azzo, Berardo's uncle, was a Burgundian count.Azzo comes Burgundi√¶, avunculus Berardi The conti di Marsi considered themselves Berardinga, \\"Berardings\\" or, by modern historians, Bosonids. The chronicler of Monte Cassino who records this decisive event was of the house himself, Leo Marsicanus (1046, Marsica ‚Äî 1115 or 1117, Ostia) (meaning \\"of the Marsi\\"), also known as Leone dei Conti di Marsi; Leo became a monk in Monte Cassino around 1061 and served as a cardinal in the early twelfth century. As Azzo and Berardo arrived in Italy with Hugh in 926, it is likely that these Burgundian counts originated in the Kingdom of Arles, originally the southern part of the kingdom of Burgundy, where Hugh's family originated. Though the name Azzo is familiar today from the Este family, later rulers in Ferrara and Modena, the name was not unusual in northern Italy at the time. The Lombard gastaldate of Marsi in the territory of the dukes of Spoleto was erected as a county by Louis the Pious.Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica da S. Pietro sino ai nostri giorni, 1847, s.v. \\"Marsi\\". Three sons of Berardo are recorded in the Chronicle of Monte Cassino, Rinaldo and Oderisio, both counts of Marsi in a charter of 981,Raynaldus et Oderisi germanis comitibus; the charter was occasioned by a property dispute settled by Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor. and Azzo II, whose son Lupo was abbot of Montecassino.: abbati Lupus filius Azzoni de Aprutio, \\"Abbot Lupo, son of Azzo of Abruzzi\\". Abbot Lupo's first cousin Oderisio and his wife Gibberga were joint benefactors of Monte Cassino. Powerful nobles like the conti di Marsi expected to place their sons in commanding positions in the church hierarchy as well. Marsi itself was an ancient episcopal see, and younger sons of the counts served repeatedly as bishops: Alberic, son of Berardo III, succeeded in 970 to the see, in which he was succeeded by his natural son, Guinizio, in 994. In 1056, Azzo dei conti di Marsi was transferred from his see of Chieti to that of Marsi. In 1110 Berardo dei conti di Marsi was named bishop by Paschal II; Berardo was a cardinal, with the tituli first of S. Angelo in Pescheria, then of S. Grisogono, and was canonized long afterwards (1802) as Saint Berardo; his great niece, Saint Rosalia,Pietro Antonio Tornamira, Della Prosapia Paterna, Materna e di Palermo, Patria della Gloriosa Vergine S. Rosalia (1674) presented the genealogical connection; Rosalia was the daughter of conte Sinibaldo delle Rose, a member of the court of Ruggero I and son of Teodino, the Cardinal's brother. is patroness of Palermo. The chronicler Amatus of Montecassino names Oderisius, the oldest brother of Berard, Count of Marsia, against whom Berard rebelled, specifying that he had seven sons, two of whom were bishops, a third a monk and a cardinal at Rome.. This Bernard, who died after 1070/73, \\"through insatiable greed and desire for wealth fell out with his brother\\" the chronicler reports. Dissension among the counts of Marsi enabled the a new power to be reckoned with in the south of Italy, that of Robert Guiscard, whose base of power lay to the south, in Apulia and Calabria, to defeat the individual members of the Berardings and establish Norman power in southern Italy.

Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court involving the doctrines of qualified immunity and absolute immunity. Background Arthur Ernest Fitzgerald was a deputy for management systems in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. He discovered $2 billion in cost overruns and technical problems in the Lockheed C5-A program, which had been concealed by the officials at the Pentagon. He testified before the Joint Economic Committee in Congress, and following this, he was blacklisted from roles of any significance. Following the release of the Watergate tapes, Fitzgerald was mentioned by President Nixon who boasted that he was responsible for firing Fitzgerald. He filed a lawsuit against government officials claiming that he lost his position as a contractor with the United States Air Force because of whistleblower testimony made before Congress in 1969. Absolute immunity was claimed by the officials involved, including Richard Nixon and several of his aides, generating several additional cases which made their way to the Supreme Court. While Nixon, named in the lawsuit, was found to have absolute immunity in his role as president, as decided in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, Harlow v. Fitzgerald examined whether this degree of immunity extended to the President's aides. Opinion In an 8 to 1 decision, the court held that government officials other than the president were generally entitled to qualified immunity. An official can obtain absolute immunity, but must \\"first show that the responsibilities of his office embraced a function so sensitive as to require a total shield from liability. He must then demonstrate that he was discharging the protected function when performing the act for which liability is asserted.\\" Despite its immediate application to White House aides in the case at bar, the case is regarded as most important for its revision of the qualified immunity standard that is applicable to government actors more generally. The Court held that \\"government officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\\"  References   External links  * United States Supreme Court cases 1982 in United States case law Second Enforcement Act of 1871 case law United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court ","title":"Harlow v.

Feared security compromise In 2015, during security testing conducted as a prelude to a possible acquisition by Amazon, it was reported that some Elemental servers contained chips from Chinese manufacturing subcontractors that allowed backdoor access. According to a U.S. government investigation, the chips were inserted by a People‚Äôs Liberation Army unit. These reports were denied by all of the companies involved, no such chips were ever found, and the acquisition proceeded without further incident. Funding Elemental received its initial investments in 2007 in the amount of $1.05 million from three angel funds: the Seattle-based Alliance of Angels, the Oregon Angel Fund, and the Bend Venture Conference. In July 2008, Elemental announced it had closed its first round of venture capital financing, receiving $7.1 million, which included investments from General Catalyst Partners of Boston, Massachusetts and Voyager Capital of Seattle, Washington.

Milan. Built in 1963, the centre consists of , including a pinewood and a little lake. It is located between the towns of Carnago, Cassano Magnago and Cairate, in the province of Varese, about 40 km northwest of Milan. Milanello currently represents an important asset not only for the Milan Club, but for the whole Italian football system. This was indeed the objective pursued by Andrea Rizzoli who decided to build it. The facilities of Milanello have often been used also by the Italian Football Federation for the preparation of the National Team‚Äôs important competitions, such as the European Championships in 1988, 1996 and 2000. At Milanello there are six regular pitches, 1 in synthetic grass (35 m x 30), 1 covered pitch with synthetic ground (42 m x 24) and a small-sized outdoor pitch in grass named \\"cage\\" because the playing field is surrounded by a 2,30 m high wall and topped by 2,5 m high fencing. Inside the cage, the play never stops, with the ball always in motion in order to enhance the speed of execution. A path running through the woods ca. 1,200 m long at various altitudes is used during the season for the players‚Äô physical training (running and biking) and for the recovery of injured players. The main building of the centre is a two-floor building (plus the basement) hosting the offices, the players‚Äô rooms, the chimney room, a TV-room, a pool-room; a bar, a kitchen, two dining-rooms, the press room, the meeting room, the laundry, the ironing-room and the medical centre. Next to the main building the \\"guest- quarters\\" are located, where a few players from the Youth Department also live. These youngsters, coming from various parts of Italy and from abroad too, go to school as all other teen-agers and in the afternoons attend their training sessions on the field made available to them.

A \\"rite of passage\\" song, \\"Tattoo\\" tells the story of two teenaged brothers who decide to get tattoos in their attempts to become men. Themes of the song include peer pressure to conform and young men's insecurity about their manhood. The song has been heavily praised by critics and has appeared on several of The Who's live and compilation albums. It has also been covered by Tommy Keene and Petra Haden. Lyrics and music \\"Tattoo\\" is a \\"rite of passage\\" song. The singer sings that he and his brother, as teenagers, were discussing \\"what makes a man a man.\\" They decided to get tattoos. Their father disapproved of the tattoos and beat the singer. However, his mother approved the singer's tattoo, which said \\"Mother,\\" but beat the brother because the brother got a tattoo of \\"a lady in the nude.\\" The song ends with the singer revealing that he now \\"tattooed all over\\" and his \\"wife is tattooed too\\". Themes of the song include peer pressure to conform and young men's insecurity about their manhood. Townshend has said that the inspiration for the song came from memories from the time he was about eleven or twelve years old of seeing men with tattoos all up and down their arms, and being concerned that that would happen to him eventually. Townshend originally did not expect Who lead singer Roger Daltrey to be willing to sing such a song about questioning one's manhood, and when Daltrey sang it, and well, Townshend realized that despite his bravado Daltrey shared many of the insecurities Townshend had. Townshend has also stated that the song was written as an album track at a time he had begun to feel that his guitar playing was being overshadowed by the likes of Jimi Hendrix and so he decided to start writing \\"a different kind of song...story-songs, cameos, essays on human experience.\\" \\"Tattoo\\" begins with arpeggios played on both electric and acoustic guitar. The song is mixed such that the electric guitar is heard only through the left stereo channel and the acoustic guitar is heard only through the right stereo channel. Author Chris Charlesworth describes the melody as being \\"particularly attractive and mature\\" and also comments on the \\"unusually complex rhymes\\" used. Authors Steve Grantley and Alan Parker praise Daltrey's vocal performance, noting that it \\"intrigues and seduces\\" and finds him projecting an uncharacteristically \\"passive, pensive mood.\\" Who author John Atkins praises the \\"immaculate\\" vocal harmonies and imaginative instrumentation. The Who recorded \\"Tattoo\\" on October 12, 1967 at IBC Studios. Critical reception Music critic Robert Christgau considers \\"Tattoo\\" one of his three favorite songs from The Who Sell Out, an album he considered The Who's \\"only great album\\" at the time, and one with \\"no bad songs.\\" Rolling Stone magazine considers \\"Tattoo\\" to be \\"one of those gems of guitar playing from Peter Townshend, one which shows flawless mastery of rock and roll chording.\\" Allmusic critic Richie Unterberger states that \\"Tattoo\\" \\"shows introspective, vulnerable sides to the singer/songwriter that had previously been hidden.\\" Charlesworth calls it a \\"standout track\\" and \\"one of [Townshend's] finest 'rite of passage' songs. Grantley and Parker note that \\"Tattoo\\" is \\"full of pathos\\" and \\"an excellent example of Townshend finding in the humdrum something of universal resonance and appeal.\\" Atkins, calling the song \\"masterly\\" puts forth similar views, and Atkins and Grantley and Parker all find that this element of the song is a characteristic that only The Kinks might be able to match. Other appearances \\"Tattoo\\" is one of Townshend's favorite songs, and it was included in The Who's live repertoire into the mid-1970s. Live versions of the song were released on the 1995 CD version of the 1970 album Live at Leeds and the video The Who At Kilburn: 1977 (although the performance on the video was actually from the London Coliseum). The song was also included on the compilation album Thirty Years of Maximum R&B.;. The song was also played occasionally on The Who Tour 1982 tour with Kenney Jones on drums. \\"Tattoo\\" has also been covered by Tommy Keene on The Real Underground and by Petra Haden on Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out.

The film, which was based on a screenplay by Robert Barr and Janet Green, was directed by Charles Frend and produced by Michael Balcon. It was shot on location in London and Snowdonia in North Wales. Two years later Hawkins would reprise a similar role in John Ford's Gideon's Day, a film based on the books of John Creasey. Plot When police respond to a burglar alarm at premises in Long Acre, central London they find nothing amiss after meeting the nightwatchman who allows them to search the premises. However, the next day the safe, which had been opened with a key, is found empty. Supt Tom Halliday (Jack Hawkins) and his new Detective Sergeant, Ward (John Stratton), begin searching for the fraudulent nightwatchman. Halliday deduces that the false nightwatchman has committed 14 safe-breaking jobs across the country, all against the same type of safe, and all with keys. Visiting the safe maker, Halliday gets the names of all current and former staff, but they are all cleared. When another safe is opened, a bystander is run over by the getaway car. The victim manages to pass limited information to the police before dying. The hit-and-run vehicle is found in a scrap yard. The car has been stolen from a Mrs Elliot. Inside they find a newspaper that leads them to a garage in north Wales and to a Mr Gilson, a deceased former employee of the safe maker. Halliday finds there are 28 further safes in London. He also finds out that the thief is being tipped off as to which safes have a lot of cash in them by an insurance agent. The police arrange with the owner of a safe in the Royal Festival Hall to let the insurance agent know about gala nights that generate a lot of cash. They tail the insurance agent to a meeting with Mrs Elliot, the woman whose car was stolen. However, she is identified as Mrs Gilson, the wife of the apparently dead safe key maker. Halliday and Ward deduce that Gilson faked his own death after spending years making duplicate keys (the third key) for all the safes his company produced. Gilson hits the Royal Festival Hall but the detectives are waiting. After a short scuffle, Mrs Gilson arrives in a sports car. Halliday jumps on the bonnet and breaks the windscreen as Ward chases down Gilson on foot. Both are arrested and the case is solved.

Due to the success of the discography A&M; released, the label garnered interest and was acquired by PolyGram in 1989 and began distributing releases from Polydor Ltd. from the UK. Throughout its operations, A&M; housed well-known acts such as Breathe, Gin Blossoms, Dishwalla, Joe Cocker, Procol Harum, Captain & Tennille, Sting, Sergio Mendes, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Supertramp, Bryan Adams, Burt Bacharach, Liza Minnelli, The Carpenters, Paul Williams, Quincy Jones, Janet Jackson, Cat Stevens, Peter Frampton, Elkie Brooks, Carole King, Styx, Extreme, Amy Grant, Joan Baez, the Human League, The Police, Jann Arden, CeCe Peniston, Shanice, Blues Traveler, Soundgarden, Duffy, and Sheryl Crow. PolyGram was acquired by Seagram and dissolved into Universal Music Group in 1998, and A&M;'s operations were ceased in January 1999 when it was merged with Geffen Records and Interscope Records to form the record company Interscope Geffen A&M; Records. In 2007, Interscope Geffen A&M; announced that A&M; was revived as trademark and brand and was to be merged with Octone Records to form A&M; Octone Records, which operated until 2013, when A&M; Octone was folded into Interscope. Today, A&M;'s catalog releases are managed by Verve Records, Universal Music Enterprises and Interscope. History Founding A&M; Records was formed in 1962 by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss. Their first choice for a name was Carnival Records, under which they released two singles before discovering that another label had already taken the Carnival name. The company was subsequently renamed A&M;, after Alpert's and Moss's initials. From 1966 to 1999, the company's headquarters were on the grounds of the historic Charlie Chaplin Studios at 1416 North La Brea Avenue, near Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. A&M; Studios Main Gate 1988 Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, A&M; had such acts as Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass, Baja Marimba Band, Burt Bacharach, S√©rgio Mendes & Brasil ‚Äô66, Ralph Williams/The Marauders, the Sandpipers, Boyce & Hart, We Five, the Carpenters, Chris Montez, Elkie Brooks, Lee Michaels, Captain and Tennille, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Quincy Jones, Lucille Starr, Stealers Wheel, Gallagher and Lyle, Barry DeVorzon, Perry Botkin, Jr., Marc Benno, Liza Minnelli, Rita Coolidge, Gino Vannelli, Wes Montgomery, Paul Desmond, Bobby Tench, Hummingbird, Toni Basil, and Paul Williams. Folk artists Joan Baez, Phil Ochs and Gene Clark also recorded for the label during the 1970s. Billy Preston joined the label in 1971, followed by Andre Popp and Herb Ohta in 1973. In the late 1960s, through direct signing and licensing agreements, A&M; added several British artists to its roster, including Cat Stevens, Joe Cocker, Procol Harum, Humble Pie, Fairport Convention, Free, the Move, Strawbs and Spooky Tooth. In the 1970s, under its manufacturing and distribution agreement with Ode Records, A&M; released albums by Carole King and the comedy duo Cheech & Chong. Other notable acts of the time included Nazareth, Y&T;, the Tubes, Styx, Supertramp, Joan Armatrading, Bell and James, Chris de Burgh (who went on to greater mainstream success in the 1980s), Rick Wakeman, the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Chuck Mangione, Squeeze, and Peter Frampton. On March 10, 1977, A&M; signed the Sex Pistols after the band had been dropped by EMI. However, A&M; dropped the band within a week. A&M; sustained its success during the 1980s with a roster of noted acts that included Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Henry Badowski, Janet Jackson, the Police, Sting, the Brothers Johnson, Falco, Atlantic Starr, the Go-Go's, Bryan Adams, Suzanne Vega, Righeira, Brenda Russell, Jeffrey Osborne, Oingo Boingo, the Human League, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Sharon, Lois & Bram, Annabel Lamb, Jim Diamond, Vital Signs, Joe Jackson, Charlie Peacock, and Scottish rock band Gun. They also, through a deal with Christian music label Myrrh, distributed back catalog recordings of Amy Grant as well as her new recordings, starting with 1985's Unguarded, to the mainstream marketplace, a vital component in her subsequent breakthrough as a mainstream artist. Within a decade of its inception, A&M; became the world's largest independent record company. A&M; releases were initially issued in the United Kingdom by EMI's Stateside Records label, and then under its own name by Pye Records, who released the first Herb Alpert records on the Pye International label before issuing the records on the A&M; label until 1967. From 1969, A&M; set up its own UK base appointing John Deacon (not to be confused with Queen's bass guitarist of the same name) as general manager, a post he held until 1979. Several A&R; men were recruited including Larry Yaskiel and Derek Green and major UK acts such as the Police, Supertramp, Rick Wakeman, Squeeze, Gallagher & Lyle, Elkie Brooks, the Strawbs and Peter Frampton as well as many others were all signed to the UK label. A&M; releases were also issued in Australia through Festival Records until 1989. A&M; Records Ltd. was established in 1970, with distribution handled by other labels with a presence in Europe. A&M; Records of Canada Ltd. was also formed in 1970, and A&M; Records of Europe in 1977. In 1979, A&M; entered a distribution agreement with RCA Records in the US, and with CBS Records in many other countries. Over the years, A&M; added specialty imprints: Almo International for middle of the road; Omen Records (1964‚Äì1966) for soul; Horizon Records for jazz (1974‚Äì1978); AyM Discos for Latin-American; Vendetta Records for dance music (1988‚Äì1990); and Tuff Break Records for hip-hop music (1993‚Äì1995).for hip hop music (1993-1995) Acquisition by PolyGram A&M; was bought by PolyGram in 1989. Alpert and Moss continued to manage the label until 1993. In 1998, Alpert and Moss sued PolyGram for breach of the integrity clause, eventually settling for an additional $200 million payment. In 1991, A&M; launched Perspective Records as a joint venture with producing team Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Jam and Lewis stepped down as CEOs of the imprint in 1997, but they remained on as consultants. In 1999, the label was absorbed into A&M.; In the mid-1990s, A&M; began distributing its PolyGram sister label Polydor Records in the US. During the 1990s, the company continued to release albums by Soundgarden, Extreme, Amy Grant, John Hiatt, Sting, Blues Traveler, Barry White, and Aaron Neville, as well as material from new artists Sheryl Crow, Monster Magnet, Therapy?, CeCe Peniston, Intelligent Hoodlum, Dred Scott, Ridel High and the Gin Blossoms. The company released the soundtracks Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, The Three Musketeers, Sabrina, The Living Sea, Demolition Man, and Lethal Weapon 3. Universal Music Group merging and Interscope Geffen A&M; In 1998, PolyGram was bought by Seagram and merged into Universal Music Group, which was formed in 1996 as the successor to MCA Music Entertainment Group, of which MCA Records had been the flagship. A&M; was subsequently merged into Universal Music Group's then newly formed Interscope Geffen A&M; label group. Its Canadian division was absorbed into Universal Music Canada at that time, which included Jann Arden alongside other artists from Canada. The A&M; lot on La Brea Avenue was shut down in January 1999. During the farewell celebration, the company's staff placed a black band over the A&M; sign above the main entrance, indicating the death of the company. The old A&M; studios and executive offices are now the home of the Jim Henson Company, which operates Henson Recording Studios. Most of the company's workforce, some of whom had been with the company for a decade or more, were let go while many of its artists were dropped. The label's more prominent acts such as Sting, Sheryl Crow, Bryan Adams and Chris Cornell, however would remain on its roster. In response to the down-sourcing, Al Cafaro stated, A&M; catalog albums that didn't fit the current pop music format (which also includes rock, rap and R&B;) of their new parent division were transferred to other Universal divisions for management - for example, Verve Records now manages A&M;'s jazz catalog, not including Herb Alpert's recorded output which Alpert acquired in the settlement with Universal Music (however, Verve does manage the Horizon Records catalog). Despite the shutdown, the A&M; name continued to be used on albums from artists like Snow Patrol, the Black Eyed Peas and Keyshia Cole‚Äîa result of Alpert and Moss's 1998 lawsuit‚Äîuntil February 2007, when Interscope-Geffen-A&M; partnered with Octone Records to relaunch the A&M; label fully. Now headed by James Diener and called A&M;/Octone Records with worldwide distribution handled by parent Universal Music Group, the existing Octone roster was transferred to the A&M;/Octone label and all newer artist signings were made under the A&M;/Octone joint venture. Acts that were already signed to the label before the merger with Octone, however, would remain on the main A&M; label. After six successful years of operation, in September 2013, Octone initiated its buy/sell rights in the joint venture, resulting in Interscope-Geffen-A&M; purchasing Octone Records' 50% interest in A&M;/Octone, absorbing and restructuring the artist roster into Interscope operations in 2014 as announced.

Freddoso was a political reporter for the website of the conservative magazine National Review when the book came out. He is now with the Washington Examiner. The book was published by Regnery Publishing. Freddoso said in an August 2008 interview that the book is an attempt to address what he sees as two wrong ways of considering Obama as a presidential candidate.

Jeremiah Wright. Part of the book focuses on Obama's having made accommodations with the Cook County Democratic Party, despite Obama's start in politics as a candidate appealing to reform-minded voters in the Hyde Park neighborhood of the city. The book dwells at length on Obama‚Äôs opposition to an Illinois bill that sought to protect infants ‚Äúborn alive,‚Äù but whose critics said it could have fundamentally undermined the right to abortion. A similar bill passed the United States Congress only after an explicit commitment to Roe v. Wade was added, which Freddoso dismisses as trivial, but which abortion rights advocates saw as crucial. Response Barack Obama presidential campaign A spokesman for Barack Obama's presidential campaign said the book, along with Jerome Corsi's biography, distorts the story of the candidate's life and his record. \\"These books are cut from the same cloth, made up of the same old debunked smears that have been floating around the Internet for months,\\" said spokesman Tommy Vietor.Wills, Christopher, \\"Two books, two styles, one target: Obama\\", Associated Press article, as published on USA Today website, August 15, 2008, retrieved January 18, 2015 On September 15, 2008, the Obama campaign mobilized its ‚ÄúObama Action Wire‚Äù sending an email out to Obama supporters urging them to complain to WGN Radio in Chicago after host Milt Rosenberg invited Freddoso on his show to discuss his book.Obama mobilizes rapid response on Web Reviews Ben Smith, a writer at The Politico, called the book the \\"first serious negative biography of Senator Barack Obama\\".

Sexual selection is a biological way one sex chooses a mate for the best reproductive success. Most compete with others of the same sex for the best mate to contribute their genome for future generations. This has shaped our evolution for many years, but reasons why humans choose their mates are hardly understood. Sexual selection is quite different in animals than humans as they feel more of the evolutionary pressures to reproduce and can easily reject a mate. The role of sexual selection in human evolution has not been firmly established although neoteny has been cited as being caused by human sexual selection.Neoteny and Two-Way Sexual Selection in Human Evolution: A Paleo-Anthropological Speculation on the Origins of Secondary- Sexual Traits, Male Nurturing and the Child as a Sexual Image It has been suggested that sexual selection played a part in the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain, i.e. the structures responsible for social intelligence underwent positive selection as a sexual ornamentation to be used in courtship rather than for survival itself,Sexual Selection and the Mind and that it has developed in ways outlined by Ronald Fisher in the Fisherian runaway model.Fisher, R.A. (1930) The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection. Edwards, A.W.F. (2000) Perspectives: Anecdotal, Historial and Critical Commentaries on Genetics. The Genetics Society of America (154) 1419:1426Andersson, M. (1994) Sexual selection. Andersson, M. and Simmons, L.W. (2006) Sexual selection and mate choice. Trends, Ecology and Evolution (21) 296:302Gayon, J. (2010) Sexual selection: Another Darwinian process. Comptes Rendus Biologies (333) 134:144 Fisher also stated that the development of sexual selection was \\"more favourable\\" in humans. General hypotheses Some hypotheses about the evolution of the human brain argue that it is a sexually selected trait, as it would not confer enough fitness in itself relative to its high maintenance costs (a quarter to a fifth of the energy and oxygen consumed by a human). Current consensus about the evolutionary development of the human brain accepts sexual selection as a potential contributing factor but maintains that human intelligence and the ability to store and share cultural knowledge would have likely carried high survival value as well. Sexual selection's role in human evolution cannot be definitively established, as features may result from an equilibrium among competing selective pressures, some involving sexual selection, others natural selection, and others pleiotropy. Richard Dawkins argued that : \\"When you notice a characteristic of an animal and ask what its Darwinian survival value is, you may be asking the wrong question. It could be that the characteristic you have picked out is not the one that matters. It may have \\"come along for the ride\\", dragged along in evolution by some other characteristic to which it is pleiotropically linked.\\" Darwin's sexual selection hypothesis Charles Darwin described sexual selection as depending on \\"the advantage which certain individuals have over others of the same sex and species, solely in respect of reproduction\\". Darwin noted that sexual selection is of two kinds and concluded that both kinds had operated on humans: \\"The sexual struggle is of two kinds; in the one it is between the individuals of the same sex, generally the male sex, in order to drive away or kill their rivals, the females remaining passive; whilst in the other, the struggle is likewise between the individuals of the same sex, in order to excite or charm those of the opposite sex, generally the females, which no longer remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners.\\" Charles Darwin conjectured that the male beard, as well as the hairlessness of humans compared to nearly all other mammals, were results of sexual selection. He reasoned that since the bodies of females are more nearly hairless, the loss of fur was due to sexual selection of females at a remote prehistoric time when males had overwhelming selective power, and that it nonetheless affected males due to genetic correlation between the sexes. He also hypothesized that contrasts in sexual selection acting along with natural selection were significant factors in the geographical differentiation in human appearance of some isolated groups, as he did not believe that natural selection alone provided a satisfactory answer. Although not explicit, his observation that in Khoisan women \\"the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner\\" (known as steatopygia) implies sexual selection for this characteristic. In The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, Darwin viewed many physical traits which vary around the world as being so trivial to survival that he concluded some input from sexual selection was required to account for their presence. He noted that variation in these features among the various peoples of the world meant human mate- choice criteria would also have to be quite different if the focus was similar, and he himself doubted that, citingDarwin, C. (1936) [1888]. The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. reprint of 2nd ed., The Modern Library, New York: Random House. reports indicating that ideals of beauty did not, in fact, vary in this way around the world. Sexual dimorphism The effects on the human brain formation during puberty is directly linked to hormones changes. The effects of hormones have been studied and have a border understanding than how the direct actions of the sex chromosome gene. The mismatch timing between biological puberty and age of social maturity in western society has a psychological expectation on children. With puberty, men are generally hairier than women, and Darwin was of the opinion that hairlessness was related to sexual selection; however, several other explanations have been advanced to explain human hairlessness, a leading one is loss of body hair to facilitate sweating.Jablonski, N. G. (2006). Skin: a natural history. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. p. PP13. This idea closely relates to that of the suggested need for increased photoprotection and is part of the most-commonly-accepted scientific explanation for the evolution of pigmentary traits. Indicating that a trait is under sexual selection can be difficult to prove through correlational methods, as characters may result from different selective pressures, some involving sexual selection, others natural selection, and some may be accidental and due to pleiotropy. For example, monogamous primates are known to typically exhibit little sexual dimorphism such as particularly large males armed with huge canines; however, powerful big-toothed males can provide protection against predators and may be bigger for that reason, rather than in order to win confrontations over females. Males and females differing in size can specialize in, and more fully exploit, different food resources while avoiding competing with each other; furthermore, body size can be useful in avoiding predators and may also be of assistance in securing a mate. This is further complicated by the consideration that with larger body size, the skeleton of mammals becomes much more robust and massive (relatively speaking).Evolution and Human Behavior: Darwinian Perspectives on Human Nature, by John Cartwright. Bearing these caveats in mind, levels of sexual dimorphism are generally seen as a marker of sexual selection. Studies have shown the earliest homininae were highly dimorphic and that this tendency lessened over the course of human evolution, suggesting humans have become more monogamous. In contrast, gorillas living in harems exhibit a much stronger sexual dimorphism (see: homininae).Principles of Human Evolution, by Roger Lewin, Robert Foley. Sexual anatomy The theory of sexual selection has been used to explain a number of human anatomical features. These include rounded breasts, facial hair, pubic hair and penis size. The breasts of primates are flat, yet are able to produce sufficient milk for feeding their young. The breasts of non-lactating human females are filled with fatty tissue and not milk. Thus it has been suggested the rounded female breasts are signals of fertility. Richard Dawkins has speculated that the loss of the penis bone in humans, when it is present in other primates, may be due to sexual selection by females looking for a clear sign of good health in prospective mates. Since a human erection relies on a hydraulic pumping system, erection failure is a sensitive early warning of certain kinds of physical and mental ill health. Homo has a thicker penis than the other great apes, though it is on average no longer than the chimpanzee's. It has been suggested the evolution of the human penis towards larger size was the result of female choice rather than sperm competition, which generally favors large testicles.Miller, G.F. (1998), \\"How mate choice shaped human nature: A review of sexual selection and human evolution\\" in Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology. However, penis size may have been subject to natural selection, rather than sexual selection, due to a larger penis' efficiency in displacing the sperm of rival males during sexual intercourse. A model study showed displacement of semen was directly proportional to the depth of pelvic thrusting, as an efficient semen displacement device.In a theoretical paper published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology in 2004, Gallup and coauthor, Rebecca Burch, conjecture that, \\"A longer penis would not only have been an advantage for leaving semen in a less-accessible part of the vagina, but by filling and expanding the vagina, it also would aid and abet the displacement of semen left by other males as a means of maximizing the likelihood of paternity.\\" ‚Äì \\"Secrets of the Phallus: Why Is the Penis Shaped Like That?\\", ScientificAmerican.com.  Selection preferences and biological drivers  There are a variety of factors that drive sexual selection in humans. Current available research indicates that selection preferences are biologically driven, that is, by the display of phenotypic traits that can be both consciously and unconsciously evaluated by the opposite sex to determine the health and fertility of a potential mate. This process can be affected, however, by social factors, including in cultures where arranged marriage is practiced, or psychosocial factors, such as valuing certain cultural traits of a mate, including a persons social status, or what is perceived to be an ideal partner in various cultures.  Selection preferences in females  Some of the factors that affect how females select their potential mates for reproduction include voice pitch, facial shape, muscular appearance, and height. Several studies suggest that there is a link between hormone levels and partner selection among humans. In a study measuring female attraction to males with varying levels of masculinity, it was established that women had a general masculinity preferences for men's voices, and that the preference for masculinity was greater in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle than in the non-fertile phase. There is further evidence from the same study that in fertile stages of the menstrual cycle, women also had a preference for other masculine traits such as body size, facial shape, and dominant behavior, which are indicators of both fertility and health. This study did not exclude males with feminine traits from being selected, however, as feminine traits in men indicate a higher probability of long-term relationship commitment, and may be one of several survival strategies. Further research also backs up the idea of using phenotypic traits as a means of assessing a potential mate's fitness for reproduction as well as assessing whether a partner has high genetic quality. Another factor affecting the selection process is the environment which the person inhabits. In biological terms, certain environmental conditions may bring about demands for or the disregarding of certain traits. One such example is a preference for males whose facial structure indicates certain hormonal ratios, such as testosterone-cortisol levels (sex and stress hormones). Research shows that, for example, in countries with varying Human Development Index (HDI) levels, females have different preferences for sex- stress hormone ratios, as expressed in the male's face. A Royal Society research showed a significant correlation between a measure of societal development and preferences for indication of lower testosterone levels, as manifested in facial features, and the interaction between preferences for testosterone and cortisol. It was concluded that societal-level ecological factors impact the valuation of traits by combinations of sex- and stress- hormones. A 2020 study reported that women tend to find a man more attractive if the man's previous relationships ended mutually, and less attractive if the man was dumped.  Selection preferences in males  Like their female counterparts, males also use visual information about a potential mate, as well as voice, body shape, and an assortment of other factors in selecting a partner. Research shows that males tend to prefer feminine women's faces and voices as opposed to women with masculine features in these categories. Furthermore, males also evaluate skin coloration, symmetry, and apparent health, as a means by which the select a partner for reproductive purposes. Males are particularly attracted to femininity in women's faces when their testosterone levels are at their highest, and the level of attraction to femininity may fluctuate as hormone levels fluctuate. Studies on men have also been done to show the effects of exogenous testosterone and its effects on attraction to femininity, and the results concluded that throughout several studies, men have shown decreased preference for feminine female faces in the long-term context, when given exogenous testosterone, but this difference did not occur with placebo.  Common preferences in either sex  Sexual selection preferences are general terms by which the mating and reproductive process are understood. As one article states, sexual selection is in essence a process which favors sexual displays for attraction, aggressiveness, dominance, size, and strength, and the ability to exclude competitors by force if necessary, or by using resources to win. Both male and female use voice, face, and other physical characteristics to assess a potential mate's ability to reproduce, as well as their health. Together with visual and chemical signals, these crucial characteristics which are likely to enhance the ability to produce offspring, as well as long term survival prospects, can be assessed and selections made. Phenotype Sexual selection has continued to be suggested as a possible explanation for geographical variation in appearance within the human species; in modern hypotheses, marriage practices are proposed as the main determinant of sexual selection. John Manning suggests that where polygyny is common, men face intense competition for wives and are more likely to be completely unsuccessful in reproducing, and the result is strong selection of males for traits which are adaptive for successful reproduction. He proposes a link to skin color through selection of males for testosterone-mediated traits which confer an ability to successfully compete for females. He suggests testosterone makes the human immune system less competent to resist pathogens. In this view the antimicrobial properties of melanin help mitigate the susceptibility to disease that polygyny induces by increasing testosteronization. According to this argument, the anti-infective qualities of melanin were more important than protection from ultraviolet light in the evolution of the darkest skin types. Manning asserts that skin color is more correlated with the occurrence of polygyny ‚Äì explicable by it having an antimicrobial function ‚Äì than the latitudinal gradient in intensity of ultraviolet radiation, and he points to the lack of very dark skin at equatorial latitudes of the New World and the relatively light skin of Khoisan people in Africa. Research seems to contradict Manning's explanation about skin color. In 1978, NASA launched the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, which was able to measure the ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth's surface. Jablonski and Chaplin took the spectrometer's global ultraviolet measurements and compared them with published data on skin color in indigenous populations from more than 50 countries. There was an unmistakable correlation: The weaker the ultraviolet light, the fairer the skin. Rogers et al. (2004) performed an examination of the variation in MC1R nucleotide sequences for people of different ancestry and compared the sequences of chimpanzees and humans from various regions of the Earth. Rogers concluded that, at the time of the evolutionary separation of chimpanzees and humans, the common ancestors of all humans had light skin that was covered by dark hair. Additionally, our closest extant relative, the chimpanzee, has light skin covered by thick body hair. Over time human hair disappeared to allow better heat dissipation through sweating and the skin tone grew darker to increase the epidermal permeability barrier and protect from folate depletion due to the increased exposure to sunlight. When humans started to migrate away from the tropics, there was less-intense sunlight, partly due to clothing to protect against cold weather. Under these conditions there was less photodestruction of folate, and so the evolutionary pressure stopping lighter-skinned gene variants from surviving was reduced. In addition, lighter skin is able to generate more vitamin D (cholecalciferol) than darker skin, so it would have represented a health benefit in reduced sunlight if there were limited sources of vitamin D. The genetic mutations leading to light skin may have experienced selective pressure due to the adoption of farming and settlement in northern latitudes. Anthropologist Peter Frost has proposed that sexual selection was responsible for the evolution of pigmentary traits of women in Northern and Eastern European populations. He contends that the diversity of hair and eye color in Northeast European populations originated as a consequence of intense female intrasexual competition, and is an adaptation for reproductive success in women. Geoffrey Miller hypothesis Homo habilis ‚Äì forensic facial reconstruction Geoffrey Miller, drawing on some of Darwin's largely neglected ideas about human behavior, has hypothesized that many human behaviors not clearly tied to survival benefits, such as humor, music, visual art, some forms of altruism, verbal creativity or the fact that most humans have a far greater vocabulary than that which is required for survival,Geoffrey Miller, The Mating Mind, p.111; published 2001 Miller (2000) has proposed that this apparent redundancy is due to individuals using vocabulary to demonstrate their intelligence, and consequently their \\"fitness\\", to potential mates. This has been tested experimentally, and it appears that males do make greater use of lower-frequency (more unusual) words when in a romantic mindset compared to a non-romantic mindset, suggesting that vocabulary is likely to be used as a sexual display (Rosenberg & Tunney, 2008). All these qualities are considered courtship adaptations that have been favored through sexual selection. Miller is critical of theories that imply that human culture arose as accidents or by-products of human evolution. He believes that human culture arose through sexual selection for creative traits. In that view, many human artifacts could be considered subject to sexual selection as part of the extended phenotype, for instance clothing that enhances sexually selected traits.Miller G. (2000). The mating mind: how sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature, London, Heineman, (also Doubleday, ). During human evolution, on at least two occasions, hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time followed by a period of stasis. The first period of brain expansion occurred 2.5 million years ago, when Homo habilis first began using stone tools. The second period occurred 500,000 years ago, with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens. Miller argues that the rapid increases in brain size would have occurred by a positive feedback loop resulting in a Fisherian runaway selection for larger brains. Tor N√∏rretranders, in The Generous Man conjectures how intelligence, musicality, artistic and social skills, and language might have evolved as an example of the handicap principle, analogously with the peacock's tail, the standard example of that principle. Opposing arguments The role of sexual selection in human evolution has been considered controversial from the moment of publication of Darwin's book on sexual selection (1871). Among his vocal critics were some of Darwin's supporters, such as Alfred Wallace, who argued that animals and birds do not choose mates based on their beauty or fine plumages, and that the artistic faculties in humans belong to their spiritual nature and therefore cannot be connected to natural selection, which only affects the animal nature. Darwin was accused of looking to the evolution of early human ancestors through the moral codes of the 19th century Victorian society. Joan Roughgarden, citing elements of sexual behavior in animals and humans that cannot be explained by the sexual-selection model, suggested that the function of sex in human evolution was primarily social.Roughgarden, Joan (2004). Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender and Sexuality in Nature and People. Los Angeles: University of California Press. Joseph Jordania suggested in 2011 that in explaining such human morphological and behavioral characteristics as singing, dancing, body painting, wearing of clothes, Darwin and proponents of sexual selection neglect another important evolutionary force, intimidation of predators and competitors with the ritualized forms of warning display, which uses the same arsenal of visual, audio, olfactory and behavioral features as sexual selection. According to Jordania, most of these warning displays were incorrectly attributed to the forces of sexual selection. Jordania proposed an aposematic model of human evolution, where most of the human morphological and behavioral features that had been considered by Darwin as the result of sexual selection, via female choice, are explained by the aposematic (intimidating) display.

Foundation SPYL came into existence in 1969 after the SWAPO Tanga Consultative Congress in Tanzania adopted a new constitution. In 1971, the International Court of Justice declared South African occupation of Namibia as illegal. At that time there existed pervasive disgruntlement in the country due to the Odendaal Plan that was going to initiate a homelands policy. The Youth league protested at major colleges and schools and participated at the general strike of 1971 and 1972, a major turning point in the Namibian fight for independence. There was also a schools' boycott in northern Namibia in 1973 against the Bantustan policy. These activities resulted in the arrest and imprisonment at Robben Island of many youth leaders, including Nashilongo Taapopi, Jerry Ekandjo and Martin Kapewasha among others. Once the Portuguese revolution struck in May 1974, it was possible for Namibian youth to leave the country via Angola. Thousands of youth left Namibia between May and December 1974 to join SWAPO abroad, majority ended up serving in the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). Youth activist Keshii Pelao Nathanael, was the leader of the internal radical youth inside the country. He and his youth group members orchestrated most of these strikes.

Biography Early career Craan was born in the Dutch East Indies, a colony of the Dutch East India Company in those days. He was the son of Jacobus Johannes Craan and Johanna Henri√´tte Breekpot. His father was an opperkoopman (chief merchant), employed by the company. He married Joanna Frederika Hahn on 4 October 1795 in Hillegom. Craan studied at Leiden University and obtained a doctorate in law on 27 August 1795 (the Batavian Republic had just been established). He was not very interested in the law profession, however, dedicating himself in the next fifteen years to mathematical studies and music.Heuschling, p. 74 When he found himself in Aix- la-Chapelle in December, 1810, he was appointed by the local prefect to the position of cadastral surveyor for the d√©partement de la Roer (one of the d√©partements of the First French Empire to which the Netherlands had by then been annexedThe fact that the French state defaulted on the public debt of the former Netherlands state, causing the instant evaporation of much of the wealth of the bondholders, may have had something to do with Craan's sudden interest in gainful employment. See Financial history of the Dutch Republic). He performed so well in this function that the next year he was promoted and put in charge of the Cadastre of the d√©partement de la Lippe (in Germany). The fall of the Empire in 1814 put him out of work, so he travelled to Brussels, then the capital of the former Austrian Netherlands, which now were about to become part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands (the future king William I of the Netherlands) appointed him as chief of the Cadastre of the department of the Dyle on 21 October 1814.Heuschling, p. 75 Map of the Battle of Waterloo On 18 June 1815 the Battle of Waterloo was fought. As the battlefield was close to Brussels, and many wounded of all armies were taken to that city, Craan was able to interview many prominent French and Allied wounded officers about their experiences during the battle. On the basis of information gained in this way he published a detailed map of the battle, with an explanatory note in September 1816, under the title Plan du champ de bataille de Waterloo, avec notice historique. In the explanatory note he mentions the names of generals Mouton, Lobau, Excelmans and G√©rard on the French side. He also mentions a number of high British, Dutch-Belgian and Prussian officers, though he does not give their names. Colonel Fran√ßois Aim√© Mellinet (chief-of-staff of the Young Guard DivisionSoci√©t√© des bibliophiles bretons et de l'histoire de Bretagne, Nantes, Revue de Bretagne, de Vend√©e & d'Anjou. Vols. 17-18 (1897), p. 268) advised him on the map, as did \\"a number of Prussian generals\\" to whom he was introduced by Prince Frederick of the Netherlands. The Prince of Orange, who had commanded an army corps at the battle later viewed the map and approved of it (as did the Duke of WellingtonWellington, Supplementary Despatches, vol. X, p. 513). Finally, Emperor Alexander I of Russia was so enamored of the map that he presented Craan with a precious ring.Heuschling, pp. 78-82 The map and explanatory note are still relevant, because they contradict a number of \\"facts\\" that have been assumed by many historians about the battle. For instance, though in many accounts of the battle the Dutch- Belgian Bijlandt brigade is assumed to have stood in front of a ridge (and so exposed to the opening bombardment of the French artillery), Craan's map shows the brigade behind the ridge (which is commensurate with the after-battle report of the chief-of-staff of the 2nd Netherlands Division, of which the Bijlandt brigade was a partsee (1993) Waterloo. New Perspectives. The Great Battle Reappraised, John Wiley & sons, , p. 26, for this controversy). Introduction of Lithography Craan is also credited with having introduced the printing technique of Lithography in Belgium in 1817. A brother of the inventor of the technique, Alois Senefelder, visited Brussels in that year. He soon left for The Hague, but left his son-in-law and together with that gentleman Craan put the new print shop on a sure footing. This helped convince the minister of Public Education, Anton Reinhard Falck, of its value. Though Craan soon shifted his attention to other subjects, this early support helped to establish the technique in Belgium.Heuschling, pp. 76-78 City plan of Brussels and other scientific contributions In the 18th century the science of surveying made rapid advances, and many countries were completely overlaid with triangles, using the surveying method of triangulation. In the United Kingdom of the Netherlands such a survey was partially completed by general Krayenhoff, but the Belgian Revolution prevented its completion in Belgium. Craan helped to give new impetus to this effort. His main contribution was his Plan g√©om√©trique de la ville de Bruxelles avec ses faubourgs et communes limitrophes (in 4 folios, 1836). He had made the measurements for this city plan already in 1821.Heuschling, pp. 86-87 Craan also helped establish the first series of meteorological measurements in Belgium by starting barometric soundings on the steeple of the Brussels city hall in 1825.Heusling, p. 90 Craan died in 1848, survived by a wife and daughter: Virginie Frederique Wilhelmine Aspasia. The latter, known in Brussels as la belle hollandaise, was married to major-general Willem Frederik van Bylandt, the commander of the Bijlandt brigade at Waterloo.Heuschling, p. 75; References Sources * \\"Craan (Willem Benjamin)\\", in: Nouvelle biographie g√©n√©rale depuis les temps les plus recul√©s jusqu'√† nos jours, avec les renseignements bibliographiques et l'indication des sources √° consulter.

The show was a panel game much in the vein of an earlier game show called Make the Connection, where two people with a specific connection would play against the panel. 3rd Degree was hosted by Bert Convy, who co-created and produced the series along with his production partner Burt Reynolds. Bob Hilton was the announcer, with Don Morrow and Michael Hanks substituting for brief periods. The series was taped at Television City Studios in Hollywood, California. John C. Mula was the art director. 3rd Degree was a production of Burt and Bert Productions and Kline & Friends Productions, the same team behind the game show Win, Lose or Draw. The series was produced in association with Lorimar Television and distributed by Warner Bros. Television Distribution. This was the last game show Convy would host, as he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer toward the end of 3rd Degree's run and died in July 1991. Premise A panel of four celebrities who were split into two teams (two men, two women) faced a team of two or more contestants who have a special relationship between them. Two rounds were played for each civilian team; in each round, each team of celebrities had a limited time to question the contestants (or give them \\"the third degree\\", hence the name of the show). In the first round, each team of celebrities had one minute to question the contestants, and in the second round, the time was cut to 30 seconds. When the time was up, the celebrity team in control then got to guess the relationship (or when Bert Convy asked the question, \\"What's the relationship?\\" when they were getting close to the correct relationship). An incorrect guess awarded $250 to the contestants, and stumping the panel completely won $2,000 total, which includes a $1,000 bonus. Notable contestants *I Love Lucy writers Madelyn Pugh Davis and Bob Carroll, Jr. appeared as contestants on the show's premiere, and successfully stumped the panel to win the $2,000 top payoff. *Later in the premiere week, famed film composers Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman appeared as contestants and completely stumped the panel, who failed to identify them as having written \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" (from the 1964 Disney film Mary Poppins). *Michael Burger, then host of Straight to the Heart, and David Ruprecht of Supermarket Sweep appeared on the show as contestants. *Don Messick and Lucille Bliss appeared as contestants on the show, and the panel knew after the first minute that they were voice actors from the Smurfs. Don and Lucille had to settle for parting gifts on the show, but did the voices of Papa Smurf and Smurfette, respectively, when heading off to a commercial break. *Henry Corden and Jean Vander Pyl were featured as contestants, with the panel successfully identifying them as the voices of Fred Flintstone and Wilma from The Flintstones, respectively. The panel figured out their relationship halfway through the second round, after the pair had won $500. *Thurl Ravenscroft, who did the voice of Tony the Tiger for Frosted Flakes cereal commercials, was a contestant on the show, and he and his teammate stumped the panel and won $2,000. *A team of four men, all of whom played the character Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th movies, were contestants and stumped the panel to win $2,000. *One team attempted to perform a magic trick by sawing Bert Convy in half. *Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin were contestants on the show and ran footage of Bigfoot that they spotted. *Two cooks who worked for Elvis Presley appeared on the show, and shared one of his favorite snacks with the panel. *Two rodeo clowns lost early when celebrity panelist Marsha Warfield correctly guessed their job completely at random. Dispute When 3rd Degree went to pilot, Peter Marshall was brought in to be the host. After the series was picked up for syndication, however, co-producer Bert Convy decided to leave his position as the host of the syndicated edition of Win, Lose or Draw and take Marshall's place on 3rd Degree. Marshall filed a lawsuit against Convy for the action, but later dropped it after Convy's cancer diagnosis was made public.

Because of its unique architecture and importance to the history of Bend, the Reid School is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Bend's first schoolhouse was opened in 1887. It was located in an abandoned cabin near the Deschutes River in what is now Drake Park. That schoolhouse was replaced in 1904 by a three-story wood-frame school building located at the north end of Bend's downtown area, near where the Deschutes County Court House is located today.

In 1913, the people of Bend passed a school bond issue that provided $23,000 for the purchase of property and the construction of a modern public school. The school district purchased several downtown lots on the corner of Wall Street and Idaho Avenue from The Bend Company, and one adjacent lot from a local family, to create a building site. A three-story school was built on the site in 1914. The new school accommodated students from first grade through high school. It was named in honor of Ruth Reid, and she continued as principal in the new school, overseeing 241 students. Because the Great Northern and Union Pacific railroads had opened routes into Central Oregon in 1911, the community was growing rapidly. As a result, 42 of the 241 children who attended the Reid School in 1914 were new students.

Structure  The Reid School's imposing front entrance The Reid School is a classic Richardsonian Romanesque building designed by Sweatt, Levesque and Company, an architecture firm from Spokane, Washington. Ed and George Brosterhous were the general contractors who supervised the school's construction. The school was built in the center of a parcel in downtown Bend, facing Idaho Avenue. It is surrounded by lawn with concrete walkways leading to the front door. There are a number of large Ponderosa pine trees that shade the grounds, giving the area a park-like atmosphere. The school is a three-story rectangular structure, with a footprint measuring by . The building rests on a concrete foundation. The structure itself was constructed of locally quarried pink volcanic tuff. However, the original pinkish color has weathered to a light brown. The central feature of the building's facade is its entryway. The imposing double- leaf doors are recessed from the front wall in a shallow vestibule. The entry is flanked on the first floor by three classroom windows on each side. The second and third story facade is dominated by tall windows with fixed panes. The roof is covered with built-up asphalt. The Reid School was built as a modern education facility with ten classrooms, an auditorium, a central heating system, built-in electric clocks, drinking fountains, indoor plumbing, and an external fire escape system. The interior of the school is characterized by high ceilings, steep stairways, and large high-bay windows that provide natural light to the classrooms. The interior walls are lath and plaster, and are still in good condition. The original doors, moldings, and window casings are also in good condition. The original plumbing fixtures are still in use. The original boiler heating system is intact, but is no longer used.  Ruth Reid Overturf  Reid School's namesake, Ruth Reid, was born in New Brunswick, Canada. She came to Bend in 1904 to teach school. Besides becoming Bend's first school principal, she helped found the city's high school in 1908.\\"Who was Ruth Reid? - Popular teacher created Bend's first high school\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 26 December 2016. In 1910, Miss Reid married Harley J. Overturf, the office manager for the Drake Development Company.

Once A Million Worlds dissolved, Jason and Gary began a new band‚Äîthe Katies‚Äînamed after Jason's sister in-law. The duo recruited friends from local band Fluid Ounces for their rhythm section and began playing gigs around town, but didn't achieve a permanent lineup until Moore's younger brother Josh was recruited as their drummer. The first lineup of the band featured Fluid Ounces members Seth Timbs (piano) and Sam Baker (drums), and Mac Burrus (guitar.) Jason and Mac had previously been in Murfreesboro rock band The Plain. The band played with this lineup for a few shows around Murfreesboro. Eventually, Seth Timbs and Sam Baker bowed out to concentrate on Fluid Ounces, so the band continued with Jason Moore, Gary Welch, and Mac Burrus. After a terrible accident which resulted in Mac breaking his neck, the band was put on hold. Around this time, Jason convinced his younger brother, Josh, to leave their hometown of Clinton, Tennessee and move to Murfreesboro‚Äîto play drums for the Katies‚Äîas soon as he graduated high-school. While waiting for Josh to graduate, the band continued to play sporadic dates around Murfreesboro and Nashville, with Mac Burrus now playing a Fender Rhodes. Mac eventually left the band, accepting an offer to play bass for Matt Mahaffey's band, Self. With Josh now living in Murfreesboro, the band's sound grew‚Äîand changed‚Äîas a power trio. With Jason's sugary-sweet, instantly memorable hooks, Gary's fuzzed-out bass and distinctive harmonies, and Josh's ferocious drumming, the band began writing their own brand of radio-friendly, melodic power pop-influenced as much by classic rock bands like the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and The Heartbreakers‚Äîas they were by more contemporary bands like The Pixies and Supergrass. Lyrically, Jason set himself apart from his contemporaries by writing about decidedly personal themes like spirituality and the love for his wife. The band began to make a name for themselves around town and started to draw a following, playing with local bands like Self, The Features, and Fluid Ounces. The Katies then cut a series of demos with local producer Brian Carter (now referred to as The Carter Sessions). These demos caught the ear of Rick Williams, who had just launched local indie label Spongebath Records, along with Matt Mahaffey and Seth Timbs. Williams eventually signed the band to Spongebath. The band then recorded another batch of demos with Carter (The Carter Sessions Volume 2). These demos, along with the band's ear-splitting and energetic live show, resulted in major label interest. The band ultimately inked a deal that would give both Elektra Records and Spongebath a co-label release for the Katies' major label debut. The band recorded their debut album, The Katies, in 1998 with Nashville producer Joe Baldridge at the helm. Their first single, \\"Noggin' Poundin',\\" was a strong, crowd-favorite album track with as radio- ready a chorus Elektra could have asked for. The album was released on July 13, 1999, the same day as labelmates Self-released Breakfast with Girls. To celebrate the co-releases, the band played a sold-out, widely bootlegged show with Self at Nashville club The Exit/In. Although reviews for The Katies (and the \\"Noggin' Poundin'\\" single itself) were universally positive, neither Spongebath nor Elektra marketed or promoted the album effectively, and sales were lackluster. However, the band continued to tour tirelessly around the Southeast, promoting the album and continuing to write and record. They had a minor radio hit with the infectious single \\"Noggin' Poundin.\\" During this time, the Katies opened for bands like The Verve Pipe and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the aftermath of the album release, Elektra dropped the band, and the Katies ultimately left Spongebath Records. The band continued to gig and recorded more promising demos with Brent Rawlings, whose brother, Jason, was the drummer for Self. In 2001, the band recorded a new EP with Matt Mahaffey at his studio in Los Angeles (which was released as the EP \\"Blue\\" in April of 2020). Encouraged by Matt and the positive response to their EP, the band relocated to Los Angeles permanently. After a year of playing shows in the L.A. area, Gary Welch, missing his family and son, decided to move back to Tennessee. Jason and Josh, however, decided to stay in L.A and formed a band called WhenBreathingStops with Shawn Brock and Shawn Turner. The Katies, essentially, had ended. By 2005, both Jason and Josh had moved back to the Nashville area as well. In August, the band officially reunited (with auxiliary guitarist Joey Campbell) at a memorial tribute for their friend, Self guitarist Mike Mahaffey. The experience was so memorable that the band reunited and continued to gig around Nashville and Murfreesboro as a quartet. After a brief return to the Nashville rock scene, the band had dissolved again by 2006, with Welch fronting new band SJ & The Props, and the Moore brothers continuing to play together in various projects. The Katies reformed in 2017 and began releasing singles while working on a future album. Critical Acclaim Tom Demalon from Allmusic praised their debut, saying > The Murfreesboro, TN trio the Katies -- consisting of brothers Jason and > Joshua Moore on vocals/guitar and drums, and Gary Welch on bass -- takes the > best elements of melodic hard rock and alternative pop to create an > arresting debut.

Nobili cellular automata are the invention of Renato Nobili, a professor of physics at the University of Padova in Padova, Italy. Von Neumann specifically excluded the use of states dedicated to the crossing of signal. The confluent state is altered, so that it acts as a signal crossing organ if exactly two signal paths are incident (they enter and leave the confluent state), or acts as a memory organ if only inputs exist. The benefit of these alterations to the state set of von Neumann cellular automata is that signal crossing is greatly eased, configurations are slightly smaller than the corresponding configuration of von Neumann cellular automata, and the computational throughput is increased. Signal crossing in vNCA In von Neumann's original cellular automaton, the crossing of signals is much more difficult. The most widely used signal crossing organs are the coded channel (devised by von Neumann himself), Gorman's real-time crossing organ, and the Mukhopadhyay crossing organ. The coded channel can only cross individual pulses; the others are capable of crossing entire packets without interference, analogous the crossing organ in Nobili's cellular automaton. The Mukhopadhyay crossing organ comprises three XOR gates, in the arrangement shown (left). Schematic of the Mukhopadhyay crossing organ, showing the three exclusive-or gates. Signal crossing in NCA In Nobili cellular automaton, a signal crossing organ consists of a single confluent cell, with two perpendicular input paths and two perpendicular output paths. Due to the substantially reduced size (as compared with any of the vNCA crossing organs), self-replicating machines are much more compact in NCA. For example, the smallest replicator so far, ŒªG, comprises only 485 somatic cells. Memory storage in vNCA Storing memory in vNCA can be done in multiple ways. One of these (the electronic method) is to create a loop of OTS cells with an excited pulse travelling around it. By far the most common way (the electro-mechanical method) is to use a special transmission state to construct and delete an ordinary transmission state, to act as a gate. Slight modifications can yield a plethora of different gates, including latches, pulse dividers, and one-time gates. Memory storage in NCA In Nobili's cellular automaton, this task is also simplified. A confluent cell with no outputs 'holds' a pulse of excitation until an output is created. In the diagram of ŒªG above, the excited confluent cell is displayed in orange. It will remain in this state until an adjacent OTS cell is created, at which point the information will flow into the next confluent cell.

Gertrude succeeded her father as countess on his death in 1212, at which time she had already married Theobald, soon to be Duke of Lorraine (1213), according to the Vit√¶ Odili√¶. Their betrothal occurred in September 1205, possibly when she was an infant. On her marriage her husband took over the administration of her inheritance, but he died in early 1220 without siring any children. In May 1220 she married Theobald IV of Champagne, who was only an adolescent, against the wishes of the Emperor Frederick II. In 1222 Theobald repudiated her for either consanguinity (following Alberic of Trois-Fontaines) or sterility (according to Richer of Senones). In 1224 she married a third time to Simon III, count of Leiningen, but she died within a year. She was buried in the abbey of Sturzelbronn. Her husband inherited her county.

O. Chidambaram College (commonly known as VOC College) is a college of arts and sciences in Tuticorin, (Thoothukudi), a southern city of Tamil Nadu, India. The college, founded by Kulapathi A. P. C. Veerabahu in 1951, has been recognized by UGC under the 12(b) and 2(f). It is a postgraduate and research centre affiliated to Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli. It offers undergraduate courses, postgraduate courses, and research courses. Managed by V. O. Chidambaram Educational Society, the college provides higher education to the economically and gender-wise discriminated sections hailing from the backward areas of southern districts of Tamilnadu, India.  Origin  It was in the year 1945, a committee was constituted to commemorate the sacrifice of the first Swadeshi navigator and freedom fighter V. O. Chidambaram Pillai. The following philanthropists were on the committee: Shri. M. V. Sundaravel (President) Shri. A. P. C. Veerabahu (Secretary) Shri. M. Venkatakrishnan (Member) Shri. M. C. Veerabahu (Member) Shri. P. Kandasamy (Member) Of the committee members, M.Venkatakrishnan, M.C.Veerabahu and P.Kandasamy were staunch freedom fighters and their presence in the committee provided a nationalistic perspective to the other members. The committee first thought of building a monument to the late freedom fighter \\"Chekkilutha Chemmal\\", V. O. Chidambaram Pillai and so planned a Town Hall or a big Library. At that moment Dr. A. L. Mudaliar, the then Vice Chancellor of Madras University had appealed to Philanthropists all over Tamil Nadu to start colleges in unrepresented areas. Spurred by this news, himself a graduate Shri. A. P. C. Veerabahu realizing the importance of education in empowering people of \\"Nava Bharath\\" mooted the idea of establishing an educational institution for men. At first, the proposal received a cautious response from the majority of the members of the committee. But it was the veteran freedom fighter and member of the constituent assembly Shri. M. C. Veerabahu who readily appreciated the suggestion of Shri. A. P. C. Veerabahu and offered his full support to establish the educational institution. The other members saw wisdom in his unconditional support and wholeheartedly endorsed and thus came into being V. O. Chidambaram Educational Society constituted by the above-mentioned five luminaries. In 1946, V. O. Chidambaram Memorial fund raising was begun. This laudable move was blessed by the renowned statesman Chakaravarthi Rajaji. Later V. O. C. Educational society was constituted in 1947 to provide higher education for the benefit of the young especially the poor in and around Thoothukudi. Inception After clearing several hurdles, our founder secretary, Shri. A. P. C. Veerabahu was able to arrange for the inception of our college. Shri. P. Kumarasamy Raja, the then Chief Minister of Madras State, laid the foundation stone of the college in 1947. Affiliated to the then Madras University, a number of under graduate courses were started in various disciplines. Five hostels, including the three that were built within the campus provided stay to the outstation students of the college. In 1966, the College was affiliated to the newly born Madurai University. In the post 1966 period, this college emerged as a post-graduate centre with the introduction of P.G courses in several disciplines like English and Chemistry. At that time, this college was the largest college in Madurai University area for many years in terms of student strength. A Central Hall with gallery and an architecturally elegant Auditorium were later built in the college to organise seminars and cultural programmes. Silver Jubilee Recognizing the research activities going on in this college, the SPIC has put up a Research Centre namely SPIC Research Centre within the college campus to house all the research activities under one roof in commemoration of the Silver Jubilee Celebration of Southern Petrol Chemical Industries Corporation. A big separate library building was constructed recently and its holdings run to 54,367 volumes and it subscribes to 76 journals and periodicals. At present 1300 students are studying in this college. The college is offering 11 under graduate courses 9 post graduate courses and 3 M. Phil courses. 116 Teachers and 42 Non-teaching staff are working in the college. The college is now affiliated to Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli. In consonance with the wish of its Founder that the infrastructure of the college should be utilized to its optimum level the V. O. Chidambaram Evening College was started. Graduate and Post graduate courses are conducted in subjects like Commerce, Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, Banking Management and Computer Science. Three modern Computer Laboratories with centralized air conditioning have been the latest additions to the infrastructure of this college.

In 1972, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi felt that Gaafar Nimeiry of Sudan had betrayed the Arab cause by signing the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement ending the first Sudanese civil war. He established a base at Ma'tan as-Sarra to stockpile weapons and as a staging area for Sudanese insurgents, who were trained at the bases in Joudaim and Ma'sar Ra's near Tripoli.Burr and Collins, 2006, p. 137 In July 1976, one thousand followers of Sudanese opposition leader Sadiq al-Mahdi left the oasis and stormed Khartoum after crossing northern Darfur and Kordofan.

It is also widely known under the Latin name Photuris pennsylvanica, although the original spelling, with one \\"n\\", was common in Latinized names of the time and remains the valid name. Description P. pensylvanica is a somewhat flattened beetle to in length. Its primary color is black, but it has two bright red eyespots on its thorax, as well as yellow edging on its thorax and wing cases and usually a lengthwise yellow stripe partway down the center of each of the latter. The species is carnivorous, feeding mostly on insects but also on other invertebrates, such as land snails and earthworms. The terminal segments of its abdomen are white- yellow and glow greenish-yellow when the insect manifests its bioluminescence. The females of this species, like those of other members of the genus, lure males of other species by imitating their flash patterns in order to prey on them. State insect In 1974, P. pensylvanica was designated the state insect of Pennsylvania. Its designation as such started with a group of Highland Park Elementary School students in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. Fireflies are abundant in Pennsylvania and are enjoyed for their ability to \\"transform a midsummer night into a fairyland of tiny, brilliant twinkling lights\\" Discovering that there was a species of firefly named after their state and that no other U.S. state had adopted a firefly as its state insect, the students began their campaign to have P. pensylvanica made Pennsylvania's state insect. With advice and support from state legislators, the students began a campaign that included letter writing, the circulation of petitions, and the distribution of bumper stickers. On April 10, 1974, Governor Milton J. Shapp signed Act 59 into law, making the Pennsylvania firefly their state's official insect. A few years later, Highland Park Elementary School was presented with a bronze plaque in honor of the students' achievement. Many Pennsylvanians know these insects by the name \\"lightning bugs\\" and may have confused \\"firefly\\" with \\"black fly\\" when that state was plagued by them in 1988. This might be why that year the legislature again confirmed the Pennsylvania firefly's official status and specified it by scientific name. The amended act reads: > Section 1. The firefly (Lampyridae Coleoptera) of the species Photuris > pensylvanica De Geer is hereby selected, designated and adopted as the > official insect of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (1 amended Dec. 5, > 1988, P.L.1101, No.130) The firefly is also the state insect of Tennessee, but in this case the specific species referred to (if any) may be Photinus pyralis, the most common species of firefly in North America.

Biography Evans was born on 31 March 1912 in Columbus, Ohio to Marshall B. Evans, a scholar of the German language at Ohio State University. Gwynne graduated from that university in 1934. He then earned a master's degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1936. He received his doctorate from Harvard University in 1940. In 2000 Albright College awarded him an LL. D., honoris causa. During World War II, Evans served at Bletchley Park in England, a centre of Allied spying and decoding. After the war, Evans became a professor of English literature, working at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Illinois, and finally Harvard, where he became Cabot Professor. Evan's first book was The Plays and Poems of William Cartwright (1951), an edition of the obscure poet and playwright William Cartwright. He also edited Shakespearean Prompt-Books of the 17th Century (1960‚Äì80), a series of editions of rare promptbooks. His popular edition of Shakespeare's complete works, the Riverside Shakespeare, was published in 1974 by Houghton Mifflin, and remained the standard text of Shakespeare's works in university classrooms for the next quarter century. Evans co-edited an updated version in 1997. He also edited Richard III for the New Penguin Shakespeare and Romeo and Juliet for the New Cambridge Shakespeare. Evans's teaching style was simple and peculiarly effective. Working through Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, he offered quiet comment, but did so on the move, walking around the front of the class in a way that strangely contributed to one's attention to him. His courteous good nature seemed never to fail him. His seminars and proseminars usually met in his office, located next to Child Memorial Library, which houses the special collection of the Department of English and American Language and Literature located in Widener Library of Harvard University. The office, every surface covered with books and manuscripts, was a testament to Evans's scholarship. Indeed, even in old age Evans continued his habits as a scholar, stalking the corridors and stacks of Widener Library, steadily working. Evans died on December 23, 2005, aged 93. Legacy Evans's last book was The Poems of Robert Parry, a study of the little-known poet Robert Parry.

It had a long -week life from 6 March to 24 March 1997. Peaking as a Category 3 cyclone and making landfall as a Category 2, it caused significant damage in the Cairns region, which it approached on two occasions. Houses were undermined by huge waves, a marina and boats were severely damaged, roads and bridges suffered from flood and landslide damage and huge losses were inflicted on sugar cane, fruit and vegetable crops. The death toll in Queensland was seven including five on a yacht which sank. There were 26 who died in Papua New Guinea, which was also severely affected. Total estimated costs from damages in Australia were $190 million (1997 values). Meteorological history On 3 March 1997 the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) observed multiple areas of low pressure across the Coral Sea. Over the next couple of days, these low pressure systems organized and consolidated, and on 7 March local time the cyclone was named Justin. Justin slowly strengthened and increased in size for a few days after its formation, reaching 10-minute sustained wind speeds of on 9 March. On that day, strong winds resulted in extensive damage and loss of life occurred in parts of Papua New Guinea, as well as downed trees and severe beach erosion in central Queensland. Over the subsequent four days, the storm moved very slowly to the north, weakening as it went due to cooler sea surface temperatures and increasing vertical wind shear. During this time it passed near Willis Island, dropping record rainfall of more than on the island. On 13 March, the storm reached warmer waters and began to re-intensify as it continued to drift slowly to the northeast. Justin curved back towards the south on 16 March, and began to rapidly intensify. On 17 March, it reached peak intensity with sustained winds of . Strong winds again began to affect Papua New Guinea, causing widespread damage and leaving around 12,000 people homeless. On 19 March, the storm again began to weaken due to wind shear and passing over its previous path with cool water temperatures, and by 20 March the storm had sustained winds of only . However, yet again the storm reached warm waters and lesser wind shear, and began intensifying again as it approached the coast of Queensland. On 22 March, Justin made landfall north of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. Despite being over land, Justin maintained deep atmospheric convection as it moved southeast towards Townsville. However, wind shear again increased, causing the storm to rapidly weaken, dissipating entirely early on 24 March just off the coast of Queensland. Impact Severe Tropical Cyclone Justin caused 37 deaths and had a significant impact on the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Queensland, Australia. As a result, the name Justin was retired because of the impact of this system. Papua New Guinea Being a long-lived storm with a wandering motion, Justin produced major winds across Papua New Guinea that caused major damage on two occasions, once around 10 March and again around 17 March. Around 30 people were killed in the country, with another 12,000 left homeless. Solomon Islands Cyclone Justin affected the Solomon Islands between March 15‚Äì19, with heavy rain causing landslides and extensive damage to the Solomon Islands. Queensland =Economic= Cyclone Justin left a devastating path of destruction that had a major economic impact. Its storm force winds, which reached up to 150 km/h, caused extensive damage to banana, sugar cane and pawpaw crops. This resulted in an overall loss of $150million to the Queensland Horticulture and Sugar Cane Industry, as these crops could no longer be exported or sold. This also resulted in expensive prices of Bananas and Pawpaws all over the country as there was a great demand for them but not enough products. Cyclone Justin's storm force winds also caused severe damage to power lines, which resulted in the power being out for 36 hours. Consequently, many businesses could not operate and some businesses lost perishable goods due to their fridges and freezers being unable to prevent food from going off. All of this resulted in a loss of income. Unemployment was also a major consequence of Cyclone Justin's destruction. The destruction of crops eliminated the need for truck drivers to transport the goods and harvesters to harvest the crops. Other jobs were also affected such as those in tourism, as holiday-makers avoided the area until the wreckages had been cleaned up. On the other hand, the building industry and manufacturers flourished as the need to repair to replace goods/buildings, which had been destroyed or damaged by Cyclone Justin, was tremendously high. With damage to many buildings, vehicles, produce and other items, thousands of insurances claims were made. Some insurance premiums then rose so that the companies could cover the cost of the claims. =Human= The cyclone resulted in 7 fatalities; 5 people were on a yacht that sank, a woman was killed in a landslide which was triggered by the excessive rainfall, and a boy was electrocuted by a falling power line. The areas affected were very close knit communities, and so, when these fatalities occurred everybody was devastated. This resulted in the communities being brought together by their shared experiences and underlying grief. Many of the other social impacts of Cyclone Justin go hand in hand with the economic ones. For instance, some farmers' only source of income is their crops, so when their crops were destroyed they did not have anything left. This would have been a very stressful time, as they would have to find another way to make money in order to rebuild their properties/crops. This could have induced mental anguish on some of the farmers and resulted in them giving up on farming and moving away altogether. A similar situation would be felt by those who were rendered unemployed by the cyclone, as they would not have an income stream to support themselves on. =Environmental= The environmental impact of Cyclone Justin was large and varied. The Great Barrier Reef was one of the most significant locations which were damaged by the cyclone. With a limited width of open water, the Barrier Reef is, as its name suggests, a barrier to the land against high swells. Although this means that the land is relatively well protected, the reef is exposed to high swells and large waves. When Cyclone Justin hit some parts, mainly around Heron Island and the Whitsundays, of the Great Barrier Reef's ecosystem were severely damaged. This is because Justin's extreme wave power caused the break-up of corals which many fish and other organisms relied on to live; in turn, this affected the larger organisms which relied on these smaller organisms to live, and so on. Some experts believe, however, that the break-up of hard corals is a positive impact as it is simply part of the reef's life cycle. Cyclone Justin also impacted the beaches along Northern Queensland. Many beaches experienced acute erosion due to high tides and storm surge. As well as this saltwater inundated many areas, specifically from Cooktown to Fraser Island. Many plants have an extremely low tolerance to saltwater and for that reason, a significant amount of vegetation along the coast died.

It was broadcast in the United States on September 1, 2008http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings.aspx?id=20080818fox01 and on the next day on Sky One and RT√â Two. Plot Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) has tracked Gretchen Morgan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and James Whistler (Chris Vance) to Los Angeles. The pair are negotiating for \\"Scylla\\", a card/disc of important Company data, and Whistler kills its current owner rather than pay for it. Before he and Gretchen can finish their operation, Michael arrives, planning to kill them as revenge for the death of Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies). Gretchen claims that Sara is alive, but before she can say anything else, the police arrive in response to a murder committed by Whistler. Unbeknownst to Gretchen, Whistler has copied the Card, keeping the original for himself, and giving the copy to a Company representative on the way out. When the General (Leon Russom) discovers this, he orders Wyatt (Cress Williams), a Company assassin, to have Gretchen killed. Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) is still in Panama with Sofia Lugo (Danay Garcia) and L.J. Burrows (Marshall Allman) when Michael calls him. They discuss the recent events in Sona: the prisoners rioted, burning the place down and allowing Theodore \\"T-Bag\\" Bagwell (Robert Knepper), Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) and Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) to escape. Michael also asks about how sure Lincoln is that Sara is dead. After the conversation, Michael is contacted by Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) and Whistler, who are secretly working with Homeland Security to destroy the Company. Key to this plan is the Card, codenamed \\"Scylla\\", which contains information on all the Company's agents and operations, but can only be decoded from within an unknown facility. Whistler again hints that Sara is still alive when Wyatt arrives and attacks them, killing Whistler and retrieving the original copy of Scylla. To learn the truth, Michael travels to Chicago and contacts Sara's friend Bruce Bennett (Wilbur Fitzgerald) to find out for sure whether Sara is still alive, but gets caught by the police. Meanwhile, Lincoln, Sofia and L.J. are attacked by a Company agent. Lincoln kills the assassin in a fight, and gets arrested by the Panamanian police. Mahone returns to the home of his family only to discover that there is a police fence outside Pam's home. Fearing that something may have happened to Pam and Cameron, he quickly steps out of the car and runs towards the house, but the police officer stop him and tells him \\"that you don't want to go in there\\". Since he is still wanted in the United States, Mahone is immediately arrested as well. Michael and Lincoln are reunited in custody by Agent Don Self (Michael Rapaport). Self is the Homeland Security agent who was working not only with Whistler, but with Aldo Burrows (Anthony Denison), in order to take down the Company. Unable to trust people within the government, Self arranges to have Michael and Lincoln be part of an unofficial, off-the-books operation to recover Scylla from the Company, with their freedom guaranteed when it's all over. The brothers refuse the offer. Bruce pays their bail, and when they're released, he reunites Michael with Sara, who has been hiding out from the Company in Chicago after being tortured by Gretchen. When Wyatt attacks the group at their supposedly secret hideout, Michael, Lincoln and Sara decide to join Self's team, believing that they can only be safe once the Company is destroyed. Also drafted into the team is Mahone, Bellick and Sucre - who were captured while trying to visit Sucre's baby girl. In a subplot, T-Bag is making his way from Panama to the United States, looking for Michael in order to get his revenge. He tries to get to San Diego, following direction written in Whistler's bird book (which, unbeknownst to him, contains information on where to decode Scylla), but his drivers steal T-Bag's money and abandon him in the desert with their overweight companion.  Reception  The premier received from the IGN readers \\"Last Week's Best Episode\\" award. IGN said though that this was because \\"the show didn't have a whole lot of competition this week\\".

Because of the rugged terrain, the road is often closed due to heavy rain, typhoons, or landslides, leading to injuries and deaths.

The Reservation is currently being managed with the assistance from the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). The fossil and plant resources on the adjacent Holyoke Gas and Electric (HG&E;) riverfront property are being managed cooperatively by The Trustees, Mass DCR, and HG&E.; the footprints in a row, as the dinosaurs walked The dinosaur tracks at this site were among the first to be scientifically described in 1836, and are still visible to visitors. Hundreds of tracks, which were made by as many as four distinct types of two-legged dinosaur, are present in the sandstone outcrops. Additional fossils that have been found at the site or nearby include invertebrate burrows, fish, and plants (including charcoalified logs and leaves). The parallel orientation of many of the dinosaur trackways was among the first lines of evidence used to support the novel theory that dinosaurs traveled in packs or groups. Fossils As the name implies, fossil footprints are this park's main attraction. They were formed during the Early Jurassic period (approximately 200 million years ago) when what is now the Connecticut River Valley was a subtropical region filled with lakes and swamps. Bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs up to long left footprints on the ancient mudflats. The area was acclaimed by 19th century paleontologists for its abundance of fossil specimens, dinosaur tracks in particular, and the reservation is popular with the ichnologists who study them. This area was first studied by Edward Hitchcock, the Amherst College professor who advanced the revolutionary notion that rather than being cold-blooded reptiles, dinosaurs were more like a sort of \\"reptilian bird.\\" In the 1930s, a Springfield, Massachusetts newspaper poked fun at this notion by referring to the animals that left the fossilized footprints as \\"the Giant Turkeys of Prof. Hitchcock.\\"Mount Holyoke College: Lost Dinosaur In the last two centuries the site has drawn the attention of numerous palaeontologists, including Thomas Henry Huxley, who visited the site during his trip to America in August of 1876. The late John Ostrom of Yale University mapped the site and reported finding 134 tracks preserved in the sandstone beds in a seminal paper he wrote on dinosaur gregariousness. Ostrom attributed the tracks to small, medium, and large theropod dinosaurs, and assigned the tracks to the ichnospecies Grallator cuneatus, which are to long, Anchisauripus sillimani, and Eubrontes giganteus, which are to long. The parallel orientation of the Eubrontes giganteus trackways and the supposed lack of a physical barrier led Ostrom to the conclusion that the large animals were gregarious and traveled in a \\"herd, pack, or flock.\\" The latest mapping project, conducted by Patrick Getty and Aaron Judge, has shown that there are at least 787 dinosaur tracks at the site and that the Eubrontes giganteus trackways are in fact parallel, or nearly parallel, to the orientation of oscillation wave-formed ripples. Considering that oscillation ripples form parallel to the shoreline, these authors suggested that the parallel trackways represent shoreline-paralleling behavior in large carnivores rather than group behavior. The hypothesis that the parallel trackways were made by shoreline-paralleling behavior is further supported by the fact that parallelism is not seen in Eubrontes giganteus trackways preserved at other sites in the Connecticut River Valley. In addition to the footprints of theropod dinosaurs, those of early ornithischians, called Anomoepus scambus (some with associated tail drags), have been identified at Dinosaur Footprint Reservation. Non-dinosaurs are represented by footprints called Batrachopus, which were made by basal crocodilians. Smith College professor William J.

In a way, it is a miniature version of Zamma; however, there are more diagonal lines per square on the board as compared to Zamma. The game is considered part of the Zamma family. The game is also similar to Alquerque and draughts. The board is essentially an Alquerque board with twice the number of diagonal lines or segments allowing for greater freedom of movement. The initial setup is also similar to Alquerque, where every space on the board is filled with each player's pieces except for the middle point of the board. Moreover, each player's pieces are also set up on each player's half of the board. The game specifically resembles draughts in that pieces must move in the forward directions until they are crowned \\"Mullah\\" (or \\"Sultan\\") which is the equivalent of the King in draughts. The Mullah can move in any direction. It is unknown how old the game is; however, the idea that pieces must move forward until they are crowned Mullah is a feature thought to have been developed and borrowed from draughts which came into being only in the 17th century. This is, however, open to debate. Two similar games are played by the Hopi native American Indians of Arizona, US, which may suggest a historical connection with Kharbaga, and Alquerque in general. One of the Hopi games is called tukvnanawopi. The board pattern, the number of pieces, and the initial setup are the same as in Kharbaga's. The only differences, and they are significant, is that in tukvnanawopi pieces can move in any direction at any time during the game (there is no need for promotion to Mullah or King as in Kharbaga), and also when a row of squares on one end of the board becomes empty during the game, pieces can no longer be played in that row of squares. As the game progresses, more rows of squares become empty and unplayable, and the playing board continues to shrink. The other Hopi game which is also played throughout Mexico is called tuknanavuhpi. In this case, when a row of points on one end of the board becomes empty, it is no longer playable, and again the playing board shrinks as the game progresses. Lastly, another native American Indian tribe called the Keres of New Mexico, US plays a game most similar to Kharbaga. The only difference is that pieces can move in any direction at any time during the game and each player has 22 pieces. It is uncertain how the game can be played this way since both players would yield 44 pieces total and there are only 41 intersection points that make up the board. The game is called Aiyawatstani or \\"chuck away grains\\".  Goal  The player who captures all their opponent's pieces is the winner.  Equipment  The board is a 5√ó5 square grid, or a 4√ó4 square board with pieces played on the intersections with left and right diagonal lines running through each square of the board. Each player has 20 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other player plays the white pieces.  Gameplay and rules  #Player decide which colors to play, and who starts first. #The board is filled in the beginning with all the players pieces. The only point vacant on the board is the middle point. Each player's pieces are placed on their half of the board, and lined up on the right-hand side of the 5th. rank (the middle horizontal line of the grid board). #Players alternate their turns. A non-Mullah piece moves forward only (straight forward or diagonally forward) one space per turn following the pattern on the board until they are crowned Mullah by reaching the last rank. Only one piece may be moved or used to capture enemy piece(s) per turn. #A non-Mullah piece may capture an enemy piece by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerqe. The capture can be in any direction. Multiple captures are allowed, however, the line with the most captures must be taken. Captures are compulsory for non-Mullah and Mullah pieces. #When a piece reaches the other player's rank, it is promoted to Mullah. The Mullah can move and capture in any direction. It can also move any number of spaces as in the King in international draughts. The Mullah can also capture an enemy piece from any distance, and land anywhere behind the captured piece provided there are no other pieces (friendly or not) within the spaces of the leap. If playing a variant where enemy pieces are not removed immediately when captured, the Mullah can not go back to any of them and leap them again. However, in a variant where captured pieces are removed immediately, the Mullah can leap over them again in order to leap another enemy piece(s). #If a non-Mullah piece reaches the other player's rank as an intermediate step of a capturing sequence, the piece does not get promoted to Mullah.

In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings are determined by the configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to the point at which the worm currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown. The worms were studied in the early 1970s by Paterson, Conway and Michael Beeler, described by Beeler in June 1973, and presented in November 1973 in Martin Gardner's \\"Mathematical Games\\" column in Scientific American. Electronic Arts' 1983 game Worms? is an interactive implementation of Paterson's worms, where each time a worm has to turn in a way that it lacks a rule for, it stops and lets the user choose a direction, which sets that rule for that worm. History Fossilized worm tracks. Paterson's worms are an attempt to simulate the behaviour of prehistoric worms. These creatures fed upon sediment at the bottom of ponds and avoided retracing paths they had already travelled because food would be scarce there but, because food occurred in patches, it was in the worm's interest to stay near previous trails. Different species of worm had different innate rules regarding how close to travelled paths to stay, when to turn, and how sharp a turn to make. In 1969 Raup and Seilacher created computer simulations of the fossilized worm trails, and these simulations inspired Paterson and Conway to develop a simple set of rules to study idealized worms on regular grids. Conway's original model was a worm on an orthogonal grid but this produced only three different species of worm, all with rather uninteresting behaviour. Paterson considered worms on a triangular grid. Paterson's worms were described by Beeler in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology AI Memo (#) and were presented in November 1973 in Martin Gardner's \\"Mathematical Games\\" column in Scientific American, and later reprinted in . These simulations differed in approach from other cellular automata developed around the same time, which focused on cells and the relationships between them. Simple computer models such as these are too abstract to accurately describe the behaviour of the real creatures, but they do demonstrate that even very simple rules can give rise to patterns resembling their tracks. Rules The worm starts at some point of an infinite triangular grid. It starts moving along one of the six gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point. The worm then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it will take. The directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must move in the same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends. Discussion There are many different types of worm depending on which direction they turn when encountering a new type of intersection. The different varieties of worm can be classified systematically by assigning every direction a number and listing the choice made every time a new type of intersection is encountered. The six directions are numbered as follows: :File:PatersonWormDirections.png So direction 0 indicates the worm continues to travel straight ahead, direction 1 indicates the worm will make a right turn of 60¬∞ and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in direction 3 because that is the gridline it has just traversed. Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first time it has to make a choice, in direction 0 the next time it has to make a choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, the worm has no choice but to take it and this is usually not explicitly listed. Paterson's worm with rule { 2, 0, 0 } A worm whose ruleset begins with 0 continues in a straight line forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm. There are 1,296 possible combinations of worm rules. This can be seen by the following argument: # If the worm encounters a node with no eaten segments, other than the one it has just eaten, it can either make a sharp turn or a gentle one. This is the situation shown in the figure above. Since the initial choice of left or right produce combinations that simply mirrors of each other, they are not effectively different. # If it encounters a node with one eaten segment, it can leave along any of the remaining four. Only the worm's first return to the origin has this character. # For two eaten segments, the location of the eaten segments is important. The only type of two-segment intersections that can exist is that produced by the first rule, for which there are four distinct approach directions, each of which offers a choice of three departure directions. This allows for 81 different alternatives in choosing rules. # If the worm returns to the origin, it will encounter three eaten segments and must choose between the two remaining uneaten ones regardless of their distribution. # For four eaten segments, there is only one uneaten segment left and the worm must take it. There are therefore 2√ó4√ó81√ó2x1=1,296 different combinations of rules. Many of these are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having to make all the choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 distinct species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion (5.7√ó1013) timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.2√ó1019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments. It is possible for two different species of worm to produce the same path, though they do not necessarily traverse it in the same order. The most common path is also the shortest: the seven point \\"radioactivity symbol\\". One example of this path is shown in the animated figure above. In total there are 299 different paths, and 209 of these are produced by just one species.

He is a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Background Charles Chukwuemeka Ugwuh was born on 3 December 1942 in the Obowo Local Government Area of the Okigwe zone of Imo State. Charles Ugwuh holds an MSc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Birmingham, England. He is the owner of Rokana Industries and Hydro Resources Industries Limited, both located in Imo State. Charles Ugwuh became president of Manufacturers' Association of Nigeria (MAN). Speaking in 2003, he said that Nigerian companies were willing to go into joint ventures with foreign partners. He was concerned that Nigeria should manufacture goods, rather than import them, and that investors should put money into industries other than oil. He saw the government's role as providing incentives for investors and supplying basic infrastructure such as health, education, social security, and new roads. Political career In late 2006, while still president on MAN, Ugwuh competed in the PDP primaries to select their candidate for Imo State governor in the April 2007 elections. Senator Ifeanyi Godwin Araraume was the clear winner, with Ugwuh in tenth place. Apparently due to pressure from President Olusegun Obasanjo, the PDP declared that Ugwuh was their candidate. Araraume contested this decision, and his candidacy was upheld by the Independent National Electoral Commission, despite the fact that the PDP expelled Araraume from the party. The PDP gave their support to Chief Martin Agbaso of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). Araruame was defeated by Ikedi Ohakim of the Progressive Peoples Alliance. Ugwuh emerged winner of Imo State Chairmanship election on 1st of August 2020. He is presently the Chairman of Imo State Chapter PDP. Minister of Commerce and Industry President Umaru Yar'Adua named Charles Ugwuh Minister for Commerce & Industry on 27 July 2007. In September 2007, Charles Ugwuh headed a Nigerian delegation to China for a \\"Nigeria-China Business and Investment Forum\\". He noted the expanding investment from China, and expressed hopes that both sides will continue to push economic and trade co-operation to a new level. In a January 2008 interview, Ugwuh outlined the new government strategy for manufacturing, based on the clustering concept ‚Äì industrial parks, industrial clusters, enterprise zones, incubators and then free trade zones. In March 2008, Charles Ugwuh allowed a limited number of licences for cement importation, trying to balance the need to protect the local cement industry while meeting unfilled demand. In April 2008, he announced plans to revive the automobile industry, with focus on light vans, trucks and buses. In May 2008 Charles Ugwuh noted that the food crisis, which started with a steep rise in the price of wheat, had spread to other parts of the world. To prevent shortage, the Federal Government would release grain from strategic reserves as needed.

The discipline is concerned with the characterization of polymeric materials on a variety of levels. The characterization typically has as a goal to improve the performance of the material. As such, many characterization techniques should ideally be linked to the desirable properties of the material such as strength, impermeability, thermal stability, and optical properties.http://camcor.uoregon.edu/labs/polymer-character. Chartoff, Richard.\\"Polymer Characterization Laboratory\\". University of Oregon CAMCOR. 2013. Characterization techniques are typically used to determine molecular mass, molecular structure, morphology, thermal properties, and mechanical properties.Campbell, D.; Pethrick, R. A.; White, J. R. Polymer Characterization Physical Techniques. Chapman and Hall, 1989 p. 11-13. Molecular mass The molecular mass of a polymer differs from typical molecules, in that polymerization reactions produce a distribution of molecular weights and shapes. The distribution of molecular masses can be summarized by the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. Some of the most common methods for determining these parameters are colligative property measurements, static light scattering techniques, viscometry, and size exclusion chromatography. Gel permeation chromatography, a type of size exclusion chromatography, is an especially useful technique used to directly determine the molecular weight distribution parameters based on the polymer's hydrodynamic volume. Gel permeation chromatography is often used in combination with multi-angle light scattering (MALS), Low-angle laser light scattering (LALLS) and/or viscometry for an absolute determination (i.e., independent of the chromatographic separation details) of the molecular weight distribution as well as the branching ratio and degree of long chain branching of a polymer, provided a suitable solvent can be found.S. Podzimek. The use of GPC coupled with a multiangle laser light scattering photometer for the characterization of polymers. On the determination of molecular weight, size, and branching. J. Appl. Polymer Sci. 1994 54 , 91-103. Molar mass determination of copolymers is a much more complicated procedure. The complications arise from the effect of solvent on the homopolymers and how this can affect the copolymer morphology. Analysis of copolymers typically requires multiple characterization methods. For instance, copolymers with short chain branching such as linear low-density polyethylene (a copolymer of ethylene and a higher alkene such as hexene or octene) require the use of Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation (ATREF) techniques. These techniques can reveal how the short chain branches are distributed over the various molecular weights. A more efficient analysis of copolymer molecular mass and composition is possible using GPC combined with a triple-detection system comprising multi-angle light scattering, UV absorption and differential refractometry, if the copolymer is composed of two base polymers that provide different responses to UV and/or refractive index. Molecular structure Many of the analytical techniques used to determine the molecular structure of unknown organic compounds are also used in polymer characterization. Spectroscopic techniques such as ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and mass spectrometry are used to identify common functional groups. Morphology Polymer morphology is a microscale property that is largely dictated by the amorphous or crystalline portions of the polymer chains and their influence on each other. Microscopy techniques are especially useful in determining these microscale properties, as the domains created by the polymer morphology are large enough to be viewed using modern microscopy instruments. Some of the most common microscopy techniques used are X-ray diffraction, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Atomic Force Microscopy. Polymer morphology on a mesoscale (nanometers to micrometers) is particularly important for the mechanical properties of many materials. Transmission Electron Microscopy in combination with staining techniques, but also Scanning Electron Microscopy, Scanning probe microscopy are important tools to optimize the morphology of materials like polybutadiene-polystyrene polymers and many polymer blends. X-ray diffraction is generally not as powerful for this class of materials as they are either amorphous or poorly crystallized. The Small- angle scattering like Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can be used to measure the long periods of semicrystalline polymers. Thermal properties A true workhorse for polymer characterization is thermal analysis, particularly Differential scanning calorimetry. Changes in the compositional and structural parameters of the material usually affect its melting transitions or glass transitions and these in turn can be linked to many performance parameters. For semicrystalline polymers it is an important method to measure crystallinity. Thermogravimetric analysis can also give an indication of polymer thermal stability and the effects of additives such as flame retardants. Other thermal analysis techniques are typically combinations of the basic techniques and include differential thermal analysis, thermomechanical analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and dielectric thermal analysis. Dynamic mechanical spectroscopy and dielectric spectroscopy are essentially extensions of thermal analysis that can reveal more subtle transitions with temperature as they affect the complex modulus or the dielectric function of the material. Mechanical properties The characterization of mechanical properties in polymers typically refers to a measure of the strength, elasticity, viscoelasticity, and anisotropy of a polymeric material. The mechanical properties of a polymer are strongly dependent upon the Van der Waals interactions of the polymer chains, and the ability of the chains to elongate and align in the direction of the applied force. Other phenomena, such as the propensity of polymers to form crazes can impact the mechanical properties. Typically, polymeric materials are characterized as elastomers, plastics, or rigid polymers depending on their mechanical properties. The tensile strength, yield strength, and Young's modulus are measures of strength and elasticity, and are of particular interest for describing the stress-strain properties of polymeric materials. These properties can be measured through tensile testing. For crystalline or semicrystalline polymers, anisotropy plays a large role in the mechanical properties of the polymer. The crystallinity of the polymer can be measured through differential scanning calorimetry. For amorphous and semicrystalline polymers, as stress is applied, the polymer chains are able to disentangle and align. If the stress is applied in the direction of chain alignment, the polymer chains will exhibit a higher yield stress and strength, as the covalent bonds connecting the backbone of the polymer absorb the stress. However, if the stress is applied normal to the direction of chain alignment, the Van der Waals interactions between chains will primarily be responsible for the mechanical properties and thus, the yield stress will decrease. This would be observable in a stress strain graph found through tensile testing. Sample preparation, including chain orientation within the sample, for tensile tests therefore can play a large role in the observed mechanical properties. The fracture properties of crystalline and semicrystalline polymers can be evaluated with Charpy impact testing. Charpy tests, which can also be used with alloy systems, are performed by creating a notch in the sample, and then using a pendulum to fracture the sample at the notch. The pendulum‚Äôs motion can be used to extrapolate the energy absorbed by the sample to fracture it. Charpy tests can also be used to evaluate the strain rate on the fracture, as measured with changes in the pendulum mass. Typically, only brittle and somewhat ductile polymers are evaluated with Charpy tests. In addition to the fracture energy, the type of break can be visually evaluated, as in whether the break was a total fracture of the sample or whether the sample experienced fracture in only part of the sample, and severely deformed section are still connected. Elastomers are typically not evaluated with Charpy tests due to their high yield strain inhibiting the Charpy test results. There are many properties of polymeric materials that influence their mechanical properties. As the degree of polymerization goes up, so does the polymer‚Äôs strength, as a longer chains have high Van der Waals interactions and chain entanglement. Long polymers can entangle, which leads to a subsequent increase in bulk modulus. Crazes are small cracks that form in a polymer matrix, but which are stopped by small defects in the polymer matrix. These defects are typically made up of a second, low modulus polymer that is dispersed throughout the primary phase. The crazes can increase the strength and decrease the brittleness of a polymer by allowing the small cracks to absorb higher stress and strain without leading to fracture. If crazes are allowed to propagate or coalesce, they can lead to cavitation and fracture in the sample. Crazes can be seen with transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and are typically engineered into a polymeric material during synthesis. Crosslinking, typically seen in thermoset polymers, can also increase the modulus, yield stress, and yield strength of a polymer. Dynamic mechanical analysis is the most common technique used to characterize viscoelastic behavior common in many polymeric systems. DMA is also another important tool to understand the temperature dependence of polymers‚Äô mechanical behavior. Dynamic mechanical analysis is a characterization technique used to measure storage modulus and glass transition temperature, confirm crosslinking, determine switching temperatures in shape-memory polymers, monitor cures in thermosets, and determine molecular weight. An oscillating force is applied to a polymer sample and the sample‚Äôs response is recorded. DMA documents the lag between force applied and deformation recovery in the sample. Viscoelastic samples exhibit a sinusoidal modulus called the dynamic modulus. Both energy recovered and lost are considered during each deformation and described quantitatively by the elastic modulus (E‚Äô) and the loss modulus (E‚Äô‚Äô) respectively. The applied stress and the strain on the sample exhibit a phase difference, ·∫ü, which is measured over time. A new modulus is calculated each time stress is applied to the material, so DMA is used to study changes in modulus at various temperatures or stress frequencies. Other techniques include viscometry, rheometry, and pendulum hardness.

Early career  Sandra Stevens first entered into a singing career at the age of sixteen when she joined the club band, The Track (who then changed their name to The Nocturnes). The group was formed by drummer Ross Mitchell and among the six members Stevens sang vocals alongside Eve Graham (later of The New Seekers). Based in Manchester, the band played local clubs, performing pop hits of the day such as \\"The Loco- Motion\\" and \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\". In early 1967 Stevens decided to leave the group and was replaced by Lyn Paul (also later of The New Seekers). Over the next few years she sang with the big bands of Joe Loss and Ken MacKintosh and also joined another group, Jason Flocks. Also at this time Stevens was working during the day as a shorthand typist.  Brotherhood of Man  In 1973, Stevens was performing as the resident singer at the Wakefield Theatre when she came to the attention of Tony Hiller who was looking to recruit a new singer for Brotherhood of Man ‚Äì a group he was managing. The group were currently performing as a trio (Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden and Nicky Stevens (no relation)) and had released two singles. Stevens took the two singles and listened to them, immediately she was taken by the sound and was keen to join them. In late 1973 Brotherhood of Man became a four-piece with Sandra sharing lead vocals. It wasn't long before the group released their first single featuring the new line up. In January 1974 \\"When Love Catches Up on You\\" was released on Dawn Records and by the end of the year they had scored a European hit with \\"Lady\\" and had released an album. Over the next few years, Stevens enjoyed great success with Brotherhood of Man throughout the world. In 1975 they scored their first number one single and a year later they won the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Save Your Kisses for Me\\".The Eurovision Song Contest ‚Äì The Official History. O'Connor, John Kennedy. Carlton Books 2007 The song made No.1 in the UK as well as many other countries and this was followed by two more UK chart toppers, \\"Angelo\\" and \\"Figaro\\". Although Hiller, Sheriden and Lee wrote the bulk of their material, Stevens is credited as a co-writer on one of their songs: \\"Let's Love Together\\", the B-Side to \\"Save Your Kisses for Me\\". In over 100 songs recorded, this is the only time that one of the female members of the group received a writing credit. Stevens continued with Brotherhood of Man, recording lead vocals for many of their biggest hits and performing live with them through the decades. The group is still together and active today, still with the same line-up. They continue to appear in concert and on television.  Personal life  During the peak of the group's success, Stevens was in a relationship with fellow band member Martin Lee and moved in with him. Due to the young age of many of the group's fans, this was kept largely a secret. In August 1979 they married and are still together today. They have no children and live in Surrey.

The firm merged with Dentons, a large multi-national law firm, in June 2015. History McKenna Long & Aldridge was formed by the 2002 merger of two firms --the Washington, DC-based McKenna & Cuneo and the Atlanta-based Long Aldridge & Norman. The firm that would become McKenna & Cuneo was founded in 1939 by Franklin D. Roosevelt's former attorney general, Homer Stille Cummings. In a December 1999 profile of McKenna & Cuneo, the Legal Times noted that early lawyers at the firm, Gilbert Cuneo and Albert Reeves Jr., helped create the nation's first government contracts practice. The firm that would become Long Aldridge & Norman was founded in 1974 by Clay Long, John Aldridge and Bill Stevens. The firm focused on corporate and business law through its Atlanta and Washington, DC offices. In 2012, MLA and San Diego-based law firm Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps LLP combined practices. Luce Forward, founded in 1873 by Moses A. Luce, was the first law firm founded in what would become San Diego, California, and was the firm responsible for drafting the charter that established the city. The merged firms operate under the name McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP. In April 2015, it was agreed that the firm would merge with the law firm Dentons. The merger was completed in June 2015. Noteworthy cases * The firm represented the government of Canada in connection with the record- breaking reorganizations of Chrysler and General Motors (GM). The firm served as lead counsel in both transactions for the government of Canada. The firm advised the government of Canada on the court-supervised sale of Chrysler that resulted in an alliance with Italian car maker Fiat. As part of the transaction, the Canadian government along with the province of Ontario provided a $3.775 billion loan, which enabled Canada to maintain its 20 percent production share in the North American market and protect nearly one million Canadian jobs. In connection with the court-supervised sale of a majority interest in GM to the equity owned largely by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Canadian government along with the province of Ontario provided a $9.5 billion loan to the new GM--an amount proportional to the $50 billion package provided by the U.S. government. * The firm's assisted the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation in what is believed to be the first contested union election conducted under a tribal labor statute. The tribe owns and operates Foxwoods Resort Casino and hired the firm when the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) sought to unionize Foxwoods' bartenders and beverage servicers. The firm began representing the tribe and Foxwoods in late 2007 after the National Labor Relations Board asserted jurisdiction over the tribe, which allowed the United Auto Workers to use federal law to successfully unionize Foxwoods' table games dealers. To avoid the same fate and, more importantly, to preserve tribal sovereignty, the team persuaded the UFCW to hold an election using the Mashantucket Pequot Labor Relations Law instead of the National Labor Relations Act. * In January 2009, MLA closed a $142 million project finance deal for Balfour Beatty Communities to design, build, develop, renovate and manage privatized family housing at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.

He co-founded Cineplex with Garth Drabinsky. Biography Taylor was born and raised in a Jewish family in Toronto, Ontario and began his business career in 1918 selling postcards.http://www.torontohistory.org/Pages_MNO/Nathan_Taylor.html He had 4 siblings: Fanny, Maish, Ida and Sylvia.Globe & Mail: \\"NATHAN A. (NAT) TAYLOR\\" March 3, 2004 At the age of 17, he was employed as local theatre manager while also earning a law degree from Osgoode Hall. In 1934, he went into business for himself and founded 20th Century (Twinex) Theatres; by 1941, Twinex operated 17 theatres. He was then hired by Famous Players Canadian Corporation to operate an additional 25 theatres in addition to his own in order to keep him from linking up with their Canadian competition, Odeon. As head of Twentieth Century Theatres, the Ontario branch of Famous Players Canadian Corporation, he built one of the world's first cineplex movie theatres in Ottawa, Ontario at the Elgin Theatre. The Elgin's second screen opened in December 1947 on a patch of land adjacent to the original 1935 theatre. At first, the same program played in both auditoriums, but several years later Taylor came up with the idea of selling tickets to different movies from the same box office, laying claim as the first to do so. He also created one of the first movie theatres in a shopping mall (the dual-screen at Yorkdale Plaza in Toronto, Ontario, opened in 1964) and one of the first in an office building (another dual-screen, opened in 1962 in Place Ville Marie in Montreal, Quebec). By the 1970s, Taylor had entirely sold all but a few of his theatres to Famous Players, yet he started a new theatre chain from scratch, with Garth Drabinsky co-founding Cineplex Odeon cinemas. The first location in 1979 at the Toronto Eaton Centre had 18 screens (soon increased to 21), a Guinness World Record at the time. He started the Canadian Film Weekly in 1941, edited by Hye Bossin. The magazine quickly became the key film trade paper in Canada, supplemented in 1951 with a yearbook for the Canadian film industry, and taking over the competing Canadian Moving Picture Digest in 1956. Taylor also distributed films, and produced of one of Canada's first horror movies The Mask. He was given a special Genie Award in 1984 for Outstanding Contributions to the Canadian Film Industry. In 1982, he received an honorary degree from York University after donating a movie theatre in his name to the school. Personal life Taylor was married twice. His first wife, Yvonne, and son Michael, predeceased him. His second wife was Canadian arts figure Claire Drainie Taylor, with whom he had six stepchildren, Bronwyn, Kathryn, Michael, Jocelyn, Philip and David. He died from natural causes. Services were held at the Holy Blossom Temple in Toronto.

The Commission was chaired by Mary Boydell and the chief executive officer was John Bradley. The agency was responsible for setting water restriction policy and coordinating water infrastructure projects in the state. In South East Queensland, the Commission established a regional water grid known as the SEQ Water Grid and the Western Corridor Recycled Water Project. Together with new dams and desalination plants the Commission aimed to counter the worst effects of drought in Australia. As part of 50-year South East Queensland water strategy the QWC recommended that the Government of Queensland focus on recycled water projects, rather than desalination plants, because desalination plants are too energy intensive and recycled water provides supply regardless of changes in climate. On 1 January 2013, the Queensland Water Commission ceased operations. Policy-making functions of the Commission were assumed by the Queensland Department of Energy and Water Supply and its planning and regulatory functions became the responsibility of Seqwater.

Weekend View included local and national outlooks for the day as well as lifestyle segments. On November 10, 2013, Weekend View aired for the final time and was replaced by Weather Center Live. Program history Weekend View's initial launch date was planned for September 10, 2005, but its premiere was delayed two weeks due to the busy 2005 hurricane season. Initial plans for the program, then hosted by Dao Vu and meteorologists Bill Keneely, Kelly Cass and Stephanie Abrams included an accompanying primetime talk show to debut in the second quarter of 2006, though those plans never came to fruition.http://www.multichannel.com/article/80736-Weather_s_New_Views_.php In the fall of 2006, meteorologist Stephanie Abrams left the program to co-host Abrams & Bettes: Beyond the Forecast with Mike Bettes and was not replaced. Later, in September 2007, meteorologist Samantha Mohr joined The Weather Channel to replace Kelly Cass, who moved to PM Edition. This move proved to be short-lived, as Cass returned to the program in May 2008. In April 2008, Vu (only the second non-meteorologist to ever host a live weather program on the channel; the other being Liz Jarvis-Fabian, who worked for the channel from 1986 to 1989) left and was not replaced.

The picture depicts Leda, the mythological queen of Sparta, with the swan. Leda is a frontal portrait of Dal√≠'s wife, Gala, who is seated on a pedestal with a swan suspended behind and to her left. Different objects such as a book, a set square, two stepping stools and an egg float around the main figure. In the background on both sides, the rocks of Cap Norfeu (on the Costa Brava in Catalonia, between Roses and Cadaqu√©s) define the location of the image. The painting is exhibited in the Dal√≠ Theatre and Museum in Figueres. Mythological background Leda was admired by Zeus, who seduced her in the guise of a swan on her wedding night when she slept with her husband Tyndareus. This double consummation of her marriage resulted in two eggs, each of them hatching twins: from the first egg Castor and Pollux, and from the second Clytemnestra and Helen. Structure of the painting Leda Atomica is organized according to a rigid mathematical framework, following the \\"divine proportion\\". Leda and the swan are set in a pentagon inside which has been inserted a five-point star of which Dal√≠ made several sketches. The five points of the star symbolize the seeds of perfection: love, order, light (truth) willpower and word (action). The harmony of the framework was calculated by the artist following the recommendations of Romanian mathematician Matila Ghyka. Unlike his contemporaries who took the view that mathematics distracted from or interrupted artistic inspiration, Dal√≠ considered that any work of art, to be such, had to be based on composition and calculation. Ghyka's influence is clear in the mathematical formula of the golden ratio in the lower right of the image :\\\\varphi = \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} which Ghyka specifically cites to calculate the side of a regular pentagon.Elliott H. King - Dal√≠ Atomicus, or the Prodigious Adventure of the Lacemaker and the Rhinoceros - Society for Literature and Science Annual Meeting October 10‚Äì13, 2002, Pasadena, California Symbolism of the painting After the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Dal√≠ took his work in a new direction based on the principle that the modern age had to be assimilated into art if art was to be truly contemporary. Dal√≠ acknowledged the discontinuity of matter, incorporating a mysterious sense of levitation into his Leda Atomica. Just as one finds that at the atomic level particles do not physically touch, so here Dal√≠ suspends even the water above the shore‚Äîan element that would figure into many other later works. Every object in the painting is carefully painted to be motionless in space, even though nothing in the painting is connected. Leda looks as if she is trying to touch the back of the swan's head, but doesn't do it. Dal√≠ himself described the painting in the following way: > \\"Dal√≠ shows us the hierarchized libidinous emotion, suspended and as though > hanging in midair, in accordance with the modern 'nothing touches' theory of > intra-atomic physics. Leda does not touch the swan; Leda does not touch the > pedestal; the pedestal does not touch the base; the base does not touch the > sea; the sea does not touch the shore. . . .\\" In reference to the classical myth Dal√≠ identified himself with the immortal Pollux while his deceased older brother (also called Salvador) would represent Castor, the mortal of the twins. Another equivalence could be made regarding the other twins of the myth, Dal√≠'s sister Ana Mar√≠a being the mortal Clytemnestra, while Gala would represent divine Helen. Salvador Dal√≠ himself wrote: \\"I started to paint Leda At√≥mica which exalts Gala, the metaphysical goddess and succeeded to create the ‚Äòsuspended space‚Äô\\". Dal√≠'s Catholicism enables also other interpretations of the painting. The painting can be conceived as Dal√≠'s way of interpreting the Annunciation. The swan seems to whisper her future in her ear, possibly a reference to the legend that the conception of Jesus was achieved by the introduction of the breath of the Holy Ghost into the Virgin Mary's ear. Leda looks straight into the bird's eyes with an understanding expression of what is happening to her and what will happen in the future to her and to her unsure reality. Dal√≠'s transformation of Mary is the result of love as if he created his love to Gala, like God to Mary.Leda Atomica Bibliography * Jean-Louis Ferrier - Dal√≠, Leda atomica : anatomie d'un chef-d'oeuvre ‚Äì Gonthier, Paris, 1980 - References Paintings by Salvador Dal√≠ 1949 paintings Dali Books in art Water in art ","title":"Leda Atomica"},{"id":"18886764","text":"Chiricahua National Forest was established as the Chiricahua Forest Reserve in Cochise County, Arizona by the General Land Office on July 1, 1902 with .

A puy or pui was a society, often organised as a guild or confraternity, sometimes along religious (Catholic) lines, for the patronisation of music and poetry, typically through the holding of competitions. The term puy derives from the Latin podium, meaning \\"a place to stand\\", referring probably to a raised platform from which either the contests delivered their works or the judges listened to them.Elizabeth C. Teviotdale, \\"Puy\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online (accessed 16 August 2008). Adam de la Halle, who was associated with the Puy d'Arras, was the first to use the word to mean \\"a society holding literary competitions\\". There is some reason to believe that they may have their name from the Massif Central (a plateau in central France), where troubadour competitions are known from the period circa 1162-96\\\\. See also \\"Puy\\", The Oxford Companion to Music, Alison Latham, ed., Oxford Music Online (accessed 17 August 2008). Puys were established in many cities in northern and central France, the Low Countries, and even England during the High Middle Ages and the Renaissance, usually encouraging composition in the Old French language, but also in Latin and Occitan.Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, by Richard Wagner, may reflect a similar tradition to that of the puy in medieval Germany. The typical puy was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Membership was regulated by statutes to which those entering had to swear. These governed the election of executive positions within the puy and the benefits inhering in members. Members could be clerical or lay, male or female, noble or bourgeois, urban or rural. The earliest societies were organised around para-liturgical celebrations of the Marian feast days, but these evolved poetry competitions and eventually the competitions became the focus of the festivals. Music and sung performance were emphasised early on, but over the centuries the quality of the poetry came to dominate the members' concern and the puys of Normandy, especially popular from the fifteenth century on, were redefined in the seventeenth as literary academies. In this form they survived until the French Revolution. A poetical society known, in a generic fashion, as the Puy Sainta Maria (Puy-Sainte-Marie), seems to have held contests at Le-Puy-en-Velay (Podium Aniciense) in the Occitan language under the patronage of Alfonso II of Aragon (1162-96). Among the troubadours known to have competed was the Monge de Montaudon, who received a Eurasian sparrowhawk as a prize for one piece. He is said by his vida to have held the \\"suzerainty\\" of the \\"court of Puy\\" (cour du Puy) until it was dissolved.Margarita Egan, ed. (1984), The Vidas of the Troubadours (New York: Garland, ), 70. The height of the French puys was in the Late Middle Ages. The puy would have an open invitation for competitions in several categories, with the theme, form, and refrain in each category stipulated.At Amiens every year, the refrain was publicised on a scroll alongside the Virgin and some illustrious contemporaries on a painted panel in the cathedral. Copies of these paintings, along with the winning chants royaux, from the period 1460-1517 are preserved in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Paris, French MS 145, a work made for Louise of Savoy. Among the common most common forms were the formes fixes, the chant royal, jeu parti, serventois, and ballade. The music was generally strophic monophony, but the puy at √âvreux, founded in 1570, did accept two submissions of through-composed polyphony from Orlande de Lassus. The problems of adjudication at the contests spurned the production of several treatises on versification in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.Pierre Fabri wrote Le grant et vrai art de pleine rh√©torique (1521) for puy of Rouen. As in the Floral Games celebrated in southern France and Spain, the prizes awarded by the puys could be flowers, such as lilies or roses, or sometimes palms. These floral prizes could be redeemable for money. Besides these, the puys sometimes bestowed signet rings (engraved with imagery or poetry). The puys could attract professionals and men of fame, such as Jean Froissart, who competed and won at Abbeville, Lille, Tournai, and Valenciennes. They also attracted local amateurs.

It is one of two such schoolhouses remaining in Shutesbury, and is a rare example of a side-gable construction. Its date of construction is uncertain, but is estimated to be about 1830. Because of the simplicity of the building, the presence of both Federal and Greek Revival elements in its design, and the comparatively late adoption of Greek Revival styles in the rural community, the school may have been built at a later date. The schoolhouse sits about 15 feet off Schoolhouse Road and 50 feet from Baker Road, with its gable end facing the street. The 1.5 story building sits on a granite slab foundation, and has a chimney on its western wall. It measures about 25.5 feet by 18 feet, and there is a shed structure attached to the east wall. The main entrance is set in the right side of the south wall. The entry leads into a vestibule area, from which there is then entry into the schoolroom. There is a closet in the northeast corner, from which a hatch provides access to the attic area. The walls of the interior have a bead-board wainscoting, with horizontal tongue-and-groove boards rising to the ceiling. The classroom floor is wide pine, while that of the entry is narrow fir strips. From its construction until 1928 the building served as a school, and was known as the District 8 School or the Moses S. Bartlett School, after a nearby resident. Its use declined after 1881, when the town abolished its districts, but was occasionally used due to fluctuating enrollments. The district schools were permanently closed in 1928, and elementary classes were centralized. The town sold the school for $200 in 1939, and it was converted to residential use. In 1993 the property was given to the Sirius Community, a nearby spiritual and educational organization, which has since undertaken the building's rehabilitation. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

It rises from a large unnamed glacier in the Cariboo Mountains at an elevation of and flows southwest for to the head of gigantic Murtle Lake. The river also drains Murtle Lake then flows southwest for into the Clearwater River. The Murtle River is the longest and largest tributary to the Clearwater. The Murtle River is known for having many waterfalls along its course. Between Murtle Lake and the Clearwater River, the Murtle drops over seven named waterfalls: McDougall, Meadow, Horseshoe, Majerus, Dawson, The Mushbowl and Helmcken Falls.Waterfalls Northwest Discovery and naming There are no records about the Murtle River being known by First Nations. The river was discovered by Joseph Hunter, a surveyor working for the future Canadian Pacific Railway, on May 25, 1874. Hunter's expedition rafted across the Clearwater River near The Horseshoe, headed east for about , and reached the Murtle River upstream from Majerus Falls. He named the river and, a few days later, Murtle Lake for his birthplace in Scotland, Milton of Murtle, near Aberdeen. Between 1872 and 1881, about 20 survey parties fanned out across British Columbia trying to find the best route for the new railway between Yellowhead Pass in the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast. Three survey parties visited what is now Wells Gray Park. When the more southern Kicking Horse Pass was chosen instead in 1881, all of these meticulously examined routes across the Canadian Cordilleran, including Hunter's, were abandoned. Only three place names in the park recognize those 10 wasted years of surveys: Murtle River and Lake, Mahood River and Lake, and Marcus Falls. The latter two refer to James Adam Mahood and Marcus Smith, leaders of two other railway surveys during the 1870s.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . It was 40 years before the Murtle River area came under professional scrutiny again, this time by land surveyor Robert Lee. In 1913, he laid out lots beside the Murtle River and discovered Helmcken Falls. He was so impressed with the waterfall that he wrote a letter from his remote camp to Sir Richard McBride, British Columbia's premier, asking \\"may I name the river the McBride River and the falls the McBride Falls in honor of the distinguished Premier of British Columbia?\\" This ignored the prior naming of the Murtle River by Joseph Hunter. Three weeks later, Lee received a reply of one sentence from the Premier which stated that the waterfall was to be called Helmcken Falls. The McBride River was not mentioned, so Lee thereafter put Murtle River on his maps. The Mushbowl near Dawson Falls Bridges The first crossing of the Murtle River was at its narrowest point called The Mushbowl and this was a rickety footbridge built in 1914. A horse bridge was completed in 1928 but it consisted of only two stringers and cross logs with no guard rails, and horses were terrified to cross it. It was damaged by high water in 1936 and replaced. When Arthur Wellesley Gray, after whom Wells Gray Park is named, made his ill-fated tour in 1940, he was overcome by dizziness while crossing this bridge and nearly became the first victim of The Mushbowl. The first road bridge was built in 1949 when the road was being extended to Clearwater Lake and it lasted until 1974. Few visitors during those years could resist stopping for a photograph of that attractive Queen's Truss bridge. The present bridge is a narrow Bailey-type bridge on the same site with the Murtle River roaring through The Mushbowl underneath. It is still the only bridge across the Murtle in its entire length. Geological features The Murtle River flows across the huge volcanic Murtle Plateau for the last to the Clearwater. The lava erupted about 200,000 years ago from fissures near McLeod Hill and filled the former valley to depths of up to . The extent of this relatively flat surface is best seen from the viewing tower atop Green Mountain. Pyramid Mountain is a prominent feature beside the Murtle River a few kilometers northeast of the road. It is a subglacial mound which erupted under the ice about 12,000 years ago and built its high cone. Below Helmcken Falls, the Murtle River rushes through Helmcken Canyon for until it meets the Clearwater River. The river is hemmed by sheer lava walls that rise over on each side.

He was a co-founder and former president and chairman of Texas Instruments, Incorporated. Haggerty is most responsible for turning a small Texas oil exploration company into the leader in semiconductors that Texas Instruments is today. Under his influence, the company invested in transistors when their commercial value was still much in question; his company created the first silicon transistor, the first commercial transistor radio, and the first integrated circuit.The Lost History of the Transistor , IEEE Spectrum, May 2004. Early life Pat Haggerty was born in Harvey, North Dakota, the son of Michael Eugene and Lillian (Evenson) Haggerty in 1914. In 1936, Pat graduated summa cum laude from the Marquette University School of Electrical Engineering. Career In November 1945 Haggerty joined Geophysical Service Incorporated (GSI) in Dallas as general manager of the newly formed Laboratory and Manufacturing Division, with responsibility for developing the research, engineering, and manufacturing phases of the company's operations. In December 1951 GSI became Texas Instruments Incorporated. In 1951 Haggerty became executive vice president and director, in 1958 president, and in 1966 chairman, a post he held until retiring. While at Texas Instruments, Haggerty developed his concepts of Strategic Management. This resulted in his objectives, strategies, tactics (OST) system of managing innovation.The Corporation and Innovation, Haggerty, Patrick, Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 2, 97‚Äì118 (1981) Haggerty was active in the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), serving as its president in 1962. He was co-chair of the committee that merged the IRE and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) into the present Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Haggerty was a Fellow of the IEEE. In 1968 Haggery was awarded the IEEE Founders Medal \\"For outstanding contributions to the leadership of the electrical and electronics engineering profession, with special reference to the development of the worldwide semiconductor industry and service to the profession through his contributions leading to the creation of the IEEE.\\". In 1969, he was the IRI Medal recipient, awarded by the Industrial Research Institute.

Kostal had a cabin by the lake which he used when collecting animals from his trapline on Kilpill Mountain. Access Visits to Kostal Lake are rare due to difficult access.

Ideas from probability play an important role in his works on geometry. Biography Bismut's early work was related to stochastic differential equations, stochastic control, and Malliavin calculus, to which he made fundamental contributions. Bismut received in 1973 his Docteur d'√âtat in Mathematics, from the Universit√© Paris-VI, a thesis entitled Analyse convexe et probabilit√©s. In his thesis, Bismut established a stochastic version of Pontryagin's maximum principle in control theory by introducing and studying the backward stochastic differential equations which have been the starting point of an intensive research in stochastic analysis and it stands now as a major tool in Mathematical Finance.[Preface by Paul Malliavin, From probability to geometry (I). Volume in honor of the 60th birthday of Jean-Michel Bismut, Ast√©risque 327, (2009), xv--xvi] [The mathematical work of Jean-Michel Bismut: a brief summary, Ast√©risque 327, (2009), xxv--xxxvii] Using the quasi-invariance of the Brownian measure, Bismut gave a new approach to the Malliavin calculus and a probabilistic proof of H√∂rmander's theorem. He established his celebrated integration by parts for the Brownian motion on manifolds. Since 1984, Bismut works on differential geometry. He found a heat equation proof for the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem. And he established a local version of the Atiyah-Singer families index theorem for Dirac operators, by introducing the Bismut superconnection which plays a central role in modern aspects of index theory. Bismut-Freed developed the theory of Quillen metrics on the smooth determinant line bundle associated with a family of Dirac operators. Bismut-Gillet-Soul√© gave a curvature theorem for the Quillen metric on the holomorphic determinant of a direct image by a holomorphic proper submersion. This and Bismut‚ÄîLebeau's embedding formula for analytic torsions play a crucial role in the proof of the arithmetic Riemann- Roch theorem in Arakelov theory, in which analytic torsion is an essential analytic ingredient in the definition of the direct image. Bismut gave a natural construction of a Hodge theory whose corresponding Laplacian is a hypoelliptic operator acting on the total space of the cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold. This operator interpolates formally between the classical elliptic Laplacian on the base and the generator of the geodesic flow. One striking application is Bismut's explicit formulas for all orbital integrals at semi-simple elements of any reductive Lie group. In 1990, he was awarded the Prix Ampere of the Academy of Sciences. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in the summer of 1984.Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars He was elected as a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1991.

Pitkin, 113 U.S. 545 (1885), was a case brought in error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana to dismiss a writ of error.. When a third party intervenes in a pending suit to claim property in the custody of the marshal by virtue of a writ of attachment issued therein, a judgment dismissing his intervention is final as to that issue, and one distributing the proceeds of the property to other parties is also final. When a writ of error gives the names of all parties as they are found in the record of the case in the court below, and there is nothing in the record to show that there were other parties, the writ is sufficient even if the defendants in error are there described by firm names, as A. B. & Co., &c.; This case distinguished from The Protector, 11 Wall. 82. Motion to dismiss and affirm. The grounds of the first motion were (1) that no copy of the writ had been lodged with the clerk; (2) that no assignment of errors was transmitted with the record; (3) that the writ of error did not set forth the names of the members of the firms mentioned in the writ as defendants, and there was nothing in the record by which the irregularity could be corrected; (4) that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment. Decision Justice Miller delivered the opinion of the Court. A motion was made to dismiss the writ of error in this case on the following grounds: #The writ of error was never served by lodging a copy thereof with the clerk of the court. #No assignment of errors was transmitted with the record, as required by the rules of the court and by ¬ß 997 Rev.Stat. #The writ of error does not set forth the names of the members of the several firms mentioned in the writ as defendants, and there is nothing in the record by which this irregularity may be corrected. #The original petition demands restoration of the goods seized by the marshal to the sheriff on the ground of previous seizure by that officer under an attachment emanating from the state court; the amended petition abandons that ground and goes for priority in the distribution of the proceeds of sale in the marshal's hands, the result of an order of sale pendente lite; such a petition is a mere rule or motion for distribution of proceeds, and a judgment rendered thereon is not reviewable by writ of error. The high court found: #The first appeared to be unfounded in fact, as the record now before us shows that the writ was filed in the circuit court June 14, 1884. #The second was met by the decision of this Court in the case of the School District of Ackley v. Hall, 106 U. S. 428, where it is said that a writ of error will not be dismissed for want of jurisdiction by reason of a failure to annex thereto or return therewith an assignment of errors pursuant to the requirements of ¬ß 997 Rev.Stat. Nor does Rule 8 require a copy of assignment of errors in the transcript when no such assignment was filed in the court below. #The fourth ground of dismissal was equally untenable. The record shows that a large number of the creditors of Joseph Dreyfus, of the City of New Orleans, sued him in the circuit court of the United States, and in those actions or in one of them a writ of attachment was issued and levied on the goods of Dreyfus by the marshal, who took possession of them. The order dismissing Gumbel's intervention disposes of his rights, and is a final judgment as to that issue, as to which he has a right to a writ of error. The order distributing the proceeds of the sale is also final, as it disposes of the fund. As regards the third ground for dismissal, the case is not so clear. This Court has undoubtedly, from the case of Deneale v. Stump, 8 Pet. 526, to that of The Protector, 11 Wall. 82, held that all the parties to the judgment must be named in the writ of error, and that the use of the name of one of the parties, with the addition of the words, \\"and others,\\" as \\"Joseph W. Clark and others,\\" does not satisfy the requirement, but on the contrary shows that there were parties to the judgment or decree in the inferior court who are not named in the writ. It is upon this ground that the judgment in the case of Smith v. Clark, 12 How. 21, is distinctly placed by Chief Justice Taney in the opinion. In the case of The Protector, 11 Wall. 82, the appeal was taken in the name of William A. Freeborn & Co., while the record showed that William A. Freeborn, James F. Freeborn, and Henry P. Gardner were the libellants. In this Court, counsel insisted that the objection was not fatal, and that the appeal might be amended, but the Court held otherwise and dismissed the appeal. The transcript of the record before the court showed that these parties came into the circuit court as defendants or intervenors, and prosecuted their rights throughout the whole proceedings by the designations applied to them in this writ of error and by no other names whatever. No amendment of the writ to remove this difficulty can therefore be made from the record. The court thought that, where the writ gives all the names of the parties as they are found in the record of the case in the circuit court, and where there is nothing to show that any other person was a party than such as are so named, the court is not at liberty to indulge the presumption that there were others who were parties, when such presumption is not founded on anything in the record and would lead to a manifest injustice. The motion to dismiss was overruled, and the case is one to be heard on the merits, and not to be affirmed on motion. Both motions were denied.

In mathematics, the equivariant algebraic K-theory is an algebraic K-theory associated to the category \\\\operatorname{Coh}^G(X) of equivariant coherent sheaves on an algebraic scheme X with action of a linear algebraic group G, via Quillen's Q-construction; thus, by definition, :K_i^G(X) = \\\\pi_i(B^+ \\\\operatorname{Coh}^G(X)).

Specifically, he proved equivariant analogs of fundamental theorems such as the localization theorem. Equivalently, K_i^G(X) may be defined as the K_i of the category of coherent sheaves on the quotient stack [X/G]. (Hence, the equivariant K-theory is a specific case of the K-theory of a stack.) A version of the Lefschetz fixed point theorem holds in the setting of equivariant (algebraic) K-theory.  Fundamental theorems  Let X be an equivariant algebraic scheme.  Examples  One of the fundamental examples of equivariant K-theory groups are the equivariant K-groups of G-equivariant coherent sheaves on a points, so K^G_i(*).

The Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences (Spanish: Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, F√≠sicas y Naturales) is an academic institution and learned society that was founded in Madrid in 1847. It is dedicated to the study and research of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and related sciences. History The forerunner of the modern Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Mathematics, was created in Madrid in 1582, during the reign of Philip II. It evolved from the environment of cooperation among the cosmographers, architects and civil engineers that served the monarch, and also involved prominent artillery experts and military engineers. The initiative was motivated by an interest that existed in the Spain of the late sixteenth century in promoting the teaching of mathematics with an eye to its practical applications in areas as diverse as mercantile calculation, cosmography, astrology on one hand, and the art of navigation and specific problems relating to military skills and construction techniques on the other. The idea of founding the Academy of Mathematics originated with Juan de Herrera, who was also its first director (1583‚Äì1597). It was founded in Lisbon in accordance with documents issued on December 25, 1582, and began functioning in October of the following year in offices of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, and shortly afterwards in its own building nearby \\"at the entrance to Baldan√∫, in la calle del Tesoro\\". The same space is occupied today by the opera house, the Teatro Real. Due to extensive changes in the royal offices, in 1612 the institution moved to the home of the Marquis of Leganes, with its facade on the \\"wide calle of San Bernardo\\" where it carried out its activities until about 1630, when all the property, income and instruments of the Academy were transferred to the Imperial College. Later, with the flowering in Europe during the seventeenth century of academies in the scientific sphere, the Royal Academy of Medicine and Natural Science was founded in 1734. Soon afterwards the Marquis of Ensenada ordered Jorge Juan to divide it into independent branches, and in 1752 the Ordinance Plan for the Royal Society of Sciences of Madrid was drawn up. This project and the Academy collapsed with the fall of Ensenada in 1754 and there was no attempt to revive it until February 7, 1834: a decree for the creation of the Royal Academy of Science in Madrid, subsequently replaced by the Royal Decree for the creation of the Academy of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences, on 25 February 1847. It carried out its first activities in various locations (in the National Museum of Painting in the Tower of Lujanes) until 1897 when it arrived at its current headquarters in the calle Valverde at numbers 22 and 24 (premises that were formerly occupied by the Royal Spanish Academy).Academy Homepage List of Presidents * 1848‚Äì1866: Antonio Rem√≥n Zarco del Valle y Huet * 1866‚Äì1882: Jos√© Solano de la Matalinares * 1882‚Äì1901: Cipriano Segundo Montesino y Estrada * 1901‚Äì1916: Jos√© Echegaray y Eizaguirre * 1916‚Äì1922: Am√≥s Salvador Rodrig√°√±ez * 1922‚Äì1928: Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Carracido * 1928‚Äì1934: Leonardo Torres Quevedo * 1934‚Äì1938: Blas Cabrera y Felipe * 1940‚Äì1958: Jos√© Casares Gil * 1958‚Äì1966: Alfonso Pe√±a Boeuf * 1966‚Äì1970: Julio Palacios Mart√≠nez * 1970‚Äì1985: Manuel Lora Tamayo * 1985‚Äì2002: √Ångel Mart√≠n Municio * 2002‚Äì2005: Carlos S√°nchez del R√≠o y Sierra * 2005‚Äì2009: Alberto Galindo Tixaire * 2009‚Äì2012: Miguel √Ångel Alario y Franco * 2012‚Äì2015: Alberto Galindo Tixaire * 2015‚Äìpresent: Jos√© Elguero Bertolini Structure The Academy is composed of 54 full members, 90 national correspondents, honorary members, and foreign correspondents.

The episode was written and directed by Alan Ball and originally aired in the United States on HBO on September 7, 2008. In the episode, Sookie Stackhouse meets vampire Bill Compton and saves him from vicious vampire drainers, while her best friend Tara becomes the new bartender at Sam Merlotte's bar and Sookie's brother Jason finds himself accused of murder. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. It was rated TV-MA for Adult Content, Adult Language, Nudity, Strong Sexual Content, and Violence. Plot Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), is a blonde, telepathic waitress working at Merlotte's bar in the fictional town of Bon Temps, Louisiana when Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a 173-year-old vampire, enters the bar. Sookie is excited, as he is the first vampire the bar has had since vampires \\"came out of the coffin\\" two years ago. Her boss, Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell), and best friend Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley), are apprehensive about Bill's arrival. Meanwhile, Jason Stackhouse (Ryan Kwanten) learns his sexual partner Maudette Pickens has sex with vampires and allows them to feed on her for money. He engages in rough sex with Maudette, but things take a shocking turn when he begins to choke her. When her body falls limp he panics and flees the scene, unaware the encounter was caught on camera. Back at the bar, the Rattrays, a couple addicted to vampire blood, conspire to trap Bill and drain his blood to sell on the black market. Sookie overhears their plan and tries to convince Sam and Tara to intervene, but they are reluctant to get involved. When Sookie notices Bill and the Rattrays have left, she follows them to find Bill pinned with silver while the Rattrays draw his blood. Sookie successfully drives the couple away and frees Bill. She finds that she cannot hear Bill's thoughts, making him the first person immune to her talent. The next day Jason visits Sookie and Gran (Lois Smith) at home. They all learn that Maudette has been murdered, and Jason quickly blames vampires. Jason's suspicious behavior prompts Sookie to try to read his mind, but he angrily rebuffs her and rushes off to work. There, Sheriff Dearborn and Detective Andy Bellefleur take Jason in for questioning. Sookie learns that Jason has been arrested when she comes to work. She quickly forgets about his situation when Bill returns to the bar. Ignoring the scandalized patrons, Bill and Sookie arrange to meet after the bar closes at 1:30 am. Once he leaves, Sam and Tara scold Sookie for getting involved with a vampire. Rebuffing their concerns, Sookie waits in the empty parking lot where she is brutally attacked by the Rattrays. Title reference \\"Strange Love\\" is the name of a song by Slim Harpo, which plays during the scene where Sookie is talking to Tara while she drinks a margarita. The title \\"Strange Love\\" also refers to the nature of the sex between Jason and Maudette. Cast Bill Maher and P. J. O'Rourke cameo as themselves on a television program discussing the tension between humans and vampires. Jessica Stroup was also cast in the pilot playing a sorority girl named Kelly, she did not return into the show as she chose to star in the spin-off of 90210 playing regular cast as Erin Silver. Production After bringing his critically acclaimed funeral home drama Six Feet Under to a close in 2005, Ball signed a two-year development deal with HBO. As part of the deal, Ball obtained the rights to The Southern Vampire Mysteries, a series of romantic mystery novels by Charlaine Harris. Ball said of the books, \\"Charlaine has created such a rich environment that's very funny and at the same time very scary. I bought the book on impulse and I just couldn't put it down.\\" Carolyn Strauss, who was an executive at HBO at the time, said \\"Alan really fell in love with the books. At its heart, the books are a metaphor for differences and outsiders fitting in. That's Alan's bailiwick and what he writes so well about.\\" After completing filming on his feature directorial debut Towelhead, Ball directed the pilot episode in the Summer of 2007 with cast members Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer, Ryan Kwanten, Sam Trammell and Brook Kerr. On the casting of Paquin as telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse, Ball commented, \\"When I heard Anna wanted to come in and read for Sookie, I was surprised. I thought, 'Well, why does she want to do this, she's a movie star?' ... and then I thought about it and I thought, 'It makes perfect sense, it's a great role.' It's the lead of the show, she's sexy and she's the romantic heroine ... and she gets to play the gamut of human emotion.\\" Continuing he said, \\"Once she came in and she started reading and I started working with her, what she was playing and what I thought really made the character really interesting was I could see that this was a woman who had been hearing other people's thoughts her entire life, and that she was kind of skittish and nervous and jumpy and a little angry.\\" On casting Stephen Moyer as vampire Bill Compton Ball said, \\"It was a really hard role to cast, we saw a lot of men ... and then I saw Stephen ... and there was something so, for lack of a better word, real about him and this sort world-weary but tragic feeling that he brought to it. Aside from being really, really handsome, which helps.\\" Brooke Kerr, who was best known for her role on the NBC soap opera Passions, originally played the character of Tara Thornton. However, she was replaced by Rutina Wesley after the second episode had been filmed. On August 9, 2007, HBO took True Blood to series, ordering an additional eleven episodes for a full season order with Ball acting as executive producer and showrunner. At that point, Ball had already written the next two episodes. An early version of the pilot was leaked online in June 2008 and was met with fairly negative reviews from online bloggers. Reception Critical reaction The series premiere received generally favorable reviews. Robert Bianco from USA Today called it \\"... a much-needed infusion of new, well, blood.\\" and said \\"Blood proves there's still vibrant life‚Äîor death‚Äîleft in the \\"star-crossed lovers\\" paradigm.\\" Tom Shales of The Washington Post called True Blood \\"an audacious, outrageous, grisly comic drama ...\\" and said the show \\"isn't meant to be an exercise in good taste. Just a romp and a wallow ‚Äì and a bloody good one.\\" Robert Abele from LA Weekly called the series an \\"effortlessly entertaining potboiler about the allure of dangerous attraction after probably a few too many shows drearily dissecting broken relationships.\\" Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel praised True Blood as being \\"one of the strongest new series in an uncertain fall ... Alan Ball has adapted Charlaine Harris' novels with wit, verve and passion.\\" Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle praised the performances in the episode, saying Paquin is \\"deceptively intriguing\\" and that both she and Moyer \\"do well here.\\" Alan Sepinwall gave the series a fairly negative review, saying \\"... It's the kind of show where you have to care a lot more about vampires than I do to stick around for long.\\" He went on to say, \\"most of it is really not worth seeing.\\" Michael Judge from The Wall Street Journal said the series \\"too often passes over the truly macabre or grotesque for gratuitous sex and violence\\" and then said \\"I know True Blood is supposed to be a sexy, easy-to-swallow mystery, but too often it ends up leaving a bad taste in one's mouth.\\" James Poniewozik from Time magazine called Ball's characters \\"caricatures\\" and continued by asking \\"Was the world dying for an HBO show with no subtext? Take away the graphic sex, and True Blood could air on USA Network.\\" The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan said \\"The overheated melodrama sometimes makes the lives of these people seem faintly ridiculous...\\" Ratings The episode was viewed by approximately 1.4 million people upon its initial broadcast. After a repeat showing later the same night, those figures rose to 2.1 million. When on-demand viewings and additional broadcasts are factored in, the episode was viewed by approximately 4 million viewers.

An example of dual-homed devices are enthusiast computing motherboards that incorporate dual Ethernet network interface cards. Usage In Ethernet LANs, dual-homing is a network topology whereby a networked device is built with more than one network interface. Each interface or port is connected to the network, but only one connection is active at a time. The other connection is activated only if the primary connection fails. Traffic is quickly rerouted to the backup connection in the event of link failure. This feature was designed to provide telecommunications grade reliability and redundancy to Ethernet networks. Multihoming is a more general category, referring to a device having more than one network connection. In firewalls Firewall dual-homing provides the first-line defense and protection technology for keeping untrusted bodies from compromising information security by violating trusted network space. A dual-homed host (or dual-homed gateway) is a system fitted with two network interfaces (NICs) that sits between an untrusted network (like the Internet) and trusted network (such as a corporate network) to provide secure access. Dual-homed is a general term for proxies, gateways, firewalls, or any server that provides secured applications or services directly to an untrusted network. Dual-homed hosts can be seen as a special case of bastion hosts and multi-homed hosts. They fall into the category of application-based firewalls. Dual-homed hosts can act as firewalls provided that they do not forward IP datagrams unconditionally.

Ingersoll was born in Manila, The Philippines, and he was the son of Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll, and the grandson of Rear Admiral Royal R. Ingersoll. After graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1934, Ingersoll served on the battleship USS California (BB - 44), on the destroyer USS Cassin (DD-372), and other warships during 1934 - 41, and he reported on board the aircraft carrier USS Hornet (CV-8) during her fitting-out (pre-commissioning) period in 1941. Lieutenant Ingersoll served on the Hornet during the critical early months of the War in the Pacific, including on the famous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo in April 1942, the Hornet's maiden combat voyage. Ingersoll served on board the USS Hornet during the Battle of Midway from 4 June to 6 June 1942, in which the portion of the U.S. Navy fleet based in Hawaii decisively defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during its attack on Midway Island, sinking four IJN Japanese aircraft carriers. Lt. Ingersoll was killed at his battle station by machine gun fire from a crippled fighter plane (an F4F Wildcat) from the (CV-5) during its emergency landing on board the Hornet. Its wounded pilot was either unable to, or failed to, cut off its guns. Four enlisted men on board the Hornet were also killed, and 20 more sailors were wounded in this accident. In 1942, the destroyer USS Ingersoll (DD-652) was named in honor of both Rear Admiral Royal R. Ingersoll and Lt. Royal R. Ingersoll II. Lt. Ingersoll's father, Admiral Royal E.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves of Nazi Germany. Early life and career Hitschhold was born on 7 July 1912. After completing the Abitur, he began military service in the Reichswehr cavalry on 1 April 1930. Hitschhold and was selected for and began flight training. Hitschhold received his commission in March 1931 and was promoted to Leutnant on 1 March 1934. Part of the training was conducted at the Lipetsk fighter-pilot school at Lipetsk Air Base, Soviet Union. This military cooperation was secret and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. In January 1933 the Nazi Party seized power under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. Cooperation ceased. The Reichswher was renamed the Wehrmacht; the Nazi German Armed Forces. In March the Luftwaffe (Air Force) was founded with the creation of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (Reich Air Ministry; RLM) in March 1933. The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force) was created to control all aspects of aerial warfare. Hitschhold transferred to the organisation. Initially he transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) for further training in early 1935. On 1 October 1935 Hirschold was promoted to Oberleutnant. He moved to the Sturzkampfgeschwader (Dive-bomber wings) I./StG 162, then II. and III./StG 162. On 1 October 1936 Hitschold was appointed a Staffelkapit√§n (squadron leader) in I./StG 163, commanding 1 staffel. In 1936 it began equipping with the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. The staffel, along with the gruppen (groups) were reformed into Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 \\"Immelmann\\" on 1 May 1939. Hitschhold commanded 1./StG 2. Histchhold held the rank of Hauptmann upon the appointment [dated 1 January 1939]. World War II StG 2 was subordinated to Luftflotte 4 in May 1939 and initially subordinated to the 2 Fliegerddivision (2nd Flying division), Luftflotte 4 and based at Nieder-Ellguth in Silesia. The wing formed part of the dive-bomber fleet with StG 1, StG 51, StG 76, and StG 77. The wing was to form the southern part of Case White, the Invasion of Poland in September 1939. The invasion was to act in unison with the Soviet invasion of Poland and it began World War II in Europe. The purpose of the division was to provide close air support to the 8th,10th and 14th army. The division was reinforced by Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, commanding VIII. Fliegerkorps (8th Flying Corps), a specialised ground attack air corps. Richthofen was formally transferred to Luftflotte 4 in the first week of September 1939. In September 1939 Richthofen's force was a mere flying command (Fliegerfuhrer zbV). Poland On 1 September 1939, the Wehrmacht invaded Poland. I./StG 2 began the invasion with 37 combat ready aircraft from 38. On the first day, I Gruppe bombed Wielu≈Ñ, with other elements of the wing. The StG 76 and 77 were also involved in the bombing against the undefended town which may have occurred when faulty intelligence reports asserted the existence of a Polish cavalry formation was present.Krak√≥w, Katowice and Wadowice were bombed by the group on the first day of the invasion. Luftflotte 4's bombers dropped 389 tons of bombs on 1 September, 200 on Krak√≥w in 1,200 sorties. Leutnant Frank Neubert and Unteroffizier Frank Kilnger from Hitschhold's staffel are believed to have claimed the first aerial victory of the war against a PZL P.11. Captain Mieczys≈Çaw Medwecki, 121 Squadron, was taking off from Balice airfield. On 2 September I./StG 2 were credited with having devastated a large Polish Army force detraining in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. The gruppe supported the advance to Czƒôstochowa then engaged in the Siege of Warsaw. Hitschhold's group assisted in the destruction of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army's cavalry brigades alongside Richthofen's forces. I./StG 2 then fought in the Battle of the Bzura which destroyed Army Pozna≈Ñ and Army Pomorze; it bombed Polish forces in and around the I≈Ç≈ºa forest. Hitschhold's unit then bombed rail targets in support of the Battle of Radom and Battle of Modlin. Hitschhold was appointed as Gruppenkommandeure (Group Commander) of I./StG 2 on 16 October 1939, ten days after the Polish capitulation. Hitschhold transferred to Golzheim. I./StG 2 trained their during the Phoney War. Over the winter, 1939, Hitschhold's gruppe trained to knock out Belgian fortresses at Liege and opposite Maastricht, in the Netherlands in preparation for Fall Gelb. StG 2 was transferred to Richthofen in October 1939. In January 1940 it was probably located at Marburg. StG 2 crews undertook training in Graz, Austria. Targets were marked out with silhouettes to represent battleships to prepare the wing for anti-surface warfare. Western Europe On 10 May 1940 Hitschhold commanded a group of 40 Ju 87B dive bombers; 33 were combat ready. StG 2 remained under Richthofen's air corps command, part of Luftflotte 2, belonging to Albert Kesselring. During the Battle of France and Battle of Belgium, StG 2 transferred to Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3. Hitschhold's gruppe attacked Fort Eben-Emael. The Battle of Fort Eben-Emael was crucial in allowing the German Army to breach Belgian Army fortifications along the border. The gruppe carried out attacks against Belgian reserves moving to the frontline. The Belgian efences in the region crumble the following afternoon, after the French 7e Division d'Infanterie failed to relive them under attack from StG 2 and Lehrgeschwader 2. On 11 May Hitschhold's I./StG 2 continued operations over Belgium in support of the 6th army crossing the Maas river. The operations were successful but costly. Five Ju 87s were shot down near Tirlemont 42 km east-south-east of Brussels in combat with Hawker Hurricanes of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force. Three of his men were killed in action, one wounded in action and one was captured. Their assailants were from No. 87 Squadron RAF. 11 Ju 87s from I. and II./StG 2 were lost to 3, 87 and No. 607 Squadron RAF, despite fighter protection from Jagdgeschwader 27. Over Louvain the following day, Hitschhold lost two more aircraft to 3 Squadron. Hitschhold's group supported the 3rd Panzer Division and 4th Panzer Division at the Battle of Hannut. They conducted a 30-minute attack against Thisnes and Crehen to break the French Cavalry Corps. The group fought in support of the Battle of Gembloux on 15 May. Over 15‚Äì17 May, Hitschhold's group moved to Saint-Quentin, Aisne. The capture of Liege airfield permitted close air support units to focus on the Battle of Sedan. The airfield came under artillery fire from forts still occupied by the Belgians until StG 2 intervened. StG 2 remained to support the 6th army's advance through the Dyle line before switching to support the 12th army for two days, south of Namur from 18 May. The wing contributed 200 sorties to the Sedan operation. StG 2 and 77 intervened in the Battle of Arras on behalf of Erwin Rommel's 7th Panzer Division. StG 2 advanced into north-eastern France during the ash to the English Channel. It fought during the Siege of Calais and Battle of Boulogne. The ports were taken after bombardment from StG 2 and 77. Hitschhold's commanding officer Oskar Dinort lost both wingmen over Boulogne on 25 May. Four were lost. In a major action, Dinort led 39 Ju 87s and two gruppen in an attack on Admiral James Somerville's forces off Calais on 24 May. The 10th Panzer Division requested air support against Royal Navy warships bombarding their positions as the division fought its way into Calais. Dinort ordered Hitschhold to select a target. The light cruisers Arethusa, Galatea, and destroyers Grafton, Greyhound, Verity, Wessex, Wolfhound, Vimiera and Polish Navy destroyer Bzura were subjected to an intense dive bombing attack. Wessex was sunk, Vimiera and Bzura was damaged. The Ju 87s suffered no loss in their unopposed attacks. Six of the Wessex crew were killed and 15 wounded. From 29 May Hitschhold led his formation in the Battle of Dunkirk until 2 June 1940, attacking shipping and Royal Navy vessel supporting Operation Dynamo. I./StG 2 spent 5‚Äì7 June reorganising. From 8 June in supported the 6th and 9th army in crossing the Seine and Marne. It supported the 9th army's advanced on Laon. Hitschhold's group lost three crews on 8 June. Hitschhold operated over Longpont, north-east of Paris and the group claimed to have destroyed 20 to 30 French tanks preparing a counterattack north-east of the capital. Thereafter Hitschhold flew in the battles of P√©ronne, Roye, Chauny and Nogent. I./StG 2 provided air cover in the advances through Yonne and Loire. By the Armistice of 22 June 1940, Hitschhold's command had lost 13 aircraft. Battle of Britain  In July 1940 the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht initiated plans for Operation Sea Lion, the invasion of the United Kingdom. The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe began an air offensive codenamed Operation Eagle Attack. The objective was the destruction of RAF Fighter Command in south-eastern England. The Luftwaffe began bombing British convoys in the English Channel to draw Fighter Command into battle and deplete its strength. The first phase of what became the Battle of Britain was termed the Kanalkampf (Channel War). Hitschhold's I./StG 2 moved to Falaise in Normandy. The group transferred to Laon-Couvron. It staged through the Pas de Calais for attacks on the Channel convoys. In late July it relocated to Cherbourg. The group was placed under Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII. The group was equipped with 35 aircraft with 29 operational. Hitschhold and first group were involved in the battles from 4 July. That morning Convoy OA 178 (convoy outbound atlantic) of 14 heavily laden merchantmen left the Thames Estuary, bound for the west coast and passed Dover safely on 3 July. German radar picked up the convoy and the Luftwaffe was ordered to intercept the ships. A Junkers Ju 88 reconnaissance aircraft from 1.(F)/123 flew over the Channel and reported that the convoy was south- west of Portland. I./StG 2 took off, led by Geschwaderkommodore Oskar Dinort and Hitschhold, from Falaise, Calvados with 24 Ju 87s, escorted by a Staffel of fighters from I./JG 1. The attack was followed by 23 Ju 87s of III./StG 51 after they had been hastily re-fuelled and rearmed. The ships were close to the French coast; Dallas City was damaged, engulfed in flames and collided with Flimson which was also hit and the ships took 15 minutes to disengage; Dallas City later sank. Antonio limped into Portland Harbour with Flimson. Deucalion (1,796 GRT), Kolga (3,526 GRT) and Britsum (5,225 GRT) were sunk and SS Canadian Constructor, was damaged for no Luftwaffe loss. On 21 July 1940 Hitschhold was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and promoted to Major as Gruppenkommandeur of I./Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 \\"Immelmann\\". On 8 August Hitschhold was involved in a large series of battles over Convoy Peewit. In the late morning StG 2, 3 and 77 from Angers, Caen and St. Malo were escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 110s from V./LG 1, to attack the convoy south of the Isle of Wight, with about 30 Bf 109s from II. and III./JG 27 for cover. Supermarine Spitfires of 609 Squadron and Hurricanes from 257 and 145 squadrons attacked the German formations, joined later by 238 Squadron. The Ju 87s severely damaged SS Surte, MV Scheldt and SS Omlandia and sank SS Balmahasoon after. SS Tres was sunk by StG 77. SS Empire Crusader, in the lead, was hit by StG 2 and sank several hours later; four ships were sunk and four were damaged in the attacks. From 20 to 30 RAF fighters attacked the German aircraft and I. and II./StG 2 suffered one damaged Ju 87 each, StG 3 lost three Stukas from I. Gruppe and two damaged. On 13 August Hitschhold and II./StG 2 commanded by Walter Enneccerus, were ordered to attack RAF Andover with the support of StG 1, along with RAF Warmwell and Yeovil. I./JG 53 flew a fighter sweep ahead of the bombers from Poole to Lyme Regis in order to tempt the RAF into battle. The sweep failed to attract or divert RAF squadrons. Instead, it succeeded in alerting the RAF defences a critical five minutes earlier. When the main wave of StG 2 arrived over the coast, they were greeted by 77 RAF fighters. II., and III./JG 53 and III./ZG 76 flew escort for the Ju 87s. The whole of No. 10 Group RAF intercepted. One Staffel of II./StG 2 was badly hit by No. 609 Squadron RAF; six out of nine Ju 87s were shot down. StG 1 and 2 gave up on their original targets owing to heavy cloud cover. Both headed for Portland. On 15 August Hitschhold's group stood down while the other gruppen engaged in the large air battles of the day. On 16 August, StG 2 was fully committed nearly 100 Ju 87s to an attack on RAF Tangmere. Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 2 provided escort. The Ju 87s reached the airfield and carried out a devastating attack before Fighter Command could intercept. 1, 43, 601 and 602 Squadrons caught the Ju 87s as they exited the target area. Hitschhold's gruppe was attacked by 43 Squadron. The Hurricanes destroyed five of his Ju 87s and damaged three. Only one crew member was rescued. StG 2 was not involved in the battles on the 18 August, after which the Ju 87s was withdrawn from the air superiority campaign. Ju 87 units sat idle on the French coast for the duration of the battle. In the winter 1940, these groups carried out sporadic attacks against coastal shipping. In September 1940 the group provided pilots and aircraft for the propaganda film Stukas. Thereafter, it trained for Operation Felix, an attack on Gibraltar, until it was abandoned in January 1941. Balkans and Mediterranean From 5/6 January 1941 I./StG 1 staged from St Malo to Graz in Austria. By 23 January Hitschhold's gruppe moved into airfields at Otopeni, north of Bucharest in Romania. Hitschold moved down to Kraynitsi, south-south-west of Sofia in Bulgaria. On 6 April the group mustered 39 Ju 87s for operations. On this date it supported Fliegerkorps VIII operations in the Invasion of Yugoslavia and Battle of Greece. It bombed positions in Petric and played a role in the Battle of the Metaxas Line. Hitschhold may have been involved in Operation Retribution, the bombing and destruction of central Belgrade. The group bombed British Army concentrations in Arta, Greece from 9 April and supported the advance on Salonika and Skopje. Hitschhold's command facilitated the breakthrough at Kastoria which routed the Epirus Army in the Battle of Lake Kastoria. Through the remainder of April 1941, Hitschhold supported the advance on Olympia, Larissa, Volos, and the German land forces at the Battle of Thermopylae. The group supported paratroop drops on Corinthia and advance into Peloponesia. The group staged through Larissa to Corinth. From 22 April Histchhold's group attacked Allied shipping in the Megara Gulf. I./StG 2 found target-rich waters in the Gulf of Corinth where, at Antikyra, the 1,300-ton tanker Theodora and 657-ton coastal tanker Theodol were sunk by 2 staffel. The Greek destroyer Hydra was sunk in the Gulf of Megara on 22 April. In total the Hellenic Navy lost four torpedo boats‚ÄîGreek torpedo boat Kios among them‚Äîthree mine-layers and with Allied naval forces a further 43 merchant ships totalling 63,975 tons to the 23 April. Hitschhold's group flew daily attacks against shipping near and around Crete. Hitschhold's men probably sank the Greek destroyer Hydra at Piraeus naval base, which lost 23 vessels in two days. Greek destroyer Psara was sunk at anchor off Megara. Other Ju 87s from I./StG 2 sank other Greek merchant vessels in the Gulf Corinth. Operation Demon‚Äîthe Allied evacuation from Greece‚Äîreached its peak; three-quarters of 60,000 men were evacuated. The I./StG 2 under the command of Hitschhold participated in the Battle of Crete, which ended the fighting in the Balkans until 1944. StG 2, with KG 2 and KG 26, bombarded anti-aircraft artillery positions before 493 Junkers Ju 52 transports began dropping German paratroops over the Cretian airfields. Hitschhold's group achieved success on 22 May. The group sank the cruiser Gloucester with five 1,000 lb bombs. 45 officers and 648 men were killed. Hitschhold watched the ship sink in 35 minutes as he circled above. Hitschhold's unit contributed to the sinking of Fiji in the same action. The damaged Fiji was later sunk by Bf 109 fighter-bombers. On 22 May 1941, Captain Louis Mountbatten led four destroyers under over of darkness past Antikythera island to bombard Maleme airfield. In the morning they were spotted at 07:55 hours by more than 20 Ju 87s led by Gruppenkommandeur Hitschhold. The dive- bombers attacked immediately. They sank the British destroyers Greyhound on 22 May 1941 and the Kelly and Kashmir on 23 May 1941. After taking a hit amidships, Kashmir sank in less than two minutes. Hitschold lost four of his Ju 87s. 131 crewmen died aboard Kelly and 80 on Kashmir. Photograph taken by a German airman recording the sinking of Gloucester, 22 May 1941. The vast majority of her crew perished On 30 May Rear Admiral Irvine Glennie's Force D, consisting of the cruisers , and were intercepted by Hitschhold's unit, which was now operating from Rhodes. They damaged Orion and Dido. I./StG 2 assisted in the sinking of destroyer Hereward. III./StG 2 struck the fatal blow. The end of the campaign came on 1 June. The gruppe claimed 164,000 tons of shipping sunk. If accurate, it amounted to nearly half the 360,000 tons lost by the Allied powers. Eastern Front Hitschhold departed Rhodes for Cottbus, and then moved eastward to Przasnysz, 88 km north-east of Warsaw in German-occupied Poland. Hitschhold commanded 35 Ju 87s. StG 2 remained with Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII, subordinated to Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.On 22 June Hittschhold was shot down but rescued. On the first three days of the invasion, from 22‚Äì24 June 1941, Hitschhold was ordered to support the 9th Army and 3rd Panzer Army, the spearhead of Army Group Centre. Hitschhold's group assisted the breakthrough at Suwa≈Çki on 25 June, and engaged in anti-tank operations 80 km south of Grodno. He led II./StG 2 in the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk, advance on Vilnius, Lepel, Vitebsk to force a bridgehead over the Dnieper. On 11 July the group attacked rail lines from Vitebsk to Smolensk, before supporting the destruction of the Smolensk pocket. On 8 August, Hitschhold was ordered north, to support the 16th army and Army Group North. The group supported the breach of the Velikaya River line, and the advance to Staraya Russa near Lake Ilmen. From 27 August to 8 September close air support was flown in support of XXVIII Army Corps and XXXIX Panzer Corps to Schl√ºsselburg at the mouth of the Neva River. On 9 September, Hitschhold's group fought along the northern front depending on the situation as Army Group North neared Leningrad. Interdiction operations were flown against the Leningrad‚ÄìMoscow rail lines. In mid-September I./StG 2 was based at Velizh deep inside the Soviet Union. From this point it enforced the Siege of Leningrad. Hitschhold's crews focused on the Baltic Fleet at Kronstadt. All three gruppen were equipped with new heavier armoured-piercing bombs that arrived at Tyrkovo airfield. During these combat operations, one of Hitschhold's men, a then unknown Hans-Ulrich Rudel, sank the Soviet battleship Marat at the cost of several Ju 87s. A notable casualty was Staffelkapit√§n Ernst Kupfer, who survived. Kupfer flew three missions on 28 September, and on each mission his aircraft was badly damaged. The Soviet destroyer Minsk, and Steregushchi were sunk in the same raid. I./StG 2 moved to Army Group Centre once more for the Battle of Moscow on 2 October 1941. Hitschhold fought at Vyazma and Kalinin in support of the 3rd Panzer Army and 9th Army. The group flew in support of operations to relieve the 1st Panzer Division from a potential encirclement. On 15 October Hitschhold was relieved of command of I/StG 2. Hitschhold was moved to the 1st Dive-bomber school as an instructor, and on 31 December 1941 he was awarded the 57th Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves with a promotion to Major for his service as Gruppenkommandeur of I./Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 \\"Immelmann\\". Oberstleutnant Hubertus Hitschhold replaced Otto Wei√ü as commanding officer of Schlachtgeschwader 1 on 18 June 1942. Hitschhold's appointment came prior to the beginning of Operation Blue, the summer offensive into the Caucasus. The wing operated the Bf 109E and Henschel Hs 129 in the ground-attack role. Schl.G. 1 flew ground attack and counter air operations. On 8 July was ordered to attack the airfield at Kamesnk to relieve pressure on the army from the Red Air Force. It claimed 20 aircraft, yet no more than one two were actually destroyed. By 20 July, the wing had only 36 aircraft operational after the battles across the Donets and Don River. In August Hitschhold led the wing in the Battle of Kalach and Battle of Stalingrad. On 19 November 1942 the Red Army began Operation Uranus. The offensive broke through north and south of Axis lines around Stalingrad and encircled the German, Italian, Hungarian and Romanian armies in and around the city. Hitschhold's wing did contribute to the destruction of the Soviet 5th Tank Army's 8th Cavalry Corps at Oblivskaya on 26 November. The aircraft went into action as ground personnel from his command manned the trenches around the town. The last of the Soviet tanks was purportedly destroyed at the edge of SG 1's airfield. Hitachhold's second group lost eight aircraft in these battles. By 1 December 1942, it possessed just five Hs 129s, 10 Bf 109E-7s and 11 Henschel Hs 123s. Hitschhold's crews supported Operation Winter Storm, and assisted the Italian Army in Russia escape destruction in the Soviet Operation Little Saturn. On 16 and 17 December 1942 the specialised 4.(Pz)/SG. 1 destroyed ten Soviet tanks with their six Hs 129s, now armed with MK 101 cannon. Within three days, Italian lines had collapsed, and II./Schl.G. 1 abandoned Millerovo, as the 18th Tank Corps approached. Second group in particular, flying from the Rossosh area on 6 December 1942, attacked Soviet armoured spearheads attacking the 3rd Romanian and 8th Italian Army. By 22 December it had pulled back to Voroshilovgrad. Among the successes, was the repulse of a tank attack by the 1st Guards Army against Antonovka near Millerovo on 2 January 1943; which was defeated largely because of the tank- busting formations from II./SG 1. The 3rd Guards Army approached Morozovsk, forcing 7. Staffel to abandon some Hs 123s there. In 1943 Hitschhold's main successful contribution was the support of the Waffen SS at the Third Battle of Kharkov, which allowed the Germans to recapture the city and Belgorod. In May first group converted to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. It was positioned in the Izyum sector until July 1943. SG 1 was not afforded any rest. Elements moved southwest of Rostov-on-Don, and fought in the Taman Peninsula, at the Kuban bridgehead in support of the 17th Army. General der Schlachtflieger The Kuban was Hitschhold's last battle in the field. In June 1943 he was relieved of command from SG 1 on 10 June and promoted to Oberst. Hitschhold was appointed Fliegerf√ºhrer Sardinien, responsible for the coordination of air units in Sicily. Fliegerf√ºhrerLuftflotte 2 Fliegerkorps II's previous headquarters at Viterbo was appropriated by Fliegerf√ºhrerLuftflotte 2 under Hitschhold. Hitschhold was directly subordinated to Fliegerkorps II. Hitschhold was to assume command of all the bomber, fighter, reconnaissance and ground-attack units in support of the 10th Army. Hitschhold's command failed to repulse the Allied invasion of Sicily. In September 1943 the Allied invasion of Italy succeeded in gaining a foothold on continental Europe. Naples was captured and only the Air raid on Bari yielded any success. On 1 January 1944 Hitschhold was appointed General der Schlachtflieger, a position he held until 8 May 1945. Hitschhold advocated ending Ju 87 production in favour of the Fw 190. Production ended only in September 1944. On 1 January 1945 Hitschhold was promoted to Generalmajor, a position he held until the German surrender in May 1945.

Early years Born in Madrid, Spain, into a family of musicians, Rodolfo Halffter was the brother of Ernesto Halffter and uncle of Crist√≥bal Halffter, also composers. His father Ernest Halffter Hein came from K√∂nigsberg, Germany. His mother was Rosario Escriche Errad√≥n, a Catalan who taught the first music lessons to her children. Career Rodolfo Hallfter was self-taught as a composer and in the 1930s took part in the intellectual environment of Madrid, particularly in the composers' society \\"Grupo de los Ocho\\" or \\"Grupo de Madrid\\". This group was influenced by Spanish musician Adolfo Salazar (1890-1958), who encouraged them to innovate and introduced them to the avant-garde music of the time, including the works of Debussy, Schoenberg, Ravel and Bart√≥k. It was in this period that Halffter wrote the majority of his most important works, and at the same time he worked as a music critic in La Voz as well as in the propaganda ministry of the Republican government (as compared to his brother Ernesto, who supported Franco). Because of this relationship, he went into exile in Mexico at the end of the Spanish Civil War. In Mexico he taught in the National Conservatory and was director of Ediciones Mexicanas de M√∫sica. He never quit composing and always kept the influence of the \\"Grupo de los Ocho\\". His works tend to develop in a free polytonality with a classicism in a Scarlatti style. It is believed that Rodolfo Halffter brought serialism to Mexico. Halffter returned to Spain on many occasions after 1963, teaching in Granada and Santiago de Compostela and taking part in music festivals. He was awarded Spain's highest award for composition, the Premio Nacional de M√∫sica, in 1986. He died in Mexico in 1987.

Initially it was planned to name the bridge Bank Bridge, but this name was already taken by Bank Bridge. Demidov Bridge railings  History  In the beginning of the 18th century, at the location of the modern Demidov Bridge, there existed wooden bridge, named Saarsky Bridge, since it was on the road to Tsarskoe Selo. In 1834-1835 the single-span arched cast iron bridge was constructed by the project of the engineers E.A. Adam and Pierre-Dominique Bazaine. The arched span of the bridge consisted of 91 cast iron boxes, which were fastened by the bolts. Bridge supports were made from stone, coated by granite.  Decorations  The casting of the bridge railings has high artistic value. Their ornament has a form of palmettes (artistic motif based on the fan-shaped leaves of a palm tree). Bridge entrance features floor lamps. In 1954‚Äì1955 the restoration project took place under supervision of architect A.L. Rotach. The lost lamps, poles and railing fragments were replaced.

The tobacco is germinated in cold frames or hotbeds and then transplanted to the field until it matures. It is grown in warm climates with rich, well-drained soil. About 4.2 million hectares of tobacco were under cultivation worldwide in 2000, yielding over seven million tonnes of tobacco.FAO projections of tobacco production, consumption, and trade to the year 2010 (2003) http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/006/Y4956E/Y4956E00.HTM Sowing and growth Tobacco cultivation in a dry river bed, Tireli, Mali, 1980 Tobacco seeds are scattered onto the surface of the soil, as their germination is activated by light. In colonial Virginia, seedbeds were fertilized with wood ash or animal manure (frequently powdered horse manure). Seedbeds were then covered with branches to protect the young plants from frost damage, and the plants were left alone until around April. In the 19th century, young plants came under increasing attack from certain types of flea beetles, Epitrix cucumeris or Epitrix pubescens, which destroyed half the U.S. tobacco crops in 1876. In the years afterward, many experiments were attempted and discussed to control the flea beetle. By 1880, growers discovered that replacing the branches with a frame covered with thin fabric effectively protected plants from the beetle. This practice spread, becoming ubiquitous in the 1890s. In Asian, Oceania, and the Indian subcontinent, the tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera litura) is a great pest to the tobacco plant. The caterpillar's vigorous eating habits can cause up 23-50% in yield losses, resulting in economic strain to the local agricultural economies. The cabbage looper is also known to have caused damage to tobacco plants in North Carolina, which became a concern as farmers lacked a suitable method for controlling the caterpillars. Shade tobacco is the practice of growing the plants under a screen of cheesecloth fabric. The thin leaves were used for the outer wrappings of cigars. Harvest Basma leaves drying in the sun at Pomak village of Xanthi, Greece, 2001 Tobacco harvesters in the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) around 1920. Tobacco can be harvested in several ways. In the oldest method, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a sickle. In the nineteenth century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. As the plants grow, they usually require topping and suckering. \\"Topping\\" is the removal of the tobacco flowers while \\"suckering\\" is the pruning out of leaves that are otherwise unproductive. Both procedures ensure that as much of the plant's energy as possible focuses on producing the large leaves that are harvested and sold. \\"Cropping\\", \\"Pulling\\", and \\"Priming\\" are terms for removing mature leaves from tobacco plants. Leaves are cropped as they ripen, from the bottom to the top of the stalk. The first crop of leaves located near the base of the tobacco stalk are called \\"sand lugs\\" in more rural southern tobacco states. They are called \\"sand lugs\\" because these leaves are close to the ground and get splashed with sand and clay when heavy rains hit the soil. Sand lugs weigh the most, and are most difficult to work with. Their weight is due to their large size and the added weight of soil; slaves lugged each stack to the \\"stringer\\" or \\"looper\\", typically a female slave, who bundled each stack of leaves. Eventually, workers carried the tobacco and placed it on sleds or trailers. As the industrial revolution approached America, the harvesting wagons that transported leaves were equipped with man powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested by a single piece of farm equipment, though topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand. Some farmers still use \\"tobacco harvesters\\". They are not very efficient yet highly cost effective for harvesting premium and rare strains of tobacco. The harvester trailers for in-demand crops are now pulled by diesel fueled tractors. \\"Croppers\\" or \\"primers\\" pull the leaves off in handfuls and pass these to the \\"stringer\\" or \\"looper\\", which bundles the leaves to a four-sided pole with twine. These poles are hung until the harvester is full. The poles are then placed in a much larger wagon to be pulled by modern farm tractors to their destination. For rare tobaccos they are often cured on the farm. Traditionally, the slaves who cropped and pulled had a particularly tough time with the first pull of the large, dirty, base leaves. The leaves slapped their faces and dark tobacco sap, which dries into a dark gum, covered their bodies, and then soil stuck to the gum. The croppers were men, and the stringers, who were seated on the higher elevated seats, were women and children. The harvesters had places for one team of ten workers: eight people cropping and stringing, plus a packer who moved the heavy strung poles of wet green tobacco from the stringers and packed them onto the pallet section of the harvester, plus a horseman. The outer seats were suspended from the harvester - slung out over to fit into the rows of tobacco. As these seats were suspended it was important to balance the weight of the two outside teams (similar to a playground see-saw). Having too heavy or light a person in an unbalanced combination often resulted in the harvester tipping over especially when turning around at the end of a row. Water tanks were a common feature on the harvester due to heat and danger of dehydration. Global production Trends Production of tobacco leaf increased by 40% between 1971, during which 4.2 million tons of leaf were produced, and 1997, during which 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced.Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \\"Projection of tobacco production, consumption and trade for the year 2010.\\" Rome, 2003. According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the UN, tobacco leaf production is expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010. This number is a bit lower than the record high production of 1992, during which 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.Higher World Tobacco use expected by 2010-growth rates slowing down.\\" (Rome, 2004). The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%.Rowena Jacobs, et. al, \\"The Supply-Side Effects Of Tobacco Control Policies,\\" in Tobacco Control in Developing Countries, Jha and Chaloupka eds., Oxford University Press, 2000. During that same time period, production in developed countries actually decreased. China's increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production. China's share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997. This growth can be partially explained by the existence of a high import tariff on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff has been reduced from 64% in 1999 to 10% in 2004,Hu T-W, Mao Z, et al. \\"China at the Crossroads: The Economics of Tobacco and Health\\". Tobacco Control. 2006;15:i37‚Äìi41. it still has led to local, Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost. Every year 6.7 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world. The top producers of tobacco are China (39.6%), India (8.3%), Brazil (7.0%) and the United States (4.6%).US Census Bureau-Foreign Trade Statistics, (Washington DC; 2005) Major producers Worldwide tobacco production =United States= In the United States, as of 2014 North Carolina was the largest producer of tobacco, with around 1,800 tobacco farms employing 30,000 workers yielding in 400 million pounds of the crop annually. In the US, the decline in the number of smokers, the end of the Tobacco Transition Payment Program in 2014, and competition from growers in other countries, made tobacco farming economics more challenging as of 2015. =China= At the peak of global tobacco production, there were 20 million rural Chinese households producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land.Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \\"Issues in the Global Tobacco Economy\\" While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugar cane. This is because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price because of the lack of market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) in 1982. STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports; and contributed 1.3% to national income between 1982 and 2004.People's Republic of China. \\"State Tobacco Monopoly Administration <>. =Brazil= In Brazil around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity. Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the country's total cultivated area.International Tobacco Growers' Association. \\"Tobacco Farming: Sustainable Alternative.\\" Volume II East Sussix: In the southern regions of Brazil, Virginia and Amarelinho flue-cured tobacco as well as Burley and Dark (Galp√£o Comum) air-cured tobacco are produced. These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes. In the northeast, darker, air-cured and sun-cured tobacco are grown. These types of tobacco are used for cigars, twists and dark-cigarettes. Brazil's government has made attempts to reduce the production of tobacco but has not had a successful systematic anti-tobacco farming initiative. Brazil's government, however, provides small loans for family farms, including those that grow tobacco, through the Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar (PRONAF).High Level Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor. \\"Report from South America.\\" 2006. =India= India has 96,865 registered tobacco farmersShoba, John and Shailesh Vaite.

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \\"Issues in the Global Tobacco Economy\\" Since 1947, the Indian government has supported growth in the tobacco industry. India has seven tobacco research centers that are located in Jeelugumilli, A.P., Kandukuru, A.P., Guntur, A.P., Kalavacherla, A.P., Hunsur, Karnataka., Vedasandur, Tamil Nadu, Dinhata, West Bengal and Rajamundry houses the core research institute. The government has set up Tobacco Board, Guntur which works to increase exports of Indian tobacco. Guntur is also well known place for tobacco plantation. The Central Tobacco Research Institute works under the aegis of Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Tobacco crop is cultivated in an area of 0.45 M ha (0.27% of the net cultivated area) producing ‚âà750 M kg of tobacco leaf. India is the 2nd largest producer and exporter (in quantity terms) after China and Brazil, respectively. The production of Flue-Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco is about 300 million kg from an area of 0.20 M ha while 450 M kg non-FCV tobacco is produced from an area of 0.25 M ha. In the global scenario, Indian tobacco accounts for 10% of the area and 9% of the total production. By virtue of the dominant role played by this commercial crop, the Indian Central Tobacco Committee (ICTC) established Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) in Rajahmundry (Andhra Pradesh) in 1947. The Institute was under the administrative control of ICTC, Madras from 1947 to 1965 and subsequently transferred to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi. ICAR acts as a repository of information and provides consultancy on agriculture, horticulture, resource management, animal sciences, agricultural engineering, fisheries, agricultural extension, agricultural education, home science, and agricultural communication. It has the mandate to co-ordinate agricultural research and development programmes and to develop linkages at national and international level with related organisations to enhance the quality of life of the farming community.haryana also in fact it is a very important place in which tobacco comes fro almost all of the india's tobacco comes from the state haryana Problems in tobacco production =Child labor= The International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in agriculture, which is one of the most hazardous types of work.ILO. International Hazard Datasheets on Occupations: Field Crop Worker The tobacco industry houses some of these working children. There is widespread use of children on farms in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi and Zimbabwe.UNICEF, The State of the World's Children 1997 (Oxford, 1997); US Department of Agriculture By the Sweat and Toil of Children Volume II: The Use of Child Labor in US Agricultural Imports & Forced and Bonded Child Labor (Washington, 1995); ILO Bitter Harvest: Child Labour in Agriculture (Geneva, 1997); ILO Child Labour on Commercial Agriculture in Africa (Geneva 1997) While some of these children work with their families on small family-owned farms, others work on large plantations. In late 2009 reports were released by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world's tobacco) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-2008 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay, long hours as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors.Plan International. \\"Malawi Child Tobacco Pickers' '50-a-day habit\\" http://plan- international.org/about-plan/resources/media-centre/press-releases/malawi- child-tobacco-pickers-50-a-day-habit/?searchterm=tobacco They also reported suffering from green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes worth of nicotine through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function. In 2014, Human Rights Watch released a report detailing child labor on U.S. tobacco farms. The report states 73% of the children they interviewed reported getting sick with nausea, headaches, respiratory illnesses, and skin conditions, while 66% reported symptoms consistent with acute nicotine poisoning. The report states most children they interviewed worked between 10 and 12 hours per day and some children reported earning less than minimum wage with deductions by the contractor or grower for drinking water or for reasons that were not explained to them. In United States children were found to be working for twelve hours in Tobacco Fields. Families that farm tobacco often have to make the difficult decision between having their children work or go to school. Unfortunately working often beats education because tobacco farmers, especially in the developing world, cannot make enough money from their crop to survive without the cheap labor that children provide. =Economy= A large percent of the profits from tobacco production go to large tobacco companies rather than local tobacco farmers. Also many countries have government subsidies for tobacco farming. Major tobacco companies have encouraged global tobacco production. Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco each own or lease tobacco manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries.\\"International Cigarette Manufacturers,\\" Tobacco Reporter, March 2001 This encouragement, along with government subsidies has led to a glut in the tobacco market. This surplus has resulted in lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. According to the World Bank, between 1985 and 2000 the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37%.14\\\\. Tobacco Free Kids. \\"Golden Leaf, Barren Harvest: The Costs of Tobacco Farming.\\" http://tobaccofreekids.org/campaign/global/FCTCreport1.pdf =Environment= Tobacco production requires the use of a large amount of pesticides. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field.Taylor, Peter, \\"Smoke Ring: The Politics of Tobacco\\", Panos Briefing Paper, September 1994, London Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce bigger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, the waterway and the food chain.FAO Yearbook, Production, Volume 48, 1995 Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.National Research Council, 1995, Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children, National Academy Press. Tobacco is often heavily fertilized. Some of the mineral apatite in Florida used to produce phosphate for American tobacco crops contains uranium, radium, lead-210 and polonium-210 and radon. The radioactive smoke from tobacco fertilized this way is deposited in lungs and releases radiation even if a smoker quits the habit. The combination of carcinogenic tar and radiation in a sensitive organ such as lungs increases the risk of cancer. If the smoker also breathes in the asbestos fibers which commonly occur in urban and industrial environments, the risk of cancer is greatly increased. References Further reading *Evan P.

History The Venice Shoreline Crips formed in Venice's Oakwood neighborhood, which was originally labeled as a \\"servant's zone\\" by Venice founder Abbot Kinney and one of the few places within a mile of California's coastline where blacks could own property. Due to restrictive covenants that enforced racial segregation, Oakwood was set aside as a settlement area for blacks and the population increased rapidly as hundreds moved to Venice to work in the oil fields during the 1930s and 1940s. Into the 1950s, the City of Los Angeles had neglected Oakwood so much that it became known as \\"the ghetto by the sea\\" with unpaved narrow streets leading to run down bungalows, many of which lacked foundations. While unemployment soared with the closing of the oil fields, the 1960s brought drugs and racial tensions to Oakwood and gang membership began to rise among the already established Venice 13 gang. Inspired by the Black Power Movement and after a series of militant black riots in Venice in the late 1960s the Shoreline Crips were founded alongside some of the original Crip gangs formed by Tookie Williams and Raymond Washington in South Central Los Angeles. In the 1980s as crack cocaine was introduced and gangs began focusing more on money rather than their original politics, the Shoreline Crips became heavily involved in the narcotics business in Oakwood and on the Venice Boardwalk as well. Leading into the 1990s gunfire was heard nightly as the Shorelines warred with rival Culver City 13 after Shoreline cliques were pushed out of the Mar Vista Gardens projects. Shortly after, Oakwood exploded as a war broke out between the Shorelines and Venice 13 over control of the Venice drug trade until a cease-fire was arranged between the two gangs. In the 1980s and 1990s, newly arrived white homeowners took residency in and around the area, causing Los Angeles to combat the gang problem. Although even after a series of raids, injunctions, and other measures against them, the Shorelines have maintained a steady control over their territory with their numbers ranging in the several hundreds. Notoriety In November 1980 a Venice Crip member was arrested for the murder of Sarai Ribicoff, niece of Senator Abraham Ribicoff, in a robbery outside a Washington Blvd restaurant. The war with the Culver City Boyz spilled into the lives of many not affiliated with gangs as bystanders and parents began being shot at on a regular basis.

Religions range from condemning any gender variance to honoring transgender people as religious leaders. Views within a single religion can vary considerably, as can views between different faiths. Abrahamic religions There are many different interpretations of creation stories in Abrahamic religions in which God creates people \\"male and female\\". This is sometimes interpreted as a divine mandate against challenging the gender binary and also for challenging the gender binary. Bah√° º√≠ Faith In the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, transgender people can gain recognition in their gender if they have medically transitioned under the direction of medical professionals and if they have sex reassignment surgery (SRS). After SRS, they are considered transitioned and may have a Bah√° º√≠ marriage. Christianity The New Testament presents eunuchs (Greek eunochos, similar to Hebrew saris) as acceptable candidates for evangelism and baptism, as demonstrated in the account of the conversion of an Ethiopian eunuch. While answering questions about marriage and divorce, Jesus says that \\"there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.\\" Discussion has occurred about the significance of the selection of the Ethiopian eunuch as being an early gentile convert to Christianity: the inclusion of a eunuch, representing a sexual minority, in the context of the time. Some Christian denominations accept transgender people as members and clergy: *In 2003, the United Church of Christ General Synod called for full inclusion of transgender persons. *In 2005, Sarah Jones became the first openly transgender person to be ordained by the Church of England as a priest: the first trans person to minister in the Church of England was Carol Stone, who had been ordained in 1978 and transitioned in 2000. *In 2008, the United Methodist Church Judicial Council ruled that openly transgender pastor Drew Phoenix could keep his position. At the UMC General Conference the same year, several petitions that would have forbidden transgender clergy and added anti- transgender language to the Book of Discipline were rejected. In 2017, the United Methodist Church commissioned its first non-binary clergy member, a transgender non-binary deacon named M Barclay. Also, Joy Everingham was the Methodist Church in Great Britain's first openly transgender minister. *In 2012, the Episcopal Church in the United States approved a change to their nondiscrimination canons to include gender identity and expression. *In 2013, Shannon Kearns became the first openly transgender person ordained by the North American Old Catholic Church. He was ordained in Minneapolis. *In 2014, Megan Rohrer became the first openly transgender leader of a Lutheran congregation (specifically, Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church of San Francisco.) *In 2017, the General Synod of the Church of England passed a motion stating, \\"That this Synod, recognising the need for transgender people to be welcomed and affirmed in their parish church, call on the House of Bishops to consider whether some nationally commended liturgical materials might be prepared to mark a person's gender transition.\\" The Catechism of the Catholic Church, promulgated in 1992, does not mention transgender issues directly. In 2000, the Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith sent a confidential document to church leaders reportedly stating that sex- change procedures do not change a person's gender in the eyes of the Church. A person familiar with the document told the Catholic News Service, \\"The key point is that the (transsexual) surgical operation is so superficial and external that it does not change the personality. If the person was a male, he remains male. If she was female, she remains female.\\" The document reportedly concludes that a \\"sex-change\\" operation could be morally acceptable in certain extreme cases, but that in any case transgender people cannot validly marry. Pope Benedict XVI denounced gender studies, warning that it blurs the distinction between male and female and could thus lead to the \\"self- destruction\\" of the human race. He warned against the manipulation that takes place in national and international forums when the term \\"gender\\" is altered. \\"What is often expressed and understood by the term 'gender,' is definitively resolved in the self-emancipation of the human being from creation and the Creator\\", he warned. \\"Man wants to create himself, and to decide always and exclusively on his own about what concerns him.\\" Benedict said this is humanity living \\"against truth, against the creating Spirit\\". In 2015, the Vatican declared that transgender Catholics cannot become godparents, stating in response to a transgender man's query that transgender status \\"reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality\\" and that, \\"[t]herefore it is evident that this person does not possess the requirement of leading a life according to the faith and in the position of godfather and is therefore unable to be admitted to the position of godfather or godmother.\\" Pope Francis stated in 2016 that \\"biological sex and the socio-cultural role of sex (gender) can be distinguished but not separated\\". Individual Catholics have held a range of positions regarding transgender issues. Apologist Tim Staples has stated that experiencing gender dysphoria is not sinful but transgender surgeries such as sex reassignment surgery are morally impermissible. Theologian James Whitehead has said, \\"The kind of transition that trans people are talking about is very similar to the journey of faith through darkness and desert that people have been making for thousands of years.\\" In 2006, Albert Mohler, then president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said \\"Only God has the right to determine gender\\", adding, \\"any attempt to alter that creation is an act of rebellion against God.\\" He also stated, \\"Christians are obligated to find our definitions ‚Ä¶ in the Bible. What the activists want to call 'sex-reassignment surgery' must be seen as a form of bodily mutilation rather than gender correction. The chromosomes will continue to tell the story...Gender is not under our control after all. When a nation's moral rebellion comes down to this level of confusion, we are already in big trouble. A society that can't distinguish between men and women is not likely to find moral clarity in any other area of life.\\" In 2014, the Southern Baptist Convention approved a resolution at its annual meeting stating that \\"God's design was the creation of two distinct and complementary sexes, male and female\\" and that \\"gender identity is determined by biological sex, not by one's self-perception\\". Furthermore, the resolution opposes hormone therapy, transition-related care, and anything else that would \\"alter one's bodily identity\\", as well as opposing government efforts to \\"validate transgender identity as morally praiseworthy\\". Instead, the resolution asks transgender people to \\"trust in Christ and to experience renewal in the Gospel\\". The 2020 General Handbook of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints states that transgender persons and their families and friends \\"should be treated with sensitivity, kindness, compassion, and an abundance of Christlike love\\".\\"Transgender Individuals\\" General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ¬ß 38.6.22. Transgender individuals may be baptized and confirmed as members of the church and receive other gender-neutral ordinances, but they may not receive sex- specific ordinances such as priesthood ordination or temple ordinances (including the endowment and celestial marriage). These sex-specific ordinances are received according to \\"birth sex\\". The church discourages medical, surgical, and social transitioning, and doing so by a member may result in membership restrictions. The church takes no position on the causes of people identifying as transgender. =Unitarian Universalism= Unitarian Universalism, a liberal religion with roots in liberal Christianity, became the first denomination to accept openly transgender people as full members with eligibility to become clergy (in 1979), and the first to open an Office of Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Concerns (in 1973). In 1988 the first openly transgender person was ordained by the Unitarian Universalist Association. In 2002 Rev. Sean Dennison became the first openly transgender person in the Unitarian Universalist ministry called to serve a congregation; he was called to South Valley UU Society, Salt Lake City, UT. Also in 2017, the Unitarian Universalist Association's General Assembly voted to create inclusive wordings for non-binary, genderqueer, gender fluid, agender, intersex, two-spirit and polygender people, replacing the words \\"men and women\\" with the word \\"people.\\" Of the six sources of the living tradition, the second source of faith, as documented in the bylaws of the denomination, now includes \\"Words and deeds of prophetic people which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love\\". Islam In Islamic literature, the word mukhannathun is used to describe \\"effeminate men\\". The term has sometimes been equated to transgender women, gay men, members of a third gender, or intersex individuals, though it does not neatly fit into any of those categories. The treatment of mukhannathun varied throughout early Islamic history, and the meaning of the term took on new dimensions over time. In some eras, men deemed mukhannathun were persecuted and castrated, while in others they were celebrated as musicians and entertainers. In later years, the term came to be associated with the receptive partner in gay sexual practices, as homosexuality was seen as an extension of effeminacy. In the late medieval era, several Islamic scholars held that mukhannathun who had innate feminine mannerisms were not blameworthy as long as they did not violate religious laws concerning sexual morality. Due to Ayatollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa allowing sex reassignment surgery for intersex and transgender individuals, Iran carries out more sex change operations than any other nation in the world except for Thailand. It is sanctioned as a supposed \\"cure\\" for homosexuality, which is punishable by death under Iranian law. The government even provides up to half the cost for those needing financial assistance and a sex change is recognised on the birth certificate. Judaism Jewish views of transgender people have varied by time and denomination. Rabbinic Jewish texts discuss six sex/gender categories. The term saris, (◊°÷∏◊®÷¥◊ô◊°) generally translated to English as \\"eunuch\\" or \\"chamberlain\\",Strong's Concordance, #5631 appears 45 times in the TaNaKh. It frequently refers to a trusted but gender-variant person who was delegated authority by a powerful person. It is unclear whether most were in fact castrated. In Isaiah 56, God promises eunuchs who keep the Sabbath and hold fast to his covenant that he will build an especially good monument in heaven for them, to make up for their childlessness. Tumtum (◊ò◊ï◊û◊ò◊ï◊ù in Hebrew, meaning \\"hidden\\") is a term that appears in Jewish Rabbinic literature and usually refers to a person whose sex is unknown, because their genitalia are covered or \\"hidden\\". A tumtum is not defined as a separate gender, but rather a state of doubt. Androgynos (◊ê◊†◊ì◊®◊ï◊í◊ô◊†◊ï◊° in Hebrew, translation \\"intersex\\") refers to someone who possesses both male and female sexual characteristics. The nature of the individual's gender is ambiguous. =Orthodox Judaism= Orthodox Jewish religious authorities assert that gender is an innate and eternal category which is based on verses in the Book of Genesis about Adam and Eve and the creation of maleness and femaleness. The removal of genital organs is forbidden on the basis of the prohibition against \\"anything which is mauled, crushed, torn or cut\\" (Lev. 22:24). A further prohibition in Deut. 22:5, proscribes not only cross-dressing but any action uniquely identified with the opposite sex, and this would also apply to an operation to transform sexual characteristics. See also There are Orthodox authorities who recognize the efficacy of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in changing halachic sex designation. Despite the religious-legal challenges presented by transgender Jews, some Orthodox rabbis recognize the high rates of suicide attempts among transgender Orthodox Jews and advocate for steps to reduce the risks of mental illness and community rejection. Orthodox Union senior policy director Rabbi Dr. Tzvi Hersh Weinreb has spoken publicly since 2016 about the need to support transgender Orthodox Jews and their families with compassion. =Hasidic Judaism= Hasidic Judaism currently makes no place for trans people, as everything in the community is determined by gender roles. Most Hasidic Jews are barely aware of trans people, and the topic is never discussed altogether. The first person to come out as trans in a Hasidic community was trans activist and writer Abby Stein, who is also a direct descendant of Hasidic Judaism's founder the Baal Shem Tov. When Stein came out she was shunned by her family, and received much scorn from the Hasidic community. =Conservative Judaism= Conservative Judaism has mixed views on transgender people. In 2003 the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards approved a rabbinic ruling that concluded that sex reassignment surgery (SRS) is permissible as a treatment of gender dysphoria, and that a transgender person's sex status under Jewish law is changed by SRS. There have not yet been any openly transgender rabbis or rabbinical students affiliated with Conservative Judaism. But the Jewish Theological Seminary, one of three Conservative movement schools, openly admits students of all sexual orientations and gender identities for rabbinical training and ordination. Also, Emily Aviva Kapor, who had been ordained privately by a \\"Conservadox\\" rabbi in 2005, came out in 2012, thus becoming the first openly transgender female rabbi in all of Judaism. In 2016 the Rabbinical Assembly, which is the international association of Conservative rabbis, passed a \\"Resolution Affirming the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People\\". =Reform Judaism= Reform Judaism has expressed positive views on transgender people. Reform Judaism's Central Conference of American Rabbis first addressed the issue of transgender Jews in 1978, when they deemed it permissible for a person who has undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) to be married according to Jewish tradition. In 1990, the Central Conference of American Rabbis declared that people who have undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) may convert to Judaism. In 2002 at the Reform seminary Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York, Rabbi Margaret Wenig organized the first school-wide seminar at any rabbinical school which addressed the psychological, legal, and religious issues affecting people who are transsexual or intersex. In 2003 Reuben Zellman became the first openly transgender person accepted to Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion; he was ordained there in 2010. Also in 2003, the Union for Reform Judaism retroactively applied its pro-rights policy on gays and lesbians to the transgender and bisexual communities, issuing a resolution titled, \\"Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities.\\" Also in 2003, Women of Reform Judaism issued a statement describing their support for human and civil rights and the struggles of the transgender and bisexual communities, and saying, \\"Women of Reform Judaism accordingly: Calls for civil rights protections from all forms of discrimination against bisexual and transgender individuals; Urges that such legislation allows transgender individuals to be seen under the law as the gender by which they identify; and Calls upon sisterhoods to hold informative programs about the transgender and bisexual communities.\\" In 2006 Elliot Kukla, who had come out as transgender six months before his ordination, became the first openly transgender person to be ordained by the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. In 2007 the Union for Reform Judaism issued a new edition of Kulanu, their resource manual for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender inclusion, which for the first time included a blessing sanctifying the sex-change process. It was written by Elliot Kukla at the request of a friend of his who was transgender. Also in 2007, David Saperstein of the Religious Action Center called for a trans-inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act. In 2015 the Union for Reform Judaism passed a \\"Resolution on the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People\\" with 9 points calling for securing and defending the rights of transgender and gender non-confirming people to respectful and equitable treatment and affirming its own commitment to continued pursuit of same. =Reconstructionist Judaism= Reconstructionist Judaism has expressed positive views on transgender people. In 2003 the Reform rabbi Margaret Wenig organized the first school-wide seminar at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College which addressed the psychological, legal and religious issues affecting people who are transsexual or intersex. In 2013 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association issued a resolution stating in part, \\"Therefore be it resolved that the RRA [Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association] directs its executive director and board to move forward, in cooperation with the RRC [Reconstructionist Rabbinical College] and all relevant associated entities, in educating RRA members about issues of gender identity, to urge the Reconstructionist movement to similarly educate its constituency and to adopt policies that will do all that is possible to provide full employment opportunities for transgender and gender nonconforming rabbis, and to explore how the Reconstructionist movement can best influence the wider Jewish and non-Jewish world to [be] welcoming and inclusive of all people, regardless of gender identity.\\" In 2017, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association approved a resolution committing themselves to work for \\"full inclusion, acceptance, appreciation, celebration and welcome of people of all gender identities in Jewish life and in society at large\\"; the resolution also \\"strongly advocates for the full equality of transgender, non- binary, and gender non-conforming people and for equal protections for people of all gender identities under the law, at all levels of government, in North America and Israel.\\" =Other= In 1998, after she won the Eurovision song competition, a serious religious debate was held as to whether, and how, Dana International (a transgender woman) should pray in a synagogue. One rabbinical authority concluded that Dana should be counted in a minyan as a man, but could not sing in front of the community since she was also a woman, according to the rabbi, and that would violate the Orthodox rule of kol isha. In January 2015 a transgender Jewish woman, Kay Long, was denied access to the Western Wall, first by the women's section and then by the men's section.Transgender woman denied entry to Western Wall YNET News, 6 January 2015Transgender woman prevented from accessing Western Wall Haaretz, 7 January 2015 Long's presence was prevented by \\"modesty police\\" at women's section who are not associated with the rabbi of the Western Wall or the site administration. They are a group of female volunteers who guard the entrance to the women's section preventing entry to visitors who are not dressed to their idea of Orthodox modesty standards for women. The director of Jerusalem's Open House, a community center for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, noted that Long's experience was not unique. \\"Gender separation at the Western Wall is harmful for transgender people. This is not the first story that we know of with transgender religious people that wanted to go to the Western Wall and pray and couldn‚Äôt,\\" said Elinor Sidi, who expected that the battle for access to the Western Wall for the LGBTQ community would be a long and difficult one.Transgendered woman barred from Western Wall prayer Times of Israel, 7 January 2015 It was later asserted that Kay Long would have been permitted in the women's section except for her clothing. \\"It was not an issue of her gender, but the way she was dressed.\\" Several non-denominational Jewish groups provide resources for transgender people. Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life published an LGBTQ Resource Guide in 2007. Jewish Mosaic has published interpretations of Jewish texts that affirm transgender identities. Keshet, an LGBT Jewish advocacy group, has assisted American Jewish day schools with properly accommodating transgender students.Amanda Borschel-Dan, Why Jewish communities welcome 7-year-old transgender kids, Times of Israel, 24 April 2015 Australian Aboriginal The Rainbow Serpent Ungud has been described as androgynous. Shaman identify their erect penises with Ungud, and his androgyny inspires some to undergo ceremonial penile subincision.Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 329, \\"Ungud\\" Angamunggi is another Rainbow Serpent, worshipped as a \\"giver of life\\".Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 58, \\"Angamunggi\\" Other Australian mythological beings include Labarindja, blue-skinned wild women or \\"demon women\\" with hair the colour of smoke.R√≥heim (2008), p. 388 May 2014 Stories about them show them to be completely uninterested in romance or sex with men, and any man forcing his attention upon them could die, due to the \\"evil magic in their vaginas\\". They are sometimes depicted as gynandrous or intersex, having both a penis and a vagina. This is represented in rituals by having their part played by men in women's clothes.Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 211, \\"Labarindja\\" Chinese religions Eunuchs, male-bodied people castrated for royal services, existed in China from 1700 BC until 1924 AD. This social role had a long history, with a continuous community, and a highly public role. Before being castrated a Chinese eunuch would be asked if he \\"would ever regret being castrated\\" and if the answer was \\"no\\" then surgery would take place. It's an open question as to who would answer this way and why. The historical status of Chinese eunuchs was a curious mixture of extreme weakness and great power. The allure of power and influence were sometimes offered as excuses for the decision to become a eunuch. It has been speculated that Chinese monarchs trusted their eunuchs because the inability to have children left them with no motivation to seek power or riches. It is not clear to what extent eunuchs were transgender or otherwise gender-variant, but the history of eunuchs in Chinese culture is important to its views on transgender people. Classical myth The patron god is Dionysus, a god gestated in the thigh of his father Zeus, after his mother died from being overwhelmed by Zeus's true form. Aphroditus was an androgynous Aphrodite from Cyprus with a religious cult in which worshipers cross-dressed,Macrobius, Saturnalia iii.8 in later mythology became known as Hermaphroditus, the son of Hermes and Aphrodite who merged bodies with the water nymph Salmacis, transforming him into an androgynous being. In Phrygia there was Agdistis, a hermaphroditic being created when Zeus unwittingly impregnated Gaia. The gods feared Agdistis and Dionysus castrated her; she then became the goddess Cybele.Pausanias, Description of Greece vii.17.¬ß 5 In addition, Norse gods were capable of changing gender at will, for example Loki, frequently disguised himself as a woman and gave birth to a foal while in the form of a white mare, after a sexual encounter with the stallion Sva√∞ilfari. Comparison of a man to a child-bearing woman was a common insult in Scandinavia, and the implication that Loki may be bisexual was considered an insult. Human fertility was a major aspect of Egyptian mythology, and was often entwined with the crop fertility provided by annual flooding of the river Nile. This connection was shown in iconography of Nile-gods, such as Hapi, god of the Nile, and Wadj-wer, god of the Nile Delta, who although male were depicted with female attributes such as pendulous breasts, symbolizing the fertility the river provides.Conner & Sparks (1998), p.170, \\"Hapy\\" Indian religions Buddhism In Thai Buddhism, being kathoey (an umbrella term that roughly maps to a range of things from MtF transsexualism to male homosexuality) is seen as being part of one's karma if it should be the case for a person. The response is one of \\"pity\\" rather than \\"blame\\". Kathoey are generally seen as not likely to form lasting relationships with men, and the lay explanation of their karma is that they are working out debts from adulterous behavior in past lives. In the past they disrupted marriages, and now they are doomed to never marry. In Thailand, kathoey are still not allowed to legally become female or marry a man. Same-sex marriage is not possible in Thailand. Transgender women however can marry their European partners, if that is legislatively possible in their partner's country, and leave Thailand. Hinduism Hijras or Aravanis ‚Äì ritually marry the Hindu god Aravan and then mourn his ritual death (seen) in an 18-day festival in Koovagam, India. Hindu philosophy has the concept of a third sex or third gender (tritiya-prakriti ‚Äì literally, \\"third nature\\"). The people in this category of sex/gender are called Hijras in Hinduism. This category includes a wide range of people with mixed male and female natures such as homosexuals, transsexuals, bisexuals, the intersexed, and so on. Such persons were not considered fully male or female in traditional Hinduism, being a combination of both. They are mentioned as third sex by nature (birth) and were not expected to behave like ordinary men and women. Hijras identify themselves as incomplete men, that they do not have the desires (for women) that other men do. This lack of desire they attribute to a \\"defective organ.\\" If a Hijra is not born with a \\"defective\\" organ (and most are not), he must make it so by emasculation. They often kept their own societies or town quarters, performed specific occupations (such as masseurs, hairdressers, flower-sellers, domestic servants, etc.) and were generally attributed a semi-divine status. Their participation in religious ceremonies, especially as crossdressing dancers and devotees of certain temple gods/goddesses, is considered auspicious in traditional Hinduism. Some Hindus believe that third-sex people have special powers allowing them to bless or curse others. However, these beliefs are not upheld in all divisions of Hinduism. In Hinduism, the universal creation is honored as unlimitedly diverse and the recognition of a third sex is simply one more aspect of this understanding. = Transgender people in ancient Hindu society = Within the Hindu context, Hijras have always been considered a part of the third gender diaspora, and hence the term Hijra, Transgender or Third gender will be used interchangeably. Due to their classification as third gender and being sexually neutral, Transgender people, especially the devotees of Lord Krishna, have been historically shown to bestow blessings. Being sexually neutral was considered especially auspicious in Vedic culture because the attraction between a man and woman was thought to create further attachments such as children due to procreation, and a home in terms of property, which would result in the living entities being entangled in samsara, the cycle of repeated birth and death. The people of the third sex have had a prominent role in the arts and entertainment. Historically referred to as Nartaka, at the birth of a baby Nartaka dancers would arrive, dance and sing the name of the God Krishna and bless the baby. As per custom, they were given precious jewellery and silks by the family of the baby for their contribution. One more example of Transgender people being portrayed in Hindu history is that of Lord Arjuna being depicted as Brihannala in the Mahabharata, who was a person of third gender. Brihanalla was shown to be an instructor singing and dancing in King Virata's court. But Lord Arjuna/ Brihanalla was first tested for his third-sex nature by assuring he had no lust for females, and would have been examined for testicles if he had been a eunuch. This is not the first example of the presence of a person of third gender in Hindu texts, but this example most pertains to the topic of third gender people and their auspiciousness. = Transgender people in contemporary Indian society = In October 2013, \\"India's Supreme court stated that transgenders have remained untouchable in society with restricted access to education, health care and jobs. The justices criticized the government for such discrimination during a hearing of public interest litigation filed by the National Legal Services Authority\\". This problem for Hijras first began during the British rule (1757-1947) with the introduction of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in 1860 which declared homosexuality as a crime, and had an extended listing which has declared \\"Transgenders as criminal elements in society\\". Transgender people have been treated as outcasts within Indian society and thus have been \\"deprived of social and cultural prticipation for nearly two centuries.\\" Many biologically male Hijras undergo a ritualized castration called nirva (sex reassignments). They have limited access to education, health care and public facilities and are treated as nonentities legally, which is in violation of the Constitution of India. Despite being recognized as legal citizens, only an estimated 25% of transgender people have obtained the national identification (Aadhar card). Transgender people are unable to \\"exercise their democratic rights in marriage, adopting/raising children and utilizing financial support system such as free and subsidized health care, surgeries and medical treatments\\". There has been some support for transgender people as \\"The Supreme Court has directed the central government to place transgendered people in the other backward classes (OBCs) to classify their castes denoting their socially and economically disadvantaged status in society\\" as they fall within the classification of people as defined in Article 15 (4) of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court of India has directed all Indian states to build separate restrooms for transgender people, and \\"to establish welfare agencies to enhance their health and medical needs.\\" Neopagan religion In most branches of Wicca, a person's status as trans- or cisgender is not considered an issue. Transgender people are generally magickal people, according to Karla McLaren in her Energetic Boundaries study guide. Transgender people are almost always welcomed in individual communities, covens, study groups, and circles. Many transgender people were initially attracted to Modern Paganism because of this inclusion. However, there are some Neopagan groups that do not welcome transgender people. In some cases, this is because of the emphasis on the union of male and female, and the exclusion of transgender individuals from such practices. Also, some gender separatist groups exclude transgender people, often on the basis that non-transgender individuals share certain spiritual qualities derived from genetic or biological sex. Dianic Wicca is an example of such a separatist group. Pacific Islands Third gender, or gender variant, spiritual intermediaries are found in many pacific island cultures, including the bajasa of the eastern Toradja people of Sulawesi, the bantut of the Taus≈´g people of the south Philippines, and the bayoguin of the pre-Christian Philippines. These shamans are typically biologically male but display feminine behaviours and appearance, and are often homoerotically inclined.Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 81, \\"Bajasa\\"Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 82, \\"Bantut\\"Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 85, \\"Bayoguin\\" The pre-Christian Philippines had a polytheistic religion, which included the hermaphroditic gods Bathala and Malyari, whose names means \\"Man and Woman in One\\" and \\"Powerful One\\" respectively; these gods are worshipped by the Bayagoin.Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 84, \\"Bathala\\"Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 225, \\"Malyari\\" The Big Nambas speakers of Vanuatu have the concept of divinely approved-of homoerotic relationships between men, with the older partner called the \\"dubut\\". This name is derived from the word for shark, referring to the patronage of the shark-human hybrid creator god Qat.Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 90, \\"Big Nambas\\" Among their pantheon of deities, the Ngaju people of Borneo worship Mahatala-Jata, an androgynous god. The male part of this god is Mahatala, who rules the Upper World, and is depicted as a hornbill living above the clouds on a mountain-top; the female part is Jata, who rules the Underworld from under the sea in the form of a water-snake. These two manifestations are linked via a jewel-encrusted bridge that is seen in the physical world as a rainbow. Mahatala-Jata is served by \\"balian\\", female hierodules, and basir\\", transgender shamans metaphorically described as \\"water snakes which are at the same time hornbills\\".Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 224, \\"Mahatala-Jata\\" Similar transgender shamans, the manang bali (which literally means a transformed shaman from a male into a woman), are found in the Iban people in Borneo such as in Sarawak. Manang bali is the third and highest degree of shamanism after accomplishing the second degree of manang mansau \\"cooked shaman\\" and the first degree of manang mataq \\"uncooked shaman\\". The initiation ceremony for becoming a manang bali is called \\"Manang bangun manang enjun\\" which can be literally translated as the Awakened shaman, shaken shaman.\\"Manangism\\" By the Venerable Archdeacon J. Perham After this ceremony, a manang bali dresses and acts like women and have homoerotic relationships. This makes them both the target of ridicule and respected as a spiritual intermediary. Boys fated to become manang bali may first dream of becoming a woman and also of being summoned by the god of medicine Menjaya Raja Manang or the goddess Ini Inee or Ini Andan, who is regarded the natural-born healer and the god of justice.Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 225, \\"Manang bali\\" Menjaya Raja Manang began existence as a malegod, until their brother Sengalang Burong's wife became extremely sick. This prompted Menjaya into becoming the world's first healer, allowing him to cure his sister-in-law, but this treatment also resulted in Menjaya changing into a woman or androgynous being.Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 230, \\"Menjaya Raja Manang\\" Menjaya was consecrated as the first manang bali by his own sister, Ini Inee Ini Andan in the first ever awakening- shaking ceremony and the first healing by a name-changing \\"belian\\" curing rite. Shinto Shinto kami associated with same-sex love or gender variance include: shiraby≈çshi, female or transgender kami represented as half-human, half-snake. They are linked to Shinto priests of the same name, who are usually female (or occasionally transgender) and perform ceremonial dances in traditional men's clothing; ≈åyamakui no kami, a transgender mountain spirit that protects industry and childbearing (notably enshrined in Hie Shrine);Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 259, \\"Oyamakui\\" and Inari ≈åkami, the kami of agriculture and rice, who is depicted as various genders, the most common representations being a young female food goddess, an old man carrying rice, and an androgynous bodhisattva. Inari is further associated with foxes and Kitsune, shapeshifting fox trickster spirits. Kitsune sometimes disguise themselves as women, independent of their true gender, in order to trick human men into sexual relations with them.Conner & Sparks (1998), p. 203, \\"Kitsune\\" Common belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox.Tyler (1987), xlix.

It may be less risky for a defending player in possession of the ball to deliberately concede a rushed behind, rather than try to prevent any score outright. A deliberately rushed behind results in a free kick to the opposing side unless under extreme pressure. Rushed behinds are statistically credited to no player; scoresheets will simply include the tally of total rushed behinds credited to a team's score. It is impossible for a defending team to directly concede a \\"rushed goal\\" worth six points. Free kick for conceding a deliberate rushed behind Since 2009, it has been illegal in AFL matches for a defender to deliberately concede a rushed behind when he is not under any pressure from the attacking team. In the event that a defender does this, the umpire awards a free kick to the attacking team on the goal-line at the spot where the defender conceded the score. The defender may still deliberately concede a rushed behind if he is under pressure from an attacker. Two high- profile incidents during the 2008 AFL season were largely responsible for the introduction of this rule. In Round 16, Richmond's Joel Bowden rushed two behinds in a row while kicking in to use up time towards the end of their game against Essendon, reducing the margin from 6 points to 4 points, but enabling Richmond to win the game.Cooper, Adam and Clark, Laine; Bowden raised anomaly: Lions coach; 21 July 2008 Then the 2008 AFL Grand Final saw Hawthorn rush a record 11 behinds against Geelong.FootyStats Rushby HindsConnolly, Rohan; 11 rushed behinds: rule change needed; 29 September 2008 Prior to the 2008 season, a variation had already been trialled in pre-season matches in which a deliberate rushed behind conceded three points instead of one; this was never introduced into premiership matches.

The 2006/07 season was Mozaffarizadeh's first year refereeing in Iran's top division and it was one of the greatest years a rookie referee could have. Mozafarizadeh called 18 matches in which he gave away 71 cards and called 4 penalties. Out of all of his 18 matches the game of week 6 between Persepolis and Saipa was his worst game of the season but overall Saeid Mozaffarizadeh had so much talent that he was named Referee of the 2006/07 IPL season by the Football Iran News & Events which was given this referee award for the first time. During the 2007/08 season Mozaffarizadeh refereed 18 matches again but this time he gave a record setting 84 cards and he called only 2 penalties. Mozaffarizadeh did so well that they named him the referee for the Persepolis vs Sepahan match in the last week which proved who the champion of the league was. He was also the referee for the Hazfi Cup Final played between Pegah and Esteghlal. At the end of the season Mozaffarizadeh was once again named the referee of the season by Football Iran News & Events but he also won the same award by the Iran Football Federation Award which was being given for the first time. During the 2008/09 season Mozaffarizadeh officiated twice in the 2009 AFC Cup and he also refereed 17 matches in the league in which he gave 83 cards and called 9 penalties.

Fernando Torres is the chosen portrait. You Are The Ref is a British comic strip which has run in various publications since 1957, featuring a series of improbable hypothetical football scenarios that then invites the reader to make the refereeing decision. Created by sports artist Paul Trevillion, also famous for Roy of the Rovers, the strip features contributions from several top referees, and was collected into an official book in 2006. From 2006 to 2016 it featured online on theguardian.com. and in The Observer newspaper.  Publication history  The evolution of the strip began in 1952 in the Tottenham Hotspur magazine The Lillywhite, which featured a cartoon quiz by Paul Trevillion. The quiz included one question per issue on refereeing. Five years later, The People newspaper signed Trevillion to produce a dedicated refereeing cartoon quiz, and gave it the title Hey Ref. In the 1960s, the strip began appearing in a much larger format alongside Trevillion's work for Roy of the Rovers in official Roy annuals, under the title If You Were The Ref. But it was in 1969 that the strip took on its famous name, when it moved to be part of newly launched children's football magazine Shoot. The strip continued to run until 1983. Trevillion returned to You Are The Ref in 2006, producing new artwork for the strip for the first time in over 20 years, which was published in The Observer newspaper. Later that year, a book was published collecting the history of the strip. In 2008, You Are The Ref also appeared on the BBC's Euro 2008 blog, and on the website of The Guardian. In its most recent incarnation it relied on reader submissions for the three questions posed each week. As well as the illustrated questions, each strip includes a portrait of a well- known footballing person. New full colour feature strips were produced for The Observer until 2016 and a new \\"You Are The Ref\\" book was published by Octopus Books in October 2018. In June 2010, in advance of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, You Are The Ref was released as an iPhone / iPod Touch game developed by game developer Four Door Lemon. You Are The Ref: iPhone / iPod Touch game.  Referees  When the strip moved to Shoot in 1969, leading referee Stan Lover, head of the London referees' association, was taken on to provide the answers to the questions You Are The Ref posed each week. In subsequent years, Lover was replaced by Clive Thomas, and then by Keith Hackett, who provided the answers in The Observer strips.  You Are The Umpire  A cricketing equivalent, You Are The Umpire, also drawn by Trevillion, took You Are The Refs place in The Observer during football off-seasons from 2007 to 2016.

He is the nephew of New South Wales magistrate Pat O'Shane, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner Terry O'Shane. O'Shane's given name comes from the Aboriginal resistance fighter Tjandamurra, and is sometimes transliterated as 'Jandamurra'. The attack, and O'Shane's struggle to survive, captivated the Australian nation, as millions followed his plight in the Australian media. The attack The perpetrator, Paul Wade Streeton, arrived at the school carrying a 5-litre can of petrol, and never revealed why he chose to attack O'Shane out of the group of children in the playground. Streeton drenched O'Shane in fuel, and set him alight with a cigarette lighter. O'Shane ran through the school yard with his body in flames. Hearing O'Shane's screams, school principal Michael Aitken rushed out of his office and proceeded to smother the flames with his shirt and hands. With burns to 70 percent of his body, O'Shane was not expected to live. He required long periods recovering at the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane, and years of skin grafts. As most of his sweat glands were destroyed by the fire he can only sweat through his face and hands, making it difficult to play sport. Aftermath He became a national figure in Australia, as the country sympathised and followed his progress. The attack received publicity around the world. Streeton was arrested and later convicted for the attack. He was sentenced to life in jail. O'Shane and his mother Jenni Patterson say they have forgiven Streeton. Pat O'Shane described Streeton's sentence as \\"too harsh\\". Support In 1996, boxer Lionel Rose presented O'Shane with his World Title belt, hoping to speed the youngster's recovery. Fundraising activities took place around Australia. The current affairs program Witness, on the Seven Network, set up an appeal, and was inundated with money, chocolates, teddy bears and toys for O'Shane. The program raised in excess of $120,000, and money kept coming during following years. Australian rock band Midnight Oil played a charity concert in Townsville, Queensland in 1997, to raise money for O'Shane's recovery. In June 1999, at the age of eight, O'Shane was awarded A$75,000 in criminal compensation in the Supreme Court of Queensland.AAP General News Retrieved on 2008-08-19 Some commentators, including New South Wales Attorney-General Jeff Shaw, used the case to highlight inequities in the compensation laws, pointing out other cases where no physical harm was done, but much larger sums of money were issued. Graham Richardson of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, gave O'Shane a position on the Torch Relay of the 2000 Summer Olympics. As he was three years below the minimum age to carry the flame, O'Shane ran with his mother. In an interview given to The Courier Mail in 2008 to mark his 18th birthday, O'Shane said he was bemused by the enormous amount of national attention he had received in Australia. \\"Yeah, it's a bit strange,\\" he said. \\"Sometimes I forget that all of Australia knows what happened. People still want to know how I'm going.\\" In 2008 O'Shane graduated from Woree State High School after completing Year 12.

Dugway Brook is one of the six greater \\"bluestone brooks\\" of Cuyahoga County, also including Dean Brook, Euclid Creek, Nine-Mile Creek, Pepper Creek, Mill Creek and Doan Brook,Larick, Dr. Roy, \\"The Bluestone Brooks: Heart of the Eastern Inner Ring Landscape - A Natural and Historical Exploration,\\" , retrieved on August 16, 2008. and their watersheds which feed Lake Erie. All of the bluestone brooks, including Dugway Brook, are located in Bluestone Heights, a unique terrain area in Northeast Ohio's place between Appalachian Highlands and Central Lowlands. At the Bluestone Heights geographic center, Lyman Circle in Shaker Heights, is the singular source point for the six greater bluestone brooks. History Along with the other bluestone brooks, the east and west branches of Dugway Brook were formed about 14,000 years agoLarick, Dr. Roy, \\"The Bluestone Brooks: Heart of the Eastern Inner Ring Landscape - A Natural and Historical Exploration,\\" , retrieved on August 16, 2008. during the last glacial period, near the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. Both branches rose on or near the campus of John Carroll University in southeastern University Heights, descending and meandering roughly parallel in a northwesterly direction, then passing through Cleveland Heights, East Cleveland, and the City of Cleveland, where the two branches merge at a point just south of what is now Interstate 90. Dugway Brook then cuts northerly through the shoreline suburb of Bratenahl as a single watercourse, and finally discharges into Lake Erie.Beach, David, \\"Dugway Brook,\\" (June 13, 2007), retrieved on August 16, 2008. Dugway Brook is now an almost entirely enclosed culverted watercourse,Beach, David, \\"Dugway Brook,\\" (June 13, 2007), retrieved on August 16, 2008. running in its natural channel under and alongside streets and city parks built around it. The brook appears to have been culverted early in the 20th century, partly because of the nuisance of septic contamination to nearby residents. This contamination became a concern of the Ohio State Board of Health, which in 1914 ordered the City of Cleveland to improve the sewer system involved by 1916, before the upstream suburbs experienced dense development.State of Ohio, \\"Executive Documents: Annual Reports for 1914 Made to the Eighty-First General Assembly, Regular Session of the State of Ohio, Part III,\\" , retrieved on August 16, 2008. Culverting also maximized the development potential of surrounding land. About 94% of the watershed is now developed, with mostly mid-density housing. Approximately 45% of the watershed is in Cleveland Heights with 13% in University Heights, while less than 5% involves Bratenahl, Shaker Heights and South Euclid combined. A portion of Dugway Brook's content is overflow from sanitary sewer lines and illicit discharge. The City of Cleveland Heights has taken steps to keep the watershed's infrastructure clean and to reduce illicit discharge. West branch Meadowbrook Boulevard in University Heights and Cleveland Heights follows the winding course of the upper west branch, having been built on top of its culvert at the bottom of the stream valley. The west branch of Dugway Brook passes through Cleveland Heights as an open channel at several points within a mile south of and inside historic Lake View Cemetery, founded in 1869. The cemetery quarried Euclid bluestone, a desirable, dense, finely grained and easily cut variety of sandstone, from the part of the brook situated in Cleveland Heights. Bluestone from the cemetery quarry was used to construct buildings in the cemetery, a massive wall on the western (Mayfield Road) side of the cemetery, steps leading to the tops of small hills, and other structures. Quarrymen worked with picks, iron bars, and other hand tools, and used dynamite. Little stone was wasted; at least during part of the twentieth century, a stone crusher, positioned on a basal layer of stone flooring the quarry, was used to crush scraps to be used as foundations for cemetery monuments. The quarry here was active until the mid-1930s.Hannibal, J. T., Scherzer, B. A., and Saja, D.

In 1975, trustees of Lake View Cemetery sued the cities of University Heights and Cleveland Heights to stop their sewer expansions upstream to the south, anticipating worsening of the flooding of the west branch caused by heavy rains.Morton, Marian, Cleveland‚Äôs Lake View Cemetery, Arcadia Publishing (2004), pp. 90-91.

Passengers are carried in normal passenger carriages or in sleeping carriages on longer journeys, while the cars are loaded into autoracks, car-carriers, or flatcars that normally form part of the same train. Motorail services are not the same as car shuttle trains or car- carrying train services. The latter usually operate over relatively short distances, on lines passing through a rail tunnel and connecting two places not easily accessible to each other by road. On car shuttle train services, unlike on motorail services, the occupants of the road vehicles being carried on the train usually stay with their vehicle throughout the rail journey.  Examples   Europe  In Europe, many motorail connections are running cross-border between different European countries. To be mentioned are trains between Austria‚ÄîGermany, Austria‚ÄîItaly, Germany‚ÄîItaly, Czech Republic‚ÄîSlovakia and Serbia‚ÄîMontenegro. Some domestic services exist as well. Domestic motorail trains are running within Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Finland and France.

One of them (Euro-Express) stepped out of the market in late 2017, leaving three motorail operators addressing the German market: √ñBB, BTE and train4you. Austrian railway (√ñBB) took over most motorail services from DB Autozug. √ñBB now (December 2018) offers daily or almost daily motorail connections (under the brand name √ñBB nightjet) running from Germany to Austria. There are daily EuroNight overnight motorail trains from Vienna to Hamburg. In addition, similar services are offered from D√ºsseldorf to Innsbruck since December 2016. Another motorail service abandoned by DB Autozug was taken over by BTE, a German rail tourism company, which is affiliated with the US-based Railroad Development Corporation (RDC). BTE took over the DB Autozug connection between Hamburg and L√∂rrach, offering all-year- round motorail services 1-4 times a week.

In France, the SNCF's Auto/train servicewebsite comprises several overnight automobile-carrying trains throughout France. In the past, all of the Auto/trains also carried sleeping cars. Nowadays passengers travel on a separate train to their automobiles. Typically, passengers drop off their car any time during the day and then use a separate train to reach their destination, where they can pick up the car any time the following day. This service is available between 13 railway stations: the Gare de Bercy in Paris is the main auto-train terminal. There are also terminals in the stations of Avignon (separate station), Biarritz, Bordeaux, Brian√ßon, Brive, Fr√©jus-St-Rapha√´l (separate station), Lyon-Perrache, Marseille-Saint- Charles, Nice, Narbonne (separate station), Toulon, and Toulouse.Guide auto- train 2008 The automobiles are carried in open railcars. Other services are offered to the Auto Train service : a jockey to pick your car up at home, complementary insurances, free bus to leave the arrival station (Bercy, Avignon, Fr√©jus...), free parking... Since 2012, connections between other cities than Paris have been created, for instance, Bordeaux-Biarritz or Bordeaux-Nice. = Poland = In the early 1980s PKP offered motorail services between the following stations: Szczecin DƒÖbie, Trzebiat√≥w, Gdynia G≈Ç√≥wna, Warszawa G≈Ç√≥wna, Pozna≈Ñ G≈Ç√≥wny, Katowice, Krak√≥w G≈Ç√≥wny, and Zakopane. Services ran overnight and passengers were carried in sleeping cars and couchettes. By the end of the 1990s PKP operated only a single motorail service on overnight trains between Gdynia and Zakopane. The service never gained essential popularity and ultimately was withdrawn in 2004. Among many factors which led to closure of this service, it was criticised for being too cumbersome: while in Zakopane the passengers' cars were available almost immediately, it took nearly two hours to load or unload cars in Gdynia. = Serbia = There is a Motorail service in Serbia along the following routes: Belgrade - Bar (throughout the year), Novi Sad - Bar (summer season only) and Belgrade - Thessaloniki (summer season only).http://www.srbvoz.rs/eng/page13.html = Switzerland = In Switzerland, several car shuttle trains run, called Autoverlad; no motorail services exist. = United Kingdom = British Rail operated Motorail services from 1955 serving various destination, but had discontinued them by the time the state-owned body was wound up in the mid-1990s. The privatised train operator First Great Western went on to revive the service between London and Penzance in 1998, operating it until September 2005. Although not a Motorail service, the car shuttle train, Eurotunnel Shuttle operates a service between Coquelles (near Calais) in Hauts-de-France, France and Cheriton (near Folkestone) in Kent, United Kingdom. It conveys road vehicles (including bicycles and motorcycles) and passengers (including some animals) by rail through the Channel Tunnel. Freight vehicles are carried in separate shuttle trains hauled by the same locomotives.  Asia and Australia  = Australia = Great Southern Rail provides a Motorail service on its long- distance Indian Pacific, between Adelaide and Perth, The Ghan, between Adelaide and Darwin, and formerly offered Motorail on The Overland services. Traveltrain in Queensland formerly offered a Motorail service on its Sunlander and Spirit of the Outback trains. The Victorian Railways formerly offered Motorail on The Vinelander, and Sunraysia services on the Mildura line. The New South Wales Railways (later the Public Transport Commission) once offered Motorail services on its long-distance lines. = Japan = A Japanese \\"car train\\" in Nagoya in 1988. Several overnight \\"car train\\" („Ç´„Éº„Éà„É¨„Ç§„É≥) services were operated by the Japanese National Railways and its successor JR Group between 1985 and 1999. The first such service operated between Shiodome Freight Terminal in Tokyo and Higashi-Kokura Freight Terminal in northern Kyushu. At various times during the 1990s, similar services were operated between Nagoya and Kyushu, between Tokyo and Hokkaido through the Seikan Tunnel, and within Hokkaido. The freight terminal at Ebisu Station was used as a terminal for car train services prior to its closure for redevelopment as the Ebisu Garden Place complex, at which point such services were moved to Hamamatsucho Station. There were a number of problems with these services which contributed to their eventual cancellation, including fairly severe size restrictions on the vehicles that could be transported, lack of on-board dining facilities, revenue sharing issues between regional operating companies following the privatization of JR, and competition with both long-distance car ferries and combination air/rental car travel products.  North- and South-America  = Canada = The Ontario Northland Railway's Polar Bear Express has several flatcars that carry vehicles from Cochrane to Moosonee. Snowmobiles and ATVs are carried in boxcars. CN Rail operated the Car-Go Rail in the 1960s, but closed the service a few years after. = Chile = In Chile, EFE (Empresa de los Ferrocarriles del Estado) operates a service called \\"Autotren\\"website between Santiago and Temuco. = United States = Amtrak operates their dedicated Auto Train between Lorton, Virginia (near Washington, D.C.) and Sanford, Florida (near Orlando), a distance of . = Argentina = In Argentina, the transportation of cars by train was very popular for many years,but after the rationalization of passenger services in the 1990s,most of the motorail services were canceled. Currently the only train that offers this service is the Tren Patagonico (Patagonian Train), which connects Viedma on the Atlantic coast with Bariloche in the Andes covering a distance of 800 km.

He was probably of purely Pictish origin, though the Aberdeen Breviary (1509) says he was born in Ireland. The legend in the Breviary states that he was raised to the episcopate by Pope Gregory; and Adam King's Kalendar (1558) styles him \\"bischop and confess. in Scotland under King Solvathius\\". The Bollandists, following the chronology of the Dalriadic kings as adopted by Pinkerton and Skene, place the reign of Selvach from 706 to 726; and, as Gregory II was pope from 715 to 731, conclude that Talarican became bishop about 720, a few years after the Columban monks of Iona had been induced by St. Egbert to conform to the Roman Rite. He is said to have offered the Holy Sacrifice every day, to have been noted for his zeal and his mortified life, and to have converted many pagans in the northern coasts of Scotland through his preaching and example. According to Dempster, he died in the island of Lismore. He is considered a Catholic and Eastern Orthodox saint, and many churches subsequently founded in the Dioceses of Moray, Ross, and Aberdeen were dedicated in his honour. His name is perpetuated in the district of Kiltarlity (Inverness-shire), the church and cemetery of Ceilltarraglan (Skye), and wells still known as \\"St. Tarkin's\\" at Fordyce, Kilsyth, and elsewhere.

He was the first European to set anchor in what is now called Table Bay, South Africa, and made the first recorded ascent of Table Mountain.Mary Gunn, L. e. Codd, L. E. W. Codd. Botanical Exploration of Southern Africa: An Illustrated History of Early Botanical Literature on the Cape Flora : Biographical Accounts of the Leading Plant Collectors and Their Activities in Southern Africa from the Days of the East India Company Until Modern Times. CRC Press, 1981. p5-7.  Background  Chroniclers Gaspar Correia (p. 412) and Fern√£o Lopes de Castanheda (p. 157) identify Ant√≥nio de Saldanha as a \\"Castilian nobleman\\" who arrived in Portugal around 1497, in the household service of the queen Maria of Aragon. His original Castilian name is unknown, 'Saldanha' possibly referring to the Castilian town of Salda√±a, which may have been his place of origin.  Expedition of 1503  Being a man of \\"some nautical experience\\", Saldanha was appointed to head a squad of three vessels, part of Afonso de Albuquerque's fleet bound for India to reinforce the Portuguese settlement at Cochin.Wolfgang Haase, Meyer Reinhold. The Classical Tradition and the Americas: European Images of the Americas and the Classical Tradition, Part 1. Walter de Gruyter, 1994. p62. Although accompanying the India fleet, Saldanha's squad was said to have been given separate instructions to patrol the mouth of the Red Sea, and prey on Arab shipping. Saldanha's three-ship squad (himself, Rui Louren√ßo Ravasco and Diogo Fernandes Pereira) set out of Lisbon in early May 1503, intending to catch up with Albuquerque's main fleet, which had gone on ahead. Poor pilotage, however, led to numerous errors. The squad mistakenly sailed into the Gulf of Guinea, Saldanha and Louren√ßo alighting near S√£o Tom√©, with no idea where their third ship might be (Diogo Fernandes was actually on the proper track, sailing on alone). The remaining two began to make their way painfully south along the African coast, against the contrary winds and currents. Somewhere along the way, Saldanha and Louren√ßo lost sight of each other as well. Cape Town: Table Bay (left), Cape Point peninsula (right) and False Bay (behind) Again, by poor piloting, Saldanha miscalculated his Cape crossing, and ended up making landfall just north of the Cape of Good Hope. To check if the cape had been surpassed, Saldanha anchored in the hitherto unknown Table Bay, and went ashore.Theal (1902: 163) Saldanha thus became the first European to set foot in what was to become modern Cape Town. Saldanha climbed the flat-topped mountain adjacent to the bay and identified the tip of the Cape (Cape Point) further to the south. He named the peak Table Mountain and (legend has it that he and his men) carved a cross in the rock of a nearby formation, traces of which can still be found on Lion's Head today.History of Cape Town, www.Cape-town.info, retrieved August 16, 2008 Saldanha replenished his water supplies at a local watering hole (he also got into a brief skirmish with local Khoikhoi and was slightly wounded), before returning to his ship. Table Bay was promptly named Aguada de Saldanha (Saldanha's watering stop) by Portuguese 16th-century cartographers. In 1601 a Dutch seafarer and cartographer, Joris van Spilbergen identified a bay further to the north of the Cape as Aguada de Saldanha. Henceforth this location became known as Saldanha Bay and the place where Saldanha anchored was renamed Table Bay. Events from here are a bit obscure. It seems after multiple attempts, Saldanha finally doubled the cape, but his ship was in sufficiently poor shape to force him to put into Mossel Bay for repair. A note left at that watering hole says he was still there in October, 1503. During this interlude, Rui Louren√ßo Ravasco was actually waiting for him in Mozambique Island. With no sign of Saldanha, Louren√ßo entertained himself with some freelance piracy on the East African coast, capturing ships off Kilwa and reducing Zanzibar and Barawa to tribute, and battling against Mombassa (who were besieging the Portuguese-allied Malindi). Diogo Fernandes, with still no idea where the others were, was waiting patiently in the mouth of the Red Sea by himself. Saldanha finally left South Africa and caught up with Louren√ßo Ravasco at Malindi. They proceeded together to force a treaty on Mombassa, before heading up to the Red Sea. Saldanha and Louren√ßo Ravasco spent the winter of 1503-04 around Cape Guardafui, capturing numerous Arab merchant ships. They were completely ignorant that Diogo Fernandes was just nearby, quietly wintering by himself at the island of Socotra. In the Spring of 1504, entrusting much of their stolen treasures to the safekeeping of the King of Malindi, Saldanha and Louren√ßo Ravasco sailed across the Indian Ocean to India. But badly battered, they were forced to stop for a long period of repairs and rest at Anjediva island, apparently unaware that, at the very moment, a desperate battle was being fought at Cochin, between the small Portuguese garrison and the large army of the Zamorin of Calicut. In September, 1504, Saldanha and Louren√ßo Ravasco were found by 6th India Armada, under the command of Lopo Soares de Albergaria, who helped them finish their repairs, annexed them into his fleet and proceeded down to Cochin. Saldanha participated in several actions in India in late 1504, notably the razing of Cranganore in October. In January, 1505, Saldanha joined the return fleet back to Lisbon. The fleet stopped by Malindi to pick up his deposited treasure and arrived in Lisbon in July.  Passenger in 1506  According to Jo√£o de Barros, Ant√≥nio de Saldanha returned to the Indian Ocean in 1506, with the 8th Armada under Trist√£o da Cunha, albeit not as a captain of his own ship. He came principally as a navigator, to help guide the Red Sea-bound squad of Afonso de Albuquerque around Cape Guardafui.Barros, vol.3, p.2, p.17 In late 1506/early 1507, when the fleet was lingering in Mozambique Island waiting for favorable winds, the admiral Trist√£o da Cunha placed his own flagship, the Sant' Iago, under the temporary command of Saldanha, while he went off on some exploratory expeditions on the African coast in a smaller boat.Barros, p.8 Cunha soon came across the Flor de la Mar, the ship of Jo√£o da Nova, who, on the return from India the previous year, had sprung a bad leak and been forced to stop for repairs. The spice cargo was transferred to another ship (unnamed) and placed under the command of Antonio de Saldanha, with instructions to sail it safely back to Lisbon.Barros, p.18. Danvers (p.152) mistakenly says Saldanha brought back the Flor de la Mar back to Lisbon. But Barros (p., 18, p.392) clearly notes the Flor stayed with Nova; it was an unnamed cargo ship, carrying the Flor's cargo, that Saldanha returned. It is said that Saldanha did stop by Saldanha Bay (the modern one, not Table Bay) on the return journey.Danvers, p.152  Captain of Sofala-Mozambique (1509)  In 1509, Ant√≥nio de Saldanha was appointed for a three-year term as captain-major of Sofala and Mozambique Island (East Africa), succeeding the late Vasco Gomes de Abreu. He set out in the Spring of 1509 as a passenger with the 11th Armada under D. Fernando Coutinho, and was deposited at Mozambique Island in August, and took .Barros (Dec II, Lib 3, c.9; vol. 3, p.331); Theal,190: p.200 During his tenure there, Saldanha helped oversee the dismantling of the Portuguese fort at Kilwa (Quiloa) in 1511. In 1512, his term in Sofala-Mozambique finished, Ant√≥nio de Saldanha was relieved by the new governor Sim√£o de Miranda de Azevedo, who arrived in October. Saldanha took charge of Miranda's ship for the return to Lisbon.

The film was written by Travers and director James Hill, and has been released to VHS and DVD. Plot and cast The film begins with Travers and McKenna leaving their home in England to caretake a house in Africa belonging to a friend scheduled for lengthy medical treatments in Switzerland. Arriving in Nairobi, they are met by Mr. Mophagee (Vinay Inambar) who has arranged transport for the couple - an old Land Rover Series 2 which becomes something of a character in the film. After buying food supplies in a local market, the couple traverse a wilderness populated by a variety of wildlife‚Äîwildebeest, zebra, giraffe, ostrich, and crocodile‚Äîto their friend's house 150 miles distant from Nairobi. There, they cope with the house's primitive amenities including a kitchen in a truck, not to mention their temperamental Land Rover which seems to have a mind of its own. One morning, the couple rise to find three young elephants lumbering about the grounds and wreaking havoc \\"like juvenile delinquents\\". The couple name the two largest elephants Kadengi and Jaspar, and the smallest one pole pole (Swahili for \\"Slowly Slowly\\"). The couple visit Game Wardens George Adamson and Charles Mutiso (Ali Twaha) who suggest the couple have been \\"adopted\\" by the three elephants and recommend they make friends. At home, pole pole has moved in and made herself comfortable; the couple create a wallow on the grounds for her, travel to the river for a swim, and take evening walks with her. When their house-sitting duty comes to a close, Travers and McKenna are confident the three elephants will join a herd in the vicinity. Cast includes Joab Collins as Henry, and Raffles Harman.

It is the location of the Daniels Mill, a site listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Daniels is the home town of former Howard County Executive and State Senator James N. Robey. A postal office operated in the community from 1 March 1943 to 31 August 1971. History The original settlement that would become the town of Daniels formed in 1810, when the family of Thomas Ely came to the area and built a textile mill. The community around the mill was known as Elysville. In 1853, the town was purchased by the family of James S. Gary and renamed to Alberton in honor of James' son Albert. The factory remained with the Gary family until 1940, when the Daniels Company bought the town and changed its name to Daniels. The Saint Stanislaus Kostka Catholic Church was struck by lightning and burnt down on September 24, 1927. An ancient family ring valued at over $100,000 was lost in the fire and never recovered.

Irving, 481 U.S. 704 (1987), is a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that a statute ordering the escheat of fractional interests in real property which had been bequeathed to members of the Oglala Sioux tribe was an unconstitutional taking which required just compensation.. Background Towards the end of the 19th century, Congress enacted a series of land Acts which divided the communal reservations of Indian tribes into individual allotments for Indians and unallotted lands for non-Indian settlement. This legislation was motivated both by a desire to force Indians to abandon their nomadic ways in order to \\"speed the Indians' assimilation into American society\\",481 U.S. at 706. and by pressure to free new lands for further white settlement. One of these statutes, enacted in 1889, allotted each male Sioux head of household took of land and most other individuals , with the land to be held in trust by the United States. Prior to 1910, the lands of deceased allottees passed to their heirs \\"according to the laws of the State or Territory\\" where the land was located. After 1910, allottees were permitted to dispose of their interests by will in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior, which were intended to protect Native American ownership of the allotted lands. Unfortunately, this policy of promoting private ownership of land among the Sioux had disastrous consequences. Instead of working the land themselves, the Sioux sold, or more frequently leased, the lands to whites, and lived off the meager revenues. Worse yet, each successive generation found their parcels became splintered into multiple undivided interests in land, with many parcels having dozens (and in some cases, hundreds) of owners. Because the land was held in trust and often could not be alienated or partitioned, the fractionation problem grew steadily worse over time. Financial returns from the leased lands were divided up among so many parties that the holders of the fractionated interests would get as little as one cent from their holdings, and the administrative costs of bookkeeping and monitoring all of the fractional interests was economically unfeasible. Congress ended the practice of land allotment in 1934, but this did little to alleviate the ownership problems which already existed, and continued to get worse with each passing generation of Sioux. In hopes of finally solving the fractionation problem, Congress passed the Indian Land Consolidation Act in 1983.The modern version of the Indian Land Consolidation Act is currently codified at Title 25, Chapter 24, U.S. Code Section 207 of the act provided that: > No undivided fractional interest in any tract of trust or restricted land > within a tribe's reservation or otherwise subjected to a tribe's > jurisdiction shall descedent [sic] by intestacy or devise but shall escheat > to that tribe if such interest represents 2 per centum or less of the total > acreage in such tract and has earned to its owner less than $100 in the > preceding year before it is due to escheat. The statute did not make any provisions for the payment of compensation to the holders of the fractional interests which were to escheat to the tribe. Facts and procedural history The plaintiffs in this case were three enrolled members of the Oglala Sioux tribe: Mary Irving, Patrick Pumpkin Seed, and Eileen Bissonette. All of them were heirs or devisees of deceased tribe members. Irving lost two escheatable interests worth approximately $100, Pumpkin Seed lost 13 escheatable interests worth $1,816, and Bissonette lost $2,700 on the 26 escheatable interests in she was devised. The plaintiffs filed suit against Donald P. Hodel, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Interior, in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota. The District Court found for the government, holding that the plaintiffs had no vested interest in the property of the decedents prior to their deaths, and that Congress had plenary authority to abolish the power of testamentary disposition of Indian property and to alter the rules of intestate succession, and concluded that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statute violated the plaintiff's rights under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. While the Eighth Circuit agreed with the District Court that the plaintiffs did not have vested rights in the decedents' property, it concluded that their decedents had a right, derived from the original Sioux allotment statute, to control disposition of their property at death. The government sought certiorari, which was granted. Decision Majority opinion Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority, first held that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the statute. Even though they were not asserting their own property rights, the fact that their decedents had been denied the right to devise their property by will or intestacy created a sufficient injury-in- fact for the plaintiffs to bring suit. She then moved on to the substantive issue of the case. O'Connor agreed with the government that the fractionation of ownership was a serious problem, which Congress did have the power to ameliorate. She also agreed that the Sioux probably lost no \\"investment-backed expectations\\" under the test set forth in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978). However, she held that the right to will one‚Äôs property to one's heirs is one of the most important \\"sticks in the bundle\\" under Anglo-American common law, and that the total abrogation of this right constitutes a taking. Concurring opinions Justice Brennan and Justice Scalia each wrote a brief, single-paragraph concurring opinion, both of which analogized the rights lost by the plaintiffs in this case to those lost under the Eagle feather law. Justice Stevens concurred in the judgment, and wrote the longest concurrence. His chief objection to the statute is that it afforded no opportunity for the plaintiffs' decedents to avoid escheat by consolidating their property through voluntary inter vivos transfers (for example, by providing a grace period before the statute came into force), thus violating their due process rights.

History  In 1924 the Waggonfabrik Fuchs coach factory in Heidelberg converted four Bavarian MCCi steam railbuses into Class ET 85 electric railbuses with running numbers 01‚Äì04. After this conversion an order for 32 new vehicles of this type was delivered to Fuchs and BBC to be built from 1927 to 1933. In 1927 it was still not possible to locate the entire electric engine unter the coach floor. The transformer and the switching (Schaltwerk) was therefore installed in an engine compartment. The nine railbuses were only a little longer than their \\"prototypes\\". The doors to the passenger section were recessed like those of their predecessors, however there was only a single door to the engine compartment on the right hand side of the vehicle. All units up to number ET 85 30 originally had front doors and gangways that were later removed. In identical form and with the same internal layout - instead of the engine room, there was a luggage compartment - driving cars ES 85 01‚Äì34 appeared from 1927 to 1933. Rebuilt six-wheeled Bavarian passenger coaches, numbers EB 85 01‚Äì70, acted as trailer cars; they were later replaced by six-wheeled 'rebuild coaches', the so-called Umbau-Wagen. Motor coaches ET 85 05 and 09 were equipped for top speeds of 100 km/h. The DB took over the Class ET 85 and reclassified them in 1968 as DB Class 485/885. These vehicles were not just employed in Munich suburban services but also by the Deutsche Bundesbahn in the Black Forest on the Three Lakes Railway and the Wehra Valley Line. By 1977 all the vehicles had been retired; the last ones being nos. 485 005 + 885 615. In 1949 numbers ET 85 13, 14 and 16 were converted to ET 90 01‚Äì03. After re- motoring they were used on the inclined route from Berchtesgaden to K√∂nigssee and occasionally also on the Ammer Valley Railway. In 1972 the ET 90s were retired.

Early career  Jarrett was born in Newport, Monmouthshire,Newport RFC player profiles the son of former Glamorgan cricketer Hal Jarrett, and attended Monmouth School. Like his father he also played cricket for Glamorgan County Cricket Club. In 1966 Keith Jarrett played rugby union for Newport against Ebbw Vale, shortly after leaving school.  Cricket  Jarrett played for Glamorgan Second XI from 1965 to 1967, appearing in two first-class matches in 1967 ‚Äì one each against the Indian and Pakistani tourists. He was a middle order bat and change right arm seam bowler.  International rugby career  Jarrett played his first international for Wales on 15 April 1967 against England, aged eighteen years. He had been selected at full back even though he had never played senior rugby in that position. Newport were asked to play him at full back against Newbridge on the weekend before the international to give him some experience. He did not seem to be much of a success in his new position and at half time, his captain David Watkins, switched him to centre. The following week Jarrett played in his first international and scored a breathtaking try. England won a line-out in their own 25 (as it was then). The ball was passed down the line to English centre, Colin McFadyean, who kicked towards the halfway line. The ball bounced once and was seemingly going in to touch. Instead, Jarret sprinted onto the ball, taking it without breaking stride. He sprinted down the touchline, outflanking the whole of the astonished England defence, to score in the left corner. He converted his own try from just inside the touchline. Besides scoring a try, he kicked two penalty goals and five conversions for a total of 19 points. His performance on the field was so impressive that the match has been known ever since as the Keith Jarrett match and he made the cover of Rugby World magazine two months later. The try has been voted seventh in a poll of the top ten Welsh tries and he is listed on the Welsh Rugby Union Official Website as the scorer of the \\"Greatest Ever Welsh try\\". In 1968 he set a club record of 30 points for Newport against Penarth, and was selected for the 1968 British Lions tour to South Africa. Jarrett played for Wales at rugby union ten times in all, making his final appearance against Australia on 21 June 1969 during the Wales tour of New Zealand and Australia. Later career On his return from tour in 1969, Jarrett joined rugby league club Barrow for a signing-on fee of ¬£14,000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£383,500 in 2016). He was also selected for the Welsh national rugby league side, before he had played his first match for Barrow. He was later transferred to Wigan, although he did not play from them.

History The first series (E16 01-10) was delivered in 1926, the second (E16 11-17) in 1927. The third, re-worked series (E16 18-21) was transferred to the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1932 and 1933.

With the introduction of the DB classification system on 1 January 1968, the remaining 18 Class E 16 engines were regrouped into Class 116.

Biography Diehl graduated from the Institut d'Art et d'Arch√©ologie in 1934 and the Ecole du Louvre in 1936. In October 1935, Diel and his classmates formed a student group called 'Regain', where they conducted a weekly review of the same name dedicated to discuss once or twice a month of contemporary creativity with different artists in the basement of the Capoulade Quartier. Beginning 1938, Diehl participated in the weekly magazine Marianne and kept for a year a chronicle of art called \\"The rostrum of Youth.\\" In 1939, he founded the magazine Charpentes. In October 1943, during the Nazi Occupation, Diehl founded the May Salon in Paris in a caf√© on the Palais Royal, in opposition to the ideology of Nazism and its condemnation of degenerate art. Its other founder-members were Henri-Georges Adam, Emmanuel Auricoste, Lucien Coutaud, Robert Couturier, Jacques Despierre, Marcel Gili, Leon Gischia, Francis Gruber, Ren√© Ich√©, Jean Le Moal, Alfred Manessier, Andr√© Marchand, Edouard Pignon, Gustave Singier, Claude Venard and Roger Vieillard. Several of them (Coutaud, Gischia, Ich√©, Le Moal, Manessier, Marchand, Pignon, Singier) had in 1941 participated in the exhibition of Twenty young painters of French tradition. The first May Salon took place at the Galerie Pierre Maurs from 29 May to 29 June 1945. Diehl created in October 1944 the Movement of Friends of Art for the dissemination of the modern art through lectures, screenings, films, educational exhibitions particularly in the provinces. He was close to Rouault, and the young painters of French tradition which he prefaced exhibitions from 1943 at the Galerie de France. Diehl also helped with the exhibitions of Bonnard, Matisse, Picasso, Villon, Braque, Bernard Buffet and Hans Hartung, and thus, accordingly including the testimony of Pierre Restany that he \\"was very conscious writer who had a foot in the first half of his century and another in the second.\\" In 1948, Diehl played a role in the creation of the International Film Festival of Art and contributed to the films: Van Gogh (1948), which won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1950 and Gauguin (1950) with Alain Resnais and Christmas galantes (Watteau) (1950) with Jean Aurel. In September 1950, Diehl was appointed professor by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Venezuela at the Central University of Venezuela and the School of Fine Arts where he taught art history. As a cultural attache at the embassy, he also directed the Franco-Venezuelan Institute, and wrote articles in the press in Europe and Latin America. He helped artists like Carlos Cruz-Diez and Jes√∫s-Rafael Soto to gain recognition in Europe. From 1950 to 1966, Diehl played a similar role in Morocco following in the footsteps of Delacroix and Matisse. In February 1966, he directed the Bureau des Expositions de l'Action Artistique, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and took until his retirement in 1977 the task of start with the help of curators, critics and friends of exhibitions in France at the Grand and Petit Palais and the Louvre (including The Treasury Toutankamon in 1960). Diehl continued until his death to support art in all its forms and in the world and was elected President of the Museum of Latin America in 1983, and helped introduce Latin American artists at the House of Latin America in Monte Carlo from 1986 to 1998.

Vacchi also works as an announcer at the Swedish national football team's home matches, Vasaloppet, Royal Palace Sprint and other events. Biography Roberto Vacchi was born in Stockholm in 1965, to his two Italian parents who emigrated to Sweden in the 1950s. At the age of 9, his family moved back to Italy to La Spezia where he discovered competitive cycling. After a few years in Italy they moved back to Sweden. There he continued his career in cycling with Hammarby IF (1978-79), Sp√•rv√§gens GoIF (1980‚Äì1991) and in 1992 V√§ster√•s CK, where he ended his career, tired of the bad economic situation that came with competitive cycling at elite level. In 1993, whilst working for the Swedish Cycling Association, Eurosport approached Vacchi with an offer to commentate cycling on TV. In the beginning he did not comment much, but eventually it became a full-time job. He has credited Bengt Grive as his mentor during the first years at Eurosport.

Rammasun was also recognised as the third tropical storm, the second typhoon and the first super typhoon of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Rammasun formed on May 5 as a tropical disturbance. The next day the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the developing disturbance. On May 7 both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency designated the disturbance as a tropical depression, while PAGASA named the depression Butchoy. Later that day both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm with the JMA naming the storm Rammasun. On May 9 both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Rammasun to a typhoon. The next day the JMA and the JTWC reported that Rammasun had reached its peak winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and 250 km/h (155 mph) respectively, which made Rammasun a Category 4 super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After reaching its peak intensity, Rammasun weakened and was downgraded to severe tropical storm on May 12, before the JTWC declared it extratropical and issued their final advisory. The JMA did not issue their final advisory until several hours later. Within Japan an estimated 10 hectares (24.7 acres) of farmland were damaged. In all, the typhoon killed four people, injured 40 others and caused $9.6 million (2008 USD) worth of damage in both the Philippines and Japan. Meteorological history On May 4, 2008, an area of low pressure formed in the Pacific Ocean to the southeast of Yap. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the area of low pressure to a tropical disturbance and assessed the disturbances chances of forming into a significant tropical cyclone within 24 hours as poor. This was because the developing low level circulation center was weak. Early on May 6, the JTWC upgraded the disturbances chances of forming into a tropical cyclone within 24 hours to \\"fair\\", as the low level circulation center had consolidated further. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was then issued later that day, by the JTWC who upgraded the disturbance's chances of becoming a tropical cyclone by the next day as good. Early the next day both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the tropical disturbance as a tropical depression with PAGASA assigning the local name of Butchoy to the depression. At this time the depression was located 790 km, (490 miles), to the east of Mindanao in the Philippines. Later that morning the JMA started to issue full advisories on the tropical depression as forecasts showed that the depression could become a tropical storm within 24 hours. The JTWC then designated the depression as Tropical Depression 02W. Later that day both the JTWC and the JMA reported that the depression intensified into a tropical storm, with the JMA assigning the name Rammasun to the storm. Typhoon Rammasun near peak intensity on May 10 Rammasun continued to intensify and was designated as a severe tropical storm late on May 8. The next day both the JMA and the JTWC reported that Rammasun had intensified into a typhoon. Later that day the JTWC reported that the typhoon had rapidly intensified within the last six hours and had become a Category 3 typhoon on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. At the same time the JMA were reporting that Rammasun had winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). The typhoon then continued to intensify quickly with the JMA reporting that Rammasun had winds of 160 km/h (100 mph), the JTWC then reported that Rammasun had become a Category 4 typhoon with winds of 225 km/h (140 mph). Later that day both the JMA and the JTWC reported that the typhoon had reached its peak winds. The JMA reported peak winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) whilst the JTWC reported that Rammasun had peak winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), making it a category 4 super typhoon. Typhoon Rammasun's minimum pressure was officially estimated at 915 hPa which tied with Intense Tropical Cyclone Hondo as second strongest storm of 2008. The JTWC kept Rammasun as a super typhoon until early on May 11, when they reported that the typhoon had weakened into a category four typhoon, while the JMA were reporting that the typhoon had wind speeds of 175 km/h (110 mph). Later that day both agencies reported that the typhoon had weakened even further, with the JMA reporting that Rammasun had winds of 160 km/h (100 mph), while the JTWC reported that Rammasun had weakened into a Category 3 typhoon. The JTWC then reported within their next advisory that Rammasun had weakened into a Category 2 typhoon whilst the JMA reported that the typhoon had winds of 140 km/h (90 mph). The next day as the Typhoon moved out of PAGASA's area of responsibility Rammasun was downgraded to a Category 1 typhoon by the JTWC. Later that day the JMA downgraded Rammasun to a Severe Tropical Storm whilst the JTWC downgraded it to an extratropical cyclone and released their final advisory on the system. The JMA continued to issue advisories on severe tropical storm Rammasun until early the next day when they downgraded it to an extratropical low. Naming, preparations and impact The extratropical remnants of Rammasun passing by Japan on May 12. The name \\"Rammasun\\" was one of the 10 original names submitted by Thailand to the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee for use from January 1, 2000. Rammasun is the Thai god for thunder. The name was last used in the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, though it was retired in 2015 after Typhoon Rammasun (the same name used for the 2014 season, Typhoon Glenda in the Philippines) left considerable damages in the Philippines, China and Vietnam. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also assigned the local name of \\"Butchoy\\" to Rammasun; the name \\"Butchoy\\" was last used by PAGASA to name a tropical depression in the Philippines in 2004 to name Tropical Storm 02W. Within the Philippines, PAGASA issued no public storm warning signals, as the storm was too far away from the country to prompt the issuance of such advisories. However, they did warn that the cyclone was expected to enhance the southwest monsoon and bring rain over Central and Southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Philippines On May 12, a father of two drowned in rough seas produced by Rammasun after saving his children. Later that day, a boat carrying 17 people capsized due to rough seas produced by the typhoon. All of the passengers were rescued the following day by the Philippine Coast Guard. Heavy rains from the outer bands of Rammasun triggered flooding and mudslides in the Philippines. Strong winds also downed numerous trees, one of which, measured at in diameter, fell on three forest guards, killing two and critically injuring the other. In Jaro, Iloilo City, a swollen river overflowed its banks, inundating the district. Local reports stated that water in the area was waist-deep in places. In Cauayan, a 15-year-old girl drowned after being washed away while crossing a bridge. Flooding in Hinoba-an, Negros Occidental destroyed six homes and damaged 24 others. An estimated 3,153 families were affected by the storm in the Philippines. A strong extratropical storm from the \\"tail\\" of the former typhoon struck the Philippines after Rammasun had become extratropical. The associated winds caused severe damage to buildings, and numerous trees were uprooted. The damage may have been due to a possible tornado, although this possibility is not confirmed. At least 40 people were injured and damage totaled to PHP 61 million ($1.2 million USD). Japan On May 12, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued warnings for the Tokyo area as Rammasun was forecast to make landfall near the city. As Rammasun became extratropical, the storm brushed the Japanese coastline on May 13, producing winds gusting up to 85 km/h (50 mph) and high waves for several hours. An estimated 10 hectares (24.7 acres) of farmland were damaged. Damage from the storm amounted to ¬•770 million ($8.4 million 2008 USD) in agricultural losses.

He is presented as the adversary of God, possibly because of the real Diocletian's persecution of Christians. Legends attribute to him building of the town of Duklja, Dukljan's border, and the Roman milestones near Tuzi (according to a folktale, he was throwing them at his brother and sister as they were fleeing to Hum). A Serbian folk song about Dukljan says that he once removed the Sun from the sky and brought it to the Earth. Saint John managed to trick him and restore the Sun, but afterwards, while chasing him, Dukljan grabbed at him and tore a piece of flesh from John's foot, which explains why humans have arches of the foot. Several variants of a story that he is still alive exist; according to them he is chained in the Moraƒça river near Duklja (the Vizier's bridge). In some of them, he constantly gnaws at his chains, and each year around Christmas (or around ƒêurƒëevdan) nearly manages to break free and destroy the world, when four Gypsy blacksmiths reforge the chains.

The castle belonged to the Earls of Seaforth, chiefs of the Clan Mackenzie, who dominated the area. History Brahan Castle was built by Colin Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth in 1611. Kenneth Mackenzie, a labourer on the estate, was a reputed seer who made a number of prophecies in the later 17th century. He is remembered as the Brahan Seer. The Mackenzies were prominent Jacobites, and took part in the Jacobite risings of 1715, 1719 and 1745. The Siege of Brahan took place in November 1715.Mackenzie, Alexander. \\"History of the Munros of Fowlis\\". page 99 Published 1898. Quoting a contemporary manuscript written by Major Fraser of Castleleathers William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth, was attainted, forfeiting the estate, which in 1725 became the headquarters of General Wade during his \\"pacification\\" of the Highlands. After the later Jacobite rising of 1745, the Mackenzies were the first clan to surrender, being forced to swear allegiance to the British Crown on the steps of the castle. The estate was later sold back to the Mackenzie family, although the direct line of descent died out in 1781. The estate passed to Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth who carried out tree planting in the grounds. On his death in 1815, Brahan passed to the baron's eldest daughter Mary Elizabeth Frederica Mackenzie who married James Alexander Stewart of Glasserton in 1817.National Records of Scotland GD46/21/6 General Retour in Favour of Lady Hood Mackenzie as heir to her Father Francis, Lord Seaforth 7 March 1816 During the first half of the 19th century, the castle was rebuilt and extended as a large country house. James Stewart-Mackenzie was created Baron Seaforth in 1921, but on his death without heir in 1923, he left the estate to a trust. Brahan Castle was briefly requisitioned during World War II, and after the war its condition deteriorated. In the early 1950s the building was demolished, leaving only the north wall of the 19th century building, which served as a garden ornament. The stable block survives, and is now known as Brahan House. Several heraldic panels and other decorative stones are preserved in the house. A monument on the estate, around west of the site of the castle, commemorates the death in 1823 of Caroline Mackenzie, daughter of the last earl, who died after being thrown from a pony carriage near the same location.

In Hiligaynon, the term is nakaalwan. It comes from the blending of the Chinese concept of wo (peace and harmony), the Malay culture of familiarity even to distant relatives and other clan members, and the Christian teaching of helping the poor.  Background  There is a traditional Chinese belief that states that in order to have peace and harmony in a kingdom or empire, there should be no extremes in wealth and poverty. Thus, those who are wealthy should give some of their wealth to those living in destitution. Thus, the poor will not take arms and revolt against those living in opulence. With the introduction of Christian teachings by the Spanish missionaries starting in the 16th Century, the indigenous Filipino ethic was somehow refined to benevolence to all those in need, in general. The term and its variants have been incorporated in a number of Tagalog idioms and proverbs. Through the Spanish and the American colonial periods, and even the Japanese Occupation, as linguistic categorization emerges in the Filipino language as a representation of Filipino world view and causality, the concept of \\"nakaluluwag\\" further modified social perception and thereby leads to a continual interaction between the Filipino language and philosophy. In some Filipino artworks, those in need are pictured as tightly clinging to what they have, and come into grips. While those who are well-off are pictured as willing to let go of some of their possessions for those in need. \\"Maluwag\\" or \\"maluwang\\" literally means lightly held, loose, or spacious. It may also imply sufficient freedom to move around or having a comfortable space to work on. The term implies willingness in giving and helping: \\"maluwag sa kalooban\\" and those familiar with accounting concepts often substitute the term \\"liquid\\" as in \\"Liquid ka ba ngayon? Puede bang makahiram?\\" (\\"Are you liquid at this time? Can you lend me some amount?\\"). Even some Filipino grade school children form small informal cooperatives and do paluwagan which is essentially a group money lending scheme. However, the term magpaluwal has become synonymous with simple money lending, while the ethic nakaluluwag involves giving.  Academic interpretations of Nakaluluwag  This Filipino ethic of giving includes some sacrifice on the part of the giver: the person giving (nakaluluwag) should at the very least, feel some discomfort. One should \\"get hurt\\" by his or her act of giving. Otherwise the essence of sacrifice will be absent. This is similar but not identical to the Christian lesson of the widow's mite present in the Synoptic Gospels (, ,). The concept also includes relativism: some may be poor but they can consider themselves \\"nakaluluwag\\" to those who are much poorer, as rendered in a Tagalog commentaryhttp://www.bible.claret.org/bibles/bsp_pdf/2-OLD%20TESTAMENT/4-Mga%20Propeta/2_Jeremiah/2_Jer%2020-36.pdf on . Even Filipino converts to the Church of the Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) translates the phrase \\"the rich\\" as \\"nakaluluwag\\". Those taking the Conflict theory approach to the study of society may suspect the true intentions of the \\"nakaluluwag\\". However, some consider more than the financial aspect of the concept. The ethic involves fulfillment in doing a social obligation.http://simplyrachel.onewickedsoul.com/wp/?p=172 This Filipino concept appears to be present even for the Filipino emigrants. According to Antonio Levy S. Ingles Jr. of De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde,http://www.dls-csb.edu.ph this Filipino ethic is priceless and may bring about peace and harmony during times of crisis. He claims that \\"it is a Filipino affirmation of a sustainable world view and global care-giving ethic\\".

Ryan was part of the successful New South Wales Kings Cup crew who had a breakthrough win in 2008, defeating holders Victoria by just 0.21 seconds. It was the start of a 7-year winning streak for New South Wales in this event, with Ryan being a member of the crew every year. National representative rowing Ryan was first selected to compete for Australia in 2002, when he stroked the Australian junior coxed four to a gold medal at the World Junior Championships in Trakai, Lithuania. Continuing to move through the underage ranks, Ryan was a bronze medallist in 2003 in the Men's VIII at the Nations Cup regatta (now the World Under 23 Championships) in Belgrade, Serbia.

This was later improved to a 7th placing overall due to the members of the Russian crew failing doping tests. Ryan made his Olympic debut in 2008 in Beijing, China. Rowing Australia had originally selected the coxless pair and eight as the priority sweep rowing crews as they had already qualified for the Olympic Games from the results at the World Championships the previous year. Ryan was selected in the Coxless Four alongside fellow Sydney University Boat Club member Francis Hegerty, as well as Victorians, James Marburg and Cameron McKenzie-McHarg. The crew won their event at the first world cup regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland. The crew then turned their attention to the Olympic Qualification Regatta in Poznan.

In 2013, Ryan took a break from international competition and during this period set a 24-hour tandem world record on the Concept 2 rowing machine (ergometer) with Sam Loch. The pair covered 380.274 kilometres, maintaining an average split of 1:53.6 per 500 metres. The successful world record attempt was also a fundraiser for the Leukaemia Foundation and raised almost $20,000 AUD for the charity. Ryan returned to the National Team in 2015 in the Men's VIII .

This short-lived stationRAILSCOT was the temporary terminus of the branch line from Drem. The station was named after a nearby farm, the modern spelling of which is Williamston. History Williamstown was a temporary station built to serve the town of North Berwick until the permanent terminus in the town was completed. It was open from 13 August 1849, when the branch from Drem opened, until 17 June 1850 when North Berwick and Dirleton stations opened. The station at Williamstown was then removed, and no trace of it now remains. Had the Aberlady, Gullane and North Berwick Railway completed their projected line, it would have formed a junction with the North Berwick branch just south of Williamston. However, the line did not progress any further than Gullane. The former North Berwick gasworks at Ferrygate was a short distance south-west of Williamston. The gasworks was once an important customer for the railway, receiving large quantities of coal. The gasworks closed in 1972, by which time its two sidings (controlled by a ground frame) were already out of use. Previous services  References   Notes   Sources  Hajducki, Andrew M.

The fossil is also known by a second name, Telerpeton, which is derived from the Greek bases tele for \\"far off\\" and herpeton for \\"reptile.\\" In Scotland, Leptopleuron was found specifically in the Lossiemouth Sandstone Formation. The yellow sandstone it was located in was poorly lithified with wind coming from the southwest. The environment is also described to consist of barchan dunes due to the winds, ranging up to 20 m tall that spread during dry phases into flood plains. Procolophonoids such as Leptopleuron were considered an essential addition to the terrestrial ecosystem during the Triassic. Discovery and history A depiction of Leptopleuron and its noticeably slender ribs Discovered near Elgin, northern Scotland, from the Lossiemouth Formation in 1851, the fossil was examined and named Leptopleuron by Richard Owen. The reptilian fossil was initially evidence against progressionism, supporting the words of Charles Lyell, but with discussion was later accepted from the Triassic and for progressionism in 1860 after he became a progressionist. Controversy arose later when news broke out that the discoverer asked English paleontologist Gideon Mantell to make a lengthier description of the fossil, calling it Telerpeton. The general consensus that Owen produced a description of the fossil with hostility toward both Lyell and Mantell was also an issue. However, later analysis found that Mantell only produced a description as requested by Lyell, knowing that Owen was composing his own at the same time. Leptopleuron is the most accepted term for the reptile as Owen published before Mantell and made the most accurate interpretations. Description Leptopleuron was a small, lizard-like animal of 270 mm that possessed a long tail as well as gastralia in contrast to Sclerosaurus, and a slight triangular depression on its jugal. As a reptile, five metatarsals were observed with lengths of roughly 8 mm with unknown values for some. In terms of its dentary, towards the posterior end, the ramus is notably deep. Its sacral ribs do not attach to the vertebrae after reconstruction of the fossil. The neural spines of Leptopleuron, in particular, lean backwards as comparable and observed in Anomoiodon liliensterni and the genus Kapes. Acrodont dentition is evident in leptopleurons as well. A head illustration of Leptopleuron, demonstrating its fangs Osteology of the skull After reconstruction, the skull reached 55 mm long. The width of the skull was as long as the length of the skull when ignoring the quadratojugal horns as well. Some features of Leptopleuron include the size of its frontals. In contrast to other taxa, the width in the middle of the orbits are not the same as the width of its frontals in the anterior segment. Leptopleuron demonstrates a narrower anterior portion instead. No septomaxilla was observed, but the external naris is oval and immense in size. The maxilla contained five teeth with a significant difference for the tooth row as in contrast to Hypsognathus, the tooth row ended around the anterior region of the orbitotemporal opening. The prefrontal of Leptopleuron is seen to have dorsal exposure in the center of the lacrimal and frontal bones with the anterior edge enveloped by the nasals. The lacrimal is extremely concave at the whole orbital region, creating an immense depression heading toward the snout interior. This depression is known to enter the posterior of the orbitonasal canal after analysis. The parietal occupies the space for the postfrontal as this feature is absent in Leptopleuron. The pineal foramen is large and between the parietals and frontals. Its orbitotemporal openings are not relatively long and are similar to those of Procolophon. The jugal is also known to come into contact with the posterolateral extension of the nasal at its anterior end and barely touches the postorbital. The two spines of the quadratojugal are both flattened dorsoventrally, contain evident grooves, and are roughly the same size. Leptopleuron does not have a quadrate foramen as well, but the center part of the quadrate is stretched transversely. Notably, this bone is seen to connect with the pterygoid at the quadrate flange. Leptopleuron has also been identified to have vomerine dentition with short and long pairs of fangs. The tail fangs are at the anterior end of the vomer while the posterior end holds the short fangs. The palatine can only be seen in dorsal view and not in palatal view. The braincase Sharing similarities with other procolophonids, the braincase of Leptopleuron consists of a relatively long basisphenoid that covers the front part of the basioccipital. Other apomorphies include a tripartite occipital condyle and a metotic foramen exposed anteriorly and unwalled by bone. Taking up the bottom half of the tripartite occipital condyle, the basioccipital is easily identified for having a large anterior portion. On the other hand, the exoccipitals are at the dorsolateral portion of the condyle and its arch-like supraoccipital forms the most dorsal edge of the foramen magnum as it is integrated with the prootic located anterolaterally. On the supraoccipital, a slight groove can be seen at each anteroventral extremity, particularly at the dorsolateral side. Leptopleuron is also characterized by its opisthotic having no foramen on the ventral ramus, specifically for nerve IX. The opisthotic is identified by a short transverse ridge that flanks a relatively deep and crescent moon-like notch ventrally. As for the prootic, the anteroventral process extends out into a free-standing distal plate rounded at the anterior. Characteristic of Leptopleuron as well is its extremely tiny stapes with a cone-like and obtusely sub-triangular footplate in lateral view. It was also known that its opisthotic and basioccipital did not come into contact with each other. Paleobiology Diet Based on its dentition, Leptopleuron likely fed on coarse and fibrous vegetation or hard-shelled invertebrates as it possessed two-cusped marginal teeth that were labio-lingually spread out. Analysis also suggests vegetation in its diet as a procolophonid because of its trunks being larger and wider than those belonging to Owenettidae, indicated by their slimmer body shape. Burrowing The horned triangular head of Leptopleuron, as well as an overbite comparable to the horned sand lizard, were evident of its burrowing lifestyle. With an overbite aiding in less ingestion of dirt, along with spade-like unguals and strong limbs for efficient digging, Leptopleuron was likened to today's burrowers of Phrynosoma, a genus consisting of horned lizards. Skepticism remains, however, due to both its manus and pes having slender phalanges and unguals compared to Procolophon, which is characteristically inefficient for dredging through dirt.

Biography Born in Naples, Croccolo began his acting career on the radio and he appeared in more than 100 films since 1949. His debut came in the 1949 film The Firemen of Viggi√π and he made his first television debut in 1956. He was best known for some of his collaborations with Tot√≤ mainly throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Croccolo‚Äôs international appearance came from the 1996 film In Love and War directed by Richard Attenborough. He also had an intense theatrical career as he often starred in plays directed by Eduardo De Filippo and Giorgio Strehler. As a voice actor, Croccolo performed the Italian voice of Oliver Hardy in the 1951-1953 redubs of Laurel and Hardy in which he was paired with Fiorenzo Fiorentini (the Italian voice of Stan Laurel). He returned to dub Hardy in the 1968-1970 redubs, this time, paired with Franco Latini. Since 1957, Croccolo had served as a dubbing artist for Tot√≤ in some of his films.Cronologia fondamentale dell'epoca d'oro del doppiaggio italiano Dagli albori agli anni 1970 (in Italian) In 1989, Croccolo received the David di Donatello for best supporting actor in the film 'O Re.

Different variants of the game have been played in different parts of S√°pmi. Names The word \\"dablo\\" is a non-S√°mi attempt to write the South S√°mi word daabloe and the Lule S√°mi word d√°bllo. This word actually just means \\"board game\\" or \\"gameboard\\". In South S√°mi, daabloe may also mean \\"grid pattern\\". Another term for the game is ' which is in modern South S√°mi spelling . This simply means \\"to play a board game on a board\\", as opposed to , a children's variant of the game that is played on a reindeer hide rather than a board. The game is likely to have had another name than these among the S√°mi, but outside researchers confused the name for the general activity \\"board gaming\\" with the name of the concrete games. This was also done when outside researchers wrote down the rules for the S√°mi tafl game now called Tablut. In that case, the Lule S√°mi word (\\"to play a board game\\") was mistaken for the name of the game. In North S√°mi, Dablo has been known as cuhkka, a word that means \\"broken\\" or \\"destroyed\\". The player who loses the game is said to be \\"cuhkka\\", cf. Checkmate. Description The following describes one version of the South S√°mi variant of the game, and is not representative for other dablo variants. Sami people are represented in this game with one piece representing the Sami King (\\"g√•nneka\\"), one piece representing the Sami Prince (\\"g√•nnekan alke\\"), and 28 pieces representing their soldiers or warriors (\\"d√•rake\\"), . The landowners are represented with one piece representing the landowner, one piece representing the landowner's son, and 28 pieces representing their peasants. The game is a relative of draughts and Alquerque. Pieces leap over one another to capture. However, the similarities basically end there. In draughts and Alquerque, any piece can capture any enemy piece whether that enemy piece is a King or not. In Dablot Prejessne, pieces can only capture each other if they are of the same rank or lower. They cannot capture pieces of a higher rank. The Sami King and the landowner are the highest ranked pieces and are equal in rank, therefore, they can capture each other and all other pieces. The Sami Prince and the landowner's son are the second highest ranked pieces, and are of equal rank. The Sami Prince can not capture the landowner, and likewise, the landowner's son can not capture the Sami King. However, they can capture each other, and all the other pieces. The 28 soldiers or warriors and the 28 peasants are the lowest ranked pieces. The 28 soldiers or warriors can not capture the landowner or the landowner's son. Likewise, the 28 peasants cannot capture the Sami King or the Sami Prince. However, they can capture each other. All pieces do move alike, and can move and capture in any direction. There is no promotion of pieces in Dablot Prejjesne. Its closest relative in the draught family may be Italian Checkers and Italian Damone. In all these games, a lower rank piece can not capture a higher rank piece. However, in Dablot Prejjesne ranks are pre-determined, and never change, whereas, in Italian checkers, pieces must be promoted to King in order to gain higher rank. In Italian Damone there are pre-determined ranked pieces also, however, it is played on an 8 x 8 draughts board with far fewer pieces as compared to Dablot Prejjesne. The board used is very similar to that of Kharbaga. The difference is that in Kharbaga, the board is 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 whereas in Dablot Prejjesne, the board is 6 x 7. Goal A player wins if it captures all their opponent's pieces. There are additional winning conditions common in variants; see the rules section below. A draw is possible by mutual agreement or after a number of turns made by each player without a capture. Equipment The board used is a 6 (width) x 7 (length) grid board with diagonal lines running through each \\"square\\" of the board. Pieces are placed on the intersections between gridlines similar to Alquerque and its variants, instead of within the square spaces as in other draughts variants. Each player has 30 pieces total. One player traditionally plays the Sami tribe, which can be the red or white colored pieces, and one player plays the landowner party, which are the black colored pieces. The Sami tribe consist of 1 Sami King piece, 1 Sami Prince piece, and 28 soldiers or warriors (referred to as soldiers in this article). The Landowner party consist of 1 Landowner piece, 1 Landowner's Son piece, and 28 peasants. For simplicity, both sides' pieces can be referred to by the names of the Sami side (King, Prince and Soldiers), as the distinction between the names for each side's pieces has no significant in-game meaning. This article will however use the appropriate names for each side. Rules and gameplay 1\\\\. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. 2\\\\. The 28 soldiers or peasants are initially set up on each player's half of the board, on each intersection of the gridlines of the first 5 ranks (including the intersections of the diagonals in between the \\"main\\" orthogonal grid). The Sami Prince is placed on the sixth rank, on the intersection of diagonals to that player's farthest right. The Sami King is placed on the seventh rank, at the right edge of the board (please refer to the image above and the first external link below for a visual description of the initial setup for both Sami tribe and landowner party). Similarly, the Landowner's Son and Landowner are placed on that player's farthest right on the sixth and seventh rank, respectively. 3\\\\. All pieces move alike. A piece moves one space along one of the gridlines to any adjacent, unoccupied intersection. All pieces can move forward or backward at any time. Only one piece may be moved per turn, or used to capture. 4\\\\. Pieces may capture other pieces by jumping over them, similar to draughts. The piece must jump over a single adjacent opposing piece, and land on an unoccupied space on the exact opposite side of the jumped piece from its starting location. The jumped opposing piece is removed from play. A piece cannot jump over two opposing pieces in one jump, nor may it jump over a piece of its own color or jump over a piece into a space that is occupied (whether by that player or his opponent). A piece can make multiple jumps in one turn, even changing direction from one jump to the next, as long as the prior rules are followed. 4a. As the original rules for Dablot Prejjesne are not completely known, it is unknown if capturing was originally compulsory. However, in modern play of the game, similar to other draughts variants, a player who has an available capture or chain of captures is required to make the . If the player has a choice regarding two or more pieces that can be used to capture, or between two or more \\"paths\\" for multiple captures by a single piece, the player may choose freely which piece to use or which sequence of captures to make, but cannot choose not to capture if one is possible. 5\\\\. Pieces can only capture opposing pieces of equal or lower rank. The Sami King and Landowner are the highest ranked pieces and are of equal rank to one another, therefore, they can capture each other, and all the other pieces. The Sami Prince and the Landowner's Son are the second highest ranked pieces, and cannot capture the Sami King or Landowner; however, they can capture each other, and the other lower pieces. The Sami soldiers and peasants are the lowest ranked pieces. They can not capture the Sami King or Sami Prince, or the Landowner or Landowner's Son; however, they can capture each other. This is a primary difference between Dablot and most other draughts variants. 6\\\\. There is no promotion of pieces in this game; a player cannot recover a captured King, Landowner, Prince or Son, or augment their numbers of these pieces. Variations Some variants of this game include additional winning conditions which further speed the pace of the game, such as: * Trapping all remaining opposing pieces so that one's opponent cannot make a move - This is a common secondary winning condition, making stalemate a victory for the player who forces it, instead of a draw. * Capturing the opposing King or Landowner - this is usually a crippling blow to a player in any case, as he can no longer win by capturing all his opponent's pieces; he can only do so by trapping his opponent's remaining forces as above. * Capturing both the opposing King/Landowner and the Prince/Son - At this point, in the conflict being modeled in the game, the lower-ranking forces would likely surrender. Again, it is still possible though more difficult to win after losing both the King and Prince, by trapping all opposing pieces to force a stalemate.

It is separated by a deep oceanic pass some 45 km wide from nearby Elizabeth Reef, forming part of the Lord Howe Rise underwater plateau. It is around 220 km from Lord Howe Island and 555 km from the coast of New South Wales. In 1997 the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 included the reef in Australia's Coral Sea Islands Territory . It is among the southernmost platform reefs in the world. Despite its relatively high latitude, there is a wide variety of flora and fauna on the reef and in the surrounding waters, due to converging tropical and temperate ocean currents. It is about 8.9 km long by 6.3 km wide. At low tide most of the reef flat is exposed, at high tide only one cay is visible, The Sound, 100 m by 70 m and one metre above sea level. The reefs form the Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs Marine National Park Reserve managed by the Government of Australia under the Natural Heritage Trust.

Sun In Serbian belief, Sun is anthropomorphised as a man. Sometimes, Moon is described as Sun's brother or uncle, Venus as his daughter or (in one song) wife, or both stars and Venus as his sisters. Of Sun's parents, only mother is ever mentioned. Some common Proto-Indo-European beliefs about Sun are preserved: a belief that Sun is riding in a cart or riding a horse, or that it is God's eye. Various beliefs exist that explain Sun's role regarding day and night: that it travels underground or under the sea during the night to emerge again during the day, or that it dies every sunset to be born anew the next sunrise. Sun is also present in a number of other folk beliefs and customs. Moon Moon is also anthropomorphised as a man. Moon is sometimes described as Sun's brother or uncle, and Venus as Moon's sister or wife. Also, sometimes Moon's mother or children (meseƒçiƒá) are mentioned, apparently not referring to any astronomical objects. A great deal of attention in folk beliefs is given to Moon phases, with new Moon respected as bringer of good fortune, and full Moon also viewed positively. There are various explanations about the Man in the Moon, which is viewed as a head of an animal, or as a human. Venus Depending on how it appears, Venus may be called differently: * Danica - Day star, signifying that it could be seen during the day; Danica is also a female given name. * Zornjaƒça - Morning star, when it appears in the morning. * Veƒçernjaƒça - Evening star, when it appears in the evening. * Sometimes, Prehodnica or Preodnica - literally \\"crosser over\\", signifying that it appears on both sides of the sky (Eastern and Western) and the understanding that it crosses from one side of the sky to the other. Venus is anthropomorphised as a woman, sometimes described as Sun's daughter or (in one song) wife, Sun's or Moon's sister, Moon's wife and in some songs as blood sister (posestrima) of Prince Marko. It is regarded as harbinger of dawn and day. Meteorites Serbian mythical creatures called zmaj, usually translated as dragon, are described variously, as either snake-like monsters (see also a≈ædaja), humans with supernatural abilities, or flying fiery creatures; these fiery dragons can be identified as meteorites. They are described as flying across the sky while shining, generally at night, with fire flowing from their wings, and producing a loud noise. In some regions it was believed that a shooting star indicated a captive, slave or soldier had broken free, or that one man is chasing another to fight with. It was a custom that the person who saw the shooting star remained silent at that moment, as uttering a sound might disclose the fugitive. By another custom the person should say, \\"Behind a bramble, behind a bush, hide!\\", \\"Run to the mountain!\\" or similar. Stars Stars are anthropomorphised as women, sometimes described as sisters of Sun and Moon. A variety of beliefs about them exist. Sirius Serbian name for Sirius is Svinjarka, Svinjaru≈°a (svinja = pig), Volarica or Volujara (vo = ox). In some regions, appearance of Sirius signifies that pigs should be released to pannage on acorns. Asterisms Big and Little Dipper are called Velika kola (Big cart) and Mala kola (Little cart) in Serbian language. Another Serbian asterism is Porednice (red = queue), identified as Orion's Belt and Sword. Other asterisms are recorded, such as Volovi (oxen) and Trougao (triangle), but it is unclear what stars they refer to. Pleiades In Serbian language, Pleiades are called Vla≈°iƒái or Sedam vla≈°iƒáa (Sedam = seven). While the name is identical to \\"Little Vlachs\\" (\\"Seven little Vlachs\\"), this is a folk etymology, and it is in fact derived from Slavic god of cattle and underworld, Veles. A number of stories about the Pleiade's origin exist. The stars are described as seven brothers, or six brothers and a sister. Several sets of their names are recorded, for example: * Mika and Mioka, Raka and Raoka, Orisav and Borisav and seventh Milisav; * Vole and Voleta, Rale and Raleta, Mile and Mileta and little Pr≈æo≈æak. Pleiades are used to determine appropriate dates for various field works, or to measure time by night. Sometimes, when they appear on the sky, they are called kvoƒçka s piliƒáima (\\"hen with chicklets\\"). Milky Way In Serbian language, Milky Way is called Kumova slama (kum's straw). A legend explains that once, a kum stole straw from another, but as he was carrying it away, he was losing some of it. Then, God put the straw in the sky as a permanent warning not to steal.

The expression was documented for the first time in a charter issued in 1217. By the end of the 13th century, the use of the expression ceased, and the \\"royal servants\\" merged into the nobility of the kingdom and they formed the basis of the lesser nobility. In the 11-12th centuries, the ancestors of the \\"royal servants\\" can be found among the \\"freemen\\" who provided military services to the kings and whose troops were led by the kings and not by the heads of the \\"royal counties\\". \\"Castle warriors\\" also increased the number of \\"royal servants\\" if the king liberated them from the services they had been obliged to provide to the heads of the royal castles. Even serfs could receive their liberties provided that the king not only liberated them personally but also granted them possessions. The \\"royal servants'\\" freedom became endangered during the reign of King Andrew II (1205-1235) who granted whole \\"royal counties\\" (i.e., all the royal domains in the counties) to his partisans. The new lords endeavoured to expand their supremacy over the \\"royal servants\\" who owned possessions in the county. However, the \\"royal servants'\\" commenced to organize themselves and they persuaded the king to issue the Golden Bull, a royal decree summarizing and confirming their following liberties: * \\"royal servants\\" could not be arrested without a verdict; * they were exempt from taxation; * they were entitled to dispose of their properties in their last will in case they died without a male descendant, with the exception of the quarter due to their daughters; * \\"royal servants\\" were exempted from the jurisdiction of the heads of the counties; * outside the realm, they were obliged to serve in the king's army only for remuneration. The provisions of the Golden Bull were later confirmed several times by the kings (it was King Andrew II himself who confirmed them for the first time in 1231) and therefore, they formed the basis of the \\"cardinal liberties\\" of the nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary. Although, \\"royal servants\\" who lived in some provinces of the Kingdom (e.g., the \\"royal servants\\" of Transylvania and in Slavonia) could not enjoy all the liberties confirmed by the Golden Bull, because they still were obliged to pay their special taxes, but by the second half of the 14th century, they also became an integrated part of the nobility. Following the Golden Bull, a deed issued, in 1232, by the \\"royal servants\\" living in Zala county indicated a new step towards the formation of institutes of their self-government: in the deed, they judged the lawsuit of Bartholomew, Bishop of Veszpr√©m, which proved that the counties, that had been formerly the basic units of royal administration, commenced to turn into an administrative unit governed by the developing nobility. From the 1230s, the terminology used in the royal charters when they referred to \\"royal servants\\" began to change and they were more and more frequently mentioned as \\"noble servants\\" () and later, as \\"nobles or servants\\" (), while finally, the Decree of 1267 issued by King B√©la IV (1235-1270) identified the \\"royal servants\\" with the nobles. Thenceforward, the expression vanished from the documents, and the descendants of the \\"royal servants\\" were mentioned as nobiles. Following 1267, only the Hungarian word for the two or four members of the County Courts elected by the nobiles (i.e., szolgab√≠r√≥ that literally means \\"servants' judge\\") reserved the memory of the expression.

It was an intermediate station on the branch line from Drem. History Dirleton station was a small station with a single platform and two sidings on the south side of the line. There was no signalbox, and the siding points were controlled by a ground frame. Dirleton station closed to passengers on 1 February 1954, with the goods yard surviving as an unstaffed public siding until 1 June 1959. The station house is now privately owned, and the station site is clearly visible from passing trains. Although named for the village of Dirleton, the station was actually some distance away, approximately halfway between Dirleton and Kingston. A plan to give Direlton a more convenient station was put forward by the Aberlady, Gullane and North Berwick Railway, which was founded in 1893. This company opened its line from Spittal (Aberlady Junction) near Longniddry to Gullane in 1898, but plans to extend it to join the North Berwick branch near Williamstown were never implemented.

The album became the Salaz√°r sisters' international breakthrough. The title track \\"Bandido\\" was chosen to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1990, held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. A house music anthem, co-written and produced by the well-known guitar player and producer Jaime Stinus and one of Spain's most prolific dance producers Ra√∫l Orellana, complete with palmas and flamenco guitars, \\"Bandido\\" was turned down by the bookmakers before the contest since Spain's previous ethnic entries usually never fared well; in 1983 fellow flamenco singer Remedios Amaya's \\"¬øQui√©n maneja mi barca?\\" had for example finished last with zero points. Despite this the song finished an honourable fifth and was given the full 12 points score from countries like West Germany and it became the starting point of Az√∫car Moreno's international career. \\"Bandido\\" became a major club hit in the summer of 1990 not only in the Mediterranean countries but also the rest of Continental Europe and Scandinavia and the 12\\" Deep Mix, issued with a new promo video, was put on heavy rotation on music TV channels like MTV Europe and Super Channel. In Sweden the song was remixed by DJ Emil Hellman and re- issued on the Swemix label. The song has been covered in Turkish by singer Askin Nur Yengi under the title \\"Zehir Gibisin\\", in Dutch as \\"Alleen maar de zon\\" by Paul de Leeuw and the Deep Mix version of the song was recorded in Spanish by Serbian singer Ceca Raznatovic. In 2005 \\"Bandido\\" was included in the Eurovision 50th anniversary CD/DVD box set Winners and classics. The Bandido album, which sold triple platinum in Spain, was the first to be released in most parts of the world, including Europe, the Middle East, South and Central America and later also Japan, Australasia and the United States, where it reached #3 on Billboard's Latin Pop chart.[ Allmusic.com, Az√∫car Moreno charts and awards, Billboard albums.] Bandido continued the musical development started on the preceding Carne De Melocot√≥n by combining the sisters' typical ethnic vocal style with flamenco guitars and influences from contemporary rock, pop and dance music. Besides original material the album also included a number of cover versions of songs from a diverse range of genres, including Latin traditionals like \\"A Caballo\\" (also known as \\"El Carretero\\"), American jazz and mambo king Tito Puente's standard \\"Oye Como Va\\" coupled with Santana's \\"Guajira\\", Spanish Flamenco singer-songwriter Pepe de Luc√≠a's \\"Rumba Rumba\\" - and even a house music/flamenco version of Mary Hopkin's 60's hit \\"Those Were the Days\\", originally a Russian folk melody. The second single released from the album in Spain was a cover of Lalo Rodr√≠guez' 80s hit \\"Ven Dev√≥rame Otra Vez\\" which became an even bigger success than \\"Bandido\\", reaching #9 on Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks chart,[ Allmusic.com, Az√∫car Moreno charts and awards, Billboard singles.] and today counts as one of the duo's signature tunes, they even re-recorded the track on their 2006 album Bailando Con Lola.

It is around 160 km from Lord Howe Island and 555 km from the New South Wales coast of Australia. The Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Act 1997 included Elizabeth Reef in Australia's Coral Sea Islands Territory. It is the southernmost coral atoll in the world and one of the southernmost platform reefs in the world. It measures 8.2 km by 5.5 km. Despite the relatively high latitude, a wide variety of flora and fauna exists on the reef and in the surrounding waters due to their location where tropical and temperate ocean currents converge. At low tide most of the reef flat is exposed; at high tide, both a cay and a sand spit are visible. Elizabeth Island, with a diameter of about 400 m, is one metre above sea level.

Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.Hu, Sugiyama & Silk (1996-04-28), p. 2 The strength of diffusion damping is calculated by a mathematical expression for the damping factor, which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). The primary effects on the diffusion length are from the properties of the plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process. The scale on which diffusion damping works is called the Silk scale and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day. The mass contained within the Silk scale is called the Silk mass and it corresponds to the mass of the galaxies. Introduction The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature anisotropy in terms of the angular scale (or multipole moment). Diffusion damping can be easily seen in the suppression of power peaks when l ‚â≥ 1000. Diffusion damping took place about 13.8 billion years ago, during the stage of the early universe called recombination or matter-radiation decoupling. This period occurred about 320,000 years after the Big Bang. This is equivalent to a redshift of around z = 1090. Recombination was the stage during which simple atoms, e.g. hydrogen and helium, began to form in the cooling, but still very hot, soup of protons, electrons and photons that composed the universe. Prior to the recombination epoch, this soup, a plasma, was largely opaque to the electromagnetic radiation of photons. This meant that the permanently excited photons were scattered by the protons and electrons too often to travel very far in straight lines.Hu (1995-08-26), p. 6 During the recombination epoch, the universe cooled rapidly as free electrons were captured by atomic nuclei; atoms formed from their constituent parts and the universe became transparent: the amount of photon scattering decreased dramatically. Scattering less, photons could diffuse (travel) much greater distances.Liddle & Lyth (2000-04-13), p. 63, 120 There was no significant diffusion damping for electrons, which could not diffuse nearly as far as photons could in similar circumstances. Thus all damping by electron diffusion is negligible when compared to photon diffusion damping.Padmanabhan (1993-06-25), p. 171-2 Acoustic perturbations of initial density fluctuations in the universe made some regions of space hotter and denser than others.Harrison (1970-05-15) These differences in temperature and density are called anisotropies. Photons diffused from the hot, overdense regions of plasma to the cold, underdense ones: they dragged along the protons and electrons: the photons pushed electrons along, and these, in turn, pulled on protons by the Coulomb force. This caused the temperatures and densities of the hot and cold regions to be averaged and the universe became less anisotropic (characteristically various) and more isotropic (characteristically uniform). This reduction in anisotropy is the damping of diffusion damping. Diffusion damping thus damps temperature and density anisotropies in the early universe. With baryonic matter (protons and electrons) escaping the dense areas along with the photons; the temperature and density inequalities were adiabatically damped. That is to say the ratios of photons to baryons remained constant during the damping process.Madsen (1996-05-15), p. 99-100Longair (2008-01-08), p. 355Jetzer & Pretzl (2002-07-31), p. 6Rich (2001-06-15), p. 256 Photon diffusion was first described in Joseph Silk's 1968 paper entitled \\"Cosmic Black-Body Radiation and Galaxy Formation\\",Silk (1968-02-01) which was published in The Astrophysical Journal. As such, diffusion damping is sometimes also called Silk damping, though this term may apply only to one possible damping scenario.Partridge (1995-09-29), p. 302Bonometto, Gorini & Moschella (2001-12-15), p. 55 Silk damping was thus named after its discoverer.Madsen (1996-05-15), p. 99-101Hu (1994-06-28), p. 15 Magnitude The magnitude of diffusion damping is calculated as a damping factor or suppression factor, represented by the symbol \\\\mathcal{D} , which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). What affect the diffusion length are primarily the properties of the plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process. : \\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\mathit{k}) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\eta_0} \\\\dot{\\\\tau}e^{-[\\\\mathit{k}/{\\\\mathit{k}_\\\\mathit{D}(\\\\eta)}]^2}\\\\; d\\\\eta.

In diffusion damping, photons from hot regions diffuse to cold regions by random walk, so after \\\\mathit{N} steps, the photons have travelled a distance \\\\lambda_D=\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathit{N}}\\\\lambda_C. Mathematical calculations of the damping factor depend on \\\\mathit{k}_\\\\mathit{D} , or the effective diffusion scale, which in turn depends on a crucial value, the diffusion length, \\\\lambda_\\\\mathit{D} .Hu, Sugiyama & Silk (1996-04-28), p. 5 The diffusion length relates how far photons travel during diffusion, and comprises a finite number of short steps in random directions. The average of these steps is the Compton mean free path, and is denoted by \\\\lambda_\\\\mathit{C}. As the direction of these steps are randomly taken, \\\\lambda_\\\\mathit{D} is approximately equal to \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathit{N}} \\\\lambda_\\\\mathit{C} , where \\\\mathit{N} is the number of steps the photon takes before the conformal time at decoupling (\\\\mathit{\\\\eta}_\\\\ast).Hu (1995-08-26), p. 12-13 The diffusion length increases at recombination because the mean free path does, with less photon scattering occurring; this increases the amount of diffusion and damping. The mean free path increases because the electron ionisation fraction, \\\\mathit{x}_\\\\mathit{e} , decreases as ionised hydrogen and helium bind with the free, charged electrons. As this occurs, the mean free path increases proportionally: \\\\lambda_\\\\mathit{C} \\\\varpropto {(\\\\mathit{x}_\\\\mathit{e} \\\\mathit{n}_\\\\mathit{b})}^{-1} . That is, the mean free path of the photons is inversely proportional to the electron ionisation fraction and the baryon number density (\\\\mathit{n}_\\\\mathit{b}). That means that the more baryons there were, and the more they were ionised, the shorter the average photon could travel before encountering one and being scattered. Small changes to these values before or during recombination can augment the damping effect considerably. This dependence on the baryon density by photon diffusion allows scientists to use analysis of the latter to investigate the former, in addition to the history of ionisation. The effect of diffusion damping is greatly augmented by the finite width of the surface of last scattering (SLS).(1995-08-26), p. 137 The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase.Durrer (2001-09-17), p. 5 It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.Hu (1995-08-26), pp. 156‚Äì7  Model dependence  In general, diffusion damping produces its effects independent of the cosmological model being studied, thereby masking the effects of other, model- dependent phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge the relative merits of cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be more visible.Hu (1995-08-26), p. 136-8Hu & White (1997-04-20), p. 568-9 Though general diffusion damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term Silk damping applies only to damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them. Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less damping. Photon diffusion is not dependent on the causes of the initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.  Effects   Speed  Damping occurs at two different scales, with the process working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length is one that is lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.  The Silk scale and the Silk mass  Diffusion damping exponentially decreases anisotropies in the CMB on a scale (the Silk scale) much smaller than a degree, or smaller than approximately 3 megaparsecs.Bonometto, Gorini & Moschella (2001-12-15), p. 227-8 This angular scale corresponds to a multipole moment \\\\mathit{l} \\\\gtrsim 800.Papantonopoulos (2005-03-24), p. 63 The mass contained within the Silk scale is the silk mass. Numerical evaluations of the Silk mass yield results on the order of 10^{13} solar masses at recombinationJedamzik, Kataliniƒá & Olinto (1996-06-13), p. 1-2 and on the order of the mass of a present-day galaxy or galaxy cluster in the current era. : \\\\mathit{M}_\\\\mathit{s} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\mathit{m}_\\\\mathit{p} {\\\\mathit{t}_\\\\mathit{rec}}^{3/2}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathit{n}_\\\\mathit{rec} \\\\sigma^3}}. Scientists say diffusion damping affects small angles and corresponding anisotropies. Other effects operate on a scale called intermediate 10 \\\\lesssim \\\\mathit{l} \\\\lesssim 100 or large \\\\mathit{l} \\\\lessapprox 10 . Searches for anisotropies on a small scale are not as difficult as those on larger scales, partly because they may employ ground-based telescopes and their results can be more easily predicted by current theoretical models.Kaiser & Silk (1986-12-11), p. 533  Galaxy formation  Scientists study photon diffusion damping (and CMB anisotropies in general) because of the insight the subject provides into the question, \\"How did the universe come to be?\\". Specifically, primordial anisotropies in the temperature and density of the universe are supposed to be the causes of later large-scale structure formation. Thus it was the amplification of small perturbations in the pre- recombination universe that grew into the galaxies and galaxy clusters of the present era. Diffusion damping made the universe isotropic within distances on the order of the Silk Scale. That this scale corresponds to the size of observed galaxies (when the passage of time is taken into account) implies that diffusion damping is responsible for limiting the size of these galaxies. The theory is that clumps of matter in the early universe became the galaxies that we see today, and the size of these galaxies is related to the temperature and density of the clumps.Hu & Sugiyama (1994-07-28), p. 2Sunyaev & Zel'dovich (Sept. 1980), p. 1 Diffusion may also have had a significant effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.Brandenburg, Enqvist & Olesen (January 1997), p. 2  See also  *Chronology of the universe *Joseph Silk *Photon diffusion *Timeline of cosmological theories  Notes   References   Bibliography        External links  *Diffusion damping explained in a \\"1997 Travelguide to CMB physics\\" by Wayne Hu Physical cosmology Plasma physics ","title":"Diffusion damping"},{"id":"18889627","text":"Jacqueline Lawrence may refer to: * Jackie Lawrence (politician) (born 1948), British politician * Jacqueline Lawrence (canoeist) (born 1982), Australian slalom canoeist ","title":"Jacqueline Lawrence"},{"id":"18889629","text":"Wu You (; born 27 March 1984 in Jinzhou, Liaoning) is a female Chinese rower, who won silver medal in the Women's double sculls at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Biography Nic Potter was born in Wiltshire and left school at 15, originally to train in carpentry. His older sister Sally, is a well-known film director. At the age of 16, he joined a late line-up of The Misunderstood, at the same time as drummer Guy Evans, who had joined from Van der Graaf Generator, then on a brief hiatus. When Van der Graaf decided to reform after the release The Aerosol Grey Machine, and earlier bassist Keith Ellis deciding to join Juicy Lucy instead, Evans recommended that Potter join as a replacement. Potter first appeared on the album The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other, also playing some electric guitar on a few tracks in addition to his usual bass. Halfway during the recording of the following album H to He, Who Am the Only One (1970), he left the group after recording three tracks (\\"Killer\\", \\"The Emperor in his War Room\\" and \\"Lost\\"). The remainder of the album's bass tracks were completed by organist Hugh Banton, who took over the bass lines on bass pedals in concert. Potter remained in touch with the band, and in 1971, he played bass-guitar on Peter Hammill's first solo-album, Fool's Mate, on Colin Scot's album Colin Scot and with the band Magna Carta. In the 1970s he also played with Jeff Beck, Chuck Berry, Rare Bird and Steve Swindells. In 1973 he collaborated on The Long Hello project. His playing can also be heard on Peter Hammill's album Over (1977). In 1977, after Hugh Banton and David Jackson had left Van der Graaf Generator, Potter was asked to re-join. He plays on both The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome (1977) and the double live-album Vital (1978). However, he was still uncomfortable with the dynamic of the band as he had been previously, stating \\"sometimes it felt like a cloud coming down ‚Äì a very ominous feeling.\\" He was particularly concerned at a gig in Annecy, France where he claimed someone was trying to perform an exorcism of the band's music while on stage, and had to be helped back to the dressing room, feeling very shaken. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s Potter continued to record and tour with Peter Hammill, including being the bassist for the K-Group (from 1981‚Äì1985), and with the Tigers (in 1980) and Duncan Browne (in 1984). In 1983 he started a solo- career, and released a number of albums with mostly electronic music. In 1995 Potter produced and played the bass on the posthumous album Songs of Love and War by Duncan Browne. In 2008 Potter published the live album Live in Italy, together with many musicians like David Jackson and Tony Pagliuca (Le Orme). All Potter's solo albums were published and remastered in 2009. During the last two years of his life, Potter suffered from Pick's disease. In January 2013, Potter was admitted to University College Hospital suffering from pneumonia. He died there in the later hours of 16 January.

While Benskins has not existed as an independent company for over half a century, the brand continues to be well known in north London and Hertfordshire, through being used as a brand name on many tied houses into the 1990s, and in some cases later. History Benskins had its roots in the brewery founded in Watford by John Pope, a local miller and baker around 1693. The brewery was inherited by his second son, Daniel Pope in 1722, and passed to Daniel's sister Sarah Pope and her husband William Dyson in 1741 at his death. For the next three generations part of the brewery was inherited by a John Dyson (son, grandson, and great- grandson of Sarah Pope and William Dyson) each of whom bought out his co- heirs. When the third John Dyson died in 1867 the brewery was sold at auction to retired London hotelier Joseph Benskin and Watford draper William Bradley for ¬£34,000. Bradley soon left the partnership, and in 1870 Benskin continued alone. Upon Joseph's death in 1877, the management of the brewery passed to his widow Maria, and their second son John Pusey Benskin. His third son Thomas Benskin became a partner in 1884, bringing to the company James Panton of the Wareham Brewery in Dorset, reputed to be the first person to study scientific brewing at University College, London. Thomas' son Eric Seagrave Benskin later became a director, and Colonel William Briggs, husband of Doris Benskins was appointed to the board in 1908, latterly becoming chairman. The brewery as taken over by Benskin and Bradley in 1867 was one of the smaller Hertfordshire brewers of the time, with 42 tied houses in its estate. However over the following ninety years Benskins became predominant in the area, ultimately acquiring all other Watford breweries; Healey's in 1898, Sedgwick's in 1923, and Wells' Watford Brewery in 1951. Healey's had previously, in the months prior to its acquisition, purchased the Victoria Brewery on St Albans Road from the Chesham Brewery. Benskins rose to become the only regional brewer Hertfordshire ever produced, and during its life its estate included pubs, beer houses and off-licences not only in its home county, but as far afield as Sussex, Essex, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Kent and Greater London. The brewery remained a family business until a take-over bid was accepted from Ind Coope on 13 March 1957. In 1959 Ind Coope merged with Ansells, and Taylor Walker & Co to form Allied Breweries. At the time of the sale to Ind Coope, the Benskins estate numbered 636 pubs and hotels, and 16 off- licences.http://www.breweryhistory.com/journal/archive/110/bh-110-009.pdf The Benskins name was retained for a number of years after the sale, and brewing continued at Watford until 1972. Despite the closure of the Cannon Brewery site, and its subsequent demolition in 1979, the brand was again revived and applied to a number of pubs in the Allied estate during the early 1980s. A new beer, Benskins Best Bitter, went into production in mid-1980 as part of the relaunch, however this was brewed in Romford and bore no resemblance to any of the original Watford ales. Benskins continued to trade as a separate business unit, Ind Coope Benskins Limited, although now existing only to manage the tied estate, and maintained its head office in Watford during this time. Occupying the former Clarendon Hotel on Station Road, the hotel's original accommodation repurposed as offices whilst the former stables were converted into a new pub named after Benskins' famous logo - The Pennant (latterly The Flag (and Firkin), currently O'Neill's). Benskins Best Bitter continued to be produced in Burton-upon-Trent until it ceased production in 2002. As a result of further mergers and acquisitions over the intervening years, ownership of the Benskins trademarks currently rests with Carlsberg International AS, Denmark. Acquisitions Chronology of breweries, beer sellers and maltsters acquired by Benskins: 1895 - Crown Brewery, Hertford 1897 - Groome‚Äôs Kings Langley Brewery (Kings Langley), Kingsbury Brewery (St Albans) 1898 - Healey‚Äôs King Street Brewery (Watford), Hawkes & Co Brewery (Bishop‚Äôs Stortford), Down & Needham (Woburn Sands) 1913 - Locke & Smith‚Äôs Brewery (Berkhamsted) 1915 - Bailey‚Äôs Fox Brewery (Bishop‚Äôs Stortford), Barber‚Äôs Brewery (Aston Clinton), Taylor‚Äôs Brewery (Saffron Walden) 1920 - Pryor, Reid & Co Brewery (Hatfield) 1923 - Sedgwick's (Watford) 1927 - Roberts And Wilson‚Äôs Brewery (Ivinghoe) 1929 - Wellers Brewery (Amersham) 1951 - Wells' Watford Brewery (Watford) Beers Benskins Nut Brown Ale Bottle Label Beers brewed under the Benskins name, either by Benskins at the Watford Cannon Brewery or by Ind Coope at Burton-upon-Trent or Romford.

As of late 2012, Carlsberg UK were again producing a beer under the Benskins name, a limited availability product known as Benskins Smooth Bitter. Legacy Some pubs in the Hertfordshire and north-west London area carried Benskins branding well into the 2000s. Shown is Benskins branding on the Holly Bush in Hampstead in 2009. It had been removed by 2015. Benskins had close ties to the local football team, Watford FC. In 1921 Benskins purchased the current Vicarage Road ground and leased it to the club at a peppercorn rent. In 2001 the club purchased the ground from Punch Taverns, who had inherited the freehold as part of their acquisition of the Allied Domecq estate. In 2006 the club also purchased the freehold of the Red Lion pub opposite the ground, which had previously been part of the Benskins tied estate. The pub, notable for its external tiling advertising \\"Benskins Celebrated Watford Ale & Stout\\" still extant, re-opened briefly between 2012 and 2014 under new ownership, however it was sold on again during 2015. In September 2015 the pub was designated an Asset of Community Value by Watford Council. A number of other pubs in and around the Watford area still carry Benskins branding, such as the Estcourt Tavern and Nascot Arms in Watford. However, such examples are now increasingly rare. Of particular note is The Holly Bush pub in Hampstead, London, which displayed a number of original brewery artefacts, but was bought by Fuller's in 2010. The Benskins name lived on for a number of years in the Benskins Morris of Watford, although they themselves have now disbanded. Before demolition, the wider brewery site was used as a filming location for the \\"Heroes\\" episode of the British TV drama series The Professionals. The former Brewery House of the Cannon Brewery, built in 1775, is now home to Watford Museum. During 2010 the main part of the original brewery site was once again redeveloped after the demise of the Watford Springs swimming pool. During the construction of the Wellspring Centre for Watford Community Church, a 15-metre deep industrial well was discovered, likely to have been the brewery's primary source of water drawn from the River Colne.

There are relatively few demos on the Acorn Electron and HeadFirst PD was unusual in that it released the majority of its software for the Acorn Electron, not the more-popular BBC Micro. Indeed, several of the better HeadFirst PD demos were Electron-only. The Invader Demo and the Vortex Demo were prime examples. There are several different 'versions' of some HeadFirst PD discs, as the demos were sometimes revisited and slightly improved. The early versions of the discs were superseded. The early HeadFirst PD catalogues, for example, typically had one demo per disc.

He is currently the lead singer, rhythm guitarist and main songwriter of the band Volbeat.  Biography  Poulsen at the Summer Breeze Open Air 2007 in Dinkelsb√ºhl, Germany. Poulsen grew up in Ringsted, Denmark, which is about a from Copenhagen, in a working-class family. He has a twin sister and two older sisters, who are also twins. His parents were big fans of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and Chuck Berry. As a teenager, he got in touch with metal music like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Slayer, Whitesnake, Deep Purple, Iced Earth and Black Sabbath. At the age of 17, he moved to Copenhagen and formed his first band Dominus. Poulsen stated a major influence during this period was Chuck Schuldiner and his band Death. Dominus released four records between 1994 and 2000. The band split-up a year later as Poulsen was fed up with death metal music and the death metal scene. He wrote new songs with a more rock'n'roll approach and established Volbeat. After releasing two demos, their debut album The Strength / The Sound / The Songs reached number 18 in the Danish charts and became the first album of a Danish metal band in 20 years to enter the top 20. On 22 April 2006, Poulsen performed with some of Elvis Presley's studio musicians in Copenhagen. Volbeat's sophomore record Rock the Rebel / Metal the Devil and their third effort Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood went straight to number 1 in the Danish charts. Poulsen later showed his affinity towards Social Distortion and taking cues from a \\"new influence\\" created Volbeat's distinct sound. Poulsen's father, who was a big fan of Volbeat, died on 27 June 2008,:da:Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood shortly before the release of Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood. The song \\"Light a Way\\" from the same album was played at his funeral. A week after the death of his father Poulsen tattooed his parents' names, J√∏rn and Else, on his fingers, with a letter on each finger except the thumb. Later songs, like \\"Fallen\\" (Beyond Hell/Above Heaven) and \\"Our Loved Ones\\" (Outlaw Gentleman & Shady Ladies) have been influenced by Poulsen's father. In 2012, Poulsen did a liner note for the Relapse Records reissue of Death's 1990 album Spiritual Healing, which he considers one of his favorite albums. In 2014 Poulsen did a verse in \\"Highwayman\\", a Jimmy Webb song covered by Iced Earth on the album Plagues of Babylon. Iced Earth's cover of Highwayman was done in the format of the same song covered by country Supergroup \\"The Highwaymen\\". Poulsen sings the same verse that Johnny Cash sings in the song.

It was built as a tactical means of excluding competitors from the area, and when it opened in 1850 it was loss making. The later development of North Berwick as a resort and a golfing centre transformed the branch line. Goods train operation on the branch ceased in 1968, but the line was electrified in 1991 and now enjoys a regular interval passenger service to Edinburgh. Authorisation and construction The North British Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament in the 1844 session, to build a line from Edinburgh to Berwick (later known as Berwick-upon-Tweed. From the outset this was to be a trunk railway, connecting at Berwick with the Newcastle and Berwick Railway and onwards to the growing English railway network. A Scottish network was forming too, and the competition between the promoters of proposed lines, and the directors of authorised lines, became intense. The first main line was to run east from Edinburgh, where there was to be a terminal station at the North Bridge, to East Linton, Dunbar and Berwick. The geographical position of North Berwick, and its lack of commercial significance at the time, meant that it was not to be on the main line, although it was a Royal Burgh with a population of 1,600.W A C Smith and Paul Anderson, An Illustrated History of Edinburgh's Railways, Irwell Press, Caernarfon, 1995, However, in the frenzied atmosphere of competition, the Directors became alarmed at the possibility of rival railways entering the area, and at this early date, abstracting traffic. A line from Dalkeith to East Linton was being proposed, and it was suspected that the railway financier George Hudson, earlier an ally, was behind a move to make this part of the main route from Edinburgh in place of their own (as yet unbuilt) line. The North Berwick branch lineTo head off this threat, the Directors of the North British Railway set about getting authorisation for branch lines to several places adjacent to their main line, to pre-empt the rival incursion. In addition, North Berwick was judged to have the potential for the construction of superior residential districts for Edinburgh merchants, who might travel daily to their place of business, by train. A special shareholders' meeting held on 9 February 1846 approved four Bills to go to Parliament for branch lines; one of these swept up branches to Duns, North Berwick, Tranent and Cockenzie; estimated capital required was ¬£170,000. On 16 June 1846 the Royal Assent was granted to a North British Railway Act for the branch lines, including one to North Berwick from Drem. At North Berwick the line was to extend through the town a far as the harbour.Andrew M Hajducki, The North Berwick and Gullane Branch Lines, The Oakwood Press, Headington, 1992, John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, Contracts for construction were let in early 1847, but financial problems for the North British began to set in. Although the main line had been built, the Company had committed to building the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway, a line criticised as being nearly as long as the main line, and running through relatively sparsely populated terrain; and a number of other expensive schemes were straining the NBR's finances. The North Berwick branch was now to be completed only when money became available. The Town Council of North Berwick were demanding a high price for the land required for the continuation of the line through the town, and the NBR reviewed its plan to extend to the harbour, eventually (in November 1848) deciding to abandon that part of the branch line plan. In fact the land acquisition for the shortened line as actually built cost ¬£18,949 compared with ¬£7,083 estimated.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Remarkably, the branch was being constructed as a double line; \\"a mistake\\" according to Thomas.John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, , p. 40 In early 1849 it was reported that the earthworks for the line were substantially complete but that the permanent way was only partly laid, and the decision was taken to lift one of the (incomplete) tracks so as to finish a single line. At this stage it emerged that the remaining earthwork was a deep cutting approaching North Berwick, and in August 1849 the Directors ordered that the cutting should be formed for a single line only. Opening to a temporary terminus In order to generate some income, the Board decided to open the line as far as Williamston,Hajducki consistently spells it so, conceding on p. 16 \\"otherwise Williamstown or Williamstone\\" the estate where the terminus was located is shown as Williamston on contemporary six-inch Ordnance Survey maps gives Williamston. Quick, Smith & Anderson, Paterson and Thomas give Williamstown.Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, Six Inches to One Mile, Haddingtonshire, Sheet 2, surveyed 1853, published 1854. The location was just short of the cutting. The Board of Trade inspection, required for passenger train opening, took place on 4 August and the line opened as far as Williamston on 13 August 1849. A temporary wooden platform was provided there, and horse conveyances took passengers on to North Berwick; there were four trains daily (except Sundays). Completion Completion of the line took longer than expected, and it was not until 17 June 1850 that the line opened throughout, with an intermediate station at Dirleton;Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1 Williamston was closed on the same day. The line joined the main line some distance east of Drem station; the station itself had two platforms, with no separate bay for the branch trains that terminated there. The construction of the line had cost ¬£116,766. At some later date a separate line was provided for the branch to run independently to the station. The signalling system on the single line branch was by telegraph order. Traffic on the branch was not heavy, and the line made a loss. The Directors had promoted numerous lines at the time with the object of keeping other railways out of the area. This was the so-called \\"protection\\" policy, but a later shareholders' committee expressed regret that the Directors had undertaken the building of the line. Efforts were made to encourage the high class residential traffic that had been originally contemplated, by offering very attractive season ticket rates to the first occupiers of new houses near the line. Horse traction Cost savings were attempted when a vehicle built for horse traction on the Leith branch of the Dalkeith line was tried on the North Berwick line. A pathway in the centre of the track had to be made for the horse, at a cost of ¬£65. The passenger service was reduced to two return trips daily by the horse-drawn vehicle (referred to as \\"the Dandy\\"), and the new arrangement started on 1 November 1856, as the winter traffic was light. The goods traffic on the branch was handled by the main line pick-up goods train, which now travelled up and down the branch as well; this disrupted and extended onward goods transits on the main line. John Scott, an Edinburgh solicitor raised a case against the North British Railway that he had been induced to take up residence in North Berwick and that the discontinuance of the steam-operated service was prejudicial to his rights. He claimed ¬£5,000 in damages from the NBR. His case was eventually thrown out, but protracted legal proceedings provided much entertainment for readers of the newspapers of the area. The horse operated service evidently did not achieve the savings the company had hoped for, and from 1 May 1857 a steam operated service of four daily mixed trains was resumed. The Dandy car was never used on the branch again, and about 1859 it was sold to the Carlisle and Silloth Bay Railway who used it on the Silloth branch. It is now preserved at the National Railway Museum in York.http://www.nrm.org.uk/OurCollection/LocomotivesAndRollingStock/CollectionItem.aspx?objid=1975-7058 Revived fortunes About 1860 the train staff and ticket system of signalling control was introduced on the branch. On the North Berwick branch subsequently a small 0-4-2 well-tank locomotive, no 20, was the regular motive power. From about 1875 golf became of considerable popularity and began to bring traffic to the line, and in the season regular through trains from Edinburgh were put on. A ticket platform was erected just short of North Berwick station. North Berwick became a popular resort, and many well-to-do families took houses there for the summer season; the breadwinner of the family travelled daily to a place of business in Edinburgh or Glasgow and the family remained in the resort. In the late Victorian and Edwardian era, golf also became increasingly popular, and the practice of travelling some distance for a game became established. The station facilities at North Berwick were upgraded in March 1894. The Lothian Coast Express The North British Railway put on a train service named The Lothian Coast Express. It ran from 12 June 1912 Hajducki; Ross says 3 June on p. 202, as do Smith & Anderson on p. 80. to August of that year. It ran in the afternoon from Glasgow to Dunbar, via Edinburgh Waverley. Ross states that the train ran through Waverley without stopping there, the only scheduled passenger train to do so.Ross; but Paterson gives Edinburgh calling times in both directions. They may be referring to different time periods. The train conveyed a Gullane portion, detached at Longniddry and a North Berwick portion, detached at Drem, and it conveyed a refreshment car. The return service left Dunbar in the morning and picked up the North Berwick and Gullane portions at Drem and Longniddry, and it served breakfast. The train was said to have been the first British named train to carry a headboard with the train name.Hajducki p. 87 The Lothian Coast Express was suspended during World War I but it was reinstated in 1919. From 1923 In 1923 the North British Railway was \\"grouped\\" under the Railways Act 1921, becoming a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). From 1923 road competition started; at first it was limited but by the 1930s it was a serious alternative to the railway branch line. From 1924 a through sleeping car ran from London to North Berwick, detached from the main (Edinburgh) train at Drem. It ran in the summer season only, and in later years it was reduced to Friday northwards and Sunday southwards. A single first class sleeping car vehicle was used. The service ceased in 1939. In an attempt to reduce costs, the LNER introduced Sentinel steam railcars on the North Berwick branch. Trials were carried out in 1928 and from 1930 the railcars regularly appeared on the branch. They were not an unqualified success, but they continued operating part of the passenger service, running through from North Berwick to Edinburgh, until the late 1930s. The Lothian Coast Express continued running, but changing business patterns meant that fewer business people wished to use the train, and 1934 was the last season in which it ran. Decline of local traffic Goods traffic declined substantially in the period to 1939 as road transport became the normal means of transport for agricultural produce. The passenger service on the branch was substantially reduced during World War II and not much enhanced after 1945. Dirleton station was always isolated, and its use by a few passengers declined too, and on 1 February 1954 the station as closed to passengers. Modernisation and economies The LNER had been nationalised in 1948, and British Railways Scottish Region was the organisational unit in control. The branch was loss-making, and in attempt to revive it, British Railways implemented some modernisation schemes in the Edinburgh area, and diesel multiple unit trains were introduced on the branch passenger services from 23 July 1956, when a demonstration run took place, and from 3 February 1958 a recast diesel operated service ran on a regular interval basis, with all trains running to Edinburgh Waverley and some continuing to Corstorphine. Some steam working continued for the time being. Meanwhile, the goods business had collapsed, and it was discontinued from 1 January 1968, and the line was reduced to a single line without siding or loop facilities. In 1968 British Railways proposed complete closure of the branch on the ground that it was loss-making, but the Minister of Transport refused consent, and the line continued in use. However further economies had to be made, and this included a substantial reduction in the train service pattern; this was introduced from 4 January 1970. In January 1985 the traditional station buildings were demolished, having become unsafe, and a new simple shelter was erected. The single platform was shortened by 50 yards. Electrification In October 1990 the Scottish section of the East Coast Main Line was electrified, and shortly before the day of switching on the power, agreement was reached between British Rail and Lothian Regional Council to share the cost of electrifying the North Berwick branch, at a cost of ¬£1.3 million. The overhead line equipment was energised on 18 May 1991. Finding rolling stock for the service was not easy, and after some research five units of class 305/2, built in 1960 and employed up until then in the London commuter area, were obtained. Internal layout changes were made and through corridor connections fitted. The full electric train service started operation on 8 July 1991. Although the old electric multiple unit trains suffered reliability problems, and lacked air conditioning, their high-density seating layout abolished the overcrowding that had been experienced at peak times, and they proved surprisingly popular. Topography Gradients Leaving Drem Junction, the line falls at 1 in 110 for nearly half a mile, then becoming level. Next it climbs at 1 in 93 for a mile, then falling at 1 in 2348 for 1¬Ω miles, finally falling at 1 in 66 for a mile to North Berwick.

Rolling stock  The North Berwick branch has been served by a variety of rolling stock over its life. Steam locomotives were typically tank engines, North British Railway 4-4-0T, 0-4-4T and 4-4-2T successively being the norm. By the end of regular steam passenger service on the branch in 1958, LNER Class V1/V3 2-6-2T engines were the usual power. Despite there being no turntable, tender engines were also used on both passenger and goods traffic, mainly 4-4-0s and 0-6-0s. Excursion traffic very occasionally brought larger engines such as K3 Class 2-6-0s. LNER steam railcars were tried in the late 1920s and '30s, with limited success. Clayton Type 1 diesel locomotives operated the branch goods service in its final years, but subsequently visits by diesel locomotive have been confined to occasional engineering trains. Early diesel multiple units (DMUs) used on the line from 1958 onwards were Class 100 and Class 101. Subsequently, many different types of DMU appeared on the line, including Class 104, Class 105, Class 107, Class 108 and Class 120. In 1987 new Class 150 Sprinter DMUs took over some services. Upon electrification by British Rail in 1991, five thirty-year-old 305 electric multiple units (EMUs) were refurbished for the line, having been made redundant from London Liverpool Street suburban services. In their later years these trains became unreliable and deputisation by diesel units (including equally elderly Class 117s) was not uncommon. Prior to privatisation, it was not unknown for InterCity 125 diesel-electric units to operate to North Berwick if no other train was available. Most services were operated using five Class 322 4-car EMUs. These trains were built in 1990 for use on Stansted Express services, but were displaced from these services by 2001 when they were leased to ScotRail to allow withdrawal of the elderly Class 305s. They were occasionally assisted by Class 318s especially during the half-hourly services on Saturdays. Their lease expired in mid-2004 and the 322s returned to England, prompting a search for suitable replacement stock. No modern EMUs were available at the time, and the line reverted to locomotive haulage for a time, using Class 90 electric locomotives hired from EWS and former Virgin Trains West Coast Mark 3 coaches, with each set incorporating a DVT to allow push-pull operation. In mid-2005 the Class 322 units became available again, refurbished for permanent use by First ScotRail. Apart from the Class 322s, diesel units of Classes 156, 158 and 170 also operated some services, mainly on Saturdays when there were not enough EMUs to maintain a half-hour frequency throughout the day. In June 2011, Class 380s began operating the North Berwick line, phasing out all Class 322s which were all returned to England. As of summer 2019, Class 385 EMUs have almost totally supplanted the Class 380s, operating the North Berwick to Edinburgh Waverley service via Drem. A half-hour service runs on Saturdays until early evening when an hourly service (as operated on weekdays and Sundays) resumes.

After their initial classification as EP 2 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K√∂niglich Bayerische Staats- Eisenbahnen), they were redesignated as E 32s from 1927 to 1968 in the DRG's numbering plan and, later in the DB classification scheme. In their final years, post-1968, they were given the EDV-compatible classification of 132. Characteristic of the E 32 was its short length and link drive (Stangenantrieb).  History  Cab of an E 32 in the Nuremberg Transport Museum Nuremberg The Bavarian Group Administration of the Deutsche Reichsbahn procured 29 E 32 electric locomotives between 1924 and 1926-29 for light passenger train duties. To begin with they still carried their Bavarian classification of EP2 20 006 to 034, before they were allocated to DRG Class E 32. Numbers 01 to 05 were unused, because they had already been allocated to the Bavarian EP 1 (later DRG Class E 62). The E 32s were employed on all the Upper Bavarian lines. In 1932 the top speed on eight of the engines was raised from 75 to 90 km/h after they had been given new gear transmissions. These eight machines were then given the numbers E 32 101 to 108 (E32.1).  Deutsche Bundesbahn  24 engines were taken over by the Deutsche Bundesbahn after the Second World War, five had had to be written off as war losses. In 1968 22 machines were renumbered ito the EDP system as Class 132. Their service ended on 1 August 1972, when the last eight 132s were retired.  Museum  E 32 27 has been preserved.

He is currently the CEO of SUSMAN & Associates, an economic, financial and management consulting firm headquartered in Nigeria. Shamsuddeen was the Minister of National Planning between January 2009 to September 2013. He was also the Finance Minister of Nigeria between June 2007 and January 2009. He was responsible for the development of Nigeria's long- term development strategy, Nigeria Vision 2020 and the National Integrated Infrastructure Master Plan. During his tenure as the Minister of Finance and National Planning, he was chairman of the Nigerian National Economic Management Team. Shamduddeen represented Nigeria as a Governor on the Governing Boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He was a Member of the Federal Executive Council, National Economic Council and the National Council on Privatization. Usman was the first Nigerian Minister to publicly declare his assets before assuming office as a public officer, an act considered as a sign of accountability and transparency in a country noted for its high levels of corruption. Education and personal life Shamsuddeen Usman was born to a family living in Warure Quarters of Kano State. His Father, an Islamic scholar, died when he was about six years old. He began his education at Dandago Primary School. After a secondary school education at the prestigious Government College Keffi and King's College, Lagos, he gained a BSc. in Economics from Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Nigeria. He later won a National scholarship to study for his MSc. and PhD at the London School of Economics and Political Science between 1977 and 1980. His PhD was on \\"Tax Incentives and Investment in the Nigerian Oil Industry\\".During his first two years at the London School of Economics, he served as a teaching assistant for the final year class in Public Finance. Work life From 1974 to 1976, Usman worked as the Planning Officer for the Kano State Ministry of Economic Planning. He taught Economic Analysis and Public Finance to students in Ahmadu Bello University, Bayero University Kano and University of Jos between 1976 and 1981. He was a controller at the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) and then served as the director of budget/ special economic adviser to the Kano State Government between 1981 and 1983. Usman was then appointed the general manager of NAL Merchant Bank (currently Sterling Bank). Impact of privatisation and commercialisation on Nigerian economy From 1989 to 1991 Usman served as the pioneer director general of The Technical Committee of Privatisation and Commercialisation, now the Bureau of Public Enterprises and was responsible for the Phase I programme with the task to reform public enterprises, as an integral and critical component of the International Monetary Fund-led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), which was started in 1986. Under his supervision, about 88 public enterprises were either fully or partially privatised without any foreign technical assistance. The programme succeeded in relieving the government of the huge and growing burden of financing public enterprises, minimised the overstretching of government's managerial capacity through a redefinition of the role of the supervising ministries, created a large body of shareholders and deepened and broadened the Nigerian Capital Market to the position of being the most developed in black Africa. The market capitalisation of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) through which the shares were sold has grown from N8.9 billion in 1987 (before privatisation) to N65.5 billion in 1994 (after the Phase-I). The catalytic effect of the volume of shares released into the market via the privatisation exercise cannot be over emphasised. The TCPC became the current Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in 1993. In summary, the Phase-I of the privatisation has given the Nigerian economy some benefits, like: *Performance of the privatised enterprises so far has led to a considerable increase in the volume of corporate taxes accruing to the national treasury. *The sale of shares and assets realised over N3.7 billion as gross privatisation proceeds from the privatisation of 55 enterprises whose total original investment according to the records of the Ministry of Financed Incorporated (MOFI) was N652 million. This represents less than 2% of the total value of the Federal Government's investments as at 30 November 1990 which stood at N36 billion. *Privatisation has massively expanded personal share ownership in Nigeria. *By reducing the reliance of public enterprises on the government for finance, the programme of privatisation has encouraged new investments in the enterprises concerned. * The new operational autonomy of these enterprises and their liberation from political interference in day-to-day management has improved the internal efficiency of these enterprises allowing them to liberalise their purchasing as well as rationalise labour practices. * Flotation of shares of privatised enterprises have greatly stimulated the rapid growth of the Nigerian Capital Market and helped to deepen and broaden it. Banking Usman was head-hunted to become the executive director of United Bank for Africa in charge of the International and Investments Sector, this included direct supervision of the New York Branch and due to his strong performance, their biggest rival at the time, Union Bank of Nigeria appointed him to become their executive director and Head of Corporate and International Banking. His time at Union Bank was short-lived as NAL Merchant Bank recruited him to become their managing director and chief executive officer, a post that he kept for over five years. He was also a member of the Committee on Vision 2010. At the return to democracy in Nigeria in 1999, Usman was appointed as the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria in charge of Domestic Monetary and Banking Policy, later modified to Financial Sector Surveillance. He was also responsible for heading Project Eagles, the Central Bank of Nigeria's reform programme, responsible for converting the organisation into one of the most efficient, effective and goal-focused institutions in Nigeria. From January 2004 to June 2007 he was the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria in charge of the Operations Directorate. From 2005, he served as chairman and then alternate chairman of the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company Limited (NSPMC). In this role, he oversaw the introduction of N500 and N1000 notes and the reorganisation of the Mint into a more profitable company with greater operating efficiency. He has served as the chairman of the Abuja Stock Exchange, Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM) and Financial Institutions Training Centre. Usman has also served as a president of the Nigerian Economic Society and is a fellow of the Society. He is also a board member of the African Economic Research Consortium and the African Export-Import Bank. Economy and finance Usman was appointed as the Minister of Finance of Nigeria from May 2007 to January 2009. In this role, he served as the head of the Economic Management Team and as the vice chairman of the National Council on Privatisation. Usman introduced a system of performance-based budgeting and pursued various economic reforms such as reducing the average Nigerian Ports Clearing time from approximately 2 months to approximately 14 days during his tenure; increasing the capitalization, trust and effectiveness of the insurance sector together with pursuing the implementation of the Insurance Act; cancellation of illegal waivers and concessions which led to revenue leakages of over $2 billion; reducing Nigeria's external debt; and easing customs charges and capital market charges for operators to promote a vibrant and hassle-free environment for investment in the economy. In times leading to the presentation of the government's budget by the President (Umaru Musa Yar'Adua) to the National Assembly, Usman did not enjoy a cordial relationship with a few Members of the Senate and House of Assembly as both, on all occasions during the preparation of the budget, were pushing for increased government spending against Usman's wishes, particularly as the Nation was suffering from dwindling oil revenues. Usman claimed the reason for this is that the Economy of Nigeria lacked the capacity to take this increased spending, given its deflated revenue base and in order to control inflation and curtail corruption and improper implementation as in the Power Sector during the Obasanjo administration; this should be avoided. Usman blamed the low level of execution of the 2008 budget partly to the delays caused by the National Assembly in approving the Budget, a statement that the Members of the National Assembly were very unhappy with. In preparing the 2007 (appropriation), 2008, 2008 (appropriation) and 2009 budgets, Usman also introduced a system of budgeting based on Medium Term Development Plans as opposed to misguided annual budgeting which showed coherency with respect to national development plans in succeeding years, as was done in the past. In a similar manner to Trevor Manuel, the previous Finance Minister of South Africa, Usman was appointed as the minister/deputy chairman of the National Planning Commission of Nigeria and as the chairman of the Steering Committee on Nigeria Vision 2020 in January 2009. In this role, he is responsible for Economic and Developmental Strategy of the Nation through the formulation of a Medium Term National Plan/Policy Framework, a Long-Term National Plan (Nigeria Vision 2020) and working with the Ministry of Finance to set the overall objectives of the Annual Budget (Short-Term Plan). He is also responsible for supervising the Monitoring and Implementation of these National Development Plans, the European Development Fund (EDF) Country Strategy Paper (CSP) and the National Indicative Programme (NIP). As the Minister of National Planning, he also oversees the National Bureau of Statistics, the Centre for Management and Development and the Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research (NISER). He was mentioned as one of the major individuals that made a tremendous impact in Nigerian economy and their contributions at the moment will help alleviate the current economic recession by Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. He is also a member of the Presidential Steering Committee on the global financial crisis. Minister of National Planning (January 2009 to September 2013) As Minister of National Planning, Usman: * Created the Nigeria Vision 2020 document with input from a wide variety of stakeholders (e.g. Youth, States, Women, Engineers, People with Disabilities) * National Strategy for the Development of Statistics which is to generate data for national planning * Developed a national framework which is to be used for the evaluation of Ministries, Departments and Agencies' performance * An evaluation of the 7-point agenda and other government policies * Four-year implementation plan for the Vision 2020 document * A medium-term expenditure framework on which the national budget is based Nigeria Sovereign Wealth Fund In the years preceding 2008, Nigeria benefitted from the surge in oil prices, which allowed the government to build up excess reserves and increase public expenditure. However, Usman had identified that oil price volatility posed very high risks to growth in Nigeria's oil-dependent economy, and as such pushed for the establishment of a Sovereign Wealth Fund, which will serve as a long-term saving fund for future generations and also as a development fund for socio- economic projects It was planned to be similar to the Government Pension Fund of Norway. Normally, excess revenue (i.e. actual revenue less budgeted revenue) was saved in the excess crude account, to prevent overheating the economy, though as there is no legal arrangement for the management of the excess crude account, and no mandate for it to be used as a future generations fund, a Sovereign Wealth Fund was necessary to enhance efficiency in the management of the country's reserves. Usman constituted a Presidential Technical Committee on the Establishment of the Nigeria Sovereign Wealth Fund, which submitted its report to the National Economic Council and the President. However, due to Usman's redeployment to the Ministry of National Planning, efforts to establish the Sovereign Wealth Fund have been put on hold. Re- nomination: battle with the Mafia and local politicians Following the dissolution of the cabinet by Acting President, Goodluck Jonathan, Usman was one of nine out of a total of 42 ministers re-nominated to serve as a government Minister in the new cabinet. This was due to his neutrality on political issues and good working relationship with the Acting President. Usman's re-nomination was not viewed favorably by members of the Kano State PDP chapter, as they perceived Usman to be a technocrat and not a politician, and as such would not serve the self-interests of the People's Democratic Party in Kano State. This led to political lobbying from several interest groups to prevent his nomination. As a result, the Presidency instructed the Senate to delay his screening, and by the next morning, the local newspapers were reporting that he had been dropped as a Minister due to political interests against his appointment as a Technocrat. However, on the same morning of the newspaper reports, Usman was the first to be screened by the Senate where he answered a variety of questions on the economy, and answered questions on his performance as a Minister of Finance and National Planning. It was here where he made his famous statements on his battles with the economic mafia in Nigeria who sabotage the government's revenue generating ability. Philanthropy Usman is the chairman and one of the founding members of the Kano Peace and Development Initiative (KAPEDI), a group of concerned indigenes of Kano State individuals driven to resuscitate the economic activity of Kano State especially after the religious conflict in 2004. He also started Gidauniyar Alheri, an NGO in the Garangamawa area of Kano city that provides human resource development training to youth in Nigeria, and particularly in Kano State. OICI has trained some of their staff in microenterprise development, and they now assist in providing microenterprise training to OICI's Nigeria JOBS beneficiaries. The NGO also comprises The Gidauniyar Alheri Enterprise and Development Centre, Gidauniya Alheri Microfinance Bank Limited and a community hospital. It also plays a huge role in microcredit schemes particularly to women in the local area; IT training and extra-tuition for youths in the local area.

The underlying technology included: * Cloud File System, a virtual file system specifically designed to handle millions of users and billions of files in a single global namespace with data consistency. * Cloud Storage Network which consists of nine globally dispersed data centers. Customers can locate data close to users and to choose redundancy levels by replicating data to two, three, or more data centers. * Cloud NAS Gateway software which installs on Windows or Linux servers and provides access to the Nirvanix cloud storage services. Storage was accessible via HTTP, using the Nirvanix Web Services application programming interface based on Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) or the Nirvanix CloudNAS gateway software. Scott Genereux was appointed president and CEO of Nirvanix in November 2010, replacing Jim Zierick. Since then the company overhauled its management team and signed a number of partners, including a 5-year OEM agreement with IBM. Nirvanix has also deployed petabyte-scale clouds at Cerner, USC, and others. In December 2012 Genereux left to join Oracle Corporation, and was replaced by Dru Borden, who was then replaced by Debra Chrapaty in March 2013. Despite the earlier agreement, IBM acquired SoftLayer in June 2013 and started a competitor IBM Cloud Services Division. Closure On September 16, 2013 Nirvanix notified customers that they had until September 30, 2013 to move their data off of the service at which point Nirvanix would shut down. By September 28, 2013, the company deactivated its website and replaced it with a statement that included customer support details. Nirvanix said an IBM team could assist customers with transferring their data from the Nirvanix infrastructure. The company filed for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 1, 2013, which was approved on October 8. On December 4, 2013, Oracle issued an announcement that they had acquired select intellectual property of Nirvanix, as well as key engineering resources.

Its characteristic two-inch- wide circular discs overlap like scale armor, creating a flexible vest that allows a good range of motion and is intended to absorb a high number of hits compared with other military body armor. The discs are composed of silicon carbide ceramic matrices and laminates, much like the larger ceramic plates in other types of bullet resistant vests. The armor was c. 2007 available in one basic protection level: Dragon Skin Extreme (formerly SOV-2000), which until 2007 was certified to comply with the NIJ 2005 Interim Requirements as a Level III armor system. Dragon Skin has been worn by some civilian contractors in Iraq, some special operations forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, some SWAT teams, nine generals in Afghanistan, bodyguards tasked with protecting generals, and U.S. Secret Service personnel. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has also purchased Dragon Skin. In 2020, there are no known users of the armor, although sets can be found on various online retail sites, and one of the creators has gone on to create a new company, Stealth Armor Systems.  Structure  Dragon Skin armor is made of an overlapping series of high tensile strength ceramic discs encased in a fiber glass textile. Different layout configurations with variations in coverage are available. Dragon Skin Extreme is made of overlapping approximately √ó ceramic discs encased in a fabric cover. In evaluating the Dragon Skin system, it is important to note that while the external measurements of the Dragon Skin panel are √ó , the area of level III coverage provided by the encased ceramic discs is √ó ; the fabric edges are not intended to provide ballistic protection. Weight of the Dragon Skin Extreme armor providing √ó of level III protection was approximately .  Testing   Television  In a test for the History Channel's military show, Mail Call, the vest repelled nine rounds of steel-core ammunition from an AK-47 full automatic and 35 rounds of 9√ó19mm from a Heckler & Koch MP5A3, all fired into a 10-by-12-inch area on the vest. On Test Lab, also on the History Channel, the vest withstood 120 rounds fired from a Type 56 (7.62√ó39mm) rifle and Heckler & Koch MP5 (9√ó19mm). In another demonstration on the Discovery Channel series Future Weapons, a Dragon Skin vest withstood numerous rounds (including steel core rounds) from an AK-47, a Heckler & Koch MP5SD, an M4 carbine (5.56√ó45mm), and a point-blank detonation of an M67 grenade. While the vest was heavily damaged (mainly by the grenade), there was no penetration of the armor. In 2007, NBC News had independent ballistics testing conducted of Dragon Skin versus Interceptor body armor. Retired four- star general Wayne A. Downing observed the tests and concluded that although the number of trials performed was limited, the Dragon Skin armor performed significantly better. NBC also interviewed retired USMC Colonel James Magee, who was one developers of the Army‚Äôs then-current body armor, Interceptor. \\"Dragon Skin is the best out there, hands down. It's better than the Interceptor. It is state of the art. In some cases, it‚Äôs two steps ahead of anything I‚Äôve ever seen.\\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18720550/ns/nbc_nightly_news_with_brian_williams- nbc_news_investigates/t/are-us-soldiers-wearing-best-body-armor/ In light of the May 2007 media investigations, senators Hillary Clinton and Jim Webb requested that Comptroller General of the United States David M. Walker initiate a Government Accountability Office investigation into the army's body armor systems. After being confronted with conflicting information by lawmakers who questioned the NBC test results and provided Army-supplied data of vest failures from a May 2006 test, the technical expert solicited by NBC to certify its test backed away from his staunch defense of Dragon Skin and stated that the vests \\"weren't ready for prime time\\". It was also featured on Time Warp on the Discovery Channel.  Law enforcement  In Fresno, California, a police department commissioned the purchase of Dragon Skin for its officers after a vest stopped all the bullets fired during a test, including .308 rounds from a rifle and 30 rounds from a 9mm MP5 fired from five feet away. The armor also stopped 40 rounds of PS-M1943 mild steel-core bullets from an AK-47 along with 200 9 mm full metal jacket bullet fired from a submachine gun.  Military testing  Dragon Skin became the subject of controversy with the U.S. Army over testing it against its Interceptor body armor. The Army claimed Pinnacle's body armor was not proven to be effective. In test runs for the Air Force there were multiple failures to meet the claimed level of protection. This coupled with poor quality control (over 200 of the 380 vests delivered to USAF OSI were recalled due to improperly manufactured armor disks) and accusations of fraudulent claims of official NIJ rating which Pinnacle had not actually obtained at the time of purchase led to the termination of the USAF contract. Pinnacle attempted to appeal this decision, but courts found in favor of the USAF. On April 26, 2006 Pinnacle Armor issued a press release to address these claims and a product recall instigated by the United States Navy. The company stated that although vests were returned due to a manufacturing issue, a test on the Dragon Skin Level III armor was conducted by the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations at Aberdeen Proving Ground in February 2006, which concluded that it \\"did not fail any written contract specifications\\" set forth by the Air Force, which was further stated by Pinnacle Armor to require high ballistic performance due to the hostile environments in which AFOSI operates. Weapon review website Defense Review also published an article similarly dissenting, noting that in their test and review of the Dragon Skin armor, they had found that it was \\"significantly superior in every combat-relevant way to U.S. Army PEO Soldier's and U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center (NSC)/Soldier Systems Center's Interceptor Body Armor\\". The Pentagon stated that the test results were classified and neither side could agree to terms on another, more comprehensive test. The Army wanted to hold and inspect the vests for 1‚Äì2 weeks before shooting at them, and Pinnacle wanted them shot at right away from out of the box because they said they feared the Army tampering with them in order to save their currently cheaper body armor program. On May 19, 2006 it was announced that the dispute had been resolved and the vests were going to be retested again by the Army to clear the dispute. On May 20, 2006 it was announced by The Washington Post (and other newspapers) in an article titled \\"Potential Advance in Body Armor Fails Tests\\" that the Dragon Skin vests had failed the retest according to their anonymous source. Official results of these tests were classified at the time but have since been released by the Army. On June 6, 2006 in comments posted on an online discussion forum, Karl Masters, director of engineering for Program Manager - Soldier Equipment, said he recently supervised the retest and commented on it. \\"I was recently tasked by the army to conduct the test of the 30 Dragon Skin SOV-3000 level IV body armor purchased for T&E; [tests and evaluation],\\" Masters wrote. \\"My day job is acting product manager for Interceptor Body Armor. I'm under a gag order until the test results make it up the chain. I will, however, offer an enlightened and informed recommendation to anyone considering purchasing an SOV-3000 Dragon Skin‚Äîdon't. I do not recommend this design for use in an AOR with a 7.62√ó54R AP threat and an ambient temperature that could range to 49¬∞C (120 F). I do, however, highly recommend this system for use by insurgents...\\" In response to these claims, Pinnacle Armor released a press release on June 30, 2006. Official results of these tests are classified. According to the Army, the vests failed because the extreme temperature tests caused the discs to dislodge, thus rendering the vest ineffective. Pinnacle Armor affirms that their products can withstand environmental tests in accordance with military standards, as does testing by the Aberdeen Test Center. In response to claims made by several U.S. senators, Dragon Skin and special interest groups, on Monday, May 21, 2007, the Army held a press conference where they released the results of the tests they claimed Dragon Skin failed.Sgt.

In April 2008 one of the Dragon Skin vests, with a serial number that identifies it as one of 30 vests bought by the Department of Defense for U.S. Army for testing in 2006, was listed and later bought from eBay. The seller, David Bronson, allegedly was connected to a U.S. Army testing facility. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the U.S. Department of Justice, and the F.B.I. are investigating the matter as of May 2008. The buyer described the vest as having been shot at least 20 times, with not a single through-penetration. U.S. Army bans privately purchased body armor On March 30, 2006 the Army banned all privately purchased commercial body armor in theater. Army officials told the Associated Press that the ban order was prompted by concerns that soldiers or their families were buying inadequate or untested commercial armor from private companies. The Army ban refers specifically to Pinnacle's Dragon Skin armor saying that the company advertising implies that Dragon Skin \\"is superior in performance\\" to the Interceptor Body Armor the military issues to soldiers. The Marine Corps has not issued a similar directive, but Marines are \\"encouraged to wear Marine Corps-issued body armor since this armor has been tested to meet fleet standards.\\" NBC News learned that well after the Army ban select elite forces assigned to protect generals and VIPs in Iraq and Afghanistan wore Dragon Skin. General Peter W. Chiarelli made a statement that, \\"he never wore Dragon Skin but that some members of his staff did wear a lighter version of the banned armor on certain limited occasions, despite the Army ban.\\" Chris Kyle stated in his book American Sniper that he wore Dragon Skin body armor after his third deployment which he received from his wife's parents as a gift. H.P. White Labs conducted tests on Dragon Skin in May 2006. Even under normal conditions model SOV 3000 Dragon Skin failed to stop the second impact of M2AP. Then when the other tests were run, SOV 3000 failed multiple times, with the exception of the Salt Water test.  Certification and subsequent decertification  In an interview with KSEE 24 News, an NBC affiliate, on November 14 and 16, 2006, Pinnacle Armor detailed the five-year process that the NIJ and Pinnacle Armor went through to establish a test protocol and procedure for flexible rifle defeating armor, and then pass it for the certification. and Retrieved on 2006-11-18 On December 20, 2006, Pinnacle Armor said that they received the official letter from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) that they had passed the Level III tests, and that Dragon Skin SOV-2000 was now certified for Level III protection. and and and The Air Force, which ordered the Dragon Skin vests partially based on claims they were NIJ certified at a time when they were not, has opened a criminal investigation into the firm Pinnacle Armor over allegations that it had fraudulently placed a label on their Dragon Skin armor improperly stating that it had been certified to a ballistic level it had not yet been. Murray Neal, the Pinnacle Armor chief executive, claimed that he was given verbal authorization by the NIJ to label the vests although he did not have written authorization. On August 3, 2007, the Department of Justice announced that the NIJ had reviewed evidence provided by the body armor manufacturer and had determined that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that the body armor model would maintain its ballistic performance over its six-year declared warranty period. Because of this, Dragon Skin was found to not be in compliance with the NIJ's testing program and has been removed from the NIJ's list of bullet-resistant body armor models that satisfy its requirements. Pinnacle CEO Murray Neal responded that this move was unprecedented, political, and not about the quality of the vests because they were not saying they have failed any ballistics tests. He stated it is about a dispute with the paperwork to deal with a warranty issue instead, in which the warranty period of Dragon Skin is longer than that of most other commercial vests. After passing tests at United States Test Laboratory On August 20, 2007, at the United States Test Laboratory in Wichita, Kansas, nine Dragon Skin SOV-2000 (Level III) body armor panels were retested, for the purpose of validating Pinnacle Armor's six-year warranty. The panels tested were between 5.7 years old and 6.8 years old. All items met the NIJ Level III ballistic protection, confirming Pinnacle Armor's six-year warranty for full ballistic protection.\\"Dragon Skin Passes Again: NIJ-Certified Lab Test Validates 6-Year Warranty\\". Defense Review. Pinnacle resubmitted the SOV-2000 vest to the NIJ for certification based on this successful testing, but this application was rejected because the test had not been properly documented. In November 2007, Pinnacle sued to force the NIJ to recertify the SOV-2000 vest; their case was found to be without merit and summarily dismissed in November 2013.http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020131105500.xml/PINNACLE%20ARMOR,%20INC.%20v.%20U.S.  References  External links *Dragon Skin at Pinnacle Armor *U.S. Army's Program Executive Office Soldier *Official results of the Army's Dragon Skin test. *Dragonskin.com Body armor ","title":"Dragon Skin"},{"id":"18890099","text":"Marloes Fellinger (born April 18, 1982 in Naarden) is a Dutch softball player, who represents the Dutch national team in international competitions.Athlete biography: Marloes Fellinger, beijing2008.cn, ret: Aug 16, 2008 Fellinger played softball for Run '71 Oldenzaal until 2002.

In 1965, the first settlement of London's Nepalese community was made at 145 Whitfield Street in Camden. A commemorative plaque now stands on the site. Demographics The 2001 UK Census recorded 5,943 Nepali-born people were residing in the UK. In 2008, the president of the Himalayan Yeti Nepalese Association was reporting as estimating that up to 50,000 Nepalese might be living in the UK. The 2011 UK Census recorded 48,497 people born in Nepal living in England, 1,011 in Wales, 1,268 in Scotland and 105 in Northern Ireland. Office for National Statistics estimates suggest that 62,000 Nepalese-born people were resident in the UK in 2016. At the time of the 2011 census, the regions with the largest Nepalese-born populations were London and South East England, with 19,051 and 19,111 people respectively. Of the 49,508 Nepalese-born in England and Wales, 56 per cent stated that they were Hindus, 25.9 per cent Buddhists and 3.8 per cent Christians. 1.7 per cent stated that they did not have a religion and a small number specified other religions. 11.8 per cent did not provide an answer to the religion question. 52.9 per cent of the Nepalese-born population of England and Wales had arrived during the period 2007 to 2011, 34.6 per cent between 2001 and 2006, 11.4 per cent between 1981 and 2000, and 1.1 per cent prior to 1981. Employment , 3,430 Gurkhas were serving in the British Army. According to the 2001 UK census, 34.8 per cent of Nepalese-born people in London were working in hotels or restaurants, 15.7 per cent in real estate and renting, 15.3 per cent in wholesale and retail, 9.6 per cent in health and social care.

It was served by the Aberlady, Gullane and North Berwick railway. This line diverged from the North British Railway Main Line at Aberlady Junction, east of the current Longniddry station. History Opened on 1 April 1898 as the terminus of the Aberlady, Gullane and North Berwick Railway when they opened the line between here and Aberlady junction (on the North British Railway between and ).Butt (1995), page 111Grant (2017), page 5 The line was intended to reach and thereby provide a route to North Berwick, but this section was never constructed and Gullane remained as the terminus. The station had one platform on the north side of a loop that allowed the ending to run around, there were three sidings behind the platform forming a goods yard able to accommodate most types of goods including live stock, it was equipped with a two ton crane. There was an engine shed and a signal box.The Railway Clearing House (1970), page 245 The line and station were absorbed by the North British Railway on 6 August 1900. Then station passed on to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) during the Grouping of 1923. That company then withdrew passenger services nine years later, although the line was still open to freight until 1964. The station building was used as by the LNER as a camping apartment from 1935.McRae (1997), page 13 The Scottish Region continued this use of the buildings, sometimes marketed as Camping Cottages in the 1950s and up to the line closing in 1964.McRae (1998), pages 33 & 34 Despite being closed the station had been the location of a Camping coach from 1956 to 1964.McRae (1998), page 28 The site today The houses of Muirfeld Drive and Muirfield Station are built on the old site of Gullane railway station. A railway hotel, the Marine, was built in 1900 and was the main building of the Scottish Fire Service training school. This was closed in March 2015 and converted to housing.

W. Hornung, and features the gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, and his companion and biographer, Bunny Manders. The story was published in March 1905 by Collier's Weekly in New York, and in April 1905 by Pall Mall Magazine in London.Rowland, page 282 It was also included as the fourth story in the collection A Thief in the Night, published by Chatto & Windus in London, and Charles Scribner's Sons in New York, both in 1905.Rowland, page 280. Plot Raffles, who has lately been visiting Bunny very often, tells Bunny about a small society of four crime experts, who call themselves the Criminologists. They take an interest in a number of crimes, especially the series of London society robberies. Raffles and Bunny are invited to join them dinner at the house of club president Lord Thornaby, ostensibly to discuss the potential of crime in sport (such as gambling and throwing matches), as Raffles is a well-known cricketer. However, on the night of the dinner, Bunny overhears the whispers of two members, and discovers that the club in fact suspect Raffles to be a gentleman thief. In the house, Raffles is too occupied in conversation for Bunny to warn him. At dinner, Raffles and the four men, including a Wild West novelist and a barrister who has sentenced criminals to death, amiably discuss convicted murderers and burglars. Eventually, Lord Thornaby mentions their belief that the same thief committed the burglary on Bond Street and the robbery of Lady Melrose's necklace. Raffles glibly replies that he has connections to the victims of both, and is impressed by the unknown criminal. The group jokes that the criminal might be in the house, and Lord Thornaby, anxious, sends his butler to check the house. The butler returns, and stutters that the bedroom door and dressing-room door are, disturbingly, locked from inside. All the men rush upstairs to investigate. The doors are jammed with wedges screwed with gimlets. Lord Thornaby asks his butler to fetch an emergency rope-ladder, and the novelist bravely climbs down and opens the dressing-room door. The room has been picked and ransacked. Lord Thornaby's parliamentary robes are gone. The men leave the scene to the police, and go to the house's library. The police find a broken clock, which signals that the time of the robbery was during dinner. Raffles is cleanly absolved of all suspicion. Afterwards, Bunny takes Raffles to his rooms to tell him the truth of the Criminologists' suspicions, only to learn that Raffles had known about them along. In fact, it was Raffles who had committed the burglary of Lord Thornaby's house, the previous night, using a rope-ladder and telescope walking-stick. He had also sneaked in quickly a second time, before dinner, to fake disorder and the broken clock. He had been visiting Bunny's rooms often to use them to spy on the house and prepare his plan. Later, Raffles returns the parliamentary robes to Lord Thornaby anonymously. Adaptations Television When the Raffles stories were adapted for British television in 1977, this story was merged with that of \\"A Jubilee Present\\" to create a single episode The Gold Cup. Radio BBC Radio adapted the story into the sixth episode of its Raffles radio drama, \\"The Criminologists Club\\", which first aired on 8 June 1988. The drama features Jeremy Clyde as Raffles and Michael Cochrane as Bunny. The episode follows most of the plot of the original story, with some changes: * In the drama, Raffles gives Bunny a telescope, though secretly for the purpose of using it to spy on Lord Thornaby's house. In the original story, Raffles uses Bunny's racecourse binoculars instead. * Inspector Mackenzie is present at Lord Thornaby's dinner in the drama. It is Mackenzie who notices the broken clock. * In the drama, the robbery of Bunny's bank is also ascribed by the criminologists to the infamous society burglar, in addition to the incidents on Bond Street and at Milchester. * In the drama, Raffles pretends to get drunk, while actually tossing his champagne into a potted plant. In the original story, Raffles merely limits his intake of champagne. * Rather than return the parliamentary robes as in the original story, in the drama Raffles replaces Bunny's old curtains with the robes.

It is a spin-off from Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, although it shares its title with the earlier 1960s British television series The Likely Lads, of which Whatever was the sequel. The screenplay is by the scriptwriters of the television show, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais; and the principal roles of Bob and Terry, as well as those of Bob's wife Thelma and Terry's sister Audrey, are played by the original television cast. This film would also mark the final screen appearance of Bewes and Bolam together; at the time of the film's release, the two had fallen out over a misunderstanding involving the press and never spoke to each other again after that. Bewes died on 21 November 2017. Plot An opening pre-credits sequence shows the conception of both Lads during a Second World War air raid. After the opening titles the film cuts to Bob and Terry, both aged about thirty, playing football with some boys. The main plot begins with Bob and Terry's favourite watering hole, the Fat Ox, being demolished. The middle class Bob feels great sentimentality for this loss, whereas the working class Terry, who is now living in a high rise council flat, is more optimistic about the city's redevelopment, pointing out that he now has a \\"modern kitchen, a lovely view and an inside lavatory\\". From this establishing sequence the plot unfolds: Terry receives his final divorce decree, freeing him from his wife in West Germany, and is looking forward to a bright future; Bob on the other hand is growing tired of his married life with Thelma, and jaded with his social activities (the two things he boasted about in the television series). Terry is now in a relationship with Christina (known as \\"Chris\\"), a Finnish beauty who works at the local boutique, of whom Bob is openly envious. Thelma sees this as an opportunity to get Terry married and settled down, thus removing the perceived threat to her marriage to Bob which Terry, as Bob's lifelong best friend, represents. In her pursuit of this, Thelma insists the four of them going away on a caravanning holiday in Northumberland; but while Thelma and Chris enjoy the trip, Bob and Terry do not. They hitch up the caravan, with the girls asleep in it, and set off to drive home. However, while they are stationary at a set of temporary traffic lights, Thelma and Chris get out and Bob drives away before they can get back in, stranding them in front of the churchgoing congregation of the market town. Not realising they're now alone, Bob and Terry nevertheless pick up Sandra and Glenys, two attractive young female hitch-hikers, before Thelma and Chris catch up with them again. As a result of the trip, Terry and Chris split up, and Bob and Thelma separate. Bob decides to stay temporarily at Terry's new flat; but Terry (who is not expecting him) is busy seducing Iris, a colleague of Chris, and Bob unwittingly walks in on their lovemaking. Due to a misunderstanding, both Bob and Thelma believe the other is having sexual relations elsewhere, and have a furious argument in the back of Terry's employer's van. Unbeknownst to them, the van's public address system is still switched on as Terry had been advertising the latest washing powder, ExtraLite, broadcasting their argument across the neighbourhood. Terry loses his job because of this incident. Bob and Terry drive up to Whitley Bay for a weekend break, and take a room in a bed and breakfast. Bob promptly seduces the landlady's daughter, whilst Terry is seduced by the landlady. After hearing noises from her daughter's bedroom the landlady walks in and Bob has to make a quick getaway through the bedroom window. The same then happens to Terry, with the daughter walking in on him in bed with her mother; this time it is Terry who makes a rapid and trouserless departure through the bedroom window. But when the landlady goes down to the front door to let Terry back in, Bob appears instead, without his trousers, causing her to cry rape. The Lads make a hasty--and trouserless--departure in Bob's car. They return to Terry's flat safely only to find Thelma and Terry's sister Audrey there, with neither Bob nor Terry able to explain the absence of their trousers. Taking Audrey's advice, Terry makes plans to emigrate. He signs on as a deckhand aboard a ship leaving Newcastle docks, and the two lads spend his last night in England drinking on board the ship. Unknown to Bob, Terry decides not to go. He disembarks; but Bob, heavily intoxicated, falls asleep on board, and awakes in a lifeboat to discover the ship has sailed. The last scene in the film has Terry explaining to Thelma that they'll realise Bob is on board by accident and put him off at the first port of call, Bahrain. Throughout the film Bob's car, the recently introduced Vauxhall Chevette, suffers as much indignity as the human characters, having the wheels stolen, crashed across the carriageway to Terry's horror, an accident with the caravan and while escaping trouserless from the guest house, Terry insists Bob break the window to get in, only for Terry to discover his door wasn't locked, and suggest that Bob should be more careful.

Coventry Evening Telegraph felt the film only \\"magnified the failings of these situation comedy ideas\\". Daily Mirror were positive in their review, commenting: \\"Films based on TV series rarely transfer successfully to the big screen. The Likely Lads is an exception.\\" They praised the film's \\"warmly- amusing situations\\", \\"crisp dialogue\\" and \\"real-life characters\\". Later, in 2004 it received five stars in the Radio Times film guide,Radio Times: Guide to Films, 2004. P.825 and also received good reviews in What's on TV.

The first procurement programme for new locomotives set up by the Bavarian Group Administration of the Deutsche Reichsbahn included plans for an electric locomotive for heavy passenger train duties on electrified lines in Bavaria. From the numerous designs put forward, it was decided to opt for a 2'BB2' locomotive, which would be fitted with the same motors as another electric goods train locomotive in the programme, the DRG Class E 91. This new design departed from the previous approach of building electric locomotives with a slow running, large motor and went for four smaller electric motors. The drive was divided into two groups within a single frame. Each group had two motors, that drove a common countershaft using cogs. The countershaft drove a jackshaft via inclined driving rods which was coupled to two driving axles with coupling rods. In order to ensure that the permitted axle load was not exceeded the engines were given a leading and trailing bogie. The locomotive body with its two driver's cabs was built on the frame. The vehicle components were manufactured by Maffei and the electrical equipment by WASSEG, a joint venture of AEG and SSW. The manufacturers delivered the locomotives in 1924 and 1925 to the DRG, who took them into service, still as Class EP 5, with the numbers 21 501 - 535. In 1927 they were designated as E 52 01 - 35. The vehicles were exclusively based at Bavarian depots. By 1945, numbers E 52 02, 31 and 35 were retired. The DB took over the rest of the engines, but by 1950 numbers E 52 01, 29 and 32 had also retired. The remaining 29 machines were given the designation Class 152 in 1968. As new, powerful standard electric locomotives were available in large numbers as part of the DB's new construction programme, these heavy machines were soon redundant. In February 1973 the last engine of this class, number 152 014, was withdrawn from service. The Bavarian EP 5 was the heaviest electric locomotive ever to run in Germany, not the DRG Class E 95 as is often asserted.  Preserved locomotives  Of the 35 Class E 52 locos built, only one has been preserved. E 52 34 may be found today in the livery of Bavarian EP 5 21 534, non-operational, in the Nuremberg Transport Museum.

His talent and leadership on the field was hampered by off-field incidents throughout his career. He is currently serving a jail term for the manslaughter of a 50-year- old man in 2012. Playing career Field made his debut with South Sydney as a seventeen-year-old in 1990, playing one game from the bench. By 1993, with his flashes of brilliance on-field, he had earned himself a position in the first-grade team on a regular basis and in 1994 he was promoted to captain. In 1995, Field was stripped of the captaincy and fined $10,000 for missing training and at the end of the 1996 season he left the Rabbitohs for Manly- Warringah. Both Cliff Lyons and Geoff Toovey were in the Manly team and Field had to compete against the two test halves for the halfback position. Field was a member of the 1997 Manly side which lost the Grand Final to the Newcastle Knights. Early in 1999, Field requested a release from the Manly club and he played his last game with the team in round 5. In round 7, he steered his new club, Balmain, to a win over Manly. Field became a Wests Tiger in 2000 when Balmain and Western Suburbs merged at the end of the 1999 season. After only four games of the 2001 season, Field and teammate, Kevin McGuinness, were suspended by the National Rugby League (NRL) for six months after testing positive for stimulants. Field did not participate in any other first-grade games in Australia. In 2002, Field moved to the south-west of France to play for the Pia Donkeys in the French Rugby League Championship. Following the sacking of coach John Elias in February, 2003, Field took over coaching duties and led Pia in the club's 16-14 loss in the French Cup final. On his return to Australia in May, 2003, Field joined the Newtown Jets in the premier-league competition, captaining the side for the remainder of the season. From 2005 till 2009, Field was captain-coach of Wagga Brothers in the Group 9 competition. In 2010, he joined the Cudgen Hornets in the Northern Rivers Regional Rugby League, along with his cousin Matt Seers. After two seasons with the Hornets, Field retired as a player but remained with the club as coach. In 2013, at age 40, Field was playing A-grade park football for Moore Park club in the South Sydney junior league competition. Personal life Craig Field discussing the case with the media After claiming to be the victim of an armed robbery on the night of 18 February 2007 at a hotel in Wagga Wagga of which he was manager at the time, it was alleged that the robbery had been staged and Field was subsequently charged with recruiting a child to participate in a criminal activity, making a false statement to police and three counts of stealing after a robbery. On 11 August 2009, after a four-day trial at Wagga Wagga Court House, Field was acquitted of all charges by a majority (11‚Äì1) jury verdict. On 15 July 2012, Field was arrested and charged with assault occasioning grievous bodily harm after allegedly punching 50-year-old Kelvin Kane outside a hotel in Kingscliff, New South Wales. Kane was knocked unconscious and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation when paramedics arrived at the scene. He later died in hospital, prompting the charges against Field to be upgraded to murder. Field was released from prison on 18 December 2012 after a bail bond was posted, with strict reporting conditions. The murder trial, in which Field pleaded not guilty, began in November 2014. On 9 December 2014, Field was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter over the death of Kane. He was sentenced to a maximum of 10 years and a minimum of 7 and a half years. Field will be eligible for parole in 2021.

According to the western European architecture, the construction was solid, and comfortable. Most of the architecture in the school still exist. Quoc Hoc main building . In 1932, Qu·ªëc H·ªçc ‚Äì Hu·∫ø opened many specialized classes and became known as Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh Lycee. On 19 December 1946, during the confrontation against French Colonialists, the school was moved into two places: One branch called \\"Binh Tri Thien School\\" was located in Huong Khe, H√† Tƒ©nh province and the other branch called \\"Huynh Thuc Khang School\\", was located in ƒê·ª©c Th·ªç, H√† Tƒ©nh Province. The branch came back to Hu·∫ø after ten years of disruption, and was conquered by French Colonialists as a barrack on April 29, 1955. Later Qu·ªëc H·ªçc - Hu·∫ø was reinstated and restarted its normal operation. Since the academic year of 1994-95, Qu·ªëc H·ªçc has been designated as one of the three National High School of high proficiency declared by the Prime Minister (the other two schools are L√™ H·ªìng Phong High School of Ho Chi Minh City and Chu Van An High School of Hanoi). In 2009, Qu·ªëc H·ªçc ‚Äì Hu·∫ø High School was officially renamed as Qu·ªëc H·ªçc ‚Äì Hu·∫ø High School for the Gifted, which made it become the first and the only Gifted High School of Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø Province.  School campus  Location The school was built on the site once known as the Admiral's Palace, a royal naval base established in 1806 (the fifth year of King Gia Long's reign). Qu·ªëc H·ªçc ‚Äì Hu·∫ø is located on the bank of Perfume River. It is the largest high school campus of Vietnam with many large shady trees, stone benches, and French architectural designed buildings.

Recently, Quoc Hoc - Hu·∫ø has organizes about 40 classes of the following subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Vietnamese Literature, History, Geography, English, Japanese and French. The students in these classes have more academic hours than the students of other schools. The curriculum is extremely demanding, statistically equivalent to that of junior level through senior level in universities. This is why it is more difficult for students to be admitted in the specialized classes. The total number of students in one specialized class is limited under 30 in order for the students in the former to perform experiments easily and to receive more attention and directions from teachers.

It shelters under pieces of wood during the day, and is a nocturnal predatory species thought to mainly feed on semi-aquatic snails.

History The Shingle Inn opened in 1936 at 254 Edward Street, Brisbane in 1936 as a Tudor inn style restaurant. The Shingle Inn is a considerably well known aspect of Brisbane's dining culture, where it has welcomed generations of diners, and was also popular with American service personnel during World War II. It is one of the oldest continuing restaurants in the city of Brisbane. It has been owned since 1975 by the Bellchambers Family. With the closure of the flagship store in 2002 due to the new Queens Plaza development, the fittings of the store were removed and placed into storage. A franchise of the restaurant was created with a dozen stores throughout the Brisbane central business district, suburbs, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. With the re- opening of Brisbane City Hall after its $215 million refurbishment in April 2013, the fittings and layout of the original Shingle Inn in Edward Street were replaced inside Brisbane City Hall, re-creating the olde-world Tudor atmosphere of the original 1936 restaurant. The sugar bowls used in the restored city hall branch bear the engraved names of the Shingle Inn and other former Brisbane cafes (Renoir, Websters, Yorktown) that were owned by the Webster and Bellchambers families. The Shingle Inn has a franchise network of 44 cafes in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and in December 2019, Shingle Inn opened its first store in South Australia as well as their first international store in New Zealand.

His criminal base was his home town Gioia Tauro on the Tyrrhenian coast of Calabria. He was the capobastone (head of command) of the Piromalli 'ndrina. 'Ndrangheta boss Mommo Piromalli ruled the most powerful 'Ndrangheta group in the Gioia Tauro plain with his younger brother Giuseppe \\"Peppe\\" Piromalli. The Piromalli 'Ndrina contained more than 200 members.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 31 Before becoming one of the most feared criminal power brokers in the Gioia Tauro plain, Mommo Piromalli was a cowherd.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 51 In 1939 he was charged with illegal carriage of firearms, in 1940 for grievous bodily harm, in 1944 for robbery with violence and in 1950 for murder.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 20 In 1967, the court imposed a five-year mandatory internal banishment (soggiorno obbligato) to remove Piromalli from his home town and criminal associates. Esposizione introduttiva del Pubblico ministero nel processo nei confronti di Giulio Andreotti, Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia Palermo, 1994, pp. 102-3 Together with Antonio Macr√¨ from Siderno on the Ionic coast and Domenico Mico Tripodo, the boss of the city of Reggio Calabria and the surrounding areas, the Piromalli brothers formed a sort of triumvirate since the beginning of the 1960s until the outbreak of the First 'Ndrangheta war in the mid 1970s. Their senior position was recognized by all other heads of 'Ndrangheta families and their advice was in most cases followed without protest.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 60 Establishing the Santa Mommo Piromalli and the bosses of several other families established La Santa at the end of the 1960s. In the same time, he was initiated in the Italian Freemasonry.^Mario Guarin, Poteri segreti.

They were eager to modify the traditional rules of the 'Ndrangheta in order to be able to access contracts for public works in the region and start illegal activities such as drug trafficking, which were prohibited by the traditional code but promised to be very profitable. Through the membership of covert Masonic lodges the 'Ndrangheta bosses were able to contact law enforcement authorities, judges and politicians that were necessary to access to public work contracts.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 115 Guarino, Poteri segreti e criminalit√†, pp. 14-15, Nisio Palmieri, Dossier della Fondazione Cesar e dell‚ÄôAssociazione Sicurstrada per conto della Consulta Nazionale dei Consigli Regionali Unipol Assicurazioni According to Gaetano Costa (the former chief of the Messina Mafia family turned state witness), \\"it was Mommo Piromalli who ‚Äì given the enormous interests which the existed in the Reggio Calabria area (the railroad stump, the steelwork center, and the port in Gioia Tauro, etc.) ‚Äì entrusted himself with the rank of santista, in order to assert his higher authority and hence directly control the public works. He said that this rank had been given him directly in Toronto, where there was a very important 'ndrina.\\" These innovations and the new institution of La Santa were opposed by the more traditionalist bosses such as Antonio Macr√¨ and Domenico Tripodo. Only at the end of the so-called First 'Ndrangheta war, which took place in 1974-76 and led to the deaths of Macr√¨ and Tripodo as well as the rise of Piromalli and the De Stefano brothers as the new leaders of the Reggio Calabria 'ndrine, was the new institution fully recognized. In 1973, Piromalli was charged of heroin trafficking when an undercover operation by the US Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) targeting Saverio Mammoliti revealed that Mammoliti needed permission of Macr√¨ and \\"Don Mommo\\" Piromalli.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 152 Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, p. 165 Getty kidnap Piromalli was one of the men charged with the kidnap of John Paul Getty III on July 10, 1973, in Rome.Catching the Kidnapers, Time Magazine, January 28, 1974 The ransom initially demanded was $17 million (equivalent to $ in ) for his safe return. However, the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather. John Paul Getty Jr. asked his father J. Paul Getty for the money, but was refused, arguing that his 13 other grandchildren could also become kidnap targets if he paid. In November 1973, an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike. The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid $3.2 million. The demand stated \\"This is Paul's ear. If we don't get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.\\" When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to $3 million, Getty agreed to pay no more than $2.2 million (equivalent to $ in ), the maximum that would be tax-deductible. He lent his son the remaining $800,000 at four percent interest. Getty's grandson was found alive on December 15, 1973, in a Lauria filling station, in the province of Potenza, shortly after the ransom was paid. Getty III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Getty III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He died on February 5, 2011, at the age of 54. Nine men had been arrested, including Piromalli, in Gioia Tauro on March 23, 1974.Getty Case Suspect Arrested in Italy, The New York Times, March 23, 1974 Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, pp. 152-53 In September 1974, he evaded from a clinic in Rome where he had been transferred to receive treatment for an ulcer. He was arrested again in October 1975 in Rome, where he had a lunch meeting with Paolo De Stefano and Pasquale Condello. Piromalli was in possession of banknotes that could be traced to the Getty kidnap.

In 1977 disagreements about business interests emerged between Piromalli and the De Stefano clan. A hit squad headed by Peppe Piromalli killed Giorgio De Stefano. Some 1,000 people were killed in clan wars over the construction contracts.Spotts & Wieser, Italy, a Difficult Democracy, p. 188 On February 11, 1979, Mommo Piromalli died of cirrhosis of the liver in a prison hospital in Gioia Tauro.Dickie, Mafia Republic: Italy's Criminal Curse, p. 140 He was succeeded as head of the clan by his younger brother Giuseppe \\"Peppe\\" Piromalli.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 49 Piromalli also had contacts with Sicilian Mafiosi such as Angelo La Barbera and Stefano Bontate.

Ltd. whom the July 15, 1957 issue of TIME magazine called \\"The man who did the most to open up northwest Canada's wilderness‚Äîand convince oilmen of its treasures.\\" In addition, McMahon was a major racehorse owner/breeder whose Thoroughbreds competed in North America and Europe and who won the 1969 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes with the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame colt, Majestic Prince. Biography  Early life and career  Frank McMahon was born in the village of Moyie in the East Kootenays of British Columbia, Canada, the son of a hard-rock miner. He attended Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, where he was a campus mate of Bing Crosby. As a young man, he worked as a driller for British Columbia mining companies until 1927 when he founded his own diamond-drilling contracting business which he expanded into drilling for oil and natural gas.  West Turner Petroleums  Frank McMahon and two brothers established West Turner Petroleums to explore and develop oil deposits in the Turner Valley Oilfields in Alberta. Their major find generated sufficient revenues and income to allow for expansion through acquisitions and exploration. He later merged two smaller companies with West Turner and formed a holding company, Pacific Petroleums Ltd. In 1945 McMahon founded Atlantic Oil Company and acquired rights to a part of the Leduc field, near Leduc, Alberta. After Imperial Oil's discovery of oil at Leduc in 1947, the Atlantic No. 3 well discovered oil on March 8, 1948. It was well-publicized due to the oil blowout that took six months to contain and a well fire that started in the week prior to the well being contained. The well propelled McMahon's wealth. Pacific's headquarters were set up in Calgary, Alberta. In December 1947, McMahon's operations began oil and gas exploration in the Peace River Region after the B.C. government opened the area to exploration. In November 1951, Pacific's Fort St. John No. 1 well found significant quantities of good quality oil, B.C.'s first oil discovery. In 1952 the company drilled the first of many high-producing gas wells at Fort St. John. In about 1961 McMahon and his brother George sold their controlling interest in Pacific Petroleums to Phillips Petroleum Company. In 1977 Pacific Petroleums was purchased by Petro- Canada.  Westcoast Transmission  McMahon saw an enormous opportunity to supply natural gas to the huge United States market. In 1949 he incorporated Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. whose business plan included the construction of a 650-mile gas pipeline from Taylor in north-eastern British Columbia to the United States. McMahon personally began lobbying the Canadian and American governments to remove their restrictions on the export and import of natural gas. In December 1954, he signed a $400-million contract with Pacific Northwest Pipeline Corp. to sell natural gas into their pipeline system in the United States. In 1955 Westcoast was awarded permission from the U.S. Federal Power Commission to export gas. Construction started the same year on the $170-million, 650-mile Westcoast Pipeline from the Peace River area to the U.S. border, to hook into the Pacific Northwest Pipeline Corp.'s six-state gas grid and to supply gas to Vancouver. The pipeline was Canada's first \\"big- inch\\" pipeline. Along with its gathering system, the processing plants and compressor stations were completed in the fall of 1957. In 1964, Westcoast Transmission built another processing plant at Fort Nelson, British Columbia, in support of an additional 250-mile line to the company's new discoveries in the Canadian Northwest. After McMahon's death in 1986, Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. was renamed Westcoast Energy Inc., and in 2002 Duke Energy of Charlotte, North Carolina, acquired the company in a deal worth US$3.5 billion. The natural gas pipeline business was later spun off as part of Spectra Energy, which merged with Enbridge in 2017.  Other business ventures  In the 1950s McMahon had an interest in Alberta Distillers Ltd. In October 1957, Time Magazine estimated his worth at $50-million and that he controlled assets in partnership with others that totalled about $500-million. Frank McMahon's significant contribution to Canada's economic prosperity was recognized by his election to the Canadian Business Hall of Fame. In the 1950s Frank McMahon backed a number of Broadway plays in New York, including The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees.  Horse racing  Frank McMahon, a founding member of the Jockey Club of Canada, raced thoroughbreds on his own as well as in partnership with others. His Frank McMahon Stable Inc. won numerous races at racetracks across Canada including the 1966 British Columbia Derby at Exhibition Park Racetrack in Vancouver and the 1970 Canadian Derby at Edmonton's Northlands Park. His most famous horse was Majestic Prince. Frank McMahon was inducted in the British Columbia Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1995 in the breeders/owners category.http://www.bchorseracinghalloffame.org/mcmahon_frank.htm [Retrieved: 31 October 2008] He set up a racing stable in California with U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey-turned-trainer Johnny Longden. Among the horses they raced was the great Majestic Prince whose important stakes include the 1969 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Majestic Prince was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1988 and was listed at No. 46. in The Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century. In 1975, McMahon had another Triple Crown contender with Diabolo who finished third in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, and was fourth in the Belmont Stakes. In the 1950s he was part owner of Alberta Ranches, Ltd. which won the 1953 Hollywood Gold Cup with Royal Serenade. Together with Calgary newspaper publisher Max Bell, Frank McMahon founded the Golden West Farms thoroughbred breeding operation at Okotoks, Alberta. Among its notable wins, Golden West Farms' racing stable won the 1968 Queen's Plate with Merger. In partnership with American singer, Bing Crosby, McMahon and Bell owned Meadow Court who raced in Europe where he won the 1965 Irish Derby and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. McMahon also teamed up with Kentucky horseman Leslie Combs II of Spendthrift Farm to breed Crowned Prince, a sibling of Majestic Prince, who in 1970 became the first yearling to be sold at auction for half a million dollars. McMahon won the bidding for Crowned Prince and sent him to race in England where he won the Dewhurst and Champagne Stakes and was the 1971 champion two-year-old colt in England. Leslie Combs also bred McMahon's Triple Bend, a colt who set a world record time in winning the 1972 Los Angeles Handicap.  McMahon Stadium  In 1960 Frank and brother George McMahon donated $300,000 to the then University of Alberta (Calgary), now the University of Calgary, to help build a football stadium. They also guaranteed the $750,000 balance of the $1,050,000 construction cost. It was named McMahon Stadium in their honour. In 1988, the stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of that year‚Äôs winter Olympics held in Calgary. The university acquired complete ownership of the stadium and land in 1985 after the guaranteed financing was retired in 1973. The stadium is operated by the McMahon Stadium Society. Until the guaranteed financing was retired the McMahons appointed two of the six members of the society. The first treasurer of the society was the McMahons' accountant, William Macintosh. In 2001 the McMahon brothers were named to the Calgary Stampeders Wall of Fame in the builder category.  Personal life  McMahon's first marriage was to Isabel Grant. The couple had three children: Frank, William and Marion. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1956, McMahon married Betty Betz (1920-2010). Betz, born in Chicago, attended Sarah Lawrence College where she earned a degree in journalism in 1941. After graduation, she worked for a year for Harper's Bazaar, and then went on to create an advice column for teens, which was syndicated in Hearst newspapers. In 1951 she hosted the television programme Going Places with Betty Betz. Additionally, she illustrated seven books, including Manners for Moppets, The Betty Betz Teen-Age Cookbook, and The Betty Betz Party Book, the Teen-Age Guide to Social Success. In 1959 the McMahons moved from Vancouver to Palm Beach. They maintained homes in Acapulco, New York City, Vancouver, and Paget, Bermuda. The couple had three children: Francine, Bill and Bettina. Bill had two sons, Michael and Frank McMahon. Michael McMahon has two childeren Isabella and Christopher McMahon. Frank McMahon died in Hamilton, Bermuda in 1986. References * Brennan, Brian.

The toupha or toufa () is a kind of ornamental crest or head-dress with a plumage of the feathers, hair or bristles of exotic animals, worn in classical antiquity as a triumphal decoration. In surviving depictions, it is most often seen on military helmets and emperors' crowns. One of the most famous touphas is that which surmounted the crown or helmet of the bronze equestrian statue of the emperor Justinian I atop the column of Justinian, erected by said emperor, which stood in the Augustaion square of Constantinople. The toupha was made of gilded bronze, with a design of peacock-feathers. It is known primarily from a life-drawing of the statue made in the 15th century; the entire monument was later demolished. Particularly imposing in size, the head- dress fell from the statue in the 9th century and was remounted by an acrobat. A rope was stretched between the roof of Hagia Sophia and the summit of the column, by means of an arrow. Along this line, one could tightrope-walk to the statue.

The film was produced in 2001 by YektƒÅ Film.KƒÅghaz-e bi Khatt, in Persian, S≈´reh, . The principal roles in the film are played by Khosrow Shakibai (JahƒÅngir) and Hadyeh Tehrani (RoyƒÅ). For his role, Khosrow Shakibai was nominated for the Crystal Phoenix Award, in the category of men, at the 20th Fajr International Film Festival in 2001, received the second Best Actor Of The Year Award From Writers and Critics, in the category of men, in 2002, and was awarded the Golden Tablet from Iran Actor Site in 2003. Hadyeh Tehrani's acting in this film has been praised by many critics as equally superb and laudable.MƒÅhnƒÅmeh-ye Film (The Film Monthly), in Persian, No. 288, year 20, MordƒÅd 1381 AH (July‚ÄìAugust, 2002), Tehran, Iran. For her role, she was nominated for the Crystal Phoenix Award, in the category of women, at the 20th Fajr International Film Festival in 2001. The title of the film is derived from a remark by RoyƒÅ that she never was able to write neatly on a ruled paper, but this changed when she wrote on unruled paper, thus giving voice to the blessings of freedom. The film, with a strong cast of Iranian actors, received critical acclaim in Iran: Various critics have described the movie's dialogues as pithy and thought-provoking, and the language used as both natural and powerful. The quality of the acting and directing have both been praised as well. TaghvƒÅ'i attempts to pay attention to the most minute details of the film (for instance, the accuracy with which the separate consecutive shuts match, or the precision of the angles at which the communicating actors look away from the camera). As Tahmineh Milani once has noted,Exclusive interview with Tahmineh Milani, in Persian, Bebin.tv, August 6, 2007: Part 1 (9 min 8 sec), Part 2 (8 min 7 sec). accuracy of presentation is one of the hallmarks of NƒÅser TaghvƒÅ'i's films. The dialogues of the film are replete with terse remarks and critical commentaries on the contemporary political and social conditions prevailing in Iran.Aside from remarks concerning the colours of the school uniforms for girls, which are mandated to be dark and which Mangul utterly dislikes (Mangul, the young daughter of the family, also dislikes to wear headscarf; she has beautiful long hairs and is clearly proud of this beauty), there are several verbal and visual references in this film to the \\"chain murders\\" that took place during 1998 in Iran, with writers, intellectuals and the dissident politicians as the main targets. Of note is the fact that the family home is located in Evin (Darband, north-west of Tehran), \\"behind the [Evin] prison\\".MƒÅhnƒÅmeh-ye Film, p. 88 Plot The film starts with a scene of a sitting room, empty of people, at some two minutes to 7 o'clock in the morning, and ends with a scene of the same empty room at some two minutes past 7 o'clock in the morning of some weeks later; this passage of time is accurately depicted by the brightness of the natural light that is reflected on the wall of a corridor, that leads to this sitting room, in the initial and final scenes.Since the date of the opening scene coincides with the first day of schools following the summer school-holiday, this date must coincide with the autumnal equinox (explicitly, the first day of the month Mehr in the Iranian calendar), or a day very soon thereafter, should the autumnal equinox fall on a holiday, such as a Friday. With the time of the sunrise advancing in the course of the autumn, the light reflected on the wall at 7 O'clock in the morning must be less bright in the closing scene than in the opening scene. And this is indeed the case. The meticulous attention that TaghvƒÅ'i has given to the accurate representation of even the most mundane aspects of the film would at first sight seem to be at odds with the fact that with the exception of the opening and closing scenes, in all other scenes where the clock on the wall of the sitting room is in sight, its pendulum is conspicuously motionless. The opening scene depicts some moments before the family starts a very active day (the day at which the two children of the family, Shangul and Mangul, have their first school-day after the summer school-holiday) and the closing scene, the end of a protracted Friday night,Since Friday is the equivalent in Iran of Sunday in nominally Christian countries, the night on Friday should be compared with that on Sunday. during which JahƒÅngir and RoyƒÅ have spent an intellectually and emotionally exhausting night. The motionless pendulum suggests that the events in the intervening period have taken place out of time, or only in imagination. Although the work presented by TaghvƒÅ'i certainly qualifies as a surrealist art-form, this motionless pendulum serves as a more profound tool than a means that solely hints at surrealism. TaghvƒÅ'i conveys a number of unobtrusive verbal and visual messages to his viewers. Briefly, TaghvƒÅ'i and Ms Minoo Farsh'chi, the co-author of the film script, variously refer to the theory of eternal recurrence, as revived by e.g. Friedrich Nietzsche, with a strong emphasis on the importance of having a creative mind thereby to forge room for free will in at least an imaginative world. JahƒÅngir is a draughtsman, or perhaps an architect. RoyƒÅ is normally a housewife, but has recently started to attend a course on writing film scripts,The course is taught at a school for film making in BƒÅgh-e Ferdows. an undertaking that has been actively encouraged by JahƒÅngir. TaghvƒÅ'i introduces his viewers to RoyƒÅ's penchant for story telling through a scene in which she tells a bedtime story for Shangul and Magul, the story being in reality a popular Persian children's story which is very reminiscent of The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids. This scene also reveals the two children as being both imaginative and highly theatrical. The names Shangul and Magul are the names of two baby goats in the same story; there is no hint in the film however that Shangul and Magul might be the pet names of the children, as opposed to their real names. JahƒÅngir is working on a project that he apparently has initially introduced to RoyƒÅ as being a villa on an island, but that RoyƒÅ has later discovered that it is a prison compound on the island.In an earlier part of the film, TaghvƒÅ'i lets the viewer know about this fact through a scene (of a house party) in which JahƒÅngir and Ali discuss the details of a map prepared by JahƒÅngir and talk about the wall of the compound being four metres high and this height not having been considered as sufficient. Following an intense argument between JahƒÅngir and RoyƒÅ, JahƒÅngir reveals that he himself is deeply unhappy about his project, as his colleagues have nicknamed the prison compound as JahƒÅngir's Villa. An apparently innocuous argument between JahƒÅngir and RoyƒÅ, married already for twelve years, thus leads to an intense and emotional flow of exchanges revolving around the subject matter of how well even closest individuals know each other and the reason why JahƒÅngir reacts nervously to RoyƒÅ's curiosity regarding his past. The deliberately ambiguous circumstance in which the intense discussion between RoyƒÅ and JahƒÅngir takes place, greatly enhances the power of the words exchanged between the two characters. On the one hand, one is given the impression that RoyƒÅ is curious because she is preparing her first film script for her class and that she must be using her husband's character in her story. On the other hand, while JahƒÅngir appears to be disconcerted, one cannot escape the suspicion that he may in fact be a willing participant in the creation of the script that RoyƒÅ is in the process of creating. JahƒÅngir never fails to ease the tension by using his dark humour when the going gets tough. It has been speculated that what one is witnessing is the film, or at least a rehearsal of it, is actually based on the script written by RoyƒÅ, with all the members of the family playing their allotted roles.One finds a posteriori justification for one's suspicions when in the later parts of the film one hears JahƒÅngir talking about his previous agreements with RoyƒÅ in regard to the script to be written by her. Furthermore, attending carefully to the conversations taking place between JahƒÅngir and RoyƒÅ throughout the film, one will not fail to recognise parts of these conversations in the draft texts of the final script written by RoyƒÅ. The philosophical messages of the film are mostly conveyed by the professor of literature (Jamshid Mashayekhi) who teaches the course that RoyƒÅ attends. His reflective manners and insightful statements convincingly portray him as a wise academic who has lived a profound life. In a pivotal scene, while being driven by RoyƒÅ to his home, in the vicinity of \\"the end of the world\\", he says: > \\"This world in which we live is not fit for working. Before I and you > everything in it has already been invented. The world of your story is a > kind of a world that you have to create yourself; if you want it to revolve > on its axis, it must revolve by your will; when you want the sun to shine, > it must shine, and when you do not want it to shine, it must disappear > behind the clouds; when you want that it rains, the rain must descend from > the sky; if you don't wish that it rains, wish it, and the rain will > stop.\\"Translated from Persian. It has been striven to preserve the > colloquial nature of the conversation. In the one but the penultimate scene of the film, NƒÅser TaghvƒÅ'i introduces a visual metaphor, indicative of the intimacy between a husband and wife. This metaphor, which consists of a knife falling from the table to the ground and subsequently being simultaneously retrieved by JahƒÅngir and RoyƒÅ, with the former grasping the handle of the knife firmly in his fist, and the latter fixing her fingers on the sides of the blade. Of note is the fact that in the motion pictures made in Iran men and women are not permitted to have physical contact.It should be realised that knife is a phallic symbol. Details Cast * Khosrow Shakibai: JahƒÅngir, husband of RoyƒÅ and father of Shangul and Mangul. JahƒÅngir is presented in the movie as a protagonist; a kind and liberal husband (however sometimes he demonstrates the repressed emotions of a traditional man).MƒÅhnƒÅmeh-ye Film, p. 90 He gladly entertains the guests and does not even contemplate to ask RoyƒÅ her reason for coming home after midnight, in complete disregard of the guests that she herself had invited. These aspects are dramatically counterbalanced by his ripostes to some of RoyƒÅ's protests. For instance, when RoyƒÅ complains about the state of the kitchen following her absence from home for several days, rather than offering a helping hand, JahƒÅngir proposes that she should take rest and leave the cleaning of the kitchen for the next day when she feels fresh. * Hadyeh Tehrani: RoyƒÅ, wife of JahƒÅngir and mother of Shangul and Mangul. She is depicted as an aspiring writer of film scripts, and desirous of becoming wealthy. JahƒÅngir suggests that she should become a professional writer, while at the same time warns that her strong reliance on her imagination, and her day-dreaming, may prove detrimental to the upbringing of their children (RoyƒÅ is the Persian word for dream and vision). As the time passes by and the plot advances further, viewers are led to wonder whether the film one views is the creation of RoyƒÅ herself, with all the members of the family the willing participants as the actors of the film.MƒÅhnƒÅmeh-ye Film, p. 91 * Jamshid Mashayekhi: Professor (of Literature), teaching a crash course of writing for aspiring writers of film scripts. He is very philosophical and rather enigmatic, although is very well loved by his pupils. When on a rainy night, after the end of a class, RoyƒÅ offers to drive him to his home, he says, without being sardonic, that he lives very far, in the vicinity of \\"the end of the world\\". While introducing the first feature film made in Iran in the course of one of his lectures, he mentions that on the day that this film was screened in Tehran for the first time, \\"68 years ago\\", he was born. One of the advises that he gives to his pupils is to forget all the books that they have read and all the films that they have watched, and begin writing their first film scripts by delving into their own personal lives and experiences. RoyƒÅ seems to take this advice to heart. * Arin Matlabi: Shangul, son of JahƒÅngir and RoyƒÅ and the elder brother of Mangul; he is about nine years old. The names Shangul and Mangul are that of two baby goats in a popular Iranian story for children (this story is very reminiscent of The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids). The film does not make explicit whether Shangul and Mangul are pet names, used by the family and friends, or real names. * HƒÅnieh MorƒÅdi: Mangul, daughter of JahƒÅngir and RoyƒÅ and the younger sister of Shangul; she is about seven years old. * Jamileh Sheykhi: Aziz, widowed mother of RoyƒÅ. She is outright and in many respects looks like someone with her feet squarely on the ground. Yet, when her friend, Esmat KhƒÅnom, asks her about the pestle, in the most serious tone, she responds that \\"our pestle gets lost every evening. ... I take it to my bed and during nights put in under my pillow.\\" * Nikoo Kheradmand: Esmat KhƒÅnom, a good friend of Aziz. Visiting Aziz on her way back to her home after visiting the graveside of her late husband, Ahmad, Aziz asks Esmat KhƒÅnom whether she feels a sense of peace for having visited her husband's graveside. After some thought and hesitation, Esmat KhƒÅnom answers first that she does not know, and then says no. Later, she says that when she contemplates, she comes to the realisation that in the year since her husband has died, she has not become lonelier than the thirty years that she had lived with him. * Akbar Moazzezi: Ali, friend and colleague of JahƒÅngir. He is the husband of Susan JƒÅn who is a friend and confidante of RoyƒÅ. * Soghra Obeysi: Susan JƒÅn (sometimes also Susan Joon), wife of Ali and close friend and confidante of RoyƒÅ. She surfers from marital problems at home, but does not hesitate to give marital advice to RoyƒÅ. JahƒÅngir, although very courteous towards Susan JƒÅn, in her absence shows signs of being annoyed by her inquisitiveness and interference in his private family life. Although JƒÅn (as well as Joon) is a term of endearment in Persian (the actual name of Susan JƒÅn being simply Susan), the way JahƒÅngir pronounces JƒÅn in saying Susan JƒÅn, signifies a considerable measure of patronising on his part, reflecting his deep irritation by Susan's interference in his family life. * ShƒÅhin Jafari: Mohandes, a friend and colleague of JahƒÅngir and Ali. We see him only once as a guest at a small party held at the house of JahƒÅngir and RoyƒÅ. * Mahmoud Beheshti: Taxi Driver. Although he is only seen twice, his two brief exchanges with RoyƒÅ are crucial to the plot.

The marble column was historiated with a spiralling frieze of reliefs on its shaft and supported a colossal statue of the emperor, probably made of bronze, which fell down in 740. Its summit was accessible by an internal spiral staircase. Only its massive masonry base survives. It is known as the Avret Ta≈ü in Turkish and located on Haseki Kadƒ±n Sokuk in the Fatih district of Istanbul. It is now mostly surrounded by modern buildings.  History  The column and forum of Arcadius were on the Seventh Hill of Constantinople, also known as the Xerolophos (Greek ). The column's construction was begun after 401 to commemorate Arcadius's triumph over the Goths under the renegade magister militum Gainas in the wars of 399‚Äì401. Arcadius died in 408, but the column was only completed in 421, so the forum of Arcadius and its column was sometimes referred to by the name of his son and successor Theodosius II. It was destroyed in the 1719 earthquake.Konrad, 2001, p. 324 - n. 19 Inspired the Column of Constantine erected the previous century by his predecessor and the city's founder Constantine I, the Column of Theodosius had been set up by Arcadius's father Theodosius I in the forum Tauri in the 380s and follows the tradition of triumphal columns established by those of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. During the Ottoman Empire, the monument was ascended and measured, in secret, by Petrus Gyllius and described in his De Topographia Constantinopoleos et de illius antiquitatibus libri IV. He described the shaft as being composed of 21 large blocks; only one at the base survives. Detail of the shaft's and pedestal's decoration is conserved in a series of drawings made in 1575 and preserved in the Freshfield Album, kept at Trinity College, Cambridge; the carvings on the remaining parts of the structure have since been largely obliterated by fire and erosion.  Description  The socle was around 2 m high and of three steps, of which only one remains above ground.Konrad, 2001, p. 370. A pedestal, nearly 8 m tall with cornice and mouldings at the top and bottom, that probably faced the Mese odos to the south and whose southern, eastern and western faces were decorated with carved reliefs in four registers. The north side, mostly undecorated and probably facing away from the Mese, had a doorway which allowed access to the spiral staircase within. The pedestal contained three small rooms, the first of which had a niche in the western wall and was decorated with a cross-in- wreath.Konrad, 2001, pp. 348-54 & 440-'1.Konrad, 2001, p. 385. The staircase led to a door on the south face of the column's statue's pedestal, giving access to a platform atop the column's capital. The pedestal's four registers of reliefs were carved on its four courses of monolithic masonry. Above the pedestal's cornice was a plinth of two steps, decorated with eagles at its corners holding garlands with putti above and reclining river gods below.Konrad, 2001, pp. 376-'7. Above this was a torus carved as an oak wreath bound by a floral filet depicting theatrical masks and mythological hunt scenes involving lions, griffons, and birds.Konrad, 2001, pp. 378-'9. This was the base of the column itself; the surviving portion of the column terminates here; nothing above remains. The column shaft was carved with reliefs depicting the history of the campaigns against Gainas and his Gothic foederati rebels in 399‚Äì401. The sculptural register spiralled up clockwise around the column until the egg-and-dart echinus underneath the Doric capital at the top. Each corner of the abacus, on the capital's underside, was embellished with a Chi-Rho. Taken together, the shaft, plinth, and torus were about 31.92 m tall. On the capital rested the statue's pedestal, about 4 m high, with smooth shaft and a \\"Pergamene capital\\". The statue itself was probably around 8.5 m tall and similar to the one known to have been atop the Column of Theodosius.Konrad, 2001, pp. 383-'4. The monument's pedestal depicted Triumph celebrated by Arcadius and his brother and co-emperor Honorius, augustus of the West. Although the victory over Gainas was a success in Arcadius's eastern jurisdiction, the emperors are shown together as equals in a joint Triumph that never took place. The lowest of the four registers of reliefs showed bound barbarian captives and arms (west), Victories inscribing on shields with captives (east), and Victories carrying tropaia and leading captives and female personifications of cities bearing tribute (south). The next register showed Victories with a trophy approached on either side by Roman soldiers leading captives (west), Senators presenting the annual senatorial tribute, the aurum oblaticium, together with the Tyche of Constantinople and of Rome, each wearing their corona muralis (east) and the co-emperors in armour, affronted and holding Victories standing on globes above bound captives and flanked by ranks of soldiers and statesmen (south). The third register from the bottom showed the paired emperors in armour leaning on their spears and holding globes, attended by soldiers and officials (west), the emperors in civilian dress as consul, with lictors, soldiers and statesmen (east), and a pair of flying Victories bearing a wreath surrounding a Chi-Rho, each beside a trophy (south). The fourth, topmost register of carvings showed airborne Victories holding a laurel wreath surrounding a Latin cross, alongside each a putto, and the Sun and Moon in their quadrigae (west), flying Victories holding a tabula emblazoned with a cross, flanked by putti with torches (east), and diverse armour and weapons together with two Chi-Rho banners.

He currently plays on the FIVB World Beach Volleyball Tour with new partner Clemens Doppler. Horst found most success with partner Florian Gosch on the FIVB World Beach Volleyball Tour, however a knee injury forced Florian Gosch into early retirement in the fall of 2010. Horst and teammate Florian Gosch represented Austria at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. His career highlights include a 5th place showing at the Beijing Games, a 2nd place at the 2009 European Beach Volleyball Championships in Sochi, Russia, and a 2nd place at the Stare Jablonki Grand Slam in Poland in 2012. 2007 In his first full season playing with big blocker Gosch, the results were very positive including ninth-place positions at the Grand Slam in Stavenger, Norway, the Beach Volleyball World Championships in Gstaad, Switzerland and the European Beach Volleyball Championships in Spain. With 2 other 9th-place finishes at open tournaments along with a bronze medal at √Öland, Finland, the team of Gosch-Horst was well on its way to olympic qualification. 2008 A disappointing season with no top 10 finishes up until the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. In the games, they overcame possible elimination in the lucky loser bracket to post a very solid 5th-place finish in eventually losing to the Brazilian silver medalists, Marcio and Fabio. 2009 A very good season with 7 top 10 finishes and then topping it off with a silver medal at the European Beach Volleyball Championships in Sochi, Russia. 2010 Best finishes in 2010 include a 7th place showing early in the season in Shanghai, and a 4th-place finish in Marseille World Series in July. This in his last season playing with Gosch who would have to retire at the end of the season due to knee complications. 2011 After the retirement of Gosch, Horst played on the 2011 FIVB World Beach Volleyball Tour with new partner and beach volleyball rookie Daniel M√ºllner. Their best showing was a 17th place in the 2011 Beach Volleyball World Championships in Rome. On 21 October 2011 the pair officially announced their split. Speculation began immediately of an Alexander Horst / Clemens Doppler duo, who also split from his partner on the same day. Horst and Doppler would go on to announce their partnership 2 weeks later. 2012 The season started out at the Myslowice Open in Poland. Horst and Doppler placed a solid 7th place to kick off the new season. Between mixed results in the FIVB World Tour and the 2012 CEV European Championships, Horst and Doppler posted a hometown win in Baden, Austria. However, their best success in the 2012 season was grabbing a last-minute spot in the 2012 Summer Olympics qualification round in Moscow on 1 July. The pair had a heartbreaking pool play loss to the Swiss Heuscher/Bellaguarda in the 2012 Summer Olympics, ending their olympic hopes in pool play at 19th place. One week after the Olympics, the Austrian duo rebounded for a silver team medal, beating the season's world champions Gibb/Rosenthal for their best showing on the FIVB tour by an Austrian men's pair ever.

In 1824, after Mexico gained independence, a second group of Yowani received permission to establish villages in Texas.Correspondence Between General Manuel Mier y Ter√°n and Texas 1828-1832 The Yowani gradually abandoned their original Mississippi homelands.

They wanted to be included in registration for the Dawes Commission Final Rolls as citizens by blood of the Choctaw Nation and recognized by the federal government.

Thompson, et al. vs. Choctaw Nation, MCR File 341, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Muskogee, Oklahoma A long political struggle ensued between 1898 and 1909, as the Choctaw leaders of Indian Territory did not want the long-absent Yowani to receive any of their land.

The word in Choctaw is believed to have meant \\"caterpillar,\\" likely common at that site. The Choctaw people had established Yowani along the Chickasawhay River.Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico By Frederick Webb Hodge, Smithsonian Institution American Ethnology, Washington, D. C.: Government Printing Office, 1907, pgs 1001-1002, ; 13:978-0313212819 The Choctaw are believed to be descended from the Mississippian culture, who had numerous large settlements along the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the Ohio Valley and Southeast. French colonists established settlements at Biloxi (now Mississippi) and Mobile (in present-day Alabama). Over time, the Yowani band expanded its territory westward to the eastern dividing ridge of Bogue Homa, then northward as far as present-day Pachuta Creek. From this point, their territory ran south to the confluence of the Chickasawhay and Buckatunna rivers. To the east, their lands extended into present-day jurisdictions of Greene and Choctaw counties in Alabama, bordering on the Muscogee (also known as the Creek Nation). By 1764, a group of Yowani had moved west into Louisiana, where they established contact with the Koasati and Caddo indigenous peoples. Over time, the Yowani adopted Caddo customs and the groups became very interlinked by marriage. By the 20th century, the American anthropologist James Mooney listed the Yowani as one of the thirteen divisions of the Caddo Confederacy. Moving westward At the time that the Yowani ventured into Louisiana, the territory had been under Spanish control since 1763, when France ceded it after defeat by Great Britain in the Seven Years' War, fought both in Europe and North America. In 1800, Spain traded Louisiana back to France. After Napoleon briefly attempted to re-establish control over Saint-Domingue, with visions of empire in North America, he sold the mainland territory in 1803 to the United States as what they called the Louisiana Purchase. It doubled the area of the new nation. Many of the ethnic French residents of Louisiana, and many of the Indian tribes, did not want to be ruled by the United States. Spain agreed to allow several Indian tribes, including the Yowani Choctaw and the Alabama-Coushatta, to relocate to the neighboring Spanish colonial province of Texas. Other Indian tribes later emigrated to Texas to avoid the Americans; these included some Cherokee, Muscogee-Creek, Seminole, Shawnee, Delaware, Quapaw, Kickapoo and Miami Indians.\\"Texas Indian Papers 1825-1845\\", Texas State Library and Archives, Austin, Texas Following the Mexican War of Independence from Spain, Mexico assumed control of Texas. In 1824, another group of Yowani, led by Atahobia, petitioned the Mexican government to settle within the province of Texas. They were given permission to establish several villages east of the Trinity River and west of the border with Louisiana. During the period between 1810 and 1836, many of the relocated tribes, including the Yowani Choctaw, were often subject to attacks from the Comanche who roamed the western part of Texas. The Lipan Apache, located in the southern part of the province, also attacked them. The Yowani often joined forces with the English-speaking settlers for self-defense against these nomadic tribes. By 1832, all but two families had left the traditional Yowani lands in Mississippi to migrate west.Frederick Webb Hodge, ed., Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico (2 vols., Washington: GPO, 1907, 1910, rpt., New York: Pageant, 1959 Although some settled briefly in what is now Rapides Parish, Louisiana, by 1850 many of the Yowani had settled with other Choctaw in the Chickasaw Nation in Indian Territory. This area had been established during Indian Removal of the 1830s, when the US forced tribes from the East to west of the Mississippi River, exchanging lands and arranging payments or annuities in some instances. The Yowani remaining in east Texas joined with other remnant peoples to form a part of what is now recognized as the Mount Tabor Indian Community. In Louisiana, they were closely related to the remaining Coushatta and the Jena Band of Choctaw. Texas Indian Wars 1835‚Äì1843 In 1835, English-speaking settlers and some anti-Santa Anna Tejanos in Texas launched the Texas Revolution to gain independence from Mexico.Eugene C. Barker and James W. Pohl, \\"Texas Revolution\\", Handbook of Texas Online The provisional Texas government sent Sam Houston, a man much respected by the Cherokee, to negotiate a treaty with the Indians living in East Texas. They concluded a treaty at Bowles Village on February 23, 1836, between the Cherokee and Twelve Associated Tribes and the provisional Texas government. This treaty was the first in an attempt to form an inter-tribal community in which the Choctaw were fully involved.\\"Treaty of Bowles Village, February 23, 1836,\\" Texas State Library and Archives, Austin, Texas In March 1836, the Republic of Texas was established, gaining full independence from Mexico the following month. Elected the first president of the Republic, Houston continued to negotiate peace with the various Indian tribes. After 1837, the Yowani combined settlements to form a single village on Attoyac Bayou in extreme southeastern Rusk County.Texas Indian Papers, Census of Tribes, Texas State library and Archives, Austin, Texas An 1837 census of Indians in the Republic of Texas noted that 70 Yowani Choctaw lived in this village, along with several Chickasaw. The census also noted that these people were peaceable. The Texas Legislature refused to ratify many of Houston's treaties. The second president of the Republic, Mirabeau Lamar, did not share Houston's respect for the native tribes, and refused to honor Houston's treaties.Herbert Gambrell, \\"Mirabeau Bonaparte Lamar\\", Handbook of Texas Online,Thomas H. Kreneck, \\"Samuel Houston\\", Handbook of Texas Online New settlers to the region often settled or encroached on lands that had been granted to Indian tribes, and some tribes retaliated against them.Killough Massacre, by Christopher Long, Handbook of Texas Online, In the summer of 1839, Lamar ordered the Texian Army to attack Cherokee villages.Handbook of Texas online, Cherokee War The Americans eventually drove the Cherokee out of Texas; some went to Indian Territory, where the Cherokee Nation had relocated, and others to northern Mexico. Several small Cherokee bands escaped detection and removal. One small band, led by Chicken Trotter, also known by his birth name of Devereaux Jarrett Bell, tried to regain some of their lands in 1840.The 1840 Census of the Republic of Texas, 1966 Pemberton Press, Austin, Texas, Edited by Gifford White, Nacogdoches County While his petition was pending in the Republic legislature, Bell and several other Cherokee were involved in an altercation with three white men near Nacogdoches. The resulting scuffle resulted in the deaths of the three whites. Fearing hostility of other whites, Bell led his group to Monclova, Coahuila, Mexico. Angry at the death of the three white men, a vigilante group formed in Nacogdoches. Unable to catch up to Bell and his group, the vigilantes attacked the nearby Yowani village, massacring some eleven Choctaw men, women, and children.Handbook of Texas Online, Indians, Texas and Mexican Republics, by George Klos After the attack, the Yowani Choctaw abandoned their village. Some returned to Mississippi and others moved to Indian Territory to join the Chickasaw Nation.Some East Texas Native Families: Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands Genealogy Project: Rootsweb Global Search: Familyties A third group joined the Caddo at the Brazos Reservation\\"Caddo, Twenty Years Without A Home\\", Texas Beyond History further west, and eventually accompanied the Caddo to a reservation in Indian Territory. A fourth group, led by Woody Jones, chose to remain in East Texas, moving further into the piney woods to avoid detection by Texas military forces. Throughout Lamar's term as president, the Republic of Texas conducted a policy of attrition against various groups of Natives, including those under Chicken Trotter/Bell. He launched a guerrilla campaign against Texans. When Lamar's term expired, Sam Houston was elected to a second term as president. Houston began treaty negotiations with the tribes, culminating in the Treaty of Birds Fort, which was concluded on September 29, 1843. This treaty ended most hostilities in Texas with the tribes who had migrated to Texas decades before. Although the Yowani were not a direct party to it, they had several ties to those in attendance. Many of the displaced tribes, including some Yowani Choctaw, formed a new community, Mount Tabor Indian Community. Many Yowani continued to live under the authority of Woody Jones in Houston County near the border with Trinity County.Department of the Interior, Office of Indian Affairs correspondence between A. C. Tonner, Acting Commissioner for the Dawes Commission, and the Secretary of the Interior, April 29, 1904; ref. Land 25846-1904, Oklahoma Historical Society, Oklahoma City Mount Tabor Indian Community The Mount Tabor Indian Community formed following the purchase of 10,000 acres of land in Rusk County by Benjamin Franklin Thompson in the spring of 1844. Acting on behalf of the Cherokee, Thompson was the American husband of Annie Martin, a Cherokee and daughter of John Martin, first Chief Justice of the Cherokee Nation. These Cherokee were joined by those who had been a part of the original Texas Cherokee Nation and removed to Monclova, Coahuila, Mexico.Grant Foreman, History of the Five Civilized Tribes, University of Oklahoma Press, 1934 The Mount Tabor community continued to grow after Texas joined the United States in 1845. President James K. Polk in 1844 granted permission to both members of the Ridge Party and the Old Settlers of the Cherokee, who had political differences with the Cherokee Nation, to relocate from Indian Territory to Mount Tabor.Texas Indian Papers 1835-1845, Texas State Archives, Austin, Texas The community was named by John Adair Bell, a Cherokee signer of the Treaty of New Echota.Cherokee Cavaliers by Litton and Dale, page 80 More Yowani Choctaw, led by Atahobia's grandson Archibald Thompson and Nashoba's grandson Jeremiah Jones, relocated to the Mount Tabor Indian Community before 1850.1850 United States Census, State of Texas, Canton Beat Enumeration District, Smith County These were followed by McIntosh Creek Indians, led by brothers William and Thomas Berryhill, also before 1850.1850 United States Census, State of Texas, Rusk County Civil War When the American Civil War erupted, almost all of the people living at Mount Tabor supported the Confederacy. It had promised the Native American tribes a state of their own if the Confederacy won the war. Many enlisted in the Confederate Army as part of the Cherokee Mounted Rifles under Stand Watie, who was commissioned as a high-ranking officer. During the war, two other Cherokee communities formed in Texas. These were mainly for the protection of Confederate soldiers families. Besides Rusk County, another Cherokee community formed near present-day Waco, as well as one in Wood County near Quitman. The Wood County group consisted of both Cherokee and Choctaw. While a few of the Mount Tabor Yowani enlisted with the Cherokee Mounted Rifles, most became part of the Texas 14th Cavalry under John Martin Thompson. The war took a heavy toll on the community, as nearly one-quarter of all male residents were dead by the end of the war. Dawes Commission Between 1866 and the close of the Dawes Commission Final Rolls in the early 20th century, 80% of the Cherokee left Mount Tabor to return north to the Cherokee Nation. Most of the Texas Choctaw stayed in Texas, with a few relocating to the Chickasaw Nation. Only during the period of registration in the Dawes Rolls under the Commission, when members registered to be eligible for allotments of communal land, did a number of Choctaw take the opportunities available and move north. A handful settled in Atoka in the Choctaw Nation. One family moved to Tuskahoma. The majority moved into Pickens County in the Chickasaw Nation near present-day Marlow, Oklahoma. Many of the Yowani Choctaw from Texas sought to register on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes as Citizens by Blood in the Choctaw Nation. Because of their long residence in Texas, the Choctaw Nation officially opposed them and challenged theirs and other registrations. In 1906, 70 members of the Yowani Choctaw who lived in Texas were stricken from the membership rolls of the Choctaw Nation. William C. Thompson and his cousin John Thurston Thompson, Jr. were among them, and sued to be reinstated. In 1909, the United States Supreme Court ruled in their favor, saying that the Texas Choctaw should be reinstated. Recent years Throughout the twentieth century, there have been a number strong leaders among the Texas Choctaw community within the overall Mount Tabor Indian Community, which has been recognized as a tribe by the state. These include William Clyde Thompson and Martin Luther Thompson, who helped gain registration for their peoples as citizens \\"by Blood\\" in the Choctaw Nation. They also helped to keep the Texas community viable. The Cherokee predominated by number in the group and generally led the community. No Choctaw was selected as Chairman of the Executive Committee before 1988. When the Cherokee Nation adopted its 1975 constitution, it excluded the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands-Mount Tabor Indian Community as a band or affiliate of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, although they had been considered so during the earlier part of the 20th century.1973 Proposed Constitution of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma Cherokee who remained in Texas were no longer recognized formally as part of a tribe or as Native Americans by the Federal Government.

Terry was descended from Arthur Thompson, brother of William Clyde Thompson. Terry was the first woman to hold the position and the first who did not have Cherokee blood. Terry was Choctaw, Chickasaw and Muscogee-Creek, and was the first person of Creek ancestry to head the community. In 2001, she was succeeded by Peggy Dean-Atwood, Choctaw and Chickasaw, a descendant of Archibald Thompson. In 2002, J.C. Thompson was then again chosen as Chairman and remained in that capacity until August 2018. He was succeeded by William Ellis \\"Billy\\" Bean. Chairman Bean is the great grandson of Mount Tabor Chief John Ellis Bean, an original enrollee on the Cherokee Old Settler payment roll. Chairman Bean was removed as Tribal Chairman by action of the Tribal Court for cause on September 2, 2019. He was replaced by Cheryl Giordano of Arp, who is of Choctaw-Chickasaw descent and had previously served as Operations Coordinator on the Executive Committee. She is assisted today by Deputy Chairman Rex Thompson, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee of Troup. The next tribal election is tentatively scheduled for October 2020. The Community is continuing to seek Federal Acknowledgment as an American Indian Tribe. On May 10, 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbot signed into law 84 SCR 25, recognizing the Mount Tabor Indian Community in Texas. The community adopted a new constitution in August 2017,2017 Constitution of the Mount Tabor Indian Community establishing a three-tier government made up of the five-member Executive Committee; a seven-member Tribal Council, and a three-member Tribal Court.

The major educational institutions in Kosgi mandal are: Schools in Kosgi are ZPHS, ZPHS (boys), ZPHS Girls (Urdu Medium), Shanthi Nikethan high school(EM), Govt. high school, Veda techno school, Rainbow high school, Krishnaveni Talent School, Panini High School, Govt. Junior college and Prajna junior college. Apart from these, the major schools in other parts of the mandal are ZPHS schools in Mirjapur, Gundumal, Mushrifa and Sarjkhan Pet. Higher secondary, Intermediate and higher education institutions are situated only in Kosgi town.  NGO support  Due to financial constraints the government of Telangana state has instituted a policy to actively seek private/NGO adoption of government schools. As part of this, the NGOs like Asha for education and Bhumi are helping to improve the education in Kosgi mandal. The silicon valley chapter of Asha organization is funding one of such project named Balavikas in Kosgi. The ground work is taken up by Bhumi. This project aims to improve infrastructure, and teaching quality in selected educational institutions in Kosgi.'PVRMES' is one of the NGO primarily donated a school building to Govt. Upper Primary School in Pothireddypally (vill) and the school was renamed to \\"Pullangari Venkat Reddy Memorial upper primary school\\" in the year of 2004.'PVRMES' then concentrated on delivering basic infrastructure,needs of poor student's in the constituency.  Migration  The declining economic feasibility of agriculture, and increasing debts of the farmers in Kosgi mandal has forced them to migrate to the metropolitan cities like Hyderabad and especially Mumbai, where they work mostly as laborer in construction work. The government's efforts, to restore the normal situation using projects like Self Help Groups and Food for Work programhttp://rural.nic.in/nffwpguidelines.htmhttp://rural.nic.in/annualrep0405/chapter2.pdf have been ineffective.http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2003060800160200.htm&date;=2003/06/08/&prd;=mag&  See also  Kodangal  References  Villages in Mahbubnagar district ","title":"Kosgi"},{"id":"18890896","text":"The obelisk of Theodosius I in Istanbul. The Obelisk of Theodosius () is the Ancient Egyptian obelisk of Pharaoh Thutmose III re-erected in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (known today as At Meydanƒ± or Sultanahmet Meydanƒ±, in the modern city of Istanbul, Turkey) by the Roman emperor Theodosius I in the 4th century AD. History The obelisk was erected during the 18th dynasty by Pharaoh Thutmose III (1479‚Äì1425 BC) to the south of the seventh pylon of the great temple of Karnak. The Roman emperor Constantius II (337‚Äì361 AD) had it and another obelisk transported along the river Nile to Alexandria to commemorate his ventennalia or 20 years on the throne in 357. The other obelisk was erected on the spina of the Circus Maximus in Rome in the autumn of that year, and is now known as the Lateran Obelisk. The obelisk that would become the obelisk of Theodosius remained in Alexandria until 390; when Theodosius I (379‚Äì395 AD) had it transported to Constantinople and put up on the spina of the Hippodrome there.Labib Habachi, The Obelisks of Egypt, skyscrapers of the past, American University in Cairo Press, 1985, p.145-151. Description Obelisk The Obelisk of Theodosius is of red granite from Aswan and was originally 30m tall, like the Lateran Obelisk. The lower part was damaged in antiquity, probably during its transport or re-erection, and so the obelisk is today only 18.54m (or 19.6m) high, or 25.6m if the base is included. Between the four corners of the obelisk and the pedestal are four bronze cubes, used in its transportation and re-erection.E.A. Wallis Budge, Cleopatra's Needles and Other Egyptian Obelisks, The Religious Tract Society, London, 1926, reprinted 1990, p.160-165. Each of its four faces has a single central column of inscription, celebrating Thutmose III's victory over the Mitanni which took place on the banks of the Euphrates in about 1450 BC.

Missing pieces have been replaced, at the pedestal's bottom corners, by cubes of porphyry resting on the bronze cubes already mentioned ‚Äì the bronze and porphyry cubes are of identical form and dimensions. There is also a vertical gash up one of the obelisk's faces, which looks like a canal from above. These repairs to the base may be linked to the cracking of the obelisk itself after its suffering a serious accident (perhaps an earthquake) at an unknown date in antiquity.

File:Obelisk of Theodosius 1234.jpgObelisk of Theodosius Erecting the obelisk Inscriptions Latin inscription (east face) The pedestal's east face bears an inscription in five Latin hexameters. This is slightly broken at the bottom but it was transcribed in full by travellers in the 16th century.

The game was originally called Grand Racer, but was renamed to avoid confusion with another early Saturn game, Gale Racer. It is a spiritual sequel to the 1993 computer game CyberRace; the two games share a similar theme, and vehicles designed by Syd Mead. Regional differences The game had different soundtracks depending on the region: one by Nextech's Kohji Hayama in Japan and Europe, and another by rock band Bygone Dogs in the United States. Reception Cyber Speedway received generally mediocre reviews. While critics remarked that the graphics are good and that the two-player split screen mode is a welcome treat, especially given that the Saturn's flagship racer Daytona USA is single-player only, they found fault with the gameplay, particularly the hovercraft handling. Rad Automatic of Sega Saturn Magazine argued that the vehicle's lack of traction is an inaccurate depiction of hovercraft physics, while a reviewer for Maximum felt that the hovercraft concept was a poor one to begin with, since hovercraft handle identically on all surfaces, making for \\"a predictable, tedious ride.\\" A GamePro critic commented that the game was fun to play but lacked longevity, since all the tracks are easy to master and elements such as the crude cinematics in story mode limit the game's replay appeal. Next Generation reviewed the Saturn version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Gran Chaser is good fun, if not all together great.\\" References External links * Cyber Speedway at GameFAQs 1995 video games Futuristic racing games Multiplayer and single-player video games Nex Entertainment games Sega video games Sega Saturn games Sega Saturn-only games Split-screen multiplayer games Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Cyber Speedway"},{"id":"18890939","text":"Fire in the Wind is the ninth studio album by the folk artist John Stewart, former member of the Kingston Trio.

Ltd. was a Canadian company founded in 1949 by entrepreneur Frank McMahon who saw an enormous opportunity to supply natural gas to the huge industrial and residential markets in the United States. In 1949, through a special Act of the Parliament of Canada, he incorporated Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. whose business plan included the construction of a 650-mile gas pipeline from Taylor in north-eastern British Columbia to the United States. McMahon personally began lobbying the Canadian and American governments to remove their restrictions on the export and import of natural gas. After exhaustive efforts he succeeded and in 1955 construction began on the Westcoast Pipeline, Canada's first \\"big-inch\\" pipeline. Along with its gathering system, processing plants and compressor stations were completed in the fall of 1957. In 1964, Westcoast Transmission built another processing plant at Fort Nelson, British Columbia in support of an additional 250-mile line to the company's new discoveries in the Canadian Northwest. In 1974, Westcoast Tramsmission created Foothills Pipeline Ltd., a subsidiary company established to build and operate the Canadian portions of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System. Westcoast sold the company's natural gas distribution subsidiary, Centra Gas Manitoba, to Manitoba Hydro in 1999. After McMahon's death in 1986, Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. was renamed Westcoast Energy Inc., and in 2002 Duke Energy of Charlotte, North Carolina, acquired the company in a deal worth US$3.5 billion. The natural gas pipeline business was later spun off as part of Spectra Energy, which merged with Enbridge in 2017. References * Gray, Earle.

Biography  Szabados was born in Budapest. Even though he started performing in 1962, his rise to fame is generally considered to have started with his quintet winning the renowned San Sebastian Jazz Festival Grand Prize in the free jazz category in 1972. His first album that was recorded with a quartet in 1975 was entitled Wedding. Despite the abstraction of the music, the record was well received in Hungary and abroad, thereby setting the scene for his subsequent albums. International recognition is probably noted by including the album in The Essential Jazz Records compiled by Max Harrison, Eric Thacker and Stuart Nicholson (Volume 2: Modernism to Postmodernism). Even though he could not record again until 1983, he maintained his status by establishing the Kass√°k Workshop for Contemporary Music, in which a new generation of musicians acquired a free and intuitive manner of playing jazz, with a distinct Hungarian sound. Generally, his collaborators would make up the next generation of Hungarian jazz, including acclaimed saxophone player Mih√°ly Dresch. Further international recognition followed in the 1980s, through his collaboration with Anthony Braxton on their duo record Szabraxtondos. In Hungary, he proceeded to form MAKUZ, or the Royal Hungarian Court Orchestra, which membership varied, but always consisted of at least nine musicians that were committed to free, improvised music. Subsequently, he still collaborated with Roscoe Mitchell on their 1998 record Jelen√©s (Revelation) and again with Braxton and Vladimir Tarasov this time for the live recording Triotone. He was awarded the Kossuth Prize, the most prestigious cultural award in Hungary, in 2011 by the President of Hungary. He died in Nagymaros on 10 June 2011.  Influences  Szabados' work and thinking is distinctly placed in Hungarian culture. Most importantly, a good deal of his music is influenced by Hungarian folk music, mainly from Transylvania. Apart from direct folk associations, this influenced on Szabados' work was to a great extent mediated through the work of Hungarian composer B√©la Bart√≥k (1881‚Äì1945), who pioneered the reintegration of folk tradition in classical by his numerous field recordings. As he formulated it himself: > 'Apart from the occasional moments, it is difficult to find traces of > Bart√≥k's music in our music. Hungarian music has such characteristic > features that, when they appear, they are immediately linked to Bart√≥k, > whereas the real kinship is not with Bart√≥k but, on a much deeper level, > with Hungarian music, a world view, and a special taste' Apart from folk influences in his work, Szabados always gave clear references to other key instances of Hungarian culture. His 1983 record Adyton, for instance, is partially a reference to Hungarian poet Endre Ady, whereas his 1989 album A szarvass√° v√°lt fiak (Sons that became deer) was inspired by the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Choosing the word Adyton as a title for his record also shows the Szabados' philosophical thinking about his music. A documentary film about his work was issued by Duna TV.

Mendillo is an American investor, endowment fund manager, and philanthropist. She was the president and chief executive officer of the Harvard Management Company, charged with managing Harvard University's endowment. She led the investment team from 2008 to 2014, when the endowment was valued at $36.4 billion, having recovered fully from the impact of the global financial crisis. Prior to leading the company, from 1987-2002, she was in charge of managing the endowment's domestic equities, venture capital, natural resources investments and charitable trusts. After 15 years in various investment positions at Harvard Management Company, in 2002 she was tapped to be the chief investment officer at Wellesley College. She left Wellesley in 2008, leaving the endowment at $1.67 billion (up from its 2002 market value of $1.03 billion). In the summer of 2008, she returned to Harvard Management as President and CEO. Her time at Harvard was marked by the financial crisis of 2007-2008, during which the University was under severe financial strain, and the endowment came under significant pressure to provide substantial liquidity and perform. In 2009, Forbes Magazine's 100 Most Powerful Women List placed Mendillo as number 37, before Margaret Chan and after Hillary Clinton.  Early life and education  Jane Mendillo was born in New Britain, Connecticut. She earned a BA in English from Yale College in 1980 and an MBA from the Yale School of Management in 1984.  Investment career  Previous to her graduating with a M.B.A. she worked in the office of investments at Yale University from 1980 to 1982. During 1983, she worked with Lord Abbett in New York as an equities analyst. Jane Mendillo was a management consultant with Bain & Company in Boston from 1984 to 1987.  Harvard beginnings  Jane was employed by the Harvard Management Company from 1987-2001. She occupied various roles, including vice president of external management, in which she had investment responsibility for $7 billion in Harvard assets, including $6 billion in externally managed investments for the Harvard endowment, and $1 billion in Harvard pension and related accounts. Jane's other positions at Harvard Management included domestic equities investment, venture capital investment, and the management and investment of charitable trusts and gifts.  Wellesley's endowment  After fifteen years at Harvard she was tapped by Wellesley College in 2002 to create and lead their investment team. She was the chief investment officer at Wellesley College from 2002 to 2008 and was responsible for the investment policy and management of the College's endowment. During her tenure the college's endowment increased from $1.03 billion to $1.67 billion USD.  Return to Harvard's endowment  Mendillo spent 21 years at the Harvard Management Company, leaving in 2014 as its chief executive officer. She returned to Harvard as its president and chief executive officer on July 1, 2008 and was responsible for directing its $36.9 billion endowment. She assumed leadership of the endowment management team just before the 2008 financial crisis and is credited with kept the university's liquidity above water, although the investments suffered a sharp 27.3% decrease in market value in her first year at the helm. As markets recovered in 2010 and 2011, the endowment posted positive returns of 11%, and 21%, respectively. A the end of fiscal year 2011 as reported by the college's magazine, the endowment had recovered substantially, increasing from $27.6 billion to $32.0 billion, while simultaneously providing hundred of millions of dollars to the University's budget. At the conclusion of the 2014 fiscal year the endowment posted a gain of +15.4%, increasing its value to $36.4 billion, the largest in among all US Universities. The endowment over her tenure exceeded both the University's long term target returns and its market benchmarks. It was reported that her compensation from 2008 to 2014 rose significantly, starting at approximately $2.5 million, eventually leading to a compensation package of $13.8 million in 2014. She retired from managing Harvard's endowment in 2014.

In 1983 was acquired by Contel Business Systems. In 1989 Contel Business Systems merged with NDS and became VERSYSS. CADO was formed by former staff of McDonnell- Douglas Information Systems. CADO was based in Torrance Ca. and had a manufacturing plant and systems software engineering team in Cork, Ireland. Business model Contel and CADO focused their marketing on vertical markets. The computers and operating systems were tailored to rapid development and deployment of market-specific applications for small businesses, including: * Finance (General Ledger, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable) * Wholesale distribution (Inventory, Point of Sales, Sales Analysis) * Travel (Ticketing, Passenger Management) * Medical (Billing, Patient Records) CADO Systems was one of the first manufacturer of (Intel) microcomputer-based business system with disk drives, application software, a compiler for the proprietary (BASIC-like) interpreted language \\"CADOL\\". The first prototype used an 8008 and sprang to life in 1973. By 1975, CADO was selling computers. The first systems built were the 8080 \\"/1\\" systems with 3 KB of main memory and an 8-inch floppy drive. They could handle one serial port connected to one CRT-based terminal with keyboard - one user. By the late seventies, these had grown into the /4 systems with 16, 32 and later 48 KB of memory. These multitasked by using a hardware tick to XOR the base address of where the native (\\"CADOL\\" a basic like-) interpreter took instructions from. These also used 8085 processors. The memory switching trick was done with proprietary hardware. The \\"/4\\" system had four serial ports, therefore four terminals, therefore four users. They could also be connected to modems instead and spoke various protocols such as X.25. The /8 was two /4s sharing a common (hard) disk drive. It was effectively an eight-user system built out of two 8085s. Around the time of the /8, development the CADO CAT computer came into being. It looked like a fruit-coloured iMac, but it was 20 years earlier. It had an integrated CRT and disk drives, which by that time (1981) had been shrunk to 5 inches wide and could fit inside the CRT enclosure. Earlier CADO computers used external hard drives, all of which were quite large. The CAT product line consisted of: * CAT I * CAT II * CAT III The CAT III was a three- user system. The primary user sat at the CAT III system console, which contained the CPU, floppy drive, and hard disk. Other users connected to the system by way of serial terminals. By the end of the CAT series, over 25,000 systems and 200,000 terminals were manufactured. If the CAT had had a bit- mapped display, it would have seemed like the first Apple Macintosh without the Xerox GUI. The terminals were proprietary also: they were similar to standard VT terminals, but with custom firmware programming to support input commands (protected fields). All CADO systems up to that point had the system and CADOL interpreter reside in EPROM, so as soon as power was applied it read track 0 sector 0 of the diskette and began executing CADOL code. The IL codes for the interpreter written by Jim Ferguson looked similar to Tannenbaum's optimized IL codes from his empirical study. The language was extended by Richard Sexton, who added Pascal/C like syntax and 65 KB instead of 256 byte program overlay sizes. Previous to that, CADOL worked in programs no longer than 256 bytes of IL code long and when the programmers had code that hit about the 200-byte mark they would have to issue a LOAD statement to load the next 256 bytes of CADOL IL codes. At some point when a fair number of applications had been written, the loading of overlays was made transparent by Sexton's modifications to the interpreter up to an apparent program of 65 KB. Dan Lanham rewrote the compiler. This was all done in Intel 8085 assembly. After the /8, the technical staff wanted to gang more of these machines together, but the marketing department demanded 16-bit systems. The Motorola 68000 was the preferred choice of software people, but Bob Thorne, VP of hardware, delivered the bad news: Motorola only had a great CPU while Intel had a CPU and chipset family of CTCs, interrupt controllers, serial ports, DMA controllers and x86 became the rule much to the shock and horror of the software staff, who thought Thorne should just build all those bits he didn't have. But Bob was instead working on two disk controllers as these were not off the shelf chips quite yet. One design, not used was based on 8x300 bipolar parts but it never saw the light of day. The 16-bit 8086 tiger systems began development in Intel development systems as there were no working commercial 8086-based computers at the time. The Tiger was radically different. All previous CADO computers had been single-board systems that would probably be familiar to anybody who has ever seen a modern motherboard; the parts were just bigger, and there were fewer of them. But the Tiger looked more like a DEC computer - it had a (Multibus) backplane that would hold up to 10 plug-in cards into this mainframe, and was one of if not the first multi- microprocessor based mainframe systems. There were three plug-in cards: the \\"terminal\\" card had an 8086 chip and 16 serial ports, the \\"cpu\\" card had the (8086) cpu that ran CADOL III and an optional disk processor used an 8089. One had to have one cpu card, one terminal card although you could have many of these in increments of 16 serial ports, later also in increments of 8 ports. With the 8086 came the net and around 1984 or 1986 CADO connected to the UUCP- based Usenet news and mail networks and finally had a UNIX system, requisitioned to run mail and news which engineering considered vital while the rest of the company had no idea what it was. Before the first Tiger was sold though, George Ryan, the founder of the company, left and the IBM PC came out. And this was in many ways the end of CADO. At one time one of the fastest growing companies in California, CADO was then sold to/merged with Contel. In 1983, Contel introduced the Tiger ATS line of computers. These consisted of: * Tiger 8 * Tiger 16 * Tiger 32 * Tiger 64 The numbers designated how many users could connect to the machine at once. The chassis size ranged from a little larger than a breadbox (Tiger 8) to the size of a small household refrigerator (Tiger 64). The Tiger 32 and Tiger 64 models used multiple 8086 and 8089 processors to manage user requests. In 1989, VERSYSS introduced the VERSYSS/Solution 1 line of computers. These differed dramatically from earlier systems. Instead of a completely proprietary hardware solution and operating systems, these were based on commodity components. The operating system was a variant of AT&T;'s SYSVR3. To provide backward-compatibility with older applications, the older MMOS was run on proprietary boards connected to the system bus. Thus, users were completely unaware that they were using a Unix system. * VS/1 model 150 * VS/1 model 250 * VS/1 model 500 In 1993, VERSYSS partnered with IBM to port their MMOS to the RS/6000 line of systems. At that point, almost all proprietary hardware requirements were dropped except the terminal firmware.  Other Products  In 1985 Contel produced the CADOS emulator to run CADO software on standard IBM PC hardware.  References  * Kent, Allen.

She was portrayed by Wendy Drew from the series first episode on April 2, 1956 until September 1960 and by Patricia Bruder from December 1960 until November 1998. Casting Wendy Drew initially played Ellen from 1956 until 1960, when Patricia Bruder took over the role. When Drew requested to be released from her contract as she was getting married, the fictional Ellen was sent away on a cruise, and returned played by Bruder. Bruder appeared in As the World Turns for 35 years. Alongside Eileen Fulton and Don Hastings, who played Lisa Grimaldi and Bob Hughes respectively, Bruder was one of the serial's longest-serving cast members. In 1990, a party was organised to honor the longevity of these and other cast members, and viewers were invited to attend to the event. In 1995, Bruder was \\"let go\\" from the serial. In 1998, Bruder returned to the serial to play Ellen once again. Development As The World Turns initially focused on two families: the Hugheses and the Lowells.Matelski 1988, p.70. Ellen's father, Jim Lowell (Les Damon), was one of the soap's original protagonists. An early plot featured an affair between Jim and Edith Hughes (Ruth Warrick). Creator Irna Phillips had intended to contravene the typical format of soap opera storylines by allowing the affair to lead to a happy marriage, however ultimately killed Jim off instead. This resulted in younger members of the Lowell and Hughes families, including Ellen, being brought to the forefront of storylines.Museum of Television & Radio 1997, p.132. Ellen had been horrified by her father's affair, and as Marilyn J. Matelski writes in The Soap Opera Evolution, this, alongside her doubt as to whether her parents truly loved her, set Ellen on a \\"somewhat reckless [path ... seeking] love and security from any source\\".Matelski 1988, p.72. In 1958, Ellen became pregnant by Dr. Tim Cole (William Redfield) and subsequently gave their son up for adoption. According to The Daytime Serials of Television, 1946‚Äì1960, she was the first major character in any serial to have an illegitimate child.Cox 2006, p.163. Lynda Hirsch of the Youngstown Vindicator summarised Ellen's following storylines: The Stewarts became a prominent family in the serial in the 1960s, and members of the Lowell family were written out in their favor. David and Ellen had two daughters together, Carol Ann and Dawn; the roles of their family unit increased during this period.Schemering 1985, p.31. Over the course of the decade, Ellen's son Dan Stewart was rapidly aged. When Bruder joined the serial in 1960, both she and Ellen were in their early twenties. By 1966, Dan was also in his twenties‚Äîhis portrayer John Colenback was only a year younger than Bruder. Bruder's costume and in-character appearance were altered to complement Ellen's aging. Copious amounts of grey powder were used, and she began dressing in old fashioned outfits and wearing her hair in a French twist. In 1979, Jon Reed of the Star-Banner described Ellen as \\"matronly\\", and reported that Bruder wore little make-up, and applied white powder to her hair. For a brief period in 1980, Bruder tried styling Ellen's hair after her own and wearing it loose. She changed it back, however, after receiving dozens of letters from viewers who felt that the style was inappropriate given the \\"mother image\\" which Ellen had gained. Reception In 1988, Mary Anne Cooper of The Madison Courier described Ellen as one of the serial's \\"popular characters\\". In one storyline Ellen discovers that she has been caring for her long-lost son. Michael Maloney of The Huffington Post questioned the chances of someone babysitting an infant and it turning out to be their long-lost child. He noted that the character then went through a series of \\"trials and tribulations\\" in her unsuccessful battle to gain custody of Dan. He opined that Ellen and David were \\"one of Oakdale's more stable duos\\" and that the \\"bouffant hairdo\\" was a trademark of the character's image. In 1982, a columnist for The Tuscaloosa News said that \\"Ellen Stewart has had many problems lately\\" and that she really needed a friend in the series. They said the serial came up with \\"the best\\" when they cast Betsy Palmer as her best friend, Suzanne Becker.
