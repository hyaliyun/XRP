It was directed by Jack Hannah and features the voices of Clarence Nash as Donald, and Jimmy MacDonald and Dessie Flynn as Chip and Dale. Plot Chip and Dale are not able to find enough acorns to store up for the winter. The chipmunks then see Donald Duck, working as a park ranger, beginning to seed a clearing in the oak forest. Seeing his large sack of acorns, they set out to steal it. They manage to make off with the entire sack, but Donald easily takes it from them just as they enter the ground entrance to their tree. He then places a box trap (baited with an acorn) which successfully ensnares both chipmunks despite Chip being fully aware of the ruse. While the chipmunks argue with each other, Donald looks on amused and provokes them to fight. Finally the chipmunks see Donald and run for the acorns. Donald stands in front of the tree entrance to keep the acorns from going inside. Chip and Dale then pick up hockey sticks. Using teamwork and natural hockey skills, the chipmunks beat Donald at his favorite sport, and finally flatten him with an overwhelming acorn \\"stampede\\". A dazed Donald hits in one last acorn and laughs at the chipmunks as if he has beaten them. Dale concludes that Donald has lost his mind.

A bookie acquires an interest in an art gallery. Plot Lucky Cullen (Milton Berle) gets into trouble when his boss, bookie Tony Miller (Cesar Romero), finds out that Lucky has bet (and lost) $5000 under a false identity. Tony gives Lucky 24 hours to settle the debt. Lucky learns that he has inherited a Fifth Avenue art gallery from his uncle. When he and Tony check it out, however, Helen Mason (Carole Landis) informs them that the business is so far in debt it is worthless. Attracted to Helen, Tony cancels Lucky's debt in exchange for the gallery. He takes Helen out to dinner and gets her to start teaching him about art. When Tony finds gallery employee Stewart Haines (Richard Derr) kissing Helen, he sends Stewart on a buying trip to Europe. Meanwhile, Lucky is pestered by \\"Genius\\" (Elisha Cook, Jr.), a struggling painter. Just to get rid of him, Lucky gives him $10 for his abstract paintings. Thrilled, Genius returns again and again with more of his work. To Lucky's surprise, a patron later buys Genius's work. Trying to impress Helen, Tony buys a Rembrandt from Claire Barrington (Rose Hobart) for $20,000, only to have the gallery's art expert, Appleby (Francis Pierlot), unmask the painting as a very good fake. Tony confronts Claire and Gigi (J. Carrol Naish), the forger, and retrieves his money. Then he has an idea. Helen had told him about a missing Velasquez, Two Children in the Court. Tony gets Gigi to paint a copy. He then presents it to a thrilled Helen to sell at an auction at the gallery. Tony becomes concerned when government buyer Finchley enters the bidding. He orders Lucky to buy the painting, but Helen stops him, and Finchley gets the work for $84,000. Further complications arise when Stewart returns from his trip with Don Fernando (Steven Geray) and the genuine painting. After Lucky kidnaps Don Fernando, a worried Tony buys the work for $100,000, then switches it with Gigi's forgery, only to have the government expert dismiss it as a bad copy. Helen insists that other experts be brought in. While they wait, Tony confesses the truth to her. Meanwhile, Gigi substitutes his (much better) forgery, and the new experts are satisfied it is genuine. To show Helen that he is not in it for the money anymore, Tony donates it to the government free of charge. Tony gives the gallery to Helen and Stewart and returns to what he knows. Helen shows up at the racetrack and forgives him. Lucky then returns Tony's $100,000; he paid Don Fernando with counterfeit money.

It was formed in August 1941, and commenced flying the following month. Responsible for intermediate and advanced instruction of pilots under the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), the school was based at RAAF Station Mallala, South Australia, and operated Avro Anson and Airspeed Oxford aircraft. The school formed a reserve squadron for Australia's defence after the outbreak of war in the Pacific in December 1941. Having graduated over 2,000 pilots, No. 6 SFTS completed its final training course in September 1945, and was re-formed as Care and Maintenance Unit Mallala in January 1946. History RAAF aircrew training expanded dramatically following the outbreak of World War II, in response to Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war flight training facility, No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve Elementary Flying Training Schools (EFTS), eight Service Flying Training Schools (SFTS), and Central Flying School (CFS).Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 67–70Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942, p. 111 While CFS turned out new flight instructors, the EFTS provided basic training to prospective pilots who, if successful, would go on to an SFTS for further instruction that focussed on operational (or \\"service\\") flying.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942, p. 97 The course at SFTS typically consisted of two streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942, p. 109 The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew rose and fell. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944. alt=Twin-engined military monoplane lying on belly No. 6 Service Flying Training School (No. 6 SFTS) was formed at RAAF Station Mallala, South Australia, on 25 August 1941, under the control of No. 1 Training Group.RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 109–110 Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander N. Brearley. The school was reported to have cost £233,000–240,000 to establish. Inclement weather kept the airfield out of action until 19 September, when the first nine Avro Ansons arrived. The initial course of flying training commenced four days later. Delays owing to rain, fog and high winds, however, remained a constant hindrance throughout the school's existence. In addition to Ansons, the school operated Airspeed Oxfords. At least 11 fatalities were recorded during training flights.Avro Anson Accidents Part 14, p. 15 at National Archives of Australia. Retrieved on 30 May 2012. Two Ansons collided in mid-air on 14 October 1941, killing both pilots in each plane. Two other pilots died in separate Anson crashes in May 1942 and July 1943. All four crew members were killed when another Anson crashed on 23 September 1943. The school suffered its last fatality on 27 March 1944, when an Oxford went down with its pilot. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, the RAAF began classifying aircraft at SFTSs as Second Line (Reserve) elements in the defence of Australia.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942, pp. 234–238 No. 70 (Reserve) Squadron was formed at No. 6 SFTS, and was tasked with army cooperation, meteorological survey, and photo reconnaissance duties in the Adelaide vicinity. The RAAF rationalised its EATS facilities in March 1942, dividing the personnel and equipment of No. 3 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, between No. 6 SFTS and No. 1 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria.RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, p. 104 The last course at No. 6 SFTS concluded in September 1945, by which time 2,178 pilots had graduated. The school disbanded on 1 January 1946, re-forming as Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Mallala. CMU Mallala was one of 40 such units across Australia responsible for the storage of surplus aircraft awaiting sale, scrapping or stripping for spare parts.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 12–13 From June 1947, the base facilities constructed for No. 6 SFTS were occupied by RAAF units supporting the Long Range Weapons Project at Woomera Rocket Range.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 446–447 NotesReferences  6 Military units and formations established in 1941 Military units and formations disestablished in 1946 1946 disestablishments in Australia ","title":"No. 6 Service Flying Training School RAAF"},{"id":"36002559","text":"Kuldeep Singh Gangwar is a former Member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Kaimganj (2007-2012).

It measures approximately 34 kilometers in diameter and was named after Jürgen Rahe, a German-American astronomer and NASA science program director.  Description  The crater has an elongated shape measuring 35 km by 18 km and is the result of an oblique impact. A channel connects Rahe crater to the vicinity of the summit caldera of Ceraunius Tholus, with an interesting fan-shaped deposit at the lower end. Rahe Crater is 1 km deep in places, and was created by a low angle impact which is evident by its elongated shape and ejecta deposit in the shape of a “butterfly.”Gault, D. J. Wedekind. 1978.

Res. (Supp.) 88S, A785-A798. Rahe Crater is believed to once have held a lake. The lake was formed because heat from the nearby volcano Ceraunius Tholus melted glaciers. Melt water first collected in the caldera of Cerunius Tholus, and then spilled over the caldera rim forming a valley and the lake in Rahe Crater. The valley that carried the water was about 200 m wide. A delta formed where the valley entered Rahe Crater.Fassett, C. J. Head. 2007.

Life  Siebenhofer grew up in a working-class family in Kobenz, near the Styrian city of Knittelfeld. At the age of 16, he became an extreme sports athlete. He also began an apprenticeship and worked 7 years as an engineer/train driver for the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railway).  Extreme Sport 2000, first world record: From 8 April until 22 May, he initially climbed the Huascarán without any outside help. With its 6,785 meters, it is the highest mountain in Peru.

Entrepreneur  Siebenhofers former gyrocopter-base in HungaryEarly – 2005 – he became aware of so-called gyrocopters in Europe. He established the gyrocopter distribution and training headquarters in Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Denmark and Spain. The foundation was the Meidl Airport in Fertőszentmiklós, Hungary, where he also established a flight training school.Siebenhofer establishes flight school in 2005 Other manufacturers committed Siebenhofer as a test pilot.Maiden flight of an ArrowCopter , Siebenhofers Report from ArrowCopters maiden flight. Today – since 2009 – he is the owner of “The 7 Group LTD”, Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan. In this year, he will receive the assignment to establish the first training headquarters for Kurdish pilots in Iraq, from Kurdistan Regional Government in Erbil, Iraq, in cooperation with the US Army. Gyrocopters, as well as (as of 2011) helicopters, will be deployed. 2010 and 2011, further gyrocopters will be delivered to the Kurdish interior ministry and pilots will be trained. To prevent terroristic encroachments, the interior ministry will monitor the approach- and take off paths of the airports in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. Beginning in 2011, Siebenhofers company delivered helicopters of the type Eurocopter EC 120B for the traffic police in Iraqi Kurdistan. Just as with the gyrocopters, he will train the pilots as well as the ground crew. 14 January 2014 was a historic day in Kurdish history: For the first time ever, a Kurdish-only crew flew a helicopter (EC 120B) over Erbil. The crew were Brigadier Khalid Ali Barzinji and First Lieutenant Sarhang Barwari, both trained by The 7 Group. During the advancement of the Islamic State towards Kurdistan, Siebenhofer did not leave Kurdistan, although he knows he is a target of IS.Er fliegt der Gefahr nicht einfach davon - Kleine Zeitung, 28 September 2014 He is still involved in training and coordinating the missions of the Kurdish police.Zagros TV with Andi Siebenhofer (CEO) The 7 Group, Kurdistan Iraq, 21 October 2014 In August 2013 7 Group LTD deployed two Eurocopter EC135 helicopters to Kurdistan for the Kurdistan CTU (counter terrorism unit). 7 Group LTD has re-equipped the helicopters. One (S/N 661) was prior owned by Roman Abramovich and the other one (S/N 681) was originally ordered by the Spanish police, but due to the financial crisis the Spanish government has to step back from the order. So The 7 Group took over the brand new helicopter from Airbus Helicopters, at this time still called Eurocopter. During the run of the so-called Islamic state towards the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, Erbil, the 7 Group assisted the Peshmerga. Although the helicopters so far on duty by the Kurdish Police are not equipped for Medevac missions, Siebenhofer personally and his company, The Kurdish Aviation Team, did their utmost and risk their lives when flying to the front line for evacuation of wounded Peshmerga fighters. On these missions, the helicopters were fired at twice and on one occasion a pilot was wounded in his leg. Fortunately and due to the excellent training provided, no total loss was recorded. In addition, an EMS squad was established in Dohuk.Police Helicopter Team Dohuk EMS Service for Kurdistan In June 2014 Andi Siebenhofer was awarded a contract by the Counter-Terrorism and Security unit of the Province Sulaymaniyah to establish a new aviation department. Since then, this department was continuously expanded. As of June 2016, 16 pilots and 8 aviation technicians were trained. During this time four gyroplanes (type Autogyro MTO Sport) where deployed to be used as a basic training equipment. At the same time three Airbus Helicopters AS350B3+ (new designation: H125; S/N 4636, 4743 and 8063) as well as one Cessna Caravan EX (S/N 5043) were delivered to add up to the fleet of the Ministry of Interiors. While the EC135 are stationed in Erbil, the AS350 operate out of Sulaymaniyah. In July 2016, Andi Siebenhofer met the Federal Minister for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs of Austria, Sebastian Kurz, in Erbil. On July 17, 2016, Andi Siebenhofer and his company 7 Group LTD were awarded by minister Karim Sinjary a new contract for the provision of services, maintenance and training of the complete aviation fleet of the Kurdish Ministry of Interiors. At this time, the fleet comprises 39 aircraft: 2 MD902, 2 EC135, 4 EC120B, 3 AS350B3, 12 MD530, 1 MD500, 1 Cessna Caravan EX, 12 AutoGyro MTO Sport and 2 AutoGyro Calidus.

They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies. During battle sequences, the game uses the Style Shift Linear Motion Battle System. Four characters are chosen to battle and characters not controlled by a player are controlled by artificial intelligence with instructions set by the players beforehand. The \\"Chain Capacity\\" (CC) denotes the number of skills and actions a character can perform. Usage brings the CC down and is recharged over time. During battle, the player and enemy has an \\"Eleth Gauge\\". When the Eleth Gauge is filled, the user or the enemy receive unlimited CC and become resistant to stunning. Each character has two skill systems: \\"Assault Artes\\" which are pre-determined combos and \\"Burst Artes\\" which can be mapped to specific inputs. Skill and attribute development are dependent on \\"Titles\\" and their levels. Titles are earned through story progression and completion of miscellaneous criteria during battle. Each Title has five levels which are advanced by completing battles. Plot The game takes place in a fictional world called Ephinea. Ephinea is divided into three countries: Windor, Strahta, and Fendel. Asbel Lhant, Hubert Lhant, and Cheria Barnes are children from Lhant, a village of Windor. One day, the three befriend an amnesiac girl from outside their village who they name Sophie.Library Synopsis (Named after a Flower): \\"When Asbel and Hubert returned to Lhant with the girl, they found their longtime friend Cheria waiting [...] Asbel named the mysterious girl Sophie\\" That same day, Lhant is visited by Richard, the prince of Windor, who befriends the four of them. Richard returns to Barona, Windor's capital city, and invites them to sneak into his castle via a secret passage.Library Synopsis (The Gathering Storm): \\"Richard proposed a late-night tour of the castle using a secret underground passageway. Asbel readily accepted, but Richard failed to appear at the time and place he had promised.\\" There, the four are mortally wounded by an unknown monster but are saved when Sophie sacrifices herself. Asbel regains consciousness in Lhant and is told about Sophie's death and Hubert's political adoption into the Oswell family to secure Asbel's future as the Lord of Lhant. Daunted over Sophie's death and the political events at home, Asbel runs away from home and enrolls in the Barona knight academy.Library Synopsis (Childhood's End): \\"The party found the secret entrance to the catacombs, and discovered Richard lying motionless within. Just then, a mysterious monster attacked, gravely wounding everyone. An enraged Sophie managed to bring the creature down, but was run through by its claws. Then, there was a flood of light, and Asbel awoke to learn that Sophie had died and Hubert had been fostered to another family. Asbel and Aston fought, and even Cheria couldn't calm him down. Determined to run away, Asbel showed up at the gates of the Knight Academy.\\" Seven years later, Asbel learns from Cheria that his father died defending Lhant from an invasion by Fendel.Library Synopsis (The Envoy from Lhant): \\"Asbel returned to Barona to find Cheria waiting. Asbel was stunned by her news: the conflict between Lhant and Fendel was intensifying, his father had been killed in battle, and his mother had grown ill with worry. With Malik's encouragement, Asbel decided to return to Lhant with Cheria.\\" The two return to Lhant and are saved from Fendel's army by Sophie and later Hubert with the Stratha military. Hubert reveals Stratha has been ordered by Windor to secure Lhant and assumes the position of Lord after banishing Asbel from the village.Library Synopsis (Exiled from Lhant): \\"Hubert explained that Windor and Strahta had forged an alliance, and that he would take responsibility for Lhant's governance. Outmaneuvered by his own brother, Asbel was banished from Lhant. Hearing rumors of Richard's death, the party investigate and find him in the castle's secret passage. Richard explains his father was killed by his uncle, Cedric, who then assumed the throne.Library Synopsis (Friends Reunited): \\"Shaken by a report of Richard's death from one of his pursuers, Asbel sought to verify it by traveling through the secret passage that starts at the Royal Sanctuary. Inside the catacombs he found Richard himself, wounded but alive. [...] The party decided to temporarily retreat from the capital and turn to Duke Dalen of Gralesyde for help. The three travel to meet a trusted Duke and are joined by Pascal, a prodigy from an engineering tribe known as the Amarcians.Library Synopsis (A Spirited Companion): \\"On the road from the catacombs to Wallbridge, a girl named Pascal joined the group after claiming to have seen an illusion of Sophie.\\" With the Duke's army, the party overthrows Cedric and Richard regains the throne.Library Synopsis (Crowning the New King): \\"Determined to settle things personally, Richard joined Asbel in defeating Archduke Cedric. Once again, Richard's hatred drove him into a display of wanton cruelty. Even his appearance changed, further raising Asbel's misgivings. Nevertheless, peasants and nobles alike rejoiced at their new king, and marked the occasion with a magnificent coronation.\\" Richard orders an invasion of Lhant to rid it of Stratha's control, forcing the party to betray him.Library Synopsis (A Seven- Year Reunion): \\"Without waiting to hear the results of Asbel's negotiations, Richard launched a surprise invasion of Lhant. Richard declared that those who defied him must be shown no mercy, and when Asbel forcefully disagreed, the furious king declared him a traitor. Having reclaimed her memories from seven years earlier, Sophie was able to block Richard's attack, and after a ferocious struggle, Richard and his army withdrew.\\" Acknowledging Hubert's efforts as Lord of Lhant, Asbel and the party, joined by Malik Caesar, travel to Stratha to negotiate with the government to formally instate Hubert as Lord. The government agrees on the pretense that Pascal fixes Stratha's valkines, a large crystal which supplies a life sustaining energy known as eleth; Pascal succeeds but Richard appears and absorbs the valkines' eleth, and flees.Library Synopsis (Quid Pro Duo): \\"Learning that Strahta's occupation of Lhant was due to problems with Strahta's own cryas, and that overturning the recall order would be dependent on solving that, Asbel offered to have Pascal fix Strahta's valkines. Pascal succeeded, but Richard appeared on the scene and sucked all of the power from the valkines into himself.\\" The party learn Windor's valkines has also been absorbed and plan to intercept Richard at the final valkines in Fendel.Library Synopsis (Together Again): \\"The party was stunned when they heard the news that Hubert had traveled to Strahta to deliver: Richard had also absorbed the eleth from Windor's own valkines. Everyone agreed that Richard was most likely on his way to the last remaining valkines. [...] From there, they planned to infiltrate Fendel, the nation that held the final valkines.\\" Hubert joins the party as they travel to Fendel but fail to stop Richard. Deducing the Lastalia, the planet's core, is Richard's target, the party find Richard there; Richard mortally injures Sophie before sealing the entrance to the Lastalia.Library Synopsis (The Lastalia): \\"Asbel and his party traveled to World's Eye, an island connected to the core of the planet, in order to protect the Lastalia. When Richard appeared there, he no longer seemed to be human at all. At one point, Richard seemed to briefly regain consciousness, but when Sophie proposed another friendship pact, Richard critically wounded Sophie and triggered a powerful chain reaction.\\" The party is unable to heal Sophie with magic or medicine, so Pascal suggests the party travel to Fodra, a nearby planet that Sophie originates from, to find a cure.Library Synopsis (For Sophie): \\"Richard's attack blinded Sophie, and even the strongest of medicines could not cure her condition. This, combined with the fact that Richard had called her Protos Heis, led Pascal to conclude that Sophie might not actually be human. If that were the case, Pascal figured they may be able to save her by going to the Fodra place mentioned in the Archive of Wisdom.\\" After finding a space shuttle left by Pascal's ancestors, the party travel to Fodra where they meet Emeraude, the last remaining human on the desolated planet.Library Synopsis (Fodra, the Other World): \\"Having finally reached Fodra, the party discovered a city where a woman named Emeraude had been asleep for 1,000 years. There they learned that Sophie was an artificial humanoid soldier, and that they would need to go to a special facility to repair her.\\" Using advanced machinery, Sophie is healed and regains her memories, revealing she is a biological humanoid engineered to defeat Lambda, the monster that attacked them in their childhood and is currently possessing Richard.Library Synopsis (Welcome Back, Sophie): \\"Asbel's party learned that Richard was infected by a life form known as Lambda, and that Sophie was a humanoid that had been created to destroy it.\\" Emeraude helps the party bypass the barrier on the Lastalia where they confront and defeat Richard. Emeraude betrays the party and attempts to absorb Lambda's power but dies in the process.Library Synopsis (The Wages of Ambition): \\"The shuttle landed within the cocoon that Richard had created. Sophie was determined to destroy Richard when she encountered him; Emeraude had given her the power to sacrifice herself in order to eradicate Lambda, and she had planned to use it. But Emeraude stopped her in hopes of instead using Lambda's power to restore life to Fodra. Lambda rejected her and, once again, left for the Lastalia with Richard.\\" Lambda begins to fuse with the Lastalia, causing the party to see his memories and learn about his suffering caused by humanity.Library Synopsis (The Story of Lambda): \\"In the Lastalia, glimpses of Lambda's memories revealed his tragic past. As a new life form, he was made into a test subject on Fodra, and was marked for termination when his natural abilities were deemed too dangerous. Cornell, who treated Lambda like a person and even made him smile, ultimately sacrificed his own life to save Lambda. That experience instilled within Lambda a fierce will to survive, and an empathy for the young Richard he would later find teetering at the brink of death.\\" The party defeats the materialized Lambda; since Lambda can not be killed by normal means, Sophie intends to sacrifice herself to kill him. Instead, Asbel absorbs and convinces Lambda to let him show humanity's worth. Lambda agrees before falling into a deep sleep.Library Synopsis (The Battle's End): \\"Asbel allowed Lambda into himself to see his true intentions. Witnessing the strength of Asbel's resolve, Lambda decided to remain within Asbel, and fell into a deep sleep. And thus, peace returned to the world. Asbel and his companions each returned to the places where they belonged, to fulfill their individual destinies.\\" In the after-story Lineage and Legacies, the monster population has become an epidemic, forcing Asbel and his friends to reunite and investigate the cause.Library Synopsis (Barona, Six Months Later): \\"Upon arriving in Barona, Asbel reunited with Richard, Cheria, Malik, and Hubert. [...] Hubert and Malik confirmed that the increase in monster attacks was not confined to Windor.\\" Hypothesizing that the eleth from Fodra is influencing the monsters, the party travel there and discover Fodra's core has reactivated. They learn the core is sentient and wants revenge on the humans for Fodra's environmental decay. The party defeats Fodra's soldiers, the Little Queens, and have the reawakened Lambda absorb Fodra's consciousness. In doing so, Lambda returns to his deep sleep in order to dissuade Fodra's hatred. The party separates and returns to their daily life, concluding with Asbel proposing to Cheria.

Sophie is revealed to be Protos Heis, a humanoid made of tiny particles acting in concert with each other. Her death seven years ago is explained as Sophie breaking up into particles residing inside Asbel, Hubert, and Cheria to heal their wounds and is the reason the three possess mystical powers.Emeraude: \\"Protos Heis is composed of individual particles that act in concert with each other. These particles, tinier than a grain of sand, come together to form a human shape. And while they act as one, the particles also possess the ability to separate from each other, which is what you see happening now. [...] It's the result of a process called \\"distriputive preservation\\". Your friends must be completely synchronized with Protos Heis' particles. [...] When Protos Heis suffers heavy damage, it usually splits into individual particles, shuts down all functionality, and begins the process of reconstruction. This is known as \\"particle preservation\\". Distributive preservation, on the other hand, allows Protos Heis to implant its particles into one or more separate vessels. [...]\\" Pascal: \\"Would her particles have any kind of effect on the vessels that they went into?\\" /Emeraude:\\"Yes. In fact, while the particles prepare for reconstruction, they would repair any damaged areas of the vessels as well.\\" /Pascal: \\"So Sophie split herself into three parts and then used those parts to save Asbel, Cheria, and Little Bro! [...]\\" /Hubert: \\"I see.

[...] Asbel... Cheria... Hubert... Richard... Pascal... Captain Malik... You're all going to die someday...But not me. If I were a human you couldn't leave me alone when you die. Help me, Asbel. How do I become human? [...] No matter how sad I get, I can't even cry like you.\\" To lessen her fears, Asbel formally adopts her into the Lhant family.Asbel: \\"I've given this some thought, and if you want a family, I think we should give you one.

I've sacrificed everything to achieve what I've become. I'm not you. I didn't forget my home and my people so I could go gallivanting around the countryside.\\"Hubert: \\"Because of pride. You miss them at first but in time that pain turns to anger. Soon, you feel as if you can never forgive them. [...] You hate him. You want to get back at him. You want to ask why he did it. [...] But that only lasts as long as he's still around.

He was awarded Soviet Land Nehru Prize in 1978; and was the recipient of Vidyasagar Award (1992) and Nazrul Award (2000) from the Government of West Bengal and Advaita Mallavarmana Award from the Government of Tripura (2002), Maulana Azad Award by the Muslim Cultural Association and Muzaffar Ahmed Smriti Puraskar. He was awarded Padma Bhushan in 1990 and Padma Vibhushan in 1991 by the President of India for his lifelong services. He was a writer of numerous articles in both English and Bengali over seven decades; author of nearly 50 published books. Hiren Mukerjee was a writer in two languages, English and Bengali, and commanded a distinctive and inimitable style in both. Despite the profundity of style and content he could introduce a charming lightheartedness and exuberance, his vocabulary ranging from the classical to the colloquial, and his references being wide, eclectic and polymathic. He was also an active epistoler, and replied to every correspondent, always writing in his own hand till his last days. Less known perhaps was his amazing command of Sanskrit, from which he quoted aptly and abundantly in his speeches and writings if the occasion demanded, his phenomenal memory coming to his aid. Some of his published books are – An Introduction to Socialism, Under Marx's Banner, Marx, Great October, India and the Future, Credo: Some Socialist Affirmations, India and Parliament, India's Struggle for Freedom, Studies of Rabindranath Tagore, Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose and Swami Vivekananda. Voluminous writings in Bengali include an impressive and significant book of reminiscences, Tari Hote Teer (\\"From the Boat to the Shore\\") and collection of selected articles in two volumes. Notwithstanding his shining qualities and often fiery eloquence, in personal demeanour Hiren Mukerjee was a quiet and unassuming personality, even to the point of shyness. He died in Kolkata on 30 July 2004 at the age of 96. Hailed as the Communist Rishi (ref. Sri Gopal Gandhi's obituary in The Hindu dated 1 August 2004), Hirendra Nath Mukerjee left lasting impression on our national life. Appropriately, the Parliament of India instituted the \\"Professor Hiren Mukerjee Memorial Parliamentary Lecture\\" from 2008 (Hiren Mukerjee's birth centenary year). The lecture was the first of its kind in the history of Indian Parliament and indeed a tribute to one of the greatest parliamentarians India has produced. Held in the Central Hall of Parliament, the first four Memorial Lectures were delivered by Nobel-Laureate Professor Amartya Sen (2008), Nobel Laureate economist/banker Md Yunus (2009), eminent economist Prof. Jagdish Bhagwati (2010) and the Prime Minister of Bhutan, H. E. Lyonchen Jigmi Y. Thinley (2012). The Lok Sabha Secretariat also produced a publication entitled \\"Hiren Mukerjee in Parliament\\" compiling some of his important speeches in the Lok Sabha spanning 25 years.

Palin had never been to Brazil which, in the 21st century, has become a global player with a booming economy bringing massive social changes to this once-sleeping giant which, as the fifth largest country, is as big as some continents.Brazil with Michael Palin BBC One, 2012; Retrieved 25 October 2012 The series should not be confused with the 1985 Terry Gilliam film Brazil, which starred Michael Palin. Episode one: Out of Africa Palin begins his journey in the northeast, where modern Brazil was born. It was here the Portuguese explorers first landed and encountered the native Brazilians and where hundreds of thousands of African slaves, more than to the United States and Caribbean, were brought to work on sugar and tobacco plantations. The northeast was where this mix of races and cultures produced what we now think of as Brazil. Music, food, dance and religion all bear the imprint of this mix. Palin visits the city of São Luís during the celebration of its own very northeastern festival of Bumba Meu Boi (\\"Jump My Bull\\") before travelling down the coast to Recife and Salvador. On his way, he drops in on the vaqueiros, Brazilian cowboys, who work the massive cattle ranches of the caatinga. His travels also take him to the stunning coastal lagoons of the Lençóis Maranhenses National Park. In Salvador, Palin learns to drum with the famous Olodum school, experiences the trance and dance of Candomblé, the Afro-Brazilian religion, finds out how to cook Bahian-style and discovers what lies behind the beguiling moves of capoeira dancers. * UK viewing figures: 5.74 million Episode two: Into Amazonia Palin continues his first visit to Brazil by travelling by river and plane from the northern border with Venezuela to the capital of Brasília. Along the way he visits the indigenous tribe Yanomami, accessible only by air, learning about the threat to their hunter-gatherer way of life. He moves on to the city of Manaus, population two million, watching a rehearsal by the Amazon Philharmonic Orchestra in the Manaus Opera House and then taking two ferries on the fourteen-hour journey to the remains of Henry Ford's unsuccessful attempt to build a vast rubber plantation at Fordlândia in the middle of the rainforest. In Belém music producer Priscilla explains why Amazonian women are such a powerful force in the country. Palin moves southwards travelling to the upper reaches of the Xingu River; he is welcomed to the Wauja tribe, one of the most colourful of all the Brazilian indigenous peoples. Anthropologist Emi Ireland helps explain their rich and complex rituals and the threats to their land and way of life from dam building, deemed necessary for the increasing exploitation of Brazil's abundant natural resources. In Brasília, constructed in only five years, he meets rock star and political activist Dinho Ouro Preto, who believes that, despite its social and environmental problems, the country is on the brink of becoming a superpower. * UK viewing figures: Episode three: The Road to Rio Palin starts this leg of the journey in the mineral-rich state of Minas Gerais which as the sugar plantations of the north declined provided the new wealth of the country. He visits an old gold mine once owned by the British, before going to see a vast opencast iron ore mine that is fuelling Brazil's economic miracle. He also visits the state capital Belo Horizonte, Brazil's sixth largest city. From Minas Palin goes down to Rio de Janeiro, population six and half million and capital for 125 years, host to the next 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. Rio has always had a reputation as a party town but also has suffered from terrible violence, with heavily armed drug gangs controlling the notorious shanty towns or favelas that make up a large part of the city. The authorities have decided to spend some of Brazil's new money on healing the rift between the favelas and the rest of the city. The policy of \\"pacification\\" aims to drive the drug gangs out and fund new infrastructure, such as cable cars, and social programmes to make the favelas truly part of the city. Palin visits the BOPE (Special Operations Battalion) used to combat what was (according to what is said in the show) some of the most violent places on Earth and to see how lives have been transformed by pacification. Palin also finds time to visit some of Rio's best-known locations, learns how to celebrate a goal like a Brazilian radio commentator, and books a room in one of the city's infamous \\"love hotels\\". *UK viewing figures: 4.20 million Episode four: The Deep South Palin finds many surprises as he encounters the rich diversity of the more European and Asian cultures that have created a new melting pot in the deep south of Brazil. In the town of Paraty he meets up with Prince João de Bragança (heir to the defunct throne of Brazil when the Portuguese court fled from Napoleon's occupation), who did much to establish the institutions that have enabled Brazil's economy to flourish. Palin visits Embraer, one of the recent high- tech success stories and now the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer. He takes part in the handover of a jet to the Dutch air carrier KLM. Palin next moves to the largest city in the southern hemisphere, São Paulo, which is the helicopter capital of the world with over 400 helicopters avoiding the massive traffic jams below. He visits the studios of Brazil's popular soap operas that not rarely last more than eight months. He visits Japanese residents who comprise 1.5 million of the population, with their own newspaper. Palin is then taken to the home of rap star, philosopher and poet Criolo in the slums of São Paulo, who thinks the notion of social equality is a distant dream for most Brazilians. This view is countered by a visit to ex- president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who gives a more optimistic vision. Travelling south to Blumenau and Pomerode, Palin finds German speakers stubbornly sticking to their German roots in their buildings and customs. In the vast wetlands of the Pantanal Palin catches a piranha, which is instantly turned into sashimi by his guide. He helps the cowboys treat a calf attacked by a jaguar, and sees the diversity of the wildlife. Palin's journey ends at the Iguazu Falls, where he concludes that Brazil has much to offer the world as it takes its place as a new superpower. * UK viewing figures: 3.53 millionGabriel Byrne's 'Secret State' sheds viewers on Channel 4 Digital Spy, 15 November 2012; Retrieved 28 November 2012 Book Brazil, a book to accompany the series, was published on 11 October 2012.

Sandford was the third son of Henry Sandford by the Honourable Sarah Moore, daughter of The 1st Viscount Mountcashell. He was returned to the Irish House of Commons for both Carrick and Roscommon Borough in 1783, but chose to sit for the latter. He continued to represent this constituency until 1797 and again between 1798 and 1799. In 1800 his elder brother Henry was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Mount Sandford, with a special remainder to his younger brothers William and George. George's nephew Henry succeeded to the barony in 1814 but was killed at a brawl at Windsor on his way to the Ascot races in 1828, when the title devolved on George. As this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords and he was never elected an Irish Representative Peer. Lord Mount Sandford died in September 1846, aged 90, when the barony became extinct.

Kurumchi culture extended in Eastern Siberia Lake Baikal area, and in the upper course of Lena and Angara rivers. The monuments of the culture include encampments, settlements, burials, petroglyphs, and inscriptions. Prominent monuments are cemeteries on Lake Baikal Olkhon Island with gravestone structures in a form of miniatures of wigwam type, rock images painted with red ocher in the upper course of the river Lena (Shishkin, and others) and on the river Kuda, depicting horsemen with banners, camels, men in long robes and other images. The petroglyph images have much in common with the art of the Altai Enisei Kirgizes and Altai Turks of the 1st millennium CE. Kurykan wrote their inscriptions in the Orkhon-Yenisei script. According to the Chinese sources, the Kurykan tribal Union was headed by two chieftains. Kurykans are traced to their ancestral Slab Grave Culture of 1,100-300 BCE. Kurumchi culture influenced the culture of the Sakha and Buryat Mongols, and Kurykans were among their ancestors. History Kurykans were largely displaced from their ancestor territories in the 6th century CE. According to the inscription of the Bilge Kagan, Uch- Kurykans (Union of Three Kurykan tribes, Guligan of the Chinese chronicles) sent their ambassadors to the Bumyn Kagan funeral in 552 and/or his brother Istemi Kagan in 576. Kurykans are listed among the enemies of Ilterish Kagan (r. 682–694), father of Bilge Kagan (r. 717–734). Ilterish Kagan campaigned against Uch-Kurykans 47 times, and gave 20 battles. At the funeral of Kul Tigin in 731 Uch-Kurykans are not mentioned. It is thought that the Kurykan- Turkic war resulted in the remaining Kurykans fleeing north-west to their present territories in the Sakha Republic. Genetic analysis of the Sakha population shows a bottleneck dated approximately at that time, 1300 ± 200 ybp.

He was the first Qi ruler from the House of Tian, replacing the House of Jiang that had ruled the state for over six centuries. Duke Tai's personal name was Tian He (田和), and ancestral name Gui (媯). His official posthumous title was simply Duke Tai of Qi, but he is commonly called Duke Tai of Tian Qi or Duke Tai of Tian to be distinguished from Jiang Ziya, the original Duke Tai from the House of Jiang, who founded Qi in the 11th century BC. Reign Since Tian He's great-grandfather Tian Heng killed Duke Jian of Qi in 481 BC, the leaders of the Tian clan had been the de facto rulers of Qi. In 404 BC Tian He succeeded his older brother Tian Daozi as head of the Tian clan. He nominally served under Duke Kang of Qi, the last ruler from the House of Jiang, but effectively ruled the state himself. Tian He asked Marquis Wu of Wei to lobby for him at the court of King An of Zhou, the nominal ruler of all China. In 386 BC, King An officially recognized Tian He as ruler of Qi, ending more than six centuries of rule by the House of Jiang. Tian He became the first de jure ruler of Qi from the House of Tian, and is posthumously known as Duke Tai of Qi. He subsequently exiled Duke Kang to a seaside city, where Duke Kang lived for seven more years and died in 379 BC. Duke Tai died in 384 BC, just two years after formally ascending the throne. He was succeeded by his son Tian Yan, who would later be killed by Duke Tai's younger son Tian Wu, Duke Huan of Tian Qi.

He was born to an Italian father, Fausto Piscionieri, an interior designer and architect practising in India in the early 1930s, and a Parsee (Zoroastrian) mother, Kathleen \\"Kitty\\" Vicajee. His mother's family, the Vicajees, are one of the oldest Zoroastrian Parsee families, who were closely attached as bankers to Nizam of Hyderabad, one of the wealthiest Muslim rulers of India. A silver coin, the \\"Pestonshahi Sikka\\", was minted in India in 1840 for the first and only time, in honour of the Pestonjee Meherjee brothers, for the Vicajee family. Biography When Jack Bertoli was a child his mother divorced his father and went to live with her sister, Thelma \\"Vicajee\\" Tata, and her husband J.R.D. Tata, a prominent industrialist, visionary, philanthropist, and planner who obtained a Bharat Ratna, the highest civil award in India. Kitty became a voluntary nurse during the second World War for the wounded army and navy men, and later remarried an Italian Naval Officer, Giovanni Bertoli, one of the first pilots in the Italian Navy before Aircraft carriers, with catapulted planes. He was shot down by the RAF in the African Campaign near Tripoly in 1942, taken prisoner, and put in charge of the Italian Prisoner of War Camps in India. His knowledge and enthusiasm for aircraft led to a close friendship with J.R.D. Tata, who was the first Indian ever to obtain a flying licence, Indian Licence Number 1., on 10 February 1929. In 1930, he participated in the Aga Khan Prize to be the first Indian to attempt to fly solo from England to India. In 1932, he flew the first air link for the Indian Airmail service from Karachi to Bombay in a DeHavilland Gypsy-Moth, and established Tata Airlines, which later became Air- India. After the war, Giovanni Bertoli retired from the Italian Navy with the rank of Rear-Admiral and joined Air-India as the District Manager for Continental Europe, based in Geneva, Switzerland. On 24 January 1966, while returning from Mumbai with his friend Dr. Homi Bhabha, a physicist, and Director of the Atomic Energy Establishment of India, their Air-India Boeing 707 plane crashed into Mont Blanc only a few minutes before landing in Geneva, killing all 117 passengers and crew. Personal and family life While living with Thelly and Jeh, before the Partition of the Country, and after the Independence of India, Jack Bertoli had the chance to meet with many Indian, and world political leaders and world dignitaries, who were often invited to the J.R.D. Tata's private receptions, held in their house in Bombay, called \\"The Cairn\\". Among these were Jawaharial Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi, who was a close friend of Bertoli's mother; Krishna Hutheesing (Nerhu's sister), V.K. Khrishna Menon, described as the second most powerful man in India; Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of the Muslim State of Pakistan (East and West Pakistan), Willy Messerschmitt, the designer of the World War II German fighter plane, and the three wheeler K200 small, inexpensive car; and also several ambassadors and world political leaders. Jack Bertoli, on his birthday, was introduced to Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi), the \\"Father of the Indian Nation\\", who had celebrated his birthday two days earlier. Gandhi was living next to J.R.D. Tata's holiday home on the Beach of Juhu, near Bombay, and was on a fasting and non-speaking period of Civic Disobedience in his non-violent fight for the Independence of the Country. He wrote a short poem for Jack Bertoli, urging him to try and follow the best road of life, in the simplest yet most dynamic way. This meeting with Gandhi, together with the personal teachings and philosophy he received from J.R.D. Tata, encouraged Jack Bertoli to pursue planning for the betterment of life for the less fortunate masses and population of India. Education and schooling Jack Bertoli was taught by Spanish Jesuit priests in India, in St. Mary's High School, and the Campion School, in Bombay, and later at the International School of Geneva, Switzerland. His step-father, Giovanni Bertoli, contacted the Dean of the University of Geneva, and enrolled him in the university to study architecture, without his school certificate. Jack Bertoli obtained his diploma, a Masters in Architecture, from the University of Geneva in the shortest time ever, a record that still stands today. He studied under the guidance of Eugene Beaudouin, a French \\"Grand Prix de Rome\\" architect who designed and built the Tour Montparnasse in Paris. Bertoli, with several fellowships offered to him from the United States, attended Princeton University, USA, where he obtained a second Masters of Fine Arts in Planning, and was later offered an Instructorship in Architecture by Princeton University. At Princeton he studied and worked with several professors and visiting professors, including Robert W. MaLaughiln, Jean Labtut, and Enrico Perussitti, the designer of the Torre Velasca in Milan, and partner of the Italian Architectural Group BBPR; Buckminster Fuller, known for his Geodisic Domes, Louis Kahn, and Paul Lester Wiener, an architect and urban planner, who was a collaborator of Le Corbusier on the team to undertake the Master Plan of Bogota and Brasilia. After his studies in the US, Jack Bertoli obtained several job offers and worked for assignments on international projects for Marcel Breuer and Eero Saarinen, as well as joining the team of R.B. O'Connor and W.H. Kilham Jr. to design the new American Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. Architectural practice=India In 1960, Jack Bertoli returned to India from the US, to join the Ford Foundation in New Delhi as a consultant for the development of the Delhi Master Plan. He undertook planning and research and a study with the architect Le Corbusier in Chandigarh, who was designing the new city capital of the Punjab. His research, work, and designs were oriented towards the planning for the improvement of the habitat for the masses, particularly in the urban and rural population, with possibilities to better the urban slum population of India. His designs incorporated methods of construction for economic housing for the poor, that would use simple but lasting cheap materials, such as pre-stressed bamboo beams, straw and mud constructions. Inhabitants would be provided with self-help classes teaching how to build and plan their own houses as optimum units in economic groups, that could be easily expanded upon and enlarged as families increased in size. Several of these buildings were built, and details were published in Indian newspapers and magazines. Jack Bertoli continued his research and studies towards the practical design of grouped-housing-units for the poor, for optimum economical structures with different Indian village concept layout schemes. This included the protection of nature, the protection of the site with the best orientation for energy-efficiency, and the best choice of local materials. Respect for the local culture, tradition, the different religions, and habits of the villagers would be prioritised. Special design features would give and include for all the inhabitants in these planned areas, important and essential interior elements for a better standard of living. Every home unit would have the necessary basics with all the essential elements for better living conditions, e.g. interior-privacy, light interior partitions, cooking-corners, a running-water tap, individual lavatories with a washing space, used-water evacuation, and a small private-patio garden. Jack Bertoli obtained the mandate to design the New Township of Trombay for the Indian Atomic Energy Establishment. Technical problems concerning this project held it up indefinitely, although Bertoli was offered several large private mandates from important Indian promoters and contractors. However, with the continued requests to be introduced to J.R.D. Tata, Bertoli realised that corruption and nepotism were thriving in the country, and that architectural mandates were being handed out, not in the interests of the project, but with specific interests and requests only to be introduced to J.R.D. Tata. Jack Bertoli subsequently returned to Geneva, with the proposition from Switzerland to become a Swiss citizen, and open his private practice, with a return air ticket to India that he kept as a souvenir. International projects Jack Bertoli opened an office in Geneva, that incorporated twenty-one architects and a design staff. Some of his projects and designs were built in India, Switzerland, France, Italy, Africa, the United States of America, and the Caribbean, and can be seen on his website.Official Jack Bertoli website. Present projects Jack Bertoli's present work revisits his earlier research for proposals and solutions for the housing of the growing population problem of India. His work involves plans to establish a strong future philosophy for the planning of construction in India, together with the participation of Indian planners, politicians, and industrialists, including a few of the New Indian multibillionaires.

It implies that the number of points in a fixed region will follow a Poisson distribution.  Statement  Let there exist a chance process realized by a set of points (called hits) over a bounded region K \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2 such that: :1) There are only a finite number of hits over the entire region K. :2) There are no multiple hits at a single point. :3) There is homogeneity and independence among the hits. i.e. For any non- overlapping subregions B_1,\\\\ldots, B_k \\\\in K, k \\\\ge 2, the numbers of hits in these regions are independent. In any region B, let NB be the number of hits in B. Then there exists a positive constant \\\\lambda such that for each subregion B \\\\in K, NB has a Poisson distribution with parameter \\\\lambda B, where B is the area of B (remember that this is \\\\mathbb{R}^2, in other measure spaces, B could mean different things, i.e. length in \\\\mathbb{R}). In addition, for any non-overlapping regions B_1,\\\\ldots,B_k, the random variables N_{B_1},\\\\ldots,N_{B_k} are independent from one another. The positive constant \\\\lambda is called the intensity parameter, and is equivalent to the number of hits in a unit area of K. : _Proof_ : E(N_B)/ B = \\\\lambdaB/B = \\\\lambda Also, : P ( \\\\text{ one hit in B } ) = \\\\lambda B e ^ {-\\\\lambdaB} \\\\rightarrow \\\\lambda B \\\\text { as } B \\\\rightarrow 0 While the statement of the theorem here is limited to \\\\mathbb{R}^2, the theorem can be generalized to any-dimensional space. Some calculations change depending on the space that the points are scattered in (as is mentioned above), but the general assumptions and outcomes still hold.  Example  Consider raindrops falling on a rooftop. The rooftop is the region K \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^2, while the raindrops can be considered the hits of our system. It is reasonable to assume that the number of raindrops that fall in any particular region of the rooftop follows a poisson distribution. The Poisson Scatter Theorem, states that if one was to subdivide the rooftops into k disjoint sub-regions, then the number of raindrops that hits a particular region B_i with intensity \\\\lambda_i of the rooftop is independent from the number of raindrops that hit any other subregion. Suppose that 2000 raindrops fall in 1000 subregions of the rooftop, randomly. The expected number of raindrops per subregion would be 2\\\\. So the distribution of the number of raindrops on the whole rooftop is Poisson with intensity parameter 2\\\\. The distribution of the number of raindrops falling on 1/5 of the rooftop is Poisson with intensity parameter 2/5. Due to the reproductive property of the Poisson distribution, k independent random scatters on the same region can superimpose to produce a random scatter that follows a poisson distribution with parameter (\\\\lambda_1+\\\\lambda_2+\\\\cdots+\\\\lambda_k).

As reported, it is one of the first known uses of offensive cyber weapons. Started under the administration of George W. Bush in 2006, Olympic Games was accelerated under President Obama, who heeded Bush's advice to continue cyber attacks on the Iranian nuclear facility at Natanz. Bush believed that the strategy was the only way to prevent an Israeli conventional strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. President Barack Obama \\"secretly ordered increasingly sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities, significantly expanding America's first sustained use of cyber weapons\\" History During Bush's second term, General James Cartwright, then head of United States Strategic Command, along with other intelligence officials presented Bush with sophisticated code that would act as an offensive cyber weapon. \\"The goal was to gain access to the Natanz plant's industrial computer controls ... the computer code would invade the specialized computers that command the centrifuges.\\" Collaboration happened with Israel's SIGINT intelligence service, Unit 8200. Israel's involvement was important to the United States because the former had \\"deep intelligence about operations at Natanz that would be vital to making the cyber attack a success.\\" Additionally, American officials wanted to \\"dissuade the Israelis from carrying out their own preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities.\\" To prevent a conventional strike, Israel had to be deeply involved in Operation Olympic Games. The computer virus created by the two countries became known as \\"the bug,\\" and Stuxnet by the IT community once it became public. The malicious software temporarily halted approximately 1,000 of the 5,000 centrifuges from spinning at Natanz. A programming error in \\"the bug\\" caused it to spread to computers outside of Natanz. When an engineer \\"left Natanz and connected [his] computer to the Internet, the American- and Israeli-made bug failed to recognize that its environment had changed.\\" The code replicated on the Internet and was subsequently exposed for public dissemination. IT security firms Symantec and Kaspersky Lab have since examined Stuxnet. It is unclear whether the United States or Israel introduced the programming error. Significance According to the Atlantic Monthly, Operation Olympic Games is \\"probably the most significant covert manipulation of the electromagnetic spectrum since World War II, when Polish cryptanalystsRejewski, Marian. \\"How Polish Mathematicians Broke the Enigma Cipher.\\" Annals of the History of Computing 3, no. 3 (July 1981): 213–34. doi:10.1109/MAHC.1981.10033. broke the Enigma cipher that allowed access to Nazi codes.\\" The New Yorker claims Operation Olympic Games is \\"the first formal offensive act of pure cyber sabotage by the United States against another country, if you do not count electronic penetrations that have preceded conventional military attacks, such as that of Iraq's military computers before the invasion of 2003.\\" Therefore, \\"American and Israeli official action can stand as justification for others.\\" The Washington Post reported that Flame malware was also part of Olympic Games. Leak investigation In June 2013, it was reported that Cartwright was the target of a year-long investigation by the US Department of Justice into the leak of classified information about the operation to the US media. In March 2015, it was reported that the investigation had stalled amid concerns that necessary evidence for prosecution was too sensitive to reveal in court. Referring to unnamed sources within the CIA and NSA, the documentary film Zero Days claims that the Stuxnet/Olympic Games malware was just a small part of a much larger mission to infiltrate and compromise Iran—\\"Nitro Zeus\\" (NZ).

The Radium Queen was a cargo/tug ship that served on the Slave River. It made runs between Lake Athabaska and Great Slave Lake is generally navigable. The Radium Queen towed barges from the railhead at Waterways, Alberta to a portage around the rapids. Cargo was unloaded there and transported by land, and loaded on barges on the lower river that were towed by the Radium King, and later by other tugboats, like the Radium Charles, Radium Express and Radium Yellowknife. It was built at the Manseau Shipyards, then disassembled and shipped by railroad to Waterways. The Radium Queen was shipped first, and reassembled at Waterways, so she could tow the parts to assemble the Radium King downstream to the rapids on the Slave River. The parts to the Radium King were then portaged around the rapids to be assembled on the lower reaches. In 2005 Atomic Energy of Canada published a study of the toxic legacy of the mining of radioactive ore at Port Radium.

Birth  Syed Shah Murshed Ali Alquadri Al Jilani was born on Friday, the 27th of Ramadan, 1268 A.H /16 July 1852 AD at the Khanqah Sharif of Piyardanga, P.S Chandrakona, now West Midnapore.Tazkeratul Maula, Abu Taher, Vol I, Agra, p 28 He was commonly known as “Huzur Purnoor” and “Maula Pak”. He was the eldest son and Sajjada nashin Syed Shah Mehr Ali Alquadri Al Baghdadi commonly known as “Aala Huzur”. His mother was Syeda Ummul Barkat Khatun Fatima Saniya. She was from the descendant of Syed Isa Rizvi, who came from Bukhara and settled at Payardanga in the district of Midnapore. Huzur Purnoor was born in the auspicious night of Shab-e- Qadar,Tazkeratul Maula, Abu Taher, Vol I, Agra, p 27 (the night of Power). It is commonly believed that the Quran was revealed at this night.  Early life  Huzur Purnoor would pass most of his early days in spiritual thought. Even in his childhood he showed his spiritual powers. There are numerous Keramat of Huzur Purnoor, only one is narrated here. When he was a child, a student named Sajjad Karim of the Madrasah which was attached to the Khanqah purposely disturbed Huzur Purnoor and did not allow him to write. Huzur Purnoor, annoyed, threw the inkpot of the boy into a well. At this the boy complained to the Maulvi of the Madrasah who on enquiry found the complaint to be true. The Maulvi said that Huzur should have complained to him instead of throwing the inkpot of a poor boy into the well. Huzur Purnoor then pointed to a niche and said that the ink pot was there. It was actually found there though all students had seen that it was thrown into the well.Murshed -i- Azam, Syed Md Hedayat Hossain, MSS, Quadria Academy,Kolkata ff 13-15  Education  Syedena Aala Huzur, the father of Huzur Purnoor, took upon himself the charge of education and spiritual training of his son. In order to accustom him to asceticism his father would often, at the dead of night, to make him go through the most difficult spiritual exercises. Huzur Purnoor was highly intelligent and possessed extraordinary memory.Modern Indian Mysticism, Bobharani Basu, Varanasi, 1st Ed. 1974, Vol II, p 412 He got by heart his lessons by reading them only once and retained them throughout his life. At a very early age he mastered the commentaries of the Quran, Hadith, principles of Fiqah and Islamic Jurisprudence, Logic, and other subjects. He was the master of all branches of Knowledge. He had a great love for Hadith too. In his presence the difficult books of Hadith would often be recited. He had a large collection of books relating to the subject of Hadith.  Spiritual exercises  Huzur Purnoor would offer five time prayers with great regularity and punctuality. Apart from this he spent most of his time in Nafal Ibadat, Moraqaba, Mushada, Dhikr and Wazifa. He observed fast throughout the year (except the days in which fast is forbidden). He would eat only a few morsels after midnight.Gulistan-i- Qadri, Mahbub Murshed, Calcutta,1946 A.D,1st Ed Cal 1987 p 54 He would count his string of beads throughout the day and night if not engaged in reciting the Quran or in contemplation or in other mode of prayers. For years he passed his life in the woods of “Gop” (a high woody place on the bank of river Kangsabati) in Midnapore and continued with his meditation, asceticism and abstinence. He passed far beyond the stage of Fanaa and attained the stage of Baqaa. Moreover he became Qutb of his time.  Journeys  After spending a long time in jungle, Huzur Purnoor began to travel all over India for preaching Islam and guiding the Muslims, stopping at the shrines of the saints. In the beginning he would walk on foot, but later he would travel by train wherever there was railway. He toured frequently in the districts of Bengal. Apart from this he also visited Faridpur and Chittagong now in Bangladesh and many places in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan.Silsilahtuz Zahab, Syed Hedayat Hussain, MSS, p 52  His Guidance  Thousands of people from different parts of world, irrespective of caste, creed and religion received spiritual blessings from Huzur Purnoor and became his devoted disciple (Murid). At a stage almost the whole elite Muslim class of Bengal became his murid. Among his followers Khondokar Yusuf Ali, Bar at Law, father of Mr. H.N. Khondokar, Justice of Calcutta High Court, Shamsul Ulema Velayat Hussian, Head Maulvi, Calcutta Madrasah, Habibul Hassan, Assistant Inspector of Schools, Syed Shah Abdul Malik, Deputy Magistrate Deputy Collector, Khan Bahadur Abdul Ghaffar, Additional Chief Presidency Magistrate, Calcutta deserves special mention.  Family life  Huzur Purnoor married twice. His first wife Syeda Salehatunnesa better known as Subah Bibi was from the family of a great saint of Bengal Syedena Ruhullah Al Hussaini who was the descendant of Imam Hussian. His second wife Syeda Najmunnesa Khatun was the daughter of Hafiz Syed Fateh Ali of Arrah in Bihar.Tazkaeatul Moula, Vol I,p 150 Huzur Purnoor had four sons and two daughters. His first wife bore him three son i.e Syed Shah Arshad Ali Alquadri, Syed Shah Irshad Ali Alquadri, who was his spiritual successor (Sajjadanashin), Syed Shah Rashed Ali Alquadri, and a daughter Syeda Amatul Fatma. His second wife bore him one daughter Syeda Saghira Khatun and a son Syed Shah Khurshid Ali Alquadri.Kashkaul Shamsi Baghdad, Syed Shah Khurshid Ali,MSS, Islamic Centre ,Calcutta, p 12,13,14,15  Death  Huzur Purnoor's death took place on 27th of Shawal, 1318 A.H, corresponding to 17 February 1901 AD and 4th Falgun 1307 B.S.Tazkeratul Moula, Vol II, p,166 The prayer of Janazah was led by famous Islamic scholar Maulana Khairuddin Sahab, father of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. It was in accordance with the wish of Huzur Purnoor. It so happened that during those days Maulana Khairuddin was staying in Mumbai and was very sick. At this stage one night he dreamt Huzur Purnoor, who was calling him for leading his Janazah prayer. The very next day Maulana set out for Calcutta by train, after arriving he got the news of Huzur Purnoor s’ demise. He hurried to the Khanqah Sharif and led the congregation of Janazah prayer. Huzur Purnoor was buried in the family burial ground at Mia Mohallah in Midnapore Town. There is also a mosque attached to the Shrine. It is known as Jora Masjid to the local people. The Urs Sharif (Death Anniversary) of this great saint is celebrated every year with great pomp and grandeur in Midnapore.MidnaporeIn this connection a big Mela or Fair known as Mina Bazar Mela is also held near the holy shrine. A special train also runs from Bangladesh to Midnapore on this occasion.  Works  Huzur Purnoor was an eminent writer and a unique Sufi poet. He composed a diwanTazkeratul Maula, Vol I, p 40 namely “Diwan-i-Hazrat-i-Jamal” which has been published many times. This Diwan is abundantly read throughout the sub continent. It contains Ghazals (odes) in Urdu. His nom-de-plume was Aasi and Jamal. The diwan is deeply religious in thought and inspired by the spirit of Islamic mysticism. In prose his master piece work is Toghra -i- Mahamed written in simple Persian on the life and achievements of Syedena Aala Huzur. Besides, he wrote many valuable treatises on Sufism. His letters are also good example of his literary scholarship.

Many members of this family have no known function and are predicted to be integral membrane proteins and many of the proteins contain two copies of the domain.  Domain  EamA was previously called DUF6 (domain unknown function) 6, and was one of the first DUF families to appear in Pfam. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis indicates that this family contains four stable sub-families with high bootstrap values: SLC35C/E, SLC35F, SLC35G (acyl-malonyl condensing enzyme-like AMAC), and purine permeases. The EamA HMM domain organization shows the two domain structure of EamA. However, the entries for UAA, Nuc_sug_transp, and DUF914, which may likely have derived from EamA, the HMM covers the duplicated structure as a single HMM.  Function  AMAC (acyl-malonyl condensing enzyme) is an interchangeable, but more general biochemical term than FAE 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1, which would refer only to synthase #1. However, the transmembrane structure indicates that AMACs are transporters, not enzymes. Hence TMEM20, TMEM22, AMAC1 and AMAC-like (AMAC1L1, AMAC1L2, AMAC1L3) sequences have been renamed to SLC35Gs in RefSeq for Human and Mouse (SLC35G1 – 6). Furthermore, EamA is the only drug/metabolite transporter family to cross the prokaryote/eukaryote border, even though none of the original families crossed this border. The highly diverse EamA Pfam family has been created by iterative expansion of the original dataset.  Evolution  The likely evolutionary order of human 5 + 5 TM nucleotide sugar transporters is identified. It was done by training HMMs on each halve of these proteins: EamA, TPT, DUF914, UAA, and NST. The first method was multidimensional scaling in IBM SPSS, where a matrix of pairwise similarity measures from HMM-HMM comparisons was used as input. The output was a graph, showing a clear bipartitioning between DMT-1 and DMT-2 domains, where EamA-1 and EamA-2 were clearly in the middle. This result could be interpreted that EamA duplicated, and that the other families represent “diverged” copies from EamA. The distance (100-p) between domain halves was measured, and the families were sorted by the following distances: EamA (smallest distance between domain halves), TPT, DUF914, UAA, and NST (highest distance between domain halves). What was perhaps surprising was that this order also replicated the distance to EamA, so that NST had the highest “distance” to EamA, UAA the second highest, and so on. The possibility that EamA (previously DUF6) may be an “artifact”, that has formed a \\"multipotent\\" HMM through iterative expansion of a diverse seed data, should be considered. During DNA replication of circular bacterial genomes, multiple proteins are involved in synthesizing the leading strand, and the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. If a sequence contains an inverted repeat (a palindrome) longer than 10 bp, and a spacer/insert of less than 75-150 basepairs, the sequence could be accessible to SbcCD, a protein which inhibits the propagation of replicons containing long palindromic DNA sequences. Watson-Crick basepairing of the palindrome, and a break in the sequence may occur, creating an opportunity for priming DNA synthesis in the opposite direction. This may be followed by spontaneous strand switching and continuation of normal replication. This phenomenon is referred to as Tandem Inversion Duplication (TID). Then there may have been degradation of the third (inverted) copy which would be in the middle. Strand slippage deletion (illegitimate recombination) may be responsible. The presence of two palindromes in the regional duplication may increase the probability of degradation. A concrete bioinformatic example could be a DUF606 protein, known to exist in both paired and fused copies in bacterial genomes, where a DUF606 protein (Accession: ACL39356.1) from Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6, has a 5+5 TM structure and matches 2 x DUF606 HMM in Pfam, and thus appears to be duplicated. When the genomic sequence (1530600 – 1531700) of the protein from Arthrobacter is obtained, it is found that it contains a palindrome ( and ) in the middle of the domain halves, although it may be too short and have too long a spacer to be able to initiate a new TID.

He lost his Parliamentary seat at the Liberal landslide at the 1906 general election but regained the seat as a Conservative in the January 1910 general election. The constituency was abolished in 1918 and Jessel never returned to the House of Commons. He was the Conservative candidate for the 1921 Westminster St George's by- election. He was created a Baronet, of Westminster, in 1917, made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918 and an officer of the Order of Leopold and Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1919. In 1924 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Jessel, of Westminster in the County of London. Lord Jessel married Maud Goldsmid, daughter of Sir Julian Goldsmid, 3rd Baronet, in 1894. They had several children. Lord Jessel died in November 1950, aged 84, and was succeeded by his only son, Edward. Lady Jessel died in October 1965.

It was named after Heinrich Bernhard von dem Appelle.Tileman Dothias Wiarda: Ostfriesische Geschichte, vol. 7, Aurich, 1797 Heinrich Bernard was one of the leaders of the rebellious faction, who were called the renitents. He owned the Groß-Midlum manor in KrummhörnWolfgang Rüther: Hausbau zwischen Landes- und Wirtschaftsgeschichte. Die Bauernhäuser der Krummhörn vom 16. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert, thesis, Münster, 1999, p. 34 online (PDF, 297 pages, 1.8 MB) and was the administrator of the chamber of knights in the Estates of East Frisia. Background There had been violent confrontations for decades between the Counts and later Princes of East Frisia and the Estates, in particular the City of Emden. There were many disputes, mostly about taxation, responsibilities for various issues, and property rights. Some disputes had been resolved by compromises, such as the Agreement of the Hague and the Agreement of Osterhusen. In the early 18th century, there were fresh tensions between the Prince and a \\"disobedient\\" faction of the Estate known as the renitent faction. The trigger was the Christmas flood of 1717, which caused widespread destruction in coastal parts of the principality. The county was deeply divided on the question of who should finance the necessary repairs. Both the Prince and the Estates had set up a fund to finance the repairs, and both sides claimed to have the authority to raise a special tax to fill these funds. War On 28 April 1724, the city of Emden called on its possession Oldersum to prepare for war and arm themselves. On 2 February 1726, troops from Emden fought a battle in Leer against the princely troops. The latter were victorious. Soon afterwards, the renitent faction was condemned in an imperial decree. The conflict, however, continued and on 7 April 1726, another battle was fought in the streets of Leer, killing and wounding many soldiers. In April 1727, the Prince called in reinforcements from Denmark. A group of 60 men from Oldersum united with troops from Emden and other localities in the Emden area and marched to Norden, where they lost another battle against the Prince's army. Another imperial decree again condemned the renitent faction and ordern them to pay reparations. The Prince took over the administration of Oldersum from the city of Emden, and imperial troops occupied the castle at Oldersum. When the conflict ended, the Prince emerged victoriously and the recalcitrant city of Emden had to submit to him. However, the Prince had won a Pyrrhic victory. Aftermath The Appeal war had a significant impact on the subsequent history of East Frisia and the annexation by Prussia a few years later. The poor negotiating skills of Enno Rudolph Brenneysen, Prince George Albert's chancellor, prevented a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Although the Prince and his chancellor demanded that the renitents be punished severely, the Emperor pardoned the rebels in 1732. George Albert died on 11 June 1734 and his son Charles Edzard inherited the principality. However, Charles Edzard also found himself unable to resolve the conflict. Around this time, East Frisia began to prepare for the Prussian annexation. After the Appeal war, the city of Emden found itself politically isolated and economically weakened. It aimed to regain its position as the county seat and commercial center and in 1740, Emden decided to seek Prussian assistance to achieve this goal. The city wanted to protect its economic position and sought Prussian acknowledgement of its existing privileges. In return, the Estates would recognize Prussia's right to annex the county. On 14 March 1744, two treaties were concluded on economic matters. Prussia mainly relied on its right to take over if the Cirksena family failed to produce a male heir, which had been granted to Prussia by Emperor Leopold I in 1694. Despite objections from the Kingdom of Hanover, King Frederick II of Prussia annexed East Frisia in 1744, after the last Cirksena prince died.

It is a small shrub with hairy branches, cylindrical or linear to elliptic or oblong leaves and red, pinkish red, or orange flowers arranged singly in leaf axils. Description Prostanthera aspalathoides is a compact, upright shrub that typically grows to a height of and has densely hairy, glandular branchlets. The aromatic leaves are cylindrical to linear-elliptic in shape, long, wide and sessile or on a petiole up to long. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils with bracteoles long at the base. The sepals are long and joined at the base to form a tube long. The petals are long forming a red, pinkish red, orange or rarely yellow tube long. Flowering mainly occurs in spring but flowers may be present in most months. Taxonomy and naming Prostanthera aspalathoides was first formally described in 1834 by George Bentham in his book Labiatarum genera et species, from an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham who collected the type specimens near the Lachlan River. The specific epithet alludes to a similarity to plants of the genus Aspalathus. Distribution and habitat Scarlet mint bush grows in mallee and occurs in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It is found west from the Rankins Springs district in New South Wales, in the northern half of Victoria and in the south-east of South Australia, including the Yorke and Eyre Peninsulas and Kangaroo Island. Uses=Use in horticulture Prosthanthera aspalthioides is best adapted to cultivation in dry conditions with low humidity. Plants prefer a position in full sun or partial shade with good drainage and withstand moderate frost. Cuttings are the preferred propagation method, as seed germinates slowly. Plants may also be grafted on roostocks of the hardier species Prostanthera nivea. Fragrant oil Tests to extract cineole (also known as eucalyptol), a fragrant oil found in Prostanthera were conducted over 100 years ago by Joseph Bosisto an industrial chemist and oil distiller. Later tests on Prostanthera aspalathoides produced an oil yield of 2-3%.

He was most notable for his conflict with District Attorney Jim Garrison and his work as investigator for automobile industry executive John DeLorean and U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark. Early life Novel grew up in New Orleans living as an only child with his mother. He graduated from East Jefferson High School in 1956, spent a brief period studying engineering at Northrop Aeronautical Institute of Technology, the University of Southern California and tried motion picture directing classes at the Pasadena Playhouse. He met his former wife, Marlene Mancuso, Miss New Orleans 1958, at the Louisiana State University. Career In 1960, Novel bought a dragstrip in Hammond, Louisiana, together with associate Ranny Ehlinger. Later he produced auto shows in New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Atlanta. Bay of Pigs weapons In February 1961 Novel was part of a group of people which took weapons from a munitions bunker in Houma, Louisiana, which was owned by the Schlumberger Company. The action was planned by Guy Banister and David Ferrie, who at the time were actively involved in the anti-communist/anti-Castro groups. According to a report in the New Orleans States-Item newspaper Banister served as a munitions supplier for the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and continued to deal weapons from his office until 1963.New Orleans States-Item, April 25, 1967 Gus Russo has written about the existence of a letter of marque, signed by Robert F. Kennedy, who was U.S. Attorney General at the time, which supposedly gave Banister the go-ahead to \\"liberate\\" the weaponry. Novel had received a key to the bunker from Banister. The munitions were stored at Banister's office in Camp Street, New Orleans,( Ammunition was never stored at the offices of Mr. Banister on Camp Street in New Orleans)(Personal knowledge of Allen Campbell) and at Ferrie's house. Novel claimed that the act was not illegal but had been arranged by the CIA as part of Operation Mongoose. While taking a lie detector test, Novel stated that the burglary was not a burglary at all, but a war materials pickup made at the direction of his CIA contact. 1964 New York World's Fair In the early 60's, Novel served as Director of Operations for the 'Bourbon Street Pavilion' at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The pavilion reportedly achieved the highest gross income of any single commercial pavilion at the fair. For this work, Novel was called an \\"Entrepreneurial Prodigy & Boy Wonder\\"\\" in Variety. From the beginning of the fair's build-up in 1963 he handled publicity at the pavilion, using the name \\"G. Michael Novel\\" he gave several interviews to the press. Variety magazine recognized him as being the major entertainment buyer, in charge of the pavilion's entertainment policies and originally active in obtaining backing for the venture. Owner and founder of 'Mardi Gras World', Blaine Kern, worked with Novel at both the 1964 World's Fair and the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition. New Orleans business After the world fair closed, Novel moved back to New Orleans, where he set up a business focused on electronic eavesdropping. Through his company, 'International Dynamics Corp', he manufactured and installed electronics for politicians, businessmen and diplomats. He also bought/leased a Caribbean-style restaurant/club called 'Jamaican Village Inn', which was located at 800 North Rampart Street. While Novel was in Ohio, resisting Garrison's attempt to get him extradited, two waitresses of the club were arrested and charged with violating obscenity law, for topless table-serving. The club was ordered to be padlock closed for one year by the district attorney's office. This order was withdrawn after the club owner Edward Centa agreed to end the topless attire, while the lease to Novel was ruled invalid. Conflict with GarrisonWork at Garrison's office= Without Garrison's knowledge, Novel was directed by Walter Sheridan (Federal investigator, NBC News reporter and associate of the Kennedy family) to seek work as an operative inside Garrison's office. Willard E. Robertson (a petitioner and businessman with political connections and ally of Jim Garrison and Louisiana Governor John McKeithen, who was alleged to have lent financial support to Garrison's investigation of Clay Shaw through an organization known as \\"Truth or Consequences\\") recommended Novel as a \\"electronics expert\\" to District Attorney Jim Garrison. He was assigned to \\"debug\\" Garrison's offices at the corner of Tulane Avenue & S Broad Street in New Orleans. Years later, during the time an appeal in the Waco trial reached its end, a secret FBI report was released which stated that Novel worked with Garrison in attempts to fake photographic evidence to link Fidel Castro with the assassination. However, according to the final report issued by the Assassination Records Review Board, Novel came to the attention of Garrison after allegedly making claims that he was an employee of the CIA in 1963 and knew both Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby. Journalist Dick J. Reavis has stated that Novel's work at Garrison's office was \\"amply documented\\" and quoted Novel saying: \\"I was working as Garrison's chief of security, while at the same time working for the White House to destabilize Garrison's operation.\\" =Shaw Hearing Witness Subpoena= During Clay Shaw's preliminary hearing, Novel was twice subpoenaed to appear before the Orleans Parish Grand Jury. The second time Novel did not show up, while he had left the state. In order to get Novel extradited, Garrison's office issued two warrants for Novel's arrest. The first arrest warrant was based on him being a material witness in the Clay Shaw investigation, which historically labeled him as \\"the missing witness\\" in Garrison's assassination conspiracy theory. The second arrest warrant was based on a new accusation; Garrison accused Novel of having \\"burglarized\\" the munitions bunker in Houma. During the same time-frame, on 25 May 1967, the New Orleans States-Item published a detailed article on the Clay Shaw case. In that article the New Orleans States-Item produced a handwritten letter, that experts identified as Novel's handwriting, which referred to a CIA connection to his advertising agency. Until then Novel had publicly denied any CIA connections. After the letter was revealed, Novel's attorney, Steve Plotkin, said that Novel wrote the letter and that Novel had CIA connections in New Orleans. While holding off his extradition, Novel organized a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, where he publicly defended himself against Garrison's accusation of burglary. During the conference, reporters were told that; there were CIA operations in New Orleans, an advertising agency in New Orleans (which was operated by Novel) did indeed serve as a CIA front, that the raid on the Houma munitions bunker was a \\"patriotic act\\". Later on, Plotkin further specified Novel's role as an \\"intermediary\\", but added that Novel's work had \\"little or nothing to do with the Bay of Pigs invasion and certainly had absolutely nothing to do with the assassination of President Kennedy\\". The extradition proceedings were eventually dropped on 3 July 1967, due to defects/incomplete extradition papers. Novel vs Garrison-Playboy Libel Suit In an October 1967 interview for Playboy Magazine, Garrison accused Novel of being a paid employee of the CIA and hinted at complicity in the JFK assassination. Subsequently, Novel filed a $10-million libel suit against Garrison and Playboy in Federal Court, being represented by Elmer Gertz, who was an expert in reputation damage and smear campaigns. In his book \\"To Life\\" Gertz stated that Novel's deposition ran into \\"hundreds, if not thousands, of pages\\". Eventually, the case did not come to trial but was instead dismissed by Judge William J. Campbell after the defendants moved for a reconsideration of their motions. J. Edgar Hoover allegations In an episode of the PBS program Frontline aired on February 9, 1993, Novel said he saw photos of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover engaged in oral sex with his aide Clyde Tolson. The episode incorporated the work of author Anthony Summers whose book Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover alleged that Novel said he was shown the photo by CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton. Watergate In 1974, columnist Jack Anderson wrote that Charles Colson consulted Novel on the possible use of a degaussing device that could erase copies of the Watergate tapes stored in at the White House and the CIA from a distance. Eventually, Colson and Novel mutually decided not to do this, because of its danger to other national security tapes and computers. According to Colson, the plan never came close to development. New Orleans firebomb case Jim Garrison's successor to the seat of district attorney Harry Connick Sr. brought charges against Novel for conspiracy to firebomb part of New Orleans by balloons on behalf of a world's fair Novel was promoting. After three previous prosecutions, that included a hung jury, a mistrial and a conviction with three-year sentence, the conviction was overturned due to \\"tremendous conflicts\\" in government testimony. Columnist Jack Anderson reported that \\"Eminent legal scholars say a fourth prosecution in a non-capital case is virtually unprecedented, and raises the issue of retaliatory prosecution\\". Connick denied there was intention to \\"persecute\\" Novel. DeLorean Novel worked as private investigator to the DeLorean Motor Company chairman John DeLorean in 1982, and subsequently became a business partner. DeLorean claimed there was a conspiracy between Britain's Conservative Party and U.S. and British intelligence agents to close DeLorean's manufacturing plant in Northern Ireland. DeLorean's claims relied on Gordon Novel's investigation and resulting evidence. The alleged conspiracy included an attempt to frame/entrap DeLorean for cocaine trafficking, against which DeLorean eventually successfully defended himself in the resulting lawsuit. Part of the defense was an audiotape, which was made public by Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, which revealed DeLorean was the victim of a sting operation. When Flynt refused to name Novel as the supplier of the tape, he was charged and convicted to a 5½ month sentence for contempt of court. Waco Novel was hired as chief investigator by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, in the aftermath of the Waco Siege of 1993. Ramsey Clark provided legal counsel for some of the surviving members of Branch Davidian, as well as more than a hundred family members of those who had died or were injured in the confrontation. Novel has stated that his analysis of a FLIR tape, made by a Nightstalker aircraft, indicates serious misconduct, e.g. federal agents firing upon people inside the compound while they were trying to flee the fire. Former CIA Director William Colby collaborated with Novel on the investigation of misconduct on the higher levels of command including the FBI. Novel originated allegations that U.S. Federal agents were guilty of murdering David Koresh's followers during the Waco siege. Celebrity advice As a private investigator, Novel gave strategic advice to various celebrities, among which were Michael Jackson and Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Finnish entrepreneur Armi Ratia (1912–1979), founder of the Marimekko textile and home decorating company. Female entrepreneurs are women who organize and manage an enterprise, especially a business. Female entrepreneurship has steadily increased in the United States during the 20th and 21st century, with female owned businesses increasing at a rate of 5% since 1997. This increase gave rise to wealthy self-made females such as Coco Chanel, Diane Hendricks, Meg Whitman, and Oprah Winfrey.  History  The first female owned business in the United States is recorded in 1739 when Eliza Lucas Pinckney took over her family's plantations in South Carolina when she was 16 years old. In the 18th and 19th centuries, females operated small businesses as a result of inheritance or as a way of supplementing their income. In many cases, they were trying to avoid poverty or were replacing the income from the loss of a spouse. At that time, the ventures that these women undertook were not thought of as entrepreneurial. Many of them had to focus on their domestic responsibilities. For instance, with longstanding and significant barriers to educational and alternative employment opportunities, Black women were historically relegated to low-paying jobs and domestic work—particularly in the Jim Crow South. As a result, Black women of the early 20th century developed entrepreneurial niches in dressmaking, Black hair care, private home domestic work and midwifery. Lower levels of wealth, access to capital, racial discrimination and inadequate networks have been and continue to be barriers to entrepreneurship women of color face.Walker’s Legacy. (2016). “Black Women Entrepreneurs: Past and Present Conditions of Black Women’s Business Ownership.” Walker’s Legacy. The term entrepreneur is used to describe individuals who have ideas for products and/or services that they turn into a working business. In earlier times, this term was reserved for men.\\"From Ideas to Independence A Century of Entrepreneurial Women.\\" Entrepreneurs.nwhm.org. N.p., n.d. Web. Women became more involved in the business world only when the idea of women in business became palatable to the general public; however, this does not mean that there were no female entrepreneurs until that time. In the 17th century, Dutch colonists who came to what is now known as New York City, operated under a matriarchal society. In this society, many women inherited money and lands, and through this inheritance, became business owners. One of the most successful women from this time was Margaret Hardenbrook Philipse, who was a merchant, a ship owner, and was involved in the trading of goods.Bostwick, Heleigh. \\"History's Top Women Entrepreneurs.\\" LegalZoom: Online Legal Document Services: LLC, Wills, Incorporation, Divorce & More. N.p., March 2009. Web. 18 Apr. 2014. During the mid 18th century, it was popular for women to own certain businesses like brothels, alehouses, taverns, and retail shops. Most of these businesses were not perceived with good reputations because it was considered shameful for women to be in these positions. Society frowned upon women involved in such businesses; because, they detracted from the women's supposed gentle and frail nature. During the 18th and 19th centuries, more women came out from under the oppression of society's limits, and began to emerge into the public eye. Despite the disapproval of society, women such as Rebecca Lukens flourished. In 1825, Lukens took over the family business, Brandywine Iron Works & Nail Factory, and turned it into a profit-generating steel business. In the 1900s, due to a more progressive way of thinking, and the rise of feminism, female entrepreneurs began to be a widely accepted term. Although these female entrepreneurs serviced mostly female consumers, they were making great strides. Women gained the right to vote in 1920, and two years later, Clara and Lillian Westropp started the institution of Women's Savings & Loan as a way of teaching women how to be smart with their money. As society progressed, female entrepreneurs became more influential. With the boom of the textile industry and the development of the railroad and telegraph system, women such as Madame C. J. Walker took advantage of the changing times. Walker was able to market her hair care products in a successful way, becoming the first African American female millionaire. Carrie Crawford Smith was the owner of an employment agency opened in 1918, and like Madame C. J. Walker, sought to provide help to many women by giving them opportunities to work. During the Great Depression, some of the opportunities afforded to women took a backseat and society seemed to reverse its views, reverting to more traditional roles. This affected women working in business; however, it also served as a push to those involved in the entrepreneurial world. More women began to start their own businesses, looking to survive during this time of hardship. In 1938, Hattie Moseley Austin, who had begun to sell chicken and biscuits after her husband died, opened Hattie's Chicken Shack in Saratoga Springs, New York. During World War II, many women entered the workforce, filling jobs that men had left behind to serve in the military. Some women, of their own accord, took these jobs as a patriotic duty while others started businesses of their own. One of these women was Pauline Trigere, who came to New York from Paris in 1937, started a tailoring business that later turned into a high-end fashion house. Another woman was Estée Lauder, who was working on the idea for her beauty products which officially launched in 1946, a year after the war ended. When the war ended, many women still had to maintain their place in the business world; because, many of the men who returned were injured. The National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs were sources of encouragement to female entrepreneurs. They often would hold workshops with already established entrepreneurs, such as Elizabeth Arden, who would give advice. During the 1950s, women found themselves surrounded by messages everywhere, stating what their role should be. Domesticity was the overall public concern and a theme that was highly stressed during this time, and women had to juggle combined home responsibilities and their career. Home- based businesses helped to solve a good part of the problem for those women who worried about being mothers. Lillian Vernon, while pregnant with her first child, started her own business dealing with catalogs by investing money from wedding gifts and started filling orders right at her kitchen table. Mary Crowley founded Home Decorating and Interiors as a way of helping women to work from home by throwing parties to sell the products right in the comfort of their own home. In an effort to avoid criticism and lost business from those who did not support women in business, Bette Nesmith, who developed the product \\"Mistake Out,\\" a liquid that painted over mistakes in typing, would sign her orders B. Smith so no one would know she was a female. From the 1960s to the late 1970s, another change came about when divorce rates rose and many women were forced back into the role of being the sole provider. This pushed them back into the working world, where they were not well received. When the recession hit, many of these women were the first to be without work. Once again, the entrepreneurial endeavors of women came to the rescue as an effort of asserting themselves, and aiding other women in being a part of the workforce. Mary Kay Ash and Ruth Fertel of Ruth's Chris Steak House were part of that movement. The 1980s and 1990s were a time of reaping the benefits from the hard work of women who worked tirelessly for their rightful place in the workforce as employees and entrepreneurs. Martha Stewart and Vera Bradley were among the twenty-first percent women who owned businesses. The public was also becoming more receptive and encouraging to these female entrepreneurs, acknowledging the valuable contribution they were making to the economy. The National Association of Women Business Owners helped to push Congress to pass the Women's Business Ownership Act in 1988, which would end discrimination in lending and also strike down laws that required married women to acquire their husband's signature for all loans. In addition, the Act also gave women-owned businesses a chance to compete for government contracts. Another monumental moment for women in business was the appointment of Susan Engeleiter as head of the US government's Small Business Administration in 1989. In the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, there was more of a focus on networking opportunities in the world of female entrepreneurs. There were many opportunities that came about to help those who were interested in starting up their own businesses. Support groups, organizations for educating the female entrepreneur, and other opportunities like seminars and help with financing came from many different sources, such as the Women's Business Development Center and Count Me In. Despite all these advances, the female entrepreneurs still fell behind when compared to their male counterparts. As the 1990s came in, the availability of computers and the increasing popularity of the internet gave a much needed boost to women in business. This technology allowed them to be more prevalent in the business world and showcase their skills to their competitors. Even with the increased popularity of women in business, the availability of technology and the support from different organizations, female entrepreneurs today are still struggling. The economic downturn of 2008 did not serve to help them in their quest. However, with the continual attention given to female entrepreneurs and the educational programs afforded to women who seek to start out with their own business ventures, there is much information and help available. Since 2000, there has been an increase in small and big ventures by women, including one of their biggest obstacles—financing. \\"From Ideas to Independence: A Century of Entrepreneurial Women  National Womens' History Museum.\\" From Ideas to Independence: A Century of Entrepreneurial Women  National Womens' History Museum. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2014. Vartika Manasvi is among those who chose Canada over the US. According to her, \\"there’s no longevity there.\\"  Demographics  Studies have shown that successful female entrepreneurs start their businesses as a second or third profession. Because of their previous careers, female entrepreneurs enter the business world later on in life, around 40–60 years old. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report, “women are nearly one-third more likely to start businesses out of necessity than men.” Because women are overtaking their male peers in the level of education obtained, having higher education degrees is one of the significant characteristics that many successful female entrepreneurs have in common. The average self-employment rate for women under 25 years old in OECD countries is 7.2%. The number of self-employed women has steadily increased over the past three decades, putting them at an approximate thirty-three percent increase. Many female-owned businesses continue to be home-based operations. These types of businesses usually have limited revenue with about eighty percent of them making less than $50,000 in 2002. This group made up for about six percent of total women-owned businesses. Children of these female entrepreneurs are expected to boost that number as they contribute to the growing number of female entrepreneurs. Most women-owned businesses are in wholesale, retail trade, and manufacturing. Female entrepreneurs have also made a name for themselves in professional, scientific, and technical services, as well as in healthcare and social assistance. In the majority of OECD countries, female entrepreneurs are more likely to work in the services industry than their male counterparts. In 1972, women-owned businesses accounted for 4.6 percent of all U.S. businesses—that was about 1.5 million self-employed women. That number increased to 2.1 million in 1979 and 3.5 million in 1984. In 1997, there were about 5.4 million women-owned businesses and in 2007, that number increased to 7.8 million. The participation of females in entrepreneurial activities does of course vary in different levels around the world. For example, in Pakistan, female entrepreneurs account for only 1% of this gender's population, while in Zambia 40% of women are engaged in this activity. The highest number of females involved in entrepreneurial activities can be seen in Sub-Saharan Africa, with 27% of the female population. Latin America/Caribbean economies show comparatively high percentages as well (15%). The lower numbers are seen in the MENA/Mid-Asia region with entrepreneurial activities registering at 4%. Developed Europe and Asia, as well as Israel, also show low rates of 5%.  International implications  A recent international study found that women from low to middle income countries (such as Russia and the Philippines) are more likely to enter early stage entrepreneurship when compared to those of higher income countries (such as Belgium, Sweden, and Australia). A significant factor that may play a role in this disparity can be attributed to the fact that women from low-income countries often seek an additional means of income to support themselves and their families. Overall, 40 to 50 percent of all small businesses are owned by women in developing countries.Lemmon, G. (2012). Women entrepreneurs, example not exception [Video]. Alternatively, this may also be because in western business practices, it is not seen as beneficial to exhibit perceived feminine traits. While eastern businesses tend to follow methods based around mutual respect and understanding, western business' expectations are for business leaders to be more ruthless, headstrong, and less sensitive or respectful. \\"In the grab for power, women use whatever means available to them, whereas a man would take a club to his opponents head, a woman is more likely use other less forceful and more subversive measures. Let's just own it, we have different weapons in our arsenal.\\" Female entrepreneurs make up approximately 1/3 of all entrepreneurs globally. According to one study, in 2012 there was an approximate 126 million women that were either starting or already running new businesses in various economies all over the world. As far as those who were already established, there was an approximate 98 million. Not only are these women running or starting their own businesses but they are also employing others, so that they are participating in the growth of their respective economies. A study in India, entitled \\"Barriers of Women Entrepreneurs: A Study in Bangalore Urban District\\", has concluded that despite all these constraints, successful female entrepreneurs do exist. Female entrepreneurs have evidently more to ‘acquire’ than their male counterparts. But, the socio-cultural environment in which women are born and raised hinders them. Social customs, caste restrictions, culture restraints, and norms leave women lagging behind men.Gayathridevi, C.L., 'Barriers of Women Entrepreneurs: A Study in Bangalore Urban District', International Journal of Trends in Economics Management & Technology (IJTEMT), , Vol. 3 Issue 2, April 2014, pp:24–30.  Present challenges  Even though female entrepreneurship and the formation of female-owned business networks is steadily rising, there are a number of challenges and obstacles that female entrepreneurs face. One major challenge for female entrepreneurs face traditional gender-roles that are structurally internalized by society. Entrepreneurship is still considered as a male-dominated field, and it may be difficult to surpass these conventional views. Other than dealing with the dominant stereotype, female entrepreneurs are facing several obstacles related to their businesses.  Human, social, financial capital barriers  One of the arguments the study of gender discrimination in venture capital funding is that the demand for skilled women entrepreneurs is greater than the supply. In 1999, the Diana Project showed that contrary to conventional wisdom, many of the women who were not financed through growth capital had the necessary skills to build a high-growth business. Other research has shown that women entrepreneurs are already launching ambitious businesses in the high- technology industry, expanding their social networks, and making their pitches more relatable to the male-dominated VC industry, despite many industry people believing that women are not doing that. Some studies, though, have looked at the social networks of women entrepreneurs, showing that their networks are different from that of their male counterparts and aren't overlapping as much with financial networks. An entrepreneur's social capital is defined by the networks they have access to, and receiving private equity funding is heavily influenced by an entrepreneur's social capital and whether it overlaps with that of venture capitalists. Thus, women continue being disadvantaged in that respect when looking for private equity funding. Another important factor in receiving private equity funding is an entrepreneur's human capital, derived from education, training and experience. Some studies have shown that women were less likely to have the necessary experience in executive or technical management, since they tended to be more present in the retail, finance, service and real estate sectors. This has led other researchers to study female entrepreneurs with extensive human capital, to identify whether they still face discrimination in their funding search. In a study that used data from MIT Venture Mentoring Service, it was found that women with strong human capital were still less likely to pursue their high-growth business ideas full-time. Education, especially in the STEM fields, is another barrier that women face in achieving the necessary human capital. =Obstacles in Supply Specifically in STEM= STEM related fields are heavily populated by men, and women are extremely underrepresented. Many people believe this issue to be getting better, and although it may be, it is still a large issue that must be addressed on a larger scale. From a study done in 2010 by AAUW, it seems as though the underrepresentation stems from societal norms that cause barriers. Some of these barriers include stereotypes and gender bias. But one of the most important aspects that is often not recognized as much is that some of these barriers come from the way that engineering and mathematics programs at universities are geared more towards men. An example outlined in this study was that a woman going into a math exam naturally feels more pressure due to the idea that men are better at math, and the environment of being in a room with more men would subconsciously affect performance as well. In addition, women having the ability to get out of the mindset that they have a fixed amount of intelligence is imperative in achieving more in the scientific world. There are hundreds of peer-reviewed research papers written focusing on many different aspects of education, specifically regarding STEM, that explain the implicit bias against women. For example, a review, “Males under-estimate academic performance of their female peers in undergraduate biology classrooms”, stated that men rank their fellow male classmates as more knowledgeable than their female peers. There are also issues regarding occupational sex segregation because there is hiring discrimination in the technology and mathematics fields. This is partially due to the way society makes it seem as though it is socially abnormal for women to work in STEM- related fields. In addition, this issue is extremely hard to fix because it is so ingrained in society, but it is important that there are options for girls to get involved in STEM related classes and extracurriculars at a young age in order to create less of an inequality of opportunity. This will also help break the norm that STEM is a man's field.  Gendered processes in finding financing  A different approach to researching the gender discrimination in venture capital funding is studying the gendered processes of looking into financing. It has been shown that in the venture capital world there is a strong tendency towards homophily, meaning that people with a certain backgrounds will associate themselves to individuals with a similar background. This leads to entrepreneurs seeking financing from members of their sex. Their results confirm this hypothesis since only 8.9% of proposals brought to VCs were put forward by women, even though the authors couldn't find a statistically significant difference between the probability for women and men to receive equity. This poses a huge challenge for women entrepreneurs seeking financing from other women, since the number of women venture capitalists has decreased from 10% in 1999 to 6% in 2014, which is why the Diana Project argues that for increasing women-led ventures' access to capital there should be more women VCs. At the same time, these statistics could also be explained by the higher requirements that women face when submitting a proposal for VC financing. In one study, it was found that financing evaluators see women without a technical background as less capable than males without a technical background. Women with a technical background had an advantage to their male counterparts for being evaluated as more sociable and having better leadership skills. This also meant that for women to be seen as legitimate entrepreneurs they needed to exhibit higher qualifications than male entrepreneurs, needing both a technical background and a higher social capital, thus strong social ties with people from the industry. This shows that for evaluators to trust women entrepreneur's abilities they need to see a greater potential in them than in their male counterparts, likely due to gender stereotypes. Other studies, though, have shown that these are not the only obstacles women face due to the stereotypes associated to their gender. Multiple studies on discrimination faced by women seeking financing for their ventures have been built on top of the gender role congruity theory, which states that individuals expect men and women to act in ways that match their gender stereotypes. In one study it was observed that qualities associated to successful entrepreneurs converged to attributes that evaluators assigned to male entrepreneurs, while the characteristics opposite to those of an ideal entrepreneur were generally attributed by evaluators to femininity. This highlights the fact that gender stereotyping is consistently being used in venture capitalists' decision making process. Gender stereotyping in the VCs' decision making was also emphasised in a different study that showed that men and women get asked different questions during their pitches. The questions targeted towards the women entrepreneurs are focused on prevention and loss, while their male counterparts receive questions focused on potential gains. While women got asked questions like: \\"How predictable are your future cash flows?\\", men were asked: \\"What major milestones are you targeting for this year?\\". The authors note that this approach sets up women for failure from the very beginning. Entrepreneurs are not the only ones affected by gender stereotypes. The whole process of seeking financing, from the relationships between entrepreneurs and investors, to the human and social capital have been shown to have gender embedded in them. It has been shown that women tend to emphasise the human and social capital they have, in an effort to compensate for the lack of resources usually associated to the ideal entrepreneur, especially since other studies have shown that the ideal entrepreneur usually has attributes generally associated to male entrepreneurs.[3]In an effort to emphasise their potential, women also tend to stress the involvement of men as board members and board chairs in their ventures. The authors have classified women entrepreneur's strategies that emphasise more \\"masculine\\" attributes of their venture, such as growth ambitions, as compensatory signalling strategies. Another aspect highlighted by this study is that industry experience in \\"feminine\\" industries, such as the spa and fitness industry, is seen as less valuable by investors than experience in industries generally associated to masculinity, such as the petrol industry. Venture capitalist's gendered view of entrepreneur's experience is only one of the examples of having women entrepreneurs held at different standards than their male counterparts. In a study focusing on the financing received by entrepreneurs from banks it was found that male entrepreneurs received more funding than their female counterparts, despite having the same number of employees and past performance track record (two factors that show viability for a business). Thus, women's strong track records did not correlate as strongly with the funding received as for men, and so for the same business attributes their reward was lower.  Obstacles specific to starting new firms  The theory of \\"homophily,\\" is a concept described by social scientists as the tendency for people to seek out or be attracted to those who are similar to themselves. This theory impacts the number of women who are able to start new firms, because there are less women than men who own their own companies; women compose about half of the labor force, but own only 36 percent of US companies. This statistic shows how it is evident that the number of women in this field is disproportionate to the population. Recent data suggests that when female entrepreneurs start their businesses, they have significantly lower levels of capital than men. A disproportionate access to capital, compared to male entrepreneurs, also serves a systemic barrier to creating a new firm. Women who start their own firms have a higher likelihood of success if they have disposable financial or social capital. Without this opportunity, there are many more obstacles that place women at a disadvantage compared to their male counterparts. Women entrepreneurs are starting as a disadvantage when starting their firms, making it more difficult to navigate the initial stages of growing a personal business. Other obstacles include the fact that firms owned by women tend to be smaller than men, are more likely to fail, and have lower levels of sale, profits and employment. Knowing that these barriers exist may serve as a deterrent to female entrepreneurs, or alternatively increase the chance of less successful firms. Structural elements include sex discrimination and internalized stereotypes create these barriers. Furthermore, firms owned by women are predominately part of the service and retail sector. Consolidation of female-run firms in a specific sector highlights internalized stereotypes regarding abilities and interests of female entrepreneurs.  External finance and sex discrimination.  In general, women have lower personal financial assets than men. This means that for a given opportunity and equally capable individual, women must secure additional resources compared to men in order to exploit the opportunity; because, they control less capital. The question of whether women have a harder time getting finance than men for the same business opportunity has developed into its own sub-field.Carter, S., Anderson, S., & Shaw, E. 2001. Women's Business Ownership: A Review of the Academic, Popular and Internet Literature. London, UK: Small Business Service. One possible issue in raising outside capital is that 96% of senior venture capitalists are men and may not be as understanding of female-centric businesses. However, the situation seems to be improving. A study by Babson College showed that in 1999, fewer than 5% of venture capital investments went to companies with a woman on the executive team. In 2011, it was 9% and in 2013 it had jumped to 18%.Weisul, Kimberly. \\"Will the Next Steve Jobs Be a Woman?\\" Inc. (October 2015): 73. A specific solution for solving women's difficulties for obtaining financing has been micro-financing. Microfinance is a financial institution that has become exceptionally popular, especially in developing economies. Female entrepreneurs have also been especially successful in getting funded through crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. Due to lack of funding for women in new businesses many women founders have had to hire or create fake male profiles to act as co-founders, executives, or the face of their businesses to make progress.  Obstacles to managing a small firm  Studies on female entrepreneurs show that women have to cope with stereotypical attitudes towards them on a daily basis. Business relations—from customers to suppliers and banks—constantly remind the entrepreneur that she is different, sometimes in a positive way such as by praising her for being a successful entrepreneur even though she is a woman. Employees tend to mix the perceptions of the manager with their images of female role models, leading to mixed expectations on a female manager to be a manager as well as a \\"mother\\". The workload associated with being a small business manager is also not easily combined with taking care of children and a family. However, even if the revenues are somewhat smaller, female entrepreneurs feel more in control and happier with their situation than if they worked as an employee. Female entrepreneurship has been recognized as an important source of economic growth. Female entrepreneurs create new jobs for themselves and others and also provide society with different solutions to management, organisation, and business problems. However, they still represent a minority of all entrepreneurs. Female entrepreneurs often face gender-based barriers to starting and growing their businesses, like discriminatory property; matrimonial and inheritance laws, and/or cultural practices; lack of access to formal finance mechanisms; limited mobility and access to information and networks, etc. A woman's entrepreneurship can make a particularly strong contribution to the economic well-being of the family and communities, poverty reduction and women's empowerment, thus contributing to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Thus, governments across the world, as well as various developmental organizations, are actively undertaking the promotion of female entrepreneurs through various schemes, incentives and promotional measures. Female entrepreneurs in the four southern states and Maharashtra account for over 50% of all women-led small-scale industrial units in India.  Obstacles to growing firms  A specific problem of female entrepreneurs seems to be their inability to achieve growth, especially sales growth. Another issue is finance and, as stated previously, the entrepreneurial process is somewhat dependent on initial conditions. In other words, as women often have a difficult time assembling external resources, they start as less ambitious firms that can be financed to a greater degree by their own available resources. This also has consequences for the future growth of the firm. Basically, firms with more resources at start-up have a higher probability to grow than firms with fewer resources. Resources include the following: societal position, human resources, and financial resources. This initial endowment in the firm is of great importance for firm survival and especially for firm growth. A study by the Kauffman Foundation of 570 high-tech firms started in 2004 showed that women-owned firms were more likely to be organized as sole proprietorships, both during their startup year and in the years to follow. Female entrepreneurs were also much more likely to start their firms out of their homes and were less likely to have employees. This fact may serve as an indication that women either anticipated having smaller firms or were operating under resource constraints that did not allow them to launch firms requiring more assets, employees, or financial resources. This study also found that women only raised 70% of the amount that men raised to start their firms, which ultimately impacted their ability to introduce new products and services or expand their business in terms of employees or geographic locations. Despite the fact that many female entrepreneurs face growth barriers, they are still able to achieve substantial firm growth. There are examples of these both in a number of developing economies (Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zambia) surveyed by the ILO, as well as in more developed economies such as the United States.  Encouragement  In 1993, \\"Take Our Daughters To Work Day\\" was popularized to support career exploration for girls, and later expanded to Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day. Hillary Clinton stated that \\"Investing in women is not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do.\\"unfoundation.org Research shows that there are many support groups for women in business, for female entrepreneurs, and for women looking for business advice. Women in different areas are willing to show the support that in some cases, they never had. They offer encouragement, advice, and support to moms who seek to provide for their families through their own visions for business. HerCorner, is a group located in Washington, D.C. This groups seeks to bring women business owners together to collaborate with each other for the betterment of their businesses.

Retrieved from http://www.economist.com/node/21526872 One example of successful female entrepreneurship in rural villages of Bangladesh is the Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme (ISEP). Norway celebrates Female Entrepreneur of the Year.  Reasons for launching firms Many studies show that women start their own businesses for a variety of reasons. These reasons include the following: having an idea for a business plan, having passion for solving a specifically related career problem, wanting to be more in control of their careers, maintaining a more balanced life, having a flexible work schedule, and taking a personal vision and turning it into a lucrative business. Along with the intense desire to see their vision carried out, these women also have a great ability to multi-task and never feared the risks involved in being self-employed. Women are still facing many issues in the workforce, and being their own boss certainly is more appealing to some of the everyday issues they face outside of entrepreneurship. Gender roles are still very much a part of their lives, but for some female entrepreneurs, they feel more in control when working for themselves. Feminism A feminist entrepreneur is an individual who applies feminist values and approaches through entrepreneurship, with the goal of improving the quality of life and wellbeing of girls and women. Many are doing so by creating ‘for women, by women’ enterprises.’ Feminist entrepreneurs are motivated to enter commercial markets by desire to create wealth and social change, based on the ethics of cooperation, equality, and mutual respect.Orser, Barbara, and Joanne Leck. \\"Physician as feminist entrepreneur: The gendered nature of venture creation and the Shirley E.

Aside from its category theory definition, one can think of k-graphs as higher dimensional analogue of directed graphs (digraphs). k- here signifies the number of \\"colors\\" of edges that are involved in the graph. If k=1, k-graph is just a regular directed graph. If k=2, there are two different colors of edges involved in the graph and additional factorization rules of 2-color equivalent classes should be defined. The factorization rule on k-graph skeleton is what distinguishes one k-graph defined on the same skeleton from another k-graph. k- can be any natural number greater than or equal to 1. The reason k-graphs were first introduced by Kumjian, Pask et. al. was to create examples of C*-algebra from them. k-graphs consist of two parts: skeleton and factorization rules defined on the given skeleton. Once k-graph is well- defined, one can define functions called 2-cocycles on each graph, and C*-algebras can be built from k-graphs and 2-cocycles. k-graphs are relatively simple to understand from graph theory perspective, yet just complicated enough to reveal different interesting properties in the C*-algebra level. The properties such as homotopy and cohomology on the 2-cocycles defined on k-graphs have implications to C*-algebra and K-theory research efforts. No other known use of k-graphs exist to this day. k-graphs are studied solely for the purpose of creating C*-algebras from them.  Background  The finite graph theory in a directed graph form a mathematics category under concatenation called the free object category (which is generated by a graph). The length of a path in E gives a functor from this category into the natural numbers \\\\mathbb{N}. A k-graph is a natural generalisation of this concept which was introduced in 2000 by Alex Kumjian and David Pask.  Examples  * It can be shown that a 1-graph is precisely the path category of a directed graph. * The category T^k consisting of a single object and k commuting morphisms {f_1,...,f_k}, together with the map d:T^k\\\\to\\\\mathbb{N}^k defined d(f_1^{n_1}...f_k^{n_k})=(n_1 , \\\\ldots , n_k), is a k-graph. * Let \\\\Omega_k = \\\\\\\\{ (m,n) : m,n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^k , m \\\\le n \\\\\\\\} then \\\\Omega_k is a k-graph when gifted with the structure maps r(m,n)=(m,m), s(m,n)=(n,n), (m,n)(n,p)=(m,p) and d(m,n) = n-m.  Notation  The notation for k-graphs is borrowed extensively from the corresponding notation for categories: * For n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^k let \\\\Lambda^n = d^{-1} (n). * By the factorisation property it follows that \\\\Lambda^0 = \\\\operatorname{Obj} ( \\\\Lambda ). * For v,w \\\\in \\\\Lambda^0 and X \\\\subseteq \\\\Lambda we have v X = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda \\\\in X : r ( \\\\lambda ) = v \\\\\\\\}, X w = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda \\\\in X : s ( \\\\lambda ) = w \\\\\\\\} and v X w = v X \\\\cap X w. * If 0 < \\\\\\\\# v \\\\Lambda^n < \\\\infty for all v \\\\in \\\\Lambda^0 and n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^k then \\\\Lambda is said to be row-finite with no sources.  Visualisation - Skeletons  A k-graph is best visualised by drawing its 1-skeleton as a k-coloured graph E=(E^0,E^1,r,s,c) where E^0 = \\\\Lambda^0, E^1 = \\\\cup_{i=1}^k \\\\Lambda^{e_i}, r,s inherited from \\\\Lambda and c: E^1 \\\\to \\\\\\\\{ 1 , \\\\ldots , k \\\\\\\\} defined by c (e) = i if and only if e \\\\in \\\\Lambda^{e_i} where e_1 , \\\\ldots , e_n are the canonical generators for \\\\mathbb{N}^k. The factorisation property in \\\\Lambda for elements of degree e_i+e_j where i eq j gives rise to relations between the edges of E.  C*-algebra  As with graph-algebras one may associate a C*-algebra to a k-graph: Let \\\\Lambda be a row-finite k-graph with no sources then a Cuntz–Krieger \\\\Lambda family in a C*-algebra B is a collection \\\\\\\\{ s_\\\\lambda : \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\Lambda \\\\\\\\} of operators in B such that # s_\\\\lambda s_\\\\mu = s_{\\\\lambda \\\\mu} if \\\\lambda , \\\\mu , \\\\lambda \\\\mu \\\\in \\\\Lambda; # \\\\\\\\{ s_v : v \\\\in \\\\Lambda^0 \\\\\\\\} are mutually orthogonal projections; # if d ( \\\\mu ) = d ( u ) then s_\\\\mu^* s_ u = \\\\delta_{\\\\mu , u} s_{s ( \\\\mu )}; # s_v = \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda \\\\in v \\\\Lambda^n} s_\\\\lambda s_\\\\lambda^* for all n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^k and v \\\\in \\\\Lambda^0. C^* ( \\\\Lambda ) is then the universal C*-algebra generated by a Cuntz–Krieger \\\\Lambda-family.

The epicenter was located in the northern Izu Peninsula, Japan. It had a magnitude of 7.3. The earthquake was caused by the movement of the Tanna Fault (丹那断層).  Geology  The Izu Peninsula is located in the northern tip of the Philippine Sea Plate. However, the GPS vectors of the Izu Peninsula are almost westwards, which are different from the northwestward motion of the Philippine Sea Plate. A seismically active area in the east off the Izu Peninsula might be the deformation zone between the Izu Peninsula and the main part of the Philippine Sea Plate or at times be regarded as the boundary between the Izu microplate and the Philippine Sea Plate. The suspected boundary might be rather a complex fracture zone than a simple boundary. In this view, the Izu microplate is pushed northwestwards by the Philippine Sea Plate and rotates clockwise, pivoting on the base of the Izu Peninsula. The rotation causes an almost westward motion under the Suruga Bay. The interplate coupling under the Sugura Bay is not weak.\\"Interplate coupling in the Tokai District, Central Japan, deduced from continuous GPS data\\" by T. Sagiya The Tanna Fault is part of the North Izu Fault Zone (or Kita-Izu Fault Zone) (北伊豆断層帯). The North Izu Fault Zone is about long, lying in the NNE-SSW direction. This fault zone is predominantly of left-lateral strike-slip faulting with an estimated left-lateral slip rate of about per 1000 years.http://www.jishin.go.jp/main/chousa/katsudansou_pdf/38_kitaizu.pdf The 1930 North Izu earthquake was identified with the movement of the Tanna Fault. The focal mechanism was left-lateral strike-slip faulting.  Damage  272 people were reported dead in this earthquake. 2,165 houses were totally destroyed. Building damage rate was high along the Tanna Fault. Many buildings collapsed in the village of Kawanishi (川西村), now part of Izunokuni, Shizuoka. The earthquake caused many landslides. A landslide caused 15 deaths in the village of Nakakano (中狩野村), and another one caused 8 deaths in the village of Kitakano (北狩野村), both locations now belong to Izu, Shizuoka. The intensity reached shindo 6 in Mishima, Shizuoka. Fires were reported in Itō, Shizuoka.  Related earthquakes  The change of the Coulomb failure stress due to the 1923 Kantō earthquake may have had contribution to the occurrence of this earthquake. There was an earthquake swarm near Itō, Shizuoka from February 13 to the end of May, 1930, to which the November 26 earthquake was not thought to belong. The largest foreshock of this earthquake occurred on November 25, 1930, at 16:05 local time, and the largest aftershock occurred on March 7, 1931, at 01:53 local time.  Earthquake light  Prominent earthquake light was observed.http://www.seis.nagoya-u.ac.jp/EVENT/program_WS.pdf It could be observed over a large area, including the coast of Suruga Bay, the Izu Peninsula, the coast of Sagami Bay, Sagami River Valley, the coast of Tokyo Bay, and the Bōsō Peninsula.

The school is located in the city of Milan in a historical building. The motto of the school is Iterum alte volat, which means Flying high again. History The history of the school is diverse and complex. The building that currently hosts the school was built in the Middle Ages as the Hospital of Saint Celso. Later, in 1758 it became the Cistercian monastery of Saint Luke and was used as a military hospital first and then, at the hands of Pietro Teulié, as a military orphanage. With the advent of the Napoleonic Italian Kingdom, the orphanage's name was changed to Royal College of the Military Orphans. In 1839 the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I, converted the orphanage to the Imperial college of cadets. In 1848 the cadets took part in the Five Days of Milan, after which the building hosted the Royal school of artillery. With the return of the Austrians the school was not reopened to punish the insurgents of the Five Days of Milan and it was instead turned into a military hospital. The college will open in 1859 as the Military College of Milan and closed again in 1869 due to financial difficulties. The school, however, opens in 1873 thanks to the new Army regulations, approved that year, but in 1894 is forced to close again. During World War I the building is used as a military barrack but in 1935 the Fascist government founds the Military School of Milan which will close with the Badoglio Proclamation in 1943. In the following 53 years the building was used as headquarters of the III Corps of the Italian army, until 1996 when the school was reopened as a branch of the Nunziatella military school. The school became independent in 1998 and was first designated second military school of the Army and ultimately Military School \\"Teulié\\". Notable ex cadets thumb H.R.H.

Academy lifestyle Since the military school \\"Teulié\\" is essentially a military barrack, like every other military academy it has a strict code of behaviour that has to be followed. If the cadets have not been punished for breaking the code of behaviour, they are allowed to go out for half a day on Wednesday and Saturday, and for the whole day on Sunday, at the times defined by the company commander. Furthermore, if the conditions persist, the cadets are allowed to sleep outside of the school on Saturday night.

Gladstone was M.P. for the University of Oxford at the time of publication, but had been trained as a classicist.  Colour controversy  The section of the book which has received the most mainstream attention is Gladstone's analysis of Homeric language related to colours. Gladstone raises the issue that the colours Homer attributed to many natural objects feel strange to modern readers. For example, Homer applies the adjective porphyreos, which in later Greek roughly means \\"purple\\" or \\"dark red,\\" to describe blood, a dark cloud, a wave, and a rainbow, and he uses the epithet oinops (\\"wine-looking\\") to refer to the sea. Gladstone explained this by suggesting that the ancient Greeks categorized colours mainly in terms of light/dark contrasts, rather than in terms of hue. Many readers, however, have read Gladstone's explanation of Homer's colour terms as a suggestion that he and the other ancient Greeks were colourblind. The most controversial line is his claim that \\"the organ of colour and its impressions were but partially developed among the Greeks of the heroic age.\\" Gladstone denied that he suggested here the Greeks suffered from colourblindness, though, and he later said: \\"My meaning was substantially this: that he [Homer] operated, in the main, upon a quantitative scale, with white and black, or light and dark, for its opposite extremities, instead of the qualitative scale opened by the diversities of colour.\\" Later linguistic research indicates that the Greek language probably did not have a word for the color blue at that time. Color names often developed individually, beginning with black and white, and then red, and only much later adding the color blue, probably when the pigment could be manufactured reliably.

The letter G refers to ganglioside, and M is for monosialic acid as it has one sialic acid only. The numbering is based on its relative mobility in electrophoresis among other monosialic gangliosides. Its structure can be condensed to NANA-Gal-Glc-ceramide. GM3 is the most common membrane-bound glycosphingolipid in tissues, composed of three monosaccharide groups attached to a ceramide backbone. GM3 serves as a precursor for other, more complex gangliosides. Like other gangliosides, GM3 is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus. It is then transported to the plasma membrane, where it functions in cellular signaling. GM3 also functions as an inhibitor; it inhibits cell growth, the function of growth factor receptors, and generation of cytokines by T cells.  Applications in Cancer Treatment  The immunologic function of GM3 in inhibiting proliferation has resulted in its usage in the study of cancer biology and cancer treatments. GM3 has been found to reduce the motility of ovarian cancer cells, colorectal cancer cells, and gastric cancer cells. High amounts of GM3 also displayed a high amount of caveolin-1, a molecule which has been shown to inhibit ovarian cancer growth. In bladder cancer cells, GM3 show antiproliferative effects. Increased concentrations of GM3 in bladder cancer cells reduces the malignancy potential of those cells and induces apoptosis. The addition of GM3 to bladder cancer cells also decreases their cell adhesion and inhibits tumor growth. Due to its role in inhibiting cancer growth, GM3 is a target of cancer treatments. The chemotherapy drug cisplatin functions by inducing GM3-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells.

Marques served as the President of the Principality of Asturias from 1995 to 1999. He is the only member of the People's Party (PP) to have held the presidency of Asturias to date. In 1999, Marques founded Unión Renovadora Asturiana (URAS), a regional political party based in Asturias. Biography=Personal life and career Marqués was born on 4 August 1946. He graduated from the University of Oviedo in 1967. He became a lawyer, practicing at firms in Gijón and Oviedo during the 1970s. He also became the director of a metal company from 1973 to 1979. He then moved to Puerto Rico, where he lived from 1979 to 1983. He moved back to Spain in 1983 to become the commercial director of the firm, Isidro Jover y Compañía, in Barcelona. Marques was involved with People's Party (PP) from the time of the party's establishment in 1977. he was appointed to the PP regional executive committee in 1987 and was elected to the General Council of the Principality of Asturias that same year. He became the chairman of the PP's finance committee in Asturias in 1991. He further became the spokesman of the People's Party in 1993. He elected the Vice President of Asturias at the autonomous community's tenth regional congress in September 1993. President of Asturias In the May 1995 Asturias General Council election, the PP under Marqués won 21 of the 45 seats in the General Council. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) won 17 seats, while the United Left and Partido Asturianista won a combined six seats. The PSOE failed to form a coalition government with the smaller parties due to disagreements. Therefore, Marqués formed the new PP government with a simple majority in the council. He was sworn in as president on 11 July 1995. The regional Asturian PP party became plagued by infighting by 1998. Marqués came under attack by members of the PP, both nationally and within Asturias. Oviedo Mayor Gabino de Lorenzo, a member of the PP, accused Marqués of ignoring both the party and the needs of the city. The First Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, Francisco Álvarez-Cascos, was also condemned Marqués for lack of coordination with the party. A wave of resignations from Marqués' government followed the PP's withdrawal of confidence. The first resignation was Pedro Muñiz, the regional director of sports and youth. The Asturias General Council rejected a censure motion against Marqués on 10 March 1999, which had been introduced by members of the PP. Despite the opposition from members of the PP, Marqués finished his entire term as President with the support of only four members of the General Council. Post-presidency Marqués's ongoing dispute and crisis with the PP led him to found the Asturian Renewal Union (URAS) in December 1998. The URAS, now under Marques, won three seats in June 1999, Asturias General Council election while the PP won 15 seats, down from 21 in 1995. However, the PSOE won a clear majority of 24 seats in the election. Marqués retained his seat in the 1999 election, under the banner of the new URAS, serving in the council until 2003. Marques ran again in the May 2003 election, but the URAS failed to win seats in the General Council. He remained President of the Asturian Renewal Union until November 2007.

It included a CRT amber screen with a wide aspect ratio (i.e. more than 4:3), a black and white thermal transfer printer, a 3.5\\" floppy drive for saving documents, and dedicated computing hardware, all enclosed in a single case. The keyboard was separate and a custom design whose unusual features included a style key and not just an undo key but also a do key.http://computermuseum.50megs.com/images/collection/philips-videowriter.jpg The VideoWRITER was not a freely programmable computer but a typewriter replacement appliance. It was not a lap-top machine but was designed to be transportable in either a cloth or hard plastic carry case accessory. History Blindness (published 1995) and The Gospel According to Jesus Christ (published 1991) were written using it. First released in 1985, the VideoWRITER was sold with a moderate degree of success for several years, with worldwide sales in the mid-hundreds-of-thousands. Notable users included Portuguese Nobel Prize Winner José Saramago and American poet Lucille Clifton. Some units were primarily Magnavox-branded and some were just Philips-branded, and there were several models. With the VideoWriter, Magnavox/Philips competed with Coleco, Brother, Smith-Corona and Canon, all of which offered similar inexpensive dedicated word processors. The VideoWRITER appeared in the movies 52 Pickup, Broadcast News, and repeatedly in Licence to Kill. The VideoWRITER became the principal product of the Philips/Magnavox division, \\"Philips Home Interactive Systems\\" (PHIS), after management decided to discontinue all development of video game consoles and home PCs (even though in 1984, the Magnavox Odyssey held 55% of worldwide console market share). This system was intended to bring $10,000 professional word processors to consumers, targeting high school and college students in particular. While in design, it was nicknamed the PWP, or the \\"Little Orange\\" (as the local University of Tennessee sports nickname was \\"Big Orange\\"), but this was dropped when Coleco started using the name PWP. The 100+ column amber screen was selected for the very best in readability, along with extra space for on-screen help to the right of the typing area. Similarly, the keyboard was designed with quality ease of typing in mind in all aspects. After the original version was released in 1985, it was localized to and sold in 11 European countries, although the character set originally included support for Spanish. About a dozen software engineers from the Magnavox Odyssey video game console group (which became PHIS) worked on the product; overall, PHIS at this time employed over 70. Not only were there follow-up models, but also a sheet feeder accessory was released for the VideoWRITER. Although never released, an accessory, named the VideoWRITER Smart Keyboard, was well under design at the time of PHIS's shut- down in 1988, principally by Greg Weinstein. The Smart Keyboard was to be roughly 8-1/2 by 11 inches, one inch thick, with a flip-open and adjustable 8-row by 80-column display, a full keyboard, and special function keys. It included the ability to hold over 20 pages of typing, and would have provided a calculator, multi-alarm clock, calculator, and several other convenience functions. When connected to the VideoWRITER itself through the RJ-14 keyboard connector, documents could be uploaded to the VideoWRITER's floppy disk and printed. The hardware chassis was from Kyocera, and was essentially the same as the RadioShack TRS-100 portable computer. Recognizing that the ink cartridges and the special VideoWRITER floppies (which included a dictionary) were ephemeral, the application designed included the ability for the VideoWRITER to recognize blank 3-1/2 floppies and format them for VideoWRITER use (although without the dictionary feature). Also, the non-reusable thermal transfer ink cartridge can be removed from the printer mechanism, in which case the VideoWRITER will print to standard thermal paper sheets, thus allowing the system to be used up to the current day. Although the VideoWRITER has the capability to accept program disks, none were ever sold, although game designer Bob Harris designed several entertaining apps, such as an acrostic solver. The groups that became PHIS included the Philips division that invented laser disc technology and designed the first laser video disc player (Bob Gepp was the project manager of this effort). After specifying along with partner Sony the fundamental specs for CD music and CD-ROM (the so-called Red, Yellow, and Green Books), the storage area was split off into Philips LMS (Laser/Magnetic Storage), which eventually moved from the PHIS office location to Colorado, forming the nucleus of what would become the storage products industry there. Meanwhile, the Odyssey group had finished designing the next generation Odyssey console as well as the C9000 personal computer system, which would have been the first CD-ROM-based and GUI-based Unix-family system in the personal computer industry. According to PHIS president Lou Arpino, referring to game consoles and PCs: \\"It's just a Cabbage-Patch Doll phenomenon\\"—and thus dropping all products except the VideoWRITER. Design Based on a 1984 motherboard design by PHIS engineer Dan Murphy, that was elegantly simple and able to be manufactured for $25, the VideoWRITER used the Hitachi HD64180 cpu, a clone of the Zilog z80 with a unique pinout, along with a video controller from NCR. The system included 16K RAM, 64K ROM, a 3-1/2\\" floppy disk drive (the second system to use one after the Macintosh), and an integral thermal transfer dot matrix printer. While designed originally to sell for $399, parts were sourced in Europe and Asia that were greatly affected by the inflation that plagued this period in time, and thus it ended up selling in the U.S. for $799 (still a bargain compared to the IBM PC at $1500 or Mac at $2500). The industrial design for the exterior was created by Duncan Copeland, a Philips designer from Europe assigned to the PHIS operation in Knoxville, Tennessee. The application and thus keyboard layout was designed by Greg L. Weinstein, inspired by the Ashton-Tate Multimate Advantage software for the IBM PC. Project Manager was Robert S. (Bob) Gepp, lead software engineer was Rexford A. (Rex) Battenberg, and lead developer of the custom operating system was Nicholas (Nick) Vigorito. It was manufactured at the Philips factory in Vienna, originally at the rate of 11 systems/hour, although some of the inventory was remanufactured at the master Magnavox North American warehouse in Jefferson City, Tennessee (an hour away from the PHIS offices).

Karl E. Weick maintains that research in the field of social psychology can – at any one time – achieve only two of the three meta-theoretical virtues of \\"Generality\\", \\"Accuracy\\" and \\"Simplicity.\\" One of these aspects therefore must always be subordinated to the others. The postulate is named for the Canadian social psychologist Warren Thorngate of the University of Alberta, whose work is quoted by Weick. Thorngate described the problem this way:  Background  The postulate was a response to the debate among sociologists – mainly between Kenneth J. Gergen and Barry R. Schlenker – revolving around the meaning of sociological research. Whilst Schlenker appeared to maintain the position, that context only superficially influenced social behavior, Gergen appeared to maintain that context penetrated everything in social behavior, rendering observations as specific to the very situation observed. Thus, simplifying the discussion, the observation of social behavior would be no more than collecting historical data, since context would never be the same and the results would remain unique. In fact, sociology would be some specialized kind of historical research. Considering this, Thorngate writes The statement was confirmed by Gergen:  Weick's Interpretation  Weick represents this model “as a clockface with general at 12:00, accurate at 4:00, and simple at 8:00 to drive home the point that an explanation that satisfies any two characteristics is least able to satisfy the third characteristic.” According to Weick, research operates in this continuum: * if research that aims to be accurate and simple (6-o'clock), results would not be generally applicable. * if research that aims to be general and simple (10-o'clock), results would not be accurate and * if research that aims to be general and accurate (2-o'clock), results would not be simple any more. Basically, Weick maintains, that there is a \\"trade- off\\" between these three virtues in such a way that only two can be achieved at any given time. Research therefore must operate in different modes to capture reality in sufficient precision and granularity. The postulate therefore becomes descriptive of research and prescriptive of research methodology.  Criticism  Though confirming the postulate in general, Fred Dickinson, Carol Blair and Brian L. Ott criticized Weicks use of the word \\"accurate\\". Accuracy is hard to achieve, especially if the topic is difficult to qualify, e. g. in researching memory. They suggest replacing the term \\"accurate\\" with \\"interpretive utility\\".  Sources  Fred Dickinson, Carol Blair, Brian L.

He was the first chair of the physics department at the University of California, Irvine, and later served as president of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (New Mexico Tech) and as Executive Director and CEO of the American Institute of Physics. Biography Ford was born on May 1, 1926 in West Palm Beach, Florida, to parents Paul Hammond Ford (1892-1961) and Edith Timblin Ford (1892-1992) and was the second of their three children. He spent most of his childhood in Kentucky, living one year in Georgia when he was eight and nine. Education Ford attended Highlands High School in Fort Thomas, Kentucky from 1940 to 1942, then Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, NH, graduating in 1944. In 1948, he received an A.B. from Harvard University, graduating summa cum laude. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 1953, studying under John Archibald Wheeler. During 1950-1952 he interrupted his graduate studies to join the H-bomb design team at Los Alamos National Laboratory (then Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory) and at Princeton University's Project Matterhorn. US Navy In April 1944, just before his 18th birthday, while still at Exeter, Ford enlisted in the US Navy. After summer employment at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, Ford was called to active service and began the Navy's Electronic Technician Training. In June 1945, he transferred into the V-12 Navy College Training Program, studying at John Carroll University in Cleveland, Ohio, and at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. In three four-month semesters completed in one year, he was able to secure credit for two years of college work and entered Harvard University as a junior in the fall of 1946 following his discharge from the Navy in June of that year.Interview of Kenneth W. Ford by Alexei Kojevnikov on November 15, 1997, Niels Bohr Library & Archives, American Institute of Physics, College Park, MD USA Graduate Work and the H-Bomb In the fall of 1948, Ford began graduate studies in physics at Princeton University. In 1950, he took a leave of absence from graduate work to work on the H-bomb at Los Alamos National Laboratory (then called the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory) with his mentor John Wheeler. Others in Wheeler's immediate group were John Toll and Burton Freeman. They worked closely with other lab staff members such as Carson Mark, Conrad Longmire, Edward Teller, and Stanislaw Ulam, and with lab consultants such as John von Neumann, Enrico Fermi, and Hans Bethe. Following the radiation implosion idea offered by Teller and Ulam early in 1951, the focus of the work was on this new design idea. In June 1951, Ford returned to Princeton to continue the H-bomb work there at Wheeler's Project Matterhorn. Much of Ford's work was concerned with writing programs and doing calculations related to thermonuclear burning, first using human \\"computers\\" with desk calculators, then IBM card-programmed calculators (CPCs), and later, with Project Matterhorn, the SEAC computer at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, DC. A SEAC calculation, programmed by Ford with the assistance of John Toll and the guidance of John Wheeler, provided the final predicted yield of 7 megatons for the Mike test on November 1, 1952. The actual yield was approximately 10 megatons. > \\"I was aware of the fact that Oppenheimer was expressing opposition to the > development of the H-bomb, for various reasons, from technical to moral. But > I was also an accidental participant in what may have been the critical > moment in changing his point of view. In June of '51 there was a meeting of > the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission [actually a > broader gathering that included the GAC] meeting at the Institute for > Advanced Study. They were meeting in a first floor room on, if I remember > correctly, a Sunday morning. Maybe it was a Saturday morning. It was a > weekend. [It was Sunday, June 17.] Wheeler was scheduled to make a > presentation on the latest results of our calculations on the CPC in New > York. I was working every night, all night, that week prior to that meeting > trying to get the latest and best results that we could. > \\"The night prior to this meeting at the Institute for Advanced Study, I took > a morning train down from New York with the latest results, went over to the > Matterhorn building, got out a very large piece of paper, maybe about two > feet by three feet in size, a large rectangle of paper, and sketched out a > graph showing our latest calculation of thermonuclear burning, still very > crude of course, because of those calculations, yet extremely encouraging. I > then rolled up this large graph and drove over to the Institute and walked > up to the first-floor window of the room where the meeting was in progress > and either rapped gently on the window or signaled through the window to > catch Wheeler's attention. As it happened, Wheeler had just taken the floor. > It had just become his turn to speak. He interrupted his speech, walked over > to the window, opened it, took from me this large graph, carried it back and > pasted it on the blackboard for all to see. And then, at that moment, > according to the reports of those who were there, Oppenheimer suddenly > decided, 'This does look encouraging. I think they've really got something. > It looks like it's going to work after all.'\\" In the fall of 1952, Ford left project Matterhorn and spent the next six months completing his graduate dissertation on the collective model of the nucleus. After defending his dissertation in the spring of 1953, and after spending that summer working in Los Alamos, he took up a post-doctoral research appointment at Indiana University, beginning that fall. Ford furthered his professional education in two subsequent leaves of absence: in 1955-56 at the Max Planck Institut in Göttingen, Germany, mentored by Werner Heisenberg and supported by a Fulbright Fellowship; and in 1961-62 at Imperial College, London and MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, mentored by Abdus Salam, Herman Feshbach, and Victor Weisskopf and supported by a National Science Foundation Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship. It was during this second leave that Ford wrote his first book, The World of Elementary Particles. In 1964, Ford took a job as professor and department chair at the newly opened University of California, Irvine, setting up the Physics Department there for its opening in the fall of 1965. Cessation of weapons work In the summer of 1968, influenced by his opposition to the Vietnam War, Ford announced at a talk in Cloudcroft, NM that he would no longer do weapons work or other secret work.http://www.spsnational.org/governance/ethics/ford.pdf Research, teaching, administration, and writing Ford's principal research was in the theory of nuclear structure, with some work in particle and mathematical physics. He exploited the nuclear shell model and the collective, or unified, model, and also worked extensively on muonic atoms. His first paper, co- authored with David Bohm in 1950, used data from low-energy neutron scattering to give evidence for the transparency of nuclei to neutrons. A 1953 paper showed how regularities in the energies of the first excited states of even- even nuclei can be interpreted in terms of the deformations of these nuclei. Later papers analyzed muonic-atom data to give evidence on the distribution of electric charge within nuclei. Ford's 1959 papers with John Wheeler provided a semiclassical theory of scattering. In 1963, he participated, with Henry Kolm and Eiichi Goto, in a search for magnetic monopoles. Although Ford's initial appointment at Indiana University in 1953 was as a postdoctoral researcher, he was given the opportunity to teach a graduate course. In later appointments at Indiana and other universities, he continued to teach both graduate students and undergraduate. Subsequent to retirement, he taught high-school physics at Germantown Academy (1995–98) and at Germantown Friends School (2000-2001). In 1958, after a year's leave from Indiana University in Los Alamos, Ford took up new faculty duties at Brandeis University, where he continued research, supervision of graduate students, and, for the first time, taught introductory physics. He also served as department chair at Brandeis, 1963-64. In 1964 he was recruited by the soon-to-open new campus of the University of California at Irvine as its first physics chair. In 1970, for family reasons, Ford left Irvine for the University of Massachusetts Boston, where he was a professor. In 1975, he accepted the job of President of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NM Tech). He spent 7 years at New Mexico Tech, resigning after receiving a vote of no confidence from the faculty. Ford then became Executive Vice President of the University of Maryland System. That job lasted for slightly more than a year, during 1982-83, before Ford took his first non-academic job as president of Molecular Biophysics Technology in Philadelphia.Interview of Kenneth W. Ford by Alexei Kojevnikov on November 22, 1997, Niels Bohr Library & Archives, American Institute of Physics, College Park, MD USA When Molecular Physics of Technology's research results failed to measure up to expectations and the company had to shut down, Ford took a position as education officer of the American Physical Society. Then, in 1987, he became the director of the American Institute of Physics and later helped to shepherd its move from New York City (to which he'd been commuting from Philadelphia) to College Park, MD. Ford's retirement from the institute in 1993, at age 67, coincided with its move to College Park, along with other physics organizations. Ford has written ten books (counting one three-volume work as three books), one of them with a co-author—five before his retirement and five after. His first book, The World of Elementary Particles, written in 1961-62 and published in 1963, did well enough and was satisfying enough to encourage him to write more. The thick textbook Basic Physics followed in 1968 and the three volumes of Classical and Modern Physics in 1972-74. Following his retirement and while teaching at Germantown Academy, he joined with John Wheeler to write Wheeler's autobiography, Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam, published in 1998. In 1999, this book won an American Institute of Physics Science Writing Prize. There followed The Quantum World in 2004, In Love with Flying (a memoir) in 2007, 101 Quantum Questions in 2011, and Building the H Bomb in 2015. Basic Physics was reissued in 2017, repurposed as a resource for teachers. Post-retirement Since officially retiring, Ford has done some consulting work, worked for the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, tutored students, both in person and online, taught high-school physics, and, as noted above, written five books. He lives with his wife Joanne outside Philadelphia. Personal Ford married Karin Stehnike on August 27, 1953 and fathered two children; Paul Thomas Ford (1957) and Sarah Elizabeth Ford (1958). They divorced in 1961. Ford married Joanne Baumunk on June 9, 1962, gained one stepdaughter, Nina Tannenwald (1959), and fathered four more children: Caroline Amanda Ford (now Caroline Richards) (1963), Adam Baumunk Ford (1964), Jason Lawrence Ford (1966), and Lucas Wheeler (now Star Lucia) Ford (1968).

She decided many crucial cases. During the politically turbulent years of the Democrat Party administration (1950–1960) in Turkey, she was forced to retire from her post because of her steadfast refusal to bend the principles of law to serve the political party in power. She successfully challenged her forced retirement in court, and was reinstated to the appellant bench in 1963 with full honors and compensation. Judge Ruacan was a fearless advocate of the principles of the law and was also an untiring defender of women's rights, following Atatürk’s Kemalist ideology throughout her life. She died of a heart attack in Ankara, Turkey, in 1974.

Mathew was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, the fourth child (and eldest son) of Alexander Mathew, a factory overseer, and his wife Jean, née Mortimer. Mathew was initially educated at Kidd's school, Aberdeen, at nine years of age his father died and went to live with his maternal grandmother at Insch then at the Insch Free Church School where he was a pupil-teacher from 1862 to 1864. Mathew migrated to Queensland, Australia, with a brother and sister in 1864 to live with their uncle John Mortimer on his station, Manumbar, on the Burnett River. Mathew worked there for six years as a Stockrider, bookkeeper, and storeman becoming familiar with the culture and language of the Kabi and Wakawaka (see List of Indigenous Australian group names#W people. Mathew then tried gold-digging for two years and then worked as a teacher at Dalby, Queensland (1872–75) and the Brisbane Normal School (1875–76). Then he moved to Victoria, Australia and graduated from the University of Melbourne (B.A., 1884; M.A., 1886) with first-class honours despite working at times as a tutor and station-manager. As a Presbyterian minister, Mathew worked at Ballan, Victoria from 1887 for two years, then at Coburg, Victoria from 1889 to 1923. In 1889 Mathew won the prize and medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales for an essay titled 'The Australian Aborigines'. This was the basis for his best-known publication, Eaglehawk and Crow (1899). This publication was criticized (as Mathew had expected) by the ethnographers Walter Baldwin Spencer, Alfred William Howitt and Lorimer Fison. There was however, more support from Daisy Bates and Robert Hamilton Mathews. Mathew returned to Queensland in 1906, visiting the Kabi and Wakawaka people at the Barambah Government Aboriginal Station. He published Two Representative Tribes of Queensland (1910) and although his linguistic studies and ethnographic reporting are still well regarded, his controversial theory of a tri-hybrid origin of Australian Aborigines is not supported by current data.

The significance of axiophytes is from their strong association with habitats considered to be of high merit for conservation. Axiophytes are a relatively recent concept which has its roots in such ideas as \\"ancient woodland indicator species\\". According to the BSBI around 40% of plant species can be considered axiophytes.http://www.bsbi.org.uk/axiophytes.html Very rare species are not considered axiophytes; for a species to be a useful indicator of quality habitat it must be relatively frequent in those habitats, but scarce elsewhere. A typical example would be dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), a plant slow to colonise new sites, but common in ancient woodland and old hedgerows. The number of axiophytes on a site provides a crude, but convenient, measure of its nature conservation importance. It is a particularly useful approach when comparing otherwise similar sites. Over time axiophyte numbers can be used for monitoring. They have been used as a metric for evaluating the ecological value of areas at a landscape scale and in setting strategic conservation prioritieshttp://www.bsbi.org.uk/Nsl17p13.pdf Axiophytes in the Meres & Mosses The BSBI gives the following criteria for axiophytes * 90% restricted to these conservation habitats; * Recorded in fewer than 25% of tetrads in the county.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Harwich, the archdeaconry of Colchester, and the diocese of Chelmsford. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The oldest fabric in the church is in the south wall of the nave, dating from 1200 or earlier. The chancel, the south porch and the first tower were built in 1340. The tower was rebuilt in the 16th century, and again in the following century. In 1826 the north wall of the nave and the north aisle were added. In 1853, when the rector was Revd Charles Merivale (later the Dean of Ely), the interior of the chancel was restored by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley. The nave was restored in 1864, followed by the chancel walls in 1887. In 1944 the east window was damaged by a bomb. In 1991 an extension was made to the north of the church to house a vestry and meeting rooms, and in 2009 the roof and tower were repaired and parts of the interior of the church were modernised. Architecture The church is constructed in flint, septaria and brick, with limestone dressings and a tiled roof. The plan consists of a three-bay nave with a south porch, a north aisle, a chancel, a north vestry, and a west tower with a stair turret on the southeast. In the chancel are a 14th-century piscina and a triple sedilia. The octagonal pulpit dates from about 1906. In 1906 a two-manual pipe organ made by Norman and Beard was installed. This was replaced by an electronic organ made by Copeman Hart in 2005. There is a ring of three bells, dated 1667, 1714, and 1907. External features The churchyard contains the graves of the war poet Robert Nichols and his father John Bowyer Buchanan Nichols, also a poet. The grave of the Canadian politician John Robertson also lies in the churchyard, as do the war graves of a soldier and two airmen of the Second World War.

Report on the Colibri world premiere; accessed on March 26th 2013 Body According to the manufacturer, it will be the first vehicle in its class (L7e) to successfully pass the Euro NCAP crash test – despite the low curb weight of 440 kg / 970 lbs including the battery. With the comparatively low-capacity battery holding 6.5 kWhrs of electric energy, ranges of up to 110 kilometers / 68 miles per charge can be achieved, as well as short recharging time of two hours on a 220 V household socket or less than twenty minutes to 80% capacity on a fast charging station. In addition, the Colibri will offer a fully enclosed cab and hence be weatherproof, unlike its already available competitor, the Renault Twizy.

The church is across the street from the Medieval Palazzo Maffei-Guarnacci (Casa Torre Toscano). History While there is documentation dating a church on the site to the 10th century, the Romanesque facade of the church, partially embellished with marble and pietra dura striations dates to around 1285. In the arches are reliefs with the heraldic symbols of the Farnese family. The statue of the Madonna over the portal is a copy of a 14th-century original now in the Museum of Sacred Art. Those expecting the interior will continue in the style of the exterior will be disappointed. The interior was completely modified in the 1820s by the order of the Scolopi, which had owned the church since 1711. The presbytery still contains a marble tabarnacle by a 15th- century Florentine Balsimelli di Settignano, and contains a Madonna and child terracotta by Giovanni della Robbia and a wood panel of The Guardian Angel by Nicolò Circignani. Along the nave are altars with paintings including a canvas depicting the Holy Family by Carlo Maratta and a Madonna of the Redemption, which is a 15th-century fresco transferred to canvas attributed to Cenni di Francesco (Cenni di Francesco di ser Cenni). There is also a painting of San Giuseppe Calasanzio by Giuseppe Zocchi. In the oratory of Saint Christopher there is a fresco of the Madonna and child attributed to Vincenzo Tamagni.

It is capable of selectable split uplink for SNG, tailored for increased communications demands such as DTH and Internet. Satellite *Increased power – IS-901 is designed to provide up to 5 dB for downlink EIRP, and up to 1.8 dB for G/T over the IS-VII satellites. *Increased Capacity – With over 72 C-band 36 MHz equivalent unit transponders, IS-901 provides a significant increase in capacity over the previous satellite at 342°E. *Improved Coverage – IS-901 provides significantly expanded zone coverage. The Ku-band spot beams also include more areas within each zone. Intelsat 901 was launched by an Ariane 4 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana on 9 June 2001 at 3:45 local time (6:45 GMT). Encounter with Russian Olymp satellite On 9 October 2015, SpaceNews reported that in April 2015, the Russian satellite Olymp-K had moved to within of Intelsat 901 and the nearby Intelsat 7, causing concerns of a safety-of-flight incident. Attempts by Intelsat to contact the Russian satellite operators were unsuccessful and no reason for the satellite's movement was given by the Russian government. The move sparked classified meetings within the Department of Defense and heightened suspicions that Olymp-K satellite was performing signals intelligence, or was possibly an anti-satellite weapon. Mission Extension Vehicle-1 On 9 October 2019, Mission Extension Vehicle-1 (MEV-1) launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Proton-M rocket. Its mission is to dock with Intelsat 901 and extend its operational lifespan by performing station-keeping for the aging satellite. Before the docking of MEV-1 and Intelsat 901, ground controllers transitioned customers off of Intelsat 901 and moved the satellite to a graveyard orbit in December 2019 so that Eutelsat 5 West B, which launched with MEV-1, could use its orbital slot. Docking occurred on 25 February 2020 at 07:15 UTC. MEV-1 rendezvoused with Intelsat 901, reached out with mechanical fingers, and grabbed the target craft using its liquid propellant engine as a grapple point to pull the two satellites together. Over the next two months, Northrop Grumman and satellite prime contractor Space Systems/Loral performed tests on the satellites' systems before using MEV-1 to lower Intelsat 901 back to the geosynchronous arc to the 27.5° West (332.5° East) orbital slot, where it will remain for five years. On 17 April 2020, Intelsat and Northrop Grumman announced that Intelsat 901 had officially returned to operational service on 2 April 2020 at its new orbital slot. The satellite replaces Intelsat 907, a 17-year-old satellite now four years past its design life. After five years, MEV-1 will move Intelsat 901 back to a final graveyard orbit and release it before moving to another potential client.https://spacenews.com/intelsat-901-satellite-with- mev-1-servicer-attached-resumes-service/ Specifications * Total Transponders: Ku-Band up to 22 (in equiv. 36 MHz units) * Polarization: Ku- Band Linear - Horizontal or Vertical * Uplink Frequency: Ku-Band 14.00 to 14.50 GHz * Downlink Frequency: Ku-Band 10.95 to 11.20 GHz and 11.45 to 11.70 GHz * G/T (Ku-Band) (Beam Peak): Spot 1: up to +9.0 dB/K, Spot 2: up to +9.0 dB/K * SFD Range (Beam Edge): Ku-Band -87.0 to -69.0 dBW/m² ReferencesExternal links * Intelsat 901 Intelsat satellites Spacecraft launched in 2001 Satellites using the SSL 1300 bus ","title":"Intelsat 901"},{"id":"36005595","text":"Augusta Louise Schultz Hobart (July 28, 1871 – September 30, 1925) was an American female tennis player who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The town is located north of the Ülken Borsyk Desert, close to Lake Shalkar. Population: History Shalkar (Chelkar) was founded in 1870 as a settlement. At the time, Chelkar was a part of Irgizsky Uyezd of Turgay Oblast and was connected to Yrgyz by a road. In the 1900s, the railroad connecting Orenburg and Tashkent was built. Chelkar became an important railway station. Between 1905 and 1907 the station building, the locomotive depot, as well as other facilities including a school and a hospital, were built. In 1918, Chelkar was an area of battles during the Russian Civil War. In 1920, Turgay Oblast was transformed to Turgay Governorate, and in 1921, it was abolished and included into Orenburg-Turgay Governorate. On May 26, 1921 Irgizsky District, a successor of Irgizsky Uyezd, was transferred to Aktyubinsk Governorate of Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. On July 5, 1922 the district was abolished, and Shalkar became the administrative center of Chelkarsky Uyezd. In 1925, the republic was renamed Kazak Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic. On January 17, 1928 the governorate was abolished, and Chelkar was transferred to Aktyubinsk Okrug. The uyezds were abolished as well, and Chelkarsky Raion (District) was established. In 1928, Shalkar was granted a town status. On December 17, 1930 the okrug was abolished, and the districts became directly subordinate to the republic. In 1932, Aktobe Region was established, and in 1936, the republic was transformed into Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. In the 1930s Shalkar became a place for political exile, in particular, from Saint Petersburg. Economy=Industry Shalkar is mostly serving the railway; there is a carriage repair plant. There are also food industry enterprises. Transportation Shalkar is a railway station on the Trans-Aral Railway, which connects Orenburg and Tashkent. A branch line connects to Beyneu, from where trains can continue to various destinations, including the Caspian Sea port of Aktau. It is also connected to Irgiz by a road.

As Chairman of the NRC, Macfarlane prioritized the geological and operational lessons learned from the North Anna and Fukushima incidents, as well as improving the NRC's communication with public stakeholders and paying more attention to the back end of the fuel cycle in an era when more U.S. nuclear power plants were being decommissioned than built. She also pushed to make the NRC a more family-friendly workplace. Given that she had raised questions a decade earlier about the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for long-term geologic disposal of high-level nuclear waste, supporters of Yucca Mountain expected her to stall NRC licensing of Yucca Mountain, but she complied with a court order that ruled her predecessor's actions illegal and directed the NRC to continue its licensing review until it had spent down the funds made available for this purpose by Congress. After leaving the NRC, Macfarlane became the Director of the Institute for International Science and Technology Policy and a Professor of science policy and international affairs at Elliott School of International Affairs at the George Washington UniversityDixon, Darius, \\"NRC's Macfarlane to depart\\", Politico, October 21, 2014.

Model  The relation of the central table to those in dimension tables is one-to-many, or in some cases many-to-many rather than many-to-one; the primary keys of the central table are the foreign keys in dimension tables, and the main tables are, in general, smaller than the dimension tables. Main table columns are typically the source of query constraints, as opposed to dimension tables in the classical star schema. By starting queries with the smaller table, many results are filtered out early in the querying process, thereby streamlining the entire search path. To add further flexibility, more than one main table is allowed, with main and submain tables having a one-to-many relation. Each main table can have its own dimension tables.

Operating on LOX/RP-1 the engine was throttleable and had a thrust of at a chamber pressure of , making it one of the most powerful engines ever constructed. History The TR-107 was built by TRW following the successful conclusion of the development program for the TR-106 engine, a similar throttleable engine of about half the thrust burning LOX/LH2 instead of LOX / RP-1. Tom Mueller, then VP of Propulsion Development at Northrop, was project manager for both the TR-106 and TR-107 engines. In 2002, Mueller co-founded SpaceX with Elon Musk and became the VP of propulsion after cancellation of SLI program. Design The engine used duct-cooling of the main combustion chamber and materials that would not interact with kerosene to minimize coking. The duct separated the fuel from the chamber wall and allowed controlled cooling of the chamber to keep the temperature of the kerosene down. This approach simplified the engine in comparison with competing designs. By eliminating the regenerative cooling circuit, many large manifolds and associated plumbing were eliminated as well, reducing potential failure modes and improving engine reliability. The TR107 engine used oxygen-rich combustion (ORSC) products to alleviate soot build-up when running the turbo pumps. The goal of the development was to produce a large, low-cost, easy-to-manufacture booster engine. Status Northrop Grumman development of the TR-107 engine permitted consideration for potential use on next-generation launch and space transportation system.

(TTR) is an American political advocacy group that is active in the state of Tennessee. Its primary purpose is to monitor and influence issues of taxation but it also expresses opinions on issues such as government transparency and net neutrality. In 2005 an Associated Press story referred to the organization as a \\"leading anti-tax group\\". The organization describes itself as a grassroots effort and a non-partisan group and as a \\"support group for the tax groups around the state.\\" It was incorporated as a public benefit corporation of Tennessee on October 22, 2001. Donation pages on its site note that donations to TTR are not tax-deductible. In nearly all appearances in the media and speaking engagements, TTR is represented by its spokesman, Nashville real estate investor Ben Cunningham, who is also listed as a founder of the organization. Cunningham was also the lead founder of the Nashville Tea Party in 2011 saying, \\"There are also some projects that just don’t naturally fit into the Tennessee Tax Revolt sphere that we’re going to be involved with.\\" Many letters to members of Congress and other national or international bodies are signed by the organization's president Rick Durham. History In his book Covenant of Liberty: The Ideological Origins of the Tea Party Movement conservative activist and author Michael Patrick Leahy describes an event that he calls the Tennessee Tax Revolt which he credits as the genesis of the organization of the same name. This was a three-year popular campaign to oppose the institution of a state income tax in Tennessee, a cause championed by Republican Governor Don Sundquist. Ben Cunningham and state radio personalities Phil Valentine, Steve Gill, Darrell Ankarlo, and Dave Ramsey, aided by Republican lawmakers such as Marsha Blackburn, spearheaded an effort that involved dissemination of information over the air waves, email lists, and a web site, emails and telephone calls to state legislators, postal mailing of tea bags to officials, street protests and driving past the State Capitol building whilst honking their automobile horns, and a tactic that a Los Angeles Times reporter referred to as \\"steering protesters to lawmakers' homes.\\" According to Mr. Cunningham, in addition to the honking of automobile horns among the activists at the State Capitol there was a competition to produce the loudest noise which was achieved in 2002 with a dismounted train whistle powered by a portable air compressor, requiring other protesters to cover their ears when it was sounded once or twice per day. Late in 2001 the Tennessee Tax Revolt organization was incorporated as a public benefit corporation and by the end of 2002 the campaign had been successful and the effort to enact an income tax had ceased. The TTR web site hosts photographs from the 2001 and 2002 protests. In 2004 the group claimed that their email list was subscribed to by five thousand recipients. Activities In the first decade after its formation, Tennessee state and local media outlets frequently sought comment from TTR on taxation and budgetary issues. For example, in 2009 WTVF / NewsChannel 5 of Nashville interviewed Mr. Cunningham about an increase in the per diem reimbursement rates for the members of the state legislature. In his capacity as spokesman for Tennessee Tax Revolt Mr. Cunningham has been a speaker and presenter at Tea Party movement events and other fiscal conservative rallies around Tennessee and around the country. TTR has also hosted its own events such as a 2010 celebration commemorating the anniversary of the signing of the United States Constitution at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, in cooperation with other Tennessee groups. State and local TTR has engaged in a variety of efforts to educate and inform Tennessee citizens and lawmakers. Its web site hosts a page titled as the \\"Taxpayer Information Center\\" which contains an extensive directory of hyperlinks to online resources relating to Tennessee local and state government, Tennsessee politics, blogs, and other information sources, however as of 2012 many of the links are broken. In 2011 Mr. Cunningham was a guest speaker at a paid event held by several other state organizations and described as a conservative \\"grassroots legislative training\\" session. TTR has sponsored an ongoing effort to persuade state legislators, officials, and candidates to sign a \\"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\\" promising not to raise taxes. The organization has also sponsored polls of Tennessee voters on various issues. Various candidates over the years have received support from TTR. A 2002 press release presented a long list of endorsements in state elections. Edward Glenn Bryant, former U.S. Representative from Tennessee, was supported by TTR during his unsuccessful 2006 bid for a Tennessee U.S. Senate seat. In 2005 TTR gave a \\"Taxpayer Hero Award\\" to State Representative Donna Rowland and anointed the City of Memphis the booby prize winner of the \\"Tennessee Tax Bowl\\" for having the highest combined county and municipal tax rate in the state. The Tennessee Alliance for Progress invited Mr. Cunningham as a panelist in a 2005 \\"Ethics Town Hall Meeting\\" concerning transparency and accessibility of state government. In 2006 TTR spearheaded a successful effort and petition drive to amend the Nashville city charter requiring any increase in property taxes to be approved by voters. Since 2008 a project of TTR has been monitoring the budgeting process for a planned convention center to be constructed in Nashville. In January 2010 the group issued a press release proposing to recall any city council member who supported issuance of bonds to finance the center. In 2009 TTR spoke at a Nashville Tea Party rally in opposition to the federal bank bailouts in response to the financial crisis and in opposition to the stimulus expenditures. TTR has spoken out over the property seizures and police raids of Gibson Guitar Corporation in Nashville over alleged violations of the Lacey Act governing the importation of wildlife and plants under conservation protection, specifically hardwoods used in the manufacture of that company's guitars. Speaking at a 2011 rally in support of Gibson Ben Cunningham called the raids an \\"overreach by the federal government\\" and an \\"abuse of power and authority\\" and said, \\"No American business should fear the government at their door with guns drawn.\\" In 2011 along with other state groups TTR asked state legislators to work to oppose federal health care reform measures. In the same year Mr. Cunningham was a speaker at a \\"Doctors and Patients Town Hall\\" political event at Lipscomb University sponsored by Ralph Weber's company MediBid and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and in an associated radio broadcast said that President Obama's reforms would \\"ruin our medical system\\" and result in a \\"decline into mediocrity and tyranny.\\" In 2012 Mr. Cunningham spoke out in favor of transparency in governmental economic development negotiations with private companies saying that Governor Bill Haslam and the State Funding Board need to \\"stop holding these secret negotiations with large corporations over handing out these huge wads of money.\\" A Tennessee 20th Senatorial District Republican candidate discussion forum in 2012 was moderated by Mr. Cunningham. 2012 legislation put forward in Tennessee to phase out and then completely eliminate inheritance tax was applauded by TTR, with Spokesman Ben Cunningham saying \\"getting rid of this tax will increase employment more than any other: it's going to bring capital, it's going to bring jobs, it's going to make Tennessee a much more desirable destination for people that are moving their businesses away from high-tax states.\\" The bill passed the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Bill Haslam. While most frequently protesting increases in personal taxes, TTR has also opposed some tax breaks offered to large companies and special exceptions to sales taxes. Ideology In a January 2011 presentation to the Tea Party of Bradley County entitled \\"How to Fight Local Tax Hikes and Win\\" Ben Cunningham introduced his topic by pointing out the narrow margin by which a state income tax measure was defeated in the Tennessee legislature in the contention over that issue one decade previous. He emphasized that a Tennessee state income tax is a genuine possibility in the future. After asserting the importance under the framing of the Founding Fathers of the United States for citizens to hold the government accountable and oppose tyranny in pursuit of a fair, just, and moral society, he stated that \\"there are people in Washington, D.C. that believe you shouldn't be allowed to live your life in freedom.\\" He then showed a photograph of a Cambodian girl who he said was executed by the Khmer Rouge, a man who he said was either executed in Stalinist Russia or worked to death in the Gulags during that period, and then a photo which he said depicted two Chinese Communist Party members who were executed during the Cultural Revolution. Elsewhere he has explained that these images are from a book entitled The Cruel Radiance: Photography and Political Violence by Susie Linfield. Mr. Cunningham continued, explaining that the key reason these and other tragedies occurred is that people did not fight back and did not take up the responsibility to preserve freedom. He stated that the basis of American exceptionalism on a functional level is that \\"we simply have a minority of people that demand to live in freedom\\" and included his Tea Party audience in that minority, which he numbered at approximately 15% of the population. In his view, this veneration of freedom is embodied by resistance to government intrusion into private life, which he illustrated with the examples of regulation of the insurance industry which constrains the consumer's options and selective government bailout of some businesses but not others. He said that this sort of governmental behavior inevitably leads to corruption. He finalized this articulation of the reasons to fight against tax hikes by gesturing to the third photograph and saying, \\"Thankfully we haven't had to result [sic] in violence and certainly no one is advocating that, but clearly many people have. And clearly many people had the opportunity to fight these forces of tyranny and they didn't do it. Ultimately, the burden is on our shoulders and we've got to accept that burden and we've got to take the time to get involved in government at every level - nationally, state, local.\\" In a number of public appearances Mr. Cunningham has said that government budgets derive from and therefore should be based upon the family budget, which is the most important budget of all. Therefore, in his framing, to maintain the health of government budgets it is essential to ensure health of the individual taxpayers' family budgets.

The film is based on the life of Evan Perry, who experienced bipolar depression from a young age. The documentary was filmed throughout Evan's life, because whenever his parents, Dana and Hart Perry, consulted a psychiatrist about Evan's suicidal comments or other signs of mental illness, the psychiatrists did not believe that their son was depressed. The footage was originally meant to show the healthcare professionals what was happening in Evan's life and to help them access the treatment Evan needed. Evan was diagnosed with depression at age 5, and he was later diagnosed with bipolar depression. Despite the treatment and medication received, he ended up killing himself in 2005 at age 15. Evan Perry had a family medical history involving serious mental illnesses. This documentary mostly focused on how his bipolar depression affected him and those who loved him. About four years after Evan's death, the documentary was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and released on television and DVD. Story= Early childhood  Evan was very loving towards his family and others. At school, he was always the model student, behaving very well and being helpful. When he was four years old, he started telling his mom that he wanted to kill himself. It shocked her because at that age, she thought kids would not even know what death is, and he did not seem sad when he was talking about dying. In kindergarten, Evan said he wanted to kill himself in front of the whole class. The teacher told his parents, and Hart and Dana Perry took him to see a therapist. In 1995, mental health professionals were uncertain whether young children could be depressed. Dana Perry, a professional filmmaker, knew that psychiatrists would not believe everything she told them about her son. At this point, she decided to film as much as she could from Evan's life, especially when he talked about suicide. At age 5, Evan Perry was diagnosed with depression, and he was prescribed Prozac. The medication did not seem to be working, but it was their only choice, so they decided to give it time. Evan was very much into filming, just like his parents. At home he would make skits with his brothers and film vacations, and at school he would make plays. Most of his plays were about death. By the time Evan was 7 years old, he started behaving like a teenager. His responses were really short towards his family, he was listening to Nirvana, he was writing songs about suicide, demons, and pain, and he would lock himself in his room away from everyone. His parents knew this behavior wasn't normal at this age, and they were concerned, but there wasn't much they could do.  Middle childhood  When Evan was 10 years old, he made his first attempt to commit suicide. He was at school and he sneaked off to the roof while everyone was at the playground below. He was standing on the ledge very calmly and one of his teachers was able to get him down from the roof while his parents got there. When his parents picked him up, they went straight to the Four Winds which is a mental institution. There they diagnosed him with Bipolar depression. His whole stay there, Evan kept saying that he simply did it for attention, however they knew it was just his way of getting the attention off of him. Evan was prescribed a dosage of lithium to help with the chemical imbalance in his brain. When Evan was stable enough to leave the institution, his parents sent him to Wellspring which is a home for troubled kids like Evan. At Wellspring he ran away his first night, but eventually he gave in and let himself get help. Evan became a boy again, he was no longer behaving like a broody teenager, he was playing games outside like every other kid would do. His family also went to Wellspring for family therapy, so that they could all learn to communicate and understand Evan. He seemed to be getting better, he seemed healthier and happier so he was taken out of Wellspring and was sent to York prep school.  Adolescence  At this school Evan became very involved, he made many friends and he would go out and have fun. Evan also got back into filming and he would make productions with his friends. None of his friends could tell that Evan had bipolar depression, the only time they noticed something off was closer to the time when he committed suicide. Many years passed and Evan was doing great at his school, his social life was great and he was very close to his family. When Evan was 15 he asked to be taken off the Lithium, his parents thought it could work if he gradually came off the medication. Little by little they reduced his dosage with the approval of his therapist, at first he seemed to be doing ok, but then it hit him like a truck. He didn't want to go out as much anymore, he was behaving differently and his parents decided it'd be best if he went back on the full dosage. They made an appointment with his therapist to alter his lithium dosage. Three days before his appointment, Evan got into an argument with his mom about doing his homework, he locked himself in his room but his dad did go to check on him and saw that he was doing homework. His dad was putting his little brother to sleep and looked into Evan's room again a few minutes after talking to him about doing his homework. Evan wasn't in his room, and the window was open. Evan had jumped out his window and left a numbered list of reasons to live and die for, then deciding that dying was his solution.  Family = Hart Perry (father)  Evan's father had a brother who was diagnosed with bipolar depression and committed suicide at the age of 21. Because of this, he did everything he could to prevent the same outcome for his son, Evan Perry. Hart did everything he could to make Evan happy, he would film with him, he would go to therapy with Evan, and he was very supportive. On the day that Evan committed suicide, Hart was the one that found him at the bottom, despite him previously checking in on Evan 5 minutes before, he couldn't stop the outcome.  Dana Perry (mother)  Evan's mother was equally supportive of Evan, and it was her idea to film everything going on in Evan's life so that therapists would believe her and would have a better idea of what is going on. When Evan was five years old he actually explained to his mother how he was going to commit suicide, very detailed as well. She recorded it and put it in the documentary and it shows Evan climbing onto his bed and showing his mom how he was going to hang himself from the roof of his room. Dana Perry was very caring towards her son and tried everything she could to stop his story from ending so soon.  Nicholas Perry (brother)  Nicholas Perry was Evan's half brother from the dads side of the family. Throughout the documentary, Nicholas explained how most of the songs Evan wrote were very relatable for someone Nick's age. Nicholas was more than 5 years older than Evan, so while Evan was 7 years old, writing songs about his inner pain and demons in his head, Nicholas was in high school and experiencing this. However, there is a certain level of normality when a teenager experiences these thoughts compared to a seven year old. When Evan committed suicide, Nicholas rushed over to the Perry's house to be there for them. When the suicide note was discovered and Nicholas read it, he realized that everything Evan was experiencing was common. Evan was scared of failing, he wanted to fit in, and he was insecure. Nicholas along with every teenager feels this at one point or another, Evan just felt it to a different intensity. Because of this, Nicholas felt responsible to some degree, he believed that if he had talked to Evan and told him that it was perfectly normal and ok to feel that way then Evan would've been saved.

The group's exhibitions in Copenhagen created wide international participation. After the Second World War, the association was revived as Linien II with emphasis on Concrete art. Background In the 1930s, art moved into a new phase experiments in the theoretical and intellectual use of shapes and symbols while at the same time a symbolism emerged from the world of dreams. This was the basis for Concrete art and Surrealism which became the latest trend in the international Avant- garde movement. The association of Abstraction and Surrealism was pioneered by Vilhelm Bjerke-Petersen who in 1930 joined the Bauhaus School in Weimar, a key Avant-garde institution which revolutionized not just painting but architecture, sculpture, literature, theatre and dance. Bauhaus is remembered for its influence on Abstract art and Functionalist architecture and design. At the Bauhaus, Bjerke Petersen had studied under Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee and was thus familiar with contemporary theories of abstract art. This led to the publication in 1933 of Symboler i abstrakt kunst (Symbols in Abstract Art) which served as a manifesto for the movement in Denmark.\\"Abstraktion og symbol. Linien I 1930- 1940\\" , Odense Bys Museer. . Retrieved 1 June 2012. The association In 1934, together with Ejler Bille and Richard Mortensen, Petersen founded Linien which covered both Abstraction and Symbolism. Together with its accompanying journal, also called Linien, the movement was a forum for new, revolutionary art in Denmark providing a \\"line\\" through all fields of art and culture. The first issue of the journal, which was published in conjunction with the association's opening exhibition on 15 January 1934, presented the movement as a group of abstract-surrealist artists who would endeavor to provide support for innovative art. The first exhibition presented 177 works and was seen by 2,500 visitors.\\"Linien\\", KunstOnLine.dk. Retrieved 1 June 2012.\\"Linien\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 1 June 2012. In 1935, Viljelm Bjerke Petersen, who had become more interested in pure Surrealism, invited Wilhelm Freddie and Harry Carlsson to participate in the large international exhibition on Cubism and Surrealism instead of Bille and Mortensen. The exhibition is considered to be one of the most important in Denmark, bringing together Erik Olson, Jean Arp, Max Ernst, Paul Klee, Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí and Yves Tanguy. Bille and Mortensen terminated their collaboration with Petersen and in 1937 put on a kind of repeat international exhibition of Cubism-Surrealism with Abstract and Constructive artists including Theo van Doesburg, Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky and Sophie Taeuber-Arp together with the Surrealists Max Ernst, Paul Klee, Joan Miró and Yves Tanguy and a considerable number of Danish artists. Linien's last exhibition was held in 1939 with the participation of Mortensen, Bille, Egill Jacobsen and the sculptor Sonja Ferlov. Follow-up In 1947, a number of artists including Ib Geertsen, Bamse Kragh-Jacobsen, Niels Macholm, Albert Mertz and Richard Winther created Linien II with an exhibition in Tokanten's gallery in Copenhagen. Other members of the group included Vilhelm Bjerke Petersen, Richard Mortensen, Sonja Ferlov Mancoba, Robert Jacobsen, Paul Gadegaard, Gunnar Aagaard Andersen, Henrik Buch, Helge Jacobsen, Søren Georg Jensen and Knud Nielsen. An exhibition the following year presented Constructive works, providing support for Concretism in Denmark. In 1950, Linien II held Denmark's largest exhibition of Concrete art with wide international participation including works by Wassily Kandinsky, Fernand Léger, Jean Arp, Le Corbusier, Auguste Herbin, Alexander Calder, Victor Vasarely, Alberto Magnelli and Jean Dewasne. The event led to the withdrawal of the French as well as Mortensen and Jacobsen who did not take part in the last two exhibitions held in 1951 and 1952. These did however attract a considerable number of American artists including Josef Albers. Although Linien II was dissolved in 1952, two further exhibitions were held: Linien 3, konkret realisme (Linien 3, Concrete Realism) in 1956 and Linien igen (Linien Again) in 1958. They presented works by more recent Concrete artists including Ole Schwalbe, Jørn Larsen and Mogens Lohmann. \\"Linien II\\", KunstOnLine. Retrieved 2 June 2012.

The launch occurred on March 1, 2013. A minor technical issue on the Dragon spacecraft involving the RCS thruster pods occurred upon reaching orbit, but it was recoverable. The vehicle was released from the station on March 26, 2013, at 10:56 UTC and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean at 16:34 UTC. History The SpaceX CRS-2 Falcon 9 launching on March 1, 2013 The planned shipment of the Falcon 9 first stage from Texas to the Florida launch site was delayed due to the ongoing investigation of the engine failure that occurred on the previous flight. In late November 2012, it was reported that the CRS-2 Falcon 9 had been transported to Cape Canaveral. A static fire test occurred for the CRS-2 Falcon 9 on February 25, 2013. Firsts The Dragon unpressurized trunk section, which allows the transport of unpressurized cargo to the ISS, had its first use on this flight. This cargo consisted of two Heat Rejection Subsystem Grapple Fixtures (HRSGFs), which are essentially bars to be attached to the ISS radiators to allow for future movement work. Payload When launched the CRS-2 Dragon was filled with about of cargo, without packaging. Included is of crew supplies, of scientific experiments and experiment hardware, of hardware for the station and other miscellaneous items, among them a CD copy of the song \\"Up in the Air\\" by rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars, was premiered on board the International Space Station on March 18, 2013, during a NASA TV broadcast from the station. The two Heat Rejection Subsystem Grapple Fixtures (HRSGFs) had a combined weight of and were transported to the ISS inside the unpressurized Dragon trunk as external cargo. The Dragon returned of cargo, without packaging. Included is of crew supplies, of scientific experiments and experiment hardware, of space station hardware, of spacesuit equipment and other miscellaneous items. Dragon thruster pods anomaly Shortly after second stage separation, at 15:45 UTC on March 1, 2013, the Dragon spacecraft encountered technical problems involving its Propulsion System. \\"When priming its four Draco Thruster Pods, the vehicle detected insufficient pressurization on the oxidizer (Nitrogen Tetroxide) system\\" of three of the pods which \\"caused the Flight Computers to place the vehicle in Passive Abort Mode.\\" In this mode, Dragon is not executing any more orbital operations. Its thruster system was disabled and the solar arrays were not deployed since the vehicle had not achieved its proper solar array deployment attitude. \\"Dragon is programmed not to open its arrays outside its proper attitude configuration to avoid contact with the second stage. This rule is in place for scenarios in which Dragon is not properly separated from the Falcon 9 Booster. As time progressed, teams working at SpaceX Mission Control, MCC-X in Hawthorne, California, started assessments of the issue.\\" During the early minutes and hours of the mission, the mission progress news came in bits, some of it over social media. An update from Elon Musk on Twitter clarified: > Issue with Dragon thruster pods. System inhibiting three of four from > initializing. About to command inhibit override. At 16:12 UTC, Elon Musk announced that a \\"command inhibit override\\" would be issued as the Dragon module was \\"about to pass over Australia ground station.\\" Initially solar array deployment was held \\"until at least two thruster pods are active.\\" SpaceX Mission Control decided to proceed with solar deployment due to array temperatures while the spacecraft was not in active attitude control at 16:40 UTC: \\"Thruster pod 3 tank pressure trending positive. Preparing to deploy solar arrays.\\" At 16:50 UTC, solar arrays had successfully been deployed on the Dragon spacecraft. Three of the four thruster pods on the Dragon spacecraft must be operational for berthing to be allowed with the International Space Station. After making corrections, SpaceX regained control of all four thruster pods and would be able to correct its course to the ISS. According to Elon Musk, \\"All systems green.\\" NASA officials said that the spacecraft would not rendezvous with the ISS on March 2 as was originally planned. It would instead rendezvous on March 3. Dragon was grappled with Canadarm2 by NASA Expedition 34 commander Kevin Ford and NASA flight engineer Tom Marshburn at 10:31 UTC on March 3, and was berthed to the nadir (Earth- facing) docking port of the Harmony module at 13:56 UTC. Remainder of mission (March 3 to 26) The Dragon capsule after being transported to shore on March 27, 2013 On March 6, 2013, the space station's Canadarm2 removed the grapple bars from Dragon's trunk. This event marked the first delivery of unpressurized cargo from a commercial spacecraft to the ISS. The spacecraft's return to Earth was postponed to March 26 from its originally scheduled date of March 25 due to inclement weather developing near its targeted splashdown site in the Pacific Ocean. The additional day spent attached to the orbiting laboratory did not affect science samples scheduled to return aboard the spacecraft. On March 26, Dragon was unberthed from the Harmony node by the Canadarm2 at 08:10 UTC by commands from ground controllers. Its release from Canadarm2 occurred at 10:56 UTC; the Expedition 35 crew then commanded the spacecraft to slowly depart from the International Space Station. The SpaceX Dragon fired its engines for the last time at 15:42 UTC sending it through the Earth's atmosphere for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at 16:34 UTC. A team of SpaceX engineers, technicians and divers recovered the vehicle and its scientific cargo off the coast of Baja, California, for the journey back to shore which took about 30 hours.

The Archers of Loaf Live at Cat's Cradle, Every Everything: The Music, Life & Times of Grant Hart, and Who is Lydia Loveless?; his animal welfare documentary A Dog Named Gucci; and his debut novel The Second Greatest Story Ever Told.  Early life  Bechard was born in Waterbury, Connecticut to Gorman \\"Gary\\" E. Bechard Jr., a bar and restaurant entrepreneur, and Lucille Claire Bechard. Lucille died when Bechard was 10 years old, so he and his sister Deborah were raised by his grandparents, William and Claire Roberts. He also has two half-brothers, Thomas and Sean. Bechard graduated from Holy Cross High School in Waterbury. While in high school, Bechard became interested in writing after reading Kurt Vonnegut’s Breakfast of Champions and Richard Brautigan’s In Watermelon Sugar. He attended Western Connecticut State University, where he studied journalism.  Career  Bechard worked as the music critic for the Waterbury Republican & American newspaper and started a local music fanzine called Imagine. In 1981, Bechard took a course on director Alfred Hitchcock at the New School for Social Research in New York City, and shortly thereafter found himself studying 16mm film production and taking uncredited courses part time there.  Early Films = Disconnected  1983, Bechard shot his first feature film, Disconnected, while still studying film in New York City. Made on a budget of $40,000 and filmed in his native Waterbury, it was a creepy take on the horror movement of the time. A restored version of this film was released on BluRay by Vinegar Syndrome on November 24, 2017. His long-lost first documentary, Twenty Questions, was included as an extra on the BluRay release.  Psychos in Love  Bechard's next film, 1986's Psychos in Love, was a horror comedy that has been called \\"the first Scream.\\" Conceived as a slasher film in the style of Woody Allen, Monty Python and the Marx Brothers, Bechard's film went on to play a midnight run at the famed Bleecker Street Cinema in Greenwich Village before being released on video by Empire Pictures. In HorrorNews.Net, Todd Martin wrote, \\"It's violent and gory while being sweet and funny at the same time and after everything was said and done I ended up digging it a lot more than I ever thought that I would.\\" A restored version of Psychos in Love was released on Blu-ray from Vinegar Syndrome on September 26, 2017. In Letterboxd, Mondo Cinema wrote, \\"This is the best time I've ever had watching a slasher flick.\\" Bechard entered into a four-picture deal with Empire Pictures that was fraught with conflict. Empire went out of business, and Bechard, having had enough, shifted his career to writing novels and scripts.  Novels = The Second Greatest Story Ever Told  Bechard's first novel, The Second Greatest Story Ever Told, was published by Citadel Underground in 1991 and was called \\"a very, very funny book\\" by the Los Angeles Times. It tells the tale of God sending his quirky teenaged daughter to save the world. The book has been optioned by Hollywood numerous times, and has had many leading actress attached to play the role including Winona Ryder, who in the Hot issue of Rolling Stone magazine proclaimed her next role was playing the female Jesus, to most recently Rooney Mara, who can be seen on the cover of the paperback release of the novel.  The Hazmat Diary  In 1993, long before the widespread availability of broadband internet, he produced a multi-media web novel called The Hazmat Diary, which featured images, video clips, and music programmed in Flash. The site was eventually taken down in 2007, and the story was published in paperback form in 2010.  Balls  His next novel Balls was published by Penguin Books in 1995. It tells the fictional story of the first woman to play major league baseball. The book was optioned by 20th Century Fox but never made into a film.  Good Neighbors  Next came Good Neighbors, published by Carroll & Graf in 1998, of which Publishers Weekly said, \\"In his first mystery, novelist Bechard deftly captures the story's working-class neighborhood setting,\\" adding \\"Bechard's ear for dark comedy and eye for social nuance are this book's strong suits.\\"  Ninth Square  Of Ninth Square (Forge, 2003) Publishers Weekly said, \\"the suspense level remains high to the end, as Shute, suspended from the force, attracted to a female cop but entangled with one of the likable and believable hookers he encounters in the escort industry, strives to find all the answers.\\"  Unwound  Unwound, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Baine, and published by Onyx in 2007.  Recent Narrative Films = The Kiss  In 2002, Bechard returned to filmmaking with The Kiss, starring Terence Stamp and Eliza Dushku. But once again the process made him question whether directing was a career path he wanted to travel.  You Are Alone  In 2005, Bechard decided to take one last stab at filmmaking. He would do a micro-budget film where all the control was in his hands. The film, You Are Alone, a dark drama exploring how far some people will go to feel less alone, went on to play numerous film festivals and win many \\"best-of\\" awards before being released on DVD. In Letterboxd, Keith Dwyer wrote, \\"You Are Alone has one of the best scripts that I've ever come across. It's dialogue is so visceral and really grabbed at my insides. It's a conversation that spans an hour and a half, and is an analytical look at how we deal with the parts of ourselves that we are disgusted by or fear to confront. There are flashback sequences that are interspersed within the main conversation sequences to provide context for the characters and they play out just like that of memory with how simply yet effectively they're edited. It's hard to say whether it will pack the same punch for everyone as it did for me, but it's floored me.\\"  Friends (with benefits)  Bechard's next independent feature was 2009's Friends (With Benefits). The film likewise played many film festivals and is being distributed by Cinetic Media. In Letterboxd, Monsieur Flynn wrote, \\"It's got the heart, the non PG-13 realism in nudity, the soundtrack to give additional value, the real human feel of flawed relationships, friendships and fear of the next step, and it brings funny to the table without the awkward Hollywood-takes. It's just an enjoyable trip into a terrain that never really surprise you, but yet is so heartfelt and true it's easy to get lost in.\\"  Broken Side of Time  His last narrative film, 2013's Broken Side of Time, premiered at VisionFest in New York City in June 2013, and won the Audience Choice Award for Best Narrative Feature at CineKink 2014. It was released on DVD and streaming media in May 2014. In Blurt, Danny Phillips wrote, \\"Watching Dolce's slip into the abyss is somewhat like watching a car stranded on the tracks as a train barrels towards it. You really want to help, to scream 'Get out of the way!' but deep inside we want to see what happens next. Broken Side of Time is a look at a journey and a destination, a glimpse at what happens when you give all yourself to something and are used, tossed aside in return. Dolce is a train wreck personified and I could not stop watching.\\"  Documentaries =Color Me Obsessed, a film about The Replacements Color Me Obsessed, Bechard's first documentary is about legendary 80s indie rock band the Replacements. Called \\"the rock version of Rashomon\\" by the Village Voice, and one of \\"the seven best new music documentaries of the year\\" by Rolling Stone, the film has been playing the film festival and arthouse circuit since its premiere in March 2011. It was released on DVD in November 2012. Though the film \\"hasn't a single second of their music, zero interviews with surviving band members and only briefly shows a few photos of the band at its ending, Color Me Obsessed: A Film About the Replacements manages to be one of the best documentaries on any subject I've seen this year.\\"  What Did You Expect? the Archers of Loaf love at Cat's Cradle  Bechard's film What Did You Expect? is a concert documentary capturing Archers of Loaf on their recent reunion tour. The film had its world premiere at the NXNE Festival in Toronto in June 2012, and was released on DVD in November 2012. In 2015, the band released the double album Curse of the Loaf, which is the Brian Paulson-produced concert audio from Bechard's documentary. The deluxe package also featured a copy of the film.http://www.avclub.com/article/archers-loaf-releasing-new-live-double- album-playi-218978  Every Everything: the music, life & times of Grant Hart  Every Everything: The Music, Life & Times of Grant Hart is a documentary on Grant Hart of the legendary 80s indie rock band Hüsker Dü, premiered in London at the Raindance Film Festival and in New York City at the CBGB Festival in October 2013, and was the opening-night film of the Sound Unseen Film & Music Festival in Minneapolis/St. Paul in November. In Tiny Mix Tapes, Paul Bower wrote, \\"Grant Hart is weird because he kind of gets how important he was for rock & roll and at the same time he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about. While it's a cliche to even bring it up, he has a definite Minnesota Nice quality in regard to discussing what he's done with his artistic career and how much what he's done might have influenced the world of modern Western music. Parts of Every Everything are frustrating, but they're frustrating because the film's subject himself is quintessentially frustrating. Bechard has done that rare thing in documentary filmmaking. He's fully allowed his subject to dictate the tone of the film. As an audience, we’re better off because of it.\\" While in PopShifter, Chelsea Spear said, \\"Throughout Every Everything, Bechard paints a very human portrait of Grant Hart, who comes off as self-aware and clear-eyed after a series of setbacks and bad decisions. Ultimately, the film could illustrate another truism: 'living well is the best revenge.'\\" In Letterboxd, Larry Yoshida writes, \\"This is the film I want to force all those mall punks and \\"I'm so Alternative\\" hipsters to watch.\\"  A Dog Named Gucci  In 2015 Bechard directed and co- produced with his wife Kristine Bechard the feature A Dog Named Gucci, a documentary about animal abuse and the laws regarding such abuse in the United States, The story of Gucci is set in Mobile, Alabama, where \\"some local thugs got angry at a 15-year-old runaway girl because she wouldn't do sexual favors for them. So they set her 10-week-old dog on fire. A professor down the street, Doug James, saw the flames and saved the dog, Gucci, by dousing them. Then he took in the dog, nursing him back to health with the help of a veterinarian. The thugs were caught, but the ringleader got a prison sentence of just six months. James was so incensed that he fought to get a state law passed to make such an offense a felony. Six years later, he succeeded.\\" The film had its world premiere at the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival in February 2015. The film was released on DVD from MVD Entertainment in April 2016. The end-credits song from the film, \\"One Voice,\\" features the talents of Norah Jones, Aimee Mann, Susanna Hoffs, Lydia Loveless, Neko Case, Kathryn Calder, and Brian May. The single was released on Record Store Day, April 16, 2016, with the proceeds going to benefit animal charities.  Who is Lydia Loveless?  Bechard has also just completed a documentary on singer- songwriter Lydia Loveless called Who is Lydia Loveless?, in which he documents the making of Loveless's album Real (2016), as well as following her on the road and looking into what life is life for a band at her level in the music industry.from and interview on the Americana Music Show #299, published May 10, 2016 \\"I also wanted to look at stuff we normally don't see a lot of. What are the finances for a band like this? Where does the money go? Who gets the money? Is Spotify good? Is Spotify bad? How does piracy affect you? What about the fans? I really wanted to go into all of that for a band that can sell out 200- or 250-seat venues and bars but is still traveling in an old Ford van. A good night is when they have a couple of hotel rooms. No one is rolling in the dough, so to speak. So what is it at that point when you have amazing critical success and acclaim but you're not there yet?\\" In October 2015, Bechard and his crew filmed a live Lydia Loveless concert at Skully's in her hometown of Columbus for the documentary. http://www.columbusalive.com/content/stories/2015/10/15/the-ten-best-rock- docs-of-all-time-in-the-humble-opinion-of-a-rock-documentarian.html accessdate=15 October 2015 The film had its world premiere at the Columbus International Film & Video Festival on April 7, 2016. The documentary was released on DVD and streaming media on November 24, 2017. Modern Vinyl said of the film, \\"Shot with Loveless and her band while on tour and recording her album Real, the film takes a hard look at what it's like to be a musician in these modern times. It notably addresses the financial aspects of playing rock ‘n’ roll in an age of Spotify and YouTube, and what that means for someone's bottom line. Who Is Lydia Loveless? is the sort of documentary that gets inside the whys and wherefores of music, while also adding in some rather excellent performance footage, shot both on tour and at a ripping show at Skully's in Columbus, Ohio. It's heartfelt and honest, told in the words of those involved in bringing Loveless’ brutally honest music to life. While label folks and producers speak, there are no discussions with fans or family — this is a film about the music.\\"  What it Takes: film en douze tableaux  Bechard also revealed during an iCRVradio interview on May 2, 2017 with Robin Andreoli that he had begun work on a rock documentary about North Carolina alt-country band Sarah Shook and the Disarmers called What It Takes: film en douze tableaux. The film, edited in the style of the Jean-Luc Godard film from which it takes half its name, had its world premiere at Independent Film Festival Boston in April 2018. The film also played the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in August of that same year, and was released on DVD on November 9, 2018. As the music blog If It's Too Loud says, \\"What makes Gorman Bechard's documentaries truly work for my is that he takes these high falutin' film concepts and uses them for film documentaries. Film documentaries are typically put out by a record company as a way to cash in on an artist and are little more than fluff pieces, or they focus on drama within a band. What it Takes: film en douze tableaux doesn't do any of that. While Bechard is an obvious fan of his subject, he shows them as is, and doesn't try to show them glossed over or hyped up.\\"  Twenty Questions  It was also announced that a long-thought-lost first documentary from Bechard called Twenty Questions would have its world premiere at the New Haven Documentary Film Festival in June 2017. In the 60-minute film originally shot in 1987 and never screened publicly, twenty people, from all walks of life, are each locked alone in a room for the length of one 400-foot roll of 16mm film (11 minutes). They are each given the same set of twenty questions, which they can answer at random...if they're not completely distracted by their surroundings. The film is a featured extra on the Blu-ray release of his first feature Disconnected. Pizza, A Love Story Directed by Bechard, and co-produced with long-time musical collaborator Dean Falcone and New Haven historian Colin M. Caplan, the love story to New Haven's holy trinity of pizza restaurants, Pepe's, Sally's, and Modern, had its world premiere at IFFBoston in April 2019. It screened at a number of films festivals including the Greenwich International Film Festival, NHdocs: the New Haven Documentary Film Festival, Sidewalk Film Festival, the Woods Hole Film Festival, and the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival in 2019. The film was released on DVD and pay-per-view on September 29, 2020. In reviewing the film, Deborah Brown of The Swellesley Report called it “An important film of staggering genius that needed to be made.” While in Letterboxd, Michael Viers writes, \\"What could have very easily been a bunch of people gate-keeping pizza turned into a very weird, funny documentary full of pizza nerds.\\" Seniors A Dogumentary In May 2017, Bechard also launched a Kickstarter for a new animal documentary, this one called Seniors A Dogumentary, that celebrates the brains, energy & sass of some of the coolest senior dogs on this planet and the people who love them. The film premiered on March 5, 2020 at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville. The film \\"is a documentary by Gorman Bechard with three interwoven stories that include Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary, which cares for about 90 senior dogs on-site with about 300 more placed in foster homes\\" and also highlights the late Chaser (dog) the Border Collie, referred to as the smartest dog in the world, and Jane Sobel Klonsky, whose work has included capturing the bond between elderly dogs and their owners.\\" Released on DVD and pay-per-view on September 29, 2020, the film received rave reviews. Robin in Reeling Reviews writes, \\"Documentary writer-director-participant Gorman Bechard does just what I expected when I started watching “Seniors.” He takes a subject matter that, on the surface, might turn off potential viewers. A documentary about old dogs and their last days should be a bummer, but not here. Here we have a true life story about love, dignity and the quality of life for our old canine friends.\\" While Pam Powell in The Daily Journal says, \\"Watching this film will change how you see dogs, and perhaps even your own buddy, thanks to Bechard’s keen perspective bringing this film to life.\\" and adds, \\"Yes, you’ll need a tissue or two, but be prepared for many more involuntary smiles that go from ear to ear.\\"  Documentaries in production  In July 2015, a Seed&Spark; campaign was launched for a new documentary, Normal Valid Lives, a film about the Anoka- Hennepin school district bullying case which made national headlines. In September 2017, Bechard launched a Kickstarter campaign for his sixth rock documentary, Where are you, Jay Bennett? one of the legendary guitarists from the band Wilco. In the summer of 2019, Bechard and producer, Bill Kraus, launched a Kickstarter campaign for FACTORY, a new feature-length documentary about the many varied and crazy lives of the New Haven Clock Company factory. Portions of the documentary were previewed in an exhibit at the New Haven Museum and Historical Society in February 2020.  Music Videos  In July 2016, two Bechard-directed music videos had their premiere in Rolling Stone magazine. The first was \\"Heal Me\\" from the album Sidelong by North Carolina musicians Sarah Shook and the Disarmers. A few days later, \\"Longer,\\" from the fourth Lydia Loveless album, Real, was released. It is also the first official Loveless music video. And on August 19, the second Bechard-directed music video from Real was released for the song \\"Clumps.\\" Noisey, the music division of Vice magazine, called it \\"simple and gorgeous.\\" In May 2017, another two Bechard-directed music videos were released back-to-back. The first, which was premiered by Diffuser.fm, was for \\"(I Just Died) Like an Aviator\\" for Matthew Ryan, which featured a group of teenaged girls lip-syncing and rocking out to the song. The video starred Chloe Barczak as the singer, Carina Begley as the guitar player, Chloe Lang as the bass player, and Erica Gonsiewski as the drummer. Realizing that having real teenagers behind the scenes as well as in front of the camera could only help the authenticity, Bechard brought on interns 17-year-old Charlotte Beatty and 15-year-old Isabella Germano to co- produce the video. American Songwriter Magazine wrote: \\"a coltish, all-girl band plays the parts of Ryan and co., rocking out in the confines of a dingy basement, and the result is oddly effective. The song takes on an added poignancy as a charismatic teenaged singer mouths lines like \\"I'm pouring a drink/ And smoking a smoke/ Our guts are born in that fiery trench/ Between hurt and hope\\" in the raspy, cigarette drawl of a middle-aged man.\\" The other music video for \\"Nothin' Feels Right But Doin' Wrong\\" by Sarah Shook and the Disarmers was premiered by Fader, for the Bloodshot Records re-release of the band's debut album, \\"Sidelong.\\". 2018 brought two new Bechard-directed music videos to the world: \\"The Bottle Never Lets Me Down\\" from Sarah Shook and the Disarmers was premiered by Rolling Stone, for the Bloodshot Records release of the band's second album, \\"Years,\\", and American Songwriter premiered the video for the acoustic version of \\"I Just Died Like An Aviator\\" from Matthew Ryan (musician).  NHdocs: the New Haven Documentary Film Festival  In 2014, Bechard co-founded NHdocs: the New Haven Documentary Film Festival (NHdocs), which he co-directs with Yale Film and Media Studies professor Charles Musser. The festival expanded from one day screening four films in 2014 to three days and over 20 films in 2015. In 2016, the festival expanded to 11 days, showing over 40 films, including Bechard's Who is Lydia Loveless? followed by a solo acoustic performance from Lydia Loveless. The 2017 version of the festival featured over 80 films and a tribute to the legendary D.A. Pennebaker. In 2018 the festival featured tributes to Amy Berg (documentary filmmaker), Su Friedrich, and HBO's Sheila Nevins. While in 2019, the sixth edition featured over 100 films, including the completed Pizza, A Love Story, and a weekend long tribute to documentarian Michael Moore, with Moore in attendance being interviewed about his work by friends Peter Davis, DA Pennebaker, and Chris Hegedus. The festival screened seven of his most famous films including Roger & Me, Bowling for Columbine, Where to Invade Next, Fahrenheit 9/11 and Fahrenheit 11/9. In 2020, the festival moved to August due to Covid-19, but still screened over 120 films online and in-person, and also included a student competition, a quarantine film challenge, workshops, Q&As;, and a tribute to Johnny Cash.

As with many other social networking WWW sites, the postings and pictures by celebrity users attracts people to the site, which increases opportunity for advertising. To this end, Twitter has provided two facilities to its high-profile users. The first is the . Introduced in June 2009, the verified account system provides Twitter readers with a means to distinguish genuine accountholders from impostors. A symbol displayed against the account name indicates that Twitter has taken steps to ensure that the account has the approval of the person whom it is claimed to be, or represent. However, the public signup page for obtaining verified accounts was discontinued in 2010, with Twitter explaining that the volume of requests for verified accounts had exceeded its ability to cope; and nowadays Twitter determines itself whom to approach about verified accounts, limiting them to \\"highly sought after users\\", \\"business partners\\", and \\"individuals at high risk of impersonation\\". Business partners include those who advertise using Twitter, although it is not clearly spelled out in the material that Twitter provides to its business partners when and whether they might qualify for having verified account status. Secondly, Twitter attempts to work with celebrity and media public relations staff to encourage them to make use of Twitter in their advertising and publicity campaigns, encouraging them to use Twitter in their promotional campaigns, and providing support and analysis services to determine what worked, what created \\"buzz\\", and what did not.  Celebrity entertainers, models and sportspeople  Twitter can be used by celebrities, athletes and other famous people for their own self-promotion. In a growing world of technology, many celebrities feel obligated to have their own accounts. They use it to engage with fans. Athletes can also spur competition among themselves using Twitter. However, for celebrity users, Twitter has proven to be a double-edged sword. Along with the laudatory comments from fans come hostile attacks from anonymous people; fan goodwill and even career opportunities can be lost through tweets, and several athletes have encountered trouble because of things that they have said on Twitter. A good example is the 2012 Summer Olympics. Many competitors were removed from the Olympics due to racially offensive comments that were posted on their accounts. It has become more of a necessity than ever for celebrities and public figures to be more composed online. Impulsive tweets have proven to be negative for their careers. Many celebrities do not actually maintain their own accounts; rather, the accounts are maintained by their publicists. The most popular United Kingdom celebrities on Twitter come from television with people like Stephen Fry and Jonathan Ross being amongst the most popular British celebrities on the site. Fry's success on Twitter is credited with being the same person on Twitter that he is off Twitter.  Musicians  Musicians have found Twitter to be a very promising place for self-promotion, engaging with fans, and gaining new supporters. It has become a useful tool for promoting new music such as an upcoming single, album, or feature. Fans can react to this by liking or responding to the tweet and that will subsequently lead to more interaction between the artist and their followers. Twitter has a live-streaming feature that facilitates interaction and artists can use this to directly interact in real-time. Twitter allows musicians to promote other fellow artists. They may post photos of them in the studio working with other artists and they can tag them in the post. This helps other artists gain recognition since any of the followers seeing the photo can visit the other artists' profiles. These practices are integral to growing one's fanbase since they can gain support through fellow musicians.  Politicians  Twitter is used by politicians including former US president Barack Obama, cabinet members in Chile, and politicians in Germany, Japan and India. These politicians use the platform to communicate with their constituents. Users may send questions and the congresspeople can directly respond. Blog posts and news articles may be directly linked and shared to all of their followers and anyone else who comes across their profile. They may also self-promote. During the 2016 US presidential election, the top three candidates (Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders) used Twitter to discuss their campaigns, gain followers and supporters, and talk amongst other candidates. These politicians would also talk negatively about each other and sling insults back and forth. Donald Trump would refer to Clinton as \\"Crooked Hillary\\" to further stir up their rivalries. Clinton famously rebutted with \\"Delete your account.\\" during this presidential race. Barack Obama was the most followed world leader when he was president with over 117 million followers on his personal Twitter. He is followed by the current most followed world leader US President Donald Trump with over 83 million followers on his own personal Twitter. Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India is the second most followed world leader with over 59 million followers on his personal Twitter. In the United Kingdom and the United States, politicians use Twitter to communicate and interact with their followers. Hillary Clinton used Twitter to promote her presidential campaign but unlike Obama, she did not follow back many of her new followers. In May 2011, 387 members of the United States Congress had Twitter accounts. During the primary race for president in 2008, John Edwards was also on Twitter. During the 2008 United States general election, during one monitored period, Obama made 261 Tweets while his Republican competitor John McCain made only 26.\\\\ On the state level in the United States, politicians tend to use Twitter primarily for constituent and policy-related issues. The second most popular category of tweets is personal musings. The type of communication by United States politicians on Twitter varies from highly personal to press release like. British politicians on Twitter include Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May. In Australia, the Greens were initially more successful on Twitter than other political parties. The Australian Labor Party's politicians have used Twitter to attack their opposition, with some one creating a parody account featuring Tony Abbott. Kevin Rudd does not appear to be making his own tweets, rather some one else is likely to be doing it for him. Chilean politicians are using Twitter as an alternative method of communications as they find the mainstream press not giving them media coverage. Politicians in Greece and Japan also use Twitter to communicate with their constituents. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has used Twitter to help change his image and make himself more personable. Venezuela President Hugo Chavez was one of the most followed Venezuelan accounts on Twitter.  Religious figures  On December 12, 2012 Pope Benedict XVI sent his first tweet which was re-tweeted by thousands of users almost immediately. Since this time the account @Pontifex has amassed over 17.9 million followers (as of March 2019) and regularly engages with users via the hashtag #AskPontifex addressing religious matters and responding to questions. Several satellite accounts are used to transmit and translate the Pope's tweets into different languages.

Onscreen it was semi-automatic pistol that could be converted to a carbine- sniper rifle that could fire full automatic. History The series began as a feature-length television pilot film written by Sam Rolfe titled Solo that was filmed in late November 1963. In the film Napoleon Solo carried a standard Luger pistol which in one scene he called an \\"X-38 Automatic\\". Stanley Weston, who had handled the toy licensing rights for Dr. Kildare, another MGM Television series produced by Norman Felton, was engaged to do the same for the show retitled The Man From U.N.C.L.E.. After viewing the Solo pilot in February, 1964, Weston wrote a letter to Felton expressing excitement over the show's merchandising potential. Weston made a list of 35 suggestions for emblem designs and spy gadgets that could be exploited for marketing purposes. Among them was the proposal for a distinctive pistol that should feature a silencer. \\"Also, from our viewpoint,\\" Weston added, \\"it would be great if Solo uses a machine gun from time to time\\".pp. 203-205 Walker, C.

Special was originally based on a 1934 7.65mm German Mauser pistol. While early episodes were being shot, the Mauser jammed frequently, and visually all the accessories added to convert the pistol to a carbine seemed to overwhelm the small pistol. It was soon replaced by the Walther P38 9mm Parabellum that the producers borrowed from the Combat! television series that was also shot on the MGM backlot.Heitland, J. The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Book: The Behind the Scene Story of a Television Classic St. Martin's Press New York 1987 The standard barrel of the P-38 was shortened and modified to accept a bird-cage flash suppressor. The Special was depicted on screen as firing \\"sleep darts\\". Although the non-lethal feature of the gun was always the intent of its creators, this was not always clearly shown to the audience especially in later seasons, and as producers changed. For situations where more firepower was necessary, the concealable pistol was modified to accept a barrel extension with hand-grip and silencer, a Phantom Bushnell pistol scope, an extended magazine and a collapsible shoulder stock. The bird cage suppressor, silencer and barrel extension were attached by threaded plugs. Though a sophisticated weapon on screen, the U.N.C.L.E. Special Carbine in reality could not shoot real bullets, only blanks. However the pistol alone was still a working firearm. It was also modified by the studio to allow it to fire in full automatic \\"machine gun\\" mode. Unfortunately, this caught the attention of the US Treasury Department- the manufacture of automatic weapons without a license is very illegal, and the show nearly had the guns confiscated. In the end MGM was fined $2000 and the matter was closed. The prop masters of the series created six U.N.C.L.E. Specials at a cost of approximately $1,500 per gun, but only two had the full array of attachments.p. 48 Walker, Cynthia M.

According to the club's rules, the object of their meeting was \\"to bring together, at stated periods during the winter season, a set of men highly respectable in society, who had passed their best days in a savage country and had encountered the difficulties and dangers incident to a pursuit of the fur trade of Canada\\". Only fragmentary records remain of their meetings, but from these it is clear that the Beaver Club was \\"an animated expression of the esprit de corps of the North West Company\\". The men of the Beaver Club were the predecessors of Montreal's Square Milers. Origins A Canadian fur trader in 1777. Cartouche from alt= John MacDonald of Garth A canoe of the rival Hudson's Bay Company in 1869, carrying the artist, Frances Anne Hopkins, and her husband, Edward Hopkins, secretary to the Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, in similar style as to the partners of the North West Company Alexander Henry (1739–1824), vice- chairman of the Beaver Club, published his account of living with the Ojibwa and subsequent explorations (1760-76) before becoming a partner of the North West Company. He introduced John Jacob Astor to the Club and the fur trade at Montreal In 18th century North America, the fur 'barons' of Montreal might only have been compared to the tobacco 'lords' of Virginia for their wealth and grand style of living. The members of the Beaver Club were bon vivants, renowned for the Scottish Highland hospitality they offered to their guests and for the jovial, rollicking behaviour that carried on at their meetings. In his entertaining book The Shoe and Canoe, the English geologist, John Bigsby, relates the character of these Montreal fur traders in their early days: A number of young men, chiefly of good Scotch families, able, daring, and somewhat reckless perhaps (a typical example being John MacDonald of Garth), formed themselves into a company (the North West Company) in order to traffic in the forbidden land (owned by the Hudson's Bay Company) in spite of the charter. A first-rate Indian trader is no ordinary man. He is a soldier- merchant, and unites the gallantry of the one with the shrewdness of the other. Montreal was then the best place for seeing this class of persons.. They spend fast, play all the freaks, pranks, and street-fooleries, and originate all the current whimsicalities: but this is their brief holiday: when they turn their faces westward, up stream, their manners change. The Indian Trader is a bold, square-chested, gaunt man, sun-burnt, with extraordinary long hair as a defence against mosquitoes. He is equally at home on horseback or in the canoe - indefatigable when needful, careless of heat and cold, and brave as steel, as though he bore a charmed life, in countries where the Queen's writ scarcely runs, where the law only of personal authority takes effect. Often he has not only to contend with the Indians, and to right himself on the spot with other traders, but he has to fight his own men hand to hand. Kindness, vigour, and sagacity, usually render but one such affair necessary. In 1786, controlled by Simon McTavish and the Frobishers, there were 28 chief partners of the North West Company and their business was conducted by an army of about 2,000 men, not including the native Indians. That year they exported furs to the value of £203,378: 116,623 beaver skins and 473,534 other pelts. As profits continued to soar, the chief partners of the North West Company retired from their expeditions into the wilderness to conduct their business with London and Paris from Montreal. Conducting themselves in suitable style, two or three of the chief partners would venture forth from Montreal to the annual meeting with the 'wintering (junior) partners' on the ground at Grand Portage (in what is now Minnesota) and Fort William (in what is now Ontario). At Lachine, the Montreal partners boarded their immense canoes manned by voyageurs and hunters in Buckskins with bright silk bands around their heads and neck. The voyageurs were the most experienced canoe-men and wilderness travelers in the world, and the partners took a high pride in the skill of their hardy henchmen, giving each on their arrival a régale, which meant a gallon of rum. The partners took their seats conspicuously dressed in ruffles and gold braid, with brass-handled pistols and daggers at their belts. In 1894, Brian Hughes recalled his grandfather (James Hughes, admitted a member of the club in 1813) recounting his memories of these partners journeying into the wilds: They traversed the rivers in great state, like sovereigns making a progress. They were wrapped in rich furs, their huge canoes freighted with every convenience and luxury and manned by Canadian voyageurs as loyal and as obedient as their own ancestral clansmen. They carried with them cooks and bakers, together with delicacies of every kind, and an abundance of choice wine for the banquets. The men of the Beaver Club had a great reputation for hospitality and generosity, which led to many of them frittering away their fortunes. One such example was The Hon. Nicholas Montour, who retired as a partner of the North West Company in 1792 with a fortune of £20,000. He purchased a seigneury, that ought to have furthered his fortune, but not before too long his style of living coupled with a free and generous disposition to his guests left him with nothing other than his manor house. In 1808, John Lambert recalled in reference to Montour: This too often happens with the gentlemen of the North-west company who retire from the concern. They emerge suddenly into civilized life after a banishment of many years in dreary forests and among a race of savages; and are apt to be dazzled by the glare of refinement and luxury, whose temptations are too powerful to be resisted. Hence they are frequently led into error and extravagance, which ultimately despoil them of their hard-earned property. Traditions Beaver Hall, the home of Joseph Frobisher. Built in 1792, the dining room comfortably sat 40 guests. Lord Dalhousie wrote in his diary: \\"Upon the whole I don't recollect having ever spent a more pleasant or more interesting day than that with the Beaver Club\\" At first, the nineteen incorporators of the Beaver Club maintained a rigid exclusiveness over its membership, but later their ranks were opened and the limit of membership was placed at fifty-five with ten honorary places. At the regular gatherings an opportunity was offered of introducing into society such traders as might from time to time return from the Indian country. Potential members were selected by ballot on the basis of their standing and character and then invited as a guest to one of the gatherings. Following the dinner, a vote was taken and only if approved of unanimously would they then be invited to join the Club. The vast majority of them were Highland Scots, but they were joined by French Canadians (the five most senior of the original members had been French Canadian), Englishmen, Irishmen and Loyalists, all \\"thoroughly cosmopolitan by taste and association\\". The first dinner of their season was held on the first Wednesday in December. Following that fortnightly meetings were held until April between private houses (notably at Beaver Hall, the home of Joseph Frobisher, whose dining table comfortably sat forty guests) and at various hotels and taverns in Montreal. These included the Mansion House Hotel and the City Tavern, both on Rue Saint-Paul; Richard Dillon's Montreal Hotel on the Place d'Armes; Palmer's Hummums and Tesseyman's. Records are scant, but the guests known to have attended included Lord Selkirk, General Sir Gordon Drummond, General Sir Isaac Brock, Washington Irving, General Sir Roger Sheaffe, Sir John Franklin, Thomas Moore, John Jacob Astor and Lord Dalhousie. The last named recorded in his diary: \\"Upon the whole I don't recollect having ever spent a more pleasant or more interesting day than that with the Beaver Club\\". In gratitude to member James Hughes, with whom he was staying with in Montreal, Dalhousie gave him a silver snuff box with gold trim, bearing the inscription: \\"The Earl of Dalhousie to James Hughes, Esq., in remembrance of the Beaver Club, May 24, 1824\\". The dinners commenced at 4:00 in the afternoon. Members arrived richly adorned in ruffles and a profusion of gold lace with knee-breeches above their gold-clasped garters and silver-buckled shoes. But, most importantly they wore the club's large gold medal with the inscription \\"Fortitude in Distress\\", that hung from a light blue ribbon around their necks. The start of the festivities were marked by the passing around of a calumet, followed by a speech or 'harangue' made by the evening's president. Toasts were then made, and there were always five to: The Mother of all Saints; the King; the fur trade in all its branches; voyageurs, wives and children; and absent members. Then, accompanied by Highland Pipers, on a dais of red velvet a flaming boar's head was brought into the dining room, a piece of camphor having been placed in its mouth before the grand entrance. The members and their guests were then permitted to pursue their own pleasures. Seated around a great mahogany table, servants plied the members in regular relays with luxuries from the east and the west, and costly delicacies from across the sea. The menu included country food such as Pemmican (brought from Saskatchewan), braised venison, bread sauce, \\"Chevreuil des Guides\\" (a stew), venison sausages, wild rice, quail and partridge \\"du Vieux Trappeur\\"; fish from the Great Lakes, pickled turnips, \\"Sweet Peace\\" applesauce, Atholl Brose, bear meat, buffalo tongue and bag pudding. This country food was served among the unfamiliar atmosphere of mahogany, crystal glass, crested silverware and soft candle glow. John Bigsby was told, that \\"on certain great occasions the last plate put on the table before each member held a cheque for a sum of money\\". After dinner, any previous formalities were laid aside as the men started to sing old voyageur songs and exchange tales about their perilous adventures in the old fur trading days. The festivities often ran into the early hours of the morning with the members dancing on the tables, re-enacting various canoeing adventures and breaking numerous bottles, plates, glasses and chairs in the process. There were many stories of the members arranging themselves on the floor in a row as if they were in a great canoe, imitating vigorous paddling (using fire pokers, swords, walking sticks etc., for paddles) and mounting wine barrels to \\"shoot the rapids\\" from the table to the floor. At one such dinner, twenty members (including Sir Alexander Mackenzie and William McGillivray) were still singing and dancing at 4am, and close to 120 bottles of wine were either drunk, broken or spilled that night. Dinner Bill On 17 September 1808, nineteen members met at Richard Dillon's Montreal Hotel on the Place d'Armes. Those present were: Joseph Frobisher (presiding); Alexander Henry the elder (vice-chairman); William McKay (the 'cork'); Alexander McKay; William McGillivray; James McGill; Isaac Todd; Josiah Bleakley; John Gregory; George Gillespie; Roderick Mackenzie of Terrebonne; Thomas Thain; General Sir Gordon Drummond; Sir John Johnson; Sir Roger Sheaffe; John MacDonald of Garth; Archibald Norman McLeod; Alexander McKenzie (cousin of Sir Alexander Mackenzie); and John Jacob Astor. The bill for this meeting was: 32 dinners (£12); 29 bottles of Madeira (6/); 19 bottles of Port (5/); 14 bottles of Porter (2/6); 12 quarts of Ale (8/); 7 suppers (8/9); Brandy and Gin (2/6); Cigars, pipes, tobacco (5/); Three wine glasses broken (3/9). Total: £28.15/. Members Joseph Frobisher was the enthusiastic founding chairman of the Beaver Club Charles Chaboillez, the club's most senior founding member, was perhaps the most influential French Canadian fur trader following the British Conquest Simon McTavish, the undisputed leader of the North West Company known for his generosity and refined style of living, was admitted into the Beaver Club in 1792 William McGillivray co-founded the Canada Club in London where meetings were reminiscent of the old Club All the names below appeared in Rules and Regulations of the Beaver Club, 1819, when only one of the original members was still alive. The nineteen original members were ranked in seniority by the date on which they had first entered the interior of Canada. As such, the French Canadian fur traders who had remained in the business after the British Conquest of New France held the most senior rank.

Finally, there were eleven honorary members, many of whom were the captains of the ships who transported their furs back to England. They could only attend at meetings held especially for them in the summer months. The dates in brackets show the year of their admission: Captain Featonby of the Eweretta (1789); Captain Gibson of the Integrity (1789); Monsieur le Compte Andriani, of Milan (1791); Captain Edwards of the Indian Trader (1792) ; Colonel Daniel Robertson, of Struan (1793); Major-General Sir John Doyle (1796); Captain Edward Boyd of the Montreal (1800); Captain Alexander Patterson of the Eweretta (1800); Major George Clerk, of the 49th Regiment (1807); Lord Viscount Chabot (1808), Quartermaster General of Canada; Captain Sarmon of the Mary (1808). Decline As trading posts were built it had become less dangerous to travel in the wilderness, and without competitors' territories to invade, the early spirit of adventure had disappeared from newcomers to the fur trade. By 1809, the seventy-year-old Alexander Henry hinted at a segregation between the young and old members in a letter to John Askin: \\"There is only us four old friends (himself, James McGill, Isaac Todd and Joseph Frobisher) alive, all the new North westards are a parcel of Boys and upstarts, who were not born in our time, and supposes they know much more of the Indian trade than any before them\\". The club continued to meet until 1804, and there was a resurgence of interest between 1807 and 1824, but when Sir George Simpson tried to revive its traditions in 1827 it was doomed to failure – the spirit enjoyed by the earlier traders had gone. However, several members, such as Angus Shaw, Robert Dickson, William McGillivray and John Forsyth became members of the smaller Canada Club in London (founded in 1810, and still extant), where meetings in the 1830s were reminiscent of the old Beaver Club.

She appeared in more than fifty films between 1925 and 1950.  Biography  Jenny Jugo was born Eugenie Walter on 14 June 1904, the daughter of a factory owner. After being educated in a convent, she married the actor Emo Jugo and accompanied him to Berlin. Although the marriage was short-lived, she continued to use his surname throughout her career.  Career  Jugo was placed under contract by the German studio UFA in 1924, but struggled in early dramatic roles. Towards the end of the silent era, she fared much better in comedies and this trend continued into the 1930s. She became known for her portrayal of bouncy, assertive characters. Many of her films during this period were directed by Erich Engel. She continued making films during the Nazi era until 1943, spending much of the rest of her time at her home in Bavaria. She was in a relationship with the producer Eberhard Klagemann who oversaw her final three post-war productions, including the DEFA comedy Don't Dream, Annette (1949). In 1950 she married her former co-star Friedrich Benfer and retired from acting at the age of forty six. In 1971 she received a lifetime achievement award for her outstanding contribution to German cinema.Bock & Bergfelder p.228 Filmography * The Tower of Silence (1925) * The Found Bride (1925) * If Only It Weren't Love (1925) * Frisian Blood (1925) * The Fire Dancer (1925) * Ship in Distress (1925) * Express Train of Love (1925) * The Doll of Luna Park (1925) * The Battle Against Berlin (1926) * Love is Blind (1926) * Unmarried Daughters (1926) * The Loves of Casanova (1927) * The Indiscreet Woman (1927) * The Trousers (1927) * The Queen of Spades (1927) * Prinz Louis Ferdinand (1927) * Looping the Loop (1928) * Six Girls and a Room for the Night (1928) * Docks of Hamburg (1928) * The Blue Mouse (1928) * The League of Three (1929) * The Smuggler's Bride of Mallorca (1929) * The Flight from Love (1929) * The Great Longing (1930) * Heute nacht - eventuell (1930) * Who Takes Love Seriously?

Biography His family moved to Latvia, where the former chaplain worked on the railroad. Lenga spent his one-year novitiate in the Marian Order, then a week visiting a monk, his spiritual mentor. From Latvia, he moved to Kaunas, Lithuania where there was one of only two Catholic seminaries in the then Soviet Union. He secretly graduated from the seminary, and was ordained in secret on May 28, 1980 by Bishop Vincentas Sladkevicius. In 1981, he arrived in Kazakhstan, where he performed pastoral ministry for 10 years. Lenga was appointed Apostolic Administrator of Kazakhstan and Central Asia, and Titular Bishop of Arba on April 13, 1991. He was consecrated a bishop on May 28, 1991. Lenga was next appointed bishop of Karaganda on August 6, 1999. He received the personal title of Archbishop on May 17, 2003. On February 5, 2011 Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation of Lenga, which he admittedly filed in accord with canon 401 § 2 of the Code of Canon Law. Diocesan bishops, who due to ill health or some other compelling reason is not fully be able to perform their duties, are urged to submit their resignation. However, Archbishop Lenga denies ever filing such a resignation. Lenga was appointed as the successor to the apostolic administrator of Atyrau, Bishop Janusz Kaleta. At this time, the retired archbishop was a resident of the monastic house of the Congregation of priests. Declaration of Truths On June 10, 2019, Lenga along with cardinals Raymond Leo Burke and Jānis Pujats, with Kazakh bishops Athanasius Schneider and Tomasz Peta published a 40-point \\"Declaration of Truths\\" claiming to reaffirm traditional Church teaching. The bishops wrote that such a declaration was necessary in a time of \\"almost universal doctrinal confusion and disorientation.\\" Specific passages in the declaration implicitly relate to several writings by Pope Francis. The declaration states that \\"the religion born of faith in Jesus Christ\\" is the \\"only religion positively willed by God,\\" seemingly alluding to a document signed by Pope Francis on February 4 called \\"Human Fraternity\\" which stated that the \\"diversity of religions\\" is \\"willed by God.\\" Following recent changes to the Catechism to oppose capital punishment, the declaration states that the Church \\"did not err\\" in teaching that civil authorities may \\"lawfully exercise capital punishment\\" when it is \\"truly necessary\\" and to preserve the \\"just order of societies.\\" Awards Jan Paul Lenga was awarded the Commander's Cross of Merit and the Order of the Republic of Poland. The awards were presented to Archbishop Jan Paul Lenga on September 2, 2011 on behalf of the President of Poland by Governor Peter Flerek from Wielkopolska.

Next to nothing is known about this ruler and some Egyptologists even believe him to be fictitious.Jürgen von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen Ägypten. Die Zeitbestimmung der ägyptischen Geschichte von der Vorzeit bis 332 v. Chr. (= Münchner ägyptologische Studien, vol. 46). von Zabern, Mainz 1997, , p. 158.  Identity = Possible name sources  In attempts to reconstruct Ancient Egyptian king lists, Egyptologists and historians face several problems. As already mentioned, Bikheris is a Hellenized name variation. The name appears in the book Aegyptiaca written by Manetho around 300 BC. In a Latin copy of Manetho, written by Eratosthenes, a king named Biuris is placed at the date when Bikheris allegedly ruled. Scholars wonder if both names actually derive from one and the same Egyptian source.Alan B. Lloyd: Commentary. In: Herodotus, Book II (= Etudes préliminaires aux religions orientales dans l'empire romain, vol. 43). BRILL, Leiden 1993, , p.76-78. However, ancient Egyptian sources are scarce. The oldest possible royal name source may come from an unfinished pyramid shaft at Zawyet el'Aryan. The shaft was excavated in 1904 by Italian Egyptologist Alessandro Barsanti. He discovered several black ink inscriptions inside the shaft, some of which actually show a royal cartouche name. Unfortunately, Barsanti made no facsimile, but sloppy drawings and all but the cartouche name remains illegible. At least the second (lower) hieroglyph can be identified as a Ka- symbol, thus making the king's name a ...ka.Miroslav Verner: Archaeological Remarks on the 4th and 5th Dynasty Chronology. In: Archiv Orientální, Vol. 69. Prag 2001, p. 363–418. The temporally next possible source appears in the famous Westcar Papyrus of the 13th Dynasty. The text mentions a king's son, Bau-ef-Ra. Scholars wonder if this Bauefre may be identical with Bikheris. A very similar name from the New Kingdom period can be found in a rock inscription at Wadi Hammamat. The inscription consists of an honorary prayer surmounted by a short king list. The list contains the names Khufu, Djedefra, Khafra, Djedefhor, and Baefra.  Identifications  Alan B. Lloyd is convinced that the names Baka, Bakare, Baefra, Bauefra and Biuris are all identical to Manetho's Bikheris. This, in turn, is doubted by Kim Ryholt, who points out that the names Baefra and Bauefra contain no syllable that would phonetically fit to \\"Bikheris\\". Thus, Ba(u)efra and Bikheris might be two different kings.K. S. B. Ryholt, Adam Bülow-Jacobsen: The Political Situation in Egypt During the Second Intermediate Period, c. 1800 – 1550 B.C (= CNI publications, Carsten Niebuhr Institut København, vol. 20). Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, , p. 17-18. This view is strengthened by the fact that Bauefra is entitled in contemporary documents only as \\"king's son\\", which is the title of a prince, not that of a ruler. The only Old Kingdom name that could indeed fit is the now incomplete name X-ka, as found at Zawyet el'Aryan. According to Peter Jánosi, the mysterious name could be a Baka, written with a ram symbol. A son of Djedefra was actually named Baka, his name was indeed written with a ram- and a ka-symbol. It might be possible that prince Baka was meant to become king on the royal throne, but then he died unexpectedly during his coronation year, leaving an unfinished tomb shaft. Maybe Baka changed his name from \\"Baka\\" into \\"Baka-Re\\" after his coronation, or perhaps it was done posthumously. If the theory is correct, Bikheris was the hellenized variant of Baka(re).George Andrew Reisner: A History of the Giza Necropolis, Vol. I. Harvard University Press, Harvard 1942, p. 28.  Historical figure  Some scholars suspect that the line of throne successions during the 4th Dynasty of Egypt may have been much less smooth than mainstream Egyptologists believe. In support of this, they point out that it was already suspicious that king Djedefra broke with the family tradition of building royal tombs at Giza. In fact, Djedefra had left the Giza necropolis in an attempt to found a new royal cemetery at Abu Rawash instead. Alan B. Lloyd also points out that Djedefra dared another break with royal traditions by introducing the cult of Ra and placing Ra over all other deities. If Djedefra broke with family traditions, then Bikheris, as his son, may have done the same thing. This, and the obviously very short reign, may have led to Bikheris' exclusion from official records.Peter Jánosi: Giza in der 4. Dynastie. Die Baugeschichte und Belegung einer Nekropole des Alten Reiches. Bd. I: Die Mastabas der Kernfriedhöfe und die Felsgräber. Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 2005, , p. 64-65. Another problem is how later historians depict the 4th Dynasty: Manetho and Eratosthenes both describe Bikheris as the sixth ruler of the 4th Dynasty and as the son and successor of king Djedefra. However, both authors chronologically misplace the kings completely since they give the succession Snofru → Khufu → Khafra → Menkaura → Djedefra → Shepseskaf → Thamphthis; archaeological records however give the correct succession Snofru → Khufu → Djedefra → Khafra → Menkaura → Shepseskaf. The reason for the numerous misplacements of kings in Hellenistic documents may be caused by the ancient authors' erroneous idea that the three builders of the Giza pyramids (Khufu, Khafra and Menkaura) automatically must have been direct throne successors. Also, the Hellenistic authors seem to have built the king list on the historical importance of each king: first the \\"famous pyramid builders\\" everyone knew at their time (because of their still practiced mortuary cults and their impressive monuments), then the \\"lesser important\\" followers. Thus, most scholars are convinced that Bikheris, should he have existed, must have ruled either between Djedefra and Khafra, or between Khafra and Menkaura. Since Bikheris is described as the son and follower of Djedefra, a chronological position between Djedefra and Khafra seems possible. However, the Ramesside king lists provide evidence for placing Bikheris' reign between Khafra and Menkaura. The Saqqara king list provides a very odd sequence of succeeding kings for the 4th Dynasty: after king Khafra, the cartouches from him up to king Userkaf (the first ruler of the 5th Dynasty) are destroyed and thus illegible today. But their number is puzzling, since between Khafra and Userkaf only two kings are archaeologically detected: Menkaura and Shepseskaf. On the other hand, the Saqqara king list gives five cartouches between Khafra and Userkaf: Khafra → ??? → (Menkaura) → (Shepseskaf) → (Thamphthis) → ??? → Userkaf. One was possibly preserved for Bikheris, whilst the second may have been reserved for a king Thamphthis. The third cartouche (the one before Userkaf) remains a mystery. Jürgen von Beckerath proposes king Nyuserre as the holder of the third cartouche; he thinks it is possible that Nyuserre was simply misplaced to the beginning of the 5th Dynasty. The Saqqara king list would therefore give the following succession: Khafra → Bikheris → Menkaura → Shepseskaf → Thamphthis → Nyuserrê → Userkaf. The Royal Canon of Turin also provides an unusual sequence: after king Khafra, the papyrus on which the king list was written is damaged, and only a few year notes have survived. According to the numbers of preserved year notes, between Khafra and Menkaura a further king must have been listed, because an additional line starts with \\"king of Upper- and Lower Egypt\\" (the year notes here are damaged and illegible, though). The following year note about \\"18 years of rulership\\" must belong to king Menkaura. After Menkaura, 4 years of rulership are mentioned, this line was surely reserved for king Shepseskaf. After Shepseskaf, however, a further, additional year note gives \\"2 years of rulership\\" before starting the 5th Dynasty with Userkaf. Egyptologists think that the gap between Khafra and Menkaura once named either Bauefra or Bikheris and the gap between Shepseskaf and Userkaf may have mentioned Thamphthis.  Reign  The length of Bikheris' reign is subject to some dispute. Manetho credits Bikheris with 22 years of rulership, Eratosthenes gives Biuris 10 years and the Royal Canon of Turin provides 2 years. Modern Egyptologists and historians believe Manetho's and Eratosthenes' year numbers to be exaggerations or misinterpretations. They credit Bikheris with a reign of either 2 years (likewise to the Turin Canon) or even less than one year (as Peter Jánosi suggests). Such a short reign would explain why Bikheris left virtually no monuments and/or documents.  Burial  The tomb of Bikheris is unknown. If he is indeed identical to the archaeologically attested prince Baka, he might have been buried in the Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet el'Aryan. This tomb was left unfinished right after the foundation was completed--only an oval-shaped, imbedded sarcophagus was found. The condition of the tomb suggests the sudden death of the king, which forced the tomb workers to leave the necropolis behind. The unfinished tomb would therefore fit well to a supposed short-lived ruler such as Bikheris.

Process  After the cakalang (Minahasan for skipjack tuna) fish has been cleaned (scaled and gutted), the flesh of cakalang is split into two parts and clipped upon a bamboo frame that has been prepared previously. Then the fish meat is cured using soda powder, salt and some spices for flavouring. The cakalang meat later undergoes the smoking process, the heat of fire and smoke must be evenly distributed so that all parts of fish are exposed to the heat, done and dried. The tuna meat curing process takes about four hours and the time needed for cooling is about two hours. The process goes on until the color of skipjack tuna turns reddish and the meat texture is rather dry and not watery. Bamboo frame used in smoking. If processed correctly, cakalang fufu could last for a month, thus can be distributed throughout Indonesia as processed seafood. In North Sulawesi, cakalang fufu is a popular dish and often bought by travellers as gifts. Although it is well known throughout Eastern Indonesia, the main production center more precisely is the fishing town of Bitung, North Sulawesi. Cakalang fufu can be heated or fried and directly consumed with steamed rice accompanied with dabu-dabu (Minahasan sambal), or become the ingredient of other dishes, such as mixed with potato salad, sprinkled upon noodles or tinutuan, or cooked as spicy rica-rica with chili pepper. It has a strong smoky flavor, thanks to being cooked over burning coconut husks. Product distribution Cakalang fufu products can be found in major cities across Indonesia. A common problem for local producers of cakalang fufu is raising the capital necessary to expand production. To solve this problem the Ministry of Industry (Indonesia) provides concessional loans (soft loans) through local governments. Local governments also participate in fairs and festivals to increase public awareness of cakalang fufu.

It seeks to promote ecologically, socially or economically responsible business by engaging companies, economic regulation and public discussion. Behind Finnwatch there are Finnish development and environment organisations and trade unions. The member organisations of Finnwatch are: Service Centre for Development Cooperation (KEPA), Trade Union Solidarity Centre of Finland (SASK), Friends of the Earth Finland, Finn Church Aid, Attac Finland, Pro Ethical Trade and Kehys. The organisation monitors the impacts of business actions of Finnish or strongly Finnish-related companies in developing countries. Based on its research Finnwatch contributes to public discussion and seeks to influence on Finnish and EU corporate responsibility policy. Finnwatch started operating November 1, 2002, as a cooperation project of some civic organisations and trade unions. In 2009 Finnwatch was registered as a separate association and started operating independently in autumn 2010. Finnwatch's actions are guided by a board and its president Pekka Ihalainen. The executive director of the organisation is Sonja Vartiala. Finnwatch works in close collaboration with Swedwatch in Sweden, Norwatch in Norway and DanWatch in Denmark since many companies are owned jointly by many Nordic countries. Finnwatch participates in an EU-funded project called makeITfair on consumer electronics.  Andy Hall  British human rights defender and migrant worker expert Andy Hall conducted a research in Thailand on pineapple concentrate producer Natural Fruit by the order of Finnwatch. There was a report published on the research in January 2013. After that Natural Fruit sued Hall claiming financial losses and slander. On 20 September 2016 Hall was found guilty of criminal defamation and violation of Thailand's Computer Crimes Act. The court sentenced Hall to prison for four years and ordered him to pay a 150,000 baht fine. His prison sentence was reduced to three years and suspended for two years because of his record as a human rights defender. Hall will appeal the ruling.  Publications  Finnwatch publish reports that are freely available (in Finnish: julkaisut). Main language is Finnish. When the publication is written in cooperation with foreign organizations, it may be available in the other national language Swedish or foreign languages like English. In case of wider interest and available finance reports can be translated.  Reports in English  The following Finnwatch reports can be found fully translated into English. = From Congo with blood = The escalation of violation in Congo exacerbates the problem of conflict mineral. Securing human rights in the middle of the conflict isn't easy.

Cloth producers in Bangladesh include H&M;, Zara, Wal- Mart, and Tesco.Bangladeshin vaatetehtaissa naiset raatavat kurjuudessa HS 5.5.2012 B10 = Meat from Brazil = About 20% of the rainforest in Brazil has already been destroyed. Brazil is among the largest meat importers in chicken and beef. Concerns include the deforestation of Amazon, and work conditions. The International Union of Food IUF strives to improve the work conditions and to reduce the risk of work related illnesses in Brazil. A Finn eats 74 kg meat annually in average. World average is 42 kg. In 2009 & 2010 imported meat from Brazil to Finland was 5.4 million kg, i.e. only one kg pro person used in restaurants and industry. In 2010 Brazil produced 9.3 million t (M t) beef with import 1.9M t, 11.4 M t chicken with import 3.3 M t. The production of beef increased 45% during 1997–2010 (from 6.4 to 9.3 Mt) The value of import of chicken increased 17% from 2009 to 2010 $6.8 billion in total. Soy bean cultivation and cattle raising are the key reasons for Amazon deforestation since 1990. Area of UK has been lost. The Sustainable Beef Working Group started in 2007 among WWF, JBS, Marfrig and Carrefour. Swedwatch found out that Sweden imported 42 000 beef from Amazon area in 2010 that were at worst 90-100% responsible for Amazon deforestation. Greenpeace have pointed out JBS in town Barra do Garças in Mato Grosso as one major contributor in the deforestation. North Trade has made commerce with JBS. Here in Sweden operating North Trade gave the responsibility policy and the list of meat origin. HKScan Swedish partner Annerstedt Flodin imported in 2008 6659 beef raised in expense of the Amazon rainforest. It claimed control impossible. The major Brazilian meat importer STC-Meat did not answer the questionnaire. Inex Partners and Meira Nova gave producers, but Kesko did not. Many importers claimed conducting audits but data was not public to confirm the results. Finnwatch recommends for the companies to establish ethical codes and to control the work, health and environment issues. = Coal in Finland = In the coal mines have been reported severe safety, environment or human rights defeats. Finnwatch reported that Finnish companies did not control well their origin of coal. Most coal was used by Pohjolan Voima, Fortum, Helsingin Energia and Rautaruukki. During 2007–2009 coal import was 18.3 million t from 72.5% Russia, US 7.3%, Canada 6.6%, Australia 5.9%, Poland 3.0%, South Africa 1.4%, Columbia 1.3% and Indonesia 1.1%. The majority of coal was from Russia from areas with severe accidents. Finland imported coal from countries that had not ratified the ILO agreement of the health and safety in mines in 2010. Non ratifiers were Russia, Canada, Australia, Columbia, Kazakhstan, Indonesia and China.Coal from the East and the South - Responsibility in Energy Company Coal Purchases http://finnwatch.org/images/Kivihiili_EN_web.pdf FinnWatch 5/2010 (27.9.2010) Energy business has high corruption risk.

It is situated in St Peter's Square in the city centre.  Elisabeth House  The previous building on the site was the concrete Elisabeth House, an office block which was built in 1960 and had weathered badly. It was originally meant to be clad in stone to keep with its context but for financial reasons the exposed concrete was not clad. It used to house the Dutch Pancake House, which opened in the 1970s and closed in the early 2000s. Demolition of Elisabeth House began in late 2011 and the building was fully removed by April 2012.  New building  Construction of the new building was first proposed in 2009, and was granted planning permission in 2010. The scheme was approved in July 2011, and a 25% pre-let of the building by professional services firm KPMG enabled construction to begin. One St Peter's consists of of Grade A office space. Construction began in May 2012 and was due to be completed in early 2014 to coincide with completion of the Central Library and Town Hall redevelopment. It then underwent internal fit out and was completed in late 2014. Concern over the building's height surfaced during the construction of the core. One local observer said the building \\"is at least four storeys too tall on the site and the lift core alone makes the neighbours cower\\". The building fronts onto Midland Hotel, Central Library and Town Hall Extension – all Grade II* listed buildings. The columns supporting the building are on the outside, thus avoiding unwelcome columns in the office space. The exterior columns are clad in limestone rather than concrete. The choice of limestone was exacerbated by the need to remain in context with listed buildings in the vicinity and the desire to avoid weathering which is often seen in concrete. A three-storey glazed balcony tops the building and features a curved, overhanging roof complete with spotlights. Situated in Manchester's historic district, the building needed to meet strict conservation area rules. One St Peter's was designed in a simple modern classical style with high quality Jura limestone columns to fit in with the Central Library opposite. A sweeping top floor balcony perches out over St Peter's Square, providing a focal point for passers-by. The new building forms part of the new civic space for St. Peter's Square. As part of the plans, the Central Library and Town Hall Extension were renovated (a process which began in 2010 and was completed in 2014) and the landscaping of the square with trees. Three further high-rise office blocks are proposed adjacent to One St Peter's; the completed 12-storey building known as Two St Peter's Square), a 14-storey building named Landmark on the site of the former Odeon cinema, and an 11-storey block to the east (known as 3 St Peter's Square).  Occupancy  Oxford Street, August 2014 In May 2014, it was reported that the restaurant chain San Carlo is set to open its fifth Manchester venue, launching a restaurant in One St Peter’s Square in late October-early November 2014. As of February 2015, approximately 40% of the floorspace has been leased. KPMG confirmed in July 2014 that it was taking an additional of office space across half of the 10th floor. They had initially agreed to take across the upper three floors. In December 2014, law firm DLA Piper agreed a 15-year lease for 45,000 sq ft of space on floors eight and nine. The firm will move in mid-2016 once the lease at Barbirolli Square expires. The Greater Manchester Property Venture Fund (GMPVF), part of the Greater Manchester Pension Fund, invested £10 million in the development.

A temporary, but abrupt halt to the income source for the Lindburgh Boom The Lindbergh Boom (1927–1929) is a period of rapid interest in aviation following the awarding of the Orteig Prize to Charles Lindbergh for his 1927 non-stop solo transatlantic flight in the Spirit of St. Louis. The Lindbergh Boom occurred during the interwar period between World War I and World War II, where aviation development was fueled by commercial interests rather than wartime necessity. During this period, dozens of companies were formed to create airlines, and aircraft for a new age in aviation. Many of the fledgling companies funded by stock went under as quick as they started as the stock that capitalized them plummeted in value following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The Great Depression dried up the market for new aircraft, causing many aircraft companies to go into bankruptcy or get consolidated by larger entities. Air racing, record attempts, and barnstorming remained popular, as aviators tried to recapture the prizes and publicity of Lindbergh's Transatlantic flight. The Lindbergh Boom Publicity surrounding Lindbergh and his flight boosted the aviation industry and made a skeptical public take air travel seriously. Within a year of his flight, a quarter of Americans (an estimated thirty million) personally saw Lindbergh and the Spirit of St. Louis. Over the remainder of 1927 applications for pilot's licenses in the U.S. tripled, the number of licensed aircraft quadrupled, and U.S. Airline passengers grew between 1926 and 1929 by 3,000% from 5,782 to 173,405.Diamandis, Peter H. \\"Our Story: The X Prize Heritage.\\" The X-Prize Foundation, 2004. Retrieved: April 26, 2008. Contributing factors Lindbergh's flight was the peak of several other factors that lead to the boom. This included: * movie reels and newspaper- funded record attempts for publicity * the introduction of reliable, high- power-to-weight engines, such as the Wright Whirlwind * the exhaustion of World War I-vintage aircraft engines and airframes * the start of contract air mail routes in the United States, which subsidized new airline service * the introduction of all-metal airliners like the Ford Trimotor that could carry enough revenue passengers to be profitable * the completion of the lighted airway * publicity events such as the National Air Races, and the nationwide Ford National Reliability Air Tour * airplane service and cargo flights to the Caribbean to skirt the Volstead Act * an influx of capital from a booming stock market.

The other medications used in combination include sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and interferon, vary depending on the virus type and whether the person has cirrhosis. It is taken by mouth once a day. Common side effects with sofusbivir and daclatasvir include headache, feeling tired, and nausea. With daclatasvir, sofusbivir, and ribavirin the most common side effects are headache, feeling tired, nausea, and red blood cell breakdown. It should not be used with St. John's wort, rifampin, or carbamazepine. It works by inhibiting the HCV protein NS5A. Daclatasvir was approved for use in the European Union in 2014, and the United States and India in 2015. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. As of January 2016 a twelve-week course cost around $63,000 in the United States, $39,000 in the United Kingdom, $37,000 in France, and $525 in Egypt. The brand Daklinza is being withdrawn by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) in various countries and BMS will let the patents lapse in those countries.  Medical use  Daclatasvir is used only in combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis C genotype 1, 3, or 4 infections; the agents used in combination, which include sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and interferon, vary based on the virus genotype and whether the person has cirrhosis. It is not known whether daclatasvir passes into breastmilk or has any effect on infants.  Adverse effects  There is a serious risk of bradycardia when daclatasvir is used with sofosbuvir and amiodarone Because it has not been extensively studied as a single agent, it is unknown what specific side effects are linked to this medication alone. Adverse events on daclatasvir have only been reported on combination therapy with sofusbivir or triple therapy with sofusbivir/ribavirin. Common adverse events occurring in >5% of people on combination therapy (sofusbivir + daclatasvir) include headache and fatigue; in triple therapy (daclatasvir + sofusbivir + ribavirin) the most common adverse events (>10%) include headache, fatigue, nausea and hemolytic anemia. Daclatasvir could cause hepatitis B re-activation in people co-infected with hepatitis B and C viruses. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended screening all people for hepatitis B before starting daclatasvir for hepatitis C in order to minimize the risk of hepatitis B reactivation.  Interactions  Concomitant use of drugs that are strong inducers of the cytochrome P450 CYP3A is contraindicated due to decreased therapeutic effect and resistance of drug. Some common drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers include dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin and St. John's Wort. Daclatasvir is a CYP3A and p-glycoprotein substrate, therefore, drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of these enzyme will interfere with daclatasvir levels in the body. Dose modifications are made with concomitant use of daclatasvir and drugs that affect CYP3A or p-gp. When taking daclatasvir with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, the dose of daclatasvir is increased to overcome CYP3A induction. The dose for daclatasvir should be lowered when taking with antifungals, such as ketoconazole. Currently, there are no required dosage adjustments with concurrent use of daclatasvir and immunosuppressants, narcotic analgesics, antidepressants, sedatives, and cardiovascular agents. Concurrent use with amiodarone, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir has may result in an increased risk for serious slowing of the heart rate.  Pharmacology = Mechanism of action  Daclatasvir stops HCV viral RNA replication and protein translation by directly inhibiting HCV protein NS5A. NS5A is critical for HCV viral transcription and translation, and as of 2014 it appeared that resistance can arise to daclatasvir fairly swiftly.  Pharmacokinetics  Daclatasvir reaches steady state in human subjects after about 4 days of once- daily 60 mg oral administration, with a peak dose in concentration occurring about 2 hours after administration. It comes in the form of an oral tablet, with a bioavailability of 67%. Daclatasvir is predominantly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and is also a P-gp substrate. It is highly protein bound. Protein binding was measured to be around 99% in people dosed multiple times with daclatasvir independent of dose strength. Daclatasvir has a volume of distribution of 47L following an oral dose of 60 mg and an IV dose of 100 μg. History Daklinza was discovered by scientists at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS); the precursor was identified using phenotypic screening in which the GT-1b replicon system was implemented in Huh7 cells and bovine viral diarrhea virus also in Huh7 cells was used as a counterscreen for specificity. BMS also developed the drug, with the first Phase I trial publishing in 2010. It was approved for use in Europe in August 2014, in the US in July 2015, and in India in December 2015; it was first in the class of NS5A inhibitors to reach the market. Society and culture It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medications needed in a basic health system. In December 2014 BMS announced that it would offer the drug for sale at different prices in different countries, depending on the level of economic development, and that it would license the drug to generics manufacturers for sale in the developing world. As of January 2016 a twelve- week course cost around $63,000 in the US, around $39,000 in the UK, around $37,000 in France, and $525 in Egypt, and by that time BMS had joined the Medicines Patent Pool. Research Daclatasvir has been tested in combination regimens with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, as well as with other direct-acting antiviral agents including asunaprevir and sofosbuvir.

History The Canadian Institute for Historical Microreproductions (CIHM) was launched in 1978 by the Canada Council in keeping with the recommendations of the Commission on Canadian Studies (held by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada). The commission's report, To Know Ourselves, noted several major concerns for the development of Canadian research knowledge: the difficulty accessing Canada's published heritage, unevenly scattered across the country, and the deteriorating condition of material for which no preservation efforts had been made. CIHM launched with the mandate to preserve Canada's older physical collections for future generations. The organization microfilmed materials to preservation standards, storing the masters at Library and Archives Canada and producing copies on microfiche for distribution to Canada's research libraries. By the late 1990s, the CIHM collection was held by 85 libraries and accessed by 100,000 users each year. Canadiana.org initial launch included a 'Discovery Portal' which was a search platform built by harvesting the cataloguing information (metadata) from Canada's major digital libraries. The portal converted each type of metadata into a common format, allowing users to search 60 million pages of digital heritage material held by 33 Canadian research libraries, archives, and museums. One of the largest contributors was the University of Toronto. Described as \\"the Google of Canadian history,\\" the portal broke ranks with most academic search platforms by streamlining its interface to appeal to the lay person. On April 1, 2018, Canadiana.org merged with the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN). CRKN is a not-for-profit partnership of 75 Canadian universities that provides subscription service to early Canadiana online since 2006. As of January 1, 2019, Canadiana.org now provides open and free access to a large collection of full-text historical content about Canada, including books, magazines and government documents. Services Early Canadiana Online (ECO) is a digital repository containing some 60 million pages of historical primary sources catalogued in 10 digital collections. The database was launched in 1999 at the University of Toronto's Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library with material digitized from the CIHM microfiche collection and a search engine developed at the University of Waterloo. The ECO collection initially covered four themes (English Canadian literature, travel and exploration, women's history, history of French Canada, and aboriginal history). The new database organization features three categories: monographs, periodicals, magazines and newspapers; and government publications. Some of the source material includes the digitization of the Jesuit Relations, the Hudson's Bay Company archives, Canada's early Official Publications, early Canadian periodicals, health and medicine journals, and Governors General's papers. Role in the history of hockey In 2003, a Toronto-based hockey historian exploited ECO's search capabilities to trace the sport's origins back two decades earlier (and thousands of kilometers further west) than previously believed. The ECO collection featured a letter from Sir John Franklin's 1825 Arctic expedition containing the first known written reference to a game of hockey played on ice. Addressed to British geologist Roderick Murchison from Fort Franklin on the south shore of the Great Bear Lake, Rupert's Land (present-day North-West Territories), the letter read: Several Canadian cities, including Montreal (whose Montreal Gazette published the first set of hockey rules in 1875), Halifax, and Windsor, claim the distinction of the \\"birthplace of hockey,\\" while similar stick-and-ball games were common (and no doubt occasionally played on ice) to both Europe and North America in the early 19th century. Following the discovery of Franklin's passage on ECO, the town of Deline (site of the original Fort Franklin) officially added its claim.

The property is divided between several locations, with the largest in the towns of Torgiano and Montefalco. Founded in the late 1950s by Giorgio Lungarotti, the company is now headed by his wife Maria Grazia, and sisters Teresa and Chiara. The Lungarotti name is famous for putting Umbrian wines on the map, through a mixture of traditional respect for the land and modern innovation and research. The Lungarotti company also owns the Wine Museum of Torgiano (MUVIT) and the Olive and Oil Museum (MOO), all two located in the center of Torgiano. History The Lungarotti winery as it is known today was born in the late 1950s. Previously renowned for his family's small-production wines, Giorgio Lungarotti decided to transform his vineyard into a larger scale production, guided his love and respect for the land. Giorgio, together with his wife Maria Grazia, was able to tap into the potential of the under-recognized Umbrian Region, creating a high-quality wine with a marriage between technology and tradition. The most important wine for the Lungarotti brand is Rubesco. Named for the Latin verb, \\"to blush\\", it originated from a new way to grow the vine, and a selection of the traditional varietals vinified in a scientific manner. This process was created by Giorgio himself, and is a point of pride for the company.

She is best known for winning The Oaks on her third racecourse appearance. Background Was is a bay filly with a narrow white blaze and white socks on her hind feet, bred by the Lodge Park Stud in County Kilkenny, Ireland. She was sired by the 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo out of the mare Alluring Park, a half-sister of the Derby winner New Approach. In October 2010, the filly was sent to the Tattersalls sales where she was bought for 1,200,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore organisation. The price made her the most expensive European yearling of 2010. Racing career=2011: two- year-old season Was first appeared on a racecourse in a maiden race at the Curragh on 7 August. Ridden by her trainer's son Joseph O'Brien, she won by two and a half lengths from her stable companion, Cabin, and ten other fillies. 2012: three-year-old season Was made her three-year-old debut in the Blue Wind Stakes at Naas on 16 May. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan, she finished third of the six runners behind Princess Highway. On 1 June Was started a 20/1 outsider for the Epsom Oaks, in which O'Brien ran five fillies including Maybe who started second favourite. Was went into the lead from the start but was then settled behind the leaders by Heffernan. She regained the lead two furlongs from the finish and ran on under pressure to win by a neck from Shirocco Star. The filly was expected to run in the Pretty Polly Stakes on 1 July, but was withdrawn (along with Maybe) because of the extremely soft ground. In the Irish Oaks three weeks later, Was appeared to be badly hampered in the straight before finishing fourth, beaten more than five lengths by Great Heavens. In August, Was was brought back in distance for the ten furlong Nassau Stakes at Goodwood, and finished third behind The Fugue and Timepiece. Later that month she finished third to Shareta and The Fugue in the Yorkshire Oaks. On her final appearance of the year she finished unplaced behind Sapphire in the British Champions Fillies' and Mares' Stakes. 2013: four- year-old season Was began her third season in the Abu Dhabi Stakes over one mile at the Curragh on 25 May. Ridden by Joseph O'Brien she started at odds of 11/2 and finished fourth of the eight runners behind Chigun. On 30 June Was started 5/2 favourite for the Pretty Polly Stakes and finished second, half a length behind the winner Ambivalent and a neck ahead of Shirocco Star. Breeding career Was retired from racing in 2014 and was bred to War Front, to whom she produced the filly Darkness Falls in January 2015 and the colts Globe Theatre (2016) and Knight of Malta (2017).

The trilogy is centered on Sophie Mercer, a sixteen-year-old witch who is sent to Hecate Hall (nicknamed \\"Hex Hall\\"), a boarding school for magical beings, after a string of disastrous spells gone wrong. While there, she gets caught up in the ongoing war between the Prodigium and the human organizations who seek to eradicate them from the world. Overview The trilogy follows the exploits of Sophie Mercer, a young witch, who is sent to Hecate Hall (\\"Hex Hall\\"), a boarding school for Prodigium juvenile delinquents. An awkward, sarcastic girl, she becomes best friends with her vampire roommate, Jenna Talbot, who is an outcast like her. Sophie also gets swept up in a love triangle involving Archer, the school's resident bad boy, and Cal, her betrothed. Through a series of events, Sophie gets caught up in the secret war going on between the Prodigium and a group of humans who believe the Prodigium should be destroyed. As the trilogy progresses, Sophie discovers more about herself, powers, and the mystery behind her family's origins. Along with all of this she also meets an enemy Characters Hex Hall has a large supporting cast of characters, whose plot significance varies by book. Major Characters Sophia 'Sophie' Mercer/Atherton/Brannick :The narrator of the trilogy, who was sent to live at Hex Hall after a string of spells went disastrously wrong. After Sophie's mother discovered that her father was a warlock, they split up and Sophie lived solely with her mother. In order to keep Sophie a secret from her mother's family, the two were forced to move quite frequently. Upon attending Hex Hall, Sophie became close friends with her roommate, Jenna Talbot, the school's outcast. She finds herself caught up in a love triangle between Archer Cross and Alexander Callahan. Sarcastic, clumsy, and lazy, Sophie struggles to control her powers and avoid succumbing to her true nature as a demon. Jennifer 'Jenna' Talbot :Sophie's best friend and roommate. A lesbian girl, Jenna was bitten by a vampire girl who she had fallen in love with who was later killed by The Eye. Lonely, snarky and guarded, Jenna is an outcast at Hex Hall due to her inherently violent nature as a vampire. She exhibits most powers generally associated with vampires such as heightened agility and strength. She wears a bloodstone -- a magical stone filled with the blood of a witch or wizard -- to control her vampire weaknesses (sunlight, garlic, etc.). For a short while she is sent to be questioned by the Prodigium Council, after being suspected of murdering two classmates. It is there she meets and falls in love with Vix, another vampire. Although she finds a home in a vampire coven, she believes her true place is with Sophie. Archer Cross :A young, powerful warlock and Hex Hall's resident bad boy. While at first he frequently mocks Sophie due to her clumsiness and weak ability with magic, over time he comes to befriend and eventually fall in love with her. However, it is revealed that Archer is a member of The Eye (an organization that wants to kill all Prodigium), having been adopted by them as a child in order to help them fight the Prodigium. He was given the name Archer Cross after another warlock of the Eye. He feels conflicted over his family loyalty to The Eye and to Sophie. He is shunned from the Prodigium world and seen as a hostile enemy due to his association with The Eye, but does leave The Eye at the end of the series. It is later revealed that his real name is Daniel Anderson. His parents were killed by his uncle, and his cousin (Nick) who had been born a demon had tried to kill him not once, but twice. Alexander 'Cal' Callahan :The groundskeeper of Hex Hall. He is betrothed to Sophie, and is in love with her. He is an extremely powerful white warlock, and has the unique ability to heal. He was sent to Hex Hall when he was thirteen when he healed someone and has lived there ever since. To Cal, Hex Hall is his home.

Novels=Hex Hall The story introduces Sophie Mercer as a witch who is ordered to attend school at Hex Hall after a long series of unfortunate spells that threaten to reveal the Prodigium world to the general human population, the spell that sent her to Hex Hall was a love spell that worked way too well. Reluctant, stubborn, and sarcastic, Sophie finds herself at odds with many people at Hex Hall, including a coven of dark witches and popular warlock Archer Cross. She becomes good friends with her vampire roommate, Jenna Talbot, despite the fact that Jenna was suspected the year before of murdering a classmate. As Sophie attempts to adapt to this new world and learning to control her powers, the school is thrown into chaos after two other students are found attacked, drained of nearly all their blood. Jenna is again suspected of the attacks and is sent away for interrogation, despite Sophie's attempts to clear her best friend's name. Meanwhile, Sophie's great-grandmother, Alice, appears and extends the offer to help Sophie with her magic. Grateful for the help, Sophie is shocked to discover that she is much more powerful than she initially believed. After getting in trouble with a teacher, Sophie is forced to spend time with Archer; the two fall in love, but Sophie is dismayed upon learning Archer is a member of The Eye, an Italian-based organization seeking to exterminate the Prodigium population, as they believe they are evil demons. Her life is thrown into further turmoil upon the discovery that her great- grandmother, Alice, is actually a demon who is responsible for the deaths at Hex Hall who was raised by the dark coven to help Prodigium defeat The Eye. Sophie ends up killing Alice with a special sword made of demonglass (a rare substance only found in hell), and learns that since she has demon blood, she could revert to demon nature and kill someone she loves, as did her grandmother, killing her grandfather. Sophie decides to go to London, and go through the Removal, which will take away her demon side. Demonglass After learning that she is not a witch but in fact a demon, Sophie requests to go through a process known as The Removal. Her father who's actually the head of The Council, James Artherton, denies her request, persuading her to visit him in London at Thorne Abbey over the summer to learn to control her powers. She agrees to his proposal and travels to England with Jenna and Cal. Upon arriving, she meets the remaining members of The Council as well as two children, Nick and Daisy, who had been turned into demons. Sophie and her father begin to work on mastering her powers, culminating in Sophie helping her father steal an ancient spell book they believe will help them turn Nick and Daisy human once again. However, they discover the relevant pages in the book have been removed. Feeling neglected by and resentful of Jenna, who is enamored with her new girlfriend and desires to move away and join a vampire coven, Sophie begins to bond with Cal and attempts to befriend Nick and Daisy. While at a Prodigium night club, Sophie and the others narrowly escape an attack by The Eye, who are looking for Sophie. Among the members of the attack is Archer, who secretly gives Sophie a magical coin she can use to communicate with him. Sophie ignores Archer's repeated attempts to talk to her, though later gives in when Archer attends her birthday party in disguise. After Sophie is attacked at the party, she and Archer use a portal called an Itineris to travel to Hex Hall, where they are attacked by humans that were used to be turned in to demons also known as ghouls. Upon returning to England, Sophie confesses everything to her father, including the fact that she suspects the Casnoffs (the headmistress of Hex Hall and part of the Council) to be behind Nick and Daisy's demon transformations. Elodie, who was previously murdered by Sophie's great-grandmother, appears as a ghost to warn Sophie of Archer being attacked by Nick. Sophie convinces Cal to heal Archer, who is immediately imprisoned by Sophie's father. The next day, Sophie is sentenced to go through the Removal, and her powers are rendered useless. The Casnoffs' reveal they were indeed behind the demon raisings and subsequently force Sophie's father to go through the Removal as well. However, before Sophie is stripped completely of her powers, The Eye attacks Thorne Abbey, allowing Sophie to escape. Cal instructs Sophie to use the Itineris to go to her mother, who is currently staying with the Brannicks, one of the enemies of the Prodigium, and he kisses her. The novel ends as Sophie steps through the doorway. Spell Bound Sophie arrives at the homestead of the Brannicks, an ancient female clan that has been at war with the Prodigium, whose numbers are now dwindling. After being reunited, Sophie's mother explains that she was born into the Brannick's clan, but chose not to fight in the war against the Prodigium. At first wary of one another, Sophie and the Brannicks slowly begin to warm to each other. Meanwhile, Sophie reluctantly finds herself a companion in Elodie, and the two discover that Sophie is able to tap into her powers while Elodie is inhabiting her body. After some time, Jenna and Archer manage to find Sophie, though almost immediately they are transported back to Hex Hall via a spell cast by the Casnoffs, who are using the school to imprison all of the recent Prodigium students. The Casnoffs plan on raising demons through the students, experimenting on which type of Prodigium will adapt best to the spell. While imprisoned at Hex Hall, the students—particularly Archer—undergo both physical and mental torture orchestrated by the Casnoffs. Meanwhile, Sophie finds herself conflicted between her love for both Cal and Archer, which is complicated by Elodie's intruding. Sophie and the others learn of the Casnoffs ultimate plan, which is to raise an army of demons in a misguided attempt to protect the Prodigium from humans. Sophie and the others manage to escape Hex Hall through the Itineris after Sophie manages to regain her powers through sheer, desperate willpower. Sophie is reunited with her parents and the Brannicks, who explain they cannot defeat the demons that have been raised without the help of demonglass; Sophie, Jenna, Archer, and Cal journey to the Underworld to retrieve it, where they are forced to witness memories related to their tragic pasts. Sophie vows to kill the Casnoffs and break the demon spells, returning the Prodigium to their true forms. A battle breaks out between the Casnoffs and Sophie's group. At first outnumbered, Archer manages to persuade a sect of The Eye to join in on the battle, in an attempt to help defeat a common enemy. Sophie and the others manage to defeat the Casnoffs and break the spell, however, Cal dies after sacrificing himself to save Sophie. In the subsequent aftermath of the battle, Sophie is called into a meeting with The Council, who offer her the position of Council Head, after witnessing her demonstrations of leadership and power in the fight against the Casnoffs. Sophie agrees to consider the offer, but explains that she would prefer to finish school first. In Cal's honor, Sophie requests that Hex Hall be re-opened, this time as a regular school for Prodigium students, and the Council acquiesces. Sophie releases her bond on Elodie, who is happily bound to Hex Hall. She joins a ghostly Cal for a walk on the grounds. Jenna and Archer return with Sophie to Hex Hall, explaining that they would prefer to stay with Sophie than to go off on their own, and Sophie realizes that she has finally found happiness. Spin-off novel In March 2012, Rachel Hawkins announced on her book tour that she was currently writing a spin-off novel, with the book due to be published by Hyperion in 2013. This was later confirmed by Hawkins on her Livejournal, stating that the series was still untitled. Hawkins has hinted that it will focus on Izzy Brannick, who appeared in Spell Bound. It was later confirmed that book's name is School Spirits with a cover reveal on 19 November 2012. School Spirits School Spirits (published 2013), follows a new main character: Sophie's cousin Isolde 'Izzy\\" Brannick, after Izzy's sister Finley disappears mysteriously. Because of this, Izzy's mom enrolls her in a small town high school to go undercover for a new case. Izzy suspects that this is actually because her mother wants her to have a semblance of normal life, but she plays along, and prepares for her new life by binge-watching many high school drama shows with Torin, who she talks to regularly both through mirrors and in dreams, which he regularly brings her into. Izzy befriends students Anderson, Romy, and Dex, and after the paranormal mystery is solved, Dex leaves with her and her mom to go on a new case. No new books have been confirmed.
