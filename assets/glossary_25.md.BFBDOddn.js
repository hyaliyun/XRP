It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in the Hoo peninsula, north of Rochester, with only marshland to the north between it and the River Thames. History The church originates from the 13th century, with its building continuing into the following century. The upper part of the tower was added later, and was completed by about 1400. The church was restored in the 19th century, when a vestry was added, and the porch was rebuilt. It was declared redundant on 19 November 1976 and vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 31 May 1978. It is now cared for by a group known as the Friends of St James' Church. The church is open daily to visitors. The churchyard provided the inspiration for the opening chapter of Charles Dickens' book Great Expectations, in which the hero of the story, Pip, meets the convict, Magwitch. In 2005 the musician Jools Holland married the sculptor Christabel McEwan in the church. Architecture St James' is constructed in a variety of stone, including ragstone, flint and chalk, with some repairs in sandstone. The roofs are tiled. Its plan consists of a nave with a south porch, a chancel with a south vestry, and a west tower. The windows in the nave date from the early 14th century, and those in the chancel from the 15th century. The north doorway is blocked, but its 500-year-old timber door is still present, and still swings on its hinges. In the chancel are a triple sedilia and a double piscina. The font dates from the 13th century, and consists of a square bowl supported by five piers. The pulpit dates from the 18th century. At the west end of the church are six benches that probably date from the 14th century; the others were replaced in 1869. There are four memorial slabs in the floor of the nave. One of these is dated 1611. Another is to the memory of Feyth Brook, who died in 1508. She was the wife of Thomas Brook, Lord Cobham, who lived in Cooling Castle. The interior of the vestry is completely lined with cockle shells, the emblem of Saint James. The stained glass in the east window dates from 1897; it depicts the Ascension, and was made by Clayton and Bell. The single-manual organ was probably made in about 1880 by A. Kirkland. There are three bells, all dating from the 17th century, but they are not ringable. The tenor bears the inscription \\"MICHAEL DARBIE MADE ME 1651\\" and is estimated to be . According to an inspection in 2004 by Peter Romney the frame appears to be medieval. The fittings may be from 1675, the date of the youngest bell. Although fitted with full wheels, Romney thinks that the bells were never rung full circle, based on the absence of stays and the incorrect location of the ground pulleys. It is possible that the bells are recasts of earlier bells, but it is also possible that the apparently medieval frame may itself be a 17th-century copy. External features In the churchyard is a chest tomb dating from the early or middle part of the 18th century. It is designated as a Grade II listed building. Also in the churchyard is a row of 13 children's gravestones, measuring about long; these have come to be known as \\"Pip's Graves\\".

The ship was named after the Prussian statesman Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein. She was the sixth member of the class, which included five other vessels. The Bismarck-class corvettes were ordered as part of a major naval construction program in the early 1870s, and she was designed to serve as a fleet scout and on extended tours in Germany's colonial empire. Stein was laid down in 1878, launched in September 1879, and was commissioned into the fleet in October 1880. She was armed with a battery of twelve guns and had a full ship rig to supplement her steam engine on long cruises abroad. Stein served almost her entire career as a training ship; her only non- training task came early in her career when she carried a replacement crew to Chinese waters for her sister ship in 1883‚Äì1884. The rest of her time in service was spent training naval cadets and apprentice seamen and participating in squadron and fleet training exercises. Her training duties frequently involved long-distance overseas cruises, typically either to the Mediterranean Sea or the West Indies and South America. On these cruises, Stein and other training ships visited foreign ports and responded to problems that arose involving German nationals abroad. She served in this role from 1885 to 1908, when she was stricken from the naval register and converted into a barracks ship. She continued on in this limited capacity through World War I, before being broken up in 1920. Design The six ships of the Bismarck class were ordered in the early 1870s to supplement Germany's fleet of cruising warships, which at that time relied on several ships that were twenty years old. Stein and her sister ships were intended to patrol Germany's colonial empire and safeguard German economic interests around the world. Stein was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 18 officers and 386 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove one 2-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . As built, Stein was equipped with a full ship rig, but this was later reduced. Stein was armed with a battery of twelve 22-caliber (cal.) breech-loading guns, though these were later partially replaced with quick-firing guns, and two 30-cal. guns. She also carried six Hotchkiss revolver cannon. Service history =Construction= The keel for Stein, the last member of the Bismarck class, was laid down in 1878 at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin. Construction began under the contract name Ersatz , and at her launching on 14 September 1879, was christened Stein in honor of Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein by Kaiser Wilhelm I. While she was being towed from Stettin to Kiel, she struck an uncharted reef off Prerow, though she was undamaged in the accident. On 23 May 1880 the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel began the process of equipping and arming the ship, and on 21 October she was commissioned for sea trials, though they were temporarily halted on 23 December, when the ship was decommissioned for the winter. She returned to service on 15 March 1881 for additional trials, which lasted until 30 April. She was then placed in reserve, and on 23 May 1882, Stein was transferred to Wilhelmshaven. =1883‚Äì1888= Stein in service as a training ship At the time, the standard German practice was to charter civilian ships to bring replacement crews to warships stationed abroad, but none were available for this purpose, so Stein was commissioned on 1 July 1883 for this purpose. She left Wilhelmshaven on 16 July, bound for Hong Kong, where she met her sister ship on 4 November. After exchanging crews, she began the voyage back to Germany on 10 November and arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 6 January 1884, where she was decommissioned eleven days later. This stint in reserve lasted more than a year, and on 14 April 1885 she was recommissioned as a training ship for four-year volunteers. From then to mid-July, she was occupied with training cruises in the North and Baltic Seas, at which point she joined the Training Squadron as the flagship of Konteradmiral (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Louis von Blanc. She participated in the annual fleet maneuvers in August and September, which featured simulated attacks on the bases at Kiel and Wilhelmshaven. The German navy generally deactivated its ships over the winter months, but a series of accidents during the summer maneuvers convinced the naval command to form a training squadron after the conclusion of the exercises on 23 September. Stein served as the flagship of the unit, which also included her sister and the corvettes and . The four ships cruised to the West Indies, leaving Wilhelmshaven on 11 October. They stopped in Cape Verde on 13 November, where they remained for two weeks owing to tensions with Spain over the Caroline Islands and the departure of the German East Africa Squadron. The conflict with Spain was resolved by 30 November, allowing the ships to continue on to the Caribbean, where they toured ports in the region. They left in early 1886 and arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 27 March, where the squadron was dissolved three days later. Stein then went into the shipyard in Wilhelmshaven for repairs before resuming training ship duties on 3 May. The Training Squadron was reformed on 19 July, with Stein again the flagship; she and Moltke were joined by the corvettes and and the ironclad . The unit conducted exercises in the Baltic, followed by the annual maneuvers with the rest of the fleet in August and September. The winter training cruise to the West Indies began on 14 October, though without Hansa; while the ships were in Lisbon en route to their destination, Sophie was detached to reinforce German forces in West African waters. After arriving in the Caribbean, the Training Squadron was joined by the corvette . Tensions with France forced the squadron to return home prematurely on 3 February 1887, and they used a route to the north of Great Britain to avoid contact with French warships. By the time the squadron had reached the coast of Ireland on 11 March, the situation had calmed, though they were still instructed to return to Germany. While in Southampton, they joined the celebration for Wilhelm I's 90th birthday on 22 March. The ships reached Wilhelmshaven on 30 March and the squadron was again disbanded on 4 April. The rest of 1887 followed a similar pattern to previous years. After completing periodic maintenance to the ships, the Training Squadron was again reformed under the command of KAdm Philipp von Kall with Stein as flagship and also including her sister , Moltke, and Prinz Adalbert. Their routine was interrupted by a ceremony for the beginning of construction on the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in June. On 1 October, the winter training cruise began, though this year the ships went to the Mediterranean Sea. While in Naples on 19 November, Stein caught fire, though the fire was quickly suppressed by her crew, with help from Prinz Adalbert and men from the Italian corvette . While Stein was being repaired, Kall transferred his flag to Gneisenau from 19 November to 8 January 1888. On 13 March, the ships began the voyage back to Germany, and while en route visited Madeira and S√£o Vicente, Cape Verde before arriving back in Wilhelmshaven on 10 April. Five days later, the squadron was again dissolved, only to be reformed on 5 May. =1888‚Äì1897= A painting of Stein, , and under sail, by Alexander Kircher The typical summer training program was interrupted by a visit of Kaiser Wilhelm II to St. Petersburg, Russia, Stockholm, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark, which the Training Squadron ships accompanied. They then joined the rest of the fleet for the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September; after they concluded, Stein was decommissioned on 20 September for modernization, which included re-boilering, placing some of her guns with new quick-firing weapons, and additional crew spaces that could be used to house up to 50 cadets and 210 Schiffsjungen (apprentice seamen) for training. She was also formally added to the list of training ships at this time. The modernization was a lengthy process, and she was ready for service only on 27 April 1893, when she was recommissioned. Less than a month later, she ran aground off Ekensund on 26 May, though she was able to free herself with no damage. She then visited Stockholm with Stosch; there she was visited by the King of Sweden and Ludwig III of Bavaria. She and Gneisenau took part in the Cowes Regatta in late July and early August in company with Wilhelm II aboard his yacht, Hohenzollern. Stein took part in the autumn maneuvers from 28 August to 23 September, followed by the winter training cruise, which again went to the West Indies and concluded in Kiel on 27 March 1894. While in La Guaira, Venezuela in December 1893, Stein represented Germany at the opening of a German-funded rail line that connected the city to the capital Caracas. After returning to Kiel, Stein went into drydock for repairs, followed by a short voyage to Christiana, Norway in July, to bring Kaiserin Augusta Victoria back to Kiel. The fleet maneuvers then took place, lasting from 19 August to 21 September. Stein again served as the flagship, this time for KAdm August von Thomsen, the commander of II Squadron. Another overhaul followed the maneuvers, and on 2 October, she cruised with Gneisenau to the Mediterranean for the winter training cruise, returning to Germany in early 1895. In May 1895, she and four other training ships cruised in the Baltic, in what was now IV Division, commanded by KAdm Otto von Diederichs. During this period, she also attended the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. In July, she cruised to Helsingfors with Hohenzollern, the ships returning to Kiel on 20 July. Stein then made a visit to Lerwick from 27 July to 14 August, after which she joined the rest of the fleet for the annual maneuvers in the North and Baltic Seas. Stein began the winter cruise earlier than in previous years, on 25 September, this time again visiting the West Indies. Stosch and Gneisenau joined her, and the three ships stopped in Havana, Cuba, where unrest against the Spanish colonial government threatened Germans in the city. In late January 1896, the ships could leave the area, and early the next month Stein went to Caracas to support the German ambassador who was negotiating with the Venezuelan government over payment for the railway opened in December 1893, a classic example of gunboat diplomacy. On 7 February, Stein and the other ships were recalled to Germany, and they arrived in Kiel on 18 February. Stein and Stosch conducted exercises in the Baltic in July, and they visited Kronstadt and St. Petersburg between 8 and 15 July; in the latter city, Czar Nicholas II received the officers of both ships. Stein then continued on alone, visiting Bergen, Norway, before returning to Kiel on 2 August. She joined the fleet maneuvers from 9 August to 15 September, after which she embarked on the winter cruise to the West Indies on 26 September. While in Madeira on the out- bound leg of the cruise, however, the training squadron was diverted to the Mediterranean to respond to unrest in the Ottoman Empire. After stopping in several harbors in the Levant, Stein stayed in Alexandria, Egypt with Moltke and Gneisenau, finally returning to Kiel on 25 March 1897. =1897‚Äì1920= An unidentified member of the class, likely in the 1890s During the fleet maneuvers in August and September 1897, Stein served with the reconnaissance group of the main fleet. On 19 September, Admiral Hans von Koester, the Chief of the Marinestation der Ostsee (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea), came aboard the ship to represent Wilhelm II at a celebration of King Oscar II's 25th year on the throne of Sweden‚ÄìNorway. This delayed the start of the winter training cruise to 2 November. The ships did go to the West Indies this year, and in early December, Stein and Charlotte were sent to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where Haitians had attacked German nationals. The situation was resolved by 14 December, allowing the ships to leave for Germany. While en route, they stopped in Antwerp, where they joined celebrations for the 25th anniversary of Leopold II of Belgium ascending to the throne. Stein reached Kiel on 27 March 1898, where she was decommissioned on 19 April. After Gneisenau was wrecked in bad weather off M√°laga on 16 December 1900, Stein was reactivated to take her place. She embarked on her first training cruise of this commissioning on 28 January 1901, bound for Lisbon, Portugal and Gibraltar. She returned to Kiel on 1 April and, over the course of 30 May to 1 August, she took part in training exercises, made a visit to Riga to participate in celebrations marking the 700th anniversary of the city's founding, and toured ports in the North Sea. She then began a cruise to the West Indies; while stopped in San Sebasti√°n, she was visited by the Spanish king, Alfonso XIII. Stein reached Port of Spain on 18 October and joined the East American Cruiser Division, though she returned to Germany on 6 January 1902. She moved to Kiel on 17 March to begin preparing for the year's training routine, which began in mid- May with exercises in the Baltic and North Seas. On 29 July, Stein began another cruise to the Mediterranean, stopping in the Azores on the way. She visited Constantinople on 10 November, where Sultan Abdul Hamid II received the ship's commander and the other senior officers. Stein then went to Piraeus, Greece, where the gunboat was holding a German seaman who had been convicted of murder; Stein took the man aboard to return him to Germany for judgement. On leaving the port, Stein passed through the Corinth Canal, the first German warship to do so. She arrived in Kiel on 18 March 1903, and after completing an overhaul, took cruises in the North and Baltic Seas beginning on 15 May. Later in the year she went on another cruise to the West Indies and also visited ports in southern North America, before returning to Kiel on 22 March 1904. She then cruised in the North Sea and visited Iceland, before beginning another Mediterranean cruise; while in Corfu, Stein celebrated her 25th year in commission on 21 October. She arrived back in Germany on 18 March 1906. Stein made a brief cruise in the Baltic later in 1906, and went on other cruise to the West Indies toward the end of the year, returning to Germany on 20 March 1907. On 17 July, she began her last overseas cruise, sailing to Funchal in Madeira before entering the Mediterranean. She returned to Kiel on 21 March 1908 and then went to Wilhelmshaven, where she was decommissioned for the last time on 3 April. She was stricken from the naval register on 21 May and converted into a barracks ship, a role she filled through World War I. After the end of the war, Stein was discarded as part of the dismantling of Germany's navy, being broken up in 1920.

K. Simmons. The film is a remake of the 2008 Icelandic film Reykjav√≠k-Rotterdam which Baltasar Korm√°kur starred in. It was released on January 13, 2012 in the United States by Universal Pictures. Plot Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) is an ex-smuggler who now has a peaceful life with his wife, Kate (Kate Beckinsale), and their two sons in New Orleans. They learn that Kate's brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) was smuggling drugs, but dropped them into the Mississippi River during a surprise inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Andy's boss, mobster Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi), threatens to kill Chris' family if Andy doesn't pay him back $700,000. Chris decides to raise the money by running contraband, working with his former smuggling partner, Sebastian Abney (Ben Foster), who now owns a legitimate construction company. Promising Kate he will not run drugs, Chris joins a cargo ship, planning to buy $10,000,000 in fake bills in Panama and smuggle them into the U.S. He is joined by Andy, his good friend Danny Raymer (Lukas Haas), and gets help from crew mates. After Briggs breaks into Chris' house and intimidates his wife and children, Kate moves into Sebastian's house for safety. In Panama, Chris discovers that the only one who can provide high quality fake bills is crime lord Gonzalo (Diego Luna). Leaving Andy in the van with the money for the fake bills, Chris meets with Gonzalo to negotiate. Briggs calls Andy, threatens to kill one of Chris' sons and forces him to take the money and buy cocaine. With the money gone, Chris and Danny agree to help Gonzalo rob an armored car in exchange for the fake bills. After a shootout in which Gonzalo's group along with numerous police and security officers get killed, they successfully steal a Jackson Pollock painting that resembles a splattered tarp. Chris and Danny barely make it back to the ship with the fake bills and the painting. They drive the van with contraband into a container, which is loaded onto their cargo ship. Chris hits and berates Andy for using the money to buy cocaine, but apologizes when Andy explains the reason. It is revealed that Sebastian is working with Briggs, and he desperately needs money to pay gangster Jim Church (David O'Hara). Sebastian calls Chris and learns that Chris plans to get rid of the cocaine Andy bought. Sebastian instructs Briggs to threaten Kate. Through Kate, Briggs warns Chris not to dump the cocaine. Chris realizes that Sebastian has betrayed him. Sebastian contacts the cargo ship's Captain Camp (J. K. Simmons), with whom he has a partnership. He tells Camp of Chris' smuggled contraband, and promises him a share if he secures it. Unable to get Chris to give up the contraband, Camp calls U.S. Customs to inspect the ship in New Orleans. The Customs agents find the container with Chris' van, which is empty except for the paint splattered tarp, which they ignore. Once Chris is on shore, Briggs and his thugs demand the drug package. Chris takes Briggs to Camp's house, having made a duplicate key while on the ship, and knowingly activates the security system. Chris opens Camp's carpet cleaner and retrieves the cocaine from it. While Briggs and his gang sit in Camp's living room with the cocaine, Chris sneaks out. Camp awakens to the noise and comes into the living room as the police arrive. Both Briggs's group and Camp are arrested for possession of the cocaine. Warned by Chris, Kate leaves Sebastian's house. When she goes back to retrieve some personal items, Sebastian gets angry with her and accidentally pushes her against a bathtub. Thinking she is dead, he dumps her (unconscious) body in a yet to be poured foundation at one of his construction sites. Chris goes to Sebastian's construction site and beats up Sebastian, Chris manages to locate and save Kate by calling her cellphone. Sebastian is arrested and sent to prison, where he is greeted by a lynch mob. Danny retrieves the fake bills, which were dumped into the Mississippi River by Chris before docking in New Orleans. At a U.S. Customs auction, Andy buys the escape van earlier confiscated from the cargo ship, and finds the painting still in it. Church pays Chris $3 million for the fake currency and asks about the missing Jackson Pollock. Chris learns the painting can be fenced for over $20 million on the black market. The film ends with Chris, Kate, Andy and the boys beginning a new life in a waterfront house.

Release =Critical reception= Contraband garnered mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 51/100 on Metacritic indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Based on 162 reviews, the film currently holds an approval rating of 51% with an average score of 5.42/10, from Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus saying: \\"It's more entertaining than your average January action thriller, but that isn't enough to excuse Contraband's lack of originality and unnecessarily convoluted plot.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2/4 stars and felt that \\"Contraband involves a lot of energy,\\" but he was growing \\"tired of violent retreads of these heist elements.\\" Tom Long of The Detroit News criticized the film for having \\"too much plot and too little character\\" and concluded that it \\"comes off the factory floor with its engine running and ready to drive. But the ride feels overly familiar.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today called \\"the 'one last job' trope ... a particularly tired one\\" and remarked that while it \\"has a few moments of tension,\\" the film \\"adheres to a predictable heist formula hardly worth trafficking in.\\" Andrew O'Hehir of Salon characterized the film as \\"exactly the sort of movie that Hollywood specializes in, the kind which seems on paper as if it ought to be entertaining, but winds up a massive and chaotic drag\\" and observed that \\"it's much more like a cynical hash job, whose faux-realistic manner can't hide all the hackneyed crime-movie situations.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone thought the film \\"goes down in a sea of Hollywood clich√©s\\" and that Mark \\"Wahlberg could sleepwalk through this role, and does. See this movie and you'll surely follow his lead.\\" Kyle Smith of the New York Post derided the film, noting that \\"watching a hero progress due in large part to lucky breaks and idiot moves by others does not make a movie\\" and that \\"it's puzzling why anyone considered this script worth shooting.\\" Scott Tobias of NPR dismissed the film as a \\"mediocre [...] thriller,\\" something \\"to be remembered, vaguely.\\" Rafer Guzman of Newsday expressed disappointment that \\"a little action is all you'll get\\" and opined that the film \\"fails by overreaching: It aspires to the heightened drama of The Departed but lands instead in the bargain bin of forgettable action product.\\" Justin Chang of Variety praised the film as \\"reasonably swift and effective\\" and for taking \\"a hard-driving line of action and a commitment to one-damned-thing-after-another storytelling\\", while suffering from \\"preposterous detours.\\" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post compared the film to \\"an Ocean's Eleven movie, minus the glamour\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly stated that the film, \\"while often grungy and far-fetched, does keep you watching\\", which is sufficient for a film released in January. =DVD release= Contraband was released to DVD on April 24, 2012 with a rating of R.

This TV musical marked the beginning of a yearlong celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of the great Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore. This new concept was a brainchild of the famous Indian director Rituparno Ghosh The songs were all popular Rabindra sangeets. Prosenjit Chatterjee brought back the magic of this show by launching an audio CD of its tracks on Mahalaya on October 12. A Sequel is on the making. Storyline  The story revolves around a girl called Sohini (more commonly known as Pupe) from an orthodox Tagore worshipping family and Gora, an extremely talented but carefree lad, who keeps on experimenting with Rabindra sangeet. The story traces their relationship and human emotions through an imaginative portrayal of Tagore, his true ideals and their significance today. It also portrays the patriarchal society still prevalent in modern India. The serial used more than fifty Tagore songs and brought out their relevance in the lives of the protagonists. The cast was composed of stalwarts such as Sabyasachi Chakrabarty and Dipankar De plus newcomers Gaurav and Arjun Chakrabarty (sons of Sabyasachi Chakrabarty ). The female lead was played by Mimi Chakrabarty in only her second project as an actress. The show has portrayed three different forms of Rabindrasangeet: the more traditional kind through the voice of Pupe, a fused version with Hindustani classical music, through the voice of Pradipto, and an 'unplugged' rendition, sometimes incorporating rap words and band music, through Gora. Several singers such as Anindya Narayan Biswas, Samantak Sinha, Sharmistha Paul, Soumyojit Das, Amrita Datta, Debashish Banerjee and Runu Dutta were roped for playback singers.

Also known within its native range as toronjo, tumo, or coquina mel√≥n, S. vestissimum is a large semi-woody plant or shrub, up to 8 meters in height, though usually much smaller. The very large heart-shaped leaves are lined with spines along the top and bottom of the dorsal vein, similar to the naranjilla or pseudolulo. The leaves and stems of the plant are otherwise covered in short, felt-like hairs. Native to temperate, cloud forest zones of Colombia and Venezuela, the toronjo bears edible fruit, but is rarely cultivated. Instead, the plant proliferates as a weedy species at medium- altitude locations in its native countries. Like the naranjilla, the toronjo prefers shaded or semi-shaded growing environments. The fruit is a large berry, green when unripe, ripening to yellow or yellow-orange, about the size of a small tomato or a large tomatillo. The orange flesh is filled with an abundance of small seeds. The strong, sweet-tart flavor is regarded as excellent, and worthy of further agricultural investigation, but the fruit is also covered with sharp bristles which persist upon full ripening, and which can be irritating to the skin Unharvested fruit will often swell and burst, releasing seeds. Some botanists consider the toronjo to be worthy of investigation as an agricultural fruit plant, though a significant amount of breeding and selection for less bristly fruits would be needed. (2005): . Version of December 2005. Retrieved 2008-SEP-25. Classification Within the genus Solanum, S. vestissimum is a part of the leptostemonum clade. Within this clade, S. vestissimum belongs to the Lasiocarpa clade. Other species within this clade include: S. candidum, S. hyporhodium, S. lasiocarpum, S. felinum, S. quitoense, S. repandum and S. pseudolulo. Specimens of each of these plants are often spiny, covered in short hairs, and share a similar leaf shape; many of them bear edible fruit, and hybrids between many of these species are possible. In both fruit quality and plant appearance, there is considerable diversity within each of these species.

He entered the navy during the Spanish armament in 1790 and served aboard a number of ships, starting at the level of able seaman and rising through the ranks, having reached midshipman on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. A lieutenancy followed while serving in the Caribbean, where he acted in support of army operations against enemy colonies and islands, before his return to Britain. He was afterwards employed in the English Channel and North Sea, where he distinguished himself on a cutting out expedition off the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog, narrowly escaping death when a ship he tried and failed to board suddenly exploded. After again supporting land operations, this time in Holland, he was promoted to commander though he had to then wait two years for a command. Promotion to post captain soon followed, and he went to North America to command the flagship of the admiral in command there. Desertion from Royal Navy ships had become a pressing issue and Humphreys, by then in command of the 50-gun , was ordered to intercept the , which was suspected to have several deserters as part of her crew. Humphreys did so, and requested permission to search her. Chesapeakes captain refused, so Humphreys fired upon her, the poorly prepared American ship surrendered and Humphreys took off several British deserters. The backlash from the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, as it became known as, was severe. A political crisis was precipitated between the governments of Britain and the United States, and to mollify the Americans, Humphreys was given no further commands. He was already wealthy, having married an heiress, and settling at the estates of Bramall Hall. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1837, and then restored on the active lists, having changed his surname to Davenport in 1838 on the occasion of his wife's inheritance. He died in 1845. Family and early life Salusbury Pryce Humphreys was born at Clungunford Rectory, Shropshire, on 24 November 1778, the third son of Reverend Evan Humphreys and his wife Mary. He entered the navy on 1 July 1790, during the Spanish armament, serving as a volunteer aboard the 64-gun , which was then under the command of Captain James Vashon. He was next aboard the 50-gun , the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir John Laforey in the Leeward Islands, followed by a posting to the 32-gun , commanded by Captain Matthew Squire. He was rated as able seaman during this last posting, after which he was moved to the 14-gun , commanded by Captain Francis Laforey. His next ship was the 50-gun , under Captain Paul Minchin, where he was rated as midshipman some time before the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France in February 1793. Severn conveyed the Governor General of Canada, Lord Dorchester, and his family and suite, to Quebec, returning to Britain in 1794. Humphreys followed Minchin to his next command, the 38-gun , and went out to the West Indies. While serving there, Humphreys was ordered to act as lieutenant of the 14-gun under Captain Henry Evans in April 1796. Humphreys was next in action supporting the army under Sir Ralph Abercromby at the siege of Saint Lucia, and afterwards convoyed the despatches concerning the attack on Porto Rico back to Britain. His promotion to lieutenant came on 17 January 1797, together with an appointment to the armed ship Sally, serving in the North Sea under Captain George Wolfe. In 1798 he received a posting to the 32-gun , also in the North Sea, under the command of Captain George Dundas. =Cutting out expedition= In August 1798 Humphreys was sent with some of Junos men to support a cutting out expedition led by Captain Adam Mackenzie of off the island of Schiermonnikoog. In an action on 11 August British boats succeeded in attacking and capturing the gunboat Crash, and preparing an operation to capture a large Dutch schooner, named Vengeance, anchored under the protection of a battery on the island, Mackenzie sent Humphreys and another lieutenant to capture some schuyts on 12 August. They captured two, burning one and sailing the other back to the British flotilla. Mackenzie armed the captured schuyt with 12-pounder carronades and named her Undaunted, placing Humphreys in command. Mackenzie launched his attack on the Dutch schooner and battery the following day, 13 August. Crash was supposed to have covered Humphreys in Undaunted, but she ran aground. Undaunted, Humphreys pushed on, coming alongside the Dutch schooner just as she was abandoned by her crew. The strong tide meant that he could not maintain his station alongside the Dutch vessel, and the roundness of her sides prevented him from leaping aboard. Instead he took a rope and jumped into the sea, hoping to be able to swim to the ship, board her and attach a rope. Once in the water he found that he could make little headway against the tide, and had to be hauled back on board. He had just regained the deck of Undaunted when Vengeance exploded, her crew having set a fuse to the ship's magazine before they abandoned her. Meanwhile, the rest of the flotilla successfully stormed the Dutch battery and spiked its guns. None of the attacking force was killed or wounded in the operation. After the Anglo- Russian invasion of Holland in August 1799 Humphreys left Juno and moved to the 50-gun , which was then the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell with the Channel Fleet. He followed Mitchell to , serving on the Zuiderzee during the operations in Holland, and was then aboard , assigned to a squadron under Captain Henry Inman of , which carried out an attack on 7 July 1800 against four French frigates anchored at Dunkirk. Humphreys moved again with Mitchell to the 90-gun in 1800, and while serving aboard her, received a promotion to commander, on 29 April 1802. Command Despite his promotion, Humphreys had to wait nearly two years before receiving his own command, until finally appointed to the bomb vessel at Portsmouth in January 1804. His time in command was short, as on 8 May he was promoted to post captain. He married Jane Elizabeth Morin in March 1805, the couple having one son together. Humphreys went out to Halifax the following year to take command of the 50-gun , the flagship of the station commander Vice-Admiral George Berkeley. He assumed command on his arrival in May, but it was then decided to send Leander back to Britain, and Humphreys was instead transferred to the 50-gun in October. Berkeley preferred to live onshore, meaning that for much of the time Leopard acted as a private ship. =The Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard affair= Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard affair. (right) fires on . The Royal Navy had been having significant problems with men deserting their ships whilst in American ports, and then joining ships of the US Navy. Berkeley had been made aware of deserters from several ships who had joined the crew of the heavy frigate , and on 1 June 1807 he issued an order that Chesapeake be stopped at sea and searched for deserters. Apprehending them in town proved impossible as the men were under the protection of the magistrates. Berkeley directed that in return, the American captain was permitted to search British vessels for American deserters. Sent to enforce Berkeley's order, Captain Humphreys located Chesapeake off Norfolk, Virginia on 22 June and sent a lieutenant across to request permission to search her. Chesapeakes commander, Commodore James Barron, refused to allow this and ordered his men to prepare for an action. Faced with Barron's refusal, Humphreys bore up and opened fire on her, hitting her with several broadsides. The unprepared Chesapeake fired a single shot in reply, and then struck her colours. Humphreys sent a party across to search the ship, and found four deserters, Daniel Martin, John Strachan, and William Ware, run from ; and Jenkin Ratford, run from . They were taken aboard Leopard, which then departed, Humphreys having refused to accept Barron's offer to consider Chesapeake a prize. Chesapeake had three men killed, eight men badly wounded, and ten slightly wounded. Though his conduct was approved of by Berkeley, it caused outrage amongst the Americans and became a major political incident. Anxious to appease the Americans, an Order in Council was issued, banning the use of force against foreign warships, Berkeley was recalled and Humphreys too found himself a victim of political movements. He returned to Britain in 1808 and was not offered any further commands. He was given the title of rear admiral in 1837. Life ashore Rear Admiral Sir Salusbury Davenport in later life Humphreys spent the remainder of the war ashore on half-pay, finding occupation in civil duties, serving as a Justice of the Peace for Buckingham, Chester and Lancaster. His wife Jane died in September 1808, and Humphreys remarried on 31 May 1810, to Maria Davenport, of Bramall Hall. The couple had five sons and two daughters together. After the wars had ended he was put on the list of superannuated captains, but achieved some recompense when he was made a Companion of the Bath on 26 September 1831, on the occasion of King William IV's Coronation Honours. He received a further honour when he was nominated a Knight Commander of the Guelphic Order of Hanover in February 1834, and was promoted to rear admiral on 10 January 1837. He assumed the surname of Davenport when his wife inherited the Davenport estates at Bramall in 1838, and was restored to the active list on 17 August 1840. He settled at Bramall and had become widely respected in the Stockport area prior to his wife's inheritance, but following his succession to the estate there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property. He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841, most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns. He died there on 17 November 1845 at the age of sixty-six and was buried in Leckhampton.

History  Early depth sounding was achieved using lead line sounding (or sounding line), where a lead weight attached to a length of rope marked with depth values. As this method was mechanical in nature, the only correction that was applied to the sounding was the reduction of the sounding for tidal height. In the mid 20th century, sonar systems were developed to allow the measurement of underwater distances using the two way travel time of an acoustic pulse. This allowed the surveyor to take many more soundings in a given period of time and was less labor intensive than using a lead line.  Use  For many applications of sonar the speed of sound can be assumed to be an average speed of 1500 meters per second. However, the speed of sound in seawater can vary from 1440 to 1570 meters per second., UN Atlas of the Oceans, physical and chemical properties of seawater. An example of a sound velocity probe ‚Äì the Teledyne Odom Digibar Pro As the relationship of speed, time and distance are dependent, in order to accurately measure the distance one must also know the time of transmit to receive and the speed of sound in water accurately. There are two methods that this can be achieved. Firstly, the surveyor can use an air filled metal bar lowered below the transducer, attached at each end by a rope marked with depth values. If the values on the rope can be assumed to be correct, then the bar is lowered at set depth intervals and observed on the echo sounder trace. The values of echo sounder depth can be plotted against the \\"true\\" depth of the bar. Any fixed offset value would then be attributed to a draft value correction, and any gradient change seen is as a result of a difference in sound velocity. This method is called a \\"Bar Check\\", and is performed by the surveyor prior to gathering data. Secondly, the surveyor can use a sound velocity probe that can be lowered into the water in the area to be surveyed to measure the actual speed of sound. This has the advantage of being quicker than a bar check and it can be performed when there is boat motion due to swell and sea, although any draft offset of the vessel is not identified using this method.  Theory of operation  There are two common methods to obtaining sound velocity in water using the probe method. Firstly, the main three variables that affect sound velocity may be measured using a Conductivity, Temperature & Depth Probe (CTD Probe). This instrument can determine the salinity, temperature and pressure variables, and then calculate the sound velocity of the water using one of the many formulae available. Secondly, the speed of sound may be directly measured using a small acoustic transducer and a reflecting surface, mounted at a known distance from the acoustic center of the transducer. If the distance from the transducer to the reflector is known, and the time taken from the transmit to the receive pulse is known, then the speed of sound in water can be calculated. Transducers used in sound velocity probes are typically of a high frequency (around 1 - 4 MHz) as the transmit and receive distances are close enough to mitigate any significant absorption losses.

It was constructed by James Jerome Hill's St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway, and became part of the Great Northern Railway in 1889. History James Jerome Hill, primary stockholder and president of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway (StPM&M;), established the Montana Central Railway on January 25, 1886.Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 57. Few railroads served Montana at that time. But Butte, Montana, was a booming mining town that needed to get its metals to market; gold and silver had been discovered near Helena, Montana; and coal companies in Canada were eager to get their fuel to Montana's smelters. Hill had already decided to build the StPM&M; across the northern tier of Montana, and it made sense to build a north-south railroad through central Montana to connect Great Falls with Helena and Butte. Another reason for building the Montana Central was Hill's investment in the city of Great Falls. Hill's close friend and business associate, Paris Gibson, had founded the town of Great Falls on the Great Falls of the Missouri River in 1883, and was promoting it as a site for the development of cheap hydroelectricity and heavy industry.Martin, p. xxi; Malone, 1996, p. 132; Guthrie, p. 20; Taliaferro, p. 120-121. Hill organized the Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Company in 1887,McCormick, p. 2.The Montana Almanac, p. 381. with the goal of developing the town of Great Falls; providing it with power, sewage, and water; and attracting commerce and industry to the city.Report of the Bureau of Agriculture Labor and Industry of the State of Montana, p. 223. To attract industry to the new city, he offered low rates on the Montana Central Railway.Strom, p. 151. Surveyors and engineers began grading a route between Helena and Great Falls in the winter of 1885-1886 (even before the company had been incorporated), and by the end of 1886 had surveyed a route from Helena to Butte. Utah businessmen Alfred W. McCune, John Caplis (also known as John Caplice), and Walter Read along with Helena, Montana, businessman Hugh Kirkendall formed a company to build the road.Whitney, p. 507. Construction on the Great Northern's line westward began in late 1886, and on October 16, 1887, the link between Devils Lake, North Dakota; Fort Assinniboine (near the present-day city of Havre); and Great Falls was complete.Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 57-60. Service to Helena began in November 1887, and Butte followed on November 10, 1888.Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 60; \\"St. Paul Minneapolis and Manitoba,\\" Railway News, November 30, 1889, p. 966. The Montana Central's engines and cars were marked either with \\"Great Northern\\" or \\"Montana Central,\\" with the capital letters \\"MC\\" over the number of the car or engine.The Official Railway Equipment Register, p. 137. On September 18, 1889, Hill changed the name of the Minneapolis and St. Cloud Railway (a railroad which existed primarily on paper, but which held very extensive land grants throughout the Pacific Northwest) to the Great Northern Railway.Yenne, p. 23. On February 1, 1890, he transferred ownership of the StPM&M;, Montana Central, and other rail systems he owned to the Great Northern. For many years, these subsidiaries operated independently. But most of them were later absorbed into the Great Northern. In 1907, the Montana Central ceased to exist after it was made part of the Great Northern.Wood, Struthers & Co., p. 92.

Beyond OQ2, additional production will increase per-unit costs, reflecting diseconomies of scale. Consequently, the societally optimal firm size is OQ2, where long-run average cost is at its lowest level. The socially optimal firm size is the size for a company in a given industry at a given time which results in the lowest production costs per unit of output.  Discussion  If only diseconomies of scale existed, then the long-run average cost-minimizing firm size would be one worker, producing the minimal possible level of output. However, economies of scale also apply, which state that large firms can have lower per-unit costs due to buying at bulk discounts (components, insurance, real estate, advertising, etc.) and can also limit competition by buying out competitors, setting proprietary industry standards (like Microsoft Windows), etc. If only these \\"economies of scale\\" applied, then the ideal firm size would be infinitely large. However, since both apply, the firm must not be too small or too large, to minimize unit costs. Variation in optimal firm size by industry The \\"diseconomies of scale\\" do not tend to vary widely by industry, but \\"economies of scale\\" do. An auto maker has very high fixed costs, which are lower per unit of output the more output is produced. On the other hand, a florist has very low fixed costs and hence very limited sources of economies of scale. Thus there are disparate degrees of economies of scales for different types of organizations. Effects of agricultural, industrial, and service-based economies on optimal firm size An industrial society will tend to have large firms, as industry has substantial economies of scale. A service-based economy will favor smaller firms, as services have limited economies of scale. There will, of course, be exceptions, such as Microsoft, which is a huge services company. Effect of free entry on firm size In the short run, it is possible for an individual firm to make an economic profit. This situation is shown in this diagram, as the price or average revenue, denoted by P, is above the minimum average cost. The firm produces the quantity Q, at the intersection of marginal cost and marginal revenue After entry of enough other firms has occurred, their increase in market supply has driven down the price of the good, so that economic profits of each firm are zero. If the market for a product exhibits free entry, meaning that firms can enter (and exit) the market at will with no logistical, legal, or other inhibiting factors, and if firms have U-shaped long-run average cost curves as in the graphs at the right, then in the long run all firms will end up producing at their point of minimum average cost. For suppose a particular firm with the illustrated long-run average cost curve is faced with the market price P indicated in the upper graph. The firm produces at the quantity of output where marginal cost equals marginal revenue (labeled Q in the upper graph), and its per-unit economic profit is the difference between average revenue AR and average total cost ATC at that point, the difference being P minus C in the graph's notation. With firms making economic profit and with free entry, other firms will enter the market for this product, and their additional supply will bring down the market price of the product; this process will continue until there is no longer any economic profit to entice further entrants. The long-run outcome is shown in the second graph, with production by each firm occurring at the newly labelled Q, with marginal cost equalling price at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve, and with the gap between average revenue (the height of the average revenue curve at this Q) and average cost (the height of the average cost curve at this Q) being zero. Thus with firms possessing U-shaped long-run average cost curves, perfect competition, with (1) firms small enough relative to the overall market that they cannot individually influence the product's market price, and with (2) free entry, leads in the long run to a situation in which no firm is making economic profit, and in which firms are of their socially optimal size (producing at the minimum of their long-run average cost curve).

Hermann Alois Boehm (27 October 1884, F√ºrth, Bavaria ‚Äì 7 June 1962, Gie√üen) was a German eugenicist, doctor, professor of 'Racial Hygiene' and SA-Sanit√§ts- Gruppenf√ºhrer during the Nazi era. Hermann Boehm became a member of the NSDAP (Nazi party) on March 24, 1925 with member number 126. Boehm began early to expand his research into racial hygiene. He was regarded within the NSDAP as a person with a considerable level of knowledge in this field, so that he was entrusted with the relevant posts. From 1931-1933 he served as racial hygiene adviser of the National Socialist German Doctors' League and from June 1933 to July 1934 as scientific director for heredity and race hygiene at the Reich Committee on Public Health. On 19 November 1934 he was appointed extraordinary Honorary Professor of Racial Care at the University of Leipzig. The main focus of his scientific publishing activities until 1934 was mainly on racial hygiene issues; he later advanced into the first rank of race hygienists. In March 1937 Boehm was appointed as a training manager by the Reich physician SA Obergruppenf√ºhrer Dr. med. Gerhard Wagner of the \\"F√ºhrerschule\\" (Leader School) in Alt Rehse. The focus of Boehm's work was the teaching of knowledge in heritage and race care. At the same time, Boehm was given the opportunity to set up his own genetic engineering research institute. This institute was primarily intended to introduce the course participants of the \\"F√ºhrerschule\\" to the basics of genetics. Boehm described his job in Old Rehse as: \\"From the outset, it was my plan to use young people in the field of hereditary biology and racial hygiene at the institute.\\" In addition to his actual work at the \\"Fuhrschule\\", Boehm was one of the few independent experts to compile hereditary biological assessments. Boehm was an ordinary professor of racial improvement at Giessen from January 1, 1943 until the end of World War II. The training at the \\"Fuehrerschule\\" laid the spiritual foundation, provided the necessary racial hygiene equipment, which ultimately allowed the doctor to end even the \\"life unworthy of life\\" by lethal injection, food deprivation or gas.

Hall, the open field test is an experimental test used to assay general locomotor activity levels, anxiety, and willingness to explore in animals (usually rodents) in scientific research. However, the extent to which behavior in the open field measures anxiety is controversial. The open field test can be used to assess memory by evaluating the ability of the animal to recognize a stimuli or object. Another animal test that is used to assess memory using that same concept is the novel object recognition test. Concept Animals such as rats and mice display a natural aversion to brightly lit open areas. However, they also have a drive to explore a perceived threatening stimulus. Decreased levels of anxiety lead to increased exploratory behavior. Increased anxiety will result in less locomotion and a preference to stay close to the walls of the field (thigmotaxis).  Experimental design  A circular open field The open field is an arena with walls to prevent escape. Commonly, the field is marked with a grid and square crossings. The center of the field is marked with a different color to differentiate from the other squares. In the modern open field apparatus, infrared beams or video cameras with associated software can be used to automate the assessment process. Stretch attend posture Behavioral patterns measured in the open field test include: * Line crossings ‚Äì Frequency with which the rodent crosses grid lines with all four paws (a measure of locomotor activity), sometimes divided into activity near the wall and activity in the center * Center square entries ‚Äì Frequency with which the rodent enters the center square with all four paws * Center square duration ‚Äì Duration of time spent in the central square * Rearing ‚Äì Frequency with which the rodent stands on its hind legs in the field. Rearing-up behavior in which the forepaws of the animal are unsupported and the similar behavior in which the forepaws rest against the walls of the enclosure have different underlying genetic and neural mechanisms and unsupported rearing might be a more direct measure of anxiety. * Stretch attend postures ‚Äì Frequency with which rodent demonstrated forward elongation of the head and shoulders followed by retraction to the original position. High frequency indicates high levels of anxiety. * Defecation and urination ‚Äì The frequency of defecation and urination is controversial. Some scientists argue that increase in defecation shows increased anxiety. Other scientists disagree and state that defecation and urination show signs of emotionality but cannot be assumed to be anxiety Criticisms The assumption that the test is based on conflict has been heavily criticized. Critics point out that when measuring anxiety each choice should have both positive and negative outcomes. This leads to more dependable observations which the OFT does not present. When the test was first developed, it was pharmacologically validated through the use of benzodiazepines, a common anxiety medication. Newer drugs such as 5-HT-1A partial agonists and Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which have also been proven to treat anxiety show inconsistent results in this test. Due to the idiopathic nature of anxiety, animal models have flaws that cannot be controlled. Because of this it is better to do the open field test in conjuncture with other tests such as the elevated plus maze and light-dark box test. Different results can be obtained depending on the strain of the animal. Different equipment and grid lines may cause different results.

Old Heath has existed since Saxon times and was originally called 'Old Hythe' because it was the first port of Colchester, before Hythe (called Newehethe in 1311) took over: hythe derives from the Old English word for 'landing place'. Logo The logo depicts a ship sailing upon the waves and bears two sails each with a coat of arms. Old Heath is derived from the original Old Hythe or the first Port of Colchester which was located within the parish boundaries of Old Heath. The Port on this location can be traced back to Saxon times. The ship, therefore, represents the fact that Old Heath was the port and still has an active Quayside at King Edward and Haven Quays, both located in the parish. More modern political boundaries have tended to count this part of Old Heath with the part generally known as ‚ÄòThe Hythe‚Äô in the Parish of New Town as if they were all part of the same community (which politicians call Harbour) but this is not so and the parish boundaries are clearly marked by our ‚ÄòWelcome to Old Heath‚Äô signs. Old Heath developed as a separate village beyond the boundaries of Colchester. The two sails of the ship carry the Arms of Colchester and St. Barnabas. Colchester‚Äôs Arms represent the ‚ÄòTrue Cross‚Äô of Jesus because it is believed that St. Helena (Patron Saint of Colchester) visited Colchester. St. Helena claimed to have discovered the true cross upon which Jesus was crucified when she was visiting the Holy sites in and around Jerusalem. St. Helena was the mother of the Emperor Constantine and Colchester was a Roman City. The forward sail is the Coat of Arms of St. Barnabas who is the Patron Saint of Old Heath. St. Barnabas is known as ‚ÄòThe Son of Consolation‚Äô and it may be that he became Patron for Old Heath because we were located in the poor part of what was becoming the big and rich Town of Colchester. St. Barnabas is said to bring comfort and hope to the poor. This sign appears on all buildings for community use in Old Heath, on the signs welcoming you into the parish from every direction and all on correspondence from the Vicarage and from the Community Task group. Churches Old Heath Congregational Church (or Chapel). Old Heath has a parish church (CofE) called St Barnabas's and also a small Congregational Chapel known as the 'tin tabernacle'.'Old Heath Community Centre' The original church of St Barnabas was demolished in 1949 after being declared unsafe. The Congregational Chapel was subject to a planning application for demolition in December 2014, which was refused. See here for more details, and document references about the building. Services Old Heath Primary School Old Heath has four regular bus services to and from Colchester town centre, a post office, a local Co- op., 'East of England Co op' a butcher, a baker and a greengrocer. It also has a fish and chip shop to the south of the village, and a small garage.

She was best known for her classic \\"Oh Lieve Vrouwetoren\\". She had a typical deep voice, causing her to be called sometimes the Belgian Zarah Leander. La Esterella was the first Flemish artist who achieved international success. She was born and died in Antwerp Biography Lambrechts began working as a seamstress before becoming a professional singer. She occasionally sang at parties and was thus noticed by the conductor Jacques Kluger. But, when asked, she refused to sing in his band because she didn't have parental permission. In 1940 she began participating in song contests in the music hall Oud-Belgi√´ in Antwerp. There she was discovered by her future husband and manager Charly Schleimovitz. She began her career as a singer of popular light classical and romantic songs in several languages. Her voice could span three and a half octaves. She had an immediate success with the public. Her husband didn't just arrange the business agreements but also taught her how to become a professional singer, turning her into a perfectionist. During World War II, she was forced to perform in Germany where she was called \\"die Kanone\\". After the war, she became a success with the general public and performed every year during six months from 1948‚Äì54 in British seaside resorts. In 1948, she sang on the BBC. In 1948 she sang in other European countries such as France, Norway and Czechoslovakia, where she always sung at least one song in the local language. In 1953 she was offered a recording contract with Philips Records. From then on, the record company advised her to sing in her native Dutch language. In that year, her song \\"Oh Lieve Vrouwetoren\\" became an immediate hit. She continued to score hits, until 1959. In that year her husband became gravely ill and she decided to perform to a lesser degree. When her husband died in 1962, she stopped performing completely. She accepted a job as secretary and remarried in 1970. Her second husband Victor Van Buel died in 1980. After her retirement in 1982, she agreed somewhat surprisingly to the radio presenter Jos Baudewijn to act in his show \\"Vragen staat vrij.\\" (Open questions). There she sang Frank Sinatra's song Ol' Man River. She got such good responses that she decided to resume her career. She rose in this second career to become a celebrated singer, cherished by the public at large. In 1988, she recorded her last album \\"Liedjes die ik graag zing\\" (\\"My favourite songs\\"). In later years she sporadically recorded some songs, including in 1995 with Coco Jr. In 2000 she finally recorded the soundtrack of the film Shades with Alex Callier of Hooverphonic and Regi Penxten of Milk Inc. In 2001 she received the achievement award of Radio 2: Voor een Leven Vol Muziek (For a Life filled with Music) and was admitted to the Hall of Fame of the Flemish Song. She was also appointed to the rank of Officer in the Order of Leopold II. In 2004 she presented together with the first Antwerp City poet (Tom Lanoye), the poem \\"De kathedraal antwoordt\\" (The cathedral replies). Although she began to have problems walking at her old age, she continued performing. Occasionally she was back on major stages and did some TV appearances. On 5 January 2007 she sang a duet with Paul Michiels in the TV show \\"Gala Gaston 80\\", honouring the Flemish comedian Gaston Berghmans at his 80th birthday. In 2008, she continued to struggle with health problems and had to spend three months in a hospital. She had then to retire to a nursing home, where the aged Flemish actress Yvonne Verbeeck also stayed. Death On 11 April 2011, La Esterella died in a hospital in Antwerp, aged 91. On 16 April, her funeral was attended by a large crowd. On 18 April, she was interred in Schoonselhof cemetery in Antwerp.

He received a Ph.D. in 1978 from the University of Massachusetts Amherst where his thesis advisor was Professor Otto Vogl. In 1978, he held a postdoctoral position at Kyoto University.  Career  Dr. Tirrell was a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Carnegie-Mellon University from 1978-1984. He served as the Director of the Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1978-1998. He moved to Caltech in 1998 and served as chairman of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech from 1999 until 2009. He edited the Journal of Polymer Science from 1988-1999. Tirrell applies principles from biology and chemistry to polymer synthesis. Recognizing that most synthetic polymers are mixtures, rather than pure substances, he developed pioneering techniques for the creation of precisely-defined polymers of uniform structure. Tirrell and his co-workers have formed crystals, liquid crystals and gels with predetermined, programmable molecular architectures and accompanying properties. His work in macromolecular synthesis underlies the development of \\"smart\\" materials, which respond to external cues like temperature, pH, chemical reagents, or light. Tirrell has gone on to make important contributions to protein biosynthesis, effectively reprogramming the genetic code of biological cells to produce artificial, protein-like macromolecules. Specialized macromolecules may provide materials for use in surgery and regenerative medicine. Areas that he is exploring include the use of artificial amino acids in the preparation of proteins, the evolution of novel proteins, and analysis of cellular processes.

Historically, cizye originated as a poll-tax on non-Muslims which, in the Ottoman Empire, was theoretically a substitute for military service, as Christians and people of other religions were not permitted to bear arms. Over time, the Ottoman military transition from feudal conscripts to professional armies led to many members of the Muslim public paying a charge in lieu of military service too. However, the Khatt-i Humayun firman in 1856 - a cornerstone of the tanzimat reform process - explicitly granted more equal tax-treatment to people of all religions. This would have abolished the use of the cizye system to maintain an all-Muslim army; but there was little interest in creating a multi-faith army, so the Porte replaced the cizye with bedl-i askeri, a tax payable only by non-Muslims who would have been liable for conscription. The bedl-i askeri was set at 50 lira per person. Not all men within a certain age-range would have been liable for conscription (in order to maintain a certain size of army), so only certain individuals were liable - and the proportion shrank as the empire's population grew. Over time, this bedl-i askeri began to be shared out amongst most non- Christian men, not just those who would have been conscripted, so the new tax came to resemble the old cizye again, and each person's share might only be 5 to 7 piasters. The 1909 constitution introduced compulsory conscription, and abolished any payment in lieu of conscription; so the bedl-i askeri ceased. The term \\"askeri\\" literally meant \\"military\\", but over the course of Ottoman history it came to refer to a ruling class; civil servants, ulema, and officers - in contrast to the raya, who were taxpayers rather than decision- makers.

Postwar, he became a pioneering aviator and aircraft manufacturer in Australia. He served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, and later became a human rights advocate and author. Early life Herbert Joseph Larkin was born in Brisbane, Queensland, on 8 October 1894. His mother, Annie Mary Frances McHugh Larkin, was from Queensland. His father, Herbert Benjamin George Larkin, was from Kent, England. The Larkin patriarch was a clerk for the Australian United Steam Navigation Company until about 1901; he then moved his family to Melbourne. By 1916, he accepted a manager's position with the Commonwealth Line, and would later rise to become Chairman of the Board. Herbert Joseph Larkin was educated at St. Thomas' Grammar School in Essendon, Victoria. He became a junior clerk for the Union Steam Ship Company. First World War On 19 August 1914, Larkin joined the 1st Signal Troop, Royal Australian Engineers, Australian Imperial Force as a corporal. He claimed two years prior experience in the 21st Signal Troop. He designated his next of kin as M. H. Larkin, residing in Saint Kilda, and claimed British citizenship. He served in both Egypt and at Gallipoli as signals clerk for Generals John Monash and Harry Chauvel. He was wounded in the chest by a sniper at Gallipoli on 18 September 1915 and medically evacuated to England. On 22 April 1916, Larkin was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps, and on 16 July was appointed a flying officer. His initial aerial assignment was to No. 5 Squadron on the French front. He was awarded the French Croix de guerre in March 1917 for the excellence of his visual and photographic reconnaissance work while piloting a Royal Aircraft Factory RE.8.Franks (2002), p.58. The award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 14 July. On 22 April 1917 Second Lieutenant Larkin was appointed a flight commander, with accompanying promotion to temporary captain. Larkin ended his tour with No. 5 Squadron by transferring back to England for instructor duty. When his instructor's posting ended, Larkin began a second combat tour with No. 87 Squadron. Larkin was sent to the squadron to command \\"A\\" Flight. He did so with calculated courage, using the potent new Sopwith Dolphins to strike at the enemy only when the British had a decided advantage over the foe. Larkin's first victories came on 3 June 1918, when he sent down a German Fokker Triplane and an Albatros D.V out of control over P√©ronne. He would not score again until 21 August 1918. On that day, he destroyed a Fokker D.VII and drove another down out of control in the morning, and destroyed another D.VII on an evening patrol over Fremicourt. Four days later, he destroyed another D.VII over Haplincourt. On 30 August 1918, he sent one Fokker D.VII down in flames and another down out of action over Velu Wood. On 3 September, he drove down two more Fokker D.VIIs from the sky above Epinoy. On the 16th, he destroyed another D.VII west of Abancourt. All the while he was scoring these victories, he also led his flight to success. He won the Distinguished Flying Cross for his valour. As the accompanying citation stated: :\\"In the recent fighting this officer has led twelve offensive patrols, and these patrols have destroyed twenty-one enemy machines and driven down four out of control. The success of his squadron is due not only to his most able leadership, but also to the fine fighting spirit he inspires by his personal courage and disregard of danger.\\" Interwar period =Pioneering Australian aviation= Larkin married Vera Grace Russell Doman in St. Saviour's Church, London, on 15 March 1919. On 15 July 1919 Larkin resigned his commission in the Royal Air Force. He and his bride sailed home to Australia, arriving in July 1919. After his arrival, he initially barnstormed \\"educational flights\\" in a Sopwith Dove and made fuel storage systems in his shop in Glenhuntly. Along with some old comrades from No. 87 Squadron, plus his brother Reg, Larkin founded an Australian Sopwith agency named Larkin Sopwith Aviation Co. of Australia Ltd. Larkin claimed the honor of the first night flight in Australia on 25 October 1919 when he piloted the Dove over Australia's version of the Henley Regatta. In 1920, Larkin organized Victoria, Australia's first air derby. On 28 February, he testified in court during an inquest into the death of a spectator killed during a buzzing incident during an aviation display at Geelong Racecourse two weeks prior. Larkin Aircraft Supply Company When Sopwith liquidated in 1921, Larkin's agency became the Larkin Aircraft Supply Company Limited. The company would grow to over 100 employees, and produce gliders and a number of powered light aircraft designs, including Australia's first all-metal airplane, the Lasco Lascoter of 1929. The company even opened a flying school in 1931. However, LASCO was crippled by the Great Depression. As part of its liquidation in 1935, Larkin testified that he had invested‚Äìand lost‚Äì¬£1,000 mustering out pay and a ¬£20,000 inheritance while running the company. Pioneering air mail In December 1921, Larkin won the government's airmail contract for the Sydney-Adelaide route. However, his lack of suitable aircraft and sufficient capital led him to partner with Frank L. Roberts in Australian Aerial Services. Roberts brought the government contract for the Sydney-Brisbane route into a partnership with Larkin. The need to form this partnership delayed acceptance of the contract until October 1923. As part of this partnership, Larkin Aircraft Supply Co. flew airmail and passengers over several different routes in Australia between 2 June 1924 and 9 September 1926, connecting Adelaide, Sydney, Broken Hill, Mildura, and Hay. However, service on Roberts' Sydney-Brisbane route failed. In 1928, Larkin underbid Qantas for the Camooweal-Daly Waters route, which would prove unprofitable. In February 1930, Larkin founded an unsubsidized company, Murray Valley Aerial Services. In June, the government subsidies for southern mail services were withdrawn. Palm Valley Expedition In early 1928, Larkin had fuel supplies carried by camel train from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, establishing depots along the route. On 4 July, Larkin and Frank Neale set off in two of Larkin's planes, to fly from Melbourne into Palm Valley, Northern Australia. After two days flight in, they spent about ten days exploration while contacting missionaries in the vicinity of Hermannsburg; the flight out took another four days. The flight seems to have been a survey preliminary to developing the Palm Valley into a resort or vacation center with government help. Downfall A contemporary description of Larkin noted that his glaring deepest eyes and pinched mouth displayed his impatience and lack of tact. Certainly, his public accusation of corruption against the secretary for the Department of Defence Malcolm Lindsay Shepherd in February 1929 was a decidedly undiplomatic means of furthering a government-supported business. The subsequent enquiry clearing Shepherd redounded to Larkin's detriment. In 1932, Larkin helped establish the Australian Air Convention as a means of forming national aviation policies. In December 1933, this unincorporated non- governmental body distributed 1,300 copies of a circular, including one mailed to Shepherd's successor, Sir George Pearce. The circular concerned the methods used to grant government contracts without requests for tenders. On 26 January 1934, the Western Mining Corporation and four of its directors sued the members of the Australian Air Convention, alleging false and malicious accusations contained in the circular by the Convention had damaged both Western and its directors. When the case went to trial in June 1934, Larkin and Convention Chairman W. T. Shaw attempted to prove they had no malicious intent. WMC's counsel entered into evidence both Larkin's unsuccessful prior accusation of Secretary Shepherd and a letter alleging corruption addressed to the Bribery and Secret Commissions Prevention League. WMC's Company Secretary and three members of the Board of Directors testified there were no aerial survey contract discussions. The three other members of the Convention publicly disavowed the circular and were dropped from the suit. The final weight of the ensuing loss of the suit fell entirely upon Larkin and Shaw. Their subsequent bankruptcies left Larkin as a salaried manager in his own liquidated company, Larkin Aircraft Supply Company. Larkin subsequently left for Europe in 1937. Second World War and beyond On 24 July 1939, Larkin was appointed a flight lieutenant in Class CC for service in the General Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was promoted to squadron leader in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 1 December 1941. On 10 April 1943, he relinquished his commission.

On 6 June 1945, he remarried, wedding widow H√©l√®ne Merley Castan in Paris. He would stay married to her until 1956. His postwar career took him to Germany and Switzerland as well as France; again, details are lacking. In 1957, he retired to the Channel Islands and became a human rights campaigner.

By pipes put on two paved inclines, the water was pumped up the 126 metres of the hill of Louveciennes. The water flowed into the reservoir at the summit of the tour du Levant (\\"East tower\\") at the north-eastern end of the aqueduct. Using gravity by a one metre wide and two metres deep canal, sealed inside with lead, the water was directed toward the tour du Jongleur (\\"tower of the Juggler\\") at the southern end of the aqueduct. From there, a siphon ensured the supply of a reservoir called r√©servoir des Deux Portes and the nearby tanks of Marly and Louveciennes. The aqueduct was retired from service in 1866 and replaced by underground pipes. During the Siege of Paris (1870-1871), the tour du Levant was used as an observation point by the future German emperor William I and the chancellor Bismarck.

Plot When Brian Carter's mother dies, he is surprised to learn that he has inherited The Sanctuary, home to her controversial experimental addiction treatment center. Having previously believed that the building burned to the ground years ago, Brian travels there with a group of friends and meets Haley, a mysterious friend of his mother, who acts as their guide through the impressive, monastery-like building. During their tour it becomes clear that something sinister lies beneath the surface. Despite their misgivings, they follow a secret passageway underground and come across strange and unsettling discoveries that trigger Brian's disturbing memories of his mother's research. Ultimately, they are confronted by her terrible secret: Brian's mother built a revolutionary machine that cured people of their addictions but, as a side effect, those addictions materialized in the form of mutant children hungry for human flesh. Sharing the dark bowels of the building with swarms of firefly-like creatures that they use to lure their victims into death traps, the mutant children begin a wild hunt, with the new visitors as their prey. Fighting to stay alive against the inconceivable, Brian and his friends soon realize that some things are better left hidden.

In modern-day Turkey the term continues to be in use: G√ºmr√ºk vergi ve resimleri (Turkish for customs taxes and duties). Customs duties were typically paid on the value of commodities; in the Ottoman empire, just as in modern commerce, this would fuel disagreements over the \\"value\\" of the goods being traded. As with other Ottoman taxes, collection could be \\"farmed out\\" to a contractor who would agree to pay a fixed amount, or a percentage, to the government. Sometimes the tax farmer might attempt to request customs duties on goods or traders which had previously been exempt. In the 17th century, g√ºmr√ºk resmi was capped at 3% for Dutch traders; but nonetheless, the emin might attempt to increase that, or to try other ways of calculating duty which would increase the amount payable. In the 18th century, the Ottoman empire attempted to enforce g√ºmr√ºk on all vessels sailing in and out of the Persian Gulf; however, this was increasingly difficult as ships could not be forced to call at the customs- post in the port of Muscat, local chiefs failed to pay g√ºmr√ºk from their ports promptly (or at all), and vessels from (or under the protection of) the great powers such as Britain were effectively exempted from g√ºmr√ºk. After 1795, the Sultan responded to this problem by encouraging a certain form of freebooting; the Suwaydi tribe were encouraged to settle at the Hormuz Strait, a bottleneck at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, and they were tacitly encouraged to raid any ship which could not prove it had paid g√ºmr√ºk resmi. Some farmers in border areas might attempt to evade livestock taxes by claiming to each government that their livestock were on the \\"other\\" side of the border; sultan Selim ordered in 1571 that g√ºmr√ºk resmi would have to be paid, but some tax evasion appears to have continued. Sometimes an emin might be stationed at a port or border crossing, to manage customs; this would be a g√ºmr√ºk emin.

DNA analysis has shown that the half-free morels, which appear nearly identical on a macroscopic scale, are a cryptic species complex, consisting of at least three geographically isolated species. Because de Candolle originally described the species based on specimens from Europe, the scientific name M. semilibera should be restricted to the European species. In 2012, Morchella populiphila was described from western North America, while Peck's 1903 species name Morchella punctipes was reaffirmed for eastern North American half-free morels. M. semilibera and the other half-free morels are closely related to the black morels (M. elata and others). A proposal has been made to conserve the name Morchella semilibera against several earlier synonyms, including Phallus crassipes, P. gigas and P. undosus. These names, sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries, have since been shown to be the same species as M. semilibera.

It is the area's largest bank in deposit market share and number of locations. First Security serves Gallatin County. The bank has branches in Bozeman, Belgrade, Three Forks, Big Sky, West Yellowstone, and Four Corners. First Security Bank is one of the top employers in Gallatin County and was recognized as Montana's Employer of Choice (over 25 employees) in 2013 by the Montana State Employer's Council (MSEC). Company history First Security Bank opened on Bozeman's Main Street in 1919 with four employees under the name \\"Security Bank and Trust\\". Thanks to the investment of local businessmen, the bank survived the Great Depression and continued to grow. Eventually, expanded staff moved to a new building just east of the original location in 1957. This building was financed by Robert Bradford and George Dieruf, owners of the Powderhorn. In the 1970s the banks's name was changed to the current First Security Bank, which better reflected the focus on loans and deposits versus trust services. The late 1990s through 2006 was a time of significant physical expansion for First Security. In 1994, a second Bozeman location was completed near the Montana State University campus. First Security Bank of Belgrade, an affiliate bank chartered by Inter-Mountain Bancorp, Inc., opened April 1, 1997. It became a branch of First Security Bank in December 1998. In 2000, the branch in Three Forks, formerly Security Bank of Three Forks, was added. In 2001, the merger of First Security Bank of West Yellowstone was completed. The merger of First State Bank of Fort Benton occurred in 2002. A branch built in Big Sky opened in December 2005. The newest branch in Bozeman, at the corner of Cottonwood and Huffine, opened in May 2006. First Security Bank added three additional branches in October, 2016 through a merger with Teton Banks. Located in Fairfield, Choteau, and Vaughn, the locations create added convenience for First Security customers throughout the Golden Triangle. In October, 2017 Inter-Mountain Bancorp, Inc. announced it had entered into an agreement to combine with the Glacier Bancorp family of banks. First Security Bank will officially be under the Glacier Bancorp umbrella as of March 1, 2018. The new relationship will eventually lead to First Security Bank‚Äôs Golden Triangle locations joining First Bank of Montana in Lewistown under the First Bank of Montana name. First Security‚Äôs Gallatin County locations will merge with Big Sky Western Bank under the First Security Bank name and brand.

The original church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, was built in the 13th century. The graveyard includes tombstones dating back to the 15th and 16th centuries. The monastery was renovated in the 16th century and again in 2008 after being destroyed in 1999. The Church building has been rebuilt on the existing and consolidated foundations using original building material from the ruins of the old church. The monastery is famous for the relics of the Saints Cosmas and Damian. The shrine at the monastery was said to provide a miraculous cure for eye diseases and mental and psychosomatic disorders. It is said to be \\"One of the most important cultural places for Serbian and Christian settlements in the Metohija region.\\" It was designated as Cultural Heritage of Serbia in 1954. The monastery was included into the Republic of Kosovo list of \\"Special Protective Zones\\" on 20 February 2008. History The earliest reference to the monastery dates to 1327, during the reign of Serbian king Stefan Deƒçanski. It was damaged during the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Muslims used the stones of the original building to construct a mosque in Prizren. It was rebuilt in the late 16th century following the reinstatement of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá. In the late 17th century, it was mentioned by Ragusan merchant Nikola Bo≈°koviƒá. =Kosovo War and destruction= Simultaneously with the KLA attack on Orahovac (17‚Äì20 July 1998), neighbouring Serb villages were attacked. Serb civilians were expelled from villages Opteru≈°a and Retimlje. With light artillery and machine guns, the KLA attacked for 45 minutes the Zoƒçi≈°te Monastery where thirty elderly Serbs had taken shelter, together with seven monks and a nun, and damaged the communal house with two grenades. Local Serbs told HRW that the monks resisted with four rifles for two hours before giving up. The KLA took everyone in the monastery to a school in nearby Semeti≈°te. Of the abducted Serbs, 35 were subsequently released on 22 July, and another ten on the night of 29‚Äì30 July. The fate of the other estimated forty abductees was unknown as of 2001. In 2005 remains of 47 victims were excavated in two mass graves. 2004 unrest The monastery was destroyed by the KLA after the Kosovo War on September 13/14, 1999, looting and then torching it. The relics of Saints Cosma and Damian were transferred to Sopoƒáani Monastery, and main monastery bell was thrown in the well. =Reconstruction= In October 2004, monastery reconstruction started, as Zoƒçi≈°te was important and historical cultural designation. Old stones and fragments of the destroyed church were used in reconstruction, and monastery is almost identical as it once was. In 2005, KFOR stopped reconstruction, with argument that local population opposes the restoration. When the ban was lifted, construction continued with the reconstruction of dormitories and main church building. On November 13, 2007 a bus carrying about 30 students was stoned outside the monastery. Description Salvaged old icon from the original 14th-century church The church, amidst the old Serbian graveyard, built over rectangular layout with three exterior faces, comprised a single nave, linear barrel vault, with an eastern apse in semicircular shape both in the interior and exterior facade. The material used for construction consisted of dressed stones, lime mortar for binding and stone-slate roofing. The church had two niches of prothesis and diaconicon, on the eastern wall next to an altar table. As the church when remodelled functioned as funerary chapel it had a table to keep a coffin and seats for people attending the funeral. Tell tale remains were seen in the vault and in a niche above the western entrance to the narthex; these were in the form of decorated frescos of a frieze of prophets and of the patrons SS Cosmas and Damian. When the church was destroyed in 1999, icons and liturgical vessels were retrieved and deposited in Velika Hoƒça for safe keeping. The statues and figures seen in the church consisted of: St Nicholas, St Paraskeva and two Holy Warriors and fragment of the fresco of one of the officiating archbishops, on the southern wall; the figures of St Sava and St Simeon Nemanja on the west wall; the north wall had depiction of \\"The Vision of St Peter of Alexandria\\"; the east wall had the figure of the Archangel Gabriel from the Annunciation; and a niche in the prothesis had the figure of an archdeacon.

Most roofers work in a variety of weather conditions, sometimes severe heat, and resist wearing an apparatus such as a safety harness. As a result of needing both an uncumbered work environment and the need to stay as cool as possible, roofers prefer the toe board due to its freeness of movement.

It was related to n√ºz√ºl; s√ºrsat was initially an obligation for the public to provide food and other supplies at a pre-fixed price which was unlikely to be favourable, or might even be merely symbolic. Istira was basically the same obligation, but supposedly at market price. Over time, n√ºz√ºl, s√ºrsat, and istira were all transformed into extraordinary cash taxes on people living near the route travelled by the army. During the late 17th and early 18th century - a period of continuous warfare for the Ottoman Empire - these extraordinary taxes soon became routine. This cash payment would be higher than the market value of the goods that were nominally required; for instance, during the campaigns on the eastern frontier in 1637-1638, the market price of barley was 23 ak√ßes per kile; but under the s√ºrsat system, villagers were obliged to sell barley to the army for 12 ak√ßes - and those who did not sell barley directly paid cash instead, varying from 20 to 60 ak√ßes. The easy convertibility of food supply obligations to cash payments makes it clear that s√ºrsat was effectively a tax. When goods were provided rather than cash, they might also include firewood and food for horses, as well as food for the army itself. The raya would be obliged to deliver supplies to where they were needed - in other words, they bore the transportation costs, which would otherwise be a large part of the cost of maintaining an army in the field. Ottoman taxation was subject to a complex family of overlapping fees and exemptions; some favoured groups were exempt from s√ºrsat, and in the Balkans many Christian settlements were exempted from s√ºrsat, apparently to discourage rebellion during warfare with neighbouring Christian kingdoms.

Most unusually for a British or Commonwealth ace, all his victories resulted in the destruction of his foe. Postwar, he became very involved in air racing, aviation exhibitions, and various competitive air events while continuing his military aviation career. First World War On 29 April 1916, Private Longton was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). On 12 July 1916, he was appointed a flying officer in the RFC; such appointments customarily were made at the end of a pilot's training. By mid-1918, he was posted to 85 Squadron as a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a pilot. On 3 June 1918, he was awarded the Air Force Cross by King George V. He would not score his first aerial victory until 7 July, when he destroyed a German Fokker D.VII fighter plane over Doulieu. He destroyed three more enemy planes in July: a Hannover two-seater reconnaissance craft on the 10th, an Albatros two-seater on 14 July, and a Pfalz D.III on 24 July. On 5 August, he became an ace, shooting down an Albatros reconnaissance aircraft in flames. His next success, on 22 August, not only gained him another victory, but was cited as a major reason for his receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross: Longton would next score on 8 October, when he destroyed an observation balloon south of Busigny. His dearth of victories in September is at least partially explained by the citation for a bar to his D.F.C. : Longton would finish October with a rush of victories. On 14 October, he destroyed a Fokker D.VII over Wassigny. On 29 October, he destroyed another Fokker D.VII at 1430 hours; half an hour later, he teamed with Thomas M. Harries and H. V. Evans to destroy an enemy reconnaissance two-seater, scoring a win for each flier. The following day, Longton destroyed a Fokker D.VII over Marville. Post-war On 16 April 1919, Longton gave up his commission in the Royal Air Force. On 3 June 1919, he was awarded a second bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross \\"for services rendered during the war.\\" He then re-enlisted and was granted a permanent commission as a lieutenant on 1 August 1919. On 1 November 1919, he was promoted to flight lieutenant. Longton stayed in the Royal Air Force, and was a participant in the RAF Pageant at Hendon on 3 July 1920. A photo in Flight Magazine shows him seated in a Fokker DVII adorned with Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp on the side of its cockpit. At one point, Longton flew aerobatics to much acclaim. Longton would participate in air exhibitions, races, and trials of various sorts through the 1920s right up until the year of his death. He competed in the 1920 Aerial Derby, but did not finish. Accounts of his feats are scattered throughout the aviation press. A few examples: * Longton was a competitor in the Seventh Aerial Derby on 7 August 1922; however, the relay race in which he entered was cancelled due to a preliminary accident to one of the competitors. * In mid-1923, he won the Grosvenor Challenge Cup air race in a Sopwith Gnu. * On 8 October 1923, Longton flew in the Lympne light aircraft trials in an English Electric Wren, sharing first place and ¬£1,500 in a competition to establish the most economical light, single-seat British aeroplane, flying on one gallon of fuel. * On 3 July 1925, he flew a Martinsyde in the Fourth Annual King's Cup, but retired early on. His racing and trials work seem not to have hurt his professional prospects. On 1 January 1924, he was promoted from flight lieutenant to squadron leader. In early 1927, Longton's aircraft was peppered by shotgun fire from a farmer while Longton was racing at a low altitude. On 6 June 1927, he was killed in a flying accident at Bournemouth, Dorset, England. He was buried under a headstone supplied by his wife, in Upavon cemetery, Wiltshire. He is also memorialized by a plaque erected by his old aviation comrades in 58 Squadron and Netheravon.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=longton&GSfn;=walter+&GSbyrel;=in&GSdy;=1927&GSdyrel;=in&GScntry;=5&GSob;=n&GRid;=60770812&df;=all& Retrieved 18 April 2011.

Plot Jaisingh Jadav (Marc Zuber), a Delhi-based journalist finds that even to this date, the flesh trade exists in a village in Madhya Pradesh, the victims being girls belonging to the Bhil tribe. Like any avid journalist, he travels to the village, followed by really buying a girl named Kamla (Deepti Naval) and takes her to his home in Delhi.

Funded and administered by the National Institute of Justice through a cooperative agreement with the University of North Texas Health Science Center's Center for Human Identification, all NamUs resources are provided to law enforcement, medical examiners, coroners, allied forensic professionals, and family members of missing persons. No-cost NamUs resources include technology, forensic and analytical services, investigative support, and local, regional, and online training programs. By bringing people, information, forensic science, and technology together, NamUs helps resolve missing and unidentified person cases across the country. Four states currently have passed legislation to require NamUs listings. These include New York, Connecticut, Tennessee and New Jersey. Services * Database technology which provides a secure, easy-to-use, centralized online database for information sharing, case management, advanced searching, and automatic matching tools to expedite case associations and resolutions. * Regional Program Specialists (RPSs) who hold Department of Justice security clearances, vet all professional users and case data, assist with the collection of biometric information, provide NamUs training, assist with the coordination and implementation of missing person day events, and provide investigative support to missing, unidentified, and unclaimed person cases. * Fingerprint services to scan, classify, upload, analyze, and compare fingerprint information submitted to NamUs, including collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for searching unidentified decedent prints through the FBI's Next Generation Identification national database. * Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA analyses through the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification's Missing Persons Unit. * Forensic odontology services to obtain, code, and upload dental information to NamUs. * Forensic anthropology services through the University of North Texas' Center for Human Identification's Missing Persons Unit. * Analytical services to assist with locating indication of life for persons reported missing to NamUs, locating family contact information for DNA collections and next of kin death notifications, and locating/vetting tips and leads related to missing and unidentified person cases. The number of missing persons and unidentified remains in the United States Over 600,000 individuals go missing in the United States every year. Many missing children and adults are quickly found, alive and well. However, tens of thousands of individuals remain missing for more than one year ‚Äì what many agencies consider ‚Äúcold cases‚Äù. A 2004 Bureau of Justice Statistics study found that each year, 4,400 unidentified bodies are recovered in the United States, with approximately 1,000 of those bodies remaining unidentified after one year. On June 15, 2018, there were over 14,000 missing person cases and over 12,000 unidentified person cases published in NamUs. The number of missing and unidentified remains in the United States has been deemed our nation's silent \\"mass disaster over time\\". History of NamUs In 2003, the National Institute of Justice began funding major efforts to maximize the use of DNA technology in the US criminal justice system, including in the investigation of missing and unidentified person cases. By 2005, the institute expanded its efforts with the ‚ÄúIdentifying the Missing Summit‚Äù, where criminal justice practitioners, forensic scientists, policymakers, and victim advocates defined major challenges in investigating and solving missing and unidentified decedent cases. As a result of that summit, the Deputy Attorney General created the National Missing Persons Task Force, which identified the need to improve access to information that would help solve missing and unidentified person cases. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) was created to meet that need. In 2007, the NamUs Unidentified Persons database was launched, providing medical examiners and coroners with a tool to store and share case information with criminal justice professionals and family members of missing persons across the country. The following year, the NamUs Missing Persons (MP) database was launched, and in 2009, the databases were connected for automatic case comparisons, expanding the power of NamUs to make associations between missing and unidentified persons. In 2011, daily management of the NamUs program was transitioned to the University of North Texas Health Science Center, with continued administration and oversight by the National Institute of Justice. Management through the Center for Human Identification at the university enhanced NamUs's ability to facilitate DNA services and enhanced the quality and quantity of DNA information entered into NamUs. In 2012, an Analytical Division was added to NamUs, offering criminal justice professionals additional resources to locate information on missing persons, locate family members for DNA sample collections and next of kin death notifications, and disposition tips and leads. Also in 2012, the NamUs AFIS/Fingerprint Unit was created, bringing additional in-house forensic services to NamUs, including a collaboration with the FBI's Latent Print Unit to search all unidentified decedent prints through the Next Generation Identification system. In late 2015, plans to perform a complete rebuild of the NamUs application began. Stakeholders from the law enforcement, medical examiner, coroner, non-profit, and public sector were interviewed as part of a Discovery Phase to plan the features and functionality of the upgraded system. Development work began in the first quarter of 2016 and culminated in the release of the NamUs 2.0 application in May 2018.

They produce secondary metabolites toxic to herbivores. Plant use of endophytic fungi in defense occurs when endophytic fungi, which live symbiotically with the majority of plants by entering their cells, are utilized as an indirect defense against herbivores.Strauss, S.Y. & Zangerl, A.R. (2003). Plant-insect interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. In: Plant- animal interactions: an evolutionary approach (Herrera, C.M. & Pellmyr, O., Eds.). Malden: Blackwell Publishing. pp. 77-106. In exchange for carbohydrate energy resources, the fungus provides benefits to the plant which can include increased water or nutrient uptake and protection from phytophagous insects, birds or mammals. Once associated, the fungi alter nutrient content of the plant and enhance or begin production of secondary metabolites.Dighton, J. (2003). Fungi in Ecosystem Processes. New York: Marcel Dekker. The change in chemical composition acts to deter herbivory by insects, grazing by ungulates and/or oviposition by adult insects. Endophyte-mediated defense can also be effective against pathogens and non-herbivory damage. This differs from other forms of indirect defense in that the fungi live within the plant cells and directly alter their physiology. In contrast, other biotic defenses such as predators or parasites of the herbivores consuming a plant are normally attracted by volatile organic compounds (known as semiochemicals) released following damage or by food rewards and shelter produced by the plant. These defenders vary in the time spent with the plant: from long enough to oviposit to remaining there for numerous generations, as in the ant-acacia mutualism. Endophytic fungi tend to live with the plant over its entire life.  Diversity of endophytic associations  Claviceps spp. fungus growing on wheat spikes, a common endophyte of the grasses. The fungal endophytes are a diverse group of organisms forming associations almost ubiquitously throughout the plant kingdom. The endophytes which provide indirect defense against herbivores may have come from a number of origins, including mutualistic root endophyte associations and the evolution of entomopathogenic fungi into plant- associated endophytes. The endomycorrhiza, which live in plant roots, are made up of five groups: arbuscular, arbutoid, ericoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizae. The majority of species are from the phylum Glomeromycota with the ericoid species coming from the Ascomycota, while the arbutoid, monotropoid and orchid mycorrhizae are classified as Basidiomycota.Peterson, R.L.; Massicotte, H.B. & Melville, L.H. (2004). Mycorrhizas: anatomy and cell biology. National Research Council Research Press. . The entomopathogenic view has gained support from observations of increased fungal growth in response to induced plant defenses and colonization of plant tissues. Examples of host specialists are numerous ‚Äì especially in temperate environments ‚Äì with multiple specialist fungi frequently infecting one plant individual simultaneously. These specialists demonstrate high levels of specificity for their host species and may form physiologically adapted host-races on closely related congeners. Piriformospora indica is an interesting endophytic fungus of the order Sebacinales, the fungus is capable of colonising roots and forming symbiotic relationship with every possible plant on earth . P. indica has also been shown to increase both crop yield and plant defence of a variety of crops(barley, tomato, maize etc.) against root-pathogens. However, there are also many examples of generalist fungi which may occur on different hosts at different frequencies (e.g. Acremonium endophytes from five subgenera of Festuca) and as part of a variety of fungal assemblages. They may even spread to novel, introduced plant species. Endophytic mutualists associate with species representative of every growth form and life history strategy in the grasses and many other groups of plants.Clay, K. (1988). Claviciptaceous fungal endophytes of grasses: coevolution and the change from parasitism to mutualism. In: Coevolution of Fungi with Plants and Animals (Hawksworth, D. & Pirozynski, K., eds.). London: Academic Press. The effects of associating with multiple strains or species of fungus at once can vary, but in general, one type of fungus will be providing the majority of benefit to the plant.  Mechanisms of defense  = Secondary metabolite production = Some chemical defenses once thought to be produced by the plant have since been shown to be synthesized by endophytic fungi. The chemical basis of insect resistance in endophyte-plant defense mutualisms has been most extensively studied in the perennial ryegrass and three major classes of secondary metabolites are found: indole diterpenes, ergot alkaloids and peramine.Betina, V. (1984). Indole derived tremorgenic toxins. In: Mycotoxins Production, Isolation, Separation and Purification (Betina, V., ed.). Developments in Food Science, Vol. 8. New York: Elsivier.Rutschmann, J. & Stadler, P.A. (1978). Chemical background. In: Ergot Alkaloids and Related Compounds (Berde, B. & Schild, H.O., eds.) Berlin: Springer-Verlag. Related compounds are found across the range of endophytic fungal associations with plants. The terpenes and alkaloids are inducible defenses which act similarly to defensive compounds produced by plants and are highly toxic to a wide variety of phytophagous insects as well as mammalian herbivores.Popay, A.J.; Prestidge, R.A.; Rowan, D.D. & Dymock, J.J. (1990). The role of Acremonia lolli mycotoxins in insect resistance of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). In: Proc. 1st Int. Symp. Acremonium/Grass interactions (Quisenberry, S.S. & Joost, R.E., eds.) Baton Rouge: Louisiana Agriculture Experiment Station.Prestidge, R.A. & Ball, O.J.-P. (1997). A catch 22: the utilization of endophytic fungi for pest management. In: Multitrophic Interactions in Terrestrial Systems (Gange, A.C. & Brown, V.K., eds.). Oxford: Blackwell Scientific. pp. 171-192. Peramine occurs widely in endophyte- associated grasses and may also act as a signal to invertebrate herbivores of the presence of more dangerous defensive chemicals. Terpenoids and ketones have been linked to protection from specialist and generalist herbivores (both insect and vertebrate) across the higher plants. Generalist herbivores are more likely than specialists to be negatively affected by the defense chemicals that endophytes produce because they have, on average, less resistance to these specific, qualitative defenses.Smith, S.E. & Read, D.J. (2008). Mycorrhizal symbiosis. (3rd ed.) London: Academic Press. Among the chewing insects, infection by mycorrhizae can actually benefit specialist feeders even if it negatively affects generalists. The overall pattern of effects on insect herbivores seems to support this, with generalist mesophyll feeders experiencing negative effects of host infection, although phloem feeders appear to be affected little by fungal defenses. Secondary metabolites may also affect the behaviour of natural enemies of herbivorous species in a multi-trophic defense/predation association. For instance, terpenoid production attracts natural enemies of herbivores to damaged plants. These enemies can reduce numbers of invertebrate herbivores substantially and may not be attracted in the absence of endophytic symbionts. Multi-trophic interactions can have cascading consequences for the entire plant community, with the potential to vary widely depending on the combination of fungal species infecting a given plant and the abiotic conditions. = Altered nutrient content = Due to the inherently nutrient-exchange based economy of the plant-endophyte association, it is not surprising that infection by fungi directly alters the chemical composition of plants, with corresponding impacts on their herbivores. Endophytes frequently increase apoplastic carbohydrate concentration, altering the C:N ratio of leaves and making them a less efficient source of protein.Richardson, M.D. (2000). Alkaloids of endophyte- infected grasses: defense chemicals or biological anomalies? In: Microbial Endophytes (Bacon, C.W.; White, J.F., eds.). New York: Marcel Dekker. pp. 323-340. This effect can be compounded when the fungus also uses plant nitrogen to form N-based secondary metabolites such as alkaloids. For example, the thistle gall fly (Urophora cardui) experiences reduced performance on plants infected with endophytic fungi due to the decrease in N-content and ability to produce large quantities of high-quality gall tissue. Additionally, increased availability of limiting nutrients to plants improves overall performance and health, potentially increasing the ability of infected plants to defend themselves.  Impacts on host plants  = Herbivory prevention = Studies of fungal infection consistently reveal that plants with endophytes are less likely to suffer substantial damage, and herbivores feeding on infected plants are less productive. There are multiple modes through which endophytic fungi reduce insect herbivore damage, including avoidance (deterrence), reduced feeding,Knoch, T.R.; Faeth, S.H. & Arnott, D.S. (1993). Fungal endophytes: plant mutualists via seed predation and germination. Bull. Ecol. Soc. Am. 74(Abstr.): 313. reduced development rate, reduced growth and/or population growth, reduced survival and reduced oviposition. Vertebrate herbivores such as birds, rabbitsSadler, K. (1980). Of rabbits and habitat, a long term look. Missouri Conservationist March: 4-7. and deer show the same patterns of avoidance and reduced performance. Even below-ground herbivores such as nematodes and root-feeding insects are reduced by endophyte infection.Clay, K. (1991). Fungal endophytes, grasses, and herbivores. In: Microbial mediation of plant-herbivore interactions (Barbosa, P.; Krischik, V.A. & Jones, C.G., eds.) New York: John Wiley and Sons. pp. 199-226. The strongest evidence for anti-herbivore benefits of fungal endophytes come from studies of herbivore populations being extirpated when allowed to feed only on infected plants. Examples of local extinction have been documented in crickets, larval armyworms and flour beetles. Yet chemical defenses produced by fungal endophytes are not universally effective, and numerous insect herbivores are unaffected by a given compound at one or more life history stages; larval stages are often more susceptible to toxins than adults. Even endophytes which purportedly provide some defense benefit to their hosts such as the Neotyphidium partner of many grass species in the alpine tundra do not always lead to avoidance or ill-effects on herbivores due to spatial variation in levels of consumption. = Mutualism-pathogenicity continuum = Not all endophytic symbioses confer protection from herbivores ‚Äì only some species associations act as defense mutualisms. The difference between a mutualistic endophyte and a pathogenic one can be indistinct and dependent on interactions with other species or environmental conditions. Some fungi which are pathogens in the absence of herbivores may become beneficial under high levels of insect damage, such as species which kill plant cells in order to make nutrients available for their own growth, thereby altering nutritional content of leaves and making them a less desirable foodstuff. Some endomycorrhizae may provide defense benefits but at the cost of lost reproductive potential by rendering grasses partially sterile with their own fungal reproductive structures taking precedence. This is not unusual among fungi, as non-endophytic plant pathogens have similar conditionally beneficial effects on defense. Some species of endophyte may be beneficial for the plants in other ways (e.g. nutrient and water uptake) but will provide less benefit as a plant receives more damage and not produce defensive chemicals in response. The effect of one fungus on the plant can be altered when multiple strains of fungi are infecting a given individual in combination. Some endomycorrhizae may actually promote herbivore damage by making plants more susceptible to it. For example, some oak fungal endophytes are positively correlated with the levels of damage from leaf miners (Cameraria spp.), although negatively correlated with number of larvae present due to a reduction of oviposition on infected plants, which partially mitigates the higher damage rate. This continuum between mutualism and pathogenicity of endophytic fungi has major implications for plant fitness depending on the species of partners available in a given environment; mutualist status is conditional in a way similar to pollination and can shift from one to the other just as frequently. = Fitness and competitive ability = Fungal endophytes which provide defensive services to their host plants may exert selective pressures favouring association through enhanced fitness relative to uninfected hosts. The fungus Neotyphodium spp. infects grasses and increases fitness under conditions with high levels of interspecific competition.Lane, G.A.; Christenses, M.J. & Miles, C.O. (2000). Coevolution of fungal endophytes with grasses: the significance of secondary metabolites. In: Microbial Endophytes (Bacon, C.W.; White, J.F., eds.). New York: Marcel Dekker. pp. 341-388. It does this through a combination of benefits including anti- herbivore defenses and growth promoting factors. The customary assumption that plant growth promotion is the main way fungal mutualists improve fitness under attack from herbivores is changing; alteration of plant chemical composition and induced resistance are now recognized as factors of great importance in improving competitive ability and fecundity. Plants undefended by chemical or physical means at certain points in their life histories have higher survival rates when infected with beneficial endophytic fungi. The general trend of plants infected with mutualistic fungi outperforming uninfected plants under moderate to high herbivory exerts selection for higher levels of fungal association as herbivory levels increase.Clay, K. (1997). Fungal endophytes, herbivores and the structure of grassland communities. In: Multitrophic Interactions in Terrestrial Systems (Gange, A.C. & Brown, V.K., eds.). Oxford: Blackwell Scientific. pp. 151-169. Unsurprisingly, low to moderate levels of herbivore damage also increases the levels of infection by beneficial endophytic fungi.Gange, A.C. (2007). Insect‚Äìmycorrhizal interactions: patterns, processes and consequences. In Ecological Communities: Plant Mediation in Indirect Interaction Webs (Ohgushi, T.; Craig, T.P. & Price, P.W., eds.), pp. 124‚Äì143. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. In some cases the symbiosis between fungus and plant reaches a point of inseparability; fungal material is transmitted vertically from the maternal parent plant to seeds, forming a near-obligate mutualism. Because seeds are an important aspect of both fecundity and competitive ability for plants, high germination rates and seedling survival increase lifetime fitness. When fitness of plant and fungus become tightly intertwined, it is in the best interest of the endophyte to act in a manner beneficial to the plant, pushing it further toward the mutualism end of the continuum. Such effects of seed defense can also occur in dense stands of conspecifics through horizontal transmission of beneficial fungi. Mechanisms of microbial association defense, protecting the seeds rather than the already established plants, can have such drastic impacts on seed survival that they have been recognized to be an important aspect of the larger ‚Äòseed defence theory‚Äô. = Climate change = The range of associated plants and fungi may be altered as climate changes, and not necessarily in a synchronous fashion. Plants may lose or gain endophytes, with as yet unknown impacts on defense and fitness, although generalist species may provide indirect defense in new habitats more often than not. Above-ground and below-ground associations can be mutual drivers of diversity, so altering the interactions between plants and their fungi may also have drastic effects on the community at large, including herbivores. Changes in distribution may bring plants into competition with previously established local species, making the fungal community ‚Äì and particularly the pathogenic role of fungus ‚Äì important in determining outcomes of competition with non-native invasive species. As carbon dioxide levels rise, the amplified photosynthesis will increase the pool of carbohydrates available to endophytic partners, potentially altering the strength of associations. Infected C3 plants show greater relative growth rate under high CO2 conditions compared to uninfected plants, and it is possible that the fungi drive this pattern of increased carbohydrate production. Levels of herbivory may also increase as temperature and carbon dioxide concentrations rise. However, should plants remain associated with their current symbiotic fungi, evidence suggests that the degree of defense afforded them should not be altered. Although the amount of damage caused by herbivores frequently increases under elevated levels of atmospheric CO2, the proportion of damage remains constant when host plants are infected by their fungal endophytes. The change in Carbon-Nitrogen ratio will also have important consequences for herbivores. As carbohydrate levels increase within plants, relative nitrogen content will fall, having the dual effects of reducing nutritional benefit per unit biomass and also lowering concentrations of nitrogen-based defenses such as alkaloids.Clay, K. (1994). The potential role of endophytes in ecosystems. In: Biotechnology of endophytic fungi of grasses. Boca Raton: CRC Press. pp. 73-86.  History of research  = Early recognition = The effects of endophytic fungi on the chemical composition of plants have been known by humans for centuries in the form of poisoning and disease as well as medicinal uses. Especially noted were impacts on agricultural products and livestock. Recognition and study of the mutualism did not begin in earnest until the 1980s when early studies on the impacts of alkaloids on animal herbivory confirmed their importance as agents of deterrence. Biologists began to characterize the diversity of endophytic mutualists through primitive techniques such as isozyme analysis and measuring the effects of infection on herbivores. Basic descriptive accounts of these previously neglected species of fungus became a major goal for mycologists, and a lot of research focus shifted to associates of the grass family (Poaceae) in particular, because of the large number of species which represent economically important commodities to humans. = Recent advances and future directions = In addition to continuing descriptive studies of the effects of infection by defense mutualist endophytes, there has been a sharp increase in the number of studies which delve further into the ecology of plant-fungus associations and especially their multi-trophic impacts. The processes by which endophytic fungi alter plant physiology and volatile chemical levels are virtually unknown, and limited current results show a lack of consistency under differing environmental conditions, especially differing levels of herbivory. Studies comparing the relative impacts of mutualistic endophytes on inducible defenses and tolerance show a central function of infection in determining both responses to herbivore damage. On the whole, molecular mechanisms behind endophyte-mediated plant defense has been an increasing focus of research over the past ten years. Since the beginning of the biotechnology revolution, much research has been also focused on using genetically modified endophytes to improve plant yields and defensive properties. The genetic basis of response to herbivory is being explored in tall fescue, where it appears the production of jasmonic acid may play a role in downregulation of the host plant's chemical defense pathways when a fungal endophyte is present. In some cases, fungi that are closely associated with their hosts have transferred genes for secondary metabolite production to the host genome, which could help to explain multiple origins of chemical defenses within the phylogeny of various groups of plants. This represents an important line of inquiry to pursue, especially in regards to understanding the chemical pathways that can be utilized in biotechnological applications.  Importance to humans  = Agriculture and livestock = The secondary chemicals produced by endophytic fungi when associated with their host plants can be very harmful to mammals including livestock and humans, causing more than 600 million dollars in losses due to dead livestock every year. For example, the ergot alkaloids produced by Claviceps spp. have been dangerous contaminants of rye crops for centuries. When not lethal, defense chemicals produced by fungal endophytes may lead to lower productivity in cows and other livestock feeding on infected forage. Reduced nutritional quality of infected plant tissue also lowers the performance of farm animals, compounding the effect of reduced feed uptake when provided with infected plant matter. Reduced frequency of pregnancy and birth has also been reported in cattle and horses fed with infected forage. Consequently, the dairy and meat-production industries must endure substantial economic losses. Fungal resistance to herbivores represents an environmentally sustainable alternative to pesticides that has experienced reasonable success in agricultural applications.West, C.P. & Gwinn, K.D. (1993). Role of Acremonium in drought, pest and disease tolerance of grasses. In: Proc. 2nd Int. Symp. Acremonium/grass interactions: plenary papers. (Hume, D.E.; Latch, G.C.M. & Easton, H.S., eds.) Palmerston North, NZ: AgResearch, Grasslanda Research Centre. The organic farming industry has embraced mycorrhizal symbionts as one tool for improving yields and protecting plants from damage. Infected crops of soybean, ribwort plantain, cabbage, banana, coffee bean plant and tomato all show markedly lower rates of herbivore damage compared to uninfected plants. Endophytic fungi show great promise as a means of indirect biocontrol in large-scale agricultural applications.Dent, D. (1991) Insect pest management. Wallingford, UK: CAB International. The potential for biotechnology to improve crop populations through inoculation with modified fungal strains could reduce toxicity to livestock and improve yields of human-consumed foods. The endophyte, either with detrimental genes removed or beneficial new genes added, is used as a surrogate host to transform the crops genetically. An endophyte of ryegrass has been genetically transformed in this way and used successfully to deter herbivores. Understanding how to mediate top-down effects on crop populations caused by the enemies of herbivores as well as bottom-up effects of chemical composition in infected plants has important consequences for the management of agricultural industries. The selection of endophytes for agricultural use must be careful and consideration must be paid to the specific impacts of infection on all species of pest and predators or parasites, which may vary on a geographic scale. The union of ecological and molecular techniques to increase yield without sacrificing the health of the local or global environment is a growing area of research. = Pharmaceutical = Ergotamine, a mycotoxin produced by Claviceps spp. which infects rye and related grasses, causing poisoning of livestock and humans Many secondary metabolites from endophyte- plant interactions have also been isolated and used in raw or derived forms to produce a variety of drugs treating many conditions. The toxic properties of ergot alkaloids also make them useful in the treatment of headaches and throughout the process of giving birth by inducing contractions and stemming hemorrhages.Black, M.H. & Halmer, P. (2006). The encyclopedia of seeds: science, technology and uses. Wallingford, UK: CABI. pp. 226. . Drugs used to treat Parkinson's Disease have been created from isolates of ergot toxins, although health risks may accompany their use. Ergotamine has also been used to synthesize lysergic acid diethylamide because of its chemical similarity to lysergic acid. The generally chemically-based defense properties of endophytic fungi make them a perfect group of organisms to search for new antibiotic compounds within, as other fungi have in the past yielded such useful drugs as penicillin and streptomycin and plants use their antibiotic qualities as a defense against pathogens.Gray, W.D.

It was first performed at the Donaueschingen Festival in West Germany in 1960. At this first performance, it was well received by the audience who demanded an encore.Avis The title of the piece, Anaklasis means \\"Refraction of Light\\". This idea is expressed through the continuous modulation of timbre in the piece. Anaklasis is also a metrical term used in Greek poetry. Penderecki's biographer, Wolfram Schwinger noted that, \\"Penderecki has indeed admitted, in his programme note for Donaueschingen 1960 when Anaklasis was first performed, that this metrical definition inspired the rhythmic procedure of the central section, and led to the ideas of rotation and arhythmical progressions as factors governing the rhythms generally.\\"Schwinger, . History Anaklasis was first sketched and scored in the winter of 1959/60 during Penderecki's first visit to Italy. Schwinger said of the piece, it is \\"a document of extreme differentiated and multifarious composition in sound-patterns, a work of the most complicated noise-structures.\\" Penderecki sought \\"the seamless transformation of sound-qualities, the flexible passage from sound to noise and vice versa.\\" It is one of Penderecki's first pieces to use the special effects and inventive notations for which he is most known. Special effects he uses in the piece include dropping of a pencil on the strings of the piano and stroking the strings with jazz brushes. Form The form of the pieces is tripartite, with an A section which is strings alone, a B section which is percussion alone, and a C section which is a mixture of the two. The A section begins with five solo strings which begin and add to a pianissimo tone cluster in sequence starting with a solo viola's a. Larger groups of strings superimpose sforzandi on these entrances. Penderecki uses a large variety of articulations and string techniques to vary the color and texture of the first section which is characterized by continuity of noise and sound. Groups of strings play clusters of pitch, some definite and some indefinite, which contrast in timbre by the use of harmonics, tremolo, vibrato, col legno, pizzicato, and sul ponticello. In addition to timbre, the strings contrast in dynamic and register. Penderecki carefully transitions into the percussion B section with relative smoothness in opposition to the contrast in timbre. The B section generally has a somewhat smooth and even sound, but this is created by an extremely complex combination of rhythmic microstructures. On a micro scale, the section is characterized by rhythmic cancrizans, canons, and other procedural units. As with the A section, a large variety of timbres are executed through the large number of instruments and playing techniques. The piece transitions into the C section by reducing the orchestra in sequence until it is only ten violins playing pppp in a tight tone cluster. In this last section, Penderecki blends the strings and percussion with a combination of percussion sounds, string tremolo glissandi, and unconventional piano techniques. The piece ends with a chord played pizzicato on the inside of the piano. Scoring and notation The piece is scored for 20 violins, 8 violas, 8 celli, 6 double basses, celesta, harp, piano, and a large percussion section including xylorimba, congas, wooden-drums, vibraphone, bongos, bells, cymbals, glockenspiel, tom-toms, triangle, gong, tam-tam, and timpani to be played by six percussionists. Additionally, the pianist is responsible for playing wooden claves or rumba-sticks. The tempi in the beginning and end of the piece are noted in durations of seconds. The middle section uses more conventional metronome marks which range from quarter note equals 44 to quarter note equals 80.

Unlike Christianity, in which some strands have viewed poverty as virtuous and desirable, Jews have generally viewed poverty negatively. Jacobs and Greer assert, \\"In general, Jewish texts have portrayed poverty as an unjustifiable burden\\". In contrast to the consistently negative view of poverty, Kravitz and Olitzky describe a rapidly changing attitude towards acceptance of wealth as desirable as the Hebrews transitioned from being nomadic shepherds to farmers, then ultimately to city dwellers. In Kol ben Levi, the author writes, \\"There are two trials before the individual: the test of wealth and the test of poverty... both are difficult... but the test of wealth is greater than (the test of) poverty.\\"Kol ben Levi Cosimo Perrotta points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Tanakh (Sacred Scriptures, so-called \\"Old Testament\\"). Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them. Poverty Ronald Eisenberg writes that, unlike the classical Christian view, \\"the Rabbis saw no virtue in poverty\\". Lifshitz asserts that, \\"very rarely in Judaism is poverty associated with righteousness\\". Instead of being considered virtuous and desirable, poverty was viewed as \\"pointless suffering\\". Similarly, Cosimo Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Tanakh. However, Ethics of the Fathers states: \\"Such is the way of Torah: Bread with salt you shall eat, water in small measure you shall drink, and upon the ground, you shall sleep; live a life of deprivation and toil in Torah. If so you do, \\"fortunate are you, and good is to you\\" (Psalms 128:2): Fortunate are you in this world, and it is good to you in the World To Come.\\" =Charity= alt= Tzedakah ( or ·π¢'daqah in Classical Hebrew (; ), is a Hebrew word literally meaning \\"justice\\" or \\"righteousness\\" but commonly used to signify \\"charity\\",Rabbi Hayim Halevy Donin; 'To Be A Jew'. Basic Books, New York; 1972, pp. 48. though it is a different concept than charity because tzedakah is an obligation and charity is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity. It is based on the Hebrew word (◊¶◊ì◊ß, tzedek) meaning \\"righteousness\\", \\"fairness\\" or \\"justice\\", and it is related to the Hebrew word Tzadik meaning \\"righteous\\" as an adjective (or \\"righteous individual\\" as a noun in the form of a substantive). In Judaism, tzedakah refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasises are important parts of living a spiritual life. Maimonides says that, while the second-highest form of tzedakah is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients, the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient supporting himself, instead of living upon others. Unlike philanthropy or charity, which is completely voluntary, tzedakah is seen as a religious obligation, which must be performed regardless of financial standing, and must even be performed by poor people. Tzedakah is considered to be one of the three main acts that can annul a less than favourable heavenly decree. =Obligation to avoid poverty= Lifshitz asserts that, because poverty is something to be avoided, Jews are exhorted to earn their living through gainful employment. Jewish law calls upon Jews to do everything in their power to avoid becoming a burden on others. They are to be responsible for their own welfare and not to rely on the community to provide for them. Although the wealthy are called upon to be charitable to the poor, Lifshitz insists that this does not absolve the poor from their responsibility to earn a living. He argues that the Law does not mandate redistribution of wealth and that, in Judaism, the property of the wealthy is theirs to do with entirely as they please. =Protection of the poor= Although poverty is neither virtuous nor desirable, Judaic Law commands that the poor are to be respected and protected. According to Jacobs and Greer, \\"The overarching Jewish attitude toward the poor can be best summed up in a single word: achikha (your brother). Jews are enjoined by the Torah to resist any temptation to view the poor as somehow different from themselves. The Tanakh sets forth numerous protections of the poor. As an example of such protections, Perotta points out that the poor were protected from being exploited when in debt. Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was \\"not only to protect the poor but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands\\". In essence, the poor man is \\"protected by God\\". Kravitz and Olitzky cite the Jubilee (yoveil) and the sh'mitah as examples of commandments in the Torah designed to protect the poor. Wealth According to Joseph Lifshitz, \\"Jewish tradition insists that man can, and should, have a powerful impact on the material world.\\" Perrotta asserts that material wealth is highly valued in the Tanakh; the Hebrews seek it and God promises to bless them with it if they will follow his commandments. Joseph Francis Kelly writes that biblical writers portray God as enabling men such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Solomon to achieve wealth and that this wealth was considered a clear sign of divine favour. Kelly notes that the Old Testament also insisted on the rich aid the poor. Prophets such as Amos castigated the rich for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy. In summary, Kelly writes, \\"the Old Testament saw wealth as something good, but warned the wealthy not to use their position to harm those with less. The rich had an obligation to alleviate the sufferings of the poor.\\" Evolution of attitudes towards wealth and poverty in the Tanakh In contrast to the consistently negative view of poverty, Kravitz and Olitzky describe a rapidly changing attitude towards acceptance of wealth as desirable as the Hebrews transitioned from being nomadic shepherds to farmers and ultimately to city dwellers. They assert that the three divisions in the Tanakh starting with Abraham can be viewed as representing three chronological periods in Jewish history: the wilderness, the land and the city. The Hebrews are depicted in the Tanakh first as nomadic shepherds, then as farmers and finally as urban dwellers. Kravitz and Olitzky assert that, during the time of the Patriarchs through the years in the wilderness, wealth seemed to have been \\"held in common with no real distinctions between the rich and the poor\\". However, they note that the possibility for individual wealth arose as the Hebrews transitioned from a nomadic pastoral society to a more agrarian economy. They cite early prophets such as Amos, who viewed themselves as the heirs of the pastoral tradition and spoke out against those who oppressed the poor. The transition of Jewish society to an urban economy in the Hellenistic period intensified the societal issues surrounding poverty and wealth. Kravitz and Olitzky characterize rabbinic Judaism as \\"the Judaism of the city\\" rather than that of the shepherd or the farmer. As such, rabbinical Judaism found it necessary to address the needs of business and commerce including the need to raise money and protect capital investments. As an example of such accommodations, Kravitz and Olitzky cite Hillel's invention of p'rozbol, a legal fiction to nullify the requirements of the sh'mitah. According to Joseph Lifshitz, \\"Jewish tradition insists that man can, and should, have a powerful impact on the material world.\\" Individual charity and public welfare Aaron Levine comments that although the concept of public welfare is an integral part of the modern state, its historical origins are relatively recent, from the late 19th century. According to Levine, the key concept of the welfare state is that voluntarism alone does not sufficiently address the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged and so government steps in to complement private efforts by establishing programs to guarantee a minimum standard of living and to protect individuals against certain adverse events. Levine points out that, in Judaism, these principles can be traced back to Talmudic times (300 B.C.E. to 500 C.E.) and are embodied in Jewish Law (Halakah). Levine characterizes the Judaic approach to social welfare as a \\"dual anti-poverty system, consisting of private and public components\\". =Emergence of organized public charities= Lifshitz writes that \\"the concept of welfare in Jewish law rests primarily on various socio-agricultural commandments of the Torah\\". He cites commandments that mandate the reservation of part of the harvest for the poor. However, he notes that, although the Torah explicitly commands charity to the poor, there are very few specific commandments that promulgate charity outside of the provisions that are tied to agriculture. Lifshitz surmises that the general commandment mandating charity combined with the agriculture-related provisions may have been adequate to provide for the poor in an agrarian economy but, as Jewish society became increasingly urban in a Hellenistic society, the poor lost the lifeline formerly provided by the commandments that were tied to an agricultural society. Since the urban poor no longer had access to the fields, the commandments that mandated that a portion of the harvest to be set aside for them were no longer suitable for providing for their needs. This required the rabbis to expand the doctrine of charity to provide not only food but also money and other means of subsistence. One example of this was the institution of the custom of donating one-tenth of all profits to charity, along with the model of the agricultural tithes for the poor. According to Lifshitz, the shift from an agrarian society to an urban one enabled a transformation of charity from the independent actions of individuals to the concerted efforts of groups working in an organized fashion. Jewish communal life was modelled after the Hellenistic polis and among the public functionaries were collectors and disbursers of communal charity (gabbaim). Lifshitz notes that even though the institutionalization of communal charity competed with \\"the personal and individual character of charity\\", this existence of communal charity did not relieve the individual from his personal obligation to support the needy. Thus, although the community collected welfare taxes from its members, this represented a minimum level of charitable giving and was not intended to supplant or displace personal charitable donations to friends or relatives. Philanthropy Julius Rosenwald Philanthropy is an important part of Jewish culture, and many prominent Jews have made large donations to charitable causes. Derek Penslar speculates that the philanthropic tradition in the Jewish community originated in the early nineteenth century because the Jewish middle class were embarrassed by poor Jews, and were worried that the Jewish peddlers and vagrants would endanger the recent gains in status - so Jewish activists prohibited begging and supported aid for the poor. Jewish community leaders provided funds to train Jewish youths in farming and handicrafts.Penslar, p. 6 Retail magnate Julius Rosenwald donated a large amount of money to support the education of African-Americans. Jacob Schiff provided funds to help new Jewish √©migr√©s from Russia and Europe settle in the United States.Perry, p. 152 Marvin Perry quotes Jewish banker Otto Kahn as justifying his philanthropy by saying \\"I must atone for my wealth\\". Jerry Muller suggests that the Jewish inclination for philanthropy is partially due to a desire to offset resentment that may be felt by those not as wealthy.Muller, pp. 130-131 In the 1860s and 1870s, Zionists asked the Rothschilds to buy the land of Palestine for the Jews.Penslar, pp. 154-155 James A. de Rothschild paid for construction of the Israeli Knesset building as a gift to the State of Israel and the Supreme Court of Israel building was donated to Israel by Dorothy de Rothschild.\\"Dorothy de Rothschild, 93, Supporter of Israel\\" (obituary), The New York Times, 13 December 1988. Retrieved 19 June 2008. The Rothschilds also donated to non-Jewish causes, such as an observatory for Vienna observatory.

There he played for the college cricket team. Battersby represented Suffolk in the 1913 Minor Counties Championship, playing a single match against Lincolnshire. Battersby was mentioned in the London Gazette in February 1914 as having graduated from the Royal Military College with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. After graduating he joined the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment who he served in the First World War within the regiments 1st Battalion. He was once again mentioned in a supplement to the Gazette in 1920, detailing his special appointment to Vice Captain while still serving in the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment. A decade later he made his first-class debut for the Europeans (India) against the Parsees, before playing a further first-class match in that 1923/24 season against the Hindus. Returning to England once more, he played a further first- class match in 1926 for the Army against Oxford University. In his three first-class appearances he scored 110 runs at a batting average of 18.33, with a high score of 41. With the ball he took 2 wickets at a bowling average of 63.00. He later played Minor Counties Championship cricket for Devon, making his debut for the county in the 1930 Minor Counties Championship against Dorset. He continued to play Minor counties cricket for Devon until the following season. Battersby was in Devon as the Commanding Officer of the 2nd Battalion of The Devonshire Regiment. By 1940, Battersby was a Colonel in charge of the Infantry Record and Pay Office in Exeter. Later in 1940, he was promoted to Acting Brigadier and in November 1940 he was placed as the commanding officer of the 216th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), a Home Defence brigade which formed part of the Northumberland County Division. He held the position until 1 July 1941. In 1943 he was promoted to Honorary Brigadier on the date of his retirement.

He administered from 1569, the R√ºgenwalde district. From 1600 until his death, he ruled in Pomerania-Stettin.  Life  Barnim was the sixth child of Duke Philip I of Pomerania-Wolgast and his wife Maria of Saxony, Duchess of Pomerania. Philip died in 1560 and was survived by five of his sons; in addition to Barnim, they were his older brothers John Frederick (1542‚Äì1600), Bogislaw XIII (1544‚Äì1606) and Ernest Louis (1545‚Äì1592) and Barnim's younger brother Casimir VI (1557‚Äì1605). A guardianship government was set up for all the brothers. It consisted of the Lord Chamberlain Ulrich von Schwerin as a regent and a regency council of eleven people. Barnim and his brother Ernest Louis studied from 1563 at the University of Wittenberg, where they lived until 1565 at the home of a Martin Luther, the son of the reformer Martin Luther. In Wittenberg he served as Rector in the summer semester of 1564. In 1569 government in Pomerania was reorganized. Duke Barnim IX, who had no surviving sons, abdicated in favour of his second cousins John Frederick and Barnim X. Barnim waived the co-regency and agreed with his brother that he would rule the district of R√ºgenwalde. On 25 July 1569, the division of Pomerania was settled in the Treaty of Jasenitz. Also in 1569, a marriage with a Polish princess was planned, but this did not come about. In R√ºgenwalde Barnim reigned since 1569 in quiet seclusion with reasonable economy. In 1581 he married Anna Maria of Brandenburg, a daughter of Elector John George of Brandenburg. The marriage produced no children. After John Frederick's death of in 1600 Barnim succeeded him as ruler of Pomerania- Stettin. In 1602 he moved from R√ºgenwalde to the capital city of Stettin. In R√ºgenwalde, he was succeeded by his younger brother Casimir VI. Barnim didn't enjoy governing Pomerania-Stettin. John Frederick had lived beyond his means, leaving substantial debts and districts pledged to his creditors. Barnim cut expenses, which made him unpopular. He died on 1 September 1603 in Stettin, and was buried in the Castle Church in Stettin. He left no children. His widow Anna Maria died in 1618 in her Wittum in Wolin. Normally, Barnim's younger brother Casimir would have succeeded him as ruler of Pomerania-Stettin. However, Casimir in decided favour of his older brother Bogislaw XIII, who, in turn, appointed his son Philip II as Regent.  Numeral  Counting the rulers of the House of Griffins has always been complicated. From ancient times there were differences, which caused some confusion.Martin Wehrmann: Genealogy of the Pomeranian Dukes, Verlag Leon Sauniers Buchhandlung, Stettin 1937, p. 15 The modern interpretation of Barnim as \\"the tenth\\" results if one counts only the members of the House of Griffins, who reached adulthood. If one counts even with those who deceased as a child, he would be Barnim XII. This numeral was common in older literature.

Strictly speaking, the Islamic law forbade alcohol, so there were no alcohol taxes in the early empire. However, the Ottoman Empire acquired increasingly large non-Muslim populations, and inherited the taxes and customs of conquered territories; so in the seventeenth century an alcohol tax for non-Muslims was inaugurated. There were, subsequently, complex changes to taxation of alcohol (and in some cases taxes were abolished or replaced with something else, only to be re- established later); but these different taxes were generally all known as m√ºskirat resmi. Tax farming usually allowed tax collection to be done by a non-Muslim contractor, to avoid the need for a Muslim civil servant to be directly involved in the alcohol trade. There was also a zecriye resmi - a tax on \\"prohibited goods\\" - applied to alcohol sold in markets in the eighteenth century. M√ºskirat resmi persisted in the tanzimat era; the Ministry of Finance established a separate department (zecriye emaneti) to collect revenues from alcohol taxation. Tax reforms simplified the rate at 20%, and imported alcohol was subject to another m√ºskirat charge (instead of customs), which ranged from 10% to 12%. In 1861, the general m√ºskirat tax was reduced from 20% to 10% - but alcohol sellers were required to pay for additional permits (ruhsatname; the cost was a proportion of their rent). Shortly afterwards, the rate increased to 15%. Towards the very end of the empire, further tax changes favoured beer production over wine or rakƒ±. Only in 1926 were alcoholic drinks made legal for Muslims (in what was, by then, Turkey); manufacturing and distribution continued under government monopoly. Christian priests and monks were generally exempt from m√ºskirat resmi on alcoholic drinks for their own personal use, and also for masses.

Her port of registry was London. She was employed on routes between the United Kingdom and the Middle East, as shown by her occasional mentions in The Times in connection with one of her crew being stabbed to death in Port Said, Egypt, in October 1928, and a report of her having trouble with her condenser at Port Said in February 1932.

Rear-Admiral Wells, of the Third Cruiser Squadron, raised the issue with naval authorities at Palma, Majorca, who admitted that their aircraft had been involved. They claimed the ship had not been displaying any colours, which was denied by the British. This information was passed back to London, which ordered British Ambassador to Spain Sir Henry Chilton to raise the issue at the Nationalist headquarters in Salamanca. Markings on the aircraft that attacked British Corporal were those of Nationalist forces. General Franco denied that his aircraft had been involved, and further denied that the naval authorities in Palma had admitted involvement. The French Government announced that it would provide escort for French ships sailing between Algeria and Marseilles.

He was educated at St. George's College, Quilmes, and began his rugby union career playing for the Old Georgian Club in Buenos Aires. He travelled to Britain to continue his education at Queens' College, Cambridge and was selected to play for Cambridge University R.U.F.C. in The Varsity Match twice, playing on the wing in 1947 and at fullback in 1948. Holmes returned to Argentina in 1948 as part of the 1948 Oxford-Cambridge rugby union tour of Argentina, a touring team made up of players from both Cambridge University RUFC and Oxford University RFC which won all nine of its tour matches, including two against the Argentina national team. Holmes's form for Cambridge University in the 1948‚Äì49 season led to two appearances in the trial matches for the England team and also an invitation to play for the Barbarians in their annual fixture against Leicester. His performance in the second trial match clinched his selection at fullback in England's team for their opening match of the 1949 Five Nations Championship against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park and he retained his place for the whole championship. Holmes won four caps for England and scored a conversion in each match against Ireland and France for a total of four points. After playing on the Barbarians' 1949 tour of South Wales, Holmes returned to live in Argentina and was selected for the national team after only two games for Old Georgians. He was capped twice for Argentina against France in August and September 1949 but did not score any points.

They design and market products and services that low-income farmers purchase and use to help increase their incomes. The organisation sells foot-powered irrigation pumps, water storage tanks, drip irrigation systems, solar lighting and farm advisory services. Proximity distributes its products and services through a network of private sector agro-dealers and independent village-level agents that reaches approximately 80 percent of Myanmar's rural population. The products are designed to help farmers grow higher value crops and significantly increase their annual incomes. Since starting in 2004, more than 110,000 Proximity products have been purchased by farm households in Myanmar. Following the disaster of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the organisation became active in designing and implementing humanitarian relief and recovery efforts for entire communities. It is a 501(c)3 non-profit organisation registered in California with operations in Myanmar. Approach Proximity Designs uses a design approach to improve the incomes and well-being of rural families in Myanmar. They employ professional designers, engineers and ethnographers to discover unmet needs and opportunities for new products and services. The organisation operates a local design lab in Myanmar where its product designers create and test multiple prototypes with the goal of developing products that a) provide value to rural customers by increasing household productivity and incomes; and, b) are affordable for families earning $2 per day or less. Products reach villages nationwide through a distribution network of private agro-dealers and independent village agents. After-sales support and repair services are also offered to user households. Proximity conducts annual surveys to measure customer satisfaction and to document improvements in farm family incomes. History Proximity Designs was co-founded Jim Taylor and Debbie Aung Din, initially as a country program under International Development Enterprises (IDE) in 2004. The new entity was established as a wholly independent organisation in 2008 and renamed Proximity Designs. Mr. Taylor and Ms. Aung Din, both graduates of Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government, were named Rainer Arnold Fellows in 2007-08, and received a 2012 Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship. Proximity has partnered with Stanford University‚Äôs Hasso Plattner Institute of Design‚Äôs, Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability course since 2007. The organisation has over 800 full-time staff in Myanmar with its central office located in Yangon. The US office is located in Los Angeles. To date, Proximity Designs has helped 2.5 million rural people through its products, services and farm recovery efforts in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis (2008). Products and services Proximity Design‚Äôs portfolio of products and services are marketed under the Yetagon brand in Myanmar and include: * Foot-operated irrigation pumps that draw water from wells, streams or ponds. Approximate capacity is 1,200 gallons per hour. * Gravity-fed drip irrigation systems consisting of low-cost extruded plastic tape and small micro-tubes connected to an elevated water storage tank. A single drip system is designed to irrigate a 1/8 acre plot but can be linked to other systems to cover an acre. * Portable water storage tanks made from plastic tarpaulin material, commonly used as elevated tanks as part of Proximity‚Äôs gravity-fed drip irrigation systems. These tanks come in three different sizes ‚Äì 100, 150 and 250 gallons. * Farm advisory services featuring training in selected low- cost, simple agricultural practices that increase yields and protect farmers against losses caused by pests, diseases and overuse of pesticides. Proximity Designs also designs and implements humanitarian village stimulus programs that build community infrastructure while offering wage employment to economically stressed villages. Since 2008, more than 1,000 village projects have been completed in the cyclone-hit Irrawaddy Delta and the drought-prone central Dry Zone region of Myanmar. Proximity Designs engages in field analysis of rural economic conditions and produces reports of findings. Statistics Proximity has sold more than 110,000 products, with an estimated 400,000 people across rural Myanmar achieving higher incomes. The three-year increase in income for a typical irrigation pump user is 300 percent, or $600.

During service in the United States Peace Corps, Boly worked with local residents on micro-business projects. Change Management Large organizations coalease into risk-averse environments slow to address challenges. Government agencies typically follow a course of inaction born of suspicion for change and no requirement for accountability. Leading organizational culture change requires communication, champions and resources. Managing change that sticks involves developing a common team language, shared productivity expectations and may require acceptance of interim setbacks while trending to success. Managing a team of diverse and confident tech creators, as well as the requisite group of experienced bureaucrats, offered Boly the opportunity to apply egalitarian communication to a previously stove-piped, status-fixated information environment. By modeling change processes to staff and others, his management experiments offer a path to other government leaders in the digital era. Social Media Advocate Using social media for 21st century diplomacy carries a certain element of risk. \\"It's better to launch and learn and be a bit more entrepreneurial, without worrying that the stakes are too high,\\" says Richard Boly, State's director of eDiplomacy. During interviews, Boly advances the notion of civil society, global open government and collaboration among U.S. government agencies. Boly leads the team charged with developing the technical tools and training expertise to enable the U.S. Department of State to use professional networking platforms,http://www.federalnewsradio.com/index.php?nid=15&sid;=1908686 blogs, wikis and image sharing, to list just a few 21st century communications tools, effective and efficient government has an opportunity to thrive.

USYCA promotes cricket in America by donating cricket sets and instruction to schools, at no cost to the schools, through its Schools Program. USYCA has 60 member organizations: 21 Affiliates, which are organizations that are primarily engaged in youth cricket activities, and 39 Associates, which are organizations that support the USYCA mission, but are primarily engaged in other activities. USYCA is a program partner with the President‚Äôs Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and is a tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. History USYCA was founded in April 2010 by Jamie Harrison, Edward Fox and Rakesh Kallem. The previous month, DreamCricket.com, a US-based cricket website and online retailer, had agreed to donate ten cricket sets for placement in American schools under a pilot program directed by Harrison. After receiving an invitation from Physical Education instructor Charles Silberman, Highland Park Elementary School in Prince George's County, Maryland became the first school to receive a cricket set from USYCA in May 2010. In June and July, summer camps were the beneficiaries of USYCA donations, as schools were no longer in session. By the end of the summer, however, the Prince George's County school system had extended a welcome to USYCA, as had schools in Baltimore City. In the Fall of 2010, other jurisdictions in Maryland signed on, such as Kent and Queen Anne's counties on Maryland's Eastern Shore. USYCA President Jamie Harrison instructs PE teachers in Howard County, Maryland in March 2011 On 24 June it was announced that the C.C. Morris Cricket Library Association had agreed to fund the organization's infrastructure expenses, such as liability insurance and fees associated with the securing of federal tax-exempt status, up to a maximum of $5000. This was followed on 13 July with the announcement that DreamCricket.com had raised its pledge to 100 sets, ensuring USYCA of a useful supply of high-quality children's sets with which to approach school systems. This allowed the organization to break free of the time-consuming process of placing sets in one school at a time. Another key development that summer was the introduction to USYCA of Maria Grossi, and DTY Pty Ltd., an Australian firm that was the supplier of cricket sets and apparel to Cricket Australia's MILO In2Cricket program. The referral came by way of Rebecca Mulgrew of CA, who first came into contact with Harrison in 2009 while he was coaching the cricket team at Cardinal Gibbons School in Baltimore. By August, DTY was in discussions with USYCA that would result in the donation of 500 custom-made cricket sets, designed especially for the USYCA Schools Program. These sets would eventually be named the American Cricket Champ, and was the first set ever produced specifically for the American market. American Cricket Champ set Also that summer, USYCA produced its constitution, which was largely based upon the USACA document, and in August the organization elected its first office holders. Shortly thereafter, Michael Thomas of Maryland, a member of the British Officers Cricket Club and the C.C. Morris group, was appointed as USYCA's first treasurer. Chase and Nathan Bracken During these early months, individuals were volunteering to lead state youth cricket organizations for USYCA, so that by the end of August, USYCA was represented in 16 US states. In September, the first three USYCA standing committees were established: membership, finance and constitution/by-laws. Mike Young In the Fall of 2010, USYCA began placing cricket sets in schools in Maryland, and international cricket celebrities, such as Australia's Nathan Bracken and Damien Martyn, posed for photos wearing USYCA tee shirts. Bracken included his son, Chase (also in a USYCA shirt), in his portrait. Also that fall, a USYCA instructional video was produced by Rohit Kulkarni and City Lights Films, and was added to the USYCA YouTube page. This three-part video, \\"Introducing Cricket To Children In The United States,\\" was viewed thousands of times in its first year online, and became key in delivering the USYCA formula to those spreading cricket to new demographics. In November, USYCA was granted Associate Member status by USACA, and made itself eligible for recognition and support from the International Cricket Council. This eligibility soon paid off handsomely, as the USYCA Schools Program was awarded the top prize in the Junior Participation Initiative category by the ICC America's region in the 2010 Pepsi ICC Development Programme Awards. This award in January 2011 came only days after Mike Young, the American fielding coach for the Australian national cricket team, had come out in public support for USYCA, modeling the organization's apparel at a photo shoot on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne, only hours before the Aussies were to take on the English in a One Day International match. In February, American Cricket Champ sets began to arrive at USYCA headquarters in Maryland, and were quickly redistributed to schools across the country. On 14 April 2011, USYCA held its first-ever Annual General Meeting. In June, USYCA donated cricket sets to sixteen Alabama schools that had suffered severe tornado damage two months prior. In July, USYCA announced that 136 elementary and middle schools in the Charlotte- Mecklenburg Schools system in North Carolina were adding cricket to their PE curriculums, and the schools would also be offering students opportunities to play the game in other venues. In December, the USYCA purchased the USYCA Foxfire Field, one of the country's best cricket grounds, for $1 per year and will be the venue for countless youth cricket tournaments and development of youth cricket in the United States. The field is located centrally 20 miles south of Wichita, Kansas, and it had been the vision of USYCA vice-president Edward Fox, who personally funded the construction at a total cost of $120,000. USYCA Acquires Venue For National Youth Cricket Tournaments USYCA. Retrieved 29 December 2011 USYCA announced the opening of its first national headquarters, and a dedicated phone line, in January 2012. The headquarters building is located in Glen Burnie, Maryland, near Baltimore-Washington International Airport. In July 2013, the first state championship was held in Maryland. The match was played between Germantown and Cockeysville, Germantown being the victor. The third place match was played between Bowie and Timonium, Bowie being the victor. Maryland Deputy Secretary of State, Rajan Natarajan, attended the matches, and presented awards following it. In April 2016, USYCA has its third election and Ranjeet Singh from St. Louis, Missouri was elected as the President. In March 2017, a new chapter opened in history of USYCA, when NYCL, the largest youth cricket event in USA became part of USYCA. NYCL in 2017 featured 45 Teams and was held in Connecticut and New Jersey, hosted by New England Youth Cricket Academy, DreamCricket and CricMax. Association With Reebok In March 2012, USYCA announced a three-year sponsorship deal with Reebok Cricket, the first of its kind for an international sports brand in the United States cricket market. Partnership With American Cricket Federation On May 6, 2013, USYCA announced its partnership with the American Cricket Federation. The agreement gives USYCA the lead role in cricket development in age groups up to 13-Under, while ACF will coordinate the transition to older age groups. The partnership anticipated a substantial sharing of resources, communications, facilities and volunteer networks. National Youth Cricket Day USYCA established 24 March as National Youth Cricket Day. This day was selected because it was on that day in 2010 that Venu Palaparthi wrote to Harrison on behalf of DreamCricket.com, making the initial offer of donated cricket sets: \\"We would like to support any initiative in Maryland that involves putting basic cricket kits in the hands of Phy Ed teachers. Our max budget is 10 kits ‚Äì each costing $1000. So let us get this going.\\" (The $1000 figure was a typo; he meant $100.) Logo The USYCA logo, unveiled on 5 May 2010, was designed by Jamie Harrison and produced by his 17-year-old son, Zachary. It reflects the mission of USYCA through its depiction of a young girl bowling and a young boy batting; its color scheme of red, white and blue marks it as clearly American.

The group creates both public art and public artists. It was founded on April 1, 2010 and was established as a California corporation on January 6, 2011, by Rebecca Anders, Jessica Hobbs, Peter (PK) Kimelman, Catherine Magee and Colinne Hemrich. As of 2016 the Board of Directors consists of Kimelman, Hobbs, Magee, Paul Belger and Thwen Chaloemtiarana. It is a \\"public charity\\" 501c(3) non-profit, supported by grants, public donations and the display of its artworks. Its works are notable not only for their scale but interactivity with the audience relying on participation to create atmospheric effects. The group draws upon Situationist and Fluxus ideas of creating spectacle to establish social connections as an effect of the artwork. This \\"community creation\\" is mirrored in the pieces' creation by a large-number of volunteers who themselves create new social networks. The Foundation also provides mentorship and fiscal sponsorship to other large- scale artists. Flux is administratively based in San Francisco, while its studios are located at American Steel Studios in West Oakland, California.  Projects / Artworks * The Temple of Flux is the seminal project of the foundation. The temple was built over the course of four months, the initial stages of its creation took place in the American Steel Warehouse in Oakland, California. The projects construction was completed in August 2010 at Black Rock City, during the Burning Man Festival. After standing for a mere 9 days, the piece was burned at the festival's conclusion in a choreographed performance of flame effects. * Fishbug/Chimera Sententia 2.0 - 2009/2011 (continues to be exhibited) * Spire of Wishes - 2010 (originally shown at the Bentley Reserve in San Francisco, now in a private collection in Sonoma County) * BrollyFlock! - 2011 * The Fluxcycles: Fluxicleta - 2011, Dragon Wagon - 2012, Poppy Wagon - 2014 (continue to be exhibited) * Colony - 2012 (commissioned for the Annual Meeting of the American Association of museums, acquired by the Skirball Center, Los Angeles) * TweetHaus OAK - 2012.

After submitting requested documentation to the IRS and to PayPal the foundation was unable to access the account for four days, there was no clear expectation as to how or when the issue could be resolved. The San Francisco Bay Guardian broke the story, which lit a firestorm of dissent towards the online financial facilitator. The day following the Guardian article PayPal granted the foundation a one time opportunity to withdraw funds from the account. Although PayPal refused to comment, it would appear the offer was made as a result of a backlash of negative media attention, with CNN, Fast Company and other media outlets picking up the story. Exhibitions & Lectures The Foundation has exhibited at several art and music festivals, including Maker Faire, Coachella, Burning Man, the Electric Daisy Carnival, Nocturnal Festival, Beyond Wonderland and others. Principals have spoken on Flux's work at TED, SXSW, the Exploratorium, the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Museums, Maker Faire and several universities.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in County Meath unless stated otherwise.

By 1780 it was known as Rancho Nuevo. In 1899, Vicente Alonso added Rancho Nuevo to his already vast estates. By this time, the Hacienda of Chinameca consisted of 35,000 ha. The house was built by Leon Salinas in 1906 and its territory covered 64,000 ha, the largest hacienda in Morelos. After nine years of fighting, Venustiano Carranza sent 3,000 soldiers to capture Zapata in late 1918. General Pablo Gonzalez, Carranza's man in Cuautla, sent Coronel Jesus Guajardo to do his dirty work. Guajardo offered to negotiate with Zapata and even offered him a horse called \\"As de Oros.\\" On April 10, 1919, Zapata set off on his horse from Piedra Encimada escorted by ten men. Upon entering the Hacienda of Chinameca, Zapata, his assistant Palacios, and two other bodyguards were killed.

Balthasar was the youngest son of Henry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg and Dorothea of Brandenburg, the daughter of the Margrave Frederick I of Brandenburg.

He probably was not satisfied with ecclesiastical life and returned to lay status in 1479. After mediation by his mother, an agreement was reached on 13 January 1480 between him and his older brothers to divide the duchy.

It was the oldest known mosque in the country, prior to the discovery in September 2018 of the ruins of a 1000-year-old mosque dating back to the Islamic Golden Age, near the Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Mosque in the city of Al Ain, Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Still in use, it is located in the small village of Al-Badiyah or Al-Bidiyah, about north of the Emirate's capital city, and is also known as the \\"Ottoman Mosque\\". History The mosque's date of construction is uncertain and because the mud and stone built structure uses no wood, radiocarbon dating is not possible. It is estimated to date to the 15th century, however some much earlier estimates have been proposed. The site was investigated by the archaeological center of Fujairah in co-operation with the University of Sydney from 1997-98. and Fujairah Archaeology and Heritage Department concluded that the mosque was believed to be built in 1446 AD, along with the two watch towers overlooking the mosque and the village. Structure The small, square structure has an area of and was built from materials available in the area, primarily stones of various sizes and mud bricks coated in many layers of whitewashed plaster. The roof has four squats, helical domes that are supported by only one centrally placed pillar that also forms the ceiling. Entrance to the mosque is through double-winged wooden doors. The prayer hall has a small mihrab (the niche in the wall that indicates the direction of Mecca), a simple pulpit, arches, and openings. A central pillar divides the internal space into four squares of similar dimensions. The pillar supports all four domes that can be seen from the exterior. Inside the prayer hall, a number of small decorative windows allow light and air to enter the mosque. There are also cube-shaped spaces carved into the thick walls where copies of the Quran and other books are stored. The mosque continues to host daily prayers, and is a tourist attraction.

It is a violet crystalline, paramagnetic solid. Vanadocene has relatively limited practical use, but it has been extensively studied.  Structure and bonding  V(C5H5)2 is a metallocene, a class of organometallic compounds that typically have a metal ion sandwiched between two cyclopentadienyl rings. In the solid state, the molecule has D5d symmetry. The vanadium(II) center resides equidistant between the center of the two cyclopentadienyl rings at a crystallographic center of inversion. The average V-C bond distance is 226 pm. The Cp rings of vanadocene are dynamically disordered at temperatures above 170 K and are only fully ordered at 108 K.  Preparation  Vanadocene was first prepared in 1954 by Birmingham, Fischer, and Wilkinson via a reduction of vanadocene dichloride with aluminum hydride, after which vanadocene was sublimed in vacuum at 100 ÀöC. A modern synthesis of vanadocene that allows production in higher quantities requires treating [V2Cl3(THF)6]2[Zn2Cl6] with cyclopentadienylsodium.Lorber, C. \\"Vanadium Organometallics.\\" Chapter 5.01.

It is usually produced by the fungus Rhizoctonia leguminicola. It is a common fungal pathogen of red clover (Trifolium pratense) that causes black patch disease in the plant. Slaframine has the molecular formula C10H18N2O2.Smith G. W., (2007). Slaframine. In R.C.Gupta (Eds.), Veterinary Toxicology: Basic & Clinical Principles, Chapter 81, pp. 1011-1013 The different environmental condition promotes the growth of the Rhizoctonia leguminicola fungus. For example, wet and humid weather are the favorable environmental condition for the growth of the fungus and production of slaframine. Legume hays contaminated with slaframine causes slobber syndrome and the various animals are sensitive to its effects.Gaskill C., (2010). Slaframine Toxication. Bluegrass Equine Digest. Retrieved from http://www.ca.uky.edu/gluck/images/BED/BED-July10.pdf on April 12, 2011 History In the late 1940s and 1950s in Midwestern United States, various agricultural experiment stations revealed the outbreaks of salivation in the cattle. In 1956, the first case of fungal contamination of red clover with Rhizoctonia leguminicola was reported which was mainly associated with a pasture disease called black patch. This was so called because it derives its name from the appearance of affected areas in the field. Most of these cases were associated with the feeding of second-cutting red clover hay. Another serious outbreak of slobbers occurred in a herd of horses in the fall of 1979 near High Point, North Carolina. This was caused by a shipment of high-quality second-cutting red clover-orchard grass hay from a usual supplier in West Virginia.Hagler, W.M. & Behlow, R.F. (1981) Salivary Syndrome in Horses: Identification of Slaframine in Red Clover Hay, \\"Applied and Environmental Microbiology\\", 42 (6):1067-1073 In 2010, the slaframine toxin, or \\"slobber toxin\\" was also observed in Central Kentucky because of the wet spring weather and abundant clover growth. Metabolism Liver is the major site of slaframine metabolism where it has been suggested that slaframine is metabolized in the liver by a microsomal flavoprotein oxidase to the ketoimine metabolite consisting of quaternary nitrogen separated from an acetate ester by two carbon atoms (Figure 2). thumbcenter300pxFigure 2: Activation of slaframine in the liver to the putative, biologically active ketoimine metabolite Croom, W.J.

Retrieved from http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_slobbers.htm on April 18, 2011 Signs typically develop within hours of exposure. The Slaframine poisoning or slobbers likely occur in a cooler and wetter spring or fall because these seasons are ideal for the growth of the fungus Rhizoctonia leguminicola. The other clinical signs associated with the \\"slobbers syndrome\\" include salivation, lacrimation, feed refusal, bloating, stiff joints, diarrhea, and weight loss. The clinical signs of slaframine toxicity are similar in all species. When animals are fed with slaframine contaminated forage then they salivate profusely. The experiment shows that a single dose of slaframine produces salivation for 6‚Äì10 hours. However, clinically affected animals can slobber for several days because they are fed with continued slaframine contaminated forages. Various other animals like sheep, swine, and guinea pigs were also found to suffer from Cyanosis and open-mouth breathing under experimental conditions in sheep, swine, and guinea pigs. Pigs were also observed to vomit, became dyspneic, and collapse with stiffened pelvic limbs. Diagnosis and treatment Generally, diagnosis of slaframine toxicity is done by observation of clinical signs (salivation) in animals consuming legume forage, particularly red clover hay. Further tests such as isolating in cultures can be done to identify the fungus Rhizoctonia leguminicola in the hay. Although chemical analysis for slaframine is not usually necessary, chromatographic methods for detecting the toxin in hay, plasma, or milk have been described. Slowly, the slobber symptoms recover when the contaminated hay is removed, however clinical signs may persist for 1‚Äì2 days following removal of the toxic forage. In severe cases, atropine may be of benefit that helps in reversing the parasympathomimetic effects of slaframine, however it is unlikely to be completely resolving clinical signs.

They are one of the longest established theatre companies in North West of England. The name of the Company has changed several times over the years, with the original company being established in 1901. Centenary perform four productions each performance season including musicals and plays. The company also performs concerts in aid of local charities. Centenary Theatre Company is a registered charity in the U.K. Membership to the company is not based on artistic ability. Only if members wish to perform in productions is any audition required. Centenary is also affiliated to the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA). The group performs at The Brindley in Runcorn. History of Centenary The origins of the Company can be traced back to 1901 and the forming of a ladies' choral society, which was augmented by a drama group in 1904. By 1907 the Operatic and Dramatic Society took the form seen today, with the Crosfield family taking a very active part. The Society‚Äôs first full-scale musical was in 1907 with the presentation of Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury.Roy Western, A Brief History of Centenary Earlier choral and dramatic productions were performed in the then newly built Crosfield Assembly Hall, which now forms part of the ground floor of the Crosfield General Office Building. In later years, musical shows were transferred to the Parr Hall, and then on to the Royal Court Theatre, now lost with its site being occupied today by the Warrington Information Offices. Crosfields celebrated their 100 years of soap making (1815‚Äì1915), and marked this several years later by building the Centenary Theatre. The Society‚Äôs first production, in the main body of the hall (the stage had not been built yet!), was The Princess of Kensington. One year later in 1925, came the first full stage production in the theatre, The Geisha Girl. The Company's activities were suspended for World War II, as indeed it had been for World War I. Prior to 1940 the musical productions had consisted primarily of one, two or three main scenes incorporating a large chorus that remained on stage for up to 75% of the time. In the late 1940s a change came about with the arrival of bigger, more glamorous, and ever costlier shows ‚Äì demanding more efficient detail and stage effects. One such show was The Desert Song, performed by the Society in 1947, which proved to be one of the group's greater successes, particularly in terms of attendance figures, playing to full houses ‚Äì including the Saturday afternoon matin√©e. During this period amateur theatre in general was booming and continued to do so for many years. The Company flourished and was able to support various charities with donations amounting to many thousands of pounds. The company has now completed in excess of 130 musical shows since the first one back in those early days of 1907 ‚Äì with two shows every year from 1961 onwards. They also produce two plays each year and these have included a wide variety of plays including classic drama; farce; comedy and ‚Äòwhodunits‚Äô. In 1984 the Society changed its name from 'Crosfields' to 'Centenary Operatic and Dramatic Society' ‚Äì named after the theatre where all productions were then staged. The Centenary Theatre closed in 1991. The last musical there was Cabaret and the last play was Hindle Wakes. Later on that year the group returned to the Parr Hall ‚Äì after decades away ‚Äì with Carousel. In 2005 Centenary moved again to a new purpose built theatre - Runcorn's Brindley Theatre. To coincide with the move to a professional venue, Centenary Operatic and Dramatic Society changed its name to Centenary Theatre Company.

Prior to HTML5, web browsers disallowed cross-site scripting, to protect against security attacks. This practice barred communication between non- hostile pages as well, making document interaction of any kind difficult. Cross-document messaging allows scripts to interact across these boundaries, while providing a rudimentary level of security. Requirements and attributes Using the Messaging API's \`postMessage\` method, plain text messages can be sent from one domain to another, e.g. from a parent document to an IFRAME. This requires that the author first obtain the \`Window\` object of the receiving document. As a result, messages can be posted to the following: * other frames or iframes within the sender document's window * windows the sender document explicitly opens through JavaScript calls * the parent window of the sender document * the window which opened the sender document The message \`event\` being received has the following attributes: * \`data\`  The data, or actual content, of the incoming message. * \`origin\`  The origin of the sender document. This typically includes the scheme, hostname and port. It does not include the path or fragment identifier. * \`source\`  the \`WindowProxy\` of where the document came from (the source window). \`postMessage\` is not a blocking call; messages are processed asynchronously.http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-webmessaging-20101118/#web- messaging Example Consider we want document A loaded from \`example.net\` to communicate with document B loaded from \`example.com\` into an \`iframe\` or popup window. The JavaScript for document A will look as follows: var o = document.getElementsByTagName('iframe')[0]; o.contentWindow.postMessage('Hello B', 'http://example.com/'); The origin of our \`contentWindow\` object is passed to \`postMessage\`. It must match the \`origin\` of the document we wish to communicate with (in this case, document B). Otherwise, a security error will be thrown and the script will stop. The JavaScript for document B will look as follows: function receiver(event) { if (event.origin  'http://example.net') { if (event.data  'Hello B') { event.source.postMessage('Hello A, how are you?', event.origin); } else { alert(event.data); } } } window.addEventListener('message', receiver, false); An event listener is set up to receive messages from document A. Using the \`origin\` property, it then checks that the domain of the sender is the expected domain. Document B then looks at the message, either displaying it to the user, or responding in turn with a message of its own for document A. Security Poor origin checking can pose a risk for applications which employ cross-document messaging. To safeguard against malicious code from foreign domains, authors should check the \`origin\` attribute to ensure messages are accepted from domains they expect to receive messages from. The format of incoming data should also be checked that it matches the expected format.

And Austin Pendleton‚Äôs quirky and amusing production doesn‚Äôt always keep its balance ... But D‚ÄôAmour has penned a very provocative snapshot of the perilous moment ... that sense of dislocation is exquisitely embodied in the work of Laurie Metcalf, an actress who long has understood the precarious dreams of the lower-middle class. Her blistering performance here has the incision of a laser, creating a character who knows that everything is going away and tries to figure out what that might mean.\\" \\"The dream here is the 1960s first-ring suburb,\\" said Michael Brosilow, \\"where neighbors socialize and kids play outside. But in 2010, \\"does anyone talk to their neighbors anymore?\\" Sharon asks, before revealing that she and Kenny are recovering substance abusers. That revelation puts the first chinks in the veneer of Mary and Ben‚Äôs safe-and-happy home life; we come to see how close they are to the precipice.\\" Mary Shen Barnidge of the Windy City Times observed, \\"Despite the serious questions it raises, D'Amour's premise has all the makings of a situation comedy. There's even a drunk scene‚Äîthat standby of 1950s farce‚Äîalong with extended recitations of heavily-symbolic dreams and the bizarre street names characteristic of open-box-add-water subdivisions to escalate the atmosphere of dislocation.\\" The London production received similar responses. Many praised D'Amour's writing and Michael Billington in The Guardian wrote: \\"D'Amour makes some interesting points in this two-hour play: especially about the lingering suburban dream of a post-Thoreau, back-to-nature existence that leads the two women to set out on an abortive camping trip, which is matched by the hard-up guys planning a nocturnal rave-up. But, although D'Amour registers the solitude and despair of the innercity suburbs, she only briefly relates that to the broader picture of American decline and consigns a lecture on the loss of communal values to an awkward coda.\\"Billington, Michael. The Guardian, 16 May 2012 Time Out London gave the London production a four out of five star rating and wrote: \\"'Detroit' looks like a very fine small-scale play that's trying a touch too hard to embrace big national themes. But there's a lovely looseness, rhythm and exhilaration to D'Amour's writing, especially in the tender, misguided relationship between the two women, who take off for a weekend camping in the woods....but only make it as far as the gas station. It is most original when it advances on Betty Friedan in its wry, acute portrait of contemporary suburban women living dangerously, on the tightrope between boredom and self-destruction.\\"\\"Detroit\\" timeout.com (London), May 16, 2012 The Blog, A Cultured Lad gave it a positive review stating that \\"D‚ÄôAmour‚Äôs play is fierce, and ferociously funny.

After the fairness doctrine was repealed in 1987, the personal attack rule persisted until 2000, when it was first suspended and then abolished after an FCC comment period. Mechanics The personal attack rule was invoked whenever \\"an attack is made upon the honesty, character, integrity, or like personal qualities of an identified person or group\\" during broadcast or original cable TV programming while discussing \\"controversial issues of public importance.\\" After such an attack, within a week the broadcast station or cable provider responsible for the programming was required to give the person or group attacked the following: #notification and identification of the cablecast; #a script, tape or accurate summary of the attack; and #an offer of a reasonable opportunity to respond over the cable facilities. Failure to abide by the personal attack rule could have resulted in FCC sanctions or a refusal to renew a broadcaster's license; however, these sanctions did not include a civil action by the party attacked and not given a satisfactory opportunity to respond. Attacks by political candidates and their supporters during mandated airtime; attacks made during newscasts, interviews, and on-the-spot news coverage; and attacks on foreign groups or foreign public figures were excluded from the rule. History The personal attack rule was promulgated by the FCC under the authority of the Communications Act of 1934 and first upheld by the Supreme Court in its 1969 Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC decision. As the Third Circuit in Lechtner v. Brownyard wrote, \\"The personal attack rule is, thus, a special application of 'the general fairness requirement that issues be presented, and presented with coverage of competing views....' Red Lion, supra, 395 U.S. at 378, 89 S.Ct. at 1800. The only variation is that the broadcaster is not given the option of presenting the attacked party's side himself or of choosing a third party to represent that side: the person attacked is afforded the opportunity to rebut.\\" Even after the end of the closely related fairness doctrine, the personal attack rule continued to be enforced until 2000. The rule, however, came to an end after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered an immediate end with its ruling in Radio-Television News Directors Association, where the court chastised the agency for years of inaction in addressing the rule.

She was a popular boat, providing day cruises from Ayr and remaining in service until 1970. History TS Duchess of Hamilton was built by Harland and Wolff at Govan for the Caledonian Steam Packet Company following the success of her sister . Built to replace at Ayr, she was a one-class vessel, carrying saloon class passengers only and had a service speed of around 18 knots. She came under the control of British Railways in 1948, and in 1965 received new livery of a blue hull with red rampant lions on her funnels. Superseded by diesel vessels, she gave her last voyage, to Campbeltown on 28 September 1970. Sold to the Reo- Stakis organisation as a night club/restaurant, she was moved to Ardrossan for modification, but the project failed and she was broken up, at Troon in 1974. Layout Duchess of Hamilton was almost identical to her sister, . Their single class made them spacious, as facilities were not duplicated. She had an \\"Old English\\" bar, a tearoom and two lounges ‚Äì an observation lounge on the promenade deck and below that, a luxurious forward saloon. Aft on the main deck, there was a dining saloon. Crosstrees were added to her mainmast in 1939. The wheel house was originally open but was enclosed in 1948. A cafeteria was installed in 1955 and the following year she was converted from coal to oil burning and was fitted with radar in 1960. Service Duchess of Hamilton operated as an excursion steamer from Ayr, Troon and Ardrossan until 1939. During the Second World War she served as a troop carrier between Stranraer and Larne and she also tendered in the Clyde. After the war, she ran long distance excursions from Gourock to Campbeltown and later to Ayr, Arran and Inveraray as well.

However, the southern section of the ringroad, where it is named South Marketgait, has undergone major reconstruction as part of the city's waterfront redevelopment scheme. Previously, the A991 met the A85 at the Riverside roundabout, beside Dundee Railway Station; and just to the east, the A92 at a grade-separated junction at the northern terminus of the Tay Road Bridge. As of 2015, this has been replaced by a grid scheme of streets, with the east and westbound carriageways of the A991 now separate streets. Major realignment has also taken place of the on- and off-ramps of the Tay Bridge. Travelling west on the A991 from East Dock Street to West Marketgait now requires driving three sides of a rectangle, passing below the northmost span of the Tay Road Bridge. The rest of the A991 is still dual-carriageway. Travelling clockwise from the railway station, the A991 is known as West Marketgait between there and the West Port Roundabout. Past the West Port Roundabout, in the section known as Marketgait, the road goes North to the Dudhope Roundabout, the southeast terminus of the A923, then east to the Ladywell Roundabout after which it goes through a tunnel under the A929 (Victoria Road) and curves southeast to the East Port Roundabout.

Lock was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He was born in East Molesey, Surrey. Playing career Lock made his first-class debut for Surrey in the 1926 County Championship against Glamorgan. He played first-class cricket for Surrey from 1926 to 1932, making 32 infrequent appearances. A tailend batsman, Lock scored 89 runs for Surrey in first-class cricket at a batting average of just 4.23. His position within the team was that of a bowler. He took 75 wickets for Surrey at a bowling average of 31.74, although he never took a five wicket haul, with his best figures being 4/34. His best innings bowling figures came against Leicestershire in 1928. Lock played a handful of first-class matches for other teams besides Surrey. He toured the West Indies with Baron Tennyson's XI in 1927, playing just a single first-class match against Jamaica. He took just a single wicket in the match, that of Charles Morales for the cost of 118 runs. While playing for Surrey, he represented the Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship, which entitled him to represent the Minor Counties cricket team in a first-class match against the touring New Zealanders in 1931. He took 4 New Zealand wickets in their first-innings, those of John Mills, Cyril Allcott, Ken James and Jack Kerr. Lock joined Devon in 1934, making his debut for the county in the Minor Counties Championship against the Kent Second XI. He continued to play Minor counties cricket for Devon until 1939. While playing for Devon, Somerset and Gloucestershire offered him terms, but Lock joined neither. While playing for Devon he played his second and final first- class match for the Minor Counties against Oxford University. While still a player, Lock stood as an umpire in a single first-class match in 1928 between the Army and the Royal Air Force. Groundsman and later life The Oval, which Lock famously prepared in time for the 1946 season following six years of military use Lock's career as a groundsman began in 1922 when he was on the ground staff for the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the Surrey ground staff in the same year, an association which lasted until 1932 when he joined Devon, becoming their head groundsman at the County Ground, Exeter. The war brought a break in his career as a groundsman, as he served in the Royal Air Force. In May 1942 a Luftwaffe bomb hit his home, killing a guest staying there and several neighbours. Demobilised in 1945, he returned to The Oval. During the course of the war The Oval was used by the military. Originally prepared as a prisoner of war camp, instead it was used for anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, searchlights and an Army assault course. As a result the outfield was littered with barbed wire, pits, cement posts and over 900 wooden posts. Lock started repairing the ground in October 1945, in order to get it ready for the start of the 1946 season in April. Lock and his small staff levelled the playing field and laid some 45,000 pieces of turf, working from dawn till dusk. They successfully achieved their aim and the ground was ready for start of the 1946 season. Lock continued as Surrey's head groundsman until 1965, seven years after Surrey had been county champions for seven straight seasons. He had to give up being a groundsman due to an arthritic hip, which required an operation. He was soon after employed as a sports consultant with Berk Chemicals. He later became the Official Inspector of Pitches for the Test and County Cricket Board. Outside of his work as a groundsman, he ran a course at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Lock was intending to go into business as a sports turf consultant, but died in Honor Oak, London, on 19 May 1978.

The headquarters of the Metropolia is located in Zagreb, Croatia and its jurisdiction covers northern Croatia and the entire territory of Slovenia. History During the Middle Ages, Slovenia was under Habsburg rule, while the neighbouring Banate of Slavonia was under the rule of Hungarian kings. Some eastern regions of medieval Slavonia were inhabited by Serbs, who settled there after fleeing Bosnia during the 15th century, even before the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463. In 1438, Pope Eugene IV sent the inquisitor Giacomo della Marca to Slavonia as a missionary to baptize \\"schismatic\\" Serbs in \\"Roman religion\\", and if that failed, to banish them. In 1454, Serbian Orthodox liturgical book, the Vara≈ædin Apostol was written in Upper-Slavonian city of Vara≈ædin, for princess Katarina Brankoviƒá of Serbia, wife of Ulrich II, Count of Celje. In the first half of the 16th century, Slavonia was devastated by frequent wars. Eastern part (Lower Slavonia) was conquered by the Ottomans, while the western part (Upper Slavonia) came under the Habsburg rule. Since the renewal of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá in 1557, the Orthodox Serbs of Lower Slavonia were placed under jurisdiction of the Eparchy of Po≈æega, centered at the Orahovica Monastery. In 1595, Serbian Orthodox metropolitan Vasilije of Po≈æega moved to Upper Slavonia, under Habsburg rule, in order to avoid the Turkish oppression. His successors were headquartered in the Marƒça Monastery. In those areas, Serb migrants served as soldiers of the Vara≈ædin Generalate. During the 17th century, bishops of Marƒça led the difficult fight against Roman Catholic proselytism. In addition to Marƒça Monastery, the other spiritual center of Orthodox Serbs in the area was and still is Lepavina Monastery. Abbot Kondrat of Lepavina was killed in 1716, defending the purity of Orthodox faith. He was killed by those Serbs who had become Catholics. In 1734 the headquarters moved to a monastery at Lepavina and the Diocese was called \\"Eparchy of Lepavina\\". Serbian Orthodox bishop Simeon Filipoviƒá of Lepavina (1734-1743) also had residence in Sjeverin. After his death and several years of administration, Eparchy of Lepavina was abolished and in 1750 its territory came under jurisdiction of Serbian Orthodox bishops of Kostajnica. In 1771, the region came under jurisdiction of Orthodox Bishops of Pakrac, and that remained until 1931. =20th century= Soon after the creation of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1918), all Serbian Orthodox ecclesiastical provinces were merged into united Serbian Orthodox Church in 1920. Since the city of Zagreb was second capital of the Kingdom, initiative was revived for the restoration of old \\"Eparchy of Lepavina\\" under newly proposed name \\"Eparchy of Zagreb\\". After long preparations, the region was detached from the Eparchy of Pakrac in 1931, and new Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Zagreb was created, with its Bishop receiving the honorary title of Metropolitan.Constitution of the Serbian Orthodox Church First Eastern Orthodox Metropolitan of Zagreb was Dositej Vasiƒá, a learned theologian, and man of broad vision and understanding in relations with other nations and religions. In spite of that, after the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia in World War II and creation of Independent State of Croatia (1941) he was arrested and tortured. As a consequence, he died in 1945, exiled from his eparchy.Saint Dositej Vasiƒá of Zagreb After World War II, the Zagreb Metropolitanate and the other Dioceses in the territory of Croatia were administered by auxiliary (vicarian) bishop Arsenije Bradvareviƒá. He was succeeded by Damascus Grdaniƒçki, previously Bishop of Banat, and after his death in 1969, the Metropolitanate was administered by the Bishop of Slavonia, Emilian Marinoviƒá. At the regular session of the Holy Assembly of Serbian Orthodox Church in the 1977, the spiritual guidance of this Metropolitanate is entrusted to vicarian bishop Jovan Pavloviƒá of Lepavina, who was elected for Metropolitan of Zagreb in 1982. Next year, the name of eparchy was expanded into Eparchy of Zagreb and Ljubljana. On the proposal of the Metropolit Jovan, the name of eparchy was expanded once more in 1994 into \\"Metropolitanate of Zagreb-Ljubljana and all Italy\\". Jurisdiction over Serbian Orthodox churches in Italy, that was transferred to the Metropolitanate in 1994, lasted until 2011.Metropolitan Jovan (Pavloviƒá) of Zagreb-Ljubljana reposed in the Lord Metropolit Jovan organized the meeting of Serbian Patriarch Pavle and Cardinal Franjo Kuhariƒá (first in the spring of 1991 in Sremski Karlovci, and the other later in Slavonski Brod). He also organized a meeting of Patriarch Pavle and the Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman. In 2014, bishop Porfirije Periƒá was elected Metropolitan of Zagreb and Ljubljana and enthroned in Zagreb on 13 July by Serbian Patriarch Irinej.SOC (2014): Enthronement of His Grace Bishop Dr. Porfirije of Jegar to the throne of Metropolitans of Zagreb-Ljubljana  Bishops and metropolitans  Orthodox bishops and metropolitans who had jurisdiction over the territory of present- day Metropolitanate of Zagreb and Ljubljana = Bishops of Marƒça = * Maksim Predojeviƒá (1630‚Äî1642) * Gavrilo Predojeviƒá (1642‚Äî1644) * Vasilije Predojeviƒá (1644‚Äî1648) * Sava Stanislaviƒá (1648‚Äî1661) * Gavrilo Mijakiƒá (1661‚Äî1671) Since 1705, under jurisdiction of Orthodox Bishops of Pakrac. = Eparchy of Lepavina = * Simeon Filipoviƒá (1734-1743) * (1743-1750) administration = Bishops of Kostajnica = * Arsenije Teofanoviƒá (1750-1753) * Josif Stojanoviƒá (1754-1771) After 1771, again under jurisdiction of Bishops of Pakrac. = Metropolitans, since 1931 = * Dositej Vasiƒá (1931-1945) * Arsenije Bradvareviƒá (1945-1947), administration * Damaskin Grdaniƒçki (1947-1969) * Emilijan Marinoviƒá (1969-1977), administration * Jovan Pavloviƒá (1977-2014) * Porfirije Periƒá (2014‚Äìpresent)  See also  * Serbs of Croatia * Eastern Orthodoxy in Croatia * List of the Eparchies of the Serbian Orthodox Church References Sources  * Vjerske zajednice u Hrvatskoj, Zagreb: Prometej, 2008.

The term cowboy had only begun to come into wider usage during the 1870s, and in the place and time, Cowboy was synonymous with rustler. Cattle thieves frequently rode across the border into Mexico and stole cattle from Mexican ranches, which they drove back across the border and sold in the United States. Some modern writers consider them to be one of the first and earliest forms of organized crime syndicates in American history.Alexander, Bob (2014). Bad Company and Burnt Powder: Justice and Injustice in the Old Southwest. Frances B. Vick Series. University of North Texas Press. pp. 259‚Äì261. .Robb, Brian J. (2015). A Brief History of Gangsters. Chapter 1: \\"Lawlessness in the Old West\\". Running Press. . The Mexican government lowered tariffs and added forts along the border, and cross-border rustling and smuggling became less attractive. The Cowboys then began to steal cattle and horses from neighboring American ranches, reselling them to unscrupulous butchers. They held up stagecoaches, stole the strongboxes, and strong-armed passengers for their valuables. In some instances, they killed drivers and passengers.  Origins and background  Tombstone in 1881. The town had a population of about 4,000 with 600 dwellings and two church buildings. Tombstone, Arizona, was one of the last frontier towns in the American Old West. Outlaws from all parts of the Western territories felt the pressures of encroaching civilization and the increased presence of lawmen and the courts, backed by growing populations of farmers and citizens desiring law and order. The town had boomed in less than 18 months from about 100 miners living in tents and shacks to more than 7,000 people by , when Virgil, Wyatt, and Morgan Earp arrived in Tombstone. Virgil Earp had been appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County in Prescott and directed to relocate to Tombstone to concentrate on suppressing the Cowboys' illegal activities. He arrived with his brothers Wyatt and Morgan. He appointed Morgan as an undersheriff, and Wyatt looked for business opportunities. When those didn't work out, Wyatt Earp started riding shotgun for Wells, Fargo & Co., guarding their silver bullion shipments. He was appointed as an assistant Pima County sheriff for a period, and Virgil Earp was hired as Tombstone's city marshal in the middle of 1881. = Cowboys as outlaws = The word cowboy did not begin to come into wider usage until the 1870s. The men who drove cattle for a living were usually called cowhands, drovers, or stockmen. While cowhands were still respected in West Texas, in Cochise County the outlaws' crimes and their notoriety grew such that during the 1880s it was an insult to call a legitimate cattleman a \\"Cowboy.\\" Tombstone resident George Parsons wrote in his diary, \\"A cowboy is a rustler at times, and a rustler is a synonym for desperado‚Äîbandit, outlaw, and horse thief.\\" The San Francisco Examiner wrote in an editorial, \\"Cowboys [are] the most reckless class of outlaws in that wild country ... infinitely worse than the ordinary robber.\\" Legal cowmen were usually landowners and generally called herders or ranchers. On September 16, 1881, thirty days before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Tombstone Epitaph wrote about the \\"Cow-boy Nuisance\\" in Arizona: The notoriety and power of the Cowboys spread from coast to coast. Well-known members of the group included Ike, Billy, and Phineas Clanton, Frank and Tom McLaury, Curly Bill Brocius, Billy Claiborne, Johnny Ringo, Frank Stilwell, Pony Diehl, Pete Spence, and Harry Head. Virgil Earp thought that some of the Cowboys had met at Charleston, Arizona, and taken \\"an oath over blood drawn from the arm of Ringo, the leader, that they would kill us.\\" Three Cowboys were killed by lawmen in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881. Others were later accused of trying to kill Virgil Earp and of assassinating Morgan Earp. Wyatt Earp's posse killed four more Cowboys when they ran down those identified as taking part in the attacks on his brothers. Virgil Earp told the Arizona Daily Star on May 30, 1882, that: He estimated that the Cowboys numbered nearly 200, and that during his time in Cochise Territory about 50 had been killed. A modern estimate puts the number of Cowboys at about 300. Business owners vs. the Cowboys Many of the ranchers and Cowboys who lived in the countryside were resentful of the growing power of industrialists from northern states, who increasingly influenced local politics and law in the county. The ranchers largely maintained control of the country around Tombstone, in large part because of the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers. He grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. As officers of the law, the Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity from the Cowboy faction. =Political and regional conflicts= Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan Under the surface were other tensions aggravating the simmering distrust. Most of the Cowboys were Democrats and Confederate sympathizers from southern states, especially Texas. They considered the business owners and the lawmen, especially the Earps, to be Northern Republican carpetbaggers. Traditional, southern-style, \\"small- government\\" agrarianism of the rural bandit Cowboys conflicted with Northern- style \\"big-government\\" oriented towards development. =Economic conflicts= According to Virgil Earp, the Cowboys were \\"saddlers\\", men who lived in the saddle. Their primary occupation was raiding haciendas in Sonora, Mexico, for cattle. They sold the cattle in Tombstone to cooperative butchers. When they couldn't find cattle to steal, they robbed stages and engaged \\"in similar enterprises\\". He said that as soon as they had money to spend, they roared into Tombstone to spend it freely in the saloons, brothels, and \\"faro banks\\". The Cowboys' generous spending habits earned them friends among the businessmen in town, who welcomed them. There the Cowboys freely expressed their opinions publicly, loudly, and with little opposition. When the Cowboys broke the law, the businessmen feared alienating their customers and hesitated to support lawmen when they confronted cattle thieves or stage robbers. Virgil Earp said that a lawman \\"doing his duty must rely almost entirely upon his own conscience for encouragement. The sympathy of the respectable portion of the community may be with him but it is not openly expressed.\\" Known criminal associates Tombstone sheriff and constituents, an illustration from Mexico, California and Arizona; Being a New and Revised Edition of Old Mexico and Her Lost Provinces The lines were not always distinct between the outlaw element and law enforcement. Doc Holliday had a reputation as a killer. He was friends with Bill Leonard, who was implicated in a stagecoach robbery. On , 1881, three Cowboys tried to rob a Kinnear & Company stagecoach carrying US$26,000 in silver bullion (about $ in today's dollars) near Drew's Station, just outside Contention City. It was en route from Tombstone to Benson, Arizona, the nearest rail terminal. The Cowboys were later identified as Bill Leonard, Harry \\"The Kid\\" Head, and Jim Crane, assisted by Luther King. The brothers Frank and Tom McLaury had a ranch outside Tombstone, which they may have used to receive and sell stolen Mexican cattle. When six U.S. Army mules were stolen from Camp Rucker, Wyatt Earp assisted the U.S. Army in a search. They found the animals on the McLaurys' ranch on the Babacomari River. They also found the branding iron used to change the \\"US\\" brand to \\"D8\\". Frank Patterson and other Cowboys promised to return the mules but showed up two days later without the animals and laughed at the lawmen. Pony Diehl was mentioned in the records of the events leading up to and after the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. He was suspected of involvement in numerous robberies and cattle rustling and of involvement in the theft of US Army mules, along with Sherman McMaster. McMaster had been a Texas Ranger in 1878‚Äì79, during which his unit captured and held Curly Bill Brocius as prisoner for five months. He was also accused of stealing U.S. Army mules and a robbing a stage with outlaw Pony Diehl. The Clanton family, led by Newman Haynes Clanton, had a ranch in a valley outside Tombstone that was likely used for selling stolen Mexican beef. He was assisted by his sons Ike, Billy, and Phin Clanton. Old Man Clanton was involved in the robbery, murder, and torture of a number of Mexican smugglers who were ambushed on their way to Tucson in the 1879 Skeleton Canyon Massacre. He was killed on August 13, 1881, by Mexican soldiers in a retaliatory raid along the Mexican border at Guadalupe Canyon. Ike Clanton repeatedly threatened the Earps and Doc Holliday in the days leading up to the shoot-out on at the OK Corral. Unarmed, he ran from the gunfight. Cowboys and the law Frank Stilwell had previously been accused and acquitted of two murders. He was named a deputy county sheriff by Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan in April 1881. He was dismissed four months later for \\"accounting irregularities\\" relating to the collection of taxes. Law enforcement officers who came into conflict with the Cowboys included Fred White, who was killed by Curly Bill Brocius in what was ruled an accidental shooting. Virgil Earp was at times both U.S. Deputy Marshal for the Southeast Arizona Territory and Tombstone City Marshal. Wyatt Earp had been the Pima County deputy sheriff from August to . On June 28, 1881, Virgil was appointed by Tombstone Mayor John Clum as the permanent Tombstone City Marshal and was paid $150.00 per month. He was to enforce all town ordinances, including the city's ban against carrying a deadly weapon. John J. Gosper, Secretary of State for the Arizona Territory and acting governor after John C. Fr√©mont's virtual abandonment of his post, interviewed both Sheriff Behan and Deputy U.S. Marshal (and Town Marshal) Virgil Earp. Gosper interviewed both County Sheriff Behan and City Marshal and Deputy US Marshal Virgil Earp, who blamed each other for failing to bring the Cowboys under control. Gosper expressed his dismay with both lawmen to Washington, D.C., in a report in September 1881: =Weapon ordinance= To counter the ongoing problems with weapons in Tombstone, the biggest city in the county and the county seat, its city council passed an ordinance on April 19, 1881, that prohibited carrying a deadly weapon in town. It required everyone to deposit weapons at a livery or saloon soon after entering town. As City Marshal, Virgil Earp was charged with enforcing this ordinance. The initial version of Ordinance No. 9, in effect in April, 1880 unintentionally allowed individuals to carry deadly weapons in plain sight, only banning concealed weapons. It had little effect and the later version was passed with the intent to prevent carrying a deadly weapons without a permit. The revised version was in effect when Virgil Earp attempted to disarm the cowboys before the Gunfight at the OK Corral. After the gunfight on October 26, 1881, in which three Cowboys died, the Earps and Holliday had to defend themselves against murder charges filed by Ike Clanton. The defendants cited the weapons ordinance during the preliminary hearing held by Justice Wells Spicer. In his ruling exonerating the lawmen of murder, Judge Spicer described Frank McLaury's insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a \\"proposition both monstrous and startling!\\" =Earp and the Cowboys conflict= Virgil Earp had been appointed the Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County on , 1880, before he arrived in Tombstone. Wyatt Earp was appointed assistant sheriff for Pima County from to , 1880. After Town Marshal Fred White was killed on , 1880, Virgil was appointed to replace him, gaining the position permanently on , 1881. He hired his brother Morgan as a deputy town marshal and occasionally called on Wyatt for assistance. The Earps had repeated conflicts with some of the Cowboys, particularly Ike Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury. This tension eventually resulted in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, on , 1881. Frank, Tom, and Billy Clanton were killed during that shootout. Most historians have considered the McLaurys and the Clantons to be outlaw Cowboys. Billy Claiborne fled the Tombstone gunfight and later claimed he was unarmed. Frank McLaury was known as a good shot. Ike Clanton was not well liked because of his drunkenness. His brother Billy was considered level-headed and hard-working. Some townspeople were particularly fond of young Tom McLaury. Billy Clanton and the McLaurys were landowners and commanded some respect in town. The men were so popular that the Nuggett said after the gunfight that the Cowboys' funeral \\"was the largest ever witnessed in Tombstone.\\" = Earps ambushed = At about 11:30 pm on December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed as he walked from the Oriental Saloon to his room. The Sacramento Daily Record-Union reported that \\"he was fired upon with double-barreled shotguns, loaded with buckshot, by three men concealed in an unfinished building diagonally across on Allen street.\\" Virgil was hit in the back and left arm by three loads of buckshot from about . The Crystal Palace Saloon and the Eagle Brewery beyond Virgil were struck by nineteen buckshot; three passed through the window and one about a foot over the heads of some men standing by a faro-table. George Parsons wrote that he heard \\"four shots in quick succession.\\" Critically wounded, Virgil staggered into the hotel. \\"One shot struck him above the groin, coming out near the spine.\\" The humerus bone in his upper arm was longitudinally fractured. The Los Angeles Daily Herald reported that the \\"cow- boys are bent on vengeance for the slaughter of their companeros a few weeks ago.\\" \\"The doctor says there are four chances in five that he will die.\\" TheSacramento Daily Record-Union wrote that \\"Long ago the cowboy gang threatened the lives of Mayor Clum, Judge Spicer, Marshall Williams, agent of Wells, Fargo & Co., Earp and Holliday, and this is an attempt to carry the threats into execution.\\" At 10:50 p.m. on Saturday, March 18, 1882, after returning from a musical at Schieffelin Hall, Morgan Earp was ambushed and killed. He was playing a late round of billiards at the Campbell & Hatch Billiard Parlor against owner Bob Hatch. Dan Tipton, Sherman McMaster, and Wyatt watched, having received threats that same day. The assailant shot Morgan through the upper half of a four-pane windowed door that opened onto a dark alley. Morgan, about from the door, was struck in the right side and the bullet shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and entered the thigh of mining foreman George A. B. Berry. Another bullet lodged in the wall near the ceiling over Wyatt's head. Several men rushed into the alley but found the shooter had fled. After Morgan was shot, his brothers tried to help him stand, but Morgan said \\"Don't, I can't stand it. This is the last game of pool I'll ever play.\\" Morgan died less than an hour after he was shot. =Earp vendetta= Wyatt Earp first sought the Cowboys who ambushed Virgil Earp in Charleston, Cochise County, seen here in 1885. On December 28, Virgil Earp was ambushed on the streets of Tombstone by hidden assailants shooting from the second story of an unfinished building. A doctor removed of bone from his humerus, and he lost the use of his left arm. The main suspects were Ike and Phin Clanton, and Pony Diehl. Wyatt was appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal to replace Virgil; in turn, he deputized Sherman McMaster, \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson, Origen Charles, Smith and Daniel \\"Tip\\" Tipton. On , 1882, Wyatt Earp obtained arrest warrants for Ike and Phin Clanton and Pony Diehl and led his posse after them. The lawmen searched in Charleston but were unsuccessful. Ike's hat had been found at the scene of Virgil's shooting, but on , 1882, seven Cowboys provided him with an alibi, saying that he was in Charleston at the time. Charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. The Cowboys were not prosecuted for the attack, because of insufficient evidence. On Saturday, March 18, 1882, at , Morgan Earp was killed by a shot in the back while playing billiards. Pete Spence, Frederick Bode, Frank Stilwell, \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz, and one other individual were charged as suspects. The judge could not indict them because the primary witness was Spence's wife, giving him protection under the law on spousal privilege. The Cowboys went free. Wyatt, Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, and a posse of deputies including Cowboys \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson and Sherman McMaster guarded Virgil on his way to the train station in Tucson. They found Frank Stilwell lying in wait and killed him. A second person, possibly Ike Clanton, was also seen but escaped. When Pima County issued warrants for the arrest of the Earps in the murder of Frank Stilwell in the Tucson railyards, Sheriff Behan deputized Johnny Ringo, Pete Spence, Johnny Barnes and about 17 other Cowboys to pursue and arrest the Earps. They were unsuccessful. Bat Masterson and Luke Short were faro dealers for Wyatt for a while at the Oriental Saloon, but both left in . Lou Rickabaugh, the owner of the Oriental Saloon, was also from Dodge City. Other known Cowboys included Billy Claiborne, Curly Bill Brocius, Johnny Ringo, Frank Patterson, Milt Hicks, Bill Hicks, Bill Johnson, Ed Lyle, and Johnny Lyle. In , Diehl was running from the law, as a warrant was issued for his arrest relating to a stagecoach robbery. He eventually was arrested for numerous crimes, including cattle rustling and robbery, and was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison at Santa Fe, New Mexico. He escaped in February 1885 but was recaptured after four days. He was returned to prison and not released until March 1887, at which point his name disappeared from public records; by some accounts he died in a gunfight.  Aftermath  With the deaths of several Cowboy leaders and the departure of the Earp family, the dominance of the outlaw Cowboys waned. Arizona Territory Governor Frederick Tritle visited Tombstone on April 3, 1882, and put a posse of 30 men under the command of Deputy U.S. Marshal J.H. Jackson. Because Arizona was still a territory, Congress approved all of its expenditures. Tritle telegraphed President Chester A. Arthur and asked for an appropriation of $150,000 from Congress to pay for the costs of rooting out the unlawful elements. He also asked for the power to suspend local officials for six months. The U.S. Congress was unwilling to allocate the funds needed to form such a group. Unable to create a group of rangers, Tritle instead called for the formation of volunteer militia to pursue hostile groups of Apache. To combat the depredations of the outlaw Cowboys, General William T. Sherman, following a tour of Arizona's eastern and southern counties, recommended suspension of the Posse Comitatus Act to allow the U.S. Army to aid in restoring order. On the basis of the recommendations of Sherman and Tritle, and following consultation with members of the U.S. Senate, President Arthur issued a decree on May 3, 1882, threatening to use military force if the criminal element did not disperse. The use of the U.S. Army to enforce the law was not necessary, as the outlaw Cowboy problem diminished over the next few months.

He was educated at the Middlesbrough High School for boys Serving History .com He joined the Boy Scouts and attained the rank of Eagle Scout. His first job in the newspaper industry began in 1936 as reporter for the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette. During World War II he served in the British Army and was an officer under Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein. World War II In late 1944, Hamilton was a Major and temporary Commanding Officer of the 11th Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry. At that time the battalion was broken up with the soldiers and officers dispersed as reinforcements to other units. Hamilton was transferred to the Duke of Wellington's Regiment 1/7th Battalion, as second in command under Lt Col Wilsey, in November. During December when the battalion was stationed at the bridgehead at Nijmegen he took temporary command of the 1/7th, on 2 December, whilst Wilsey took temporary command of the Brigade for a week.[The History of The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) by JM Brereton and ACS SavoryPage 318, Para 3] On the day he took command the battalion came under attack from German units at Haalderen, in an attempt to retake the bridge. A German officer, 2/Lt Heinich, 5 Coy 16 Parachute Regiment 6 Parachute Division, was captured by members of 'B' company, who were laying trip flares. Hamilton quickly organised a defence, using his Bren Gun Carriers to hold back the Germans. The attack continued for several days during which the battalion received heavy artillery and mortar fire. Large numbers of prisoners were taken from the 5th, 7th and 10th companies of the German 16 Para Regiment. Fighting intensified, taking in house to house action throughout Haalderen, where the German forces took heavy losses in killed and wounded. 'D' company of the Royal Scots Fusiliers moved in to support the 1/7th on 4 December. German artillery fire intensified on the battalion positions. By 7 December the main attack had been repulsed, though artillery, mortar and sniper attacks continued until the battalion was withdrawn to Nijmegen on 22 January. For his actions and leadership Hamilton was awarded a DSO. A few weeks later, in January 1945, Hamilton was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and took command of the 1/7th Battalion, when Lt Col Wilsey became the Brigade Commander.Battalion War Diary Dec 1944National Archives HS/WD/NWE/906/1 Post war In 1959, he became editor of The Sunday Times.

WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X In February 2011 the company announced that it was developing a four-seat design. The C4 was introduced at the AERO Friedrichshafen 2011 show. The company finalized the design features through an on-line survey to determine the features and performance that potential customers were looking for in a new aircraft. A full-sized exterior mock-up was also displayed at AirVenture 2011. The aircraft first flew on 9 April 2015. Development The company applied to start certification for the C4 under European Aviation Safety Agency rules in early 2011 and intends to gain US Federal Aviation Administration FAA certification through EASA certification reciprocity and was initially forecasting FAA approval in early 2013, although this was later delayed. First deliveries were initially forecast for 2013, at a price of 220,000 Euros or US$250,000. Company CEO Matthias Betsch indicated that the key to the aircraft's success will be the price of US$250,000, saying: \\"We'll do everything to make that number. That's the magic number.\\" In writing about the aircraft's price goal, AVweb's Paul Bertorelli wrote: \\"here comes Flight Designs with a certified, four-place cruiser it proposes to sell for around $250,000. Why does it think it can do this with Diamond's DA40‚Äîa comparable proven and competent airplane‚Äîsells for around $350,000? One reason is that it builds airplanes in the Ukraine, where labor rates are lower. But another may be that it hasn't certified a four-place airplane in the current market and is doing what most airplane companies do: underestimating the cost of bringing a new airplane into production. I wish them the best, but I'd rather see a realistic price that builds in the most important thing any new airplane should have: Good value for the customer and profitability for the company building the airplane. It's never in the customer's interest to have the company losing money on every sale.\\" At AirVenture 2011 the company indicated that they had sold 40 delivery positions. By Sun 'n Fun in March 2012 development was continuing, with a focus on selecting avionics. The company remained committed to the US$250,000 price goal and had about 65 orders for the C4. At the 2012 Aero Expo in Germany, Flight Design displayed a fuselage mock-up of the C4. At Sun 'n Fun 2013 the company indicated that they were delaying development of the aircraft to take advantage of the Federal Aviation Administration's review of the FAR 23 type certification standards, which should simplify and reduce the cost of certifying the C4. If the regulatory changes take too long then the company indicated that it may certify the aircraft in the primary aircraft category instead, even though it would preclude some commercial uses, such as air charter. At this time the first flight of a proof of concept prototype was forecast for the summer of 2014 with certification by the end of 2015. At the end of March 2014 first flight was scheduled for June 2014 with certification forecast to be completed by the end of 2015. The target price of US$250,000 was still current as well. Further delays, however, pushed the first flight back to a new forecast date of November 2014. The C4 was actually first flown on 9 April 2015. The initial flight data showed that it met its design performance goals and had benign approach to stall characteristics.Video of first flight, and interview In April 2015 the company announced that production of the type would be in the United States. The company entered receivership in 2016 and the development of the C4 was suspended at that time. The company was purchased in the summer of 2017 by the German company LiftAir. In January 2018, it was announced that the design for be updated to reflect the regulatory and technology changes that had occurred in the intervening eight years since the C4 was conceived and that production would result in up to six aircraft being produced per month in late 2018. Design The aircraft is an all-composite design developed from the two-seat Flight Design CT family. The structure will be a carbon, Aramide and glass sandwich structure. The wing will be a one-piece cantilever design. Cabin access will be through two doors, hinged at the front, plus a baggage compartment door. Seating is individual front seats, with a rear folding bench seat. Design engines will be the Continental IO-360-AF of and maybe the Thielert Centurion 2.0 turbocharged diesel of .

Douglas was responsible for the National Survey of Health & Development that in turn led to other national birth cohort studies, such as the National Child Development Study, the 1970 British Cohort Study and the Millennium Cohort Study. Life Douglas was born in Alperton, Middlesex, in 1914 and was the son of a clergyman. Upon receiving a Demy, Douglas attended Magdalen College, Oxford, to study Natural sciences and Physiology and was eventually awarded a First class honours degree. He also received a college Choral scholarship, which enabled him to continue studying at Magdalen, and he gained the further degree of B.Sc. in Primate Behaviour. His PhD thesis was on the study of primate behaviour and was supervised by Solomon Zuckerman. In 1934 Douglas started his clinical training at the College of St Bartholomew's Hospital and in 1939 gained the usual professional qualifications of MB.BCh. After qualifying, he worked in the anatomy and physiology departments of the University of Oxford. Career Douglas was a pacifist and conscientious objector, so during World War II he served as Scientific Officer in the Ministry of Social Security, conducting research into Animal Behaviour, in a unit that was supervised by Solly Zuckerman. Between 1941 and 1942, Douglas worked as a lecturer in Physiology at Exeter College. For the rest of the war period, Douglas was a Research Officer at the Oxford Extra Mural Unit of the Ministry of Home Security. As part of this war work, Douglas was involved in a Field Survey of Air-Raid Casualties that aimed to understand the mechanisms by which bomb blasts caused injury and death. This provided him with valuable experience of conducting and analysing large surveys. Prior to the war, the falling birth rate in Britain had been a major concern and during the war the idea of a survey was developed by the Population Investigation Committee, an independent group, based at the London School of Economics. The committee appointed the demographer and sociologist, David Glass, to coordinate research and he suggested that Douglas would be a suitable person to conduct the survey. Dr Frank Yates, a statistical advisor to Zuckerman and Dr Richard Schilling, chairman of the Industrial Health Research Board, also supported Douglas's appointment. Douglas like most people at the time, was particularly concerned with inequality, health in society and at home, and family circumstances. So when the job offer presented itself to study Obstetrics in relation to the falling birth rate, Douglas jumped at the opportunity; it would later define his whole life's work. Douglas was appointed to the position of Executive Director of the Maternity Survey of the Joint Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Population Investigation Committee under the aegis of the Royal Commission on Population. Notable members of the committee included vice-chairman, Sir Alan Moncrieff, with Dermod MacCarthy also on the committee. The Maternity Survey was designed to identify all babies born, during one week, March 3‚Äì9, 1946 throughout England, Wales, and Scotland, and aimed to answer five key questions: # What was the availability of maternity services to different social classes in different parts of the country? # What use was made of these services? # How effective were the services in educating mothers, and in reducing mortality among mothers and infants? # What was the extent of need for domestic help during pregnancy and the puerperium? # What was the nature and extent of expenditure on child-birth? The survey was funded by the Nuffield Foundation and the National Birthday Trust Fund. The study was run by Douglas assisted by Griselda Rowntree and the interviews were performed by health visitors about 2 months after the mothers had given birth. Information on the forms collected by the health visitors was transcribed by students and transferred to punched cards by a team of women. The findings provided information about the high costs of having a baby, and showed the need to change the rules governing anaesthesia in labour. It also showed marked differences in infant survival rates depending on what region of Great Britain the mother was from, and the profound effects of social class on the outcomes of pregnancies. The results of the study were published in 1948 in a book, 'Maternity in Great Britain'. In the same year the National Health Service (NHS) was founded and medical care for pregnancy and birth became free. While writing up the data, Douglas and Glass came up with the idea of following up participants as a cohort study, and the National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) came into being.  National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD)  The NSHD has been described as \\"the granddaddy of all cohort studies\\". To create the cohort, Douglas selected 5361 children representative of all social classes from the offspring of the 13,687 mothers who had participated in the original survey. These cohort members are often termed 'Douglas Babies'. Over the years the scope of the survey has expanded to include a wide range of social, physical and health measures. The study is still on-going and participants have been followed up through 24 data collections up to age 68 to 69, with future collections planned.

It is stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. The Wing is the largest and principal unit within 11th Air Force. A composite organization, it provides air supremacy, surveillance, worldwide airlift, and agile combat support forces to project power and reach. As the host unit at Elmendorf, the 3rd Wing also maintains the installation for force staging and throughput operations for worldwide U.S. DOD short-notice deployments, and provides medical care for all forces in Alaska. The wing's 3rd Operations Group is a direct descendant of the 3rd Attack Group, one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the Army before World War II. The Wing performed reconnaissance and interdiction combat missions from Iwakuni Air Base, Japan, at the beginning of the Korean War. During the Vietnam War, the wing moved in November 1965 to Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, a forward operating base, which frequently came under enemy mortar and rocket fire. Missions included close air support, counterinsurgency, forward air control, interdiction, and radar-controlled bombing. Supported numerous ground operations with strike missions against enemy fortifications, supply areas, lines of communication and personnel, in addition to suppressing fire in landing areas. Today, the 3rd Wing trains and equips an Air Expeditionary Force lead wing composed of more than 6,000 Airmen and E-3B, C-17 and F-22A aircraft. Overview The mission of the 3rd Wing is to support and defend U.S. interests in the Asia Pacific region and around the world by providing units who are ready for worldwide air power projection and a base that is capable of meeting United States Pacific Command's theater staging and throughput requirements. The Wing is composed of four groups each with specific functions. The Operations Group controls all flying and airfield operations. The Maintenance Group performs Aircraft and Aircraft support equipment maintenance. The Mission Support Group has a wide range of responsibilities but a few of its functions are Security, Civil Engineering, Communications, Personnel Management, Logistics, Services and Contracting support; while the Medical Group provides medical and dental care. * 3rd Operations Group (Tail Code: AK) : 3rd Operations Support Squadron : 90th Fighter Squadron (F-22A) : 517th Airlift Squadron (C-12, C-17) : 525th Fighter Squadron (F-22A) : 962nd Airborne Air Control Squadron (E-3) * 3rd Maintenance Group * 3rd Mission Support Group * 3rd Medical Group * Wing Staff Agencies History : For additional lineage and history, see 3rd Operations Group The wing was established as 3rd Bombardment Wing, Light on 10 August 1948. Activated on 18 August 1948 at Yokota Air Base, Japan. The 3rd Bombardment Group was assigned to the wing, which received the group's emblem and honors. The wing trained as a bombardment and reconnaissance wing as part of the army of occupation. The 3rd Bomb Wing moved to Johnson Air Base, Japan, on 1 April 1950, where it trained in bombardment and reconnaissance. The training switched to night interdiction in June. On 25 June 1950, the Air Force redesignated the 8th, 13th and 90th as bombardment squadrons (light, night intruder). That same day, North Korea invaded South Korea during the early morning hours. President Harry Truman authorized the US Air Force and Navy to support the rapidly retreating South Koreans. =Korean War= B-26B-50-DL Invaders during the Korean War.

When the Korean War broke out in June 1950, the 3rd Wing participated from the first bombing sortie to the very last during the Korean War. The 8th Bombardment Squadron, staging from Iwakuni Air Base on the west coast of Japan, flew the first Air Force mission of the war on 27 June. The squadron struck North Korean ground forces, destroying several tanks and vehicles. Later that day, the 13th Bombardment Squadron attacked the tank column again. Bad weather prevented further attacks for the next two days. The first Americans to lose their lives during the Korean War, First Lieutenant Remer L. Harding and Staff Sergeant William Goodwin, were assigned to the 13th Bomb Squadron, 3rd Bombardment Wing when they died 28 June 1950 returning from a sortie on the Korean Peninsula. President Truman, on 30 June, authorized the Air Force to strike targets in North Korea and, in another first, the 3rd Bombardment Wing launched 16 B-26 Invaders from the 8th and 13th Bombardment Squadrons against Pyongyang Airfield the same day, destroying 25 North Korean aircraft on the ground and damaging another 20. Sergeant Nyle Mickly scored the first aerial victory over North Korea by shooting down a fighter.Thompson, A 3rd Bombardment Group (Light) B-26 Invader conducts a rocket attack on the rail yard at Iri, South Korea, in early September 1950 as part of deception operations to draw enemy attention away from the planned amphibious landings at Incheon. On 1 July 1950, the 3rd Bombardment Group moved to Iwakuni Air Base, Japan, where it could be closer to its targets. The wing headquarters remained at Yokota until 1 December 1950, when it joined the group. Initially, the 3rd Bombardment Group operated under the operational control of Fifth Air Force. Control reverted to the wing headquarters on 1 December 1950. The group continued to strike targets in North Korea and fly low-level attacks against advancing North Korean columns. By the end of July, the North Koreans had been forced to stay off the roads during daylight hours. The group switched to night missions in August 1950, flying its jet-black B-26s against North Korean convoys and other targets from its base at Iwakuni. On 15 September 1950, General MacArthur conducted his surprise landing at Incheon, with the ensuing Battle of Inchon cutting off the North Koreans in the south and shifting the initiative to the United Nations forces. The 731st Bombardment Squadron (Light, Night Attack), a reserve unit called to active duty, joined the group's three squadron in November 1950 and remained until June 1951. Operations continued into 1951 as the defensive lines stabilized following the entry of the Chinese Communist People's Liberation Army into the conflict in late 1950. The 3rd Bombardment Group, then back under control of the 3rd Bombardment Wing, continued its night interdiction missions against targets in North Korea. The 3rd Bombardment Group physically rejoined its parent wing when both moved to Kunsan Air Base (K-8), South Korea in August 1951. Colonel Nils O. Odman, who had assumed command of the wing in July, had searchlights mounted on B-26s. The new illumination proved highly effective over the flares that had been used. During the first mission, the wing's B-26 crews succeeded in destroying an entire enemy freight train. Captain John S. Walmsley, Jr. was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on 14 September 1951: flying a night mission in a B-26, Capt Walmsley discovered and attacked an enemy supply train, and after exhausting his ammunition, he flew at low altitude to direct other aircraft to the same objective; the train was destroyed but Walmsley's plane crashed in the target area. The 3rd Bombardment Wing continued to serve in Korea for the remainder of the war. In recognition of the wing's distinguished service, the 3rd Bombardment Wing's was granted the privilege of conducting the last bombing mission over North Korea minutes before implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. At 9:31 pm, 27 July 1953, as midnight approached for the cease-fire to take effect, the 8th Bombardment Squadron bombed a troop concentration in North Korea. When the 3rd Bombardment Wing's units completed their war tour in Korea, they had racked up a record that included the first and last bombing missions of the war. The squadrons had flown 33,220 sorties, destroyed 31,026 vehicles, 337 locomotives, 2,920 boxcars, 116 bridges, and 529 buildings, and cut 918 roads and 841 rail lines. =Cold War= B-57C 53-836 by Mount Fuji about 1957 B-57Bs on the flightline at Johnson AB, about 1957 With the war over in Korea, wing returned to the routine of peacetime duty in the Cold War environment. It remained at Kunsan Air Base until October 1954, when it moved to Johnson Air Base, Japan. In late 1955, the 3rd Bombardment Group received its first Martin B-57B Canberra Night Intruder and began to convert from the B-26.Knaack, p. 322 The 3rd Bombardment Group was reduced to one officer and an enlisted man on 13 August 1956, essentially becoming a paper organization. The wing headquarters assumed direct control over the 8th, 13th, and 90th Bombardment Squadrons. Finally, the Air Force inactivated the 3rd Bombardment Group on 25 October 1957, as part of a reorganization plan that created wing deputy commanders for various functional areas and gave wing commanders more direct control over their units. While the group ceased to exist after 36 years of service, its proud heritage, in the form of its emblem and battle honors remained with the 3rd Bombardment Wing. The B-57Bs suffered from engine malfunctions which filled up the cockpit with toxic fumes, which led to a brief grounding. The USAF was not very happy with the B-57B as it was initially produced. It was still deemed to be inadequate to meet the night intruder and close support role for which it had originally been designed. In August 1958, Mainland Chinese forces began bombarding the Nationalist-held island of Quemoy. The 3rd BG stood by in Japan to strike strategic targets in China, North Korea and possibly even the Soviet Union should the crisis escalate out of control. Fortunately, the crisis soon cooled and hostilities were averted.Mikesh However, the USAF began to re-equip its B-57 wings with the supersonic F-100 Super Sabre tactical fighter-bomber. As the active duty USAF TAC bomb groups were re-equipped, their aircraft were transferred to the Air National Guard (ANG). By 1959 the 3rd Bomb Wing was the last unit equipped with the B-57A, its primary mission being a SIOP (Single Integrated Operations Plan) to perform \\"Quick Strikes\\" against strategic targets on the mainland of Communist China, North Korea and the Eastern Soviet Union. As nuclear weapons could not be stored in Japan, the B-57s were forward deployed to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea, where they stood nuclear alert. With nuclear-armed B-57Bs ready to be launched against pre-programmed targets within fifteen minutes, alerts lasted 30 days at a time, but soon changed to a two-week rotation schedule from Yokota Air Base as each of the three squadrons of the 3rd took their turn rotating crews. In 1961, Air Defense Command sent F-102 Delta Daggers to the 3rd, where the 40th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron flew air defense missions over Japan for a six-month TDY. In late 1963, the 3rd Bomb Wing prepared to stand down in Japan as the USAF wanted to reduce the number of wings in Japan. Although the Wing would be inactivated, two of the B-57 squadrons, the 8th and the 13th were transferred to the direct control of the 41st Air Division and later to the 2nd Air Division at Yokota where they continued the South Korean nuclear alert mission as the USAF mulled over the fate of the B-57B. However, the increasing demands for aircraft in South Vietnam for use in the escalating conflict with North Vietnam caused the Air force to reconsider the inactivation. The aircraft to be moved to Clark AB, Philippines under Thirteenth Air Force. In January 1964 the wing was re designated as the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing, and was reassigned without personnel or equipment to England Air Force Base, Louisiana under Tactical Air Command The 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing kept the 90th Bombardment Squadron, now redesignated as a tactical fighter squadron, and gained the 416th, 510th and 531st Tactical Fighter Squadrons. While at England, the wing was brought up to full strength and transitioned into flying primarily North American F-100D/F Super Sabres. =Vietnam War= North American F-100D-50-NH Super Sabre 55-2881 of the 3rd TFW 531st TFS at Bien Hoa AB A-37A Dragonfly 67-14515 Bien Hoa AB 1968 The wing began deploying its units to South Vietnam on rotational duty while the others trained in their ground support role. In November 1965, the wing moved to Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam as part of the major buildup of forces following President Johnson's decision to commit ground troops. In the years ahead, the wing found itself involved in a variety of duties throughout South Vietnam. Its mission included close air support, counterinsurgency, forward air control, interdiction and radar-controlled bombing. The wing supported numerous ground operations with air strike missions against enemy fortifications, supply areas, lines of communications and personnel, in addition to providing suppressive fire during assault operations. While assigned to Bien Hoa, the wing gained control of various units with different missions. It also supported the testing of the Northrop F-5A Freedom Fighter being developed for other nations under the Skoshi Tiger project. The wing successfully flew the F-5 in combat from April 1966 to April 1967, before turning the fighters over to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. The Wing also evaluated the combat capabilities of the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly during November and December 1967. The attack version of the USAF's primary trainer proved highly adaptable in its ground support role. The 604th Air Commando Squadron, attached to the Wing, flew the Dragonfly from November 1967 to September 1970. In late 1969 the F-100s of the 3rd TFW began a phaseout at Bien Hoa. The 510th TFS was inactivated on 15 November 1969, the 531st TFS on 31 July 1970. The wing converted to the A-37 in 1969. The 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron reverted to its pre-World War II designation of an attack squadron. The 8th Bombardment Squadron was reactivated as the 8th Attack Squadron. During May and June 1970, the wing participated in the Cambodian Campaign aimed at depriving the enemy the use of its sanctuary bases and destroying its leadership. The campaign marked the wing's last major operation. On 31 October 1970, the wing ended its duties in South Vietnam. Unmanned and unequipped, the wing remained active in a \\"paper\\" status until it moved to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea on 15 March 1971. The wing had served for 59 consecutive months of combat duty in Vietnam. It had withstood mortar and rocket attacks and in return had inflicted over 23,000 battle deaths on the enemy. After a 20-year absence, the wing returned to Kunsan Air Base where it was equipped with the McDonnell F-4D Phantom II. Squadrons assigned included the 35th, 36th and 80th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. The wing helped provide air defense for South Korea and maintained proficiency for combat operations. During this period, the wing received a short notice requirement to deploy 18 F-4Ds from the 35th Tactical Fighter Squadron in early April 1972 in support of Operation Linebacker. The air campaign was designed to stop the North Vietnamese 1972 Easter Offensive, launched on 30 March to conquer South Vietnam. The squadron deployed with a full complement of aircrews and maintenance personnel. During its stay in South Vietnam, nine members of the squadron received credit for destroying six North Vietnamese fighters, four MiG-21s and two MiG-19s. =Clark Air Base= thumbMcDonnell Douglas F-4G Phantom Serial 69-0275 of the 90th TFS/3rd TFW Clark AB, Philippines, 1979Later, this aircraft was converted to the F-4G configuration. To AMARC as FP1024 25 March 1996. To Holloman AFB as QF-4G AF151. Expended 2/5/1998. On 16 September 1974, the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing moved without personnel and equipment from Kunsan Air Base, South Korea to Clark Air Base, Philippines. It replaced the inactivated 405th Tactical Fighter Wing. Assigned squadrons included the 26th, 68th and 90th Tactical Fighter Squadrons. The 90th Fighter Squadron flew the F-4D Phantom II. The other two squadrons did not have assigned aircraft at the time. The wing's mission required it to organize and train for combat. It also helped provide air defense for the Philippines. The wing's first big challenge at Clark Air Base, surprisingly did not involve its wartime skills. With the pending fall of South Vietnam, President Gerald Ford announced that the United States would support the evacuation of approximately 2,000 orphans from South Vietnam. The 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing began preparing for the evacuation on 3 April 1975, by converting the base gym into a temporary orphan care center. The first aircraft began arriving at Clark on 5 April. In addition to the expected orphans, the wing discovered that a larger number of adults were also fleeing South Vietnam. When the humanitarian operation ended on 31 May, 1,500 orphans had passed through Clark to the United States in what was termed Operation Baby Lift. New Life, the evacuation of adults to the United States and elsewhere, accounted for 8,786 evacuees supported by the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing. Northrop F-5E Tiger IIs of the 26th Training Aggressor Squadron at Clark ABSerial 73-847 in foreground was originally scheduled for shipment to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, however the aircraft was retained by the USAF after the collapse of the South Vietnamese government in 1975. With the inactivation of the 26th TAS in 1988, this aircraft was sold to the Honduras Air Force. The wing grew in strength during 1975. The 26th Tactical Fighter Squadron received the Northrop T-38 Talon for use as dissimilar air combat training and was re designated the 26th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron. The 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron converted to the F-4E. The 3rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, equipped with the F-4E joined the wing in December, replacing the 68th Tactical Fighter Squadron, which had been inactivated earlier. The wing now possessed a full complement of fighters. On 15 May 1976, the wing gained the 3rd Tactical Electronic Warfare Training Squadron and began operating the Crow Valley Bombing and Gunnery Range. In July the Pacific Air Forces initiated its Cope Thunder training exercises, for which the wing became responsible. It October 1977, the 26th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron switched from the T-38 to the Northrop F-5E Tiger II, which served as an aggressor aircraft. The wing switched to an air superiority mission in January 1978, and on 30 July 1977, the 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron began equipping with the F-4G. A modification of the F-4E, the Advanced Wild Weasel aircraft performed a ground radar suppression and destruction mission. With the addition of the F-4G, the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing acquired the triple role capabilities of air sovereignty, air-to-ground and defense suppression/electronic countermeasures. The wing also provided fighter aggressor training with the F-5E. Versatile and capable, the wing deployed its units throughout the Pacific and supported the training requirements of others. The wing also operated Bell UH-1N helicopters in range support. In 1989, the Philippine government had expressed the desire that the Americans withdraw its forces from the islands. Ten years prior, the 1947 Military Bases Agreement between the two nations had been amended to provide Philippine sovereignty over the bases. The general instability in the Philippines kept the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing in place during Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The Wing, however, deployed six F-4Es to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey for Operation Desert Storm in early 1991, flying an 18,600-mile deployment. There they joined the 7440th Composite Wing (Provisional). They were mission ready within 36 hours and they flew some of that aircraft's last combat sorties. The wing remained at Clark, though treaty negotiations with the Philippines broke down, and it was decided to move the 3rd Wing beginning in 1992‚Äì93. The Mount Pinatubo eruption in June 1991 changed these plans and forced the wing's hasty relocation without personnel or equipment to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska on 19 December 1991, where it replaced the 21st Wing which previously was the host organization for Elemendorf. =Elmendorf Air Force Base= The 19th Fighter Squadron's F-15 Eagle flagship takes off for the final time at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, 13 May 2010 F-22 Raptors of the 3rd Wing With the reassignment, to Alaska, the wing was also redesignated as the 3rd Wing and was realigned to the multi-mission objective wing concept. On assignment to Elmendorf, the 3rd Wing gained the 43rd and 54th Fighter Squadrons and reunited with the 90th Fighter Squadron. The 90th Fighter Squadron, on arrival on Elmendorf, had been equipped with the McDonnell-Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle. It provided the only Air Force long- range interdiction capability in the Pacific Theater. The other two squadrons were equipped with the F-15C Eagle, and provided an air superiority not only Alaska but also for other worldwide locations. The 3rd Wing further gained in capability with the assignment of the Lockheed C-130H Hercules equipped 517th Airlift Squadron on April 1992 and the 962nd Airborne Air Control Squadron and its two Boeing E-3B Sentry aircraft on 1 October 1992. The 3rd Wing provided a composite force that could be rapidly deployed worldwide, which it quickly began to prove. The wing also participated in the Cope Thunder exercise series, which had been moved from Clark Air Base to Eielson Air Force Base in the early 1990s. On 1 January 1994, the 43rd Tactical Fighter Squadron was inactivated and the 19th Tactical Fighter Squadron activated, inheriting the personnel and equipment of the former. In an action symbolizing the transition from the Cold War to a broader worldwide responsibility, the 3rd Wing, on 29 April 1994, ended the last 24-hour air defense alert requirement at King Salmon Airport. The forward operating bases at King Salmon and Galena reverted to contractor operations and were placed in a standby mode. The wing's mission shifted to providing trained and equipped forces for deployment throughout the Pacific Region, as reflected by the motto at the front gate \\"Top Cover and Global Engagement.\\" By 1995, the 3rd Wing's fighter capability had gained recognition throughout the Air Force. The 54th Fighter Squadron made the first operational deployment outside of Alaska when it deployed eight F-15Cs and 90 plus personnel to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey in support of Operation Provide Comfort. They departed on 8 April and returned on 17 July 1995. Only six months later the 90th Fighter Squadron deployed 8 F-15Es and 190 personnel to Aviano Air Base, Italy, in support of Operation Deny Flight/Joint Endeavor. Other deployments continued on an almost routine basis, involving not only the fighter squadrons but 517th Airlift Squadron and the 962nd Airborne Air Control Squadron. In early 1999, the Air Force recognized the 3rd Wing as the number three of ten lead Air Expeditionary Wings with a commitment of deploy. The 3rd Wing also engaged in an exchange program with the Russian Air Force. The wing hosted a visit of 40 Russian air defense personnel and 4 SU-27s in 1995, and in turn visited Russia the next year with four F-15s. Today, the 3rd Wing continues to grow in size and importance because of its strategic location and training facilities. It deploys and employs assigned aircraft worldwide to accomplish air superiority, air interdiction, tactical airlift, airborne air surveillance, theater resupply, passenger service and served as host unit for all Elmemdorf organizations. During 2004, fulfilled Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) taskings in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.

He is known for his work isolating and characterizing seed proteins, and for determining protein nutritional requirements. His career was spent at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Thomas was the son of lawyer Arthur Dimon Osborne and the grandson of US Representative Thomas Burr Osborne. His life exhibited \\"a single purpose, the understanding of the relationships of proteins to each other and the animal world. He began his researches upon vegetable proteins in 1888,...\\" He published his findings in The Vegetable Proteins in 1909. Osborne wrote over 100 papers with longtime collaborator Lafayette Mendel. Both were appointees of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. In their early work, they studied the deadly poison ricin which is classified as a type 2 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) from castor beans. In 1909, Osborne and Mendel's work found what amino acids are necessary for the survival of the laboratory rat. At the Connecticut experimental station they developed a lab with about 200 rats whose dietary intake was carefully controlled.Edna Louise Ferry (1919) \\"Nutrition experiments with rats: a description of methods and technique\\", Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine 8: 735 to 45 Their carefully controlled studies on rats revealed the necessary elements in a healthy diet. The program was described by J.R. Lindsey and H.J. Baker:J. Russell Lindsey & Henry J. Baker, Chapter one: Historical Foundations of The Laboratory Rat by Mark A. Suckow, Steven H. Weisbroth, and Craig L. Franklin (2005) :The striking differences in amino acid composition of plant proteins, which had been documented by Osborne, suggested that possible differences might exist in their biological value. The nutritive values of various purified proteins from cereal grains and other plant sources were compared for growth and maintenance in rats. This led to supplementation of \\"incomplete proteins\\" with those amino acids limiting each foodstuff‚Äôs \\"biological quality\\" (e.g. Tryptophan and lysine). Casein was found to be a \\"complete protein\\", thus paving the way for the use of this protein in modern rat diets. Within a few years it was possible to list the \\"essential\\" and \\"nonessential\\" amino acids. The science of nutrition thus evolved beyond the caloric energy of food, turning to the structural issue of essential amino acids. ;Vitamin A discovery Osborne and Mendel discovered Vitamin A in 1913 in butter fat - independently discovered by Elmer McCollum and Marguerite Davis, who submitted their publication first, with both papers appearing in the same issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry - as well as water-soluble vitamin B in milk. Osborne and Mendel showed, for example, that a lack of Vitamin A in the diet led to xerophthalmia. They also established the importance of lysine and tryptophan in a healthy diet.\\"Lafayette Benedict Mendel.\\"Dictionary of American Biography, Supplements 1-2: To 1940.

It is an aglycone of vicine. A common derivative is the diacetate form (2,6-diamino-1,6-dihydro-4,5-pyrimidinedione). Occurrence Divicine is found in fava beans and in the legume Lathyrus sativus, also known as khesari, which is a cheap and robust food source commonly grown in Asia and East Africa. Synthesis In plants, reduced divicine is formed from the hydrolysis of the inactive Œ≤‚Äìglucoside, vicine. A simplified three-step process for artificial divicine synthesis: # The benzyl group of 2-amino-5-benzyloxy-4-hydroxypyrimidine is removed by acid hydrolysis, yielding 2-amino-4,5-dihydroxypyrimidine. # This intermediate is then treated with nitrous acid to yield the slightly soluble orange product 2-amino-6-nitrosopyrimidine-4,5-diol # Which is then reduced with sodium dithionite to yield divicine.  Reactions  Some chemical characteristics of divicine have been examined. It is known that it vigorously reduces alkaline solutions of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, phosphomolybdate or phosphotungstate and produces an intense blue colour when reacting with an ammoniacal ferric chloride solution, which is used for the identification and proof of the presence of an enolic hydroxyl group. Divicine is very unstable if oxygen is present and the oxidation is most rapid at alkaline pH levels. The half-live of divicine, at room temperature and neutral pH, is around half an hour. Both compounds are almost immediately destroyed by boiling, and breakdown in regular conditions can be accelerated by the presence of heavy metal ions, especially Cu2+. Toxicity Divicine has been deemed a hemotoxic component of fava beans and plays a role in the development of favism, a disorder that involves a hemolytic response to the consumption of broad beans due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD or G6PDH) deficiency. This deficiency, an X-linked recessive hereditary disease, is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide. It is particularly common in those of African, Asian, Mediterranean, and Middle-Eastern descent. Symptoms of favism include hemolysis, prolonged jaundice, kernicterus, and even acute renal failure in extreme cases. Divicine reacts with oxygen in red blood cells, which creates reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion. These molecules are strong oxidizers of NADPH and glutathione. G6PD deficient individuals cannot regenerate NADPH quickly enough to prevent depletion of glutathione. This depletion results in the cells having no protection against oxidative stress caused by the aglycones. Oxidative stress leads to damage of haemoglobin and disulphide bond aggregates (Heinz bodies), which result in haemolytic anaemia, called favism. Divicine is also present in and at least partially responsible for the poisonous action of Lathyrus sativus - a legume commonly grown in drought- and famine-prone regions of Asia and East Africa as an ‚Äòinsurance crop‚Äô for human consumption and livestock feed when other crops fail to grow, despite their known health hazards.http://www.biology- online.org/dictionary/Divicine  Effects on animals  In vitro studies in rats showed that a hemotoxic dose of divicine of 1.5 mM, when added to a suspension of red blood cells, resulted in a rapid decline in cellular glutathione, formation of echinocytes and damage to the membrane skeleton. This resulted in a decrease in haematocrit.

Painted during C√©zanne's final period in the early 1890s, there are five paintings in the series. The versions vary in size, the number of players, and the setting in which the game takes place. C√©zanne also completed numerous drawings and studies in preparation for The Card Players series. One version of The Card Players was sold in 2011 to the Royal Family of Qatar for a price estimated at $250 million ($ million today), signifying a new mark for highest ever price for a painting, not surpassed until November 2017. Overview The series is considered by critics to be a cornerstone of C√©zanne's art during the early-to-mid 1890s period, as well as a \\"prelude\\" to his final years, when he painted some of his most acclaimed work. Each painting depicts Proven√ßal peasants immersed in their pipes and playing cards. The subjects, all male, are displayed as studious within their card playing, eyes cast downward, intent on the game at hand. C√©zanne adapted a motif from 17th-century Dutch and French genre painting which often depicted card games with rowdy, drunken gamblers in taverns, replacing them instead with stone- faced tradesmen in a more simplified setting. Whereas previous paintings of the genre had illustrated heightened moments of drama, C√©zanne's portraits have been noted for their lack of drama, narrative, and conventional characterization. Other than an unused wine bottle in the two-player versions, there is an absence of drink and money, which were prominent fixtures of the 17th-century genre. A painting by one of the Le Nain brothers, hung in an Aix- en-Provence museum near the artist's home, depicts card players and is widely cited as an inspiration for the works by C√©zanne. The models for the paintings were local farmhands, some of whom worked on the C√©zanne family estate, the Jas de Bouffan. Each scene is depicted as one of quiet, still concentration; the men look down at their cards rather than at each other, with the cards being perhaps their sole means of communication outside of work. One critic described the scenes as \\"human still life\\", while another speculated that the men's intense focus on their game mirrors that of the painter's absorption in his art. Paintings While there are, in total, five paintings of card players by C√©zanne, the final three works were similar in composition and number of players (two), causing them to sometimes be grouped together as one version. The exact dates of the paintings are uncertain, but it is long believed C√©zanne began with larger canvases and pared down in size with successive versions, though research in recent years has cast doubt on this assumption. The Card Players, 1890‚Äì1892, Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The largest version, painted between the years 1890‚Äì1892, is the most complex, with five figures on a 134.6 x 180.3 cm (53 √ó 71 in) canvas. It features three card players at the forefront, seated in a semi-circle at a table, with two spectators behind. On the right side of the painting, seated behind the second man and to the right of the third, is a boy, eyes cast downward, also a fixed spectator of the game. Further back, on the left side between the first and second player is a man standing, back to the wall, smoking a pipe and presumably awaiting his turn at the table. It has been speculated C√©zanne added the standing man to provide depth to the painting, as well as to draw the eye to the upper portion of the canvas. As with the other versions, it displays a suppressed storytelling of peasant men in loose- fitting garments with natural poses focused entirely on their game. Writer Nicholas Wadley described a \\"tension in opposites\\", in which elements such as shifts of color, light and shadow, shape of hat, and crease of cloth create a story of confrontation through opposition. Others have described an \\"alienation\\" displayed in the series to be most pronounced in this version. The painting is owned and displayed by the Barnes Foundation museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Card Players, 1890‚Äì1892, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York A more condensed version of this painting with four figures, long thought to be the second version of The Card Players, is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. At 65.4 x 81.9 cm (25 3/4 x 32 1/4 in), it is less than half the size of the Barnes painting. Here the composition remains virtually the same, minus the boy, with viewers' perspective slightly closer to the game, but with less space between the figures. In the previous painting, the center player as well as the boy were hatless, whereas this version has all the men hatted. Also gone are the shelf to the left with vase and lower half of a picture frame in the center of the wall, leaving only the four pipes and hanging cloth to join the smoking man behind the card players. The painting is brighter, with less focus on blue tones, than the larger version. X-ray and infrared studies of this version of The Card Players have shown layers of \\"speculative\\" graphite underdrawing, as well as heavy layers of worked oil paint, possibly suggesting it was the preliminary of C√©zanne's two largest versions of the series, rather than the second version as historically believed. The underdrawing has also led analysts to believe C√©zanne had difficulty transferring the men, previously painted individually in studies, onto one canvas. It has been speculated that C√©zanne solved this \\"spatial conundrum\\" in the final three versions of The Card Players, by eliminating spectators and other \\"unnecessary detail\\" while displaying only the \\"absolute essentials\\": two players immersed in their game. The scene has been described as balanced but asymmetrical, as well as naturally symmetrical with the two players being each other's \\"partner in an agreed opposition\\". The man on the left is smoking a pipe, wearing a tophat with a downcast brim, in darker, more formal clothing, seated upright; the man to the right is pipeless, in a shorter hat with upcast brim, lighter, more loosely fit clothing, and hunched over the table. Even cards themselves are contrasting light and dark hues. In each of the two-player paintings, a sole wine bottle rests in the mid-part of the table, said to represent a dividing line between the two participants as well as the center of the painting's \\"symmetrical balance\\". Of the three versions, perhaps the best known and most often reproduced is in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. It is also the smallest at 47.5 x 57 cm (17 3/4 x 22 1/2 in). The Orsay painting was described by art historian Meyer Schapiro as \\"the most monumental and also the most refined\\" of the versions, with the shapes being simpler but more varied in their relationships. It is the most sparsely painted, and generally considered the last of the Card Players series. There is a shift of axis to the scene, in which the player to the left is more completely in the picture, chair included, with the appearance of being nearer to us. His partner to the right is cut off from the scene at his back, and the table is displayed at an angle to the plane. Critics have described a \\"deception of restraint\\" in C√©zanne's use of color; graduated area of thinly applied, \\"priming\\" color used for solid forms and their appearance of structure is met with lilac and green used to \\"liven\\" the canvas, as well as the bright, deep color used on the lower half for the tablecloth. This version of the series was also part of a high-profile theft of eight C√©zanne paintings from a traveling show at Aix in August 1961. The most valuable of the stolen works, The Card Players, was released as a four-color postage stamp by the French government in recognition of the loss. All of the paintings were recovered after a paid ransom several months later. The other two-player paintings are in the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and in a private collection. In February 2012, Vanity Fair reported that the royal family of Qatar had, during 2011, purchased their version of the painting for a record price variously estimated at between $250 million and $320 million from the private collection of Greek shipping magnate George Embiricos.

While it had long been believed he began the series with the largest paintings and subsequently worked smaller, 21st-century x-rays of the paintings as well as further analysis of preparatory sketches and studies has led some scholars to believe C√©zanne used both the studies and the smaller versions of The Card Players to prepare for the larger canvases. Over a dozen initial sketches and painted studies of local farmworkers were made by C√©zanne in preparation for the final paintings. It has been speculated his models sat for the studies rather than the finished works themselves, and the painter possibly sketched preliminary work in an Aix cafe. Some of the studies have been well regarded as stand-alone works of their own volition, particularly the accompaniment piece Man with a Pipe, displayed alongside The Card Players at the Courtauld Gallery in London. The former, along with two similar paintings of smokers undertaken in the same period, are considered by many to be some of C√©zanne's most masterful portraits.

The exhibition ran in London from 21 October 2010 to 16 January 2011 and in New York from 9 February 2011 to 8 May 2011. It was described as the first exhibition devoted to the series as well as the largest collection of C√©zanne's Card Players paintings to ever be exhibited together. The exhibition included the paintings owned by the Courtauld, Metropolitan, and Mus√©e d'Orsay. The versions at the Barnes Foundation and in a private collection were displayed as prints, due to the Barnes' policy of not lending and the private collector declining to release the work. The mini-series of men smoking pipes sometimes referred to as The Smokers was also included with over a dozen other studies and sketches, however a legal dispute also prevented the Hermitage Museum's version of Man with a Pipe from traveling to New York.

The church was consecrated in 1627 and raised to the status of a minor basilica in 1922. It is reputedly the most frequently visited shrine of pilgrimage in Belgium. While the cult on the Scherpenheuvel (or Sharp Hill) is older, its present architectural layout and its enduring importance are due to the patronage of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella and the Counter-Reformation. Origins For many years the Marian cult on the Scherpenheuvel centered on a small statue of the Virgin Mary that hung in an oak tree on top of the hill. According to the foundation legend a shepherd noticed that the image had fallen to the ground and decided to take it home. When he had lifted it, he discovered he was unable to move. As the herd did not return in the evening, his master got worried and went to look for the shepherd. Only by restoring the statue to its original place in the oak tree could the master release the shepherd, thereby discovering the spiritual importance of the site.Pallemaerts (1934). The veracity of this story is impossible to ascertain. It is however clear that the inhabitants of the nearby town of Zichem would frequent the site in the second half of the sixteenth century whenever a member of the family suffered from illness. They would traditionally walk round the tree three times while praying. Zichem was part of the barony of Diest, a possession of the House of Orange-Nassau. In the course of the Dutch Revolt the barony changed hands several times. While occupied by forces of the United Provinces between 1580 and 1583, the statue was removed in an act of iconoclasm. After the town was retaken by Alexander Farnese, the parishioners of Zichem restored the cult in 1587. It was later claimed that they did so after discovering the original statue and returning it to the tree. From then on the cult of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel began to expand. Soldiers and almoners of the Army of Flanders that were stationed in nearby Diest or Zichem helped to spread its reputation.Duerloo and Wingens (2002) pp. 23-28. Development of the shrine After an official enquiry, Mathias Hovius, Archbishop of Mechelen, approved the cult of Scherpenheuvel in 1604.Boni (1953). The approval was accompanied by the publication of a collection of miracles ascribed to the intercession of the Virgin of Scherpenheuvel in Dutch, French and Spanish. An English translation followed in 1606. Philip Numan, who had authored the collection, produced two more editions (1605 and 1606) as well as three more collections (1613-1614, 1617 and 1617-1618) in short succession. Latin versions were published by the famous humanists Justus Lipsius (1605) and Erycius Puteanus (1622). Lesser authors would produce continuations up to 1706. According to these publications, close to 700 miracles were credited to the intercession of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel in the course of the seventeenth century. The Latin collections in particular caused a lot of controversy among theologians, with Calvinist authors ridiculing the whole idea of miraculous intercession by saints.Duerloo and Wingens (2002)pp. 37-39. Meanwhile, it had been decided in 1602 to remove the statue from the oak tree and house it in a small wooden chapel nearby. Within the year the chapel proved too small and was replaced by a modest stone edifice. Its foundation stone was laid on 13 July 1603 by Count Frederik van den Bergh on behalf of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella.Lantin, A. (1971). From that point on the Archdukes showed great interest in the development of the shrine. Attributing the recent relief of the besieged town of 's-Hertogenbosch to the intercession of the Virgin, Albert and Isabella made their first pilgrimage to Scherpenheuvel on 20 November 1603. It would soon become a yearly pilgrimage that took place in May or June and lasted the nine days of a novena. Under the patronage of the Archdukes, the emerging shrine was raised to the status of a town in 1605 and of an independent parish in 1610. Their support helped to ensure the grant of a papal indulgence on 16 September 1606, the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows. In the previous summer the stone chapel was surrounded by a closed garden or Hortus Conclusus in the shape of a heptagon. Shortly after reaching a cease-fire with the United Provinces, Albert and Isabella announced on 28 April 1607 that they would build a vast church and surround it with a planned and fortified town. The foundation stone of the third and present church was laid by them in person on 2 July 1609, the feast of the Visitation.Duerloo and Wingens (2002) pp. 84-95. With the bell tower left unfinished, the church was dedicated by Archbishop Jacobus Boonen in June 1627. In order to ensure that a sufficient number of priests would be available to meet the needs of the ever growing number of pilgrims, the shrine was handed over to the Oratorians. They built a convent behind the church and connected the two buildings with a long corridor. The Oratorians took care of the sanctuary until the French Republic annexed the Austrian Netherlands and dissolved all monasteries. The church then returned to the status of a parish church.Duerloo and Wingens 2002) pp. 43-69. Architecture and decoration of the basilica Interior of the basilica The archducal architect and engineer Wenceslas Cobergher is generally credited with designing the church and staking out the general outlay of the town of Scherpenheuvel. Both the church and the town are in fact determined by the Hortus Conclusus in the shape of a heptagon. The basilica is a central and domed structure, resting on seven columns. The main altar stands on the site of the oak tree. It is surrounded on six sides by chapels. The seventh side opens on to the vestibule, that is flanked by two more chapels. The side chapels are connected with an ambulatory, that enables pilgrims to walk round without entering the central space. On the opposite side of the vestibule stands the unfinished bell tower. Underneath the tower and on the outer walls are seven more altars. One of the most striking features of the exterior are the hundreds of seven-pointed gilded stars that cover the surface of the dome. The overall design of the church shows a lot of resemblance with the iconic but posterior (1631-1681) basilica of Santa Maria della Salute in Venice. The Lamentation of Christ by Theodoor van LoonThe main altar and six side-altars are decorated with altarpieces by Theodoor van Loon. They represent seven scenes from the life of the Virgin. The Encounter at the Golden Gate, serving as a depiction of the Immaculate Conception, the Birth of the Virgin, the Presentation of the Virgin, the Annunciation, the Visitation and the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple feature in the side chapels. The altarpiece of the main altar depicts the Assumption of the Virgin. A number of other paintings adorn the basilica, one of which is Theodoor van Loon's Lamentation of Christ.Duerloo and Wingens (2002) pp. 132-145. The statuary is by the sculptors de Nole and features the six statues of prophets on the columns in the central space of the basilica, four seated evangelists in the vestibule, as well as the two archangels flanking the main entrance.Duerloo and Wingens (2002) pp. 164-171. The iconographical program of the basilica is particularly rich. The recurrent use of the number seven (in the shape of the church and the town, the number of altars outside and inside, the shape of the stars on the dome) recalls the cult of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin. Building on a tradition dating from the late fifteenth century, Our Lady of Sorrows was considered the protectress of the unity of the Burgundian Netherlands. Built at a time that legitimate rule over the Low Countries was disputed between the monarchical and Catholic Southern Netherlands and the republican and Calvinist United Provinces, the cult of Our Lady of Sorrows harkened back to the days of political and religious unity.Duerloo and Wingens (2002) pp. 111-155. On a further level, the iconography of the basilica develops a defense of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception by employing a series of Marian emblems from the litanies. Thus the seven columns on which the dome rests, refer to the seven columns of the House of Wisdom or Domus sapientiae in Proverbs 9:1. With its archangels standing guard and side-altars dedicated to All Saints and All Angels, the entrance and vestibule constitute the Gateway to Heaven or Porta Caeli. The bell tower evokes the Tower of David or Turris Davidica from which one could supposedly see Shechem (or in the case of Scherpenheuvel Zichem/Sichem). Other such emblems include the Jacob's Ladder or Scala Jacob, the Ark of the Covenant or Arca Testamenti, the Strong City or Urbs Fortitudinis and of course the Closed Garden or Hortus Conclusus.Duerloo and Wingens (2002) pp. 95-181. Distinctions granted to the basilica Golden Rose of the Basilica of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel The statue of the Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel was solemnly crowned by Cardinal Victor-Auguste-Isidor Deschamps on behalf of Pope Pius IX on 25 August 1872. Fifty years later, Pope Pius XI accorded the church the status of a minor basilica on 2 May 1922. On 2 February 2011 Pope Benedict XVI dedicated that year's Golden Rose to the basilica. It was ceremoniously presented by the papal nuncio Mgr. Giacinto Berloco on 15 May. Traditional devotional practices The pilgrimage season runs from 1 May to the first week of November. In 2010 almost 1200 groups of pilgrims visited the shrine, with parties traveling from as far as Soest in the Netherlands and Fulda in Germany. (consulted April 22, 2011). Over the centuries many parishes or even towns adopted the practice of a collective pilgrimage. Quite a few have survived until today. Probably the best known is De Grote Trek that covers the 57 km from Antwerp to Scherpenheuvel and has been held on every first Sunday of May since 1931. Pilgrims that have made journey on foot 25 or 50 times are traditionally entitled to a special blessing with the statue of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel. On the Sunday after All Hallows the statue of the Virgin is carried round the basilica in the Kaarskensprocessie or Procession of Candles. It takes its name from the numerous candles that are lit by the faithful as the statue passes by. Every 25 years the crowning of the statue of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel is commemorated with great solemnity in what are known as the Kroningsfeesten. They were last held in 1997. Spread of the cult of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel Even before the official approbation of the cult of Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel, pilgrims took particles of the oak tree with them as pious souvenirs. Several stories of miracles attributed to the intercession by the Virgin relate of the thaumaturgic power of this Scherpenheuvel or Montague wood. Following the approbation, Archbishop Hovius ordered the tree to be cut down. It was divided in several parts. Some remained with the sanctuary; one particularly large piece was given to Albert and Isabella. Most of this Montague wood was used to make images of the Virgin Mary. Distributed as gifts among princes, nobles and clergy, they helped to disseminate the cult of Scherpenheuvel.Duerloo and Wingens (2002) pp. 39-41. Quite a few Belgian churches and convents came to possess an image carved in Montague wood. Well known examples remain in the Church of St. Charles Borromeo in Antwerp, the Church of St. Hilonius in Izegem and the chapel of the Capuchins in Enghien. In the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the statue of the national patron saint, Our Lady Comforter of the Afflicted or Our Lady of Luxembourg, is believed to contain Montague wood. A smallish statue of the Virgin and Child in Montague wood was taken by St. Marguerite Bourgeoys to Montreal and stands presently on her tomb in the Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel.Pallemaerts (1936). Some places of worship became closely associated with the cult of Scherpenheuvel. In the vicinity of their ch√¢teau of Mariemont, Albert and Isabella founded the priory of Montaigu in the present day municipality of Morlanwelz. In the town of Gray a statue of the Virgin made out of Montague wood became the object of a regional devotion. Likewise in the Franche-Comt√©, the statue donated to the priory of Bellefontaine in Brussey came to attract many pilgrims.Delsalle (2005)pp. 99-124. In the proximity of the Spanish Court, the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales obtained an altar dedicated to Nuestra Se√±ora de Monteagudo. The House of Lorraine had a particular devotion for Scherpenheuvel. Cardinal Charles of Lorraine, prince-bishop of Strasbourg, founded a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel in the noviciate of the Jesuits at Nancy. After his death in 1607, his sister Antoinette completed the project with an altarpiece depicting the ducal family venerating Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel. The chapel served as the repository of the embalmed hearts of the members of the House of Lorraine until 1720.Duerloo and Wingens (2002) pp. 107-109. The cult was also greatly favored by the French Queen Marie de' Medici. During her regency, the Discalced Augustinians obtained a statue in Montague wood at their church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. During her exile, she donated one statue in Montague wood to the city council of Cologne and another to the monastery of the Discalced Carmelites of that city. While serving the Catholic household of her daughter, Queen Henrietta Maria, the Queen's Chapel of St James's Palace likewise had an altar with a Madonna in Montague wood.Van Wyhe (2007) pp. 42-75.

The film was set against the backdrop of the Florida land boom of the 1920s, and stands as Ben Hecht's first film assignment. Background Partly filmed on location in Miami, the film is based upon a short story by Ring Lardner and was inspired by both the national baseball craze and the Florida land boom speculation of 1925. The film itself then inspired the 1926 Peggy Griffith novel The New Klondike ‚Äì A Story of a Southern Baseball Training Camp. The film proved successful enough to secure Thomas Meighan a long-term acting contract with Paramount. Plot Small-town pitcher Thomas Kelly (Thomas Meighan) is sent to Spring training with a minor league baseball team in Florida, but is fired by its jealous manager, Joe Cooley (Jack W. Johnston). Kelly is then talked into being the celebrity endorser for a Florida real estate firm, and his former teammates invest money in the firm through him. Still jealous of Kelly's popularity, Cooley conspires with crooked broker Morgan West (Robert Craig) to sell Kelly and the investors some worthless swampland. Kelly and his friends lose their money, but Kelly struggles to recoup the losses. He eventually makes a fortune, repays the investors, and is himself appointed team manager in place of Cooley.

It was the first attempt to establish a British presence in northern Tasmania, in 1804. It was a \\"bustling village\\" until 1808. History York Town was gazetted as a locality in 1967. All the original buildings have now gone, but the landscape and natural setting remain largely unchanged. The site is preserved as the York Town Historic Site and provided with interpretive signage. Extensive deposites of rich iron ore were discovered in the nearby hills by the settlers during the time of the York Town settlement. Later - in the 1870s - these iron deposits led to the establishment of a short-lived iron mining and smelting industry on the western side of the Tamar estuary at Redbill Point and at Ilfracombe (now known as Beauty Point).

Human remains were found at the site in 1996 that dated between 9,730 ¬±60 and 9,880¬±50 radiocarbon YBP (Years Before Present) or a calendrical date of 10,300 YBP. In addition to human skeletal remains, stone tools and animal bones were discovered. DNA analyses performed on the human skeletal remains document the presence of mitochondrial haplogroup D which occurs widely in the Americas. Isotopic analysis indicated that the individual had a primarily marine based diet.  Location  On Your Knees Cave is located on the northern tip off Prince of Wales Island within the Tongass National Forest. Its location is approximately one kilometer from the coast and 125 meters above sea level. Originally, the entrance of the cave was obstructed by large rocks and soil that had fallen from the cliff above, and covered with vegetation. After the obstructions were cleared, the small entrance later gave the cave its name. Inside is a long tunnel with an extremely low ceiling with old bear dens throughout.  Discovery  The site was first discovered in 1993 by the Tongass Cave Project, a joint cooperation between the Tongass National Forest and the National Speleological Society. Starting the following year, old bear dens within the cave were explored and numerous animal bones began to be found. Many different animal species were found during the excavations, including species now extinct on the island. After the discovery of animal bones in 1994, Timothy Heaton, paleontologist with the University of South Dakota-Vermillion at the time, lead the research project, assisted in 1996 and after by Fred Grady with the Smithsonian Institution. Brian Kemp, a molecular anthropologist, and E. James Dixon assisted in the analyses. However, the discovery of human skeletal remains in 1996 changed the direction of the research project. The human skeletal remains included a mandible with all but the incisors, partial remains of a right pelvis and other small fragments, 5 vertebrae, 3 maxillary incisors, and 1 maxillary canine. Stone tools were found among the animal and human bones. The stone tool material, obsidian, suggests trade or movement across water and land boundaries in the area.  Significance  On Your Knees Cave is currently one of the earliest known settlements along the Northwest Coast of North America. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) was extracted from one of the individual‚Äôs molars. The genetic analysis revealed that the individual Shuk√° K√°a was a male. Further examination of the teeth indicated that the man died in his mid-twenties. Through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the individual was determined to be a member of a subgroup of haplogroup D, marking the earliest occurrence of this haplogroup. This haplogroup is found in populations along the western coast of the Americas. A tribal group in the area of the discovery, the Tlingit, submitted DNA samples to be compared to the On Your Knees Cave individual. However, no match was found, indicating that the individual and modern Alaska Native American tribes are likely not closely related, although this does not mean that ancient Alaskan Native American groups would not have been closely related to the individual. Isotopic analyses conducted on the human skeletal remains revealed this individual‚Äôs diet was almost entirely marine protein. This, given On Your Knees Cave‚Äôs location on an island, suggests a maritime adaptation was present at an early time level in this region. One hundred animal bones samples from On Your Knees Cave underwent carbon-14 dating and the results indicated that during the past 40,000 years there was almost continuous occupation and use of the cave by animals, indicating the island was never completely glaciated or uninhabitable during this interval. The stone tools that were found within the cave were made at the site, but not of materials known to be from the site such as obsidian. Since the cave site is on an island and the lithic material was not known to the site, researchers have suggested that the individual and others at that time were mariners who could cross bodies of water by boats. The evidence from this site suggesting a marine based diet, extralocal artifacts, and a maritime adaptation supports a coastal migration model for the first Americans as proposed by K.R. Fladmark in 1979.  NAGPRA and the human skeletal remains  In accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, excavations at On Your Knees Cave were halted after the discovery of human skeletal remains in 1996. After the discovery, Heaton and other project leaders contacted and began consulting with local tribal governments in the area to determine the ownership of the remains. The rightful ownership was deemed to belong to the Tlingit people in Southeastern Alaska. The Tlingit had their reservations about allowing scientists to test the remains, but finally agreed to analyses of the human bones and further excavation if they were notified of any additional discoveries. This led to a 12-year-long partnership between the Tlingit Native American tribe and the scientific community. After the human skeletal remains had been studied for a time, they were repatriated to the Tlingit people for a reburial and a celebration festival.

This area contains the largest illegal waste dump in Europe due to a waste management crisis in the 1990s and 2000s. The region has experienced a rise in cancer-related mortality that is linked to exposure of pollution from the illegal waste disposal by the Camorra criminal organization after regional landfills had been filled to capacity.  Origin of the term  By February 1994, several regional landfills in Campania had become overfilled, and Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi declared a state of emergency and created the Committee for the Waste Emergency in Campania (Commissariato di Governo per l'emergenza rifiuti in Campania). The term \\"triangle of death\\" was first used with regards to the region in a September 2004 scientific publication in the Lancet Oncology. An estimated 550,000 people live in the triangle of death. The annual death rate per 100,000 inhabitants from liver cancer is approximately 38.4 for men and 20.8 for women in this area, as compared to the national average of 14. The death rate for bladder cancer and cancer of the central nervous system was also higher than the national average. The high death rates from cancers pointed towards the presence of illegal and improper hazardous waste disposal by various organized crime groups including the Camorra. The article noted, \\"Today, the difference between lawful management of waste and illegal manipulation with regard to their compliance with health regulations is very narrow, and the health risks are rising... The 5000 illegal or uncontrolled landfill sites in Italy drew particular criticism; Italy has already been warned twice for flouting the Hazardous Waste Directive and the Landfill Directive, and the EU has now referred Italy to the European Court of Justice for further action.\\" The report was met with criticism by the National Research Council, dismissing the methods used by Senior and Mazza as biased. Despite this, it sparked the first interest and concern into this matter, and has become the most cited source of evidence throughout the crisis. Though some media outlets report France and Germany as waste sources, the EU has remained silent as to the sources of the waste in its criticisms of and demands on Italy.  Illegal toxic waste dumping  By December 1999, all regional landfills had reached capacity. Reports in 2008 stated that the crisis was caused at least in part by the Camorra, the powerful Campania-based mafia, which created a lucrative business in the municipal waste disposal business, mostly in the triangle of death. With the complicity of industrial companies, heavy metals, industrial waste, and chemicals and household waste are frequently mixed together, dumped near roads and burned to avoid detection, leading to severe soil and air pollution.Mafia at centre of Naples' rubbish mess 9 January 2008. By Emmanuelle Andreani. Der Spiegel: In Naples, Waste Is Pure Gold Retrieved 20 March 2009 The phenomenon of widespread environmental crime perpetrated by criminal syndicates like the Camorra and 'Ndrangheta has given rise to the term \\"ecomafia\\". According to Giacomo D'Alisa et al., \\"the situation worsened during this period as the Camorra diversified their illegal waste disposal strategy: 1) transporting and dumping hazardous waste in the countryside by truck; 2) dumping waste in illegal caves or holes; 3) mixing toxic waste with textiles to avoid explosions and then burning it; and 4) mixing toxic with urban waste for disposal in landfills and incinerators.\\" A Camorra member, Nunzio Perella was arrested in 1992, and began collaborating with authorities; he had stated \\"the rubbish is gold.\\" The boss of the Casalesi clan, Gaetano Vassallo, admitted to systematically working for 20 years to bribe local politicians and officials to gain their acquiescence to dumping toxic waste. Giorgio Napolitano, President of Italian Republic, said in June 2008: The triangle of death and the waste management crisis is primarily a result of government failure to control illegal waste dumping. The government had attempted to mandate recycling and waste management programs, but were unable, causing the expansion of opportunities for illegal activities, which caused further barriers to solve the waste crisis. Pollutants such as dioxins are found in the area, particularly around Acerra, as well as illegal waste disposal, even in the business district of Montefibre. As early as 1987, a decree of the Ministry of Environment marked Acerra \\"at high risk of environmental crisis\\".D.C.d.M. 26-02-1987. High levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were detected both in the soil and in the inhabitants of the region. It is hypothesized that industrial slurry originating from Porto Marghera (industrial docklands near Venice) was disguised as compost and spread on fields in the Acerra countryside by the Casalesi clan, often with help from the landowners. In one case, a company had its assets seized during a 2006 investigation in which it was alleged that the company had illegally disposed of waste from industries in the regions of Veneto and Tuscany in the territories of Bacoli, Giugliano and Qualiano. Approximately one million tonnes of toxic waste are said to have been disposed of, earning ‚Ç¨27 million. The company was already the subject of a 2003 investigation. In another case, a tank full of toxic substances was found buried in an illegal dump, in Marigliano.Look at video by Striscia la notizia (italian TV information) The illegal burning of waste, for example to recover copper from wiring, is known to release dioxins into the atmosphere. Such fires are easily hidden among legitimate incineration resulting from the more general waste disposal problem, and the illegal burning of hazardous materials was particularly noted during 2007 and 2008. The presence of fires in the north area of Naples led author Roberto Saviano to use \\"Land of pyres\\" (terra dei fuochi) as chapter titles in his book Gomorrah. In 2000, a Parliamentary Commission inquiry about waste discovered some 800,000 tonnes of mud in Pianura landfill, coming from ACNA of Cengio in Naples, and the Italian Procura della Repubblica found (through telephone wiretappings) some irregularities in the waste disposal into the landfill of Villaricca, managed by FIBA (a company of the Impregilo group).  Opposition to landfills  Uncollected garbage in Naples, 2011. Between 2007 and 2008, the waste commissioner Guido Bertolaso, (the head of the civil protection department), planned to open a landfill but this was opposed by residents of Chiaiano. There was similar resistance in Pianosa to reopening a closed landfill proposed by government commissioner Giovanni De Gennaro. Some of the protests turned violent, and in May 2008, it became a penal felony to protest in the vicinity of landfills, incinerators or any plant related to waste management. It is alleged that there was collusion between local political interests and organised crime over building interests. By July 17, 2008, Berlusconi declared that the emergency had ended. The incinerator of Acerra was also received backlash in the local area. In 2009, the Acerra incineration facility was completed at a cost of over ‚Ç¨350 million. The incinerator burns 600,000 tons of waste per year to produce refuse-derived fuel. The energy produced from the facility is enough to power 200,000 households per year. Epidemiological research In 2007, researchLook at review into the review Trattamento dei rifiuti in Campania: impatto sulla salute umana dell Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanit√†, Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche e Regione Campania. conducted by the World Health Organization, Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche and Campania Region collected data on cancer and congenital abnormalities in 196 municipalities covering the period between 1994 and 2002 found abnormally high disease incidence. These abnormal patterns may correlate to areas where there are uncontrolled waste sites. However, this work also highlighted the difficulty in determining causality and in establishing a link between increased death and malformation rates and waste disposal. After the Senior and Mazza study, several other studies have been conducted to attempt to definitively link elevated cancer rates to waste exposure. A government-made waste-exposure index that classifies areas of the Campania region as high (5 on index) or low (1 on index) risk based on the type of wastes present in surrounding dumping sites, total waste volume greater than 10,000 cubic metres, and the likelihood of releases on water, soil and air was created. Statistically significant excess relative risks were found for several cancer types in the triangle of death, however, methods often struggle to account for lifestyle confounders such as tobacco consumption and occupation which could skew the results. A US Navy study denied any real ill effects to on-base personnel while however advising their off-base personnel to drink bottled water citing polluted wells. The US Navy report denied any signs of nuclear waste dumping and instead related the traces of uranium to volcanic activity. Pollution and agriculture exports  More than half of the regional land in Campania is used for agriculture, and therefore the economy of the region is adversely affected by the waste crisis. Between January and March 2007, 30,000 kilograms of waste were burned on agricultural land, with a revenue of more than ‚Ç¨118,000. In the region, over 12,000 cattle, river buffaloes and sheep had been culled before 2006. High levels of mortality and abnormal foetuses were also recorded in farms in Acerra linked to elevated levels of dioxin. Local studies have shown higher than permissible levels of lead in vegetables grown in the area. The government blames the Mafia's illegal garbage disposal racket. In March 2008, dioxin were found in buffalo milk from farms in Caserta.¬´So it was a blow when health authorities found high levels of dioxins, nasty byproducts of chemical manufacturing, in samples of buffalo milk from farms near Caserta, north of Naples, in recent weeks, and began a sweeping criminal investigation and the quarantine of dozens of herds of buffalo.¬ª, in The New York Times, Italy's Mozzarella Makers Fight Dioxin Scare, 21 March 2008 While only 2.8% of farms in Campania were affected, the sale of dairy products from Campania collapsed in both domestic and global markets. A chain reaction followed, in which several countries including Japan, China, Russia and Germany took various measures ranging from the mere raising of the attention threshold to the suspension of imports.Articoli vari The Italian institutions activated almost immediately, even in response to pressing requests from the European Union, a series of checks and suspended, in some cases, the sale of dairy products from the incriminated provinces. Tests had shown levels of dioxins higher than normal in at least 14% of samples taken in the provinces of Naples, Caserta and Avellino. In the provinces of Salerno and Benevento, no control indicated dioxins positivity. In any case, the contamination has affected, in a limited defined manner, the farms used to produce the PDO buffalo mozzarella DOP.Vedi il comunicato On 19 April, China definitively removed the ban on mozzarella, originally activated on 28 March 2008, and tests held in December 2013 in Germany on behalf of four Italian consumer associations have highlighted dioxin and heavy metal levels at least five times lower than the legal limit.I test tenuti in Germania assolvono la mozzarella bufala campana dop, Repubblica.it, 13-12-2013  References   External links  * La Terra dei fuochi, website showing claims on illegal waste disposal in Campania * La Terra dei fuochi, website on \\"triangle of poisons\\" Giugliano-Qualiano-Villaricca * Kathryn Senior and Alfredo Mazza, Italian ‚ÄúTriangle of death‚Äù linked to waste crisis, The Lancet Oncology, Volume 5, Issue 9, September 2004, Pages 525‚Äì527. * Translation by The Lancet Oncology from the site of Centro Nazionale di Epidemiologia, Sorveglianza e Promozione della Salute * Fabrizio Bianchi et al., Italian ‚ÄúTriangle of death‚Äù, The Lancet Oncology, Volume 12, Issue 5, December 2004, Page 710. * Trattamento dei rifiuti in Campania: impatto sulla salute umana, report by World Health Organization, Italian Health Institute, :it:Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche e Regione Campania (Italia). * Report: Terra bruciata, TV 9-3-2008, and how finished this story in: Come √® andata a finire?. * Repubblica Radio TV: Morire di diossina in Campania, del 28-12-2007: , , * La 7: Il cancro di Napoli, del 12-12-2007; Allarme cibo avvelenato, Exit del 18-12-2007; Il posto dei rifiuti, del 22-09-2007 * Tg1: interview to Roberto Saviano at 3-1-2008 (evening ediction at 8:00 p.m.) * Sat 2000: interview to dott.

The Whistleblower Protection Act was made into federal law in the United States in 1989. Whistleblower protection laws and regulations guarantee freedom of speech for workers and contractors in certain situations. Whistleblowers are protected from retaliation for disclosing information that the employee or applicant reasonably believes provides evidence of a violation of any law, rule, regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8)-(9), Pub.L. 101-12 as amended.  Law  The law covering whistleblowers falls under the category of Public law. = Public law = Public law governs the relationship between people and the state and comprises three types: constitutional law, criminal law, and administrative law. Constitutional law governs the principles and the powers of the government and the relationships between the different parts of the government. Criminal law restricts conduct that threatens safety and welfare of society or the state. Administrative law regulates the operation and the procedures of government agencies. The judicial branch of government interprets the laws, and its body of laws is called case law.

Civilians who occupy senior pay grades have similar requirements and restrictions. States are organized in much the same way, and governors issue executive orders.  Criminal  Hazardous chemical exposure provides an example of whistleblower action. Disclosure and product safety are the difference between legal insecticide application and assault with a deadly weapon. In most areas, the law requires physicians to file a report for \\"Any person suffering from any wound or other physical injury inflicted upon the person where the injury is the result of assaultive or abusive conduct.\\" Mandated reporters are obligated to submit a report to a local law enforcement agency as follows. # The name and location of the injured person, if known. # The character and extent of the person's injuries. # The identity of any person the injured person alleges inflicted the wound, other injury, or assaultive or abusive conduct upon the injured person. Employers must inform and train employees before insecticide exposure to avoid criminal prosecution that could occur in addition to workers' compensation obligations when the employee consults a physician. In United States common law, non-criminal battery is \\"harmful or offensive\\" contact resulting in an injury that does not include intent to commit harm. This is called tortuous battery, and this falls into the same category as automobile accidents which are handled with workers' compensation. This is applicable even if there is a delay between the harmful act and the resulting injury.See, e.g. Fisher v Carrousel Motor Hotel, Inc., 424 S.W.2d 627 (1967).See, e.g., Leichtman v. WLW Jacor Communications, 92 Ohio App.3d 232 (1994) (cause of action for battery where tortfeasor blew cigarette smoke in another's face). The definition of criminal battery is (1) unlawful application of force (2) to the person of another (3) resulting in bodily injury. For example, an employer commits a crime if they fail to disclose insecticide exposure in accordance with public law (unlawful force) then subsequently violates the product labeling in the assigned work area (to the person), resulting in permanent disability (bodily injury). Insecticide injury is an accident and not a crime if EPA is informed, employees are adequately trained before exposure, and products are correctly labeled. Similar principles apply to rental property occupants, occupants of public buildings like schools, and customers exposed by a business owner. Criminal penalties also exist within the Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act regarding company finance. Financial irregularities involving Misappropriation is one area where criminal penalties apply to federal managers. Funds allocated by Congress for one purpose may not be spent for a different purpose, including payroll. The U.S. Navyhttp://nawctsd.navair.navy.mil/Resources/Library/Acqguide/appropriations.htm provides an example. Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001 establishes criminal penalties for false statements. This applies to false statements exchanged between federal employees, including managers, appointed officials, and elected officials. Criminal penalties also apply when crimes occur in the workplace, as is often the case with an injury. For example, an illness that results after workplace exposure to hazardous substances requires medical evaluation. For the evaluation, access to the product's safety data sheet that contained the hazardous substance is required, as well as verification of workers compensation. Failure to post mandatory information is a crime. Retaliation remedies are limited to withholding payroll from the manager and civil remedies that involve the Civil Service Reform Act. State laws are also applicable to federal workers, and California provides an example. * California Labor Code Section 6425  State law  Some states have statutes regarding whistleblowing protections, for example, New York.N.Y. Labor Law ¬ß 740. A school nurse who was fired due to mandated reportingSee N.Y. Social Services L. ¬ß 413. of a single case of child abuse that was allegedly \\"covered up,\\" could seek protection under New York law.Vilarin v. Rabbi Haskel Lookstein School, 96 A.D. 1 (1st Dep't 2012).Leonard M. Rosenberg, \\"In New York Courts\\", NYSBA Health Journal, 6, Summer/Fall 2012 (Vol. 17, No. 3).  U.S. labor law and policy  Employer activity that is not prohibited by law is usually permitted. Ignorance of the law does not make something legal. Managers cannot order people to participate in situations involving something that is illegal, unethical, or unhealthful. When a worker feels that this is the case, they may file a dispute. Workers will often prevail if some kind of law or public policy can be used to justify a dispute. When a dispute goes to grievance, then laws and policies need to be cited, otherwise, the dispute may fail. The Prohibited Personnel Practices Act amended United States Code, Title 5: Government Organization and Employees to provide federal employees with whistleblower protection. The law forbids retaliation for whistleblowing. One of the more pressing concerns is workplace safety. Failure to satisfy building codes established by the International Code Council can have a negative impact on occupational safety. Buildings constructed before 1990 probably do not satisfy these requirements. As an example, managers may not recognize the reason for elevated illness rates when fresh air ventilation for the building is shut down. The building no longer satisfies OSHA laws and building codes without fresh air. EPA recommends fresh air exchange of no less than 15 cfm/person to prevent the accumulation of toxic chemicals in the air, like the carbon dioxide that is exhaled in human breath. Inadequate fresh air will cause illness or death due to excess buildup of toxic gasses inside buildings. Building codes applicable to most areas of the United States are as follows: * Air ventilation: EPA * International Building Code * International Mechanical Code * International Plumbing Code * National Electric Code * National Fire Protection Association  Supreme Court  The US Supreme Court has limited whistleblower protections for public disclosures based on free speech for most government workers. Garcetti v. Ceballos held that the First Amendment does not apply to situations that fall within the scope of the job description associated with the employment of each government worker. The Supreme Court decision means that government management may discipline government employees who publicly disclose crime and incompetence under certain circumstances. Job-related functions are supposed to be disclosed to management by grievance to the Inspector General, to the [Office of Special Counsel], to appointed officials, or to elected officials. Issues that exist outside the job-description are not prohibited by Garcetti v. Ceballos. Public disclosure of the work environment not related to work assignments does not compromise essential functions like national security and law enforcement. In theory, criminal penalties apply to managers that discipline employees for public disclosure of situations outside the job description. The following are some examples of situations outside the job description. * Undisclosed hazardous material exposure when the hazard is not in the job description * Unauthorized acceptance of defective goods or services when the defect is not associated with the job description * Sexual harassment, racial discrimination, slander, and stalking * Failure to provide meals, breaks, and rest time * Compulsory work assignments without pay.  Disclosing misconduct, free speech and retaliation  Federal and state statutes protect employees from retaliation for disclosing other employee's misconduct to the appropriate agency. The difficulty with the free speech rights of whistleblowers who make their disclosures public, particularly those in national defense, that involve classified information can threaten national security. Civilian employees and military personnel in the intelligence gathering and assessment field are required to sign non-disclosure agreements, a practice upheld by the Supreme Court in Snepp v. United States. Courts have ruled that secrecy agreements circumscribing an individual's disclosure of classified information did not violate their First Amendment rights. Non- disclosure agreements signed by employees create similar conflicts in private business. The United States Office of Special Counsel provides training for the managers of federal agencies on how to inform their employees about whistleblower protections, as required by the Prohibited Personnel Practices Act (5 USC ¬ß 2302). The law forbids retaliation for whistleblowing. (See: U.S. Labor Law and Policy above.)  Acts  = False Claims Act of 1863 = The False Claims Act (a.k.a.: the Lincoln Law) states details describing the process of an employee who files a complaint that turns out not to be valid. Congress enacted the law to provide a legal framework to deal with military contractors engaged in defrauding the federal government. This fraud occurred through either the overcharging of products or providing defective war material, including food and weapons. The original issue that spurred Congressional action was the sale of defective cannons. These cannons were known to blow up and cause casualties among Union troops. This law specifies that the employee filing the complaint can be held accountable for a false claim if they knew their claim was invalid to begin with when they decided to file it. If it is found that the person knew what they were claiming was untrue, then they are liable for no less than double the damages. The law provides for civil, but not criminal, penalties and provided a financial incentive for whistleblowers. The incentive equals 15 to 30 percent of the money recovered, which can amount to millions of dollars. In addition to financial compensation, the False Claims Act offers limited protection for workers who provide tips about defective products and services delivered to the U.S. government. This prohibits firing the employee who provided the tip. The statute of limitations may span six years. The False Claims Act provides civil remedies for non-government workers. Qui tam is a provision under the False Claims Act that allows private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. Separate remedies are available for government workers. This False Claims Act helps to make sure claims are truthful, accurate, valid, and fair. If every employee filed a complaint just to file a complaint and be compensated for it, it would not be very reliable or fair. = Lloyd‚ÄìLa Follette Act of 1912 = The Lloyd‚ÄìLa Follette Act was passed in Congress in 1912 to guarantee the right of federal employees to communicate with members of Congress. The bill was the first to protect whistleblowers. It established procedures for the liberation of federal employees from their employer and it gave them the right to join unions. The act states that \\"the right of employees... to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be interfered with or denied.\\" This legislation prohibits payroll compensation for managers who retaliate against employees who attempt to provide whistleblower disclosure (pay to the manager is suspended). The intent is to provide direct feedback to Congress from federal employees, most of whom work within the executive branch. This does not provide protections for employees who violate disclosure rules associated with unauthorized classified information disclosure and other types of unauthorized public disclosure associated with issues like law enforcement investigation and juvenile records. Unauthorized disclosures of classified information are prohibited, so job-specific issues should be disclosed to the appropriate legislative committee, where members should hold the appropriate clearance. As a general rule, Lloyd‚ÄìLa Follette disclosures should cover a topic that will benefit the government if the issue could be resolved by Congressional involvement when the resolution would not be supported as a beneficial suggestion and would be opposed by management. = Freedom of Information Act of 1966 = The Freedom of Information Act of 1966 can provide access to information required to pursue a whistleblower action. FOIA provides the public the right to request access to records from any federal agency. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. Federal agencies are required to disclose any information requested under the FOIA unless it falls under one of nine exemptions which protect interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement. The nine exemptions are as follows: * Exemption 1: Information that is classified to protect national security. * Exemption 2: Information related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. * Exemption 3: Information that is prohibited from disclosure by another federal law. * Exemption 4: Trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is confidential or privileged. * Exemption 5: Privileged communications within or between agencies, including:  Deliberative process privilege  Attorney- work product privilege  Attorney-client privilege * Exemption 6: Information that, if disclosed, would invade another individual's personal privacy. * Exemption 7: Information compiled for law enforcement purposes that:  a) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings  b) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication  c) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy  d) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source  e) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions  f) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual * Exemption 8: Information that concerns the supervision of financial institutions. * Exemption 9: Geological information on wells. The FOIA also requires agencies to proactively post online certain categories of information, including frequently requested records. As an example, the use of hazardous chemicals must be disclosed to employees, such as pesticides. Injury due to hazardous chemical exposure, radiation, and other hazards permanently disable 100,000 federal workers each year. Notification of hazardous chemical exposure is also required by Right to know. Right to know is necessary for workplace safety involving things like chemical injury, radiation injury and other occupational illnesses where the cause may not be discovered by physicians without disclosures that are required by law. Workplace hazards must be prominently displayed and public hazards must be disclose to state and county agencies. A FOIA request is the most valuable law that supports Whistleblower actions when a Right to know violation has occurred. This kind of request cannot be made anonymously and fees may be required. There may be an advantage if the request is made through an unrelated individual, such as a union official or another member of the community. Right to know is just one example of many reasons why an FOIA request may be needed to pursue a whistleblower action. = Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 = The Civil Service Reform Act was the second protection adopted, but it gave protections only to federal employees. Later, the [Whistleblower Protection Act] of 1989 would provide protections to those individuals who work in private-sectors. Government workers who experience retaliation as a result of whistleblower retaliation may pursue defense against those actions under the authority of this Act. This established the following organizations to manage the federal workforce within the executive branch of government: * Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)http://www.mspb.gov/ * Office of Personnel Management (OPM) * Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) These cover most of the three million federal workers within the United States. The MSPB is a quasi-judicial organization with enforcement authority for prohibited personnel actions. MSPB is also responsible for reimbursing legal fees in some situations. Issues that involve discrimination and harassment are pursued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This may include failure to accommodate disability, in addition to inequities involving gender or race. Federal workers are entitled to financial benefits.http://redbook.gao.gov/6/fl0027620.php Thus, a whistle-blower action should include a beneficial suggestion to reserve the right to potential financial compensation for job-related improvement suggestions. * Defense Efficiency * U.S. Air Forcehttp://www.afmc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123035498 * U.S. Armyhttps://asp.hqda.pentagon.mil/public/default.htm * U.S. Marineshttp://www.marines.mil/unit/marforres/4thMLG/GroupOrders/GruO%201650.9B.pdf * U.S. Navyhttps://www.cnic.navy.mil/navycni/groups/public/@pub/cnrnw/documents/document/cnip_041867.pdf * White House Other remedies may be available if a federal worker is unable to return to work. Employees with over five years' government service may be eligible for early retirement if medical records support a finding of disability not accommodated in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Retirement rules are listed in the OPM Retirement Settlement Guide. Early retirement due to medical disability affects about 100,000 federal workers every year. There are two retirement systems: * CSRS Disability Retirement * FERS Disability Retirement The FLRA is an independent administrative federal agency covering certain collective bargaining rights (unions). Postal employee collective bargaining is covered by the Postal Reorganization Act under the United States Postal Service. = Ethics in Government Act of 1978 = United States Office of Government Ethics The U.S. Office of Government Ethicshttps://www.oge.gov/ is the supervising ethics office for the executive branch. Supervising ethics offices for other branches of government are as follows. * Senate Select Committee on Ethics * House Committee on Standards of Official Conducthttp://www.house.gov/ethics * Judicial Conference Committee on Codes of Conduct The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 was put in place so that government officials have their salaries put on public record for all to see. This was a result of the Nixon Watergate scandal and the Saturday Night Massacre. It created a mandatory, public disclosure of financial and employment history of government officials and their immediate family members for the regular U.S. citizen to have access to view. For example, if you were working within public service, your salary and other financial information relating to your job becomes public record within 30 days of becoming hired by the government. The Ethics in Government Act provides three protections that apply to whistleblowers. They are as follows: * Mandatory, public disclosure of financial and employment history of public officials and their immediate family. * Restrictions on lobbying efforts by public officials for a set period of time after leaving public office. * Creates the U.S. Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) to investigate government officials. The U.S. (OIC) deals with ethical rules that cover all government employees and the OIC is responsible for documenting the whistleblower process. * Prohibited Personnel Practiceshttp://www.osc.gov/ppp.htm * Whistleblower Disclosureshttp://www.osc.gov/wbdisc.htm One whistleblower caution is that political activity is prohibited by government employees. Whistleblower contact with elected or appointed officials must include no references to political support, political opposition, and campaigns. Another caution is that whistleblowers who have to leave government employment are given time limits that prohibit employment by entities where the government employee was responsible for any contractual interactions. The former government employee may be prohibited from interacting in an official capacity directly with former coworkers who are still employed by the government. = Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 = The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 was enacted to protect federal employees who disclose \\"Government illegality, waste, and corruption\\" from adverse consequences related to their employment. This act provides protection to whistleblowers who may receive demotions, pay cuts, or a replacement employee. There are certain rules stated in this act that are civil protection standards against voidance of dismissal, voidance of cancellation of worker dispatch contracts, and disadvantageous treatment (i.e. demotion or a pay cut). The court judges what is considered valid or not for each complaint filed for dismissal or cancellation. However, there are certain limitations to the Protection Act. For example, this act does not cover tax laws or regulate money used in political activities. It is in these political campaigns where whistleblowing is more effective in comparison to other organizations. Whistleblowers are required to present information and other documents that can back up their claims when filing a dispute. If it is found that they are lying, they may be subjected to criminal charges. The Supreme Court has ruled this protection only applies to government workers when the disclosure is not directly related to the job. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) uses agency lawyers in the place of \\"administrative law judges\\" to decide federal employees' whistleblower appeals. These lawyers, dubbed \\"attorney examiners,\\" deny 98% of whistleblower appeals; the Board and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals give great deference to their initial decisions, resulting in affirmance rates of 97% and 98%, respectively.[Robert J. McCarthy, \\"Blowing in the Wind: Answers for Federal Whistleblowers,\\" 3 WILLIAM & MARY POLICY REVIEW 184 (2012)] Whistleblower Protection does not always protect federal workers. The Supreme Court ruling excludes whistleblower actions covered in the job description for federal workers. Job related issues must go through the hierarchy of the organization. When that fails, the issue must be brought to the attention of MSPB, EEOC, or OPM if it impacts employment. Unclassified issues not directly related to the job that in turn do not have a negative impact on national security or law enforcement may be suitable for public disclosure. Public disclosure would cover things like sexual harassment, racism, stalking, slander, and pesticide exposure, if you are not employed as an exterminator. Crimes involving public transportation or federal employees should be disclosed to the Inspector General for Department of Transportation. Although the Whistleblower Protection Act has some limitations, its main goals are to help eliminate corporate scandals and promote agreements in companies that coordinate with other legislations. = No FEAR Act of 2002 = The No Fear Act stands for Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act and was made effective in 2002. It discourages federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation and holds them accountable when they violate antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws. It was found that agencies cannot be run effectively if federal agencies practice or tolerate discrimination. The main purpose is to pay awards for discrimination and retaliation violations out of the agency budget. Employer obligations under the No FEAR Act are as follows (requires annual training): * Notify federal employees, former federal employees, and applicants for federal employment about their rights under the Federal Antidiscrimination, Whistleblower Protection, and Retaliation Laws * Post statistical data relating to Federal sector equal employment opportunity complaints on its public website * Ensure that managers have training in the management of a diverse workforce, early and alternative conflict resolution, and essential communications skills * Conduct studies on the trends and causes of complaints of discrimination * Implement new measures to improve the complaint process and the work environment * Initiate timely and appropriate discipline against employees who engage in misconduct related to discrimination or reprisal * Reimburse the Judgment Fund for any discrimination and whistleblower related settlements or judgments that reach in Federal court * Produce annual reports of status and progress to Congress, the Attorney General, and the U.S. Equal Employment Commission = Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act of 2002 = The Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act (SOX) of 2002 was established to assist in the regulation of financial practice by corporate governance. It was devised by Congress to help with deficiencies in the business environment. This law was made in response to the failure of other laws that resulted in bankruptcy and fraudulent accounts. It was made to help regulate businesses to not commit fraud. Federal provisions were made in addition to state laws, which provided a balance in state and federal regulations in the business industry. It established mandatory whistleblower disclosures, under certain circumstances, if mandated reporters fail to disclose, that could result in criminal penalties. This requires registration and accurate reporting for funding instruments, like stocks and bonds used to finance private industry. Some corporate officers are required to report irregularities (mandated reporters). Whistleblower disclosures involving securities and finance should be made to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the state attorney general, or the local District attorney.  National security protections  The whistleblower laws and executive orders that specifically apply to U.S. intelligence-community employees include the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA), Presidential Policy Directive 19, and the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.http://www.pen.org/sites/default/files/Secret%20Sources%20report.pdf National security whistleblowers do not currently have court access to challenge retaliation. The current system for enforcing intelligence-community whistleblowers' rights against reprisal is entirely internal; however, the Congressional, intelligence committees can intervene to help ensure that the whistleblower is protected, and an appeals mechanism was added in recent years. Under this framework, intelligence- community whistleblowers are not protected from retaliation if they raise \\"differences of opinions concerning public-policy matters,\\" but are protected if they raise violations of laws, rules, or regulations. This makes it difficult for national-security employees to raise questions about the overarching legality or constitutionality of policies or programs operated under secret law, like the NSA's mass- surveillance programs. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) was passed in 1998. This law provides a secure means for employees to report to Congress allegations regarding classified information. The law, which applies to both employees and contractors, requires the whistleblower to notify the agency head, through an Inspector General, before they can report an \\"urgent\\" concern to a Congressional intelligence committee. The law doesn't prohibit employment-related retaliation, and it provides no mechanism, such as access to a court or administrative body, for challenging retaliation that may occur as a result of having made a disclosure. In October 2012, Barack Obama signed Presidential Policy Directive 19, after provisions protecting intelligence-community whistleblowers were stripped from the proposed Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. It was designed to ensure that employees who serve in the Intelligence community, or have access to classified information, can effectively report waste, fraud, and abuse, while protecting classified information. The order prohibits retaliation against intelligence community employees who make a protected disclosure through the proper, internal channels and establishes remedies for substantiated, retaliation claims. The directive requires each intelligence-community agency to establish policies and procedures that prohibit retaliation and to create a process through which the agency's Inspector General can review personnel or security clearance decisions alleged to be retaliatory. The directive also creates a process by which a whistleblower can appeal an agency-level decision regarding a retaliation claim to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, who can then decide whether or not to convene a review panel of three inspectors general to review it. The panel can only make recommendations to the head of the original agency where the complaint was first lodged and cannot actually require agencies to correct it. PPD-19 does not protect contractors from any form of reprisal except decisions connected to their security clearance, which leaves them open to retaliatory terminations, investigations and criminal prosecutions. According to whistleblower lawyer Mark Zaid, excluding contractors was \\"a remarkable and obviously intentional oversight, given the significant number of contractors who now work within the intelligence community. This is a gap that desperately needs to be closed, as I often have contractors coming to me with whistleblower-type concerns and they are the least protected of them all.\\" National security contractors used to have stronger whistleblower rights under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), which protected Department of Defense contractors against reprisal. The law also created a process through which contractors could request a remedy, initially through agency Inspector General investigations and subsequently through access to district court jury trials for civil complaints. The law covered close to 60 percent of government contractors, including NSA, DIA and other intelligence community whistleblowers working at the Pentagon, but it didn't cover CIA contractors. These rights were subsequently removed through the 2013 NDAA (passed prior to Edward Snowden's disclosures) and no longer apply. As a result, according to PEN America, since 2013 intelligence community contractors (such as Edward Snowden) \\"have had significantly fewer (and weaker) protections than other government contractors, and no statutory protection against retaliation (with the exception of security clearance-related reprisals, from which they are protected from under PPD-19).\\" Some whistleblower advocates believe that the framework created by PPD-19 is insufficient and that intelligence community whistleblowers will have effective, meaningful rights only if they are given access to courts to challenge retaliation. The 2014 Intelligence Authorization Act, which was signed into law on July 7, 2014, codifies some protections from PPD-19.  Reporting  To qualify for an award under the Security and Exchange Commission's Whistleblower Program, information regarding possible securities law violations must be submitted to the Commission in one of the following ways: * Online through the Commission's Tip, Complaint or Referral Portal; or. * By mailing or faxing a Form TCR to: SEC Office of the Whistleblower. First, when submitting a tip, it is important to use the Form TCR, which is required to be considered a whistleblower for this program. It contains declarations of eligibility that one must sign off on. A tip can be submitted anonymously, but if this is the case, one must be represented by counsel. When a whistleblower tip is submitted, a TCR submission number will be given in return. When a TCR is submitted to the SEC, their attorneys, accountants, and analysts will review the data submitted to determine how best to proceed. If it is a matter the Enforcement Division is working on already, the TCR gets forwarded to the staff handling that matter. Often a TCR gets sent to the experts in another Division at the SEC for their evaluation. Even if the tip does not cause an investigation to be opened right away, the information provided is retained and may be reviewed again in the future if more facts come to light. If the tip submitted does cause an SEC investigation, the enforcement staff will follow the facts to determine whether to charge an individual, entity, or both with securities violations. These investigations can take months, or even years to be concluded. If a matter in which over one million dollars in sanction is ordered is final, a Notice of Covered Action will be posted on the SEC website. The Whistleblower then has 90 days to submit a Form WB-APP to apply for an award. From there, deeper analysis is required by the Commission's rules to determine whether to pay an award, and, if so, how much. The Commission's rules describe seven factors used to determine whether to increase or decrease the percentage of an award. The four factors that may increase an award are: # the significance of the information provided by the whistleblower # the assistance provided by the whistleblower # any law enforcement interest that might be advanced by a higher award # the whistleblower's participation in internal compliance systems - as in, if you reported on a company that you currently or used to work for, did you report internally first, and did you participate in any internal investigation There are also three factors that can decrease the percentage of an award. They are as follows: # culpability # an unreasonable reporting delay by the whistleblower # interference with internal compliance and reporting systems The best thing to do in order to make the tip useful is to provide specific, timely, and credible information. The staff will be able to pursue an investigation of the tip if they have specific examples, details, or transactions to examine. So, the more information and specifics provided, the better. Any updates or developments that occur along the way should also be sent in. It is also helpful to understand that the Commission considers both positive and negative factors when determining an award percentage. Lastly, it is important to note that the securities laws can be very complex and that SEC enforcement actions can take years to be finalized once reported. =Federal workers= Federal workers notify the Secretary of Laborhttp://www.dol.gov/_sec/welcome.htm when unsafe working conditions are not addressed by management. Senior executives and military officers at the rank colonel, captain, or above have an obligation to act on whistleblower information. Financial or business irregularities may be reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Attorney General, District Attorney, Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, or other law-enforcement agency. If the reported information is classified, then the recipient should have a need to know and must hold a security clearance. The need-to-know criteria generally means that the issue being disclosed will benefit the government if the dispute is resolved. A dispute that does not provide a benefit to the government is more appropriate for a labor dispute. Federal employment is governed by the Merit Promotion Protection Board. This applies to positions that are not filled by election or appointment. Federal employees are covered by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which offers inferior protection. Workers who report crime or incompetence may get injured while at work. Federal workers, energy workers, long shoremen, and coal workers injured at work should contact the US Department of Labor, Office of Workers Compensation. =Private companies and non-profit organizations= Employees working for private companies notify organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Even though EPA and OSHA may provide no direct services for government workers, a report should be filed. Government ethics laws are a complicated maze with unpredictable combinations. As an example, any business interests and tax records for a public employee is public domain because disclosure is required by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 () and this information should be made available to anyone who requests that information because of the Freedom of Information Act. This applies to all government employees, including elected and political appointments. Employees working for private companies are also protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Private companies and non-profit organizations benefit when whistleblower protection is included in company policies and bylaws. Fines, penalties, and lawsuits may be avoided when immunity from prosecution is granted to any employee who notifies an owner or member of the board of directors when other employees or managers become involved in unethical or illegal activity on behalf of the organization. Workers must assert their rights to obtain any kind of protection. =Unionization= Unions may provide additional legal protection that may be unavailable without unionization. The National Labor Review Board (NRLB)http://www.nlrb.gov/what-we-do helps to form federal unions, investigate charges, seek resolutions, decide cases, and enforce orders. The NRLB oversees the formation of the union, petitions, and election processhttp://www.nlrb.gov/what-we-do/conduct-elections associated with selecting union officials. Employers are obligated to inform employees about assistance programs associated with workplace injuries or illness, and union representatives are obligated to follow up on this information. Employers are required to allow the local union representative to attend meetings. The employer cannot interfere with support provided by the union representative. A collective bargaining agreement (a contract) is a set of bylaws that establishes a partnership agreement between two groups of people, where one group is management and the other group is employees. The collective bargaining agreement also provides the same protection for managers, except managers are not entitled to union representation during labor disputes. The collective bargaining agreement is separate from the union charter, which is the set of rules and regulations governing the activities of the labor union members. * Voting and elections * Union meetings * Meeting notification * Funds Labor contracts involve Common Law established by court decisions (except in Louisiana), torts (private or civil law), and public law. A union may be organized as a business or corporate entity under U.S. Code Title 26, Section 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4) and/or 501(c)(5) if the labor organization is large enough to conduct banking transactions. A bank, credit union, savings and loan, or other financial organization can be consulted to determine the local requirements needed to establish an account. This allows funds to be collected for a common purpose. = Labor disputes = Labor disputes typically refer to controversy between an employer and its employees regarding the terms (such as conditions of employment, fringe benefits, hours of work, tenure, wages) to be negotiated during collective bargaining, or the implementation of already agreed upon terms. One caution related to a labor dispute is that all union leadership team members are also employees, and these employees have job assignments. Lighter job assignments are usually given union leaders. In addition to not requiring the union leadership team members to be in the workplace during work hours, this can often include fewer travel assignments. Management has the right to change the job assignment for union leaders. This includes family separation using long-term travel assignments. The whistleblower must understand the labor dispute process because union leadership may be corrupt. The employee should initiate a labor dispute to protect their employment rights when reprisal occurs after a whistleblower disclosure. Employee rights are protected by labor law in the United States. These rights are not automatically guaranteed if the employee fails to start the process in a timely manner. Employees with no collective bargaining organization are directly represented by state labor boards, unemployment offices, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This describes employees where no union steward is available at the work-site. The dispute must be disclosed to the employer. If there is a union contract, then the process described in the contract should be followed. If there is no union agreement, then a disagreement with the employer should be discussed directly with government organizations that provide employee protection for the area of the disagreement. A labor dispute that progresses beyond words begins with a grievance. = Grievances = A grievance is an official complaint by an employee about an employer's actions believed to be wrong or unfair. The grievance starts a timer that usually prohibits the employer from taking negative action against the employee (and union steward). For example, a whistleblower complaint prohibits negative employer action for 90 to 180 days. A conventional grievance should provide a 30-day window. This prohibits things like workplace lockout, withholding payroll and firing. Each new employer action can be used to justify a new grievance. When an employee grievance prevails, the lower-level supervisors who were involved in the dispute may be temporarily prohibited from promotion. Manager pay may be suspended in situations where there was a whistleblower reprisal or other crime. This provides a manager incentive to not use unethical tactics. The employee should ensure that the nature of the dispute is factual, justified, and substantiated. Factual means no false or misleading statements. Justified means there must be legal justification to sway a judge or jury to favor the employee. Substantiated means there must be evidence, testimonials, and witnesses to support the facts stated. A grievance should include the following: * Organization information (name and location) * Employee contact information (name, address, and telephone) * Manager contact information (name, address, and telephone) * Employee occupation * Nature of complaint * Desired resolution * Employee signature and date * Manager reply, signature, and date The original grievance is given to the first-level manager, and a copy is kept for the immediate supervisor. If there is a union, then a copy should be given to a member of the union leadership team. If the manager reply is unacceptable, then the grievance is updated, attached to copies of the original, and given to the manager who supervises of the first-level manager (second-level supervisor). This continues from manager to manager upward through the organization. The time allowed for each manager response is usually 30 days. The time allowed for the employee response is usually seven days. The nature of the complaint may expand to include further information at each step. When an employee dispute involves an employer that is a member of a collective-bargaining unit, then the grievance process is described in the collective-bargaining agreement. U.S. Code Title 5 Section 7121 for federal workers provides an example framework. If no resolution is achieved at the top level for the local organization, or if the process takes too long, then the process is brought to the attention of the appropriate, government organization. Collective bargaining protects the employer as much as the employee. The grievance process described above provides time for the employer to correct situations that violate ethical rules or laws before enforcement action becomes necessary. Federal employees who are members of a union are generally restricted to binding arbitration. Employees not limited to binding arbitration may sue in court. If there is no labor union, if the union dispute process has produced no productive results, or if the process takes too long, then the issue is submitted to the National Labor Review Board,http://www.nlrb.gov/ Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Merit Promotion Protection Board, the Inspector General, Senator, Representative,https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml the President, the Department of Justice, the Industrial Accidents Board,http://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/all50.htm or other organization. A copy should be mailed to the officer or senior executive in charge of the top-level managers in the local organization because other employees may interfere with regular delivery. A grievance needs to cite an issue involving tort law, common law, or public law to be effective. There is no obligation for any enforcement action for issues that do not violate law. Some common reasons for employee complaints are as follows: * Failure to provide pay for hours worked * Criminal activity * Dangerous activity * Assault * Failure to provide time for meals/breaks * Failure to provide safe working conditions * Hostile work environment (i. e. harassment) * Failure to accommodate handicap are most common reasons for employee complaints. = Meetings = The direct supervisor may order an employee to attend a meeting. The employee must attend a meeting during regular working hours, but there are limitations. U.S. government employees cannot leave the meeting or work area, except in situations involving disability or illness. Government leave policy is established by public law. Employees working for private companies operate under different rules, and if state laws require time for employee breaks and meals, restricting employee movement could be an arrest in some areas. Due to unequal protection, government employees are at greater risk of serious abuse by managers. The state labor board should be consulted for more information. One word of caution is that Fifth Amendment protection may be lost if the employee answers questions, and it is necessary to reassert this right during the meeting after answering any questions. The meeting may involve very little conversation after the employee has asserted their constitutional rights and demanded the details of the accusation. The employee must also assert their rights. Department of Labor should be consulted for more information.http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/osdbu/sbrefa/poster/matrix.htm Employees must assert additional rights when ordered to attend a meeting that may involve any type of dispute. There is nothing that requires an employee to provide any information during a meeting if the topic involves a labor dispute, but the employee is entitled to be told the specific nature of any possible dispute. The following should be demanded: * Job description * Performance evaluation criteria * Performance evaluation * Improvement expectations Employees must never make false statements during any meeting, and meeting participants risk fine or prison when false statements are made when a federal worker is present. False statements made in the presence of a federal employee are a crime, and this includes any statement made during an official meeting at a federal facility. Some states may have similar laws. A court order may be required for telephone voice recording in some areas. Ordinary voice recording in some areas, such as California, requires consent of all parties before the recording can be used in a courtroom or during arbitration. Most meeting minutes are documented in writing by all parties, and the minutes are signed and dated at the end of the meeting. The employees should request the specific nature of any accusation under the Sixth Amendment with the assumption that an unresolved dispute will be decided in a courtroom under the protections provided by the Seventh Amendment. Employees cannot be compelled to answer questions about potential crimes under the assumption that all such questions fall under the protection of the Fifth Amendment. No employee may be denied these protections for any reason. The specific constitutional protections are as follows: Fifth: ... nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law... Sixth: ... the accused shall enjoy the right... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him... Seventh: ... where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved... Fourteenth: ... nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws... If the meeting is a disciplinary hearing or a performance appraisal meeting for a government employee, and if the employee is told that any area of job performance is less-than-perfect, then the employee is entitled to be told about specific improvements for each less-than-perfect rating. The appraisal must fall within the boundaries of the job description. If any area of the appraisal falls outside the scope of any diploma, license, or prior training used during the hiring process, then the employer is responsible for training necessary to improve the skills that are part of the evaluation. The employer is required to allow an improvement period before reevaluation. Some employers may require employees to pay for their own training in some areas as a hiring condition. Another protection is false imprisonment. The employer cannot lock doors and cannot forcibly move the employee against their will, unless an arrest has been performed, including a Miranda warning. The Sixth amendment requires that the employee must be told about the reason when moved against their will or detained against their will. Rules vary by state, but employees are usually entitled to a 15-minute paid break every two hours and an unpaid meal hour after every four. In most states, employees are entitled to overtime for any missed break periods, and state labor protection rules extend to federal workers. One of the benefits of union representation is Weingarten rightshttp://clear.uhwo.hawaii.edu/wein.html to reduce employer abuse. Employees not represented by a union may have limited Weingartern rights, and may not be entitled to witnesses during a meeting. The employee and the union representative have the right to management information related to the dispute and both the employee and the union representative may take an active role during any meetings. Weingarten rights are as follows: * Employee has the right to union representation during discussion requested by management * Employee must ask a manager if the discussion may involve disciplinary action * Employee must ask the union steward to attend the discussion * Employee must inform employer that union representation has been requested * If employer refuses union representation: # State \\"If this discussion could in any way result in my being disciplined or terminated then I respectfully request union representation. I choose to not respond to questions or statements without union representation.\\" # Take notes, do not answer questions, do not sign documents, and inform union after discussion * Employee has the right to speak privately with union representation before the discussion and during the discussion * The union representative is an active participant. He or she is not just a passive witness. Government employees also have Garrity rights to assert Fifth Amendment protection related to employment that is completely different from Miranda rights that apply to employees working for private companies. One issue with public employees is that certain workplace situations violate public law. Government employees who deviate from office procedures may violate laws, such as the New Jersey ticket fixing scandal and the Minnesota ticket fixing scandal.http://www.tmcec.com/resources/more- resources/ticket_fixing/ Employees who carry pesticide into the workplace from home violate the Hazard Communication Standard. Managers may threaten to take disciplinary employment action if an employee fails to disclose criminal activity. Government employees also have Garrity rights, and must assert the following when questioned by management. This must be separate from any report or statement from management if made in writing. * \\"On ____________‚Äî (date) _________‚Äî (time), at ____________‚Äî (place) I was ordered by _________________‚Äî (superior officer, name & rank) to submit this report (statement) as a condition of continued employment. In view of possible job forfeiture, I have no alternative, but to abide by this order and to submit this compelled report (statement). * It is my belief and understanding that this report (statement) will not and cannot be used against me by any governmental agency or related entity in any subsequent proceedings, other than disciplinary proceedings within the confines of the department itself. * For any and all other purposes, I hereby assert my constitutional right to remain silent under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and any other rights prescribed by (state) laws. Further, I rely specifically upon the protection afforded me under the doctrines set forth in Garrity v New Jersey, 385 US 493 (1967), Gardner v Broderick, 392 US 273 (1968), and their progeny, should this report (statement) be used for any other purpose of whatsoever kind or description.\\" * The employer shall not order or otherwise compel a public employee, under threat of discipline, to waive the immunity of the asserted Fifth Amendment privilege against self- incrimination with respect to any submitted statement or report or answers to questions. (Employees shall not condition their compliance with a lawful order to submit reports, statements, etc. on non-disclosure to third parties by the employer.) * Propriety of the discipline shall be determined through the collective bargaining agreement grievance arbitration process. Exemptions and limitations to whistleblower protections There are certain limitations and exemptions to the legal protections for whistleblowers in the U.S. With regard to federal legislation, the broadest law is the Whistleblower Protection Act. However, its protections apply only to federal employees. Both public and private employees may be protected under topic-specific federal laws, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but such laws cover only a narrow, specific area of unlawful activity. Private sector employees are not protected by federal whistleblower protection statutes if they report either violations of federal laws with no whistleblower protection provisions or violations of state laws, although they may have some protection under local laws. In 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report stating that employees who reported illegal activities did not receive enough protection from retaliation by their employers. Based on data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, only 21% of the 1800 whistleblower cases reviewed by the agency in 2007 had \\"a favorable outcome\\" for the whistleblower. The GAO found that the key issues were lack of resources for investigating employees' claims and the legal complexity of whistleblower protection regulations. In the United States, union officials are exempted from whistleblower laws. There are currently no legal protections for employees of labor unions who report union corruption, and such employees can be dismissed from employment should they raise any allegations of financial impropriety. The Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, which legislates against union corruption, includes protections for whistleblowers, however the Supreme Court has ruled that these protections apply only to union members and not to employees of labor unions.

The ability of transplanted progenitor cells to improve function within the failing heart has been shown in experimental animal models and in some human clinical trials. In November 2011, a large group of collaborators at Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation at Abbott Northwestern found no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or other markers, between a group of patients treated with cellular cardiomyoplasty and a group of control patients. In this study, all patients were post MI, post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and that infusion of progenitor cells occurred 2‚Äì3 weeks after intervention. In a study that is currently underway (February 2012), however, more positive results were being reported: In the SCIPIO trial, patients treated with autologous cardiac stem cells post MI have been reported to be showing statistically significant increases in LVEF and reduction in infarct size over the control group at four months after implant. Positive results at the one-year mark are even more pronounced. Yet the SCIPIO trial \\"was recently called into question\\". Harvard University is \\"now investigating the integrity of some of the data\\". The Lancet recently published a non-specific ‚ÄòExpression of concern‚Äô about the paper. Subsequently, another preclinical study also raised doubts on the rationale behind using this special kind of cell, as it was found that the special cells only have a minimal ability in generating new cardiomyocytes. Some specialists therefore now raise concerns to continue. __TOC__ Progenitor cell lines To date, the ideal progenitor cells have not been found or created. With the goal of recreating human tissue, the use of embryonic stem cells (ESC) was the initial logical choice. These pluripotent cells can conceptually give rise to any somatic cell line in the human body and while animal studies have shown restoration of cardiac function, immunologic rejection issues and teratoma formation have rendered ESC's a high risk. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a cell line derived from somatic cells which have been induced through a combination of transcription factors. The iPSC line is very similar or identical to ESCs in many regards and also shows great promise in cardiac potential. This cell line, however, is also less than ideal in that this cell type has been unable to mature into a homogeneous cell culture, making it immunogenic and teratogenic. A third cell line that shows great promise and has no known safety concerns is the adult stem cell derived from bone marrow or from cardiac tissue explants. It has been shown in several studies that adult stem cells do have cardiogenic potential. Future direction Presently, the success of adult stem cells in regenerating human myocardium is just a fraction of what it could be. Three major challenges have been observed. Adult stem cells exhibit a minimal commitment to engraft into the damaged myocardium, they have low survival rates and they have limited proliferation. The positive effects observed in clinical trials today are a result of the work of donated stem cells that persist in the damaged myocardium for just days to weeks after delivery. Clearly, if cell survival is prolonged, these effects could be greatly enhanced. This is where a majority of research is being done today and several methodologies hold great promise.

Directly before coming to Chicago, Brizard served as the superintendent of the Rochester City School District. Brizard is best known as an education reformer, a strong charter school advocate and a champion of labor reform, particularly in regards to limiting teacher tenure status. Brizard started his career as a teacher, then an administrator, in the New York School System. He now works part time as a consultant for education reform organizations in America but primarily focuses on raising his children. Biography Brizard was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Dictator Fran√ßois Duvalier had his grandfather imprisoned and his parents fled to the United States when it was learned his father might be imprisoned as well. After reuniting with his family, Brizard attended public schools in Brooklyn and earned a bachelor's degree in Chemistry and a master's degree in Science Education from Queens College and a master's degree in School Administration and Supervision from the City College of New York. He began his career as an instructor at Rikers Island, later moving to George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, where he taught physics and became principal in 1999. In 2003 he rose to the instructional superintendency of Region 8, New York City Department of Education. He attended the Superintendents‚Äô Academy of the Broad Center for the Management of School Systems in 2007. In 2008, he assumed the superintendency of the Rochester City School District. In Rochester, he promoted charter schools and merit pay, pushed for performance standards, and met with so much opposition from the teachers‚Äô union that they gave him a vote of no confidence before he left for Chicago.In Chicago, It‚Äôs a Mess, All Right By JOE NOCERA, New York Times, September 10, 2012 =Chicago Public Schools= Brizard was hired by Rahm Emanuel and became the CEO of Chicago Public Schools on May 16, 2011. He stepped down after 17 months on October 11, 2012. In a written response Brizard stated he and the Mayor had come to a \\"mutual agreement\\" that he was a \\"distraction\\" to school reform.Chicago Public Schools CEO Jean-Claude Brizard out by ‚Äòmutual agreement‚Äô Rumors of Brizard's resignation were first reported by several news organizations on August 31, 2012 but were denied by Mayor Emanuel directly. The possibility of an impending resignation first surfaced in July 2012, when portions of Brizard's personnel evaluation were leaked to the press. The leaks raised concerns about his ability to manage such a large organization as CPS and turnover of his leadership team. In August 2012, the Chicago Teachers Union went on strike for the first time in more than 25 years. The policies of Brizard and Mayor Emanuel were cited as the impetus for the strike. As part of his resignation package, Brizard received a year's salary at $250,000 along with other undisclosed benefits.

It was formed on 1 July 1979 to provide ground defence of the station. Tasked with preventing Soviet Special Forces from disrupting flying operations, personnel were recruited from across East Anglia and formed an integral part of the station's war-fighting capability for the next 15 years. Throughout this period, the squadron participated in many exercises and held annual camps in the United Kingdom, Germany and Gibraltar, winning the Strickland Trophy competition in 1991. History GPMG on rangethumb The squadron disbanded as a field squadron on 18 April 1994, reforming on 1 June 1995 as a training unit, providing centralised training to the Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment field Squadrons, resulting in the word \\"Training\\" being added to the squadron's title to reflect the new role. This role was later subsumed into Training Wing at Royal Air Force Honington and the squadron subsequently switched roles again. The Strategic Defence Review in the mid -1990s had identified the need to provide sustainment of the Royal Air Force's Ground Based Air Defence Force. As a result, the squadron resumed its original title and took on a new role in October 1998 with a mix of regulars and auxiliaries operating the highly sophisticated Rapier Field Standard C missile system, being declared operational in its new role in April 2001. In May 2003, many of the squadron's personnel were mobilised and deployed to the Falkland Islands to augment No. 16 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment as the Resident Rapier Squadron, providing the ground based air defence of the Mount Pleasant Complex from July 2003 to January 2004. Ground based air defence passed to the Royal Artillery in entirety following the 2004 Defence Review, but under Royal Air Force command. At the same time, a need for the squadron to provide a new capability was also highlighted, resulting in the squadron taking on a new role once again to provide a key component of the Joint Nuclear Biological and Chemical Regiment's operational output from March 2004. Deploying to Canada in 2005 and then Cyprus in 2006, the squadron won the Inspector's Cup for Excellence in 2007 and Kemp Dirk for recruiting during 2008. In June 2008, No.8 Force Protection Wing was stood up to undertake a single operational tour at Kandahar Airfield within Operation HERRICK. The Wing comprised Headquarter elements from Royal Air Force Henlow, together with No. 27 Squadron RAF Regiment and No. 2623 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment and resulted in a temporary change to a purely Dismounted Close Combat role for both squadrons. The Wing deployed to Kandahar Airfield from August 2009 to February 2010 and a large number of reservist personnel from 2623 Squadron were mobilised, serving within both 27 Squadron and the Wing Headquarters itself. On completion of the operational tour, both squadrons returned to their previous role. The squadron was presented with its Standard to commemorate 25 years service by Queen Elizabeth II at a unique ceremony held at Royal Air Force Marham on 18 July 2010. Since the disbanding of the Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, the squadron has supported 26 and 27 Sqns RAF Regiment in their role forming the RAF's Defence CBRN Wing. =The squadron badge= The Standard features the squadron badge, which was awarded in 1988. The badge demonstrates the squadron's links with East Anglia, with the wolf salient representing the 'Wolfmen' - the Danes who ravages and then settled in East Anglia during the Dark Ages. The crossed arrows represent the martydom of St Edmund and allude to the squadron's association with the local town of Bury St Edmunds. The motto 'Gebeorgan Ond Werian' is Anglo-Saxon, and can be loosely translated as Protect and Defend.

It was abolished on 17 February 1925 in Turkey the successor of the Ottoman Empire. Much of the Ottoman empire's tax system was inherited from earlier practices in each territory that it conquered. Muqasama had been common practice in the Mamluk empire, and much of the Middle East, even before the spread of Islam; a similar system had been used in Sassanid Persia. Muqasama was a tax directly applied to agricultural output, taking a proportion which varied between areas and between producers. These discriminatory rates caused inefficiencies; as farmers reacted to locally varying taxes on different farm products, this increased variations in agricultural output between areas, or even between villages. Farms subject to the highest taxes switched to alternative crops. Under Ottoman rule, muqasama became known as Ashar. The name means \\"a tenth\\", although the exact proportion might vary - and it was a tithe taken from all agricultural produce. Ashar was an important source of revenue in the early Ottoman empire, as it had been for the Abbasids. Ashar was typically paid annually, to the timar holder. early forms of √∂≈ü√ºr were enforced in transit, with watchtowers on transport routes, and checkpoints at bottleneck locations such as bridges and passes. One preserved tax-code document from Mosul in the 1540s specifies √∂≈ü√ºr shares ranging from one fifth to one sixth to a tenth, depending on the crop - more lucrative crops were subject to a larger tithe. There was very wide variation between different regions, and the tithe was extended to cotton, fish, honey, and silk as well as the usual fruit and vegetables. Ashar was primarily collected in the Ottoman Empire's Middle Eastern territories; different tax structures were inherited in other parts of the empire, particularly in Europe. Taxation evolved over time, moving from tithes and other taxes-in-kind towards a more centralised system of taxation in cash; hence √∂≈ü√ºr was mostly superseded by taxes like avariz. However, a later form of tithe on farming, called, asar, was reintroduced during the tanzimat reforms.

Complaints that the coalition casualties were avoidable and caused by a failure of the chain of command to provide fire support for the team triggered an official investigation and a series of reprimands to several US military officers. Army Captain William D. Swenson and Marine Corporal Dakota Meyer received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle. Meyer is the first living Marine to receive the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War, and Swenson is the fifth living soldier and second officer to receive the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War. Two other Marines at the battle, Staff Sgt. Juan Rodriguez-Chavez and Capt. Ademola Fabayo, received the Navy Cross. Background On September 3 an Embedded Training Team (ETT) led a combined group of Afghan Army and National Police forces on a patrol operation around Dam Dara, a village about a mile from Ganjgal. The villagers reacted cordially but the ETT and its Afghan allies took small arms fire upon leaving Dam Dara from a small group of men on a ridge outside the village. After the brief attack the village elders of nearby Ganjgal renounced the attackers and requested that the coalition forces return to their village to conduct a census of military age males and assist in the rebuilding of the local mosque. The original date of September 7 was pushed back by the ETT at the last minute in order to ensure that their National Police forces were adequately prepared for the coming operation. Engagement The following day, on September 8, an alternate Training Team, ETT 2-8, set out with their allied Afghan forces to Ganjgal. During their mission planning, it was made clear that no dedicated close air support would be available for the mission but commanders promised artillery support from nearby forward bases. In addition, ETT 2-8 was told that, in case of emergency, helicopter support could be redirected from an operation in a neighboring valley within five minutes. Initial intelligence available to the team indicated that Taliban forces were aware of the pending mission and were setting up ambush positions within the village with a forward force of at least 20 fighters. Concerned with both losing the initiative and the safety of the anti-Taliban village elders, ETT 2-8 decided to proceed with the mission and engage the Taliban forces. Just after dawn, after inserting into the valley and approaching Ganjgal, the Task Force came under heavy machine gun, small arms and RPG fire from at least 100 entrenched Taliban fighters, far more than were indicated present by intelligence reports. The Task Force soon found itself pinned down in a three-sided ambush and taunted over open radio channels by Taliban fighters. Initial calls for artillery support were rejected by the command post due to new rules of engagement put in place by the commander of the International Security Assistance Force, General Stanley McChrystal, in an effort to reduce civilian casualties. Both an Army artillery NCO and an Air Force JTAC took immediate action to provide the ambushed US/Afghan unit with fire support, but they were overruled by the command post. ETT 2-8 informed their command post that they were not near the village but were again denied fire support. ETT 2-8 began calls for emergency helicopter support but the adjacent helicopter assets were tied up and taking fire in support of another operation. The coalition forces were taking increasing fire and could observe women and children shuttling fresh ammunition to Taliban fighting positions. Within 30 minutes of making contact, the ETT ordered back to the command post to provide an artillery barrage of smoke canisters to cover their withdrawal. Told that no standard smoke was available, the team requested white phosphorus rounds be used instead to screen their retreat. Nearly an hour later, the white phosphorus rounds landed and the coalition forces retreated under heavy fire a short distance before being pinned once again. By this time, three U.S. Marines, their Navy corpsman, their Afghan interpreter and several Afghan soldiers had been killed, and an Army soldier in the ETT had sustained mortal wounds. Taliban snipers were moving into flanking positions when helicopter support arrived and began to attack Taliban positions. This arrival allowed the wounded to be pulled out and for three Marines to fight their way back up the hill to retrieve fallen comrades. By the time Task Force Chosin had totally disengaged, the firefight had lasted for nearly nine hours. The position occupied by the three dead Marines and the Navy corpsman had been overrun by the enemy, who stripped the bodies of their gear and weapons. The bodies were recovered after their comrades (including Medal of Honor recipients Dakota Meyer and William D. Swenson) braved enemy fire to return to the location. Aftermath After the battle, coalition forces speculated that elements within the Afghan National Police forces and local villagers had informed nearby Taliban forces of the mission's timing and location. In addition, an investigation was launched into the lack of requested fire and air support. While members of the task force publicly blamed McChrystal's new rules of engagement, which were also cited by personnel at the command post, the investigation placed most blame on the battalion leadership concluding it had been \\"negligent\\". The investigation found that three US Army officers at nearby Forward Operating Base Joyce, from Task Force Chosin, a unit comprising soldiers from 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, out of Fort Drum, New York, had exhibited \\"negligent leadership\\" which had directly contributed to the loss of life in the battle. Two of the three officers, Major Peter Granger and Captain Aaron Harting, were given formal reprimands.Lamothe, Dan, \\"Into the Fire\\", Military Times, 20 August 2012, p. 20 In September 2012, a McClatchy journalist interviewed nine Afghan soldiers from the Afghan National Army's 1st Kandak, 2nd Infantry Brigade, 201st Corps who had been present at the battle. The Afghan soldiers disputed portions of the US Marine Corps's account of the battle, stating that the Taliban did not charge Meyer's vehicle and that only two dead Taliban were found after the battle. The Afghan soldiers stated that it was the belated arrival of attack helicopters which finally chased away the Taliban, not the actions of any of the U.S. soldiers or Marines on the ground. The Afghans added that the three Marines and naval corpsman, 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, Gunnery Sgt. Edwin W. Johnson, and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class James Layton, were killed after remaining behind to cover the withdrawal of the Afghan soldiers from the ambush site.Landay, Jonathan S., \\"Afghan survivors of Ganjgal battle dispute official account of Medal of Honor feats\\", McClatchy News Service, 13 September 2012Afghan soldiers recount 4 U.S. troops‚Äô heroic deaths at Ganjgal Several members of ETT 2-8 were cited for valor with several Bronze Stars and a single Medal of Honor was awarded to Meyer.

A 2012 investigation by McClatchy News Service concluded that the justification for Meyer's decoration may have been inflated and that the nomination for Swenson's Medal of Honor may have been intentionally lost.Landay, Jonathan S., \\"Questions Surround Medal Of Honor File\\", The News Tribune, (McClatchy News Service), 7 August 2012 Meyer disputes McClatchy's allegations in his book, Into the Fire: A Firsthand Account of the Most Extraordinary Battle in the Afghan War. In August 2012, California Representative Duncan D. Hunter wrote to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta regarding the Medal of Honor nomination of Swenson, comparing his case to that of Sgt. Rafael Peralta. In January 2013, Representative Hunter said Swenson's nomination had been awaiting President Barack Obama's approval at the White House since at least July 2012. Representative Hunter stated he was considering seeking an inspector general inquiry due to the delay. Swenson was awarded the Medal of Honor on October 15, 2013.

It supports the principles of a liberal, democratic, and secular political order in Egypt. The Free Egyptians Party is the largest party in the House of Representatives. History =Establishment= On 3 April 2011, the engineer and businessman Naguib Sawiris, and a group of intellectuals and political activists announced the establishment of the party and declared the program, the objectives and the basic principles of the party. Other prominent party members include the Egyptian American scientist Farouk El-Baz, the Egyptian Arabic poet Ahmed Fouad Negm, the writer Gamal El- Ghitani, and the telecommunications entrepreneur Khaled Bichara. In July 2011, infighting emerged within the party. An internal faction called the \\"Group of 17\\" accused the national leadership of undemocratic methods in choosing local leaders in the Damietta Governorate and of tolerating former members of the National Democratic Party, the ruling party of the toppled Mubarak regime, within the ranks of the Free Egyptians Party. Five of the dissidents have been excluded from the party, and have been denoted as \\"troublemakers\\" by party officials. Nevertheless, in August of the same year, the new party reported to have 100,000 members. =Egyptian Bloc and elections of 2011/2012= The Free Egyptians Party was an integral component of the Egyptian Bloc, a broad electoral alliance opposing the Muslim Brotherhood, founded on 16 August 2011. The Egyptian Bloc has taken up the cause of defending Egypt's secularity and civic society. However, until the first post-revolutionary parliamentary elections, held in November 2011 and January 2012, several member parties left the Egyptian Bloc, complaining that it included \\"remnants of the former regime\\". So, at the time of the election the Bloc only included the Free Egyptians Party, the Egyptian Social Democratic Party (ESDP), and Tagammu. Together, the Bloc won 2,402,238 votes, corresponding to a share of 8.9%. Of the 332 seats allocated to parties and coalitions, 33 were taken by candidates of the Egyptian Bloc, 14 of which were members of the Free Egyptians Party. One FEP member was elected to one of the 166 seats reserved for individual candidates. Unlike its partners ESDP and Tagammu, the Free Egyptians Party decided to boycott the Shura council elections in January and February 2012, citing the reluctance of authorities to address irregularities during the lower house elections. After the elections, the Egyptian Bloc collapsed with the ESDP retiring, claiming that the other partners were more concerned over the secular-Islamist divide than over the differences between the former regime and the forces of the revolution. In March 2012, former deputy chairman and member of parliament Mohamed Abu Hamed resigned from the party to become a leader of the Life of the Egyptians Party and later of the Egyptian Patriotic Movement. =Opposition against the Islamist government= The Free Egyptians did not take part in the selection of members of the Constituent Assembly in June 2012, lamenting an over-representation of Islamists in it. It confirmed its calls to boycott the assembly in September 2012. Instead, the FEP participated in a number of projects trying to coordinate the secular opposition against the Islamist majority that came out of the election, namely the Egyptian Nation Alliance that was announced in September 2012, the Civil Democratic Movement of October 2012, and the National Salvation Front founded in November 2012. The FEP called for a boycott of the constitutional referendum in December 2012 to demonstrate their rejection of the entire process that led to the Islamist-sponsored 2012 constitution. =After 2013 protests= The Free Egyptians Party supported the ouster of President Mohamed Morsi, which followed anti-government protests against him. The party regarded the protests leading up to Morsi's removal as a revolution and did not regard his overthrow as a coup. In December 2013, the older liberal Democratic Front Party merged into the Free Egyptians Party. In the same month, it was reported that the Free Egyptians Party had become part of the National Front Coalition, but in February 2014 the party clarified that it would not make sense to join an electoral alliance before the electoral law was even passed. The Free Egyptians supported the 2014 Egyptian constitution that was up for vote during the January 2014 constitutional referendum, which it passed with 98.1% (while the turnout was 38.6%). In April 2014, the Free Egyptians Party was admitted as a full member to the Liberal International, as it had previously already been an observer member and member of the regional Arab Alliance for Freedom and Democracy. The party declared its support for candidate Abdel Fattah el- Sisi in the May 2014 presidential election. =President= After the party's establishment, a presidential office was established to act as president of the party until internal elections.. After the parliamentary elections of November 2011 and January 2012, Ahmed Said was appointed as interim president of the party and Rawi Camel-Touge as interim Secretary General. After holding the first congress of the party on 10 May 2013 Ahmed Said was elected as the first elected president of the Free Egyptians Party. After the merger of the Democratic Front Party into the Free Egyptians Party, at the first Supreme Council meeting on 28 April 2014 Essam Khalil was elected to be General Secretary. in December 2015, Free Egyptians Party elected his leader Essam Khalil with 84% of votes to be the second elected president. =Political bureau= The first elected Political Bureau of the Free Egyptians Party: * Essam Khalil - Party Leader * Nader El Sharkawy; (Acting Secretary General) * Alaa Abed - Parliamentary Bloc Chief * Belal Habash * Shehab Wagieh * Mona Gab Allah * Ahmed Saif - Managing Director * Manal Abdel-Hamid * Nassr El Kafas * Amir Youssef =Board of Trustees= Board of trustees was approved in the first congress of the party * Salah Fadel - Chairman * Naguib Sawiris * Mohammed Salmawy * Farouk El-Baz * Yehia El-Gamal * Sakina Fouad * Nadim Elias * Ragy Soliman * Mahmoud Al Alily Internal Crisis In 2016, the Free Egyptians Party underwent a major internal crisis that led to the division of the party into two opposing factions; one led by Party Leader Essam Khalil, and the other led by Party founder Naguib Sawiris. =Buildup= Essam Khalil saw Sawiris and the Board as being too domineering over party affairs, and that the only way to effectively lead what was now the biggest political party in Egypt would be to remove the board and transfer the executive and legislative roles of the board to the Political Bureau. Furthermore, Khalil was angered by Sawiris' constant interference in party affairs and his criticism of the party's continued support for the government. Sawiris also called for disciplinary action against several party members, for voting in favour of actions he deemed wrong, such as the attack on the influential Egyptian writer and media personality Ibrahim Eissa. The majority of said parliamentarians were close friends of Khalil's, which caused further tension between the two. It has also been reported that Sawiris had cut off funding towards the party for 6‚Äì7 months in protest of its policies. Sawiris wanted the party to serve as an opposition figure to the government, whereas it seemed Khalil was just supporting everything the government did. =Division= The dispute began when Khalil called for a vote to dissolve the Board of Trustees of the party at the Annual Party Conference. Khalil emphasised that the party was too big for a Board of Trustees, and that the system of management of the party was too inefficient. He asserted that there are only two other parties in the world with a Board of Trustees, one in Iran, and the other being the Muslim Brotherhood. However, according to the party's own bylaws, any decision concerning the governance of the party must be approved of by the Board of Trustees. Thus a stalemate was reached, wherein Khalil took control of the party as though the Board had approved the new proposals, whilst Sawiris stood firm in his stance against the move, deeming it to be illegal, and continues to exercise great influence on the party. =Aftermath= Little has changed in the party's situation since 2016. Sawiris has since filed a lawsuit in Egypt against Essam Khalil for violation of the party's internal bylaws. However, due to the inactivity of the party, especially in the face of the growing influence of the Wafd Party and the explosive rise of the Future of the Nation Party, the Free Egyptians Party is no longer seen as the political force it once was, and is widely expected to lose many seats in the next parliamentary elections.

The Almohad reforms were a series of attempted radical changes to Islamic religious and social doctrine under the Almohad movement, founded by Ibn Tumart, which created the Almohad Empire during the 12th to 13th centuries. Under Almohad rule this religious doctrine affected large parts of the Maghreb and altered the existing religious climate in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain and Portugal) for many decades.Pascal Buresi and Hicham El Aallaoui, Governing the Empire: Provincial Administration in the Almohad Caliphate 1224-1269, pg. 170. Volume 3 of Studies in the History and Society of the Maghrib. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2012. Dominique Urvoy, The Ulama of al-Andalus, pg. 868. Taken from The Legacy of Muslim Spain, Volume 12 of Handbook of Oriental Studies : The Near and Middle East. Eds. Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Manuela Mar√≠n. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1992. This marked a major departure from the social policies and attitudes of earlier Muslim governments in the region, including the preceding Almoravid dynasty which had followed its own reformist agenda. The religious fundamentalism of the Almohad Caliphate caused a massive emigration of Jews and Christians from southern Iberia to the Christian north and North Africa, specifically Egypt. Origins =Religious climate before Almohads= During its golden age, Spain was open to a good deal of religious tolerance. For the most part the Almoravids let other People of the Book, or other religions that held the Old Testament as a holy text, practice their religion freely.Allen Fromherz, \\"North Africa and the Twelfth-century Renaissance: Christian Europe and the Almohad Islamic Empire\\", Islam & Christian-Muslim Relations 20, no. 1 (January 2009): 43-59. The Almoravids, however, were more puritanical than previous Muslim rulers of Spain. The golden age for Jews in Spain is considered to be under the relative tolerant rule of the Ummayyad Caliphate in al-Andalus. It was generally a time when Jews were free to conduct business, participate in government, and practice their religion without fear of persecution. =Rise to power= Map showing the area of Almohad control in Spain and the paths of counter-attacks from Castile (C) and Arag√≥n (A). ((L) Leon, (P) Portugal, (N) Navarre) Like the Almoravids, the Almohads crossed over into Spain from North Africa. They were led by ibn Tumart, regarded by historians as a fundamentalist who was convinced that it was his destiny to reform Islam. Ibn Tumart claimed to be the mahdi, a title which elevated him to something similar to a messiah or leader of a redemption of righteous Islamic order. He was an intelligent and charismatic man; he claimed to be a direct descendant of Muhammad. He had studied in Alexandria, C√≥rdoba, Mecca, and Baghdad, and his fanaticism and charismatic preaching earned him a devoted group of followers. He presented a different view that caused outright hostility on the Iberian peninsula.Madeleine Fletcher, \\"The Almohad Tawhƒ´d: Theology Which Relies on Logic\\", Numen, v. 38, no. 1 (June 1, 1991): 110-127 To top off the Almohads' meteoric rise, in 1146 they crossed over the Strait of Gibraltar into Iberia.Amira Bennison, \\"The Almohads and the Qur'ƒÅn of Uthm ƒÅn: The Legacy of the Umayyads of Cordoba in the Twelfth Century Maghrib\\", Al- Masaq: Islam & the Medieval Mediterranean 19, no. 2 (2007): 131-154. Their rule quickly spread across a new continent. At their height they were one of the most powerful forces in the western Mediterranean. Once they took control over the Iberian Peninsula, they cemented their presence by moving their capital from the high Atlas village of Tinmel to the Spanish city of Seville. They were a determined military and economic force, defeating Christian forces primarily composed of Castilians at the Battle of Alarcos.J. F. Powers, \\"The Early Reconquest Episcopate at Cuenca, 1177‚Äì1284\\", The Catholic Historical Review, v. 87, no. 1 (2001): 1-16. This marked the height of the Almohad Caliphate. Ibn Tumart himself died in 1130, well before the Almohads' main military successes, and had no spiritual successor. However, the political leadership of his movement passed on to Abd al-Mu'min, who effectively founded the Almohad ruling dynasty. He and his successors had very different personalities from Ibn Tumart but nonetheless pursued his reforms, culminating in a particularly aggressive push by Ya'qub al-Mansur (who arguably ruled at the apogee of Almohad power). Religious doctrine and ideology The Almohad ideology preached by Ibn Tumart is described by Amira Bennison as a \\"sophisticated hybrid form of Islam that wove together strands from Hadith science, Zahiri and Shafi'i fiqh, Ghazalian social actions (hisba), and spiritual engagement with Shi'i notions of the imam and mahdi\\". This contrasted with the highly orthodox or traditionalist Maliki school (maddhab) of Sunni Islam which predominated in the region up to that point. Central to his philosophy, Ibn Tumart preached a fundamentalist or radical version of tawhid ‚Äì referring to a strict monotheism or to the \\"oneness of God\\". This notion gave the movement its name: al-Muwa·∏•·∏•id≈´n (), meaning roughly \\"those who advocate tawhid\\", which was adapted to \\"Almohads\\" in European writings. Ibn Tumart saw his movement as a revolutionary reform movement much as early Islam saw itself relative to the Christianity and Judaism which preceded it, with himself as its mahdi and leader. The Almohad judicial system has been described as looking to the letter of the law rather than the deeper intended purpose of the law. They primarily followed the Zahirite school of law within Sunni Islam; under the reign of Abu Yaqub Yusuf, chief judge Ibn Ma·∏çƒÅ æ oversaw the banning of any religious material written by non-Zahirites.Kees Versteegh, The Arabic Linguistic Tradition, pg. 142. Part of Landmarks in Linguistic Thought series, vol. 3. New York: Routledge, 1997. Abu Yaqub's son Abu Yusuf went even further, actually burning non-Zahirite religious works instead of merely banning them.Shawqi Daif, Introduction to Ibn Mada's Refutation of the Grammarians, pg. 6. Cairo, 1947. They trained new judges, who were given schooling in both the religious and military arts. They had a very traditional philosophy, one which did not look to any of the reforms past caliphates had attempted to institute. Where the preceding Almoravids considered themselves an empire, the Almohads sought to return Spain to the days of the Caliphate.Maribel Fierro, \\"Alfonso X 'The Wise': The Last Almohad Caliph?\\", Medieval Encounters 15, no. 2-4 (December 2009): 175-198. Treatment of non- Muslims At their peak in the 1170s, the Almohads had firm control over most of Islamic Spain, and were not threatened by the Christian forces to the north. Once the Almohads took control of southern Spain and Portugal, they introduced a number of very strict religious laws. Even before they took complete control in the 1170s, they had begun removing non Muslims from positions of power.Norman Roth, \\"The Jews and the Muslim Conquest of Spain\\", Jewish Social Studies 38, no. 2 (Spring 1976): 145-158. Jews and Christians were denied freedom of religion, with many sources relating that the Almohads rejected the very concept of dhimmi (the official protected but subordinate status of Jews and Christians under Islamic rule) and insisted that all people should accept Ibn Tumart as mahdi. During his siege against the Normans in Mahdia, Abd al-Mu'min infamously declared that Christians and Jews must choose between conversion or death. Likewise, the Almohads officially regarded all non-Almohads, including non-Almohad Muslims, as false monotheists and in multiple cases massacred or punished the entire population of a town, both Muslim and non-Muslim, for defying them. Generally, however, the enforcement of this ideological position varied greatly from place to place and appears to have been especially tied to whether or not local communities resisted the Almohad armies as they advanced. However, as the Almohads were on a self- declared jihad, they were willing to use brutal techniques to back up their holy war.Maribel Fierro, \\"Decapitation of Christians and Muslims in the Medieval Iberian Peninsula: Narratives, Images, Contemporary Perceptions\\", Comparative Literature Studies, v. 45, no. 2 (2008): 137-164. In some cases the threats of violence were carried out locally as a warning to others even if the authorities did not have the ability to actually follow through on a larger scale. Native Christians in al-Andalus who were living under Muslim rule up until this point had the option to escape to Christian-controlled lands to the north, and many did so. Alfonso VII of Leon and Castile also encouraged them to flee by offering them lands if they migrated to his territory. Jews, however, were particularly vulnerable as they faced an uncertain minority status in both Christian or Muslim territory, as well as because they lived mainly in urban areas where they were especially visible to authorities. Many were killed in the course of Almohad invasions or repressions. This pressure to convert resulted in many conversions under duress which were insincere, with many Christians and Jews officially converting in order to escape violence while preserving their livelihoods. Even the famous Jewish philosopher Maimonides was reported to have officially converted to Islam under Almohad rule when he moved from Cordoba to Fes, before finally leaving for Egypt where he was able to live openly as a Jew again. Half-hearted oaths were certainly not looked to as ideal and brought a lot of problems for the population of al-Andalus, much as it did during the forced conversion of Muslims and Jews in Spain and Portugal a few centuries later. The Almohads recognized that many of the conversions by Jews were not particularly sincere, which certainly did not help to promote social and religious unity. They responded to this by imposing severe regulations on the business of former Jews. Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur set up a strict dress code for Jews living within Almohad territory: Jews had to wear dark blue or black, the traditional colors of mourning in Islam, which further entrenched discrimination.Comparative Literature Studies, \\"The Decline of the Almohads: Reflections on the Viability of Religious Movements\\", History of Religions, v. 4, no. 1 (July 1, 1964): 23-29. Decline The monument constructed on the site of the alt=In al-Andalus the Almohad caliphate was decisively defeated by the combined Christian forces of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, in 1212.Isabel O‚ÄôConnor, \\"The Fall of the Almohad Empire in the Eyes of Modern Spanish Historians\\", Islam & Christian-Muslim Relations 14, no. 2 (April 2003): 145 The battle is recognized as one of the most important events in the reconquista movement in Spain. Not only was it a decisive defeat of the Muslim forces, it was also one of the first times the fractured Christian kingdoms of the north came together for the common goal of reclaiming the peninsula. Following 1212 the Almohad Caliphate's power declined and the revolutionary religious dogmatism of Ibn Tumart began to fade as later Almohad dynastic rulers were more preoccupied with the practicalities of maintaining the empire over a wide region whose population largely did not subscribe to Almohadism. This culminated in 1229 when Caliph al-Ma'mun publicly repudiated Ibn Tumart's status as mahdi. This declaration may have been an attempt to appease the Muslim population of al-Andalus, but it also allowed for one Almohad faction, the Hafsids, to disavow his leadership and declare the eastern part of the empire in Ifriqiya (Tunisia) to be independent, thus founding the Hafsid state. By 1270, the Almohads were no longer a force of any significance on the Iberian Peninsula or Morocco. After their fall, the fundamentalist religious doctrine that they supported was relaxed once again. Some scholars consider that Ibn Tumart's overall ideological mission ultimately failed, but that, like the Almoravids, his movement nonetheless played a role in the history of Islamization in the region. One holdover for Jews was a law that stated that people who converted to Islam would be put to death if they reconverted.Amira Bennison, \\"The Almohads and the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn of Uthm ƒÅn: The Legacy of the Umayyads of Cordoba in the Twelfth Century Maghrib\\", Al-Masaq: Islam & the Medieval Mediterranean 19, no. 2 (2007): 131-154. The Hafsids of Tunisia, in turn, officially declared themselves the true \\"Almohads\\" after their independence from Marrakesh but this identity and ideology lessened in importance over time. The early Hafsid leadership mainly attempted to keep the Almohads as a political elite more than a religious elite in a region that was otherwise predominantly Maliki Sunni in orientation. Eventually, the Almohads were merely one among multiple factions competing for power in their state. After 1311, when Sultan al- Lihyani took power with Aragonese help, Ibn Tumart's name was dropped from the khutba (the main community sermon on Fridays), effectively signaling the end of public support for Almohad doctrine. Over the 14th century the Maliki ulama (scholars) increasingly occupied positions in the state and were the de facto religious authorities.

Temettu was a tax on estimated (or presumed) business profits; it was mostly paid by merchants and artisans. An early form of temettu was attempted in 1839 (following a firman of 1838 which announced sweeping tax reforms), but it was impractical without detailed information on business incomes. A comprehensive approach to taxation of business profits in the Ottoman empire - rather than the traditional method of taxing specific outputs or assets - only really became possible after a thorough cadastral survey carried out in 1858-1860, which collected detailed information on the status of businesses throughout the empire. Immediately after this, a new temettu was set at 3%; in 1878 it was raised to 4% of estimated profit. In 1886 the temettu was increased to 5%, and it was also applied to wages and salaries; for most of the Ottoman empire, this was the first real income tax, in the modern sense. Temettu was paid annually; it was a graduated tax, with the rich liable to pay considerably more than the poor. By 1910, temettu revenue had reached 1 million livres per year; the same as tobacco and petrol duties, and less than the revenue from customs. Farmers who did not participate in commerce were eventually exempted from temettu, after early attempts at taxation - they paid other farm taxes instead, such as a new form of √¢≈ü√¢r which was imposed as part of the same tax reforms. Foreigners were initially exempted, but there were later attempts to extract temettu payments from foreigners resident in the Ottoman empire. This extension of temettu was abolished in 1906 but later reinstated at the start of World War I and extended to foreigners in any profession.

Its narrative contains the best summary of the core of Islam: IslƒÅm (ÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ), which is described with the \\"Five Pillars of Islam,\\" ƒ™mƒÅn (ÿ•ŸäŸÖÿßŸÜ), which is described with the \\"Six Articles of Faith,\\" I·∏•sƒÅn (ÿ•ÿ≠ÿ≥ÿßŸÜ), or \\"doing what is beautiful,\\" and al-SƒÅ‚Äôah (ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿßÿπÿ©), or The Hour, which is not described, but signs are given. This hadith is found in both the ·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏• al-BukhƒÅrƒ´ and the ·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏• Muslim collections and is known to express the religion of Islam in a nutshell. Muslim scholars named this hadith \\"the Hadith of Gabriel\\" (·∏•adƒ´th Jibrƒ´l) because the archangel Gabriel appears to the Prophet and those around him in a human form. Al-BukhƒÅrƒ´'s version Narrated by Abu Huraira, one of the Prophet's closest Sahabah: One day while the Prophet was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, \\"What is faith?\\" Allah's Messenger replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection.\\" Then he further asked, \\"What is Islam?\\" Allah's Messenger replied, \\"To worship Allah Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay the compulsory charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.\\" Then he further asked, \\"What is Ihsan (perfection)?\\" Allah's Messenger replied, \\"To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you.\\" Then he further asked, \\"When will the Hour be established?\\" Allah's Messenger replied, \\"The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents. # When a slave gives birth to her master. # When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah. The Prophet then recited: \\"Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour--.\\" (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet said, \\"That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion.\\" Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all that as a part of faith. Muslim's version Also from 'Umar', there is that he said, \\"While we were sitting with the Messenger of God, may God bless with him and grant him peace, one day a man came up to us whose clothes were extremely white, whose hair was extremely black, upon whom traces of traveling could not be seen, and whom none of us knew, who sat down knee- to-knee with the Prophet, may God bless with him and grant him peace. [The man] said, 'Muhammad, tell me about Islam.' [Muhammad, may God bless with him and grant him peace,] said, 'Islam is that you witness that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God, and you establish the prayer, and you give the Zakat, and you fast Ramadan, and you perform the hajj to the House if you are able.' He said, 'You have told the truth,' and we were amazed at him asking him and [then] telling him that he told the truth. He said, 'Tell me about Iman.' He said, 'That you affirm God, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day, and that you affirm the Decree [predestination], the good of it and the bad of it.' He said, 'You have told the truth.' He said, 'Tell me about Ihsan.' He said, 'That you worship God as if you see Him, for if you don't see Him then truly He sees you.' He said, 'Tell me about the Hour.' He said, 'The one asked about it knows no more than the one asking.' He said, 'Then tell me about its signs.' He said, 'That the female slave should give birth to her mistress, and you see poor, naked, barefoot shepherds of sheep and goats competing in making tall buildings.' He went away, and I remained some time. Then he asked, 'Umar, do you know who the questioner was?' I said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said, 'He was Jibril who came to you to teach you your deen'.\\" Muslim (8) narrated it.

Her husband was put under pressure to divorce her and her son was discriminated against at school. In late 1986 she began investigating the evacuation following the Chernobyl disaster. She and her husband travelled secretly into radiation-contaminated areas, since the newspaper she worked for had banned such activities. She concluded that evacuees from highly contaminated villages had been resettled in areas barely less contaminated; that the only available food for them was heavily irradiated, their accommodation was inadequate and their health problems were officially denied or ignored. Her article was refused for publication, but she distributed samizdat copies. In 1989 she was proposed as a candidate to Gorbachev's first parliament, which led to intense criticism of her in the Soviet media, and a criminal case being brought against her for her criticism of the authorities. Despite persecution of her and her supporters, meetings in her support gathered over 20,000 people and she was elected with 90.4%. On the Ecology and Glasnost Committee of the Supreme Soviet, she continued her campaign for full disclosure of the Chernobyl contamination. In 1990 she was appointed to a Commission inquiring into Chernobyl, and made a presentation on the subject to the European Parliament. Yaroshinskaya and the Commission were systematically obstructed by bureaucrats, and she was not permitted to copy relevant documents. Despite this she succeeded in making copies of top-secret documents of the Politburo of the Central Committee, which she summarised in an article, Forty secret protocols of the Kremlin wise men, published by Izvestia and the Western press. During a publicly broadcast parliamentary session, Yaroshinskaya presented Gorbachev a video cassette documenting terrible living conditions of people in areas contaminated by Chernobyl, thus breaking the information blockade on Chernobyl. She publicly released top secret reports of the Politburo of the Central Committee. The same day, two assassination attempts were made against her. Yaroshinskaya initiated many democratic laws in Russia and Ukraine. Following the collapse of the USSR, she published articles criticising Gorbachev, and criticising Ukraine's transformation into a totalitarian \\"communist reserve\\". Two criminal cases were brought against her, and eventually persecution forced her and her family to emigrate to Russia. Yaroshinskaya's political work has involved international security, including the elimination and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. As a member of the Russian Presidential Council she participated in Preparation Committees of the United Nations (UN) in the UN Conference on Nuclear Non- proliferation Treaty (1995), and in the UN Women's Conference (1995). Yaroshinskaya is founder and President of the Ecological Charity Fund, the first private ecological charity in Russia. Through the Fund she initiated creation of The Nuclear Encyclopedia, which became a reference for anti- nuclear NGOs around the Commonwealth of Independent States. Yaroshinskaya is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

The idiopathic scoliosis accounts for 80‚Äì90% of scoliosis cases.

Szel√©nyi, F. Geiger, M. Rauschmann, U. Ziemann, 2008. A short spinal cord and associated nerve tensions has been proposed as a cause and model for idiopathic scoliosis. Besides idiopathic scoliosis being more frequent in certain families, it is suspected to be transmitted via autosomal dominant inheritance. Estrogens could also play a crucial part in the progression of idiopathic scoliosis through their roles in bone formation, growth, maturation and turnover. Finally, collagen, intervertebral disc and muscle abnormalities have been suggested as the cause in idiopathic scoliosis, although these are perhaps results rather than causes. Demographic data The patient's age at presentation of scoliosis, the remaining growth, the menarche status and the magnitude of the curve are used to foresee the idiopathic scoliosis curve progression. However, the relative importance of each factor and how they may interact is not clearly defined.The natural history of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; Hee-Kit Wong, Ken-Jin Tan, 2010. The earlier the scoliosis appears, the more likely it will progress. Though it is recommended that idiopathic scoliotic people should practice a sport for aerobic exercise and development of a positive body image,Scientific exercises approach to scoliosis (SEAS): efficacy, efficiency and innovation; Michele Romano, Alessandra Negrini, Silvana Parzini, and Stefano Negrini, 2008. practice of a sport at a competitive level is to be avoided. = Age = Idiopathic scoliosis can appear at different ages. Infantile idiopathic scoliosis that appear from the birth to 3 years old, account for 0.5% of idiopathic scoliosis. Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis that appear from the 4 to 10 years old, account for 10.5% of idiopathic scoliosis. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis that appear after the age of 10 years, account for 89% of idiopathic scoliosis.Pathogenesis of Idiopathic Scoliosis Revisited; William E. Stehbens, 2003. From these statistics, it seems that individuals are at highest risk of developing idiopathic scoliosis during adolescence. = Physical activity level = Because scoliotic people have higher joint laxity compared to non-scoliotic people, they are drawn toward gymnastics but the practice of gymnastics for less than 20 hours training per week does not cause scoliosis. Based on populations that had more than 20 hours training per week, idiopathic scoliosis has been observed among 10% of tennis players, 16% of young swimmersScoliosis in swimmers; Becker, TJ, 1986. and 24% in professional ballet companies.Why do idiopathic scoliosis patients participate more in gymnastics?; C.

The exposure of the body to high repetitive mechanical constraints may influence the occurrence of idiopathic scoliosis. Physiology Cobb angle measurement of a scoliosis; concave side on the left; convex side on the right Vertebra and curves of the vertebral column Cobb angle is a common measure to classify scoliosis. The greater the angle, the more serious is the disease but the smaller is the number of patients. One to three out of every hundred people have idiopathic scoliosis curves greater than 10¬∞ with an equal proportion of boys and girls. One to three out of every thousand people have idiopathic scoliosis curves greater than 30¬∞ with a ratio of eight girls for every one boy.Scoliosis: Review of diagnosis and treatment; Joseph A Janicki, Benjamin Alman, 2007. Scoliosis is also classified according to the region(s) they affect. The vertebral column can be deformed at the thoracic level, at the lumbar level or at both. In the lumbar region, scoliosis induces perturbations to standing balance. The thoracic region is the location that most impacts movement strategies.Influence of different types of progressive idiopathic scoliosis on static and dynamic postural control; Gauchard G, Lascombes P, Kuhnast M, Perrin P, 2001. Scoliosis impedes on the movement of the ribs, places the respiratory muscles at a mechanical disadvantage and displaces the various organs of the thoracic cavity.Scoliosis and the respiratory system; Anastassios C. Koumbourlis, 2006. = Skeleton = In a scoliotic patient, the vertebral column experiences extension forces on the convex side and compression forces on the concave side. At the apical vertebra, average bone density for the concave cortical bone is higher than for the convex cortical bone, and cancellous bone density is higher for the concave side than for the convex side.Adam, C. & Askin, G. (2009). Lateral bone density variations in the scoliotic spine. Bone, (45). 799-807. The concave side of a vertebra is less porous and has a thicker cortical bone than the convex side, which is consistent with Wolff's law about bone remodeling.A Comparison of the Microarchitectural Bone Adaptations of the Concave and Convex Thoracic Spinal Facets in Idiopathic Scoliosis; Kevin G. Shea, Tyler Ford, BS, Roy D.

Effects on movement Since idiopathic scoliosis and its surgery affect the vertebrae and the joints along the spine, the range of motion is expected to be different between patients and non-scoliotic people. There is a hypothesis that states that the vertebral column behaves like a torsional spring: while walking, the angular momentum of the shoulders compensates the angular momentum of the pelvis (i.e. when the shoulders rotate clockwise, the pelvis rotates counterclockwise; when the pelvis rotates clockwise, the shoulders rotate counterclockwise).An hypothesis for the role of the spine in human locomotion: A challenge to current thinking; S. Gracovetsky, 1985. As scoliosis perturbs the architecture of the shoulders, spine and pelvis, gait also differs between patients and non-scoliotic people. = Range of motion = Independently of the Cobb angle, the affected vertebra and the age, idiopathic scoliotic people have a larger rachis flexion range of motion and a narrower hips extension range of motion than non-scoliotic people. The range of motion for rachis extension, hips flexion, left and right lateral flexions are similar to non-scoliotic people. After arthrodesis, all rachis ranges of motion decrease because of surgery but hips extension range of motion is comparable to the one of non-operated scoliotic people.Le mouvement de la colonne scoliotique √† l‚Äô√¢ge adulte, Range of motion of the scoliotic spine in adults; B. Biot, E. Cl√©ment, M. Lejeune, 2003. = Gait = In terms of gait, while walking at a constant speed of 4 km/h for a few minutes until a steady state is reached, relative to non-scoliotic people, idiopathic scoliotic people have a frontal (i.e. coronal) pelvis, hip, and shoulder, transversal hip and sagittal knee motion restriction. The step length is reduced and the stance phase duration is also reduced.Gait in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: kinematics and electromyographic analysis; P. Mahaudens, X. Banse, M. Mousny, C.

Surgical treatment of thoracolumbar/lumbar adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, whether performed with anterior spinal fusion or posterior spinal fusion arthrodesis, results in overall positive changes that lead to partial normalization of some gait parameters. After surgery, a slight reduction of trunk rotation, a decrease in shoulder rotation, an increase in frontal motion of pelvic and hips (pelvic tilt and hip abduction) are observed and no changes occurred in lower extremities during gait (knee and ankle).Gait in thoracolumbar/lumbar adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: effect of surgery on gait mechanisms; Philippe Mahaudens, C.

History The company was founded by Alfredo da Silva in 1871 and managed by his descendants, including Jos√© Manuel de Mello as a family-run business conglomerate. CUF was one of the largest and most diversified Portuguese corporations from the 1930s until 1974. The company grew and developed as a large conglomerate enforcing a business model with similarities to South Korean chaebols and Japanese keiretsus and zaibatsus. With its core businesses (cement, chemicals, petrochemicals, agrochemicals, textiles, beer, beverages, metallurgy, naval construction, electrical equipment, oilseeds, insurance, banking, wood pulp, tourism, mining, etc.) and corporate headquarters located in mainland Portugal, but also with branches, plants and several developing business projects all around the Portuguese Empire, specially in the Portuguese territories of Angola and Mozambique, CUF was for many years the largest employer and exporter of Portugal. The company had also its own sports club, founded as a truly works team in 1937. It was located in Lisbon's industrial suburb of Barreiro, and was called Grupo Desportivo da CUF. The club was a major contender in the main Portuguese Football Championship but was disbanded and replaced by G.D. Fabril due to the 1974 military coup. After the Carnation Revolution military coup on April 25, 1974, and the fall of the Estado Novo regime that ruled the intercontinental country from 1933 to 1974, CUF entered in collapse. Many of its companies were forcibly nationalized by the communist inspired National Salvation Junta, and the dismembered company fell into decline, losing all of its splendour and importance. After the turmoil of the Carnation Revolution from 1974 to 1976, its communist inspiration fade away from 1977 to 1978. In 1979, the founding family (the Mellos) resumed its business activity in Portugal and would proceed to found the Grupo Jos√© de Mello (Jos√© de Mello Group). Step by step, the CUF was revived with the acquisition of several chemical industry assets in the country from the 1980s to 1997, when it was in position to buy Quimigal (founded after the forcible nationalizations as the chemical company of the State) in the privatization of that company. During the 1990s and 2000s, CUF's main industrial assets were located in Estarreja where the company produced aniline and nitrobenzene. Also in the 2000s, the company started to develop innovative projects in other fields. The nanotechnology company Innovnano Innovnano inaugura nova f√°brica em 2011 , Grupo Jos√© de Mello was founded in 2003 by CUF in Aljustrel. Its main facilities, including state-of-the-art research and development center and manufacturing plant, were scheduled to be relocated to the Coimbra's iParque in 2012.

This environment is characterized by oceanic, geological and biological conditions, as described below. The water in this environment is shallow and clear, allowing the formation of different sedimentary structures, carbonate rocks, coral reefs, and allowing certain organisms to survive and become fossils. Sediment The sediment itself is often composed of limestone, which forms readily in shallow, warm calm waters. The shallow marine environments are not exclusively composed of siliciclastic or carbonaceous sediments. While they cannot always coexist, it is possible to have a shallow marine environment composed solely of carbonaceous sediment or one that is composed completely of siliciclastic sediment. Shallow water marine sediment is made up of larger grain sizes because smaller grains have been washed out to deeper water. Within sedimentary rocks composed of carbonaceous sediment, there may also be evaporite minerals. The most common evaporite minerals found within modern and ancient deposits are gypsum, anhydrite, and halite; they can occur as crystalline layers, isolated crystals or clusters of crystals. In terms of geologic time, it is said that most Phanerozoic sedimentary rock was deposited in shallow marine environments as about 75% of the sedimentary carapace is made up of shallow marine sediments; it is then assumed that Precambrian sedimentary rocks were too, deposited in shallow marine waters, unless it is specifically identified otherwise. This trend is seen in the North American and Caribbean region. Also, as a result of supercontinent breakup and other shifting tectonic plate processes, shallow marine sediment displays large variations in terms of quantity in the geologic time. Sedimentary Structures Various types of structures form in shallow marine environments. For example, Graded-bedding, which occurs when beds have vertical gradation in grain size, with the smallest grains at the top. Also, Ripples, which are the smallest bedform type, and dunes, which are similar to ripples except are larger. Palimpsest ripples - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo Carbonaceous sedimentary rocks with several kinds of sedimentary structures within them can be found in shallow marine environments; they are a group of rocks that have a significant amount of non-skeletal matter along with siliciclastic or chemical constituents. Some examples include: Cross stratification is a layering structure found in gravel, sand, and coarse silt- sized sediment; the strata are distinct layers of sediment that are steeply inclined to the underlying surfaces of the deposit. Desiccation cracks are cracks formed due to drying out of newly deposited mud; these form in sub- aerial climates. Syneresis cracks are cracks in mud formed by mechanisms other than sub-aerial climate exposure. These mechanisms include Contraction caused by the clumping of settled clay sediment, contraction due to the deposition/compaction of a settling clay layer during faulting, compaction of smectitic clay because of lost interlayer water due to a change in salinity in surrounding water, compaction dewatering under sediment causing injection from below or collapsing from above, and tensional openings due to down-sloping of a surface mud layer. Fenestrae is an open or partially filled space occupied by different sediment or cement in the rock. Flame structures is mud shaped like flames that intrude the overlying layer of rock. Convolute folds are complicated folds in beds into irregular anticlines and/or synclines. Flutes are outstretched ridges that are rounded at one end and flared at the other. Groove casts are outstretched, almost straight grooves in sediment caused by the dragging of an object such as a rock, piece of wood, etc. Chevron structures are a type of groove cast that is v-shaped as a result of two or more stress directions; they occur on the bottoms of beds deposited in shallow water environments. Water composition The water in this environment is mostly clear and shallow. It is said that if shallow marine environments can be defined by their distributional patterns of marine organisms in terms of temperature, then deductions can be made from that of the past patterns in terms of paleolithic zones. Today, there are 3 major defining criteria used in defining shallow marine environments, these are The faunal provinces, the faunal elements, and the degree of latitude. However, the limits of different present-day shallow marine environments in terms of climatic zones are seldom agreed on. Also, many shallow marine environments are often associated with carbonate factory zones. In these zones, processes that remove the CO‚ÇÇ from water to cause the bicarbonate ions to change into carbonate ions are important and support lime precipitation. Increasing temperature, intense evaporation, and mixing water that is high in CO‚ÇÉ and low in calcium cations with seawater are some examples of processes that change bicarbonate ions to carbonate ions. Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by being dissolved in water and is turned into carbonic acid. The carbonic acid then weathers rocks, creating bicarbonate and other ions. Then the calcium carbonate is a precipitate from calcium and the bicarbonate ions that formed through organisms like coral, and then the carbon is stored in layers of limestone on the seafloor. In terms of geologic time, the composition of limestone has changed from calcite rich limestone to aragonite rich limestone. The presence of magnesium ions at certain concentrations inhibits the ability to precipitate calcite. Aragonite, however, has the same chemical formula as calcite but it is in a different crystal system that is much less prone to the magnesium preventing the precipitation of this mineral, which would prevent it from forming carbonate rocks. At times in geologic history where the Mg and Ca ratio were different, and the seas were more abundant in calcite and this was as a result of the high rates of seafloor spreading because of tectonic plate movement and action. The more spreading, the more the Magnesium gets removed, so more calcite is precipitated, and calcite will be more abundant than aragonite. Organisms Echinoderms Some organisms in this environment, specifically those in the intertidal zone, are sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, worms, clams, mussels, predatory crustaceans, barnacles and small fish. Hydrozoa, or hydroids, also live in shallow marine ecosystems and eat surrounding algae and zooplankton. Some species of isopods and amphipods are found in the intertidal zones and create several different burrows and surface tracks in the sediment. Brittle stars have been seen buried in sediment with their arms showing through the sediment; this behaviour has been noted in several shallow marine areas. As well, carbonate reefs can be found in the depositional environment that is shallow marine areas; they are host to reefs and organisms that reside in reefs. Recent estimates regarding the numbers of species on coral reefs range from 1‚Äì9 million. There are 3 main types of reef formations: fringing reefs, these reefs are attached to the shore, barrier reefs, which are separated from mainland by a lagoon, and atoll reefs. Organisms that live in this environment include red algae, green algae, bivalves and echinoderms. Many of these organisms contribute to the formation of reefs. Also, Unicellular dinoflagellates live in the tissues of corals, and have a mutualistic relationship in which the dinoflagellates provide the corals with organic molecules. Fossils Stromatolites in Sharkbay The vast majority of the fossil record has been found after the shallow water marine environment has been lithified. Many of these fossils were deposited at times when much of Earth was covered with shallow seas, supporting a wide variety of organisms. Several fossils can be found/formed in this environment. Some examples include: Skolithos Ichnofacies are trace fossils that are vertical, cylindrical or U-shaped burrows created by organisms for protection. Glossifungites ichnofacies are trace fossils that are vertical, cylindrical, U or tear-shaped borings or burrows created by organisms like shrimp, crabs, worms and bivalves. Stromatolites are fossils that are laminated sedimentary structures that form when cyanobacteria form microbial mats which then trap clay and/or silt sediment and organic materials to form the fossil.

During the First World War, Inglis was a chaplain to the British Army and was killed during the Battle of the Somme. Early life and education Inglis was born in the Hanover Square area of London. He was the youngest son of Nova Scotian Sir John Eardley Wilmot Inglis (1814‚Äì1862) (who died 8 months before Rupert was born) and Julia Selina Thesiger (1833‚Äì1904); his father commanded the British forces during the Siege of Lucknow in 1857. His mother, who was the daughter of Frederic Thesiger, the first Baron Chelmsford, Lord Chancellor, later wrote of her experiences during the siege including extracts from her diary. He was educated at Rugby School from 1877 before going up to University College, Oxford in 1881 to read history. On leaving Oxford in 1885, he attended Ely Theological College and was ordained deacon in 1889. Family Inglis was the youngest of seven children. His siblings were: * John Frederic Inglis (b. 1852, died an infant) * John Frederic Inglis (1853‚Äì1923), who played cricket for Kent and football for Wanderers and Scotland * Charles George Inglis (1855‚Äì1923), who became a tea planter on the Agra Kandy Estate in Ceylon. * Alfred Markham Inglis (1856‚Äì1919), who played cricket for Kent * Victoria Alexandrina Inglis (1859‚Äì1929), married Hubert Ashton, mother of cricketers Hubert, Gilbert, Percy and Claude * Julia Mathilda Inglis (1861‚Äì1929), married to Sir George Herman Collier of the India Office On 11 June 1900, he married Helen Mary Gilchrist. They had three children: * Joan Clara Thesiger Inglis (1901‚Äì1967) * John Gilchrist Thesiger Inglis (1906‚Äì1972) who was knighted and rose to the rank of Vice-Admiral. * Margaret Cohcrane Inglis (1911‚Äì1994) Sporting career At Rugby School, Inglis was a member of the school cricket and rugby teams. He played cricket for M.C.C. against the school in June 1879, aged 16. He also played against Marlborough College in July 1881 when he was the top-scorer in the first innings, helping Rugby win the match by two wickets. He was a member of the school rugby XV in 1879 and 1880 and also of the rugby XVs at Oxford University in 1883 and 1884, winning his Blue. Inglis became a member of the Blackheath rugby club and made three appearances for the England national rugby union team. His debut came against Wales at Rectory Field, Blackheath on 2 January 1886 in a match which England won on tries scored. This was followed by a victory over Ireland in February and a draw with Scotland in March. As a result, England shared the 1886 Home Nations Championship with Scotland. Clerical career Inglis was ordained deacon in 1889 by the Bishop of Beverley. He became curate at Helmsley from 1889 to 1890 and then at Basingstoke from 1892 to 1899 (being ordained priest by the Bishop of Winchester in 1894), before being appointed Rector of Frittenden, Kent in 1900. On 13 April 1905, he read the committal part of the service during the funeral of his uncle, General Frederic Thesiger, Lord Chelmsford. First World War In 1915, Inglis decided that, if he was to encourage the young men of his village to sign up for the army, he would also have to volunteer. At the age of 51, therefore, he was commissioned as a Chaplain to the Forces, 4th Class on 5 July 1915; he was attached to 1st Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry, arriving in France later in July 1915. For a short while he did duty at No. 23 General Hospital, √âtaples, and then joined No. 21 Casualty Clearing Station at Corbie, near Albert. In December 1915, he was attached to the 16th Infantry Brigade, 6th Division, in the Ypres Salient. Throughout his time at the front, he wrote home regularly either to his parishioners or to his wife. After the war, his widow edited the letters and privately published a volume as a record for their children and others. His explanatory letter to his parishioners opens the volume: At first, his letters home are optimistic and bright but the tone changes as he spends more time close to the front. He arrived at √âtaples on 5 July and spent his time there acting as a censor of soldier's letters home as well as giving spiritual guidance to the wounded and conducting Sunday worship. He also helped the soldiers write letters home to their wives and families. On 20 September 1915, he was transferred to the casualty clearing station at Corbie, located in a former bicycle factory. As well as his spiritual work, he helped feed and dress the wounded patients. His first period of leave since enlisting came in November, when he spent a week home, before returning to the front. On his return passage, he was shipped from Southampton on a crowded troop ship. Within a few weeks of returning to the front, he was again on the move; he was attached to the 16th Infantry Brigade, 6th Division, consisting of the 1st King's Shropshire Light Infantry, the 1st Buffs, the 2nd York and Lancasters and the 8th Bedfords. By 18 December, he was camped in a wood near Vlamertinghe where he met a fellow chaplain, Neville Talbot, son of the Bishop of Winchester, who had helped found the Toc H movement, and nursed him through a bout of flu. By Christmas, Talbot had returned home on leave and Inglis was senior chaplain. On Christmas Day, he had church services in the morning and then was entertained with a band concert in the evening. There was no truce: \\"The firing was not heavy but there was some going on all day. . .\\" By this time, his letters home regularly complained about the conditions, both in the field hospital (\\"You would love to see this hut ‚Äì the untidiness of it beats anything I have ever seen\\", \\"It's awfully difficult to get coal here ‚Äì our allowance is 1 ¬Ω lbs. per head per day. It isn‚Äôt much, to keep this and the kitchen fire going\\") and in the battlefield generally (\\"[the] mud . . . beggars description, and is getting worse\\", \\"the trenches are in an awful state; it is of course, quite impossible to drain them, as everything is flat\\"). He was able to return home on leave at the end of January 1916, but was soon \\"back in my little wooden hut'\\" again. He continued to spend his time ministering to the needs of the injured soldiers and helping them write letters home. He also assisted the surgeon in operations in the field hospital; in a letter to his daughter Joan in February he relates an anecdote about his work in the hospital: After a brief spell at Calais in March, Inglis returned to the Ypres Salient where the brigade came under heavy bombardment, resulting in many casualties including the death of the Colonel, Edward Bourryau Luard (1870‚Äì1916) (son of General Richard Luard). Over the next few months, he was regularly on the move with the brigade, spending much of his time, when not involved with funerals and other church services, organising a shop to supply the soldiers and later acting as \\"Mess President\\", organising the canteen. By mid September, he was at Ginchy; two days after the Battle of Ginchy, when the village was re-taken from the enemy, he describes walking across the battlefield: \\"Then I walked across country with them ‚Äî a wonderful country, all shell holes and trenches ‚Äî trenches which till recently were German.\\" His final letter home was dated 17 September 1916 in which he describes his work with the stretcher bearers, bringing the wounded soldiers to the dressing station. His letter closes: The following day, 18 September, he joined a party of stretcher-bearers, in order to help bring in the wounded. While doing this, he was struck by a fragment of shell and while his wound was being dressed a second shell killed him instantly. In his letter of condolence to Mrs. Inglis, Rev. Neville Talbot praised Inglis' bravery and gallantry: He was buried close to the battlefield at Ginchy; his body was not recovered after the end of the war. Tributes Apart from the letter from Neville Talbot, several other fellow officers sent tributes to Mrs. Inglis: Memorials Inglis' name is among the 72,000 dead with no known grave commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial. There is also a memorial to him at All Saints' Church, Basingstoke where he had served as a curate. At Frittenden, he is commemorated on the War Memorial while the lychgate at St. Mary's church is dedicated to him; there is also a tablet to his memory in the chancel of the church. On Remembrance Sunday 2009, Inglis' nephew, Hubert Ashton, preached at St. Mary's church, Frittenden. Parishioners also visited Ginchy where a memorial service was held in honour of the First World War dead. A memorial to the students of the Ely Theological College is now at King's School, Ely.

The tower takes its name from four large granite elephants which flank the gate, standing back to back carrying the tower on their backs. History The Elephant Tower photographed by Frederik Riise Completed in 1901, the Elephant Tower was built at the same time as the Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse. The architect was Vilhelm Dahlerup, who also worked on the previous stages but not the new brewhouse which was designed by Vilhelm Klein. Together with the original Ny Carlsberg building and the Dipylon, the tower formed the main Ny Carlsberg complex, centred around a courtyard. The space above the tower originally served as a water tower and herb silo. The new Elephant Tower marked the entrance to the brewery from the Valby side, complementing the Dipylon which served as the entrance from the city. Architecture Typical of Ny Carlsberg's architecture and Vilhelm Dahlerup's work in general, the Elephant Tower is built in a colourful Historicist style inspired by various periods and cultures. =Elephants= The elephant feature, which was Carl Jacobsen's own idea, was inspired by Bernini's obelisk-carrying elephant on Piazza della Minerva in Rome.Visit Carlsberg The four elephants were created by the sculptor Hans Peder Pedersen-Dan, based on a sketch by Dahlerup. =The spire= The upper tower, which has a floor area of only 115 square metres, is built in red, ornamental brick. It has tall, round-arched windows and is topped by a copper-clad onion dome.

They have the particularity to fit firmly the ankle and correct concisely the foot deformity within special pressure points. It is stated to help in improving mobility and stability of the ankle joint on CP patients,1Diane l. Damiano, Allison s. Arnold, Katherine m. Steele, Scott l. Delp.

Different from a traditional Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO), which is typically stiff and rigid, a DAFO is characteristically thin, flexible and wraps around the patient‚Äôs entire foot in order to provide improved sensation and alignment. Initially designed for use by pediatric patients but now sometimes used by the adult population, a DAFO encourages range of motion, allowing children to learn movement by moving and providing minimal support, only where the patient needs it. DAFOs are frequently prescribed to assist with mobility and motor skills of children with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, clubfoot and autism. The concept for the original DAFO was developed in 1985 as collaboration between Don Buethorn, CPO, and Nancy M. Hylton, PT, LO. The two worked together to create a thin, flexible brace that would meet the needs of pediatric patients with neurodevelopment challenges and the result was the creation of a Washington state-based company, Cascade Dafo, Inc. Evolution: Initially dynamic Ankle Foot Orthoses were designed to stimulate or inhibate certain muscles in order to control lower leg spasticity by the application of pressure zones on the foot. The concept was further developed and DAFO's are now prescribed in order to re-align and maintain the foot so that gross motor function is improved, especially for CP patients. Indications : It is indicated for patients with flat valgus foot from 5 to 10 years old. Patients with mild deformity of the foot. Advantages: -Increases stride length, reduce excessive plantar flexion for CP children.Sandra A Radtka et al.

Found at various times during their episcopal careers staking positions on both sides of the developing theological debate and internal Church politicking, Ursacius and his fellows were seen to vacillate according to the political winds. __TOC__ Early life Born at the latest in c. 300,Wace, Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies. little is known of Ursacius' early career, but he appears already to have become bishop of Singidunum by 335, in which capacity he formed part of the group of bishops empanelled at the Synod of Tyre to investigate the veracity of accusations of impropriety made against Athanasius of Alexandria.Sozomen, Church History, Book 2.25. The endorsement by the group of the fabricated charges made against Athanasius is generally attributed to their partisanship for the theology of Arius.Athanasius, ad Episcopos Aegyptiae 7, p. 218 . The association of Ursacius (and his fellow Illyrian bishops) with Arius is postulated by Wace to have begun during the period of Arius' exile in Illyria in the period immediately after the Council of Nicaea.Wace, Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies. Ursacius and Valens next appear in 342 at Constantinople assisting with the consecration of Macedonius as bishop of the metropolis. On the restoration of Athanasius of Alexandria to his see in 346, Ursacius, along with his confederate Valens, recanted both of their previous hostility to Athanasius and to his Trinitarian theology. Accordingly, they journeyed to Rome, presenting a written recantation to its bishop, Julius, and wrote to Athanasius, expressing their willingness to hold communion with him in the future.Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, Book 2.24. Found at various times during their episcopal careers staking positions on both sides of the developing theological debate and internal Church politicking, Ursacius and his fellows were seen by contemporaneous and later Church history sources (such as Socrates of Constantinople) to vacillate according to the political winds, being 'always inclined to side with the dominant party.'Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, Book 2. 37.

Casey Guernsey first ran for State Representative in 2006, losing to incumbent Jim Whorton. Whorton was term-limited under Missouri law from seeking reelection in 2008. In November of that year Guernsey defeated Democrat Mike Hepler to win his first term in the House. Guernsey ran unopposed in 2010. In November, 2012 Guernsey ran for the newly created 2nd District seat, defeating Independent candidate Jim Nash to earn a third term in the Missouri House. =Legislative assignments= Representative Guernsey serves on the following committees: * Chair, Agribusiness. * Appropriations - Agriculture and Natural Resources subcommittee. * Budget. * Rules. * Special Standing Committee on Renewable Energy. =Political future= On January 31, 2014 Representative Guernsey announced he would not be seeking re-election for a final two-year term from the 2nd District, as allowed under Missouri term limits. Neither, said Guernsey, would he be a candidate for the 12th District Missouri Senate seat being vacated by term-limited Republican Brad Lager, even after loaning his campaign committee $100,000 to run for the vacated Senate seat and clearing the primary field of opposition. Guernsey cited a desire to take a different direction in his life and the large time spent away from home serving his constituents as reasons for his decision.

It features a middle and upper school, serving grades 5‚Äì12. Washington Latin was modeled after Boston Latin School, which was the first public school in the United States that taught children under the age of 25. The motto of the school is discite servaturi, meaning \\"Learn, those who are about to serve\\". History WLPCS opened in 2006 with 179 students in grades five through seven. They have added a grade each year and graduated their first class of high school seniors on 8 June, 2012. Their first location was in Christ Church of Washington (now Embassy Church) at 3855 Massachusetts Avenue (two blocks west of Washington National Cathedral). In 2008, they added a second campus for the eighth and ninth graders at 4715 16th Street on the corner of Decatur Street NW, which is now the location of the Jewish Primary Day School of the Nation's Capital. In 2009 they moved the entire middle school (grades 5‚Äì8) to the Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church (now Iglesia Ni Cristo - Church of Christ) property at 4115 16th Street NW on the corner of Upshur Street NW, just a half-mile from the Upper School. In 2010, they added an additional campus for their Upper School at 4501 16th Street NW, on the corner of Allison Street NW in an annex of the Simpson- Hamline United Methodist Church. On July 16, 2012, Washington Latin was awarded the former building of the Rudolph Elementary School at 5200 2nd Street, NW. They modernized and renovated the building and constructed a library. A gymnasium addition was completed on June 9th, 2016. The gymnasium is the first cross laminated timber (CLT) structure in the District of Columbia. The design of the modernization and addition projects was done by Perkins Eastman Architects and Demian Wilbur Architects, and constructed by MCN Build. All 600 students of the Upper School and Middle School moved into the same building at the start of the 2013‚Äì14 school year. The campus is approximately 75,000 square feet on 5.29 acres and includes two large playing fields. Academics Washington Latin offers a classical education. That model emphasizes the Socratic method, recitation of information for memorization, and public speaking. While Latin is the main language studied, French, Mandarin Chinese, and Arabic are also offered. Students are required to take Latin through level three and another modern language through level two in order to graduate. 48% of Washington Latin's Upper School teachers have a graduate degree. =Results= As of 2017, Washington Latin's Middle School and Upper School are both rated Tier 1 by the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board. Washington Latin's 4-year high school graduation rate is 90.3%. The school states that more than 75% of their students' AP exam results are passing scores. In 2017, 66% of Washington Latin students achieved proficiency in the English Language Arts/Literacy section of their PARCC exams and 52% achieved proficiency in the Math section. The same year, all public and public charter school students in the District of Columbia averaged 31% proficient in English Language Arts/Literacy and 27% proficient in Math.

Biography =Early Life, 1553-1604= Born on July 15, 1553, Johann Schweikhard von Kronberg was the third son of Hartmut XIII von Kronburg (1517‚Äì1591) and his wife Barbara von Sickingen (1522‚Äì1577). His father was an administrator for the Archbishopric of Mainz. With his older brothers taking over the family's offices, Johann was destined for a career in the church from an early age. He was elected to the cathedral chapter of Mainz Cathedral at a young age through his father's influence. He was a canon of St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz from 1564 to 1566. He was then sent to the Collegium Germanicum in Rome. There, he became friends with Johannes Busaeus, who was later a Jesuit theologian teaching at the University of Mainz. After his return to Mainz, the papal legate Giovanni Morone appointed him prior of Stiftes St. Peter vor Mainz. He became a Domkapitular in 1582, then became schoolmaster in 1584. He was dean of St. Alban's Abbey by 1588, and then dean of the Marienstiftes in 1599. He became the treasurer of the Archbishopric in 1599. =Elector, 1604-1626= Following the death of Johann Adam von Bicken, the cathedral chapter of Mainz Cathedral elected Johann Schweikhard von Kromberg as the new Archbishop of Mainz on February 17, 1604 with the support of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, who feared that the election of the rival candidate, Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, Bishop of W√ºrzburg would destabilize relations with the Protestants of the Holy Roman Empire. After Pope Clement VIII confirmed his election, he was consecrated as archbishop in November 1604. He completed the work of the Counter-Reformation in the Archbishopric of Mainz that had been begun by his predecessors. He supported the work of the Jesuits and Capuchins in the Archbishopric. He did not persecute Protestants, however, and maintained the religious freedom of Erfurt. He commissioned the Schloss Johannisburg, which was built in Aschaffenburg from 1605 to 1614. Under his reign the old arsenal building was finished. Johann Schweikhard von Kronberg opposed the intervention of Henry IV of France in the War of the J√ºlich succession in 1609. In 1618, he opposed the decision of Frederick V, Elector Palatine to accept the Bohemian Crown, but he also opposed the Spanish occupation of the Electorate of the Palatinate. In the imperial election of 1619, he voted for Ferdinand II. He died in Aschaffenburg on September 17, 1626. References *This page is based on this page on German Wikipedia.

Harmony and balance were an important part of their worldview. They participated in an event where the main focus was restoring balance called the busk, or green corn ceremony. When it was time to collect new maize, house foundations were cleaned and old or worn items, such as clothing or pottery, was done away with. The busk most likely began before the Contact period but the Sara celebrated world renewal by feasting, relighting the sacred fire, and participating in other rituals. Busks during the Contact period tended to focus on bringing the community together as a single unit.VanDerwarker, A. M., Scarry, C. M., and Eastman, J. M. n.d.

A large quantity of big potsherds that were pieces of larger vessels were discovered and the evidence seemed to suggest that these large vessels were purposely smashed.

They were usually three feet deep and across and filled with food remains and other domestic refuse. Typically, these features were close to the stockades near the edge of the village and were thought to be used to prepare enormous quantities of food for ritual celebrations. Basic subsistence was an equal share of wild and domestic food resources. There is no proof that animals from Europe played any part in subsistence during the Contact period.Ward, H.

The majority of the grain was left to dry and stored so that it lasted for a long time. It could have been used in stews, bread, or used for fuel. Beans were also abundant but poorly preserved archaeologically. Squashes and gourds could have been added to soups and stews and were often modified into containers and dippers.

Though the Sara were mainly an agricultural people, they also made good use of wild nuts. Nuts were usually collected in the fall and served as additions to other foods in the winter. Hazelnuts ripened quickly while acorns and hickories took more time to ripen. Hazelnuts and acorns had to be gathered as soon as they hit the ground since they were a favorite for many of the local, indigenous animal species. Hickories had protective shells which allowed them to be gathered in a more leisurely fashion. The domestic assemblage from Upper Saratown was made up mostly of maize and nuts. Fruits made up the next highest part of the assemblage while beans and various seeds made up the smallest part.VanDerwarker, A. M., Scarry, C. M., and Eastman, J. M. n.d.

Southern Illinois University. p. 45 Trade Prior to the Late Saratown phase, trade was limited to native intermediaries who only swapped goods within trade networks. The lack of exposure to Europeans made the Saura unprepared for introduced diseases following contact. However by 1670, traders from Virginia started journeying out into the country in search of new markets so the Sara experienced a huge rise in English-made items.Ward, H. Trawick and Davis Jr., R. P. Stephen. (1999). Time before History: The Archaeology of North Carolina. Chapel Hill and London: The University of North Carolina Press. p. 248 & 254 They provided English traders with pelts and in return, received goods such as copper bells, tools, guns, and glass beads.VanDerwarker, A.

The Archaeology of Food and Identity, Occasional Paper No.34. Southern Illinois University. p. 19 However, because the Occaneechi tribe was in a dominant position over the Saura, controlled access to firearms and used intimidation tactics, they had the power to determine which items actually reached the Sara so archaeologists found the items more commonly identified as artistic media such as the beads and bells and not so much in the way of tools and weapons.Ward, H. Trawick and Davis Jr., R. P. Stephen. (1999). Time before History: The Archaeology of North Carolina. Chapel Hill and London: The University of North Carolina Press. p. 248 & 254 Diseases, Death and Mortuary Patterns Mortuary patterns, like community patterns, changed drastically during the Late Saratown phase. At Upper Saratown, graves were deep shaft-and-chamber pits and placed in close proximity to houses. The bodies of the deceased were typically found in flexed positions and with ornaments manufactured by Europeans, such as glass beads or copper trinkets. However, toward the end of the Late Saratown phase, tribes were becoming more aware of their susceptibleness to foreign microbes and isolating the dead in a cemetery became a necessity. Subadults became the primary group of dead, which could have meant that their deaths were the effect of a single epidemic. Individuals who survived earlier epidemics would have built up immunities, making them less vulnerable to new European diseases.Ward, H. Trawick and Davis Jr., R. P. Stephen. (1999). Time before History: The Archaeology of North Carolina. Chapel Hill and London: The University of North Carolina Press. p. 251-253 There is also evidence that shows that the dead were buried in even the most serious of epidemics. Diseases such as smallpox, measles, and other viral plagues proved to be especially deadly to the Sara because they lacked the resistance to fight them off. This was further accelerated by the movements of the growing population and intertribal contact, due to economic and political changes brought on by trade. The diseases essentially killed and disabled thousands of the Sara and by the late seventeenth century, Upper Saratown was basically destroyed.Ward, H. Trawick and Davis Jr., R. P. Stephen. (1999). Time before History: The Archaeology of North Carolina. Chapel Hill and London: The University of North Carolina Press. p. 257-259 At Upper Saratown, the number of graves was so great that archaeologists could not dig standard, 10‚Äô square excavation pits without encountering graves underneath.Ward, H. Trawick and Davis Jr., R. P. Stephen. (1999). Time before History: The Archaeology of North Carolina. Chapel Hill and London: The University of North Carolina Press. p. 259 Of course, some deaths could have also been because of raids by Northern Seneca groups who wanted to get in on the trading of pelts and were searching for slaves. The toll on the village due to the diseases and Seneca attacks caused the Sara to go south to join up with the Catawba tribe.VanDerwarker, A. M., Scarry, C. M., and Eastman, J. M. n.d. Menus for Families and Feasts: Household and Community Consumption of Plants at Upper Saratown, North Carolina. Twiss, Katheryn C. (Ed.). (2007). The Archaeology of Food and Identity, Occasional Paper No.34. Southern Illinois University. p. 19 & 20 Deaths of individuals in the tribe, whether they were family or not, tended to disrupt the balance that the Sara so highly valued. Rituals went on for several days so people could mourn in their own way. Typically, the person was buried with some of their worldly goods. Items were also given out after the funeral and a banquet for the whole community was prepared by the women related to the dead individual.VanDerwarker, A. M., Scarry, C. M., and Eastman, J. M. n.d. Menus for Families and Feasts: Household and Community Consumption of Plants at Upper Saratown, North Carolina. Twiss, Katheryn C. (Ed.). (2007). The Archaeology of Food and Identity, Occasional Paper No.34. Southern Illinois University. p. 18 The mortuary pattern changes could also have been due to their increased urge to keep balance. By changing how they took care of their dead, the Sara might have been trying to reach a certain level of ritual purity by coming up with a definite way to separate the dead individuals from the living.VanDerwarker, A. M., Scarry, C. M., and Eastman, J. M. n.d. Menus for Families and Feasts: Household and Community Consumption of Plants at Upper Saratown, North Carolina. Twiss, Katheryn C. (Ed.). (2007).

The two men wanted to salvage as much of the village as possible in order to prevent vandals from destroying any more of the village in their search for treasures. Sara burials were particularly rich in grave offerings and the archaeologists wanted to preserve them as much as possible. The excavations took place every summer until August 1981.Ward, H. Trawick and Davis Jr., R. P. Stephen. (1999). Time before History: The Archaeology of North Carolina. Chapel Hill and London: The University of North Carolina Press. p. 20 & 234 Excavations of Upper Sauratown have uncovered hundreds of human burials and pit features as well as numerous house patterns and palisades.Nolan, R.

The remains of one hundred and five individuals were removed from the site during the summer excavations. A large number of objects were found with the burials that included, but were not limited to, different types of beads, animal bones, lead shot, and turtle shell. Based on the archaeological context, the burials were classified as Native American. The artifacts and location indicated that the site belonged in the Saratown phase, which was between A.D. 1450 and 1710, and was once occupied by the Sara Indians. The Sara became one tribe with the Catawba in the 18th century so the remains can be associated with the Catawba tribe of the present day.McKeown, T. (2006, August 21).

It is a member of the grass family Poaceae. Distribution Stipa avenacea is commonly found in the Eastern United States, within various types of habitats, which include: *grasslands *deciduous hardwood hammocks, thickets, and dry woods. *upland woodlands and forests (such as dryer oak woodlands). *savannas and clearings. *rocky slopes and outcrops. The species distribution is mostly found in the Southeastern and Northeastern United States. It is found in the Great Lakes region of the U.S. Midwest and Ontario (Canada), and the shortgrass prairies of the south-central U.S. as well. The range has been documented in: Alabama; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island, New York and Florida, North and South Carolina; Georgia; Michigan; Illinois; Oklahoma, and many other states adjacent to these.USDA: Native range of Stipa avenacea . accessed 6.26.2012 Description Stipa avenacea, Black oat grass, consists of fine leaf texture that appear to be bristle-like. Its leaves are long and elongate, reaching up to in height. The plant is easily recognizable when flowering or fruiting. It can be identified by its open inflorescences, which are thin and usually cannot be seen from a distance. The branches within these inflorescences are very thin and thus can create effects of spikelets that appear to be floating in mid air. It also consists of awns, which are hairlike projections containing multicellular organisms that obtain nutrients through photosynthesis. The awns can twist and un-twist in circumstances depending on the humidity and temperature of the area, which is required for them in order to thrive within soil. They also protrude from individual flowers in the flowering clusters, which tend to develop between late spring and early summer (normally April - June). Panicles also exist within this species where it rises above the plant's rolled and thread-like leaves. It contains slender open branches, a few narrow scales and spikelets that consist of one flower. The ripened flowering heads within the spikelet remain on the grass usually until autumn, in which the awns tend to bend and twist, spreading widely from the scales. The seeds are formed as sharp needles. The palea (bract like organs found within species of grass) tends to be long and blackish, in which the upper part consists of bent and twisted awns. =Seed dispersion and burial= Uses =Cultivation= Gardens Stipa avenacea is cultivated as an ornamental grass by plant nurseries, for traditional and native plant gardens, and natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects. Black oat grass is drought-tolerant, and used in xeriscaping (water conserving landscape design). The plant is hardy to USDA zone 2 - a U.S. Hardiness Zone rating. It needs good drainage and full sun. The plants flower during the summer season. The dried flower stalks can be used in floral arrangements, and created into feathery plumes in a variety of colors. Erosion control The Black oat grass or Blackseed speargrass plant, with the typically deep root system of a bunchgrass, is planted for erosion control‚Äîsoil care. It can be planted along vulnerable areas (such as stream banks) where it can form a dense mat through water flow. Cover crop Stipa avenacea can be used as a cover crop, in which they are grown after a crop has been cut so that soil can be replenished, and is thus plowed back into the garden rather than being harvested. It is commonly said that oat grass is a good choice to use as a cover crop because when they die during the winter time, the residue will be much easier to handle when working with the soil, while preparing for planting season. Black oat grass can also serve as a 'net' to cover other simultaneously planted seeds, and later seedlings, from bird deprivation.

M. uncinata leaves and fruit M. uncinata flowers Taxonomy Melaleuca uncinata was first described in 1812 by Robert Brown in Hortus Kewensis. The specific epithet (uncinatus) is a Latin word meaning \\"bearing hooks\\" or \\"barbed\\" \\"in reference to the shape of the leaf apex\\". A review of the species was undertaken by Lyndley Craven in 1994 and some populations have been identified as new species. The populations in Queensland and New South Wales may also represent another taxon. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in the Coolgardie-Esperance region of Western Australia as well as on the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia, extending eastwards to western Victoria and south-western New South Wales. Ecology Melaleuca uncinata is the only known host of the rare and threatened Rhizanthella gardneri, the \\"underground orchid\\". Uses =Building material= Ornamental brushwood fencing comprising the grey stems, twigs and dry foliage of Melaleuca uncinata has been in use in Australia for more than 80 years. It is an important market for melaleucas although representing only 1% of the fencing market in Western Australia. Other uses include the manufacture of garden furniture, gazebos and hanging baskets. About 600,000 bundles of brushwood, each about were used in Australia in 1994 with a predicted annual market growth of 5.5%. =Essential oils= The leaves of this species have been analysed for their oil content. There appears to be different types of oil collected from two groups of plants. One group contained 1,8-cineole as its major component and the other terpinen-4-ol.

Adapted from Patten and Kelly (2010) A perceptual trap is an ecological scenario in which environmental change, typically anthropogenic, leads an organism to avoid an otherwise high-quality habitat. The concept is related to that of an ecological trap, in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat. History In a 2004 article discussing source‚Äìsink dynamics, James Battin did not distinguish between high-quality habitats that are preferred or avoided, labelling both \\"sources.\\"Battin, J. (2004) \\"When good animals love bad habitats: ecological traps and the conservation of animal populations\\" (PDF), Conservation Biology, 18: 1482‚Äì1491 The latter scenario, in which a high-quality habitat is avoided, was first recognised as an important phenomenon in 2007 by Gilroy and Sutherland,Gilroy, J. J., and W. J. Sutherland. (2007) \\"Beyond ecological traps: perceptual errors and undervalued resources,\\" Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 22: 351‚Äì356 who described them as \\"undervalued resources.\\" The term \\"perceptual trap\\" was first proposed by Michael Patten and Jeffrey Kelly in a 2010 article.Patten, M.A., and Kelly, J.F.

(2012) \\"Changing organisms in rapidly changing anthropogenic landscapes: the significance of the ‚ÄòUmwelt‚Äô-concept and functional habitat for animal conservation,\\" Evolutionary Applications, 5(2): : 144‚Äì153. argues that the term is misleading because perception is also a major component in other cases of trapping. Description Animals use discrete environmental cues to select habitat.Kristan, W. B. (2003) \\"The role of habitat selection behavior in population dynamics: source‚Äìsink systems and ecological traps,\\" Oikos, 103: 457‚Äì468 A perceptual trap occurs if change in an environmental cue leads an organism to avoid a high-quality habitat. It differs, therefore, from simple habitat avoidance, which may be a correct decision given the habitat's quality. The concept of a perceptual trap is related to that of an ecological trap, in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat. There is expected to be strong natural selection against ecological traps, but not necessarily against perceptual traps, as Allee effects may restrict a population‚Äôs ability to establish itself. Examples Patten and Kelly propose that a perceptual trap is acting on populations of the lesser prairie chicken To support the concept of a perceptual trap, Patten and Kelly cited a study of the lesser prairie chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus). The species' natural environment, shinnery oak grassland, is often treated with the herbicide tebuthiuron to increase grass cover for cattle grazing. Herbicide treatment resulted in less shrub cover, a habitat cue that caused female lesser prairie-chickens to avoid the habitat in favour of untreated areas. However, females who nested in herbicide-treated areas achieved comparable nesting successes and clutch sizes to those in untreated areas. Patten and Kelly suggest that the adverse effects of tebuthiuron treatment on nesting success are countered by various effects, such as greater nest concealment through increased grass cover. Therefore, female birds are erroneously avoiding a high-quality habitat. Patten and Kelly also cited as a possible perceptual trap the cases of the spotted towhee (Pipilo maculatus) and rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps), which tend to avoid habitat fragments, even though birds nesting in habitat fragments achieve increased nesting success due to a reduction in snake predation.Patten, M.

It is preferred because of its lower toxicity. However, many home hair dyes still use phenylenediamine.

The amount payable varied from year to year and from region to region, but the tax was payable annually, in March, to the timar holder (nominally a sipahi) or to the tax-farmer (iltizam). However, a muafname (tax exemption) might excuse a person, or a village, or an entire social group from paying resm-i m√ºcerred and related taxes; alternatively, √∂rfi taxes might be lifted from a community but they would still have to pay resm-i m√ºcerred. Resm-i m√ºcerred was paid by landless poor or unmarried peasants who did not have sufficient resources to qualify for the resm-i √ßift and the resm-i benn√¢k land-taxes - whose names, taken literally, refer to one \\"√ßift\\" of land, and a half-√ßift, respectively. This structure may have been directly inherited from the Byzantine system of land taxes, in areas which were conquered by the Ottomans. One 19th-century tahrir, from a group of villages in a district which is now in Iran, set √ßift resmi at 50 ak√ßes, bennak resmi at 18 ak√ßes, caba resmi (for farmers who rented rather than owned land) was 12 ak√ßes, and m√ºcerred resmi was valued at only 6 ak√ßes; in this case, the tahrir set aside tax revenue from the villages to support a local charitable foundation (or trust), rather than returning it directly to the state. Comparison of different tax records suggests that the ratio between tax rates for bachelors and for established farmers may have narrowed over time. Tax records show that m√ºcerred were more likely to migrate to other areas; they had fewer ties to the land, and may have been more vulnerable. Migrant m√ºcerred were more likely to make their way to a growing town; some may have moved locally, but a few would travel to Istanbul from a distant district.

The list * Russian communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin held a fascination in chess for most of his life, leading to him meeting well-known chess players of his time and referencing the board game in political speeches. There are dozens of paintings and graphics on this subject (most created by the USSR from the 1930s through the 1970s), as well as photographs that capture Lenin playing chess. Lenin's love for the game is also widely represented in memoirs of those familiar with him. Lenin's enthusiasm for chess was later used by the USSR to popularize the game between the 1920s and 1980s. In 2010, art historians connected certain auctioned rarities with Lenin and his chess lessons. *Film comedian Woody Allen, an occasional player who taught his adopted son Moses Farrow the game,The Unruly Life of Woody Allen by Marion Meade p. 206 authored a comical epistolary short story entitled \\"The Gossage-Vardebedian Papers\\" involving a chess game played via mail. The two protagonists disagree on the correct position due to alleged lost exchange. Both eventually claim victory. *Science fiction writer Isaac Asimov devoted over a page of his autobiography, I, Asimov: A Memoir, to his hopeless lack of aptitude at chess, where he rued: \\"In the years that followed, I discovered that everyone beat me, regardless of race, color, or religion. I was simply the most appallingly bad chess player who ever lived, and, as time went on, I just stopped playing chess.\\" Despite this, he incorporated chess into his famous story Nightfall and his novel Pebble in the Sky. *Mathematician and fantasy author Lewis Carroll wove chess extensively in his book Through the Looking Glass. Most of the characters are chess pieces participating in a game on a giant board in which each square is about one square mile in size; similar matches played with human pieces on enormous fields often occurred in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. For instance, Carroll's two Queens always run very fast, and his Knight is always falling off one side of his horse--moves similar to their respective pieces' in a real game. Carroll also composed occasional chess problems. *Silent screen comedian Charlie Chaplin devotes two pages of his autobiography to playing chess, with particular focus on the time he was one of twenty Hollywood stars to play simultaneous chess against Sammy Reshevsky (then nine years old) at the Los Angeles Athletic Club in June 1921. * Actor Humphrey Bogart was an excellent chess player, almost of master strength. Before he made any money from acting, he would hustle players for dimes and quarters, playing in New York parks and at Coney Island. The chess scenes in Casablanca had not been in the original script, but were put in at his insistence. A chess position from one of his correspondence games appears in the movie, although the image is a little blurred. He achieved a draw in a simultaneous exhibition given in 1955 at Beverly Hills by the famous chess Grandmaster Samuel Reshevsky and also played against George Koltanowski in San Francisco in 1952 (Koltanowski played blindfolded but still won in 41 moves).\\"The chess games of Humphrey Bogart.\\" Chessgames.com.

Prior to that time, his 1911 Portrait of Chess Players ({portrait de joueurs d'echecs) contained Cubist overlapping frames and multiple perspectives of his two brothers playing chess. He dropped painting in 1923, concentrating on chess and his strength became near master class. Duchamp can be seen, very briefly, playing chess with Man Ray in the short film Entr'acte (1924) by Ren√© Clair. He designed the 1925 Poster for the Third French Chess Championship, and later became a chess journalist, writing weekly newspaper columns. While his contemporaries were achieving spectacular success with art, Duchamp observed, \\"I am still a victim of chess. It has all the beauty of art ‚Äì and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.\\" Later he said \\"while not all artists are chess players, all chess players are artists.\\" Duchamp composed an enigmatic endgame chess problem in 1943, included in the announcement for Julian Lev's gallery exhibition \\"Through the Big End of the Opera Glass\\". It was printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: \\"White to play and win\\". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem with most concluding that there is no solution.Beliavsky, A & Miklahchishin, A Winning Endgame Technique Batsford, 1995 In 1968, Duchamp and John Cage appeared together at a concert entitled \\"Reunion\\", playing a game of chess and composing Aleatoric music by triggering a series of photoelectric cells underneath the chess board. *Mathematician Leonard Euler constructed an 8x8 square with each square containing one of the numbers from 1 to 64.

His autobiography Speak, Memory compares the composition of chess problems to the composition of poetry. In his foreword to The Defense, he calls the creation of surprise twists in a novel \\"chess effects\\". A 1979 study in Yale French Studies explores links between Nabokov's chess problems and his novels, as does Janet Gezari's 1971 Ph.D. thesis 'Game Fiction: The World of Play and the Novels of Vladimir Nabokov', later issued as a book entitled Vladimir Nabokov: chess problems and the novel. *Napoleon is perhaps the most well-known victim of the chess hoax known as The Turk, an apparently mechanical chess-playing machine animated by a player hiding inside. The emperor was visiting Sch√∂nbrunn Palace in Vienna in 1809 and challenged the Turk. In a surprise move, he took the first turn instead of deferring to the Turk, as was usual; the device's then owner, M√§lzel, allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. The Turk simply returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game, as was its habit. Napoleon attempted the same move a second time; the Turk removed the piece from the board entirely and took its turn. When Napoleon persisted a third time, the Turk swept its arm and knocked all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, then played a proper game, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender.Bradley Ewart, Chess: Man vs. Machine (London: Tantivy, 1980). *Though it is unknown how avidly Edgar Allan Poe played chess, an intimate knowledge of the game pervaded an essay and two of his stories. The essay was an important speculation on the secret of the hoax chess-playing automaton The Turk entitled Maelzel's Chess Player. Poe also published a short story in which the Turk figures entitled \\"Von Kempelen and His Discovery\\". The Turk was eventually purchased by Poe's personal physician, John Kearsley Mitchell. Poe's short story \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" contains a discussion of the psychology of chess, arguing that much greater powers of shrewdness are required to play checkers than chess, whereas the latter only requires intense concentration. He also asserts that proficiency in the game of whist is an indicator of high general capacity for achievement, but not proficiency in chess.I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts [checkers] than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. The Murders in the Rue Morgue- Paragraph 1; \\"Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all these more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind.\\" The Murders in the Rue Morgue- Paragraph 2 *Russian composer Serge Prokofiev relates in his autobiography that he learned to play chess at age seven and it remained a lifelong passion.

Local Yemenis work on the committee in coordination with national and international partners to safeguard women's fundamental human rights. The Millennium Development Goals provide the framework guiding the committee's main policy priority areas. History Prime Minister Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani created the Women's National Committee as a technical committee affiliated with the Ministries' Council through act No. 97 in August 1996. In order to show their commitment to empowering women, the Yemeni government expanded the committee's mandate. Prime Minister Abd al-Karim al- Iryani issued act No. 68 in 2000 that established the Supreme Council for Women Affairs. This act also entailed a restructuring of the Women's National Committee and broadening its framework. In effect, the committee became part of the restructured Supreme Council, and today, committee members ultimately answer to the Prime Minister of Yemen. In fact, Yemeni prime ministers often attend workshops and conferences organized by the Women's National Committee of Yemen. Structure The organizational structure of the Women National Committee consists of: =Committee chairperson= The Yemeni President appoints this position to a person whom he entrusts with overall responsibility for Women's National Committee. =Vice chairperson= The prime minister appoints this position to someone who is meant to serve in support of the chairperson and takes over their duties in case of illness or death. =The Heads and Staff of the Specialized Technical Departments= The Women's National Committee has specialized departments generally divided between economic, social, educational, cultural and political fields. =Heads of women departments in ministries, political parties and selected NGOs= The committee also has a presence in women departments throughout local governmental and non-governmental bodies. This helps to facilitate cooperation between the Women's National Committee and other actors working on issues that particularly affect women. =Coordinators in the governorates= The committee has branches in all the governorates of the Yemen, and each governorate selects its own female coordinator. These coordinators play a key role in identifying the challenges to women in their respective regions, which thereby allows the committee to develop policies based on regional needs as opposed to blanket nationwide programs. Mandate The main roles and responsibilities of the Women's National Committee of Yemen are to: * Create plans and strategies related to women and women's issues. * Review governmental budget proposals and prepare proposals to the government to modify legislation and policies to strengthen women's rights. * Monitor the government's role in creating laws and enforcing laws relating to women's rights. * Gather data about women's issues and prepare reports based on this information. * Educate others through conferences, seminars and workshops relating to women's issues. * Carry out other tasks as assigned by the Supreme Council. Current work The committee has been working since 2010 towards amending the constitution of Yemen which states that blood money or restitution for women is only half that of men. This means that if a woman is killed unjustly, her family only receives half the amount of obligatory payment than if a man was killed instead. The committee issued its fourth Five-Year Action Plan on February 22, 2011, which aims to empower Yemeni women in economic, social, educational, cultural and political fields. The report identifies several tangible goals: First, it aims to increase the rate of female employment to 30 percent over the next five years. In 2005, Yemeni women made up 24.6% of the workforce. In particular, the committee seeks to integrate women into four of the most promising economic fields in Yemen, namely fisheries, agriculture, tourism and startup industrial projects. Second, the committee hopes to increase girls‚Äô enrollment in schools from 76 percent in 2008 to 95 percent by 2015. Despite the traditional rights to education granted by Islam, Yemen has a low literacy rate for women. The illiteracy ratio for women in Yemen was at 60% in 2012. Third, the committee discovered 32 Yemeni laws in need of amendment for discriminatory language against women. Fourth, reflecting committee efforts to curtail violence against women, the report cites plans to build ten special houses for battered women and establish new departments in police stations to receive domestic violence reports. Obstacles The committee has identified three main obstacles to the fulfillment of its mission: =Local capacity for implementation= Senior committee officials constantly complain that Yemeni government authorities lack the required ability to implement plans designed to empower women. Committee members suggest that they know what Yemeni women need, the problem is in the government's flawed implementation of policies. Law enforcement has been slow to uphold the law in regard to women. A report issued by the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT) found that law enforcement agencies often do not take domestic violence complaints seriously and, in addition, often blame the victim who is reporting the crime. Some police officers questioned for the report were reported as saying \\"that a respectable woman should tolerate assaults committed against her by family members, particularly by husbands.\\" =Political stability= Yemen has not been immune to the current upheavals across the Arab Middle East. In fact, the situation in Yemen is particularly unstable and has cast a shadow over all Yemeni government initiatives including their work on women's empowerment. Nevertheless, present tensions may offer more opportunities for women if civil war is averted and the parties reach a compromise to establish a reformed government that is more responsive to the needs of its people. It has been difficult to get women's rights activists who have different political ideologies to come together and discuss policies to help women in Yemen. =Extent of the problem= Yemen consistently ranks as the worst country on the World Economic Forum‚Äôs Global Gender Gap reports. This includes the latest 2010 report. For example, according to a 2007 report by the International Centre for Research on Women, 48.4 percent of women under 18 in Yemen were married. The acute situation for women in Yemen leaves the committee with little to build on in its attempt to achieve fairly ambitious goals. If almost half of Yemeni girls are getting married before they turn 18 it complicates committee efforts to convince them to pursue higher education.

A tapu was the equivalent of a title deed for farmland, in a feudal system where farmers were proprietors rather than outright owners; this would be recorded in a tapu tahrir, a survey of land ownership and land grants which the Ottoman government used to update land-tax records, and which are now valuable to historians. Not all land was subject to the tapu system; iltizam tax-farming was more commonly applied to non-tapu land. A prominent 16th-century legal theorist argued that tapu resmi was contrary to shari'ah law, and was effectively a bribe; however, tapu resmi continued to be used across the Ottoman Empire. Tapu resmi was a divani tax on these land titles, payable to the timar holder. Because land inherited land was subject to a change of title, tapu resmi could also be seen as an inheritance tax; but the tapu resmi fee was payable on other transfers too, including when farmland fell vacant because a tenant farmer died or left. After paying tapu resmi, a farmer would still have to pay resm-i √ßift (or an equivalent tax) each year. Land which was newly brought under cultivation, such as ifrazat, would be exempt from tapu resmi until the next tahrir (survey). In 1716, a kanunname (tax code) for the vilayet of Morea set a sliding scale of tapuu resmi fees, from 20 ak√ßes for low-quality land to 60 ak√ße for high-quality land; this was categorised as a bad-i hava tax, along with adet-i de≈ütbani. The tapu system was partially reformed during the tanzimat; including increased gender equality, so that women could work, or rent out, farmland; responsibility for collecting the tapu resmi passed to dedicated treasury officers rather than feudal lords, and documents were standardised in the 1840s.

It is a hybrid between Pelargonium zonale and Pelargonium inquinans. They are the group of Pelargonium cultivars, with leaves marked with a brown annular zone and inflorescence in the form of large balls of tight flowers, usually red, pink or white. These are the most common geraniums of garden centers and florists, sold in pots for windowsills and balconies or planted in flowerbeds. Etymology The specific epithet hortorum is a genitive form of the Latin hortus \\"garden\\" and therefore corresponds to \\"horticultural\\". The name was created by the American botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey who in 1914, writes \\"The large number of forms of the common geranium, derives from the variation and probably the crossing of P. zonale and P. inquinans (and possibly others) during more than a century of careful selections\\". It is important to distinguish the botanical Latin term \\"Geranium\\", the extent of which has varied according to botanical knowledge over the centuries and the vernacular name of the French language \\"geranium\\" whose extension is defined by several centuries of use by amateur and professional gardeners. Furthermore, most plants commonly called \\"geraniums\\" by florists and gardeners do not belong to the genus Geranium (as currently delimited by botanists) but to the genus Pelargonium. Currently, most gardeners, amateur or professional, know perfectly well that the geraniums that decorate the balconies are Pelargonium but they are reluctant to use the term they find too pedantic. The term is not felt to be fully part of the common language and still remains marked as scholarly. History P. zonal (wild) in the background, Pelargonium x hortorum (hybrid) in the foreground The ancestors of Pelargonium zonal group are two species of wild pelargoniums of South Africa called Geranium Africanum. In the following century, Carl Linn√© gave them a binomial name, Geranium zonal and Geranium inquinans (in Species Plantarum 7 , 1735), then the heir reclassified them in the genus Pelargonium. But this name will only be widely accepted in the 19th century, and in the meantime varieties and horticultural hybrids of these species were a great success with gardeners, they kept the habit they had taken to call them \\"geraniums\\", a term that was unambiguously in context. The first ancestor of the zonal group, now known as Pelargonium zonal, was collected in the province of Western Cape in 1689 and was sent to Europe and described by the Dutch botanist 9 Jan Commelijn (1629‚Äì1692). Traces of its cultivation are then found in the gardens of the Duchess of Beaufort in England, an aristocrat passionate about exotic flowers that employed many gardeners to grow seeds brought back by sailors from abroad. In 1699 she produced a catalog of her collection of plants which she had the following year illustrated by artists. Among the paintings are what is now called Pelargonium zonal whose precise identification was made by the botanist John Ray. It was only during the second half of the 18th century that the foundations of hybridization and floral biology began to be established through the work of two remarkable German experimenter Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel (1750‚Äì1816). With the first, the technique of obtaining first and second generation hybrids is described for the first time. In 1793, Sprengel established that most hermaphroditic flowers could not be fertilized by their own pollen because their reproductive organs did not reach maturity at the same time (as is the case with Geraniaceae). And we had to wait for the precise observations of the Italian microscopist Giovanni Battista Amici in 1830, to establish that the pollen germs by emitting a pollen tube that progresses to the egg. Geranium doubles. The first traces of the culture of the second ancestor of the zonal group, now known as Pelargonium inquinans , are not found in a duchess but in a bishop, who is also passionate about plants coming from overseas. Henry Compton , Bishop of London, had been a botanical collection in the garden of Fulham Palace. In 1713, when he died, Pelargonium inquinans was found in his collection. The first illustration from 1732 was made from a plant growing in the garden of British botanist James Sherard. =Popularity= Traditionally, doctors were interested in medicinal plants, but with Dr. John Fothergill (1712‚Äì1780), a great collector of new plants, \\"curious for a scientific mind,\\" he says, gathered with this greed of know the natural objects that was typical of the Age of Enlightenment. His fortune enabled him to employ about fifteen gardeners to maintain a botanical garden in Essex and three to four artists to paint his plants. When he died in 1780, in the inventory of his plants, there is a Fothergill's geranium, later described as having a large ball of flowers and zoned leaves and considered as such one of the first Pelargonium zonal group. Until the middle of the 19th century, England had a monopoly on obtaining by planting varieties zoned delicate colors. At the beginning of the century, few hybridizations in the zonal group were carried out, as far as can be known because the horticulturists reused the same denomination for different plants and did not indicate the kinship of their obtaining. The most important improvements geraniums zoned only became apparent at the end of the 19th century. The exchange of varieties between France and England made it possible to enrich the collections on both sides of the English Channel. The English varieties were valued for their robustness, the French varieties for the beauty of their flowers. Landowners and local notables were passionate about rare and exotic species. During major exhibitions where growers present their latest creations, competitions are organized to award gold medals to outstanding cultivars. All these factors contribute to the craze for geraniums, one of the easiest plants to grow and the most floriferous. The passion for creating new varieties of pelargonium that appeared in England developed throughout Europe by the late 19th century. Description They are stocky and large. The flowers can be single or double, and have five petals positioned regularly around the center. The leaves are often fragrant. The flowers come in many colours, including red, shades of pink, scarlet and white. Recently, orange and yellow cultivars have been developed. The inflorescence is carried by a long rigid peduncle, starting from the armpit of the upper leaves, so that the flowered head stands out clearly above the foliage. Colorful pelargoniums in a balcony Many cultivars have been grown since the late eighteenth century. Cultivars with very double flowers and no anthers are called Rosebud Pelargoniums since the flowers never open completely and therefore resemble a rose. Leaves of circular shape (7 cm in diameter) and have a winged venation and a leaf margin. The blade is covered by a dark annular area, more or less visible depending on the variety. The zoned geraniums are very floriferous plants, not quite demanding when it comes to water. Flowering occurs without interruption from spring until the last days of autumn. Cultivation Flowers. Pelargoniums in various colors Availability includes the usual nursery \\"seed-grown\\" and the \\"cutting grown\\" types, which can easily be propagated at home by cuttings and planting side branches. Bracts on cuttings are to be removed, because they often rot. Rooting continues in good conditions for up to 3 weeks. Recently, there are varieties that can be propagated from seeds. Sown in a sandy substrate, it easily germinates at a temperature of 16‚Äì18¬∞ C. Zonal geraniums grow in U.S. Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 9 through 12. Zonal geraniums are basically tropical perennials and they overwinter in zones as cool as zone 7.Minimum Temperatures for Geranium Plants The whole plant with the exception of flowers gives off a characteristic smell. It blooms for a very long time (throughout the summer) and abundantly, however, most cultivated varieties do not produce seeds. During the year, it grows about 25‚Äì30 cm. It is a long-lived plant, however, older specimens become unkempt, because they are fattening with the bottom of the leaves and bloom less well. It is grown as an ornamental plant, mainly as a potted plant in apartments and in various types of containers on balconies, window sills and, verandas. The advantages of this plant are the long-blooming flowers and decorative leaves. Recently, in the composition with other plant species, it is sometimes also grown as a bed plant. The plant needs strong light and some direct sunlight. It prefers a dry atmosphere and a lot of space. It should not be sprayed, as it causes root rot. The peat soil or loam soil is the best substrate. Tilled in the apartment in the summer tolerates well room temperature, in winter it is better to take it to a colder room with a temperature not exceeding 16¬∞ C. In summer, the plant indoors must be watered 2‚Äì3 times a week, whilst the geraniums growing in the field in full sun must be watered every day, morning or evening.

Biography Anselm Casimir Anselm Casimir Wambold von Umstadt was the son of Eberhard Wambolt Umstadt (1546‚Äì1601) and Anna von Reiffenberg (d. 1583). He was born on 30 November 1582, most likely in Speyer, where his father was an official in the Reichskammergericht. His father had been a Calvinist, but converted to Catholicism in 1581. After being educated by the Jesuits, Anselm Casimir Wambold von Umstadt was admitted to the cathedral chapter of Mainz Cathedral in Mainz in 1596. He spent 1596-97 studying at the Collegium Germanicum in Rome and 1597-99 at the University of W√ºrzburg. He then spent three years studying philosophy and theology in Rome. He returned to Mainz in 1604, and was ordained as a deacon on 11 May 1605, at which time he became a member of the cathedral chapter. He then spent the next two years studying law at the University of Padua. In June 1608, Archbishop of Mainz Johann Schweikhard von Kronberg named him a member of his Hofrat, becoming its president in January 1609, a position he held until 1618. During this period, he often served as the archbishop's representative to members of the Catholic League. In 1619, he became Amtmann of Mombach, a post he held until 1629. He was also rector of the University of Mainz from 1620 to 1624. On 6 August 1629, the Mainz cathedral chapter elected Anselm Casimir Wambold von Umstadt as the new Archbishop of Mainz. Pope Urban VIII confirmed his election on 28 January 1630. With the Thirty Years War raging, on Christmas 1631, forces under Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden occupied Mainz, though the archbishop had already fled to Cologne. The city was recaptured from Swedish forces in December 1635, and the archbishop returned on 22 June 1636. On 22 December 1636, at Regensburg, he crowned Ferdinand III as King of the Romans. In 1644, French troops occupied Mainz, and the archbishop fled to Frankfurt. An ardent supporter of the Catholic position during the Thirty Years War, his intransigence was partially responsible for delaying the signing of the Peace of Westphalia until after his death. After concluding a peace with the French, Anselm Casimir Wambold von Umstadt died in Frankfurt on 9 October 1647. References *This page is based on this page on German Wikipedia.

The methods of pluton emplacement are not yet fully understood, but there are many different proposed pluton emplacement mechanisms. Stoping, diapirism and ballooning are the widely accepted mechanisms. There is now evidence of incremental emplacement of plutons. Stoping Vertical migration of magma is driven by gravity. Stoping occurs when blocks of wall rock material are transferred downward through a pluton. Stoping is an important emplacement mechanism in a variety of tectonic settings and has been widely used to explain discordant pluton contacts. The most common signatures of stoping are sharp discordant contacts between plutons and wall rocks and a lack of ductile deformation of the wall rocks. Other characteristics of stoping include the presence of xenoliths in the plutons, evidence for the rotation of xenoliths and geochemical evidence of magma contamination. =Structural relations around stoped blocks= Igneous minerals within a pluton can record deformation history. Therefore, it is useful to understand magmatic fabrics for understanding pluton emplacement. Experimental work done on rocks has helped with establishing a relationship between the rheology and deformation mechanisms on magma. The setbacks encountered are foliation and lineation can be produced by a number of different processes, magmatic strains can be decoupled from the host rocks, and strains and timing the exact time of fabric formation with a particular pluton ascent mechanism is difficult. Magmatic foliations and mafic enclaves usually indicate radially increasing strains normal to the pluton contact and extensional strains parallel to it. Magmatic fabrics will not record information of the stoping process as they are only formed near the end of the pluton emplacement. Furthermore, any magmatic fabrics that are recorded are likely to be affected by strain. Therefore, the causes of the magmatic fabrics may not be discernable, and at best can only give inferences to the mechanisms for emplacement of the pluton, or magma chamber internal mechanisms. =Problems with stoping as an emplacement process= In order for a magma body of a certain volume (V) to ascend by stoping by a distance equal to its height (H), a volume of wall rocks equivalent to its volume (V) must sink through the magma. For that reason, for stoping to be an important magma ascent process, plutons should contain large volumes of xenoliths; The floors of plutons such as the Lookout Peak pluton, the Tinemaha pluton and a number of plutons around the world lack an abundance of xenoliths. If stoping is a significant process there should be abundant xenoliths found. Daly who proposed the theory of stoping argued that it is an efficient process because large blocks can sink rapidly because of the quadratic dependence on sinking velocity. Given the size of the blocks sinking, there should be abundant small fragments produced by natural fragmentation, however there is a paucity of small fragments at pluton margins and this is inconsistent with stoping. Another drawback of stoping is it cools too rapidly and occurs too slowly for low density crustal rocks. There is also not a lot of evidence for forceful lateral emplacement with sufficient strain to make room for the ascending pluton. Incremental emplacement There is growing evidence that large homogenous plutons grew incrementally, frequently as sill (geology). Sheeted intrusions are recognizable worldwide. Evidence suggests that steeply dipping sheets at the margins of some plutons were emplaced sub horizontally and then tilted at the margin of a sagging floor. It is thought that plutons are fed by dikes and have grown by this process. This is evident in McDoogle pluton in the Sierra Nevada; this pluton is compositionally layered parallel to its contacts and contains numerous thin concordant panels of wall rock. Ascent by stoping is less feasible with incremental emplacement because if the active magma body is below the top of a pluton, stoping rearranges material within the pluton and produces no overall ascent. To reach a position at the top of the older increments, an increment would have to stop its way upward through all previous increments. The rheology of host rock plays a key role: hard rock will be able to stop magma ascent Magma emplacement occurs as pulses, with repose time. If intrusion rate is high enough, the different pulses may mix, with their individual contacts being lost. Pulses are grouped into batches, sub-units and units, forming a pluton. Ballooning Ballooning is an emplacement mechanism used to describe the in situ inflation of the magma chamber of roughly spherical plutons. In this proposed model, the magma rises until it loses heat and its outermost margin crystallizes, the hotter tail of the magma continues to ascend and expand the already crystallized outer margin. Diapirism Diapirism occurs when a hot fluid mass of magma moves by softening a thin region of wall rock nearest to the body.Marsh, D. B. 1984, On the mechanics of Igneous Diapirism, Stoping and Zone melting, American Journal of Science v. 282 p 808 ‚Äì 855 It is thought to be limited to the mantle and lower crust which have high temperatures and ductile rocks. In order for plutons to ascend, room must be made for them, but the general mechanisms are uncertain. A question that is most commonly asked is what happened to the rock occupying the space now occupied by the pluton? A viable method proposed to make room from ascending magma is a zone of lateral extension which can be found at mid ocean ridges, strike slip faults and dilational jogs (areas of tension along a fault offset). A problem with this method is that the extension rates are too slow and the slip magnitudes are too small to allow a magma chamber to form by intrusion of magma by the extension rate.

It is a two-story stone building erected in the late 19th century. At different stages in the city's history, it was owned by an entrepreneur who used the building in a way that redefined the city for that time. In 1985, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built by David Marks Hyman, one of the earliest investors in silver mining during Aspen's early years; it is the only building in Aspen he is known to have financed. Originally home to a bank, it was one of the largest commercial blocks built during the city's boomtown period. Later it was used for several car-related businesses, including a dealership and drive-through gas station in the corner where the bank lobby had once been. In 1971 local entrepreneur Harley Baldwin saved it from demolition, and along with the neighboring Collins Block later renovated it into an area now known as \\"Glitter Gulch\\". Today it is home to some upscale boutiques and art galleries. Building The building is located at the southwest corner of the intersection, on the opposite corner from Aspen City Hall, also listed on the National Register. To the west along East Hopkins is another Register-listed property, the Collins Block. The neighborhood is urban and densely developed, with a mixture of historic and sympathetic modern two- and three-story commercial buildings predominating. Structurally it has brick walls, faced in heavily rusticated peachblow sandstone. It is two stories in height. A single-bay clipped corner entrance divides two street facades, 12 bays on the Galena frontage and 10 on Hopkins. Two full-height pilasters separate the corner bay and the two-bay portions on either side. Along Hopkins the next section is a single bay, then two each in the next three sections and another pilaster at the corner. The Galena facade has three in the next section, above the Gucci boutique. A narrow single bay is followed by two three-bay sections with the same treatment. Most of the street level is devoted to retail storefronts, their entrances covered in awnings. A Dior boutique occupies the corner space, with Gucci on either side. An art gallery occupies the space to the south of Gucci along Galena. Fenestration on the upper story consists of one-over-one double- hung sash windows. The five on the Hopkins side, and the first four on Galena, are taller and have taller upper panes. The corner window is topped with a semicircular plaque with \\"BRAND BLDG. 1891 ASPEN COLO.\\" lettered on it. Above the second story, is a double modillioned cornice in three courses, higher in the middle where the roof has a parapet. Behind it is an open-air rooftop cafe, with umbrellas over the tables. A flagpole stands above the corner. The interior of the building is given over to the stores on the first floor with hotel rooms on the second, many of which retain some of the original woodwork. Inside the Dior boutique the bank vault and door from the bank originally in that space remain. The door has its original artistic decoration. History David Marks Hyman, a Bavarian-born Harvard-educated Cincinnati lawyer, came to Aspen in the early 1880s to take more direct control of silver mines friends of his had invested his money in. He became one of the richest citizens of the emerging community, building a fortune from the Colorado Silver Boom. Like fellow early Aspen mining entrepreneur Jerome B. Wheeler, his rival and adversary in a bitter legal battle over one particularly rich silver lode, he made his statement with large buildings bearing his name. The Hyman Building was faced in the same peachblow sandstone as Wheeler's Opera House, brought to the city by the railroads that Hyman and Wheeler had briefly put aside their differences to bring up the Roaring Fork Valley in the late 1880s. The Hyman was one of the largest commercial buildings erected in Aspen during the early mining boom. Built for $30,000 ($ in modern dollars), it rivaled in size and prestige the Aspen Block to the south, built by D.R.C. Brown, another major early developer of the city. Both the Aspen and the Hyman shared the same major tenant: the First National Bank of Aspen. In the Hyman it occupied the corner suite. The bank was known in its time for serving lavish lunches with fine wines. Other retail tenants included jewelers and a grocery store. The upper space had some offices but was mostly given over to a meeting hall of the Patriotic Order Sons of Liberty. The bank's presence and the building's dominant position within the city helped it survive after the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in response to the Panic of 1893 brought an end to the boom years of early Aspen. The metal's price collapsed to market levels once the federal government was no longer required to purchase it, and the city's population steadily declined. Many smaller buildings from the boom years stood vacant and abandoned, their neglect leaving them victim to fire and the effects of Aspen's severe and lengthy high-altitude winters. The order's former meeting room was a popular venue for local dance events. Another entrepreneur, Michael H. Brand, bought the building in the 1920s. He adapted it for use to serve the growing population of automobile users, a mode of transportation then making its presence felt in the remote mountain town, its population by then a historic low of less than a thousand. As in the Aspen Block, the corner space was converted into a service station. The onetime bank lobbies had the only ceilings high enough for trucks to fit under and shelter them from snowfall. Other spaces were given over to a dealership and repair shop. After World War II, another owner took over the gas station. Aspen gradually became one of the first ski resorts in the Western United States, and its economy improved. The Aspen Music Festival used the meeting hall space for orchestra rehearsals in the 1950s, before it developed its own facilities outside of town. The Hyman‚ÄìBrand began to feel the effects of time and its radical conversion several decades earlier. By 1970 the gas station was no longer a viable business, and the building was condemned and slated for demolition. The following year it was saved when Harley Baldwin bought it for $170,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). A man in his mid-20s who had driven out to Aspen from the East after college and established a business selling cr√™pes which he then parlayed into real estate, Baldwin restored the Hyman‚ÄìBrand and leased it out as a retail space. A few years later, Baldwin returned to New York City and devoted most of his time and energy to real estate there. In 1988 he returned to Aspen and bought the Collins Block next door. He began to transform both properties into visible symbols of Aspen's cachet among the international rich and famous, easing out longtime tenants like a hardware store in favor of upscale fashion retailers like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Gucci. Baldwin opened the art gallery that still bears his name in the building as well. The upper story of the Hyman‚ÄìBrand became the exclusive Aspen Hotel, where guests had membership privileges at the exclusive Caribou Club in the basement of the Collins Block The area became known as \\"Glitter Gulch\\", a nickname that soon also came to be used for Aspen as a whole. Some residents lamented the open acknowledgement of Aspen's association with celebrity and wealth, recalling the days of the early 1970s when the city's lack of pretense had so attracted those visitors in the first place, and they mixed freely with locals. Baldwin saw it as simply inevitable. \\"Aspen is for the most successful people in the world. It so happens that they like to wear Gucci. Where's the problem?\\" he told Vanity Fair in 2001. When he died in 2005, shortly after Louis Vuitton announced it would move to larger quarters on Mill Street,Dior now occupies its former space at the corner. the Hyman‚ÄìBrand was estimated to be worth as much as $15 million.

This scenario has been changing slowly as dependency and trust on ECAI is growing stronger. Bank loan exposure rating in Bangladesh Financing in Bangladesh economy is more bank loan oriented compared to capital market or bond market. Clients prefer availing banking facilities to finance their business for its easy accessibility and business- friendly relationship. In addition, the private sector is more \\"private limited\\", company oriented and structurally accessible to capital market for private limited companies is not open. Therefore, these companies are not required to go through stringent regulatory compliance to get finance. However, commercial banks are required to assess risk in standard format against all loans before the same is sanctioned. Considering the increase in risk in all economic sectors due to various reasons, the central bank asked all commercial banks to assess the client risk and tie the same with its capital adequacy requirement. This risks are to be assessed by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI) as recognized by the Bangladesh Bank under Basel II Capital Adequacy framework. The 'Capital Adequacy' for bank simply means, a bank must have adequate capital for risk absorption that are arising from various risks including financing. Under Basel II Capital adequacy framework as adopted by Bangladesh Bank vide Circular No 9 dated 31 December 2008 and subsequently revised on December 29, 2010, the risk weight is to be carried out on the basis of the ratings of ECAI. If loans are not rated, for Tk 100 corporate exposure/loan, the risk weighted assets would be Tk. 125 (125% of the exposure) which translates to 12.5% capital requirement. The above is only in respect of credit risk. Bangladesh Bank also asked the scheduled banks to maintain capital for Operational Risk as well as for Market Risk. The above Bangladesh Bank circular warrants the banks to have more capital compared to the present amount in the bank reserves. Therefore, banks will be required to rate its loan portfolio by recognized rating agencies in order to keep the capital requirement lower.

One source defines death anxiety as a \\"feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to 'be'\\".Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: Also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), death anxiety is distinguished from necrophobia, which is a specific fear of dead or dying people and/or things; the latter is the fear of others who are dead or dying, whereas the former concerns one's own death or dying.The American Heritage¬Æ Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ¬©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company Additionally, there is anxiety caused by death-recent thought-content, which might be classified within a clinical setting by a psychiatrist as morbid and/or abnormal, which for classification pre-necessitates a degree of anxiety which is persistent and interferes with everyday functioning. Lower ego integrity, more physical problems and more psychological problems are predictive of higher levels of death anxiety in elderly people perceiving themselves close to death. Death anxiety can cause extreme timidness with a person's attitude towards discussing anything to do with death. Types Robert Langs distinguishes three types of death anxiety:http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html = Predatory death anxiety = Predatory death anxiety arises from the fear of being harmed. It is the most basic and oldest form of death anxiety, with its origins in the first unicellular organisms' set of adaptive resources. Unicellular organisms have receptors that have evolved to react to external dangers, along with self- protective, responsive mechanisms made to increase the likelihood of survival in the face of chemical and physical forms of attack or danger. In humans, predatory death anxiety is evoked by a variety of danger situations that put one at risk or threaten one's survival. Predatory death anxiety mobilizes an individual's adaptive resources and leads to a fight-or-flight response: active efforts to combat the danger or attempts to escape the threatening situation. = Predation or predator = Predation or predator death anxiety is a form that arises when an individual harms another, physically and/or mentally. This form of death anxiety is often accompanied by unconscious guilt.Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books This guilt, in turn, motivates and encourages a variety of self-made decisions and actions by the perpetrator of harm to others.McDonald.Hilgendorf. Death imagery and death anxiety. Journal of Clinical Psychology. 1996. p88 = Existential = Existential death anxiety stems from the basic knowledge that human life must end. Existential death anxiety is known to be the most powerful form. It is said that language has created the basis for existential death anxiety through communicative and behavioral changes. Other factors include an awareness of the distinction between self and others, a full sense of personal identity, and the ability to anticipate the future. Awareness of human mortality arose some 150,000 years ago. In that extremely short span of evolutionary time, humans have fashioned a single basic mechanism through which they deal with the existential death anxieties this awareness has evoked‚Äîdenial. Denial is effected through a wide range of mental mechanisms and physical actions, many of which go unrecognized. While denial can be adaptive in limited use, excessive use is more common and is emotionally costly. Denial is the root of such diverse actions as breaking rules, violating frames and boundaries, manic celebrations, directing violence against others, attempting to gain extraordinary wealth and power‚Äîand more. These pursuits are often activated by a death-related trauma, and while they may lead to constructive actions, more often than not, they lead to actions that are damaging to self and others.  Theories =Thanatophobia= Sigmund Freud hypothesized that people express a fear of death, called thanatophobia. He said he saw this as a disguise for a deeper source of concern. It was not actually death that people feared, because in Freud's view nobody believes in their own death. The unconscious does not deal with the passage of time or with negations, which does not calculate amount of time left in one's life. Furthermore, that which one does fear cannot be death itself, because one has never died. People who express death-related fears, actually are trying to deal with unresolved childhood conflicts that they cannot come to terms with or express emotion towards. The name Thanatophobia is made from the Greek figure of death known as Thanatos. =Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair= Developmental psychologist Erik Erikson formulated the psychosocial theory that explained that people progress through a series of crises as they grow older. The theory also envelops the concept that once an individual reaches the latest stages of life, they reach the level he titled as \\"ego integrity\\". Ego Integrity is when one comes to terms with their life and accepts it. It was also suggested that when a person reaches the stage of late adulthood they become involved in a thorough overview of their life to date. When one can find meaning or purpose in their life, they have reached the integrity stage. In opposition, when an individual views their life as a series of failed and missed opportunities, then they do not reach the ego integrity stage. Elders that have attained this stage of ego integrity are believed to exhibit less of an influence from death anxiety. =Terror management theory= Ernest Becker based this theory on existential views which turned death anxiety theories towards a new dimension. It said that death anxiety is not only real, but also it is people's most profound source of concern. He explained the anxiety as so intense that it can generate fears and phobias of everyday life‚ÄîFears of being alone or in a confined space. Based on the theory, many of people's daily behavior consist of attempts to deny death and to keep their anxiety under strict regulation. As an individual develops mortality salience, i.e. becomes more aware of the inevitability of death, they will instinctively try to suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions. =Being, time and Dasein= Martin Heidegger, the German philosopher, on the one hand showed death as something conclusively determined, in the sense that it is inevitable for every human being, while on the other hand, it unmasks its indeterminate nature via the truth that one never knows when or how death is going to come. Heidegger does not engage in speculation about whether being after death is possible. He argues that all human existence is embedded in time: past, present, future, and when considering the future, we encounter the notion of death. This then creates angst. Angst can create a clear understanding in one that death is a possible mode of existence, which Heidegger described as \\"clearing\\". Thus, angst can lead to a freedom about existence, but only if we can stop denying our mortality (as expressed in Heidegger's terminology as \\"stop denying being-for- death\\"). =Meaning management theory= Paul T. P. Wong's work on the meaning management theory indicates that human reactions to death are complex, multifaceted and dynamic. His \\"Death Attitude Profile\\" identifies three types of death acceptances as Neutral, Approach, and Escape acceptances. Apart from acceptances, his work also represents different aspects of the meaning of death fear that are rooted in the bases of death anxiety. The ten meanings he proposes are finality, uncertainty, annihilation, ultimate loss, life flow disruption, leaving the loved ones, pain and loneliness, prematurity and violence of death, failure of life work completion, judgment and retribution centered. =Other theories= Other theories on death anxiety were introduced in the late part of the twentieth century. The existential approach, with theorists such as Rollo May and Viktor Frankl, views an individual's personality as being governed by the continuous choices and decisions in relation to the realities of life and death.Schacter, Daniel L. \\"Psychology\\" 2011. Chapter 12, page 488. Another approach is the regret theory which was introduced by Adrian Tomer and Grafton Eliason. The main focus of the theory is to target the way people evaluate the quality and/or worth of their lives. The possibility of death usually makes people more anxious if they feel that they have not and cannot accomplish any positive task in the life that they are living. Research has tried to unveil the factors that might influence the amount of anxiety people experience in life. =Personal meanings of death= Humans develop meanings and associate them with objects and events in their environment which can provoke certain emotions. People tend to develop personal meanings of death which could be either positive or negative. If the formed meanings about death are positive, then the consequences of those meanings can be comforting (for example, ideas of a rippling effect left on those still alive). If the formed meanings about death are negative, they can cause emotional turmoil. Depending on the certain meaning one has associated with death, positive or negative, the consequences will vary accordingly. =Religiosity= The thought of death may cause different degrees of anxiety for different individuals, depending on many factors. A 2012 study involving Christian and Muslim college-students from the US, Turkey, and Malaysia found that their religiosity correlated positively with an increased fear of death. Other studies have found that a strong sense of religion in a person's life can relate to a lower sense of anxiety towards death. Although there has been no association discovered between religiosity and death anxiety, it has also been shown that death anxiety tends to be lower in individuals who regularly attend religious meetings or gatherings. A 2010 study asked one hundred and sixty-five church participants to fill out the \\"Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale, the Revised Death Anxiety Scale\\" and the results were analyzed using factor analyses, Pearson correlation, and linear and quadratic regression. All found an inverse relationship between intrinsic religious motivation and death anxiety. This suggested that the more religious a person is, the less anxious they may be about death, possibly associating it with an expected afterlife. The study also found that gender did not have an effect on religiosity and total death anxiety.Wen, Ya-Hui. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning6. 2 (Dec 2010): 31-37. A 2017 review of the literature found that in the US, both the very religious and the not-at-all religious enjoy a lower level of death anxiety and that a reduction is common with old age. A 2019 study further examined the aspect of religiosity and how it relates to death and existential anxiety through the application of supernatural agency. Children The earliest documentation of the fear of death has been found in children as young as age 5. Psychological measures and reaction times were used to measure fear of death in young children. Recent studies that assess fear of death in children use questionnaire rating scales. There are many tests to study this including The Death Anxiety Scale for Children (DASC) developed by Schell and Seefeldt. However the most common version of this test is the revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children (FSSC-R). The FSSC-R describes specific fearful stimuli and children are asked to rate the degree to which the scenario/item makes them anxious or fearful. The most recent version of the FSSC-R presents the scenarios in a pictorial form to children as young as 4. It is called the Koala Fear Questionnaire (KFQ). The fear studies show that children's fears can be grouped into five categories. One of these categories is death and danger. This response was found amongst children age 4 to 6 on the KFQ, and from age 7 to 10. Death is the most commonly feared item and remains the most commonly feared item throughout adolescence. A study of 90 children, aged 4‚Äì8, done by Virginia Slaughter and Maya Griffiths showed that a more mature understanding of the biological concept of death was correlated to a decreased fear of death. This may suggest that it is helpful to teach children about death (in a biological sense), in order to alleviate the fear.  Relationship to adult attachment  There has been much literature that supports the existence of a correlation between one's state of coping skills, mental health, emotions and cognitive reactions to stressful events, and one's ability to regulate affect concerning one's death anxiety. A series of tests determined that significantly high levels of death anxiety tend to occur in close relationships with an intimate partner (more so amongst females than males).Beggs, J. R.The relationship between adult attachment style and death anxiety as related to a romantic partner. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 5231.  Sexes  The connection between death anxiety and one's sex appears to be strong. Studies show that females tend to have more death anxiety than males. Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60. The Death Anxiety Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men. Moreover, researchers believe that age and culture could be major influences in why women score higher on death anxiety scales than men. Through the evolutionary period, a basic method was created to deal with death anxiety and also as a means of dealing with loss. Denial is used when memories or feelings are too painful to accept and are often rejected. By maintaining that the event never happened, rather than accepting it, allows an individual more time to work through the inevitable pain. When a loved one dies in a family, denial is often implemented as a means to come to grips with the reality that the person is gone. Closer families often deal with death better than when coping individually. As society and families drift apart so does the time spent bereaving those who have died, which in turn leads to negative emotion and negativity towards death. Women, who are the child bearers and are often the ones who look after children hold greater concerns about death due to their caring role within the family. It is this common role of women that leads to greater death anxiety as it emphasize the 'importance to live' for her offspring. Although it is common knowledge that all living creatures die, many people do not accept their own mortality, preferring not to accept that death is inevitable, and that they will one day die. Age  It is during the years of young adulthood (20 to 40 years of age) that death anxiety most often begins to become prevalent. However, during the next phase of life, the middle age adult years (40‚Äì64 years of age), death anxiety peaks at its highest levels when in comparison to all other age ranges throughout the lifespan. Surprisingly, levels of death anxiety then slump off in the old age years of adulthood (65 years of age and older). This is in contrast with most people's expectations, especially regarding all of the negative connotations younger adults have about the elderly and the aging process (Kurlychek & Trenner, 1982).  Measuring  There are many ways to measure death anxiety and fear. Katenbaum and Aeinsberg (1972) devised three propositions for this measurement. From this start, the ideologies about death anxiety have been able to be recorded and their attributes listed. Methods such as imagery tasks to simple questionnaires and apperception tests such as the Stroop test enable psychologists to adequately determine if a person is under stress due to death anxiety or suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The Lester attitude death scale was developed in 1966 but not published until 1991 until its validity was established. By measuring the general attitude towards death and also the inconsistencies with death attitudes, participants are scaled to their favorable value towards death.

Published on 16 November 2010 by Scribner, it won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction: the jury called it \\"an elegant inquiry, at once clinical and personal\\". The Guardian wrote that 'Mukherjee manages to convey not only a forensically precise picture of what he sees, but a shiver too, of what he feels.'https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/23/emperor-maladies- biography-cancer-siddhartha-mukherjee-review  Content  The book weaves together Mukherjee's experiences as a hematology/oncology fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital as well as the history of cancer treatment and research. Mukherjee gives the history of cancer from its first identification 4,600 years ago by the Egyptian physician Imhotep. The Greeks had no understanding of cells, but they were familiar with hydraulics. Hippocrates thus considered illness to be an imbalance of four cardinal fluids: blood, black bile, yellow bile, phlegm. Galen applied this idea to cancer, believing it to be an imbalance of black bile. In 440 BCE, the Greek historian Herodotus recorded the first breast tumor excision of Atossa, the queen of Persia and the daughter of Cyrus, by a Greek slave named Democedes. The procedure was believed to have been successful temporarily. Galen's theory was later challenged by the work of Andreas Vaselius and Matthew Baille, whose dissections of human bodies failed to reveal black bile. In the 19th century, surgeons devised various approaches to remove tumors, like William Halsted and the radical mastectomy. Additionally, Emil Grubbe used X-rays to treat cancer thus identifying another treatment modality. Rudolph Virchow first observed leukemia, and Franz Ernst Christian Neumann localized the pathology to the bone marrow. In the 20th century, cancer became the second most common cause of death after heart disease in the United States. Sidney Farber induced temporary remission in pediatric leukemia using antifolates developed by Yellapragada Subbarow. Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman also used nitrogen mustard to treat lymphoma. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) introduced clinical trials to test the efficacy of chemotherapy. Recognizing the possibility for a cure, Farber sought funding for his efforts through The Jimmy Fund and Mary Lasker. Inspired by the Space Race, Farber and Lasker appealed to the nation and President Nixon to enact legislation for the War on Cancer, resulting in the passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971 and increased funding for the NCI. The book also reviews the origins of hospice and palliative medicine and cancer screening. According to Mukherjee, the book was a response to the demand of a patient: \\"I‚Äôm willing to go on fighting, but I need to know what it is that I‚Äôm battling.\\" Mukherjee states that two of his influences for the book were Randy Shilts' And the Band Played On and Richard Rhodes' The Making of the Atomic Bomb, but the defining moment for him was \\"when he conceived of his book as a biography\\". It was described, by the magazine TIME, as one of the 100 most influential books of the last 100 years, and by The New York Times magazine as among the 100 best works of non-fiction. = Chapters = # OF BLACKE CHOLOR, WITHOUT BOYLING: Early understandings of cancer # AN IMPATIENT WAR: Chemotherapy and other modern (20th century) forms of treatment # WILL YOU TURN ME OUT IF I CAN'T GET BETTER: Failures of treatments and dominant theories; paradigm shifts in the 1970s # PREVENTION IS THE CURE: Preventive medicine applied to cancer in the United States # A DISTORTED VERSION OF OUR NORMAL SELVES: The cellular nature of cancer # THE FRUITS OF LONG ENDEAVORS: A review on the contemporary state-of-the-art and the victories from a long line of research The epilogue, \\"Atossa's War,\\" discusses prognosis and the ultimate goals of cancer treatment.

Van Gogh made at least four paintings of butterflies and one of a moth. The metamorphosis of the caterpillar into a butterfly was symbolic to Van Gogh of men and women's capability for transformation. Butterflies and moths Butterflies and moths, in the insect order Lepidoptera, are distinguished generally in several ways: Butterflies are brighter in color and fly in the day. Butterfly wings are not linked and fold together when they are in a resting position. On the other hand, moths are generally duller in color, fly at night and have linked wings. There are some exceptions, though, such as a few types of colored moths. Butterflies as a subject Butterflies are found in art and literature, often as symbols of freedom, transformation and life. Van Gogh used butterflies in his works as a symbol of hope. One of his favorite metaphors was about transformative possibilities. In a letter to his sister Wil, Van Gogh says that like a grub eats salad roots, unknowing of the transformation that will take it to a beetle, we are not aware of our potential for metamorphosis. Similarly, he as a \\"painter ought to paint pictures; possibly something else will come after that.\\" Of prostitutes, such as those he met at brothels, Van Gogh wondered of any woman who fell into a life of degradation: \\"She is seeking, seeking, seeking -- does she herself know what? Might she be transformed one day like a grub into a butterfly?\\" That hope may have been on Van Gogh's mind when he took in pregnant Sien Hoornik, a prostitute, and her daughter when he lived in The Hague in 1882. In a letter to his friend √âmile Bernard, Van Gogh uses the miracle of transformation from caterpillar to butterfly to consider what possibilities may be available in the universe: \\"However, since nothing confutes the assumption that lines and forms and colours exist on innumerable other planets and suns as well, we are at liberty to feel fairly serene about the possibilities of painting in a better and different existence, an existence altered by a phenomenon that is perhaps no more ingenious and no more surprising than the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly or of a grub into a maybug. The existence of a painter-butterfly would be played out on the countless celestial bodies which, after death, should be no more inaccessible to us than the black dots on maps that symbolize towns and villages are in our earthly lives.\\" When in need of solace, nature is where Van Gogh went to find peace. In a letter to his sister Wilhelmina he writes that he finds to calm down it's best to \\"look at a blade of grass, the branch of a fir tree, an ear of wheat. So if you want to do, as the artists do, go look at the red and white poppies with their bluish leaves, their buds soaring on gracefully bent stems.\\" Paintings made in Arles Van Gogh came to Arles in southern France when he was about 35 years of age. There he began producing some of his best work. The sunflower paintings, some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time. This is likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life. He is confident, clear-minded and seemingly content. In a letter to his brother, Theo, he wrote, \\"Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle - more like music and less like sculpture - and above all, it promises color.\\" As a means of explanation, Van Gogh explains that being like music means being comforting. =Grass and Butterflies= Grass and Butterflies, made in Arles, is part of a private collection. File:Van Gogh - Rasenst√ºck mit Schmetterlingen.jpegGrass and Butterflies (b/w photo) April, 1889 Private collection (F460) File:Van Gogh - Zwei wei√üe Schmetterlinge.jpegTwo White Butterflies Spring 1889 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F402) =Two White Butterflies= Fascinated by butterflies at a young age, Vincent Dethier became an entomologist. In tribute to him on his seventieth birthday, Miriam Rothschild expressed her appreciation metaphorically through Van Gogh's painting: \\"Two white butterflies twirling in freedom and winged delight. For me they are the symbol of daydreaming ‚Äî the poetry that Vince Dethier insinuates so cunningly into our factual information and knowledge. For the gift, of these special white butterflies ‚Äî along with all your official and unofficial students, past, present and future ‚Äî Vince Dethier, I tender you my most heartfelt and grateful thanks.\\" Another interpretation of Two White Butterflies describes fragile white butterflies that fly over a field of turning grass, evoking a sense of foreboding. =Groupings of butterfly and garden paintings= Jennifer Helvey, author of Irises: Vincent van Gogh in the Garden, groups five garden paintings that Van Gogh made in Arles due to stylist similarity. This grouping includes two butterfly paintings: Two White Butterflies and Grass and Butterflies. She found the paintings seem true, natural reflections of gardens, with a top-down perspective. The works in the grouping share a similar color palette and rhythmic brushstrokes. Iris appears, though, to have been subject to greater study: the single plant centered and the brushstrokes of the grass radiating out from the iris.

During that time he was often restricted to working within the asylum's grounds. Within the grounds of the asylum he painted ivy covered trees, lilacs, and irises of the garden. =Green Peacock Moth= In May 1889 Van Gogh began work on Green Peacock Moth which he self- titled Death's Head Moth. The moth, called death's head, is a rarely seen nocturnal moth. He described the large moth's colors \\"of amazing distinction, black, grey, cloudy white tinged with carmine or vaguely shading off into olive green.\\" Behind the moth is a background of Lords-and-Ladies. The size of the moth and plants in the background pull the spectator into the work. The colors are vivid, consistent with Van Gogh's passion and emotional intensity. Van Gogh Museum's title for this work is Emperor Moth. File:WLANL - artanonymous - Nachtpauwoog.jpgGreen Peacock Moth May, 1889 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F610) File:Van Gogh - Klatschmohn und Schmetterlinge.jpegPoppies and Butterflies April‚ÄîMay, 1890 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F748) =Poppies and Butterflies= Debra Mancoff, author of Van Gogh's Flowers, describedPoppies and Butterflies: \\"vivid red poppies and the pale yellow butterflies float on the surface of twisting dark stems and nodding buds, all against a yellow-gold background. Although composed of natural motifs, Van Gogh's layering of pattern in Butterflies and Poppies suggests a decorative quality like that of a textile or a screen.\\" Mancoff compared this study to the Japanese prints he admired. Butterflies and Poppies is an artwork by Vincent Van Gough, Vincent completed the artwork in 1889. Butterflies and poppies was painted onto a canvas with oil paints. Vincent used a lot of layers in Butterflies and Poppies to create an almost textile-like feel. Using very fine brush strokes also helped to create this illusion. Vincent painted his series, Butterflies, in Arles, southern France where he rented ‚Äòthe yellow house‚Äô. Vincent was around 35 years of age, this time is considered his best period for his paintings. Another series created in this region is Sunflower. The painting features two yellow butterflies resting on some red poppies with a pale bluish background. In The Existential Butterfly, a book of poetry about butterflies and nature, Curtis Farmwald wrote of van Gogh's Poppies and Butterflies: :\\"Though it was painted :Years ago in another country :By the troubled Vincent van Gogh, :The painting could have been done :Right here sometime this summer. :I‚Äôve seen red poppies like those :Growing wild just down the road. :Yellow sulphurs like those :Are all over my yard. :Can their beauty still inspire :A troubled soul to survive?\\" Indicating his desire to make the painting, in 1888 Van Gogh mentions hoping to make a better version of butterflies or the field of poppies while in Arles. =Long Grass with Butterflies= London's National Gallery painting Long Grass with Butterflies, also called Meadow in the Garden of Saint-Paul Hospital, is a view of an abandoned garden with tall unkempt grass and weeds on the asylum grounds. The work was made towards the end of his stay in Saint-R√©my. File:Van Gogh - Wiese im Garten des Hospitals Saint- Paul.jpegLong Grass with Butterflies May 1890 National Gallery, London (F672) Lost Butterfly painting In 1888 Van Gogh also worked on a \\"study of dusty thistles, with an innumerable swarm of white and yellow butterflies,\\" but the painting was lost.

He is of Armenian origin. He was a member of the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters between 1968 and 1974, was then imprisoned and tortured under the Saddam Hussein regime, and after release became a leader of the Armenian community in Zakho. He was elected to the Kurdistan national parliament in 2009. Family Bakoyan was born in 1954 in Avzrog Miri, in the north of Kurdistan Region. He was a descendant of the clan Geznakh in Hakkari, today's North Kurdistan (Turkey). He has three sons and one daughter. Political career For the 2009 parliamentary elections in Federal Kurdistan Region, eleven of the 111 seats were reserved for minorities, including Assyrians, Chaldeans, Turkmen and Armenians. Aram Bakoyan was one of the three Armenian candidates who ran in the election campaign and he was elected. Although there were only about 800 Armenians in Kurdistan who had the right to vote at that time, Aram Bakoyan got 4200 votes. His rivals Aertex Morses Sargisyan and Eshkhan Melkon Sargisyan won respectively 2900 and 880 votes. One important reason for the Kurdish support for the Armenian candidates and particularly for Aram Bakoyan, is the fact that he was already well known for his Peshmerga (Kurdish freedom fighter) past. In 1968 he and six other Armenians from Zakho joined the Peshmerga, fighting alongside Kurdish members of the KDP against the Baath regime of Saddam Hussein. In 1974 Bakoyan was injured by a cannon blast in the left shoulder and stayed three months in a hospital in Mahabad, in Kurdistan in Iran. His left arm remained immobilised. After coming back home, in 1977 Bakoyan was sentenced to five years in prison for his political activities. In prison Bakoyan was tortured, as were many other Kurdish political prisoners at that time. In 1979 he was released and he continued to participate actively in political and social life. Bakoyan was elected twice as leader of the Armenian community in Zakho in 1982-1990. Today Aram is member of two committees in the Parliament - the committee for Municipalities and the committee for Housing and Reconstruction. He contributes to the new developments in Kurdistan Region, but he also works to preserve the Armenian cultural heritage and to help the Armenian community.

It is common for this mineral alteration into dolomite to take place due to evaporation of water in the sabkha area. Dolomitization involves substantial amount of recrystallization. This process is described by the stoichiometric equation: 2 CaCO3(calcite) + Mg2+ ‚Üî CaMg(CO3)2(dolomite) + Ca2+ Dolomitization depends on specific conditions which include low Ca:Mg ratio in solution, reactant surface area, the mineralogy of the reactant, high temperatures which represents the thermodynamic stability of the system, and the presence of kinetic inhibitors such as sulfate. If the kinetic inhibitors and high temperatures are compatible, then dolomitization can take place in saline environments above thermodynamic and kinetic saturation with respect to dolomite. This type of environment includes, freshwater and seawater mixing zones, normal saline to hypersaline subtidal environments, schizohaline environments (fluctuating salinity: fresh-water to hypersaline conditions) and hypersaline supratidal environments. When requirements are fulfilled, dolomitization can take place in alkaline environments which are those under the influence of bacterial reduction and fermentation processes, and areas with high input alkaline continental groundwaters. Environments with high temperatures (about 50 ¬∞C) such as subsurface and hydrothermal environments are conducive to dolomitization.

In brief, the continued growth and operation of the agricultural industry in the Okanagan evidently depends on the employment of temporary migrant workers.Tomic, Patricia, Ricardo Trumper, and Luis L. M. Aguiar. \\"Housing Regulations and Living Conditions of Mexican Migrant Workers in the Okanagan Valley, B.C..\\" Canadian Issues, 78-82. Accessed 5 April 2011. In 2009, there were 3,000 Mexican migrant labourers working in the Okanagan. History The racialization of agricultural labour in the Okanagan Valley is not a recent phenomenon. Rather, it has an extensive history that reaches as far back as early settlement by white, predominantly British, colonials in the 1800s.Lanthier, M., and L. Wong. 2002. \\"Ethnic Agricultural Labour in the Okanagan from the 1880s to the 1960s \\" (report). Royal BC Museum. Accessed 10 April 2011. The first settlers in the Okanagan region focused primarily on cattle ranching, switching to fruit production in about the 1890s. It was this switch to fruit production that started the racialization of agricultural labour in the Okanagan, a lasting legacy that has carried on to the present. Part of its beginnings was the directed promotion of Okanagan Valley towards the wealthier British middle class as a very fashionable endeavour. It is through this rather successful promotional scheme that the Okanagan came to be known for its \\"whiteness,\\" an issue that the area continues to be beset with today.Aguiar et al., 131. With the influx of British ‚Äòsettlers‚Äô many with the goal of establishing fruit orchards, migrant seasonal labour became a pressing issue as there were not enough settlers able or willing to do the manual labour involved in harvesting. The settler‚Äôs solution to this issue was to employ those of other ‚Äòraces‚Äô or ethnicities believed by the white population to be better suited to do menial labour, and hence the beginning of the racialization of agricultural labour in the Okanagan was born. There were various waves or periods when people of a certain ethnic category, or ‚Äòrace‚Äô were more heavily employed as agricultural labourers then others, largely reflecting the political climate of the day. The first racialized groups to be employed as agricultural labourers were First Nations people and the Chinese, with First Nations employment beginning around the 1880s to the present and the Chinese from the early 1900s to the 1930s. Local First Nations groups were often used during the harvesting season of June to October, in addition to migrant First Nations from Washington state.Lanthier & Wong, Part IV. After the construction of the railway by Chinese migrant workers, many were left with no work in a foreign land where racist fears severely limited the type of work Chinese migrants could do. It is for this reason that migrant Chinese were segregated into manual agricultural labour until the introduction of the $500 head tax that effectively stemmed further Chinese migration to Canada. When the Chinese and First Nations could no longer fulfil the demands of orchardists, they switched to alternate racialized groups. During the interwar and WWII era these groups were predominantly the Doukhobors and the Japanese. With many young men off to war there was a gap in agricultural labour that needed to be filled. Reluctantly white orchardists opted to use the forced labour of interned Japanese-Canadians and migrant Doukhobor labour. Once the Japanese began to move back to the coast after the war and the Doukhobors began to migrate back to their settlements in the Nelson area, an agricultural labour gap was once again apparent and in need of filling. This time it was the Portuguese who became the next racialized agricultural group in the Okanagan agricultural industry. However, the Portuguese were not nearly as discriminated against as the previous groups had been, largely due to their country of origin, which was less feared and more acceptable to the primarily white settler population in the Okanagan. From about the 1960s when Portuguese agricultural labour began to decline, migrant labour of young \\"Qu√©b√©cois\\"French Canadians began to be prominent in the Okanagan agricultural sector. However, this labour force too eventually waned, leaving yet another agricultural labour gap. This time labour is coming from much farther away, however, many of the same issues that characterized the Racialized labour of the 20th century remain in the migrant labour needs of fruit tree agriculture of the Okanagan. Latin-American migrant workers Over the last decade or so, many Latin American migrant workers began to arrive in British Columbia to work in the agricultural industry. The primary reason for the arrival of workers from as far away as Mexico is to fill the gap the Canadian farm workers refuse or are unable to fill. As a result, Mexican migrant workers face hardships in the Okanagan agricultural industry. These include, but are not limited to, housing, hours of work, employment benefits, and wages. In addition, an agreement between the Canadian and Mexican governments was signed and in accordance to this agreement Mexico is to provide Canada with agricultural workers on a seasonal basis. The period lasts for approximately eight months and occurs annually. =Motivation and perpetuation= Mexican migrant workers come to the Okanagan to work in the agricultural industry as a mere means of survival. While there are Canadians who come from the east to enjoy the weather and, at the same time, work in the orchards, some employers claim that they do not have the same work ethics as the Mexican migrant workers (see Couture, 2009 cited below for an ethnography of the Young Quebec fruit picker phenomenon). Through the agreement between the Canadian and Mexican governments, migrant workers from Mexico travel to Canada to work, however, once in Canada mobility is made very difficult. Therefore, the men and women who undertake the jobs available in the Canadian agricultural industry cannot change jobs in an effort to earn more to support their families back home. =Type of work and industry= Historically migrant agricultural labour was needed in the Okanagan for tree fruit harvesting, mainly from late June to late October. This typically included the starting of harvest with ‚Äúcherries in late June, followed by apricots and peaches in July, the continuation of peaches, prunes, and some varieties of pears in August, pears, apples, grapes in September, and finally more grapes in October‚Äù. Migrant labour is only need during these various harvesting periods for relatively short periods of time. While many of these same fruits continue to be grown in the Okanagan today, a much larger focus has been given to vineyards with the burgeoning of the wine industry in the Okanagan in recent years. Cherries and apple production continue to remain dominant in agricultural production in the Okanagan Valley as well. The migrant workers are assigned to jobs in orchards and vineyards that entail picking, fertilizing and caring for the plants. Also, processing the produce is their task. In other words, the migrant workers in the Okanagan agricultural industry have to perform the tedious jobs that the industry offers. Consequently, these migrant workers are not usually assigned administrative tasks. =Separation of families= There are many problems that Mexican migrant workers face in the agricultural industry in the Okanagan Valley. First, they are separated from their families who are at times difficult to connect with through the use of the telephone. In addition to their low wages earned workers have to purchase phone cards; however, the transportation to and from the store to make that purchase is not easily accessible because workers are located on the outskirts of town where orchards and vineyards are typically located relying solely on the employer for transportation. In the Okanagan Valley, an employer claimed that he would not pay a driver to take only 15 workers to town to pick up personal items. In other words, workers may have to spend their days off on location unless they all decide to go to town at the same time. The other alternative for them to get needed items from shopping areas is by way of foot, often at great distances. Developments in 2010 On 15 June 2010, three hundred Mexicans marched on the Canadian Embassy in Mexico City to protest unfair treatment of Mexican migrant workers in Canada under the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP). According to the United Food and Commercial Workers union, the largest private union in Canada: > Under SAWP, migrant agriculture workers are typically paid minimum wage and > are often subject to working and housing conditions that Canadian residents > would find intolerable. SAWP workers have historically been hesitant to > report dangerous working conditions or hostile employers for fear of being > sent home or blacklisted from returning the next season.UFCW, \\"Migrant > Workers march...\\" Furthermore, the UFCW‚Äôs 2009‚Äì2010 report on the \\"Status of Migrant Farm Workers in Canada\\" found the conditions under which Mexican temporary workers are employed to be unacceptable. ‚ÄúThe denial of human rights should not be the foundation for Canada‚Äôs food supply system‚Äù, said UFCW Canada and AWA president Wayne Hanley. ‚ÄúBut as the report details, that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening to migrant farm workers. Even worse, it‚Äôs happening with the blessing of the federal government which turns a blind eye to the dangers and abuse migrants are forced to accept if they want to keep their jobs.‚ÄùUFCW, \\"2010-2011 Migrant farm workers report published\\".

The name Mithras (Latin, equivalent to Greek \\"ŒúŒØŒ∏œÅŒ±œÇ\\",Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short. A Latin Dictionary) is a form of Mithra, the name of an Iranian god, a point acknowledged by Mithras scholars since the days of Franz Cumont. The Greek form of the name appears in Xenophon's biography of Cyrus, the Cyropaedia,Xenophon, Cyropaedia 7.5.53. Cited in Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon a work written in the fourth century BC. The word Mithra occurs as the name of a praiseworthy being in the Zoroastrian text, the Zend Avesta.E.g. in Avesta: Yasna: 1:3 Avesta: Yasna: 1:11Ware writes that the Romans borrowed the name \\"Mithras\\" from Avestan Mithra. pp. 52‚Äì61. Similar deity names in related Indo-european languages include Mitra, \\"‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§É\\" found in Rig Vedic hymns.E.g. in Rig Veda 3, Hymn 59 In Sanskrit, \\"mitra\\" means \\"friend\\" or \\"friendship\\". In the inscribed peace treaty of c. 1400 BC between Hittites and the Hurrian kingdom of the Mitanni in the area southeast of Lake Van in Armenian Highlands, the form mi-it-ra- appears as the name of a god invoked together with four other divinities as witnesses and keepers of the pact. pp. 301-317. Robert Turcan describes this inscription as \\"the earliest evidence of Mithras in Asia Minor\\". The exact form of a Latin or classical Greek word varies due to the grammatical process of declension. There is archeological evidence that in Latin worshippers wrote the nominative form of the god's name as \\"Mithras\\". However, in Porphyry's Greek text De Abstinentia (Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œ±œÄŒøœáŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒºœàŒ≥œáœâŒΩ), there is a reference to the now-lost histories of the Mithraic mysteries by Euboulus and Pallas, the wording of which suggests that these authors treated the name \\"Mithra\\" as an indeclinable foreign word.. p. 160: \\"The usual western nominative form of Mithras' name in the mysteries ended in -s, as we can see from the one authentic dedication in the nominative, recut over a dedication to Sarapis (463, Terme de Caracalla), and from occasional grammatical errors such as deo inviato Metras (1443). But it is probable that Euboulus and Pallas at least used the name Mithra as an indeclinable (ap. Porphyry, De abstinentia II.56 and IV.16).\\" In later antiquity, the Greek name of Mithras (ŒúŒØŒ∏œÅŒ±œ≤) occurs in the text known as the Mithras Liturgy, part of the Paris Great Magical Papyrus (Paris Biblioth√®que Nationale Suppl. gr. 574); here Mithras is given the epithet \\"the great god\\", and is identified with the sun god Helios. (The reference is at line 482 of the Great Magical Papyrus of Paris. The Mithras Liturgy comprises lines 475 - 834 of the Papyrus.)See the Greek text with German translation in Albrecht Dieterich, Eine Mithrasliturgie, 2nd edition, pp 1-2 There have been different views among scholars as to whether this text is an expression of Mithraism as such. Franz Cumont argued that it isn't;The \\"Mithras Liturgy\\":Text, Translation and Commentary (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003). p.12 Marvin Meyer thinks it is; while Hans Dieter Betz sees it as a synthesis of Greek, Egyptian, and Mithraic traditions.The \\"Mithras Liturgy\\": Text, Translation and Commentary (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003)Richard Gordon, \\"Probably Not Mithras\\", The Classical Review Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 2005), pp. 99-100. The Persian associations of the name Mithras are acknowledged by scholars such as David Ulansey who interpret Roman Mithraism as something new. A scenario discussed by Ulansey is that \\"the Roman cult of Mithras was actually a new religion\\" which \\"borrowed the name of an Iranian god in order to give itself an exotic oriental flavor\\". According to another historian of Mithraism, John R. Hinnells: \\"The god is unique in being worshipped in four distinct religions: Hinduism (as Mitra), in Iranian Zoroastrianism and Manicheism (as Mithra), and in the Roman Empire (as Mithras).\\" Mary Boyce, a researcher of ancient Iranian religions, writes that even though Roman Empire Mithraism seems have had less Iranian content than historians used to think, still \\"as the name Mithras alone shows, this content was of some importance.\\" References Mithraism ","title":"Mithras (name)"},{"id":"31538409","text":"General James Welsh (12 March 1775‚Äì 24 January 1861) was an English officer in the Madras Army of the East India Company. Biography Welsh, son of John Welsh, a Scotsman, was born on 12 March 1775. He obtained a commission as ensign in the army of the East India Company on 22 May 1790, and arrived at Madras on 23 January 1791. He joined the 3rd European Regiment at Vellore, and in November ascended the ghats with Colonel Floyd's detachment to serve in the grand army under Lord Cornwallis. Welsh was promoted to be lieutenant in the 24th Native Infantry on 1 November 1792, and took part with it in the siege of Pondicherry in July and August 1793. Transferred in 1795 to the 9th Native Infantry at Mandura, he served at the capture of Colombo and Ceylon in February 1796, and remained at Point-de-Galle as fort-adjutant until the end of 1798, when he was transferred in the same capacity to Machlipatnam. On 10 December 1799 Welsh was promoted to be captain, and appointed adjutant and quartermaster of the 3rd Native Infantry, which in 1803 formed part of a force under Major-general Arthur Wellesley to operate against the Marathas. He marched with it across India to Poona, and in June took part in the siege of Ahmadnagar. The town (pettah) was successfully stormed on 8 August and after a bombardment the fortress of Ahmadnagar surrendered on 12 August. Welsh served on the staff at the Battle of Argaum (29 November), in the siege and assault (15 December) of Gawilgarh, and led a body of 250 men, after a forced march of , to the capture of Mankarsir on 6 February 1804. He was appointed judge- advocate and assistant surveyor to the Poona subsidiary force, and, marching with it, and took part in the assault and capture of the hill fort at Chandore on 10 August 1804 and the occupation of the hill fort of Dhoorp on 14 October. He commanded a party of 300 men at the capture of the pettah and outworks of the hill fort of Gaulna, on 26 October, and on 13 November proceeded with a small force to open communication through a difficult country, with Surat, where he arrived on 25 November. In December Welsh was sent on a mission to a Bhil chief by an unexplored pass to the northward, and caught a malignant fever which clung to him for many years. On 15 May 1805 Welsh succeeded to the command of his battalion at Poona, continuing to hold his staff appointment until the end of the year, when he marched with his regiment to Palamcottai in the Carnatic, arriving on 27 March. He was in command there on 19 November, when, as the garrison were assembling under arms, he discovered a plot among the native troops to murder all the Europeans at the station. Acting with the greatest promptitude, he seized the ringleaders, disarmed the native soldiers, and expelled the Muslim troops from the fort. He was tried by court-martial for precipitate conduct in having disarmed the native garrison with insufficient cause, but was honourably acquitted on 20 March 1807, and congratulated by government on this vindication of his reputation. However the governor of Madras, Lord William Bentinck qualified his support by adding the general orders on that day that in his opinion \\"To involve the innocent with the guilty, and include in a sweeping implication of guilt, a numerous body of men, on the ground of general suspicion or apprehension, is a mode of proceeding which ‚Ä¶ no just Government can tolerate\\". Welsh was promoted to be major on 22 May 1807, and went home on furlough. rejoining his regiment on 5 February 1809 before the lines of Travancore, where it formed part of a force under Colonel St. Leger, Welsh led the storming party in the successful assault of those formidable defences on the night of 10 February. He was mentioned in despatches, and the court of directors of the East India Company bore high testimony to his services on the occasion, observing that the achievement reflected the utmost credit on Welsh, \\"who led the storming party in a manner that does singular honour to his intrepidity and perseverance\\". cites Political Despatch, 29 Sept. 1809. On 19 February 1809 he led the advance from the south, and was successful in capturing several hill forts, arriving at Trivandrum, the capital of Travancore, on 2 March. In April 1812 he commanded a small force sent to quell a rising in the Wainad, which he accomplished after a month of heavy marching and desultory fighting. He was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel on 25 January 1813, and was appointed deputy judge-advocate-general, residing at Bangalore. On 6 February 1821 Welsh was appointed to command the troops in the provinces of Malabar and Kanara; on 6 May 1823 to command at Vellore; on 23 January 1824 to command in Travancore and Cochin; and on 1 August 1826 to command the Doab field force. He arrived at Belgaum in September, and was immediately engaged with the Resident in measures which were successful in preventing a threatened rising at Kolhapur. Early in 1829 Welsh went to England on furlough. He was promoted to be colonel on 5 June. In the following year he published Military Reminiscences, from a Journal of nearly forty years' Active Service in the East Indies, with over ninety illustrations (2 vols. 8vo, two editions). The work remains useful for its descriptions of places and military incidents in southern India. Welsh did not return to India until his promotion to major-general on 10 January 1837. He was appointed on 1 June to the command of the northern division, Madras presidency, to which was added, in November 1838, the command in Katak. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 9 November 1846, and relinquished his command on 16 February following. On leaving India the governor in council expressed the high sense entertained of the gallantry and zeal which had marked his service of fifty-eight years. He was promoted to be general on 20 June 1854. He died at North Parade, Bath, on 24 January 1861. Family Welsh married at Calcutta, in 1794, Sarah, a daughter of Francis Light, first governor of Prince of Wales Island, Penang, by whom he had numerous offspring.

Its predecessor, AESOP, was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration in 1994 to assist surgeons in minimally invasive surgery. The ZRSS itself was cleared by the FDA seven years later, in 2001. ZEUS had three robotic arms, which were remotely controlled by the surgeon. The first arm, AESOP (Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning), was a voice- activated endoscope, allowing the surgeon to see inside the patient's body. The other two robotic arms mimicked the surgeon's movements to make precise incisions and extractions. ZEUS was discontinued in 2003, following the merger of Computer Motion with its rival Intuitive Surgical; the merged company instead developed the Da Vinci Surgical System. History =AESOP= In the 1990s, Computer Motion was a leading producer of medical robotics, manufacturing systems such as the HERMES Control Center and the SOCRATES Telecollaboration System. Computer Motion conducted its original research developing the AESOP arm under a NASA SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) contract. NASA funded the research in the hope that derivatives of such technology could help service the Space Shuttle in orbit, working on parts of the shuttle where humans cannot easily access or making other delicate repairs or adjustments. AESOP was cleared for use by the FDA in 1994, and it became the first robot to assist in a surgery. AESOP's function is to maneuver an endoscope inside the patient's body during the surgery. The camera moves based on voice commands given by the surgeon. Voice activation of the AESOP arm allows the surgeon to position the camera while also controlling the other two arms of the ZEUS system. The endoscope can also be controlled by a computer which allows for more precise movements and also allows the endoscope to be inserted into the patient through a smaller incision (a key component of minimally invasive surgery). =ZEUS system= The first prototype of the ZEUS was demonstrated in 1995, and tested on animals in 1996. Two years later, in 1998, it carried out its first tubal re-anastomosis procedure, and its first coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) procedure. By 2000, the ZEUS was equipped to hold 28 different surgical instruments, and in 2001 it received FDA approval. In 2003, the ZEUS Robot Surgical System was marketed at $975,000. This was slightly cheaper than the competing Da Vinci system, which sold for $1 million. =Computer Motion vs. Intuitive Surgical= By 2000, Computer Motion had filed eight lawsuits against a rival medical robotics company, Intuitive Surgical, for allegedly infringing on Computer Motion's patents relating to robotic surgery. On March 7, 2003, Computer Motion and Intuitive Surgical merged into a single company. This was partially done to try to end the litigation between the companies, but also to combine their efforts in developing robotic surgical systems to increase the effectiveness of such technology. Soon after merging, the ZEUS was phased out in favor of Intuitive Surgical's Da Vinci system. Features The ZEUS was designed for minimally invasive microsurgery procedures, such as beating heart surgery and endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting (E-CABGTM). The system was also used to initiate more complex procedures, like a mitral valve surgery IDE study. The ZEUS' robotic arms not only mimic the surgeon's hand movements, but also scale down the movement, allowing the surgeon to easily make precise and small cuts. The arms also correct for tremors in a surgeon's hands, which are normal even without fatigue, though a highly trained surgeon will be able to lessen the negative effects. However, some surgeries can last for hours, in which case the surgeon's arms will get tired, and the resulting tremors from fatigue can make the surgeon create false cuts, which can be devastating during a delicate operation. To handle this, the ZEUS is designed to track and nullify these tremors while still responding to the movements/commands of the surgeon's hands. During the surgery, the surgeon sits at the ZEUS console to control the arms. This can also lessen fatigue, because the surgeon is sitting down during the long operation rather than leaning over the patient. The ZEUS is also able to perform remote surgery. Because the surgeon is simply controlling the robotic arms, the surgeon can sit at a ZEUS console remote from where the surgery is actually taking place, and still be able to perform the surgery.

Excavations The Brentwood Library Site is located on a low ridge next to the Harpeth River and a small spring-fed creek. The site was first mentioned by Frederic Ward Putnam as part of a Harvard Peabody Museum Expedition in the 1882, but the exact location was not mentioned. Putnam excavated forty-eight stone box graves at the site. At least one example of a Nashville style shell gorget was found by Putnam during his excavations of an infant's grave, along with a notched-rim bowl, a human effigy hooded bottle and eight marine shell beads. The site was then forgotten until construction for the new Brentwood library in 1997 uncovered a substantial village and associated burial area. =Ceramics= Mississippian culture pottery vessels and sherds found at the site were made with techniques and forms found across the Mississippian world. Common shapes include bowls with notched rim straps and jars with a direct rim. Strap handles were the only closed handle style found, although bifurcate and tabular lugs were sometimes attached. Some sherds were found to be fabric impressed and other examples used a technique known as negative painting, a technique which involved painting the background and allowing the natural buff or grey of the clay to create the positive image. Notable pottery classifications found were examples of Mound Place Incised, Matthews Incised var.

It was derived by William Margrabe (PhD Chicago) in 1978. Margrabe's paper has been cited by over 2000 subsequent articles. Google Scholar's \\"cites\\" page for this article Formula Suppose S1(t) and S2(t) are the prices of two risky assets at time t, and that each has a constant continuous dividend yield qi. The option, C, that we wish to price gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to exchange the second asset for the first at the time of maturity T. In other words, its payoff, C(T), is max(0, S1(T) - S2(T)). If the volatilities of Si 's are œÉi, then textstylesigma = sqrt{sigma_1^2 + sigma_2^2 - 2 sigma_1sigma_2rho}, where œÅ is the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the Brownian motions of the Si 's. Margrabe's formula states that the fair price for the option at time 0 is: :e^{-q_1 T}S_1(0) N(d_1) - e^{-q_2 T}S_2(0) N(d_2) :where: ::q_1,q_2 are the expected dividend rates of the prices S_1,S_2 under the appropriate risk-neutral measure, ::N denotes the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal, ::d_1 = (ln (S_1(0)/S_2(0)) + (q_2 - q_1 + sigma^2/2)T)/ sigmasqrt{T}, ::d_2 = d_1 - sigmasqrt{T}. Derivation Margrabe's model of the market assumes only the existence of the two risky assets, whose prices, as usual, are assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion. The volatilities of these Brownian motions do not need to be constant, but it is important that the volatility of S1/S2, œÉ, is constant. In particular, the model does not assume the existence of a riskless asset (such as a zero-coupon bond) or any kind of interest rate. The model does not require an equivalent risk-neutral probability measure, but an equivalent measure under S2. The formula is quickly proven by reducing the situation to one where we can apply the Black-Scholes formula. *First, consider both assets as priced in units of S2 (this is called 'using S2 as numeraire'); this means that a unit of the first asset now has is worth S1/S2 units of the second asset, and a unit of the second asset is worth 1. *Under this change of numeraire pricing, the second asset is now a riskless asset and its dividend rate q2 is the interest rate. The payoff of the option, repriced under this change of numeraire, is max(0, S1(T)/S2(T) - 1). *So the original option has become a call option on the first asset (with its numeraire pricing) with a strike of 1 unit of the riskless asset. Note the dividend rate q1 of the first asset remains the same even with change of pricing. *Applying the Black-Scholes formula with these values as the appropriate inputs, e.g. initial asset value S1(0)/S2(0), interest rate q2, volatility œÉ, etc., gives us the price of the option under numeraire pricing. *Since the resulting option price is in units of S2, multiplying through by S2(0) will undo our change of numeraire, and give us the price in our original currency, which is the formula above. Alternatively, one can show it by the Girsanov theorem.

Its sister station, 89.3 KSBJ, concentrates on Christian contemporary music, aimed at listeners in their 30s and 40s. The studios and offices are on Treble Drive in Humble, Texas, near Bush Intercontinental Airport. KXNG has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 50,000 watts. The transmitter is off Sorters McClellan Road in Porter, Texas.Radio-Locator.com/KXNG KXNG is also rebroadcast on three full-powered FM stations around Southeast Texas and on two low power FM translators, 91.3 at Texas A&M; University and 93.1 in College Station. KXNG broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. History =Rice University= On May 20, 1971, the station first signed on as KTRU, operated by Rice University.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1973 page B-196 Studios were located in Sid Richardson College on the Rice campus. Initially broadcasting at 10 watts, the students engineered an increase to 340 watts in April 1974 and 650 watts in October 1980. The broadcast day also increased from the initial evening-only hours to 10 to 12 hours a day on weekdays and most of the weekend. In 1981, the station expanded its broadcast hours to 24 hours per day. In 1987, a major expansion of the student center was completed and the station's studios were relocated to the 2nd floor of the Ley Student Center. In 1991, the station's transmitter was moved to the north of Houston, increasing in power to 50,000 watts. The station was presented with an operating endowment by Mike Stude, the owner of Houston-area radio station 92.1 KRTS (now KROI) and an heir of the founders of Brown & Root. This move enabled Stude's station, which aired classical music, to increase from 3,000 watts to 50,000 watts without interfering with KTRU's signal. =Classical Music - University of Houston= On August 17, 2010, the University of Houston announced its intent to purchase KTRU's tower, frequency and license from Rice. That would give the university the ownership of two Houston FM stations. The university's main FM signal, KUHF 88.7 MHz, would go from a mix of news and classical music to all news and information. The 91.7 frequency would give classical music and fine arts programming a full-time outlet, with the proposed call sign KUHA. The FCC approved the purchase and transfer of license to the University of Houston System on April 15, 2011. At 6:00 AM on April 28, 2011, KTRU went dark. KUHA began broadcasting May 16, 2011. The student-run KTRU programming was transferred to the HD2 subchannel of local Pacifica Radio member station 90.1 KPFT. KPFT dropped KTRU on its HD2 subchannel in October 2015, when KTRU programming began broadcasting on 96.1 KBLT-LP (now KTRU-LP), which presently broadcasts Rice University student programming. KUHA debuted in 2011 with a distinctive classical sound. Unlike most stations airing the format, hosts selected their own playlists from the 50,000 classical music CD library owned by the station, one of the largest in the world. Because of this freedom, each live classical program on the station had its own unique flavor KUHA struggled to raise enough money to pay for its staff and facilities. In an effort to remain solvant, on November 7, 2013, KUHA fired nearly all its announcers and staff. The station replaced nearly all of its locally produced programming with Public Radio International's \\"Classical 24,\\" a nationally syndicated classical music service produced in Minnesota. It also began airing nationally distributed public radio programs dealing with classical music, such as From the Top, Performance Today and Pipedreams (which features organ music). KUHA was the flagship radio home of the Houston Symphony. Its broadcasts were heard on Wednesday evenings on KUHA when in season. When the classical format moved to KUHF-HD2, the agreement with the Houston Symphony remained in place and its broadcasts are now heard on KUHF-HD2. On March 3, 2014, Houston Public Radio's KUHA and KUHF, along with Houston PBS television station KUHT Channel 8, were all rebranded as \\"Houston Public Media.\\" =KSBJ Ownership= KUHA's fundraising and financial picture did not improve, despite the staff cuts. On August 20, 2015, the University of Houston System announced its intention to sell KUHA, after which the classical music format would only be heard on KUHF's HD2 subchannel and online streaming platforms, as well as a fifth subchannel of television station KUHT. The sale was approved by the UH System Board of Regents. On February 24, 2016, the university announced that the station was being sold for $10 million to the KSBJ Educational Foundation, which planned to flip the station to its NGEN Radio format upon taking control. With the impending sale, KUHA dropped almost all references to the 91.7 frequency in May and rebranded itself as Houston Public Media Classical, running advertisements for the digital streams of the format to redirect listeners. On May 20, 2016, the license reassignment for KUHA was granted by the Federal Communications Commission. With the ownership change, plans were made to change the station's call letters when the hand-off took place. On July 1, 2016, KUHA announced that it would cease broadcasting on July 15. KSBJ planned for NGEN programming to begin broadcasting on 91.7 on August 8. On July 14, KUHA ended regular programming. It began airing prerecorded announcements that the station had ceased broadcasting and redirected listeners to the digital streams. The 91.3 translator, which was included in the sale to KSBJ, went silent. At 9 o'clock the following morning, KSBJ's purchase of KUHA closed. Consequently, at that time the station stopped airing its prerecorded announcements and signed off. KSBJ said it would replace the old transmitter that had been used since 1990 with a brand-new transmitter. KSBJ also announced that the call letters would be changed to KXNG. The translator, 91.3 K217GB, also stopped broadcasting dead air and went dark that day. KXNG returned to the air two weeks later on August 1, 2016, stunting with a varied playlist of secular dance music under the branding K-Dance. The following Friday, the K217GB translator returned to the air rebroadcasting KXNG and the dance music stunt. Unlike KXNG, K217GB's transmitter was not replaced or modified. At 6:00 AM on August 8, 2016, the stunting ended and the NGEN Radio format made its debut with a launch party that was simulcast on KSBJ. 91.7 NGEN Radio utilizes a live and local lineup: \\"Marcus In The Morning\\" in AM drive time, the \\"Mid-Day Show with Lauree,\\" the \\"Afternoon Show with Chris Chicago & Lil Ang,\\" \\"NeallyTime @Night W/ Neal Hopson\\" and the \\"Brant & Sherri\\" in late nights. Translators Included in the purchase of KTRU was an FM translator that improved reception in the area near the campus of Rice University. The translator has been relocated off-campus after the sale and moved to an adjacent frequency. This translator was also included in the sale to KSBJ. During its ownership by the University of Houston, the translator rebroadcast KUHF-HD2, which simulcast KUHA. Upon the completion of the sale to KSBJ, the translator reverted to rebroadcasting the 91.7 feed. On August 8, 2016, KXNG added a second translator, K258BZ, with both translators relaying the main KXNG signal. Since then, KXNG has added K226AE, allowing NGEN Radio to be heard over the air in College Station, Texas.

The great diversity in plant life and altitudinally-determined microenvironments that surrounded the marsh helped to make it a popular place to live, as evidenced by archaeological findings.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 9. At Stillwater Marsh, skeletal remains were the primary means used to determine how people lived in the area. As large numbers of skeletons had not previously been found at Great Basin sites, Stillwater Marsh offered a remarkable opportunity to learn about daily life, as reflected in the human remains. A area of the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as Stillwater Marsh, which provides limited protections.  Skeletal Remains  Flooding in the Great Basin between 1982 and 1986 unearthed approximately 4,000 human bones from an estimated 416 people. These bones were found in isolated, scattered graves across a ten square mile area.Raymond, A.W., 1992, Who Were the Ancient People of Stillwater Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, Nevada. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. There were no indications of formal funerary services as evidenced by the lack of grave goods.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 37 Excavations at the Stillwater Marsh site were begun by the Nevada State Museum in 1985 and 1986, then continued by the Human Skeletal Field Survey team, a group of archaeologists that conducted the majority of research on the Stillwater Marsh skeletal remains, in 1987.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 33, 138 Over 140 of the skeletons were deemed to be ‚Äúrelatively complete,‚Äù while many of the others were characterized by as little as one piece of bone.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 33 The skeletons found in Stillwater Marsh were not representative of a single population, but instead from different groups of people who resided in the area over the course of about 3,000 years. Radiocarbon dates indicate that there could have been people living in the Marsh for as long as 2,500 years,Cabana, G.S., K. Hunley, and F.A. Kaestle, 2008, Population Continuity or Replacement? A Novel Computer Simulation Approach and its Application to the Numic Expansion (Western Great Basin, USA). American Journal of Physical Anthropology 135:438-447. p 440 with the earliest settlement possibly coming approximately 3,200 years ago.Morris, K. and A.W. Raymond, 1993, People of the Marsh: A Cultural and Natural History of Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The skeletal remains suitable for analysis displayed a range of health conditions. Some were found without any pathological issues that would indicate health problems. Others, however, had characteristics indicative of a difficult lifestyle. From Site 26Ch1046, one of the scattered burial pits found within the Stillwater Marsh locality, the skeletons of two young males were analyzed. Their bones demonstrate the effects of poor nutrition, as evidenced by unusual depressions at muscle attachment sites. One of the skeletons showed signs of anemia, as denoted by the presence of cribra orbitalia, which could have developed as a result of a nutrient-poor diet. Further evidence of cribra orbitalia was found by the Human Skeletal Field Survey in the summer of 1987. A juvenile skeleton was excavated that displayed anemia in this same pattern.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 49 While not exactly a sample of the population, these three young skeletons seem to indicate that appropriate nutrition may not have always been available for children, whose immune systems were still developing, leaving them more susceptible to infection. One of the most notable characteristics found in the Stillwater Marsh skeletal series is the occurrence of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is characterized by pitting on joint surfaces and bony outgrowths around the outer surfaces of joints. Of the approximately 67 cases of osteoarthritis found in the remains, a multitude of those cases had the disorder to the point of eburnation. The amount of effort required to remove the soft tissues in joints, leaving just bone-to-bone contact, such as in the hips or knees, is immense. Osteoarthritis that extreme indicated a highly mobile lifestyle. With the exception of the amount of osteoarthritis represented in the skeletal remains, the Stillwater Marsh people fit the definition of a hunter-gatherer society; the males ventured away from camping sites to hunt game, while the females remained close to the campsites gathering nuts, plants, and other foodstuffs It is evident, though, from the bones that they had to work more to meet their nutritional requirements than many other hunter-gatherer societies.Fagan, Brian 2005, Ancient North America. Thames & Hudson Ltd., London. p 285 Evidence from the skeletal remains shows that the majority of joints were affected by eburnation, including the jaw, ankles, wrists, and elbows, in addition to the hips and knees. There are a few ways for eburnation to occur: the continual movement of those joints, ingestion of a specific fungus that consumes cartilage or a combination of the two.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 108 The presence of bone in the joints is another way in which osteoarthritis presents itself. In the case of the Stillwater Marsh people, it seems more likely that continual movement of the joints, making bone come through the tissue layers, is the cause of their osteoarthritis. The most common joint affected by the disorder was the lumbar vertebrae of both males and females. There was extensive damage, when compared to the other joint surfaces on the skeletal remains, to the lumbar vertebrae. This damage indicates that there was lifting and heavy work being conducted by the Stillwater Marsh people. Females, however, had a higher frequency of osteoarthritis in their lumbar vertebrae than males did. This was the only measurement of osteoarthritis in which females exceeded males. Males had extensive osteoarthritis from their ankles up through to their shoulders. The majority of joint damage was bilateral in males and suggestive of travel with heavy loads up from and down to the Marsh. While this cannot be necessarily proven, the amount of osteoarthritis in the Stillwater Marsh population was so much greater than that of surrounding low-level populations that it appears to be a logical argument. Age was also a factor in demonstrating the extent of this disorder. Despite the longer life span of females, osteoarthritis still affected males more frequently.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 114 A study done by Clark Spencer Larsen and Christopher B. Ruff on bones collected by the Nevada State Museum provides support for age and nutritional deficiencies as factors for osteoarthritis. The selected long bones included in this study were shown to have an immense amount of strength, which was required for the amount of heavy work they conducted. However, skeletons that were 40 years or older at the time of their death show a surprising lack of replacement to damaged bone. Nutrition is believed to be the major cause of the amount of bone loss based on the relatively young age, when compared to other prehistoric populations, at time of death of most of the skeletons.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 122, 130. An additional feature found on the teeth of the Stillwater Marsh people were hypoplasias, disturbances in the normal formation of enamel caused by nutritional and environmental stresses on the body.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 134. The appearance of these defects is most prominent at the labial and buccal surfaces after extended utilization of the occlusal surface wears down the teeth. After a study was conducted by Dale L. Hutchinson and Clark Spencer Larsen using teeth from approximately 40 of the skeletal remains collected by the Nevada State Museum and the Human Skeletal Field Survey, it was found that hypoplasia was not as common in the Stillwater Marsh populations as in other prehistoric populations.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 81-89. This is a positive signal that there was slightly better nutritional options available for the people of Stillwater Marsh, but their diet clearly did not meet all of their nutritional needs as hypoplasia was still notable on teeth. The teeth of the Stillwater Marsh people also incurred a great deal of wear. After consuming seeds, using their teeth as tools, and chewing some stone and sand with meals for so long, the teeth of the skeletons that were older than 50 at the time of death were worn down to the roots. The amount of gritty material that clung to the gums led to periodontal disease in many of the Marsh people's jaws. Despite the other issues concerning the teeth and jaws of the Stillwater Marsh people, their teeth did not decay, as sugar was not part of their diet. The skeletal remains of the people who once inhabited the Stillwater Marsh region tell us they worked very hard for their subsistence.  Subsistence  Nutrition played a large role in determining the skeletal health of the Stillwater Marsh people. The number of human remains found suggests that the Marsh was one of the more populous regions in the Great Basin, indicating that the people living there has to become adept at using all of the natural food resources at their disposal. One of the major food sources in the Great Basin was the pine nut.Fagan, Brian 2005, Ancient North America. Thames & Hudson Ltd., London. p 269 There is no evidence of the Stillwater Marsh people consuming pine nuts, however. Pine nuts did not even appear in the Marsh area until a little over 1000 years ago.Kelly, R.L., and D.H. Thomas, 2010, Archaeology. Wadsworth, Belmont. pp. 223, 225. p 225 Paleoethnobotanical samples from the Stillwater Marsh site show that seeds were a major part of these prehistoric peoples‚Äô lives. Some of the more common seeds discovered were bulrush, cattail, and pickleweed, to name a few.Kelly, R.L., and D.H. Thomas, 2010, Archaeology. Wadsworth, Belmont. pp. 223, 225. p 223. Bulrush, however, was the most abundant seed found at the site. It is believed that, like other Native Americans, the Stillwater Marsh people utilized this seed as a source of nutrition.Larsen, C.S., and R.L. Kelly, 1995, Bioarchaeology of the Stillwater Marsh: Prehistoric Human Adaptation in the Western Great Basin. Anthropological Papers of The American Museum of Natural History 77. 170 pp. p 15. Based on the skeletal remains and knowledge of how hunter-gatherer societies functioned, females were most likely the ones that gathered these seeds for their families and communities. Additionally, some of these plants, mainly bulrush and cattail, are still in the Stillwater Marsh area. This seemingly indicates that they provided a continual food source for when people lived in the Marsh, as opposed to when they moved into the uplands for part of the year. In addition to plant species, the area also had numerous sources of animals for food. Migratory birds played a major role in the lives of the Marsh people. Nets were the primary method utilized to capture the birds.Fagan, Brian 2005, Ancient North America. Thames & Hudson Ltd., London. p 271 Some of the more common birds in the area were mallard ducks and coots. The birds not only served as a source of food, but also as a means of some basic human comforts. The feathers and skins of these birds were utilized in the creation of clothing for the Stillwater Marsh people. Another animal that played a pivotal role in the diet of the Marsh people was fish. The main fish species that they relied on was the tui chub, a type of minnow. The people used smaller tui chubs as a food source, as evidenced by the amount of skeletal remains of the fish found throughout the locality's sites.Butler, V.L., 1996, Tui Chub Taphonomy and the Importance of Marsh Resources in the Western Great Basin of North America. American Antiquity 61: 699-717. Small mammals, mainly rodents, provided nutrition for the Stillwater Marsh people when fish, like the tui chub, and birds were out of season. Rodents, such as the ground squirrel, were cooked whole, whereas small mammals, like the muskrat, had the fur removed before cooking.  Conclusion  There are still some unanswered questions about the people who lived at the Stillwater Marsh, such as why males had such severe osteoarthritis. Additional research needs to be conducted as to where the people of the Stillwater Marsh went after use at the burial area was discontinued. The skeletons that were analyzed from Stillwater Marsh were reinterred on land owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They are under protection by the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe.

In November 2008, Rathborne was featured in Interview magazine under their 'Discovery Artists' of the year.  Biography  Rathborne got his start by moving to New York City when he was 18 years old. His debut album, \\"After Dark\\" recorded when he was 17 years old started gaining the attention of figures in the music business, the first individual to discover Rathborne was Joey Levine, a songwriter of tin-pan alley fame who penned 60's classic, 'Yummy Yummy Yummy' among others. He decided to produce several songs for Rathborne and brought him to music industry figures eventually attracting management to Rathborne's Career. In 2011 Rathborne was signed to Los Angeles independent label, 'Dilettante' and Australian label, 'Speak N' Spell Records' and released a Double E.P. Record entitled, \\"Dog Years/I Can Be One E.P.\\". The Record was self-released by Rathborne in the U.K. on his own label, 'True Believer'. It gained much attention in the U.K. and prompted an appearance on Lauren Laverne's programme on 6 Music for the BBC and appearances in the NME, leading to a slot playing before 30,000 at SXSW and embarking on several US tours. The record featured two separate sides of different music representing two sides of the artist.  After Dark  Rathborne's first album, \\"After Dark\\" was recorded when he was 17 years old. Rathborne has stated in interviews in order to record the album he would have to sneak into a recording studio at night at a local college in his town, pretending to be doing a radio show at the college radio station, WBOR, and going in to record through the night. The record was completed without the knowledge of the local college, and was engineered and produced by Rathborne himself, who learned to use the studio without assistance. Rathborne's former bandmate and friend Dup Crosson of Saint Solitude, as well as many other Brunswick musicians, performed and helped arrange songs on the album as well.  England  Upon visiting the U.K. Rathborne caught the attention of BBC 6 Music DJ Lauren Laverne, who personally offered to bring Rathborne on her show, after another guest, ironically Noah and the Whale singer had called out sick. Rathborne was on tour in England and showed up to BBC Studios in London performing live on-air with his band. In February 2011 Rathborne organized a tour through London playing a different venue in London each night for seven nights. The tour was well received and documented by the fly magazine, '' 'It's a day that usually fills most workers with dread, but Sunday in Stoke Newington is an altogether different affair thanks to this night that helps to segue the excesses of the weekend into the calm predictability of the working week. This week, American troubadour Luke Rathborne is the special guest at The Drop ‚Äì just one of numerous performances over town. He comes bearing no gifts though and the evening kicks off an hour later than expected while the organisers struggle to find a backline and drum kit. It tends to be a simpler affair round here, you see. On record, his songs twist an engaging tale of gritty melancholy, but one that feels relatively restrained so it's a surprise when the guitars kick in and the world-weary, haunting tracks explode with such powerful force. Rathborne's voice has an old, worn quality that speaks of long roads travelled and of knowledge not expected from a 22-year-old. The comparisons to Bob Dylan and Elliott Smith are easily understood ‚Äì it's raw, simple, aching ‚Äì but his sparsely arranged confessionals are darkly captivating in their own right. Up above, the bar is packed with punters, all going about their evenings while down in this tiny little room, it feels like we're being let in on a secret that the rest of the world should not miss.'''  Releases  After Dark ‚Äì 2007 ‚Äì Rathborne's first album, \\"After Dark\\" was produced and engineered by Rathborne himself at the age of 17 and recorded in hometown of Brunswick, Maine. The album features a handful of different styles and a small pressing was done on Rathborne's own label, \\"Coonbone Records\\". This record went on to capture the attention of different individuals in New York City, prompting Rathborne's move. \\"I Can Be One E.P./Dog Years E.P.\\" ‚Äì 2011 ‚Äì In 2011 Rathborne was signed to Los Angeles independent label, 'Dilettante' and Australian label, 'Speak N' Spell Records' and released a Double E.P.

North Borneo =Sultanate of Sulu= ICJ on 25 June 2001. Between 1658 and 1700s, the Sultanate of Sulu acquiring the eastern part of the territory of northern Borneo after helping the Bruneian forces in settling a civil war. The Sulu Archipelago then came under the control of Spanish, while the area in northern Borneo was administered by the British. Under a series of agreements between the Sultanate of Brunei and Sulu, both the sultans agreed to ceded their control on west and eastern part of northern Borneo to the British in which it became known as North Borneo. In a process of decolonisation since 1946, Great Britain included Sabah in the newly formed Federation of Malaysia. The Philippines (who already achieved its independence from the United States) under the administration of President Diosdado Macapagal however protested the formation of Malaysia and filed claims to the whole territory of northern Borneo. Meanwhile, during a meeting of Maphilindo, the Philippines government said they had no objection to the formation of Malaysia but said the Sultan of Sulu wanted the payment of 5,000 although the British government never paid any compensation to the Sultanate. The first Malaysian Prime Minister at the time, Tunku Abdul Rahman said he would go back to Kuala Lumpur and get back to them on the claim. The situation worsened under the administration of the then Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos who then revived the claim and trained a number of Moro fighters to reclaim the territory under a secret mission called \\"Operation Merdeka\\". Upon the recruits realising their true mission, most of them demanded to return home as they did not want to kill their fellow Muslim brothers in Sabah. But Marcos soldiers did not sent them back and instead executed most of the fighters in an event called the Jabidah massacre. The tragedy sparked the South Philippines insurgency with the claim having been compounded by other new claimants from the now defunct Sultanate of Sulu. Pretenders of the Sultan of Sulu are supported by politicians in the Philippine central government to reclaim Sabah as part of the Philippine territory. The claimants and several Philippine politicians today use the Malaysian payment of 5,000[what?] as their main reason to take over the territory as told to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). =Manila Accord= During the formation of Malaysia, the Federation of Malaya signed the Manila Accord along with the Malaysia Act 1963.Malaysia Act 1963 These acts solidified the position regarding claim of North Borneo by the Philippines following the establishment of Malaysia.United Nations Press Release United Nations Member States Per international law, the Malayan government, as a predecessor state to Malaysia, agreed to abide by the wishes of the peoples of North Borneo and Sarawak within the context of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV), Principle 9 of the Annex, which was created to complete compliance with the principle of self- determination.General Assembly 15th Session ‚Äì The Trusteeship System and Non- Self-Governing Territories (pages:509‚Äì510) General Assembly 18th Session ‚Äì the Question of Malaysia (pages:41‚Äì44) International law also took into account referendums in North Borneo and Sarawak that would be free and without coercion.

In 1755, the family obtained a royal warrant to produce cognac and a founding charter signed by King Louis XV. Maison Gautier was born, and the winery was installed in the former watermill in Aigre. The heirs of Maison Gautier succeeded each other in turn over 10 generations, developing the family business.

The company was involved in multiple scandals related to its work at the site. The company was founded in 1983 and named for a character from Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged. The company had apparently done no substantial work of any kind until it was subcontracted by Bovis Lend Lease to demolish the Deutsche Bank Building. The company essentially acted as a shell corporation for the Regional Scaffolding and Hoisting Company and two former Safeway Environmental Corporation executives. The use of a shell corporation is not unusual within the demolition industry, but the participation of Safeway Environmental executives drew attention because of past problems that company had with government contracts, including accusations of ties to criminal organizations. Three of the company's construction supervisors (Mitchel Alvo, Salvatore DePaola, and Jeffrey Melofchik) were charged for manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide as a result of the deaths of two firefighters in a fire which broke out in August 2007. The John Galt Corporation was also charged. Alvo was acquitted in a bench trial; DePaola and Melofchik were cleared in a jury trial. The company was acquitted of manslaughter, but was convicted of second-degree reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor. In a separate case, one of the company's purchasing agents, Robert Chiarappa, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for embezzling over 1.2 million dollars from the building's demolition. Three other people also pleaded guilty for their involvement in the scheme.

No individual handling of the unit packs is necessary Carrots on display in returnable plastic bins Six packs of water bottles delivered on a pallet to the store and being sold on the same pallet Display stand at the end of aisle, delivered to the store ready-to-place Shelf-ready packaging (SRP) and retail-ready packaging (RRP) (also pr√™t-√†- vendre (PAV)) refers to the packaging of a product so that it is delivered to a retailer in packaging which is optimized for efficient stocking and sale. Cleaning product placed on shelf in SRP trays; upper parts of boxes removed Cans of cookies in corrugated display boxes on pallet at warehouse club store Background Retailers, particularly large big-box stores, superstores and warehouse clubs, sell large quantities of fast-moving consumer goods. These retailers often want to have items shipped from their distribution centers to the stores in unit loads and bulk boxes: these can be stocked without handling of the merchandise. The purpose of corrugated shipping containers is to put case goods directly onto shelves and stocking locations without individually handling the unit packs or primary packages. Retailers often require products to come in shelf-ready packaging to reduce stocking costs by saving labor expenses. Ready-to-go display stands and end caps are put in the retail sales location by forklift trucks without assembly or manual handling of unit packs. Requirements Retailers commonly specify all aspects of incoming logistics and packaging to their suppliers. This includes pallet size, bar code format and placement, RFID tags, strength of corrugated shipping containers etc. Boxes must be easy to open and prepare for stocking. Several designs are available. Box perforations, tear tape, etc must be intuitive and easy. box cutters are often discouraged. Frequently, requirements for reusable packaging and sustainable packaging are also provided. The principles of shelf-ready packaging are almost universal. Not all retailers, however, have the same detailed requirements. For example, Costcos \\"Structural Packaging Specifications\\", Target's \\"Shelf Ready and Transit Packaging Standards, Hardgoods\\", and Walmart's \\"RRP and PDQ Display Standard Style Guide\\" are similar but not identical. Regional coordination in Europe has produced an agreement on common functional requirements for the design of SRP. The Efficient Consumer Response (ECR), Europe Working Group, has published \\"Shelf Ready Packaging\\" to help standardize programs. Manufacturers and packagers need to keep the diverse requirements of the retailers in mind as they package and ship their products. Sometimes consultants and contract packagers with experience in shelf-ready-packaging are useful. Types Due to the fact that there are many different products which need to be packed in a SRP, products can be delivered by a variety of solutions. =Shelf tray= SRP solutions which can be placed in the shelf are predominantly made of corrugated cardboard. In general, these consist of a tray (secondary packaging) and a cover (a lid which protects the product). The cover can be easily separated from the tray by a perforation.ECR Europe, GS1 Germany GmbH (2007), Handelsgerechte Regalverpackungen Sometimes the cover of a tray is a transparent film which protects the products from mechanical and climatic influences.GS1 Germany (2008), Supply Chain Management =Re-usable plastic tray= In addition to SRP made of corrugated cardboard, packaging can also be made of re-usable materials such as plastic. Such plastic containers can be re-used directly in the store. Furthermore, if re-use is not possible, the containers can be returned to the producer.ECR Europe, GS1 Germany GmbH (2007), Handelsgerechte Regalverpackungen =Merchandising unit= Merchandising units represent another type of SRP solutions. They are used for secondary placement. Normally, promotional goods or fast-moving products are presented in a merchandising unit. An enormous number of products can be placed in a merchandising unit. Therefore, the merchandising unit serves as SRP.ECR Europe, GS1 Germany GmbH (2007), Handelsgerechte Regalverpackungen Secondary placements can trigger impulse purchases. Often, roll-up palettes, called dollies, are used as a base for merchandising units. Rolling pallets facilitate the handling of merchandising units and increase flexibility.o.V. (2008), Von Regaltray bis zu Logistikdisplays, In. Markenartikel Importance of shelf-ready packaging Shelf-ready packaging continues to be growing in many market segments, including over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. SRP helps retail stores to achieve cost savings in labor and in packaging materials. It also makes packaged products easier to spot for customers, resulting in better sales. Significant efforts and investments are usually made in improving aisle efficiency for consumers, ensuring consistent demand for suitable retail-ready products from physical outlets.

He coached 66 games in 3 seasons before he resigned from the job. He has served as the development and strategy coach of the Melbourne Football Club since 2015. Playing career In his playing days, Brendan McCartney played in the Geelong Football League for the Newtown & Chilwell Football Club. He is one of the few AFL coaches who never played at the highest level. His father, Graeme McCartney, played one senior game with Richmond in 1957. Coaching career After persistent injury curtailed his local playing career and premature retirement at 27, he first began coaching Newtown & Chilwell's reserves. Soon after, McCartney was appointed the head coach of the Ocean Grove Football Club. He guided the football club to four consecutive Bellarine Football League premierships from 1994 until 1997. In 1998, he took a role with AFL club Richmond as assistant and development coach. From 2000 to 2010, McCartney was an assistant coach with Geelong Football Club, before moving to be the forward line coach at Essendon in 2011. In 2010, McCartney was voted the AFL's assistant coach of the year by the AFL Coaches' Association. Shortly after the conclusion of the 2011 AFL season, McCartney was appointed as the new senior coach of the Western Bulldogs under a three-year contract, replacing the outgoing Rodney Eade and in doing so edging out favourite and former Bulldog Leon Cameron as well as a \\"high quality field\\". He took the Western Bulldogs for their training session for the first time on 7 November 2011. McCartney came under heavy criticism after the Bulldogs lost to expansion team Gold Coast in Round 8, but the team had a better second half to the season, which included promising performances against top 8 teams Essendon, Hawthorn and Sydney, as well as wins against Carlton, West Coast and Adelaide. As a result of the encouraging performances in the second half, McCartney received a two-year contract extension on 26 November 2013 and he was to be contracted to the end of the 2016 season. Following speculation after the 2014 AFL season, which concluded with the Bulldogs losing to in the final match of the regular season, McCartney resigned as head coach on 10 October 2014. When captain Ryan Griffen announced he wanted to leave the club the day before McCartney's resignation, it was reported that McCartney's relationship with Griffen caused him to want to leave the club. McCartney joined the coaching staff as a development and strategy coach under Paul Roos from the 2015 season.

However, this doesn't prevent the occasional big-name artist from stopping by.

Early history Coal was discovered in Kent in the late-19th century, but extraction did not begin until 1912.Nigel Yates, Kent in the Twentieth Century, pp.30-35 The Kent Miners Association was established in 1915, and immediately affiliated to the Miners' Federation of Great Britain.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, pp.221-222 Working conditions in the mines were poor, and mine owners struggled to attract workers, giving a strong bargaining position to the union. In 1941, a dispute emerged over additional payments for working a particularly difficult seam. Official arbitration backed the mineowners, prompting more than 4,000 coal miners to strike, despite a wartime ban on industrial action. The government responded by arresting 1,000 miners and imprisoning three union officials with hard labour, but when only nine workers paid their fines, the government was forced to negotiate with the gaoled union leaders who were released after eleven days and the fines waived. The union became the Kent Area of the National Union of Mineworkers in 1945, by which time, membership had reached 5,100. In 1961, 160 workers at Betteshanger were served with redundancy notices. A stay-down strike was launched, which succeeded in persuading the National Coal Board to open a new seam, allowing the workforce to remain at the same level. 1984-85 Strike Kent NUM badge produced in support of 1984 strike. One pit closed in 1969, and two more were listed for closure in 1981. The area was strongly supportive of the UK miners' strike of 1984-1985. The Kent miners were successful in raising funds from sympathetic socialists in London and from trade unions in continental Europe, which allowed the Kent strikers to maintain a higher standard of living that those in other parts of Britain and generated some resentment. Malcolm Pitt, the area president, was jailed for allegedly breaching bail conditions,Jonathan and Ruth Winterton, Coal, crisis, and conflict: the 1984-85 miners' strike in Yorkshire, p.163 and suspected miners were turned back at the Dartford Tunnel to prevent picketing.Jonathan and Ruth Winterton, Coal, crisis, and conflict: the 1984-85 miners' strike in Yorkshire, p.295 The Kent NUM applied for an injunction against use of this power. Sir Michael Havers initially denied this application outright, but Mr. Justice Skinner later ruled that this power of the police may only be used if the anticipated breach of the peace were \\"in close proximity both in time and place\\". Kent NUM leader Jack Collins said after the decision of the NUM conference in March 1985 to end the strike without an amnesty for those sacked during the dispute, \\"The people who have decided to go back to work and leave men on the sidelines are traitors to the trade-union movement.\\" The Kent NUM organised a continuation of picketing across the country, which delayed the return to work at many pits for another two weeks. Arthur Scargill himself was turned back at the gates of Barrow Colliery in Worsborough when he tried to lead the miners back to work. There were only 32 strikebreakers in Kent in the 1984-85 strike, and they were subject to so many attacks on their person and property that they had all left the industry by April 1986. The last coal mine closed in 1989. General Secretaries :1915: W. H. Varley :1919: H.

Unlike in the west, where there has been a long tradition of documenting genealogical data (i.e.: births, marriages and deaths) from very early times, in Sri Lanka it is only after the advent of the Portuguese that such information was recorded systematically in the Parish records. These records were destroyed by the Portuguese to prevent it from falling into the hands of the advancing Dutch Army. In Sri Lanka as in the Indian sub- continent, genealogical information was maintained and passed down by Oral Tradition prior to the advent of the Colonial Powers. Even the Hindu religious teachings such as the Vedas have been passed down the centuries, from father to Son by word of mouth. In Jaffna, genealogical information about prominent families were also traditionally maintained by the Paraiyar community (the drummer caste). The feudal structure, which was largely intact until the 1950s 1960‚Äôs, has disappeared hastened by the ethnic conflict. Village communities including the ‚ÄúParaiyars‚Äù have dispersed from their native villages, taking with them their knowledge of the local genealogies. Information that had been committed to writing was on perishable material, and hence very little if any has survived the ravages of time. Official Documents have also been lost in the destruction caused by the civil war.  Sri Lanka‚Äôs Documented History  * The Early Period - Unlike her neighbors, Sri Lanka has a well documented history from ancient times to the Middle Ages. The following ancient Chronicles tell the story of Sri Lanka: * The Dipavamsa, or \\"Deepavamsa\\", (Chronicle of the Island), Written in the ‚ÄúPali‚Äù language is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka. The chronicle is believed to be compiled from Atthakatha, and other sources around the 3rd and 4th century. Together with Mahavamsa, it is the source of many accounts of ancient history of Sri Lanka and India. It was set down, not as a history of Sri Lanka, but as a document which covers the advent and spread of Buddhism in the Island. The work has been translated into English by B. C. Law. It is believed to have been authored by several Buddhist monks of the Mahavihara tradition of Anuradhapura, in the 3rd and 4th centuries. * The Mahavamsa (\\"Great Chronicle\\") a historical poem also written in the ‚ÄúPali‚Äù language, gives an account of the kings of Sri Lanka. It covers the period from the coming of Prince Vijaya of Kalinga (ancient Orissa) in 543 BC to the reign of King Mahasena (334‚Äì361 AD). The first printed edition an English translation of the Mahavamsa was published in 1837 by George Turnour. A German translation of Mahavamsa was completed by Wilhelm Geiger in 1912. This was then translated into English by Mabel Haynes Bode, and subsequently revised by Geiger. * The C≈´·∏∑ava·πÉsa, or Chulavamsa, (Lesser Chronicle) is a historical record, written in the ‚ÄúPƒÅli‚Äù language, of the kings of Sri Lanka. It covers the period from the 4th century to 1815. The Culavamsa was compiled over many years, by Sinhalese Buddhist monks. It is generally considered to be a sequel to the Mahavamsa (\\"Great Chronicle\\") as it was written in the 6th century by the monk Mahanama. The Mahavamsa and the Culavamsa are sometimes thought of as a single work (referred to as the \\"Mahavamsa\\") spanning over two millennia of Sri Lankan history. The Mahavamsa, the Deepavamsa and the Culavamsa were all authored by Buddhist monks, and were written not as an accurate account of the history of the country, but, to highlight the importance of Buddhism within the historical panorama of events of the time. They record the public history of the period capturing the events that illustrate the pride of place afforded to Buddhism. Sadly no mention is made of the personal details of individuals, not even those of the various Kings who ruled Sri Lanka.  The Documented History of Jaffna - the Yalpana Vypava Malai, and the historical works that predated it  The Deepavamsa, Mahavamsa and Chulavamsa which chronicle the early history of Sri Lanka make very little reference to the Northern region of the country. The history of the Jaffna Peninsula and the Vanni region was for the first time documented during the Dutch period, when Jan Maccara commissioned Mylvagana Pulavar of Mathakal to set down the history, and oral traditions of the area. The outcome was the ‚ÄúYalpana Vaipava Malai‚Äù, which is based on the following ancient publications. # Kailaya Malai # Vaiya Padal # Raja Murai # Pararajasekharan Ula ‚ÄúThe author says that he referred the books Kailaya Malai, Vaiyai Padal and Pararajasekaran Ula for his work. It is said that these books are composed not earlier than the fourteenth Century A. D., contain folklore; legends and myths mixed with historical anecdotes. Today, except the Kailaya Malai which has been printed, and a few manuscript copies of Vaiya Padal, the other works are very rare and hardly procurable.‚Äù Mylvaganam was a poet, and not a scholar who had been trained in the discipline of historical research. Hence the Vaipava Malai like the Mahawamsa, though containing many historical truths and traditions cannot be accepted in its entirety. Not only are there chronological errors, especially when narrating the last phase of the Tamil kingdom, but there seems to be some confusion regarding historical personages being referred to therein. At times the author has even taken liberties with history, and has created his own stories in order to establish certain traditional beliefs. The Yalpana Vypava Malai which lay forgotten during the early British occupation was discovered and translated into English by C. Brito and first published in English in 1879. This was followed by some reprints in Tamil, the best known was a reprint in Tamil edited by Mudaliyar Kula Sabanathan which appeared in 1953.  Available Source Material for Genealogical Studies  Although the island has a well document history, based on the afore mentioned chronicles, and ancient inscriptions, covering a period of twenty three centuries, the oldest archives extant in Sri Lanka date back only to the 16th century. The archives of the Sri Lankan monarchy if any have been lost to posterity.http://www.tissanayagam.com =The Portuguese Period (1505-1658)= The Portuguese, who ruled Sri Lanka from 1506‚Äì1638 AD, made use of the indigenous land records relating to the maritime districts under their control, which formed the basis of their ‚ÄúThombus‚Äù and ‚ÄúForals‚Äù (quit-rent registers.) These Thombus later became the foundation of their revenue collection and also an important collection of the archives. Under the Portuguese, Vendor da Fazenda (Superintendent of Revenue) acted as the archivist, by preserving the Thombus, and also was responsible to keep them up to date. When the Portuguese possessions in the island were attacked by the Dutch in 1640 AD, a majority of the records were destroyed in order to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. Accordingly, there are no original source materials preserved in the National Archives to study the Portuguese period of Sri Lanka. There are a few copies of the Portuguese Thombus and Forals for the years 1614 and 1618 on microfilm that have been obtained from Lisbon, and now available in the local archives, as well as some scholarly works by Sri Lankans who have used the primary sources in Lisbon and written comprehensive thesis on the Portuguese period in the history of Sri Lanka. = The Dutch Period (1656-1796) = Dutch archival material covers the period starting 1640 AD up to 1796, and gives a researcher an in-depth knowledge of the political, economical, social and cultural aspects of that era. They are a continuous series of important primary sources for the study of the history of Sri Lanka. Some important sources of information during the Dutch period include: * Registration of land ‚Äì The Land Thombu records the lands belonging to each family. They were classified according to Korales, Pattuwas and Villages. All the lands were assessed based on fertility. * Registration of births marriages and deaths ‚Äì The Hoofd Thombu or Head Thombu is a genealogical register of the proprietors of the land distributed in the corresponding Land Thombu. It was called the head thombu because in each case names are tabulated under a head or representative of a family. * Appointment of native headmen ‚Äì The Dutch like the Portuguese before them recognised the value of maintaining the ancient system of ‚Äútenure‚Äù prevalent during the times of the Native Kings. Accordingly, property, within the conquered areas were held at the will of the Dutch East India Company as Lord Paramount. Entire villages were settled on the Headman who as a rule were paid no salaries, but were due the rights and dues usually rendered by the village community to the Headman. Such grants of land were recorded in deeds of ‚Äúaccomodessa‚Äù which, are a valuable source of information as they also list down the ‚Äúmajoraals‚Äù or the husbandmen working under each village headman. * Diaries of governors and Commanders ‚Äì Many of the Dutch Governors of Ceylon have left behind their memoirs, and some have even spent much time meticulously preparing handing over notes for their successors. Many of these notes, journals and diaries give great insight into the traditions and social structures prevalent at the time. An example is the succession note left by Dutch Governor Van Imhoff where he outlines the evils of the ‚Äútenure‚Äù system and advocates a move to a more progressive system which could eliminate the office of the village Chieftain. This new system was implemented approx 100 years into the Dutch rule of the Island. Much of the registries used during the Dutch period were preserved and improved on during the British period in the history of the country. =The British Period (1796-1948)= The British who captured the island from the Dutch in 1796, developed a modern records and archives management system. Clause four (4) of the articles of capitulation, emphatically expressed that all public papers should be faithfully delivered over. During the early British period the Colonial Chief Secretary of the British administration was the custodian of official records. In 1803 the post was named ‚ÄúKeeper of the Dutch records‚Äù. In the year 1902, the post of archivist was created and all the archives throughout the country were placed in his care. In 1947, the post of Government Department Archivist was established. When the British first conquered the maritime provinces of Sri Lanka, administration of the lands within their control were managed through the East India Company. By the early 1830s, the British had almost finished consolidating their position in Sri Lanka, and began to take more of an interest in securing the island's political stability, and economic profitability. A new wave of thought, influenced by the reformist political ideology articulated by Jeremy Bentham and James Mill, promised to change fundamentally Britain's relationship to its colonies. Known as utilitarianism, and later as philosophical radicalism, it promoted the idea of democracy and individual liberty. This philosophy sponsored the idea of the trusteeship, i.e., that new territories would be considered trusts, and would receive all the benefits of British liberalism. These philosophical abstractions were put into practical use with the recommendations of a commission, led by W.M.G. Colebrooke and C.H. Cameron. Their Colebrooke Report (1831‚Äì32) was an important document in the history of the island. G.C. Mendis, considered by many to be the doyen of modern Sri Lankan history, considers the Colebrooke-Cameron reforms to be the dividing line between the past and present in Sri Lanka. One part of these reforms were the setting up of the Ceylon Civil Services, which ensured a more structured and planned approach to recording demographic events including: * Registration of Births and Deaths ‚Äì As the population, especially in the Maritime provinces grew exponentially during the British occupation of Sri Lanka, the British established administrative offices in the key cities and towns and ensured that all births and deaths were recorded and registered, while certificates were issued as proof that the incident had been officially recorded. In Sri Lanka, a system of registration of vital events i.e. births, deaths and marriages has been in existence since 1867, when the Department of Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages was established, following which registration of deaths and births was made compulsory in 1897. * Registration of Land transactions - Under British rule, there were significant changes to land ownership policies. During the early part of British rule, the policies concentrated on the provision of larger tracts of land, for plantations of cinnamon, coffee, tea, rubber and coconuts. This influenced to a large extent the changes to the traditional policies and attitudes to land. In 1840, enactment of the Crown Lands (Encroachment) Ordinance was a landmark event. Under that ordinance all waste lands in the country such as forests and chena (shifting cultivation), uncultivated and unoccupied lands were presumed to be property of the crown, unless proved otherwise. This ensured the availability of crown lands for the British investors for plantations. The first significant legislation to attempt introduction of title registration in Sri Lanka was enacted in 1863. It did not lead to the full registration of titles as envisaged by the government of the day. Unfortunately, as a temporary measure, the government allowed the adoption of the registration of deeds, which is still in place today and is entrenched in the laws of Sri Lanka. * Parish and School records ‚ÄìThe British governor Robert Browning, who took office in 1812, played a key role in establishing many missionary schools especially in the Maritime provinces of the island. He was also a key influence in setting up mission churches and parishes and converting the natives to Christianity. As parishes and missionary schools grew, they began to record information about parishioners and students enrolled, and thus a huge repository of information was built, which become and excellent source of genealogical information. * Another excellent source of information are the diaries of the Government agents and the Governors as well as the many commission reports which dotted the British occupation of Sri Lanka. Documentation and capture of information during the British period in Sri Lanka was initially a continuation of the practises established by the Dutch. However the British improved the civil administration of the country and thus the capture and documentation of information.  Subsequent Publications on the History of Jaffna  There was a renewed interest in the history of Jaffna in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, which resulted in a host of publications. Notable among them were ‚ÄúAncient Jaffna‚Äù by Mudaliyar RasanayagamAncient Jaffna by Mudaliyar Rasanayagam and works titled ‚ÄúHistory of Jaffna‚Äù by S. John, and by Mootha Tambipillai.History of Jaffna by S. John, and Mootha Tambipillai These works were based mainly on the Vaipava Malai. Other works include ‚ÄúNotes on Jaffna‚Äù by John H. Martyn,Notes on Jaffna by John H. Martyn the many publications by the two outstanding scholars of that period Fr. Gnanaprakasar and Sir Paul E. Peiris. There have been many recent publications on the archaeology and history of the Jaffna peninsula as well. Those worthy of mention include publications by Dr Ragupathy, Dr. Indrapala, and Prof. Pathmanathan, which give greater insight into the history of the Jaffna peninsula. However the twilight years of the Ariya Chakravarti rule, prior to the Portuguese conquest of the Kingdom still remain unclear and hazy. =Publications on the Genealogy of Jaffna Families= The discovery and publication of the Yalpana Vaipaya Malai,Yalpana Vaipava Malai - by C. Brito at the turn of the 19th century also sparked off an interest in genealogy for some of the Tamil families. Many families were keen to trace their roots as far back as they could. Some of these genealogies were printed for limited private circulation. Most of these publications were not researched by independent authorities, nor have they been substantiated by any documentary, or historical evidence. Many of these seem to be attempts by families to aggrandise the lineage. Of the books so published one of the best known and best researched was the ‚ÄúManiyam Pathiyar Santhathi Murai‚ÄùManiyam Pathiyar Santhathi Murai - by T. Vinasithamby(the genealogies of the inhabitants of the village of Manipay) by the late T. Vinasithamby. The author was a paternal uncle of the scholar, and theologian the late Dr Isaac Thambiah, who had married Mangalanayagam, daughter of the late Mudaliyar J. W. Barr- Kumarakulasinghe. In his book he has traced the genealogies of some of the families living in Manipaye during his time to the Dutch period. Some of the families mentioned in the book even have their origins outside the village of Manipay. This yet again substantiates the fact that accurate, independent documentary evidence is available only up to the Dutch period. ‚ÄúManiyam Pathiyar Santhathi Murai‚Äù does not make any claims about the caste superiority or lineage of the families mentioned therein, nor does it claim any special status for the village of Manipay. In sharp contrast to the ‚ÄúManiyam Pathiyar Santhathi Murai‚Äù which is a well researched publication, is the ‚ÄúYalpana Vaipava Kaumudhi‚ÄùYalpana Vaipava KaumudhiKallady Vellupilla by a poet Kallady Vellupillai. A major part of the book covers the history of Jaffna and is based on the ‚ÄúYaplana Vaipava Malai‚Äù. Another section covers the genealogy of some of the Jaffna Tamil families of his time. It was current knowledge at the time that the ancestry published in this work depended on the size of the contribution made by the respective families, to the author. Another unreliable work that was published in 1930 was the book titled Mel Makkal CharithiramMel Makkal Charithiram by Pandit Ratnaswami Iyar (the genealogies of some eminent Tamil gentlemen of Ceylon) By Pandit Ratnaswami Iyar. This like the well known publication 20th Century Impressions was a book written as a business venture, where the objective of the author was to collect contributions from the various individuals whose genealogies the work contained. Information that was published was received from the individuals concerned and published without any research or efforts to substantiate the claims made by them. In fact the author has attributed Royal lineage to his patroness which is not even substantiated in the publication, and many of the individuals mentioned in this book were members of his patroness‚Äôs extended family who were wealthy merchants well established in Colombo. These included many guaranteed Shroffs, brokers and Merchants.

These included many guaranteed Shroffs, brokers and Merchants.  The Paraiyar Caste as repositories of genealogical Information  As mentioned earlier, the genealogies of the prominent families of Jaffna were known to the ‚ÄúParaiyar‚Äù community (drummer caste) of the respective villages from where the families originated, since they were the repositories of such information. During important festivals and family rituals, it was customary for members of this caste to visit the ‚Äúvalavus‚Äù (the manor houses) of their Ejamans (overlords), to beg for alms. They would greet the head of the household by addressing him by his family‚Äôs ancestral mudali name, followed by the words ‚ÄúNamo! Namo!‚Äù (hail! Hail!). Family genealogies were referred to at weddings and at funerals. At a Hindu wedding, during the recitation of the Koththiram (lineage), the officiating priest would proclaim three generations of the genealogy of the bridal couple. At Hindu Funerals it was customary to publish a document referred to as a Kalvettu, giving the genealogy of the deceased. Information for these purposes were most often obtained from the Paraiyar community. It also interesting to note that in Kalvettus most families whatever their cast and origins were would claim descent from the Cheras, Cholas, Pandyas or the Kings of Jaffna!!!

The theory says that aggression is the result of blocking, or frustrating, a person's efforts to attain a goal. When first formulated, the hypothesis stated that frustration always precedes aggression, and aggression is the sure consequence of frustration. Two years later, however, Miller and Sears APA re-formulated the hypothesis to suggest that while frustration creates a need to respond, some form of aggression is one possible outcome. Therefore, the re-formulated hypothesis stated that while frustration prompts a behavior that may or may not be aggressive, any aggressive behavior is the result of frustration, making frustration not sufficient, but a necessary condition for aggression. The hypothesis attempts to explain why people scapegoat. It attempts to give an explanation as to the cause of violence. According to Dollard and colleagues, frustration is the \\"condition which exists when a goal-response suffers interference\\", while aggression is defined as \\"an act whose goal-response is injury to an organism (or an organism surrogate)\\". The theory says that frustration causes aggression, but when the source of the frustration cannot be challenged, the aggression gets displaced onto an innocent target. For example, if a man is disrespected and humiliated at his work, but cannot respond to this for fear of losing his job, he may go home and take his anger and frustration out on his family. This theory is also used to explain riots and revolutions, which both are believed to be caused by poorer and more deprived sections of society who may express their bottled up frustration and anger through violence. While some researchers criticized the hypothesis and proposed moderating factors between frustration and aggression, several empirical studies were able to confirm it as is. APA APA In 1989, Berkowitz expanded on the hypothesis by suggesting that negative affect and personal attributions play a major role in whether frustration instigates aggressive behavior. APA  History  The frustration-aggression hypothesis emerged in 1939 through the form of a monograph published by the Yale University Institute of Human Relations. The Yale psychologists behind the monograph were John Dollard, Leonard Doob, Neal Miller, O. H Mowrer, and Robert Sears. The book is based on many studies conducted by the group that touched a variety of disciplines including psychology, anthropology and sociology. Marxism, psychoanalysis and behaviorism were used by the Yale group throughout their research. Their work, Frustration and Aggression (1939), was soon having repercussions on the explanation of aggressive behavior theories. Their theory applied to human beings, but also to animals. The book created controversy on the subject which led to more than 7 articles critiquing the new theory. The Psychological Review and the Reading in Social Psychology are two of the papers that published articles on the subject. Many social scientists disclaimed the rather strict definition of frustration reactions as well as how the frustration concept is defined in itself. By 1941, the Yale group modified their theory following the multiple critics and studies published by other psychologists. From there, many pioneers in the social science world modified and brought their knowledge to the original theory. In 1989 Berkowitz published an article, Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis: Examination and Reformulation, which addressed the inconsistency of empirical studies aiming to test the hypothesis, as well as its criticism. He proposed a modification to the hypothesis that would take into an account negative affect and individual attributions. More recently, Breuer and Elson published a comprehensive overview of the Frustration-Aggression Theory. The authors stated that despite an ample amount of empirical research that examines the link between frustration and aggressive behaviors, there is a decline in the number of studies that specifically refers to the frustration-aggression hypothesis. Breuer and Elson propose that there is utility in using the frustration-aggression hypothesis as a theoretical foundation for aggression literature and that this theory may have novel applications for other areas such as media psychology.  Reformulation and additions to the hypothesis  In 1941, the Yale group clarified their original statement which was \\"that the occurrence of aggressive behavior always presuppose the existence of frustration and, contrariwise, that the existence of frustration always lead to some form of aggression\\". As it was, the second part of this hypothesis lead readers to think that frustration could only have aggression as a consequence, and it did not allow the possibility that other responses could arise and override the aggression response. The Yale group thus reformulated the hypothesis as following: \\"frustration produces instigation to a number of different types of response, one of which is aggression\\". With this new formulation, the researchers left more place for the idea that aggressive impulses are not the only kinds that can emerge when an individual feels frustration. Other impulses, such as fear of punishment, can outweigh or even attenuate aggression instigations until it disappears, which would explain situations where frustration does not lead to outright aggression. In his article published in 1941, Gregory Bateson observed the frustration-aggression hypothesis under a cultural angle. According to him, culture was implicitly involved in the hypothesis itself, as it was dealing with human behaviour, which is always formed and influenced by the environment, be it social or cultural. He stated that it is easier to fit the hypothesis in people whose culture portray life as series of neutral or frustrating events that lead to satisfying ends. This would be the case for European culture and for Iatmul culture. However, it is harder to apply the hypothesis to the Balinese culture. Indeed, Balinese children are taught to take pleasure, satisfaction, in the steps that lead to their goals, without waiting for satisfaction climaxes by completion of such goals. Following the same line of thoughts, Arthur R. Cohen considered social norms to be an important factor in whether or not aggression will be following frustration. In 1955, he published results of a study he conducted, which included 60 female students, that showed that people were less likely to demonstrate aggression when social standards were stressed. Moreover, he built on what Doob and Sears' study previously claimed, which is that demonstration of aggressive behavior will depend on the anticipation of punishment. Indeed, Cohen's result showed that people were less likely to demonstrate aggression towards the frustration agent if the latter was an authoritative figure. He also investigated Nicholas Pastore's statement that aggression was more likely to follow in a context of an arbitrary context when compared to a non-arbitrary one, and reached the same conclusions. = Justification factor = The frustration‚Äìaggression theory has been studied since 1939, and there have been modifications. Dill and Anderson conducted a study investigating whether hostile aggression differs in justified vs. unjustified frustration conditions--compared to the control condition which would not induce frustration.. The study task required participants to learn and make an origami bird. The experimental procedure comprised an instruction phase and a folding phase. During the instruction phase, a participant paired with a confederate was shown how to fold a bird only one time. The folding phase was timed and each subject was required to make the bird alone as quickly and as accurately as possible. In all conditions, the experimenter started presenting the instructions in a deliberately fast manner. The conditions differed on how the experimenter responded to the confederate's request to slow down. In the non-frustration control condition, the experimenter apologized and slowed down. In the unjustified frustration condition, the experimenter revealed his desire to leave as quickly as possible due to personal reasons. In the justified frustration condition, the experimenter revealed a need to clear the room as fast as possible due to the supervisor demand. The subjects were then given questionnaires on their levels of aggression as well as questionnaires about the competence of the research staff. They were told that these questionnaires would determine whether the research staff would receive financial aid, or verbal reprimands and a reduction in financial awards. The questions presented on the questionnaire were designed to reflect the research staff's competence and likability. Dill and Anderson found that participants in the unjustified frustration condition rated the research staff as less able and less likable, knowing this would affect their financial situation as graduate students. The justified frustration group rated the staff as less likable and less competent than the control group, but higher on both rating scales than the unjustified condition participants. The authors concluded that unjustified frustration leads to greater level of aggression, compared to justified frustration, which, in turn, results in higher levels of aggression compared to the non- frustration situations. = Reformulation by Leonard Berkowitz = In 1964, Leonard Berkowitz stated that it is necessary to have an aggression stimulus to make aggression take place. Then in 1974 and 1993, he remodified the frustration/aggression hypothesis into a theory that removed the importance of aggressive cues to the aggressive behavior. Which is to say, extremely angry subject will show aggression even if the aggression cue is absent. The most provocative theory introduced by Berkowitz is \\"aggressive cues\\" hypothesis, stating that for young children, previous exposure to any objects or events such as military weapon toys showing destruction effects will work as aggressive cues to increase the chances of aggression behaviors. The modification of frustration/aggression hypothesis by Berkowitz discussed that the aggressive behavior originates from internal forces such as anger, aggressive habits and external stimuli. These theories help explain the reasons why aggression is evoked but didn't explain well the procedure of aggressive habits developments into aggressive stimuli. In his article published in 1980, Leonard Berkowitz further discussed the relationship between the frustration and the level of aggression by adding the differentiation between the internal and external reaction to the frustration. In his first part of experiment, he found that for both of the types of frustration (legitimate and illegitimate), compared to the control group which finished the task successfully, the internal reaction measured by heart rate and rating of three 21-step bipolar scales shows great level. Nevertheless, there is no significant difference of internal reaction between legitimate and illegitimate groups. For the 2nd part of the experiment, when previous 2 groups experiencing legitimate and illegitimate frustration, encounter an innocent partner in order to perform an unrelated task, the group with previous illegitimate frustration shows greater external reaction which is openly punitive actions towards the innocent partner than the group experiencing previous legitimate frustration does.  Neurobiological factors  Some studies have shown that frustrating and equally threatening events may generate feelings of aggression. This is based on the account that one of our neural systems is responsible for executing the basic responses to threat. It so happens that one of these basic responses from this system is that of aggression. The system is made up of and follows from the amygdala to the hypothalamus and finally to the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) In greater detail, research suggests that when one is threatened or frustrated by some stimuli, parts of our frontal cortex, that is our orbital, medial and ventrolateral frontal cortex, is activated which works in tandem with our threat response system, the amygdala-hypothalamus-PAG. More simply put, threatening events generate more action potentials in the frontal cortex regions which then relay onto the amygdala-hypothalamus-PAG. It is in this basic threat response system where the decision on which response should take hold based on the information received from the frontal cortex regions. As mentioned, there are varying degrees and responses that could take hold within an animal in the presence of a frustrating event. This has not shown to interfere with the basic circuitry at the neuronal level and simply implies that certain stimuli generate more action potentials than others, and thus stronger responses than others respectively. In the face of this, animals portray a response hierarchy at the onset of a frustrating event. For example, when low levels of danger are perceived, the threat response system induces freezing in the animal; closer subjects of threat generate the act of fleeing from their surroundings and finally, where the source of the threat is so close that escape is no longer an option, the threat circuitry system will induce reactive aggression in the animal. What this means is that the closer a frustrating stimulus is presented to us, the greater the chances our basic response systems will be activated and thus will give rise to certain behaviors accordingly. Furthermore, some research has shown that \\"individuals with elevated susceptibility for frustration [showed] greater activity within these regions [amygdala-hypothalarmus-PAG] in response to frustrating events relative to those with less susceptibility\\". What this research suggests is that people who get frustrated more easily than others show greater activity in the frontal cortex in connection with the amygdala-hypothalamus-PAG, the system that makes us act, given a strong enough stimulus, aggressively with reference to the studies at hand.  Empirical studies  One study by Williams examined the impact of violent content and frustration with game-play and assessed how these factors are related to aggressive personality (i.e., trait hostility). His study collected data from 150 male college undergraduates. The study consisted of two phases. The first phase lasted 45 minutes and was in a large group setting. During this phase participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires that assessed their video game playing habits and aggression. The second phase was a one-on-one session with each participant. During this phase participants played video games and were assigned to one of four conditions: 1) video game with violent content in low/nonfrustrating mode, 2) video game with violent content in frustrating mode, 3) video game with nonviolent content in low/nonfrustrating mode, and 4) video game with nonviolent content in frustration mode. As part of the frustrating conditions, participants were informed that their scores would be compared to other participants and that higher performance would be rewarded with a $100 gift card. Afterwards, participants completed a questionnaire similar to phase one. Ultimately, this study found that exposure to violent content influenced participants' aggressive responses when playing video games. He also found that frustration with gameplay was just as impactful, if not greater, on participants' aggressive responses. Participants who were exposed to violent content and presented frustration with game-play reported the highest scores in trait hostility. Another study by Shackman and Pollak tested the impact of physical maltreatment of children on their reactive aggression. The authors tested the relationships between individual differences in social information processing, history of physical maltreatment, and child negative affect and their aggressive behaviors. The study collected data from 50 boys through the Madison, Wisconsin Public Schools. Within this sample, 17 children had a history of physical maltreatment. Families attended two separate sessions in the laboratory. The first session involved the children completing an emotional oddball task while having their neural responses recorded via event-related potentials (ERPs). After this task, parents and children participated in a semistructured dyadic interaction, which involved the researchers assessment of child-directed parental hostility during a 10-minute interaction. Families then returned to the laboratory between 2 and 20 days for the second session of the experiment. The second session asked children to participate in a provocation task, which was designed to evoke a reactive aggression response. All families were paid $50 for their participation and were debriefed. The authors reported that physically maltreated children displayed greater negative affect and aggressive behavior compared to children that were not physically maltreated. This relationship was mediated by the children's attention to angry faces, as measured by the ERP. Ultimately, these findings suggest that physical maltreatment of children leads to child dysregulation of their negative affect and aggression. Criticism The publication of Frustration and Aggression gave rise to criticism from several scientists, including animal behaviorists, psychologists, and psychiatrists. For example, Seward, who studied rat behavior, suggested that aggression can also be caused by dominance struggles, which for him were different from frustration. APA Durbin and Bowlby, by observing apes and children, placed reasons for breaking of a fight into three different categories. While one of the categories was frustration, the other two were classified as possession disputes and resentment of a stranger intrusion. Addressing this criticism, Berkowitz suggested that the controversy around the frustration-aggression hypothesis has its roots in the lack of a common definition for frustration. He advocated that if frustration is defined as a reaction to a blocking of a drive or an interruption of some internal response sequence, those various reasons for aggression actually fall under the frustration umbrella. Later research was focused more on refining the hypothesis, rather than on denying its correctness. In one of the earlier studies, following the publication of Dollard et al.'s book, Pastore argued APA that the hypothesis should distinguish between arbitrary and non-arbitrary situations, as non-arbitrary situations decrease the aggressiveness of response. In this study, participants from a sample of 131 college students were presented with the verbal description of two types of situations, arbitrary and non-arbitrary. One of the arbitrary situation examples was being intentionally passed by the bus driver, while waiting at the correct bus stops. A non-arbitrary situation was described in one of the examples as being passed by the bus, while it was specifically marked as heading for a garage. The study results suggested that arbitrariness of the situation is an important factor in eliciting aggressive behavior in frustrating situations, with arbitrary situations inducing more aggression. Building on Pastore's work, in his 1955 empirical study, Cohen confirmed APA that the arbitrariness of a situation affects the level of aggressiveness. However, the study also supported his hypothesis that two more factors need to be accounted for in the frustration-aggression hypothesis. Those factors are social norms and the relationship with the frustrating agent. In his study, 60 volunteer participants were rating 14 statements on the levels of predicted aggressiveness. Cohen found that people tend to respond less aggressively if the frustrating agent is an authority figure, rather than a friend and that people respond to frustration with less aggression if the socially accepted norms require to do so. Berkowitz addressed this criticism in his 1989 article and proposed that frustration, and ultimately aggression, is induced when individuals think they have been deliberately and wrongly kept from their goal. Some sources suggest that there is little empirical support for it, even though researchers have studied it for more than sixty years. Also, this theory suggests frustrated, prejudiced individuals should act more aggressively towards out-groups they are prejudiced against, but studies have shown that they are more aggressive towards everyone. The frustration- aggression hypothesis implies that aggression is followed or triggered by a feeling of frustration as proposed by the Yale group. Yet, other studies support contradictory claims. Certain subjects in some studies have shown to not respond aggressively to frustration given their personal, moral and educational backgrounds. For instance, the Indian culture uses the Satyagraha, which means \\"non-violent resistance\\" to a trigger. Mahatma Gandhi exemplified this technique that essentially denounces the principles of the frustration- aggression theory in that he restrained himself from feeling these innate desires. Indeed, the hypothesis does not take into consideration the individuality of human beings. According to Dixon and Johnson, two people can respond differently to the same frustration stimuli. For instance, some could respond aggressively while driving on the highway after being cut off by another car, whereas others with a different temperament could not react to it. However, the theory assumes that if two different people receive the same frustration stimuli, they will react similarly or equally aggressively The Yale group's hypothesis does not explain why aggressive behavior could be manifested in different social environments without previous provocation or feeling of frustration. However, according to Gross and Osterman, people may lose their sense of uniqueness in mass societal contexts because it tends to deindividuate them. For instance, individuals may behave aggressively when they are with their friends or in a big crowd (e.g. while watching a hockey game), but might not behave aggressively when they are by themselves (e.g. watching the game alone at home). When individuals are in a crowd, they are more likely to become desensitised of their own actions and less likely to take responsibility. This phenomenon is known as deindividuation.

In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs.

History =Peterborough County School for Girls= The school which was to become Peterborough County Grammar School for Girls opened on 17 September 1904 as a pupil teachers training centre in four rooms of the County Technical School in Broadway, with Miss Wragge as Headmistress. In 1907, the school became Peterborough Girls Secondary School and moved to Park Road. In 1911 the school changed its name to Peterborough County School for Girls and a new school building, designed by Annesley Brownrigg, was built on the corner of Lincoln Road (then the A15) and Cobden Avenue, near the junction with Burghley Road. =PCGS= In 1944 the school became Peterborough County Grammar School, administered by the Peterborough Joint Education Board, later the Peterborough City Education Committee. The Chairman of the Governors, Jack Hunt, would have a school named after him. The New Hall was built in 1955, and new science labs were built in 1956. National hockey matches were played on the sports pitch.
