One of Williams's most notable works is her ambitious Cineshape series of chamber pieces inspired by different films. This was presented in May 2016 with live performances by the JACK Quartet, flautist Lindsey Goodman and percussionist Scott Christian, with a new video component by Aaron Henderson.  Education  Williams began playing piano at the age of four and took up the flute a few years later with Robert Dick. Throughout her childhood, she was exposed to the latest contemporary music performed at the Center for the Creative and Performing Arts, meeting composers who would later become great influences on her own works, including John Cage, Morton Feldman, Lukas Foss and Elliott Carter. She made the decision to devote her life to performing and composing contemporary music whilst studying at Bennington College and after a fellowship year in Denmark, she completed a master's degree in piano performance at the University at Buffalo with pianist-composer Yvar Mikhashoff. She also completed a Ph.D. in composition from the State University of New York, working primarily with David Felder, Charles Wuorinen and Nils Vigeland. She returned to Bennington in 1998 as a member of the music faculty and moved on to a faculty position at Northwestern University in 2000. Since 2005, she has been teaching composition and theory at the University of Pittsburgh, where she is an associate professor.  The Bugallo-Williams Piano Duo  Williams formed the Bugallo-Williams Piano Duo with Helena Bugallo, while both were graduate students at the University at Buffalo. The Duo has been featured at important contemporary music festivals and series throughout Europe and the Americas, including the Ojai Festival, CAL Performances (California), Miller Theatre, Symphony Space, Le Poisson Rouge (New York), Musica Contemporanea Ciclos de Conciertos (Buenos Aires), Festival Attacca (Stuttgart), Palacio de Bellas Artes (Mexico City), Warsaw Autumn Festival, Cologne Triennale, and Wittener T√§ge f√ºr Neue Kammermusik. The duo's debut CD of Conlon Nancarrow‚Äôs complete music for solo piano and piano duet (Wergo, 2004) garnered much critical acclaim. Wergo released the duo's second CD (music of Stravinsky) in 2007 and their third (music of Morton Feldman and Edgard Var√®se) in 2009. Their recording of the complete piano duets of Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g was released in 2015 and the second volume of Stravinsky transcriptions is forthcoming in early 2018, also on Wergo.

Together with her husband Hinrich, she founded Greenland's first newspaper, Atuagagdliutit, in 1861. She is credited as being the first woman to publish works on Greenland and its culture. Biography Born on 24 January 1836 in Paamiut, Nathalie Sophia Nielsine Caroline M√∏ller was the daughter of the Danish colonial administrator J√∏rgen Nielsen M√∏ller (1801‚Äì62) and his wife Antonette Ernestine Constance Tommerup (1813‚Äì91). She was brought up in Greenland until about 1850 when she was sent to school in Denmark. When she was just 17, she married the Danish geographer and Greenland researcher Hinrich Rink. The couple lived in Greenland where Hinrich became government inspector in Nuuk. They associated with people such as the linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt and the educator Carl Janssen who were interested in the Greenlanders and their culture. In 1868, Rink left Greenland as her husband was suffering from poor health. They took with them a collection of illustrations of folk tales depicting the everyday lives of native Greenlanders created by Aron of Kangeq in which Signe Rink had taken a special interest. She later donated the collection to the National Museum of Denmark. Aron's watercolours, which also formed an important part of the collection, were rediscovered in 1960 and transferred to the National Museum of Greenland. After first settling in Copenhagen, they moved to Kristiania in 1883. It was here that Signe Rink found time to write, publishing Gr√∏nl√¶ndere (1886), Gr√∏nl√¶ndere og Danske i Gr√∏nland (1887), Koloni-Idyller fra Gr√∏nland (1888) and Fra det Gr√∏nland der gik (1902).

Middle Chinese was the prestige language of Tang Empire (7th to 10th century) and Song Empire (10th to 13th century). The works of literature from these dynasties (such as Tang poetry) have been considered some of the best works of literature from all of Chinese dynasties. Due to its closeness to Middle Chinese, Cantonese language is very useful for studying these great works of literature. This is reflected by the fact that most Tang poems will rhyme better if chanted using Cantonese.ÁÇ∫‰ªÄÈ∫ºÊúâÊôÇÂÄôÊôÆÈÄöË©±ËÆÄË©©Ë©û‰∏çÊäºÈüªÔºåËÄåÁî®Á≤µË™ûËÆÄÂçªÂæàÊúâÂë≥ÈÅìÔºü Lingnan school of poetry Zeung Gau- ling (Jyutping: Zoeng1 gau2 ling4; Traditional Chinese: Âºµ‰πùÈΩ¢) was a poet of the Tang Empire, and he was born and raised in what is modern day's Gwongdung.Ê§çÊú®‰πÖË°å.

He has been considered the earliest Cantonese poet (although strictly speaking, Cantonese languages had not yet fully formed at that time). In the centuries that followed, there have been numerous poets of varying levels of prominence from the area of Gwongdung, resulting in the formation of Lingnan school of poetry (Jyutping: Ling5 naam4 si1 paai3; Traditional Chinese: Â∂∫ÂçóË©©Ê¥æ), named after \\"Lingnan\\", an archaic name for what is modern day Cantonese provinces of Gwongdung and Gwongsai. Stylistically, this school has been noted for having two streams of poetry: On one hand, there were poets like Zeung Gau-ling, who preferred to follow royal standards at that time, while poets like Siu kit (Jyutping: Siu6 kit3; Traditional Chinese: ÈÇµË¨Å) composed poems marked by little use of rhetoric. Both streams, however, composed poetry using classical Chinese grammars - while these poems still tend to use Cantonese phonology, they certainly do not sound like everyday Cantonese speech. Aside from this, this school is noted for maintaining Middle Chinese pronunciations for Chinese characters, involving imagery unique to the Lingnan region, and a spirit of revolution. This style has been described as \\"magnificent and vigorous\\" (Jyutping: Hung4 zik6; Traditional Chinese: ÈõÑÁõ¥).ÈªÑÂù§Â∞ß. (2012). ‚ÄúÂ≤≠ÂçóËØóÊ¥æ‚Äù Áõ∏ÂØπËÆ∫. Â≠¶ÊúØÁ†îÁ©∂, (3), 124-126. In terms of formats, the Lingnan school of poetry is largely similar to poems composed by other Han Chinese groups. Ming Dynasty development The term \\"Lingnan school of poetry\\" was first coined by the Ming Dynasty (14th to 17th century) scholar Wu Ying-loen.ÈôàÊ∞∏Ê≠£. (1999). Â≤≠ÂçóËØóÊ¥æÁï•ËÆ∫.

In 17th century (late Ming period), there were the \\"three great experts of Lingnan\\" (Jyutping: Ling5 naam4 saam1 gaa1; Traditional Chinese: Â∂∫Âçó‰∏âÂÆ∂),‰ΩïÂ§©Êù∞. (2007).

Â≠¶ÊúØÁ†îÁ©∂, (4), 150-154. who advocated greater realism in Chinese-language poetry - they composed poetry that depicted the hardship faced by average peasants. This was considered quite unorthodox at that time. Vernacular Cantonese poetry Cantonese poetry saw further development in late 19th century, where the Cantonese poet Liu Yan-tou (Jyutping: Liu6 jan1 tou4; Traditional Chinese: ÂªñÊÅ©Ááæ; 1863-1954) composed poetry in vernacular Cantonese language - poems that actually sound like everyday Cantonese speech. His works have seen a rise in popularity among Cantonese in recent years, compiled in the \\"Play and smile collection\\". (Jyutping: Hei1 siu3 zaap6; Traditional Chinese: Â¨âÁ¨ëÈõÜ).

Its aims were \\"to preserve 'native lore' for posterity and to win 'the incurious and indifferent into an interest for Wales'.\\" It ran from 1829 to 1833.  History  The principal founder of the magazine was Rice Pryce Buckley Williames who also served as its first editor. His co-proprietor was Anthony Ashley Cooper, later Lord Shaftsbury. Thomas Price, a cleric and historian who was instrumental in reviving the Eisteddfod, was also a founder. The magazine was promoted by county court judge Arthur James Johnes. Noting the failure of previous efforts \\"to preserve and bring into notice the valuable relics of Welsh genius\\" because they sought to \\"interest the minds of Welshmen alone\\", the magazine's founders hoped to broaden its appeal by \\"making it interesting and pleasing to the general reader\\" (i.e. both Welsh and English).

As well as Williames and Price, contributors included John Jenkins, William Owen Pughe, Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, and Gwallter Mechain. Although it received positive reviews and support in the Welsh and London newspapers, the magazine closed in October 1833 after a run of five volumes of four issues each.

Life Early years Eusebius was born around the year 1200 in Esztergom, Esztergom County, Hungary.\\"Blessed Eusebius of Esztergom', Penrose Park According to Gergely Gy√∂ngy√∂si's book The life of the hermit brothers of I Saint Paul the Hermit (Vitae fratrum Eremitarum Ordinis Sancti Pauli Primi Eremitae, 1496) Eusebius came from a well-known Hungarian family. C√©cile Tormay states that Eusebius was a relative of the royal family of the Hungarian Kingdom. It can be found in other sources that he was the son of the granger of the royal court. As a child, Eusebius had shown his deep religious faith and an ability to learn. He spent a lot of time in prayer and contemplation. He studied in the Seminar of Esztergom to become a priest. Later, he was named canon in Esztergom County, and distributed his prebend among the poor.\\"Blessed Eusebius of Esztergom\\", The Australian Province of the Order Of Saint Paul The First Hermit In his spare time he wrote books. Even the names of these books did not survive. But according to Gy√∂ngy√∂si these works were written on canon law. At that time Eusebius was often visited by hermits from the Pilis Mountains who sold him wattled baskets in exchange for bread. Eusebius also visited them personally several times. The life of these hermits aroused his interest and he desired to become a hermit, but his plans were delayed by the Mongol invasion of Europe. He remained at his post, helping to rebuild the country. Hermit The cave of Eusebius in the Pilis Mountains In 1246, Eusebius received permission from his bishop, Stephen I B√°ncsa to become a hermit. He settled in a cave north of Pilissz√°nt√≥ and placed a large wooden cross in front of the entrance of his cave where he prayed and meditated. One night during prayer Eusebius saw in the whole Pilis Mountains, deep in the forest, many tiny flames which moved towards him and they joined near his cross forming a huge flame. From the cross he heard the words: \\"‚ÄúEusebius, summon all the hermits and found a monastic community. The love present in each will be the bond that will unite you and enable each to give loving service.‚Äù\\"Blessed Eusebius\\", Marian Valley Eusebius founded the first Hungarian order in 1250 which later became the Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit. He and his companion hermits erected their first monastery in honor of the Saint Cross next to the cave. At that time there were several hermit communities in Hungary who lived disorganized away from society. Eusebius became their priest, and as a well-educated, canon law expert became their leader. Eusebius then started to travel around the country to find other hermit communities. His first route led him to the hermits of Jakab-hegy, Baranya County who since 1225 lived according to the Regula of Bartholomew le Gros, the Bishop of P√©cs. The two monasteries united and the hermits chose Eusebius as the head of the order. Paul of Thebes became their patron. They called themselves the Brothers of I Saint Paul the Hermit.\\"The Pauline Monks ‚Äì yesterday and today\\", Niedziela Tygodnik Katoliki, May 2008 Their other name was the Brothers of the Saint Cross from the name of their first monastery. Many people joined his order and adopted his strict rule. Their parents and friends tried to dissuade them, but Eusebius said to them: \\"Christ loved his mother very much, but with his suffering his mother was tormented by the pain of his pain. He could have got off the cross, but he did not do it because he had fulfilled the will of his Heavenly Father. Likewise, we do not want to get off the cross of penance because people cry for us.\\" On the 1256 National Council of Esztergom, Eusebius wrote his name as the First Provincial of the Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit. In 1262 he went to Rome with his companions to meet Pope Urban IV to ask him for approval for founding his own order. He had the support of Thomas Aquinas and Stephen I B√°ncsa. The pope first refused to give Eusebius his permission because of financial conditions and asked Paul Balog, the Bishop of Veszpr√©m to examine the monasteries. During Eusebius' life, there were 16 monasteries of his order. Later this number reached 150. Eusebius served for 20 years as provincial. As he felt that his death is near he gathered his companions around him, blessed them and calmly died on the 20 January 1270. Papal legate Cardinal Gentilis de Monte Florido gave the order the Rule of St Augustine, and it received approval with the decree ‚ÄòQui saecularia‚Äô, issued in Buda on 13 December 1308.

It refers to the acquisition of the status of citizenship through an exceptional (economic) contribution to the issuing country, and, by extension, a contribution to the welfare, advancement and economic development of the host state. Ius doni is thus a specific sub-type of naturalization. The term ius doni was introduced by immigration and citizenship law specialist Christian K√§lin, pioneer of the citizenship by investment industry, in his research on the topic. K√§lin introduced the concept into the contemporary legal and political theory of citizenship by providing the first comprehensive analysis of the subject, discussing the historical, legal and political concepts of citizenship.  Etymology  The term derives from the Latin expression for a gift or present (d≈çnum/gen. d≈çnƒ´) and the right (ius/pl. iura) to citizenship by making a donation or investing in the host state.  Background  It has been widely accepted that the historical origins of citizenship date back to Ancient Greece, but citizenship and citizenship law, as we understand them today, came into existence along with the formation of modern nation-states in the 18th and 19th centuries. Ius doni, as a specific mode of citizenship acquisition, is a result of social transformation. The gradual development of citizenship from a more formal structure to a subjective right was precipitated by the French Revolution. This transition from the birthright principle (ius soli) to the principle of descent (ius sanguinis) represented a significant paradigm shift brought about by the Code Civil in 1804. This transition ultimately extended to all of Europe. Australia, Canada, the US, and even the UK to some extent, are all examples of countries that have traditionally relied on citizenship laws that follow the ius soli principle. Today they have become known as classical immigration countries. This shift was engendered by the realization that communities can be strengthened by further developing national citizenship laws to benefit both the social and the economic state of a nation. Ius doni is becoming increasingly popular around the world. The design of new citizenship laws governing states such as Austria, Malta, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Cyprus, for example, illustrates the possibility of acquiring additional citizenship by making significant contributions to the local community and, in so doing, contributing to the welfare of the country. The IMF has come to the same conclusion in several reports, stating that Citizenship by Investment programmes, if managed properly, can become a major socio-economic contributor to developing states.  Ius doni and the State  Citizenship is a complex institution with various dimensions. Its conception and definition depend on one‚Äôs political viewpoint, which can be defined as the legal counterpart of the sociopolitical concept of nationality. From a legal perspective, citizenship is mainly a classification criterion: it classifies natural persons as belonging to a particular state, generating a legal bond, and gives individuals civil, political and social rights. In principle, every state has the right to exclude whomever it wishes from entering and settling in its territory; likewise, every state has the right to regulate its naturalization laws in accordance with the common good and to include whomever it wishes to admit as citizens. Ius doni, which could be viewed as the granting of citizenship for the common good, is thus an expression of the individual state‚Äôs freedom to select and choose suitable individuals and families who would contribute to its economy and society.

Quantum image is encoding the image information in quantum-mechanical systems instead of classical ones and replacing classical with quantum information processing may alleviate some of these challenges. Humans obtain most of their information through their eyes. Accordingly, the analysis of visual data is one of the most important functions of our brain and it has evolved high efficiency in processing visual data. Currently, visual information like images and videos constitutes the largest part of data traffic in the internet. Processing of this information requires ever-larger computational power. The laws of quantum mechanics allow one to reduce the required resources for some tasks by many orders of magnitude if the image data are encoded in the quantum state of a suitable physical system. The researchers discuss a suitable method for encoding image data, and develop a new quantum algorithm that can detect boundaries among parts of an image with a single logical operation. This edge- detection operation is independent of the size of the image. Several other algorithms are also discussed. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that they work in practice. This is the first experiment to demonstrate practical quantum image processing.

In April 1943, she entered the Marine Corps and was assigned to the first Marine Corps Women's Reserve Officer Training Class at Mt. Holyoke, Massachusetts. On completing the course, she was commissioned a first lieutenant in the Women's Reserve, 4 May 1943. She was selected as adjutant to then-Captain (later Colonel) Katherine A. Towle at the Women's Recruit Training Center at Hunter College in New York. During subsequent tours of duty, she served at bases in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina; Camp Pendleton, California; and at Quantico, Virginia.

However, two months later she was recalled to Headquarters Marine Corps (Washington, D.C.) as a major, to serve as the third director of the Women's Reserve, from September 1946 to November 1948, succeeding Towle. With the passage of the Women's Armed Forces Integration Act in 1948, a transfer of personnel into the regular components of the Marine Corps with the title of Women Marines was effectuated. Hamblet accepted a regular commission as a major in the Women Marines on 4 November 1948. On 24 August 1949, she was promoted to lieutenant colonel.Obituary: Colonel Julia E. Hamblet, washingtonpost.com; accessed 26 September 2017. In 1951, after completing graduate work at Ohio State University, she was assigned to the staff of the commander, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, with headquarters in Hawaii. The following year, she was named officer in charge of the Women Officers Training Detachment, Marine Corps Schools, Quantico. On 1 May 1953, she assumed duty as director of Women Marines, again succeeding Colonel Towle, who was retiring. The post carried with it the rank of colonel; Hamblet continued to serve in that capacity when her four-year tour of duty was extended to 1 March 1959. Later that same month, she was assigned duty in Naples, Italy, as military secretary to the Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces, Southern Europe. In May 1962, upon her return from Italy, she reported to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, as commanding officer, Women's Recruit Training Battalion, and served in this capacity until her retirement three years later.

G-jitter references forms of periodic or quasisteady residual acceleration encountered in a spacecraft floating through the micro-gravity confines of space. Such variations slightly change the orientation and magnitude of a body force in a low-gravity testing environment,Nelson, Emily S. \\"An examination of anticipated g-jitter on space station and its effects on materials processes.\\" (1994). https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19950006290 which can either marginally or gravely affect the result of precision-heavy dependent experiments conducted on board a space station. These accelerations are often the result of routine crew activity and equipment operation and the aerodynamic and aeromechanical forces on the spacecraft itself. Using current theoretical methods and previously collected experimental data, it is impossible to predict the exact behavior of a g-jitter acceleration, but with the aforementioned data, it is possible to notice and account for qualitative trends that hold true for most scenarios pertaining to material science testing on board a space station.  Sources of G-jitter   Quasi-steady forces  Constant forces that last over 10 minutes while varying periodically in a single frequency can provide a noticeable offset in acceleration readings and deviate a testing environment from \\"true\\" micro-gravity. The stronger set of these forces result in non- negligible tidal accelerations and the varying aerodynamic drag of the space station, which fluctuates over the course of an orbit due to the changes in the space station's aspect angle, diurnal cycle, and variable solar activity.Alexander, J.I.D. and Lundquist, C.A. \\"Motion in fluids caused by microgravitational acceleration and their modification by relative rotation.\\" AIAA J 26:34-39 (1988). In some fringe cases, Euler accelerations must be accounted for as they affect low-pressure physical vapor transport. Coriolis accelerations and solar radiation pressure can be also observed, but are generally negligible in comparison to the effects of other quasi-steady forces.  Oscillatory disturbances  Generally, if an disturbance can be replicated by a sinusoidal modulation, it is considered to be an oscillatory component of g-jitter. The most noticeable disturbances being routine crew activity and structural vibrations, and can cause a structural resonance throughout a space vehicle. While the average frequency of the structural vibration of a space station is lesser than a Space Shuttle orbiter, the frequency range can still be between the ranges of 0.1 to 1 Hz.  Transient disturbances  The largest in magnitude are likely to be caused by thruster firings, Shuttle dockings or berthings, and mass translations. Some disruptions can be controlled and timed as to not affect on-site testing, such as thruster firings and Shuttle dockings. The relatively innocuous routinely activities astronauts conduct in a space station ranging from maintenance or moving freely around the station add onto a category of impermanent disturbances that are more spontaneous and unpredictable, which cannot be as easily accounted for.  Preventing G-jitter  Due to the rise in the awareness of the implications of g-jitter, accelerometers with capabilities to attune to a hectic low-gravity environment have begun to be incorporated within space vehicles. Past experiments conducted in the Space Shuttle environment have served as a base to correlate g-jitter's effects to testing in material science and numerically model the residual acceleration to help devise specific experiments for a particular environment. Methods for the analysis of acceleration readings are readily available, but the difficult task of shifting through all the raw data can be facilitated by keeping a timeline of the recorded events and correlate them to a respective residual acceleration.Rogers, M.J.B. and Alexander, J.I.D. \\"A strategy for residual acceleration data reduction and dissemination--from orbiting space laboratories\\".

By 2017, the lander was to be launched in 2021, but this has been subsequently delayed to January 2022 due to delays in SLIM's rideshare mission, XRISM. = Artemis 1 = Artemis 1 is an upcoming uncrewed flight test for NASA's Artemis program that is the first integrated flight of the agency's Orion MPCV and Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket. Formerly known as Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), the mission was renamed after the introduction of the Artemis program. The launch will be held at Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center, where an Orion spacecraft will be sent on a mission of 25.5 days, 6 of those days in a retrograde orbit around the Moon. The mission will certify the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket for crewed flights beginning with the second flight test of the Orion and Space Launch System, Artemis 2 in September 2022, which will carry a crew of four around the Moon in a week-long mission and back prior to the assembly of the Lunar Gateway in lunar orbit, which will occur between 2022 and 2023.  Mars  = Rosalind Franklin = Rosalind Franklin, previously known as the ExoMars rover, is a planned robotic Mars rover, part of the international ExoMars programme led by the European Space Agency and the Russian Roscosmos State Corporation. Initially scheduled to launch in July 2020, but has since been delayed due to testing issues with the rover‚Äôs landing mechanism. The new launch date is set for July 2022. the plan calls for a Russian launch vehicle, an ESA carrier module, and a Russian lander named Kazachok, that will deploy the rover to Mars' surface. Once safely landed, the solar powered rover will begin a seven-month (218-sol) mission to search for the existence of past life on Mars. The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), launched in 2016, will operate as Rosalind Franklins and lander's data-relay satellite. = Mars 2020 = Computer-design drawing for NASA's Perseverance rover Mars 2020 is a Mars rover mission by NASA's Mars Exploration Program that includes the Perseverance rover which launched on 30 July 2020 at 11:50 UTC, and has a scheduled touch down in Jezero crater on Mars on 18 February 2021. It will investigate an astrobiologically relevant ancient environment on Mars and investigate its surface geological processes and history, including the assessment of its past habitability, the possibility of past life on Mars, and the potential for preservation of biosignatures within accessible geological materials. It will cache sample containers along its route for a potential future Mars sample-return mission. The Mars 2020 mission was announced by NASA on 4 December 2012 at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The Perseverance rover's design is derived from the Curiosity rover, and will use many components already fabricated and tested, new scientific instruments and a core drill. It will also carry a helicopter drone. = Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover = The Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover (HX-1) is a planned project by China to deploy an orbiter and rover on Mars. The mission is planned to be launched in July or August 2020 with a Long March 5 heavy lift rocket. Its stated objectives are to search for evidence of both current and past life, and to assess the planet's environment.The subsurface penetrating radar on the rover of China's Mars 2020 mission. B.

As per some reports emerged, the mission was to be an orbiter to Mars proposed for 2024. Alt URL However, in a recorded interview in October 2019, VSSC director has indicated the inclusion of a lander and rover. The orbiter will use aerobraking to lower its initial apoapsis and enter into an orbit more suitable for observations. = Hope Mars Mission = The Hope Mars Mission is a space exploration probe mission to Mars built by the United Arab Emirates and set for launch in 2020. Upon launch, it will become the first mission to Mars by any Arab or Muslim majority country. The probe will study the Martian atmosphere and provide details regarding the daily climate and through seasonal cycles, the weather events in the lower atmosphere such as dust storms, as well as the weather on Mars different geographic areas. The probe will attempt to answer the scientific community questions of why Mars atmosphere is losing hydrogen and oxygen into space and the reason behind Mars drastic climate changes.  Asteroids  An article in science magazine Nature suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, \\"a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit\\"; second, \\"extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars\\"; and finally, \\"developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin.\\" Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure The spacecraft's path (green) is shown in a frame of reference where Jupiter remains stationary. Lucy has two close Earth flybys before encountering its Trojan targets. After 2033, Lucy will continue cycling between the two Trojan clouds every six years. = Lucy = Lucy, part of NASA's Discovery Program, is scheduled to launch in October 2021 to explore six Trojan Asteroids and a Main Belt asteroid. The two Trojan swarms ahead of and behind Jupiter are thought to be dark bodies made of the same material as the outer planets that were pulled into orbit near Jupiter. Lucy will be the first mission to study the Trojans, and scientists hope the findings from this mission will revolutionize our knowledge of the formation of the solar system. For this reason, the project is named after Lucy, a fossilized hominid that provided insight on the evolution of humans. The asteroids studied are ancient fossils of planet formation which could hold clues to the origins of life on Earth. = Psyche = The Psyche spacecraft, part of NASA's Discovery Program, is scheduled to launch at the end of 2022 to 16 Psyche, a metallic object in the asteroid belt. 16 Psyche is 130 miles (210 km) wide, and it is made almost entirely of iron and nickel instead of ice and rock. Because of this unique composition, scientists believe it is the remnants of a planet's core that lost its exterior through a series of collisions, but it is possible that 16 Psyche is only unmelted material. NASA hopes to obtain information about planetary formation from directly studying the exposed interior of a planetary body, which would otherwise not be possible. = OSIRIS-REx = The OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer) is a NASA asteroid study and sample-return mission.  The mission's main goal is to obtain a sample of at least from 101955 Bennu, a carbonaceous near-Earth asteroid, and return the sample to Earth for a detailed analysis. The material returned is expected to enable scientists to learn more about the formation and evolution of the Solar System, its initial stages of planet formation, and the source of organic compounds that led to the formation of life on Earth. If successful, OSIRIS- REx will be the first U.S. spacecraft to return samples from an asteroid. The Lidar instrument used aboard the OSIRIS-REx was built by Lockheed Martin, in conjunction with the Canadian Space Agency. OSIRIS-REx was launched on 8 September 2016, flew past Earth on 22 September 2017, and reached the proximity of Bennu on 3 December 2018, where it began analyzing its surface for a target sample area over the next several months. It is expected to return with its sample to Earth on 24 September 2023.  Gas Giants  = JUICE = The JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) is an interplanetary spacecraft in development by the European Space Agency (ESA) with Airbus Defence and Space as the main contractor. The mission is being developed to visit the Jovian system focused on studying three of Jupiter's Galilean moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa (excluding the more volcanically active Io) all of which are thought to have significant bodies of liquid water beneath their surfaces, making them potentially habitable environments. The spacecraft is set for launch in June 2022 and would reach Jupiter in October 2029 after five gravity assists and 88 months of travel. By 2033 the spacecraft should enter orbit around Ganymede for its close up science mission and becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than the moon of Earth. = Europa Clipper = Animation of Europa Clipper trajectory around Jupiter Europa Clipper (previously known as Europa Multiple Flyby Mission) is an interplanetary mission in development by NASA comprising an orbiter. Set for a launch in 2025,Europa Clipper passes key review. Jeff Foust, Space News. 22 August 2019. the spacecraft is being developed to study the Galilean moon Europa through a series of flybys while in orbit around Jupiter. This mission is a scheduled flight of the Planetary Science Division, designated a Large Strategic Science Mission, and funded under the Planetary Missions Program Office's Solar System Exploration program as its second flight. It is also supported by the new Ocean Worlds Exploration Program. Europa Clipper will perform follow-up studies to those made by the Galileo spacecraft during its eight years in Jupiter orbit, which indicated the existence of a subsurface ocean underneath Europa's ice crust. Plans to send a spacecraft to Europa were initially conceived with projects such as Europa Orbiter and Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, in which a spacecraft would be injected into orbit around Europa. However, due to the adverse effects of radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere in Europan orbit, it was decided that it would be safer to inject a spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around Jupiter and make 45 close flybys of the moon instead. The mission began as a joint investigation between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Applied Physics Laboratory. = Breakthrough Enceladus = Breakthrough Enceladus is an astrobiology space probe mission concept to explore the possibility of life on Saturn's moon, Enceladus. In September 2018, NASA signed a collaboration agreement with Breakthrough to jointly create the mission concept. This mission would be the first privately funded deep space mission. It would study the content of the plumes ejecting from Enceladus's warm ocean through its southern ice crust. Enceladus's ice crust is thought to be around two to five kilometers thick, and a probe could use an ice-penetrating radar to constrain its structure.  Space telescopes  = CHEOPS = CHEOPS (Characterising Exoplanets Satellite) is a planned European space telescope for the study of the formation of extrasolar planets. The launch window for CHEOPS is the fourth quarter of 2019. The mission aims to bring an optical Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien telescope with an aperture of 30 cm, mounted on a standard small satellite platform, into a Sun-synchronous orbit of about altitude. For the planned mission duration of 3.5 years, CHEOPS is to examine known transiting exoplanets orbiting bright and nearby stars. = PLATO = Planetary Transits and Oscillations of Stars (PLATO) is a space telescope under development by the European Space Agency for launch in 2026.PLATO spacecraft to find new Earth-like exoplanets. June 21, 2017, Max Planck Society. The mission goals are to search for planetary transits across up to one million stars, and to discover and characterize rocky extrasolar planets around yellow dwarf stars (like our sun), subgiant stars, and red dwarf stars. The emphasis of the mission is on earth-like planets in the habitable zone around sun-like stars where water can exist in liquid state. It is the third medium-class mission in ESA's Cosmic Vision programme and named after the influential Greek philosopher Plato, the founding figure of Western philosophy, science and mathematics. A secondary objective of the mission is to study stellar oscillations or seismic activity in stars to measure stellar masses and evolution and enabling the precise characterization of the planet host star, including its age. = James Webb Space Telescope = The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or \\"Webb\\") is a space telescope that is planned to be the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The JWST will provide greatly improved resolution and sensitivity over the Hubble, and will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe, such as the formation of the first galaxies. Other goals include understanding the formation of stars and planets, and direct imaging of exoplanets and novas. The primary mirror of the JWST, the Optical Telescope Element, is composed of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium which combine to create a diameter mirror that is much larger than the Hubble's mirror. Unlike the Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared (0.1 to 1 Œºm) spectra, the JWST will observe in a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light through mid-infrared (0.6 to 27 Œºm), which will allow it to observe high redshift objects that are too old and too distant for the Hubble to observe. The telescope must be kept very cold in order to observe in the infrared without interference, so it will be deployed in space near the Earth‚ÄìSun Lagrangian point, and a large sunshield made of silicon- and aluminum-coated Kapton will keep its mirror and instruments below .  Crewed missions   Commercial Crew Development  Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) is a human spaceflight development program that is funded by the U.S. government and administered by NASA. CCDev will result in US and international astronauts flying to the International Space Station (ISS) on privately operated crew vehicles. Operational contracts to fly astronauts were awarded in September 2014 to SpaceX and Boeing. Test flights of Dragon 2 and CST-100 are scheduled for 2019. Pending completion of the demonstration flights, each company is contracted to supply six flights to ISS between 2019 and 2024. The first group of astronauts was announced on 3 August 2018.  Artemis program  The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA, U.S. commercial spaceflight companies, and international partners such as ESA, with the goal of landing \\"the first woman and the next man\\" on the Moon, specifically at the lunar south pole region by 2024. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars. In 2017, the lunar campaign was authorized by Space Policy Directive 1, utilizing various ongoing spacecraft programs such as Orion, the Lunar Gateway, Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and adding an undeveloped crewed lander. The Space Launch System will serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch various other elements of the campaign.NASA administrator on new Moon plan: 'We're doing this in a way that's never been done before'.

SpaceX Starship  The SpaceX Starship is planned to be a spacecraft launched as the second stage of a reusable launch vehicle. The concept is under development by SpaceX, as a private spaceflight project. It is being designed to be a long-duration cargo- and passenger-carrying spacecraft. While it will be tested on its own initially, it will be used on orbital launches with an additional booster stage, the Super Heavy, where Starship would serve as the second stage on a two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. The combination of spacecraft and booster is called Starship as well.  Limitations with deep space exploration  The future possibilities for deep space exploration are currently held back by a set of technical, practical, astronomical, and human limitations, which define the future of manned and unmanned space exploration. As of 2017, the farthest any man-made probe has traveled is the current NASA mission Voyager 1, currently about 13 billion miles (21 billion km), or 19.5 light hours away from the Earth, while the nearest star is around 4.24 light years away.  Technical limitations  The current status of space-faring technology, including propulsion systems, navigation, resources and storage all present limitations to the development of human space exploration in the near future. = Distances = The astronomical order of magnitude of the distance between us and the nearest stars is a challenge for the current development of space exploration. At our current top speed of , the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available. It is important to note that this top speed was achieved due to the Oberth effect where the spacecraft was sped up by the Sun's gravity. The fastest escape velocity from the Solar System is that of Voyager 1 at 17 km/s. = Propulsion and fuel = The VASIMR Plasma based propulsion engine In terms of propulsion, the main challenge is the liftoff and initial momentum, since there is no friction in the vacuum of space. Based on the missions goals, including factors such as distance, load and time of flight, the type of propulsion drive used, planned to use, or in design varies from chemical propellants, such as liquid hydrogen and oxidizer (Space Shuttle Main Engine), to plasma or even nanoparticle propellants. Project Longshot Nuclear Fission Engine schematic As for future developments, the theoretical possibilities of nuclear based propulsion have been analyzed over 60 years ago, such as nuclear fusion (Project Daedalus) and nuclear pulse propulsion (Project Longshot), but have since been discontinued from practical research by NASA. On the more speculative side, the theoretical Alcubierre drive presents a mathematical solution for ‚Äúfaster-than-light‚Äù travel, but it would require the mass-Energy of Jupiter, not to mention the technical issues.  Human limitations  The human element in manned space exploration adds certain physiological and psychological issues and limitations to the future possibilities of space exploration, along with storage and sustenance space and mass issues. = Physiological issues = The transitioning gravity magnitudes on the body is detrimental to orientation, coordination, and balance. Without constant gravity, bones suffer disuse osteoporosis, and their mineral density falls 12 times faster than the average elderly adult's. Without regular exercise and nourishment, there can be cardiovascular deterioration and loss in muscle strength. Dehydration can cause kidney stones, and constant hydro-static potential in zero-g can shift body fluids upwards and cause vision problems. Furthermore, without Earth's surrounding magnetic field as a shield, solar radiation has much harsher effects on biological organisms in space. The exposure can include damage to the central nervous system, (altered cognitive function, reducing motor function and incurring possible behavioral changes), as well as the possibility of degenerative tissue diseases. = Psychological issues = The Biosphere 2 greenhouse habitat According to NASA, isolation in space can have detrimental effects on the human psyche. Behavioral issues, such as low morale, mood-swings, depression, and decreasing interpersonal interactions, irregular sleeping rhythms, and fatigue occur independently to the level of training, according to a set of NASA's social experiments. The most famous of which, Biosphere 2, was a 2 year long, 8 person crew experiment in the 1990s, in an attempt to study human necessities and survival in an isolated environment. The result of which were stressed interpersonal interactions and aloof behavior, including limiting and even ceasing contact between crew members, along with failing to sustain a lasting air-recycling system and food supply. = Resources and sustenance = Considering the future possibility of extended, manned missions, food storage and resupply are relevant limitations. From a storage point of view, NASA estimates a 3-year Mars mission would require around of food, most of it in the form of precooked, dehydrated meals of about a portion. Fresh produce would only be available in the beginning of the flight, since there would not be refrigeration systems. Water's relative heavy weight is a limitation, so on the International Space Station (ISS) the use of water per person is limited to a day, compared to the average Americans' . The ISS \\"Veggie plant growth system\\" and Red Romaine Lettuce As for resupply, efforts have been made to recycle, reuse and produce, to make storage more efficient. Water can be produced through chemical reactions of Hydrogen and Oxygen in fuel cells, and attempts and methods of growing vegetables in micro-gravity are being developed and will continue to be researched. Lettuce has already successfully grown in the ISS's \\"Veggie plant growth system\\", and has been consumed by the astronauts, even though large-scale plantation is still impractical, due to factors such as pollination, long growth periods, and lack of efficient planting pillows.  Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Space Craft Development  The idea of using high level automated systems for space missions has become a desirable goal to space agencies all around the world. Such systems are believed to yield benefits such as lower cost, less human oversight, and ability to explore deeper in space which is usually restricted by long communications with human controllers. Autonomy will be a key technology for the future exploration of the Solar System, where robotic spacecraft will often be out of communication with their human controllers.  Autonomous systems  Autonomy is defined by three requirements: # The ability to make and carry out decisions on their own, based on information on what they sensed from the world and their current state. # The ability to interpret the given goal as a list of actions to take. # The ability to fail flexibly, meaning they are able to continuously change their actions based on what is happening within their system and their surrounding. Currently, there are many projects trying to advance space exploration and space craft development using AI. = NASA's autonomous science experiment = NASA began its autonomous science experiment (ASE) on Earth Observing-1 (EO-1), which is NASA's first satellite in the millennium program, Earth-observing series launched on November 21, 2000. The autonomy of these satellites is capable of on-board science analysis, re-planning, robust execution, and model-based diagnostic. Images obtained by the EO-1 are analyzed on-board and down linked when a change or interesting event occurs. The ASE software has successfully provided over 10,000 science images. This experiment was the start of many that NASA devised for AI to impact the future of space exploration. = Artificial Intelligence Flight Adviser = NASA's goal with this project is to develop a system that can aid pilots by giving them real-time expert advice in situations that pilot training does not cover or just aid with a pilot's train of thought during flight. Based on the IBM Watson cognitive computing system, the AI Flight Adviser pulls data from a large database of relevant information like aircraft manuals, accident reports, and close-call reports to give advice to pilots. In the future, NASA wants to implement this technology to create fully autonomous systems, which can then be used for space exploration. In this case, cognitive systems will serve as the basis, and the autonomous system will completely decide on the course of action of the mission, even during unforeseen situations. However, in order for this to happen, there are still many supporting technologies required. In the future, NASA hopes to use this technology not only in flights on earth, but for future space exploration. Essentially, NASA plans to modify this AI flight Advisor for Longer range applications. In addition to what the technology is now, there will be additional cognitive computing systems that can decide on the right set of actions based upon unforeseen problems in space. However, in order for this to be possible, there are still many supporting technologies that need to be enhanced. = Stereo vision for collision avoidance = For this project, NASA's goal is to implement stereo vision for collision avoidance in space systems to work with and support autonomous operations in a flight environment. This technology uses two cameras within its operating system that have the same view, but when put together offer a large range of data that gives a binocular image. Because of its duo-camera system, NASA's research indicate that this technology can detect hazards in rural and wilderness flight environments. Because of this project, NASA has made major contributions toward developing a completely autonomous UAV. Currently, Stereo Vision can construct a stereo vision system, process the vision data, make sure the system works properly, and lastly performs tests figuring out the range of impeding objects and terrain. In the future, NASA hopes this technology can also determine the path to avoid collision. The near-term goal for the technology is to be able to extract information from point clouds and place this information in a historic map data. Using this map, the technology could then be able to extrapolate obstacles and features in the stereo data that are not in the map data. This would aid with the future of space exploration where humans can't see moving, impeding objects that may damage the moving space craft.  Benefits of AI  Autonomous technologies would be able to perform beyond predetermined actions. They would analyze all possible states and events happening around them and come up with a safe response. In addition, such technologies can reduce launch cost and ground involvement. Performance would increase as well. Autonomy would be able to quickly respond upon encountering an unforeseen event, especially in deep space exploration where communication back to Earth would take too long. Space exploration could provide us with the knowledge of our universe as well as incidentally developing inventions and innovations. Traveling to Mars and farther could encourage the development of advances in medicine, health, longevity, transportation, communications that could have applications on Earth.  Robotic spacecraft development  = Energy =  Solar panels  Changes in space craft development will have to account for an increased energy need for future systems. Spacecrafts heading towards the center of the Solar System will include enhanced solar panel technology to make use of the abundant solar energy surrounding them. Future solar panel development is aimed at their working more efficiently while being lighter.  Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators  Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTEG or RTG) are solid-state devices which have no moving parts. They generate heat from the radioactive decay of elements such as plutonium, and have a typical lifespan of more than 30 years. In the future, atomic sources of energy for spacecraft will hopefully be lighter and last longer than they do currently. They could be particularly useful for missions to the Outer Solar System which receives substantially less sunlight, meaning that producing a substantial power output with solar panels would be impractical.

Biography Early life Alony was born and raised on Kibbutz Gvulot, located in the northwestern Negev desert. His parents, Shimon and Shoshana, were among the founders of the kibbutz. His father arrived in Israel at the age of seventeen on the Kastner train. His mother, Shoshana, was born on Moshav Givat Hen, near Ra'anana; her father, Israel, had been a member of the group of vegan pioneers who tried to settle Mount Kinneret and later deserted the area. In 1960, the future of Kibbutz Gvulot was in jeopardy following the departure of most of its members. Along with a few others, Alony's parents stayed; Alony was one of a handful of children who remained on the kibbutz. The years of communal sleeping in the children's house, the constant search for social and academic frameworks in the nearby kibbutzim and loneliness left their mark on him. Architecture and Construction Alony earned his bachelor's degree in architecture and urban planning from the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology, and his master's in urbanism and interdisciplinary studies from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia's Institute for Advanced Architecture (thesis: Nomad Trajectories).

Early life and career Cowe, who was of Scottish descent,. was educated at King's School in Tynemouth and then at Fettes College, Edinburgh, where he studied piano and music theory under Michael Lester-Cribb. In 1968, as lead guitarist, he teamed up with Ray Jackson, Rod Clements and Ray Laidlaw to form Downtown Faction, a blues band. After joining forces with folk singer-songwriter Alan Hull, the band became Lindisfarne. Major hit years (1970‚Äì1973) Signed to Charisma Records in 1970, Lindisfarne made three best-selling albums over the next three years: Nicely Out of Tune, Fog on the Tyne and Dingly Dell. Two major British hit singles were also achieved: Rod Clements' \\"Meet Me on the Corner\\", which reached No.5, and Alan Hull's \\"Lady Eleanor\\", which peaked at No.3. Cowe's compositions on these albums included \\"Uncle Sam\\" on Fog on the Tyne, and \\"Go Back\\" on Dingly Dell. Jack The Lad (1973‚Äì76) Cowe, Clements and Laidlaw left Lindisfarne in 1973 to form Jack The Lad, an outfit with more obvious acoustic and traditional leanings than Lindisfarne. Other members who passed through this band's ranks were Billy Mitchell, Ian Walter Fairbairn and Phil Murray. Cowe appeared on Jack The Lad's first three albums, It's...Jack The Lad, The Old Straight Track and Rough Diamonds', all of which were issued on Charisma and included several compositions and arrangements by Cowe. The final Jack The Lad album, Jackpot, was released on United Artists in 1976. Cowe did not appear on this album, but was credited as co-arranger on two tracks. A CD reissue included his composition \\"See How They Run\\". Second stint in Lindisfarne (1978‚Äì1993) The original line-up of Lindisfarne re-formed in 1978 and scored a British Top 10 hit with \\"Run For Home\\" and a minor Top 75 entry with \\"Juke Box Gypsy\\", both written and sung by Alan Hull. Both were included on the band's reunion album Back and Fourth, which reached No.22. Despite Lindisfarne's continuing popularity as a live act, subsequent albums such as Magic in the Air, The News, Sleepless Nights, Dance Your Life Away, C'mon Everybody, Amigos and Elvis Lives on the Moon, all of which featured Cowe, were less successful. The band did score a No.2 hit in 1990, however, with \\"Fog on the Tyne (Revisited)\\" in collaboration with footballer Paul Gascoigne. Cowe played a variety of instruments on both Lindisfarne's and Jack The Lad's albums, including guitar, piano, keyboards, harmonium, accordion, mandolin, banjo and bouzouki. Later years Cowe left Lindisfarne in 1993 to run a microbrewery in Toronto, Canada. He rejoined some of his former colleagues on stage at Newcastle City Hall in 2005, as part of a tribute to Alan Hull, who had passed away in 1995.

She is most notable for discovering a fragment of conglomerate that helped clarify the history of the Malvern Hills. and assisting her brother John Phillips.  Early life  William Smith Anne Phillips was born in Midford, Somerset, in 1803 to Elizabeth (n√©e Smith) and John Phillips. She had two older siblings, John, who also became a geologist, and Ann; Ann died during infancy. John was born in 1800 in Marden, Kent. In 1801, the family moved to Midford, Somerset, and they are believed to have stayed at a property, Tucking Mill House, owned by Elizabeth's brother, William Smith. He was a geologist known for authoring the first geological map of England and developing the basis for the science of stratigraphy. After Anne's birth in 1803, the family moved to Steeple Aston, Oxfordshire. Anne's younger brother, Jenkin, was born in 1807; the family subsequently moved to Coventry (then in Warwickshire). Although some information has been published through letters from her brother John, much of Anne's upbringing and education remains a mystery. The elder John Phillips died in Coventry in January 1808, and Elizabeth in turn died in July after the family had moved to her hometown of Churchill, Somerset. Following the death of her mother, Anne's maternal uncles took care of the orphans. Daniel Smith looked after Jenkin in the village of Churchill, near Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, while William Smith took John and Anne to Broadfield Farm, which was owned by John Smith.  Relationship with John Phillips  Having been orphaned at a young age, Anne Phillips and her brother John became close. In 1829, for reasons still undiscovered, Anne was residing in the home of Monsieur and Madame Goussaerts in Chateau Koekelberg, in Belgium. John arranged to meet her in Brussels, then later in Paris. During their meeting in Paris, John asked Anne to return to York, where he would supply Anne with employment. In 1829 she was appointed his housekeeper, a position she held for thirty-three years. In September of the same year, she began aiding John in his geological work. Both remained unmarried; he regarded her with great respect and depended on her, including in his work. His scientific friends accepted her because of their close relationship and, most likely, her geographic knowledge. John's letters present evidence for Anne‚Äôs intellectual accomplishments by asking about the details of geologic studies with the use of his drawings and requesting her applied geological assistance. Anne became involved in her brother John's geological work, working primarily as his field assistant starting in 1829. John Phillips worked to further William Smith's ideas on using fossils to prove stratigraphy correct. One of John Phillips greatest contributions was naming the major geological eras (Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic) and the mass extinctions that separated them. John Phillips initially believed that Murchison's accepted view on formation was wrong and his sister helped prove his doubts right. This idea would go on to be seen as Anne's greatest geological achievement. John Phillips success can be attributed to years of hard work but also the support of his sister Anne. The 234 letters written by John to his sister help us understand that Anne was able to provide John plenty of scientific and emotional support for her brother. Much of the contributions made by Anne Phillips was unknown until letters of John Philips, her brother were later transcribed by Nina Morgan, a geologist and science writer. Many of these letters were the keys to uncovering the validation of her contributions in John Phillips work. In a letter from 1838, it was Anne‚Äôs brother who wrote to tell her the important role she played in his work. The Guide to Geology, a book whose official author was no other than John Phillips himself. Though it is strongly suggested by William Smith that Anne was a major contributor of the work presented in the book.  Scientific contributions  The Malvern hills in England Anne's brother, John Phillips Anne Phillips' most notable geological achievement was the discovery of scattered broken pieces conglomerate, now known as Miss Phillips Conglomerate. This type of rock became popular as samples of it soon became collectable items on geological field trips. Sir Roderick Murchison was the primary advocate of the first Malvern theory which was labeled ‚ÄúThe Silurian system‚Äù. This system asserted that first the Silurian sediments were formed, and afterwards were interjected with the hot rock of the Malvern Ridge. He felt that the Malvern ridge was intruded as a hot body after the Silurian sediments were laid down. Miss Phillips Conglomerate supported the position of John Phillips. Phillips believed that the Silurians are not truly changed by the intrusives even though they are in sparing contact with them. The piece of evidence credited to Anne Phillips was the literal conglomerate of rock she found in the Malverns that demonstrated that her brother's theory was in fact the correct one, as it showed the two different types of rock meeting without any sort of overrunning of one into the other. In 1842, Anne, accompanied by her brother and his employer, Sir Henry De la Beche, located a place where conglomerate could be seen in contact with one or more intrusive rocks. This survey proved the idea of how rocks in the Malvern Hills were initially moulded, and how the Silurian Sediments were positioned by an ancient sea that broke down due to the Malvern‚Äôs igneous shores. This was a major geological contribution as it resolved the mystery at the time of the origin of these hills and proved Sir Rodrick Impey Murchison wrong. Sir Rodrick was a British geologist and the husband of Scottish geologist, Charlotte Murchison. He had argued that the igneous rocks were younger than the Silurian sediments which then formed and made their way up. However, Anne discovered an outcrop of conglomerate containing fragments of igneous hills near the Dingle Quarry in Malvern, proving Murchison's theory as incorrect. Malvern hills contain many rocks that have Precambrian (Malvernian) igneous obtrusions that are put together by ‚Äú Sienitic‚Äù rocks. A cross-section of the Malvern Hills can be observed to contain Triassic, and Cambrian sandstones as well as marls located on the eastern side, and Cambrian and Silurian sediments located on the west side. This meant the Malvern hills had formed first. The conglomerate provided an anti-murchisonian theory (a belief that the Malvern Hills were younger than the Silurian Sediments). John gave his sister full credit for the discovery of the conglomerate. The report of the discovery was published in London, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science in October 1842: > \\"My sister, knowing the interest I felt in tracing out the history of the > stratification visible in these trap hills, sought diligently for organic > remains ... In this most unpromising search she was entirely successful, and > collected ... several masses richly charged with organic remains\\" In the article he explains that his sister knew about how much he was interested in finding the history of the hills and how he was looking for organic remains. Phillips was not publicly recognized for any further discoveries, however, in letters penned to her by her brother, she was applauded and thanked for her assistance in his work and for always being successful in every search. In the letters, he also asks for geological help and refers to the work she did for his Guide to Geology, as he goes on to say that it was 'Your Little Book'. In a 1864 review written by Longmans it is noted that John was not yet a professor but was Secretary of the British Association and a member of the Royal Society. Longman states the first edition included problems of mineral composition, rock masses , distribution of life , and formation of igneous rock. Anne and John had a good relationship with William Smith and they always kept in touch. Smith acknowledged Anne‚Äôs work and referred to the contributions she made to her brother‚Äôs book. In one of his letters to Anne he thanked her for the second edition of John‚Äôs book Guide to Geology and wrote that her love for fossils encouraged him to do more searches. Miss Phillips conglomerate have become collector‚Äôs items in present day. It is believed that Anne may have contributed to more geologic research.  Death and legacy  The Malvern HillsOver the course of her life, Anne Phillips acted mainly as John's geological companion. Much of the scientific contribution made by Anne's brother, John Smith, heavily relied on Anne‚Äôs support that she provided him in his personal and professional life. His requests often included having Anne send boxes of fossils to his office in London or colouring detailed maps for his novels. Her contributions assisted John in his geologic endeavours. John is publicly grateful towards his sister as he states in 1838 ‚ÄúWhatever I possess is as much yours as mine, for without you I should not have won it .\\" Towards the end of 1862, Anne Phillips moved to a household that was rented by her brother, where she aided him by sorting and cataloging the fossils and minerals he collected. Her legacy remains in much of John‚Äôs work, specifically the second edition of Guide to Geology which is referred to as her ‚Äúlittle book‚Äù due to her contributions to it. One of Anne‚Äôs most known legacies is her work in Malvern Hills, here the rock became known as Miss. Phillips Conglomerate. Anne died in 1862, where she is buried alongside her brother, John Phillips, in the city of York in her late 50's. The Hope Library at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History holds 234 letters sent between John Phillips and Anne Phillips. As information currently known about Anne was taken from the letters written by her brother John, given that none of her own letters are intact.  Education  Little is known about Anne's formal education. There is a strong suggestion that Anne Philips was very well educated and the education may come from her uncle and her brother. Anne Phillips was introduced to geology through her uncle and brother, starting at an early age. Anne Phillips shadowed her brother, John Phillips, and discovered an important piece of evidence that is now known as ‚ÄúMiss Phillips‚Äô Conglomerate‚Äù.

He served as Chief Executive Officer of Inserm (the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research) from 2001 to 2007 and has been President of the Institut Pasteur since October 2013. On September 25, 2017 he was appointed President of the Global Virus Network (GVN). Professional career Christian Br√©chot is specialized in hepatitis B and C and the mechanisms behind liver cancer. He was appointed director of the Liver Cancer and Molecular Virology Inserm unit (U370) in 1993 and Head of the French National Reference Center for Viral Hepatitis in 1998. In 1997, he became Head of the Hepatology Department at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, a position he has held until 2001. He has also been in charge of the Cell Biology Department at the Necker Faculty of Medicine until 2001. On February 14, 2001, he became CEO of Inserm, taking over from Claude Griscelli. From 2008 to 2013, Christian Br√©chot served as Vice President of Medical and Scientific Affairs at the Institut M√©rieux, an umbrella organization consisting of four companies specializing in the fields of in vitro diagnostics, immunotherapy and food safety/nutrition/health, based in Boston, Lyon and Shanghai. He set up a training and research program for physicians and scientists ‚Äì the M√©rieux Research Grants network ‚Äì, which offers large-scale, flexible funding for innovative research projects. This led him to develop an international network of prestigious researchers and scientists, especially in Asia and South America. He was also involved in training and education activities in developing and emerging countries. He developed several training programs in the fields of medicine and pure science (as part of the \\"√âcole de l'Inserm\\"). He set up the \\"Inserm Avenir\\" grant program to help young scientists develop independent research projects. On March 8, 2013, the Institut Pasteur announced that Christian Br√©chot had been appointed as President for a four- year term beginning on October 1, 2013, replacing Alice Dautry. The Institut Pasteur board announced on 24 January 2017 that Christian Br√©chot will step down after his 4-year stint ends on 30 September 2017. Since his arrival, his goal has been to preserve the excellence of the institute, and to develop its international presence: \\"We have to give ourselves the means to recreate a scientific and attractive environment, in order to attract exceptional researchers and to respond to the new public health challenges\\" (Le Monde). Research The main focus of Christian Br√©chot's research is viral hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV), in particular their link with liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC), as well as the molecular mechanisms underpinning liver regeneration and cancer (especially the deregulation of the cell cycle). His work combines academic and clinical approaches in molecular virology and cell biology. His research has focused on the impact of HBV DNA integration and the interactions between HCV proteins and the main cell signaling pathways, such as the interferon and TGF-beta pathways, contributing to improve the understanding of the mechanisms behind liver cancer in patients suffering from chronic HBV or HCV infection. Christian Br√©chot‚Äôs team of researchers has also shed light on several aspects related to cell cycle regulation, in particular through the identification of human cyclin A at the genomic insertion site of HBV in an HCC. Christian Br√©chot directed several projects that led to the development of an innovative diagnostic test for the detection and quantification of HBV DNA in serum. His team also used laser microdissection on liver sections to detect HCV RNA, analyze HCV quasispecies and carry out liver proteomic analysis. Christian Br√©chot has investigated the clinical impact of the genetic variability of HCV, his clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of interferon-ribavirin combination therapy in treating HCV infections. He set up a unit in 2005 (directed by Professor Didier Samuel) at the Centre h√©pato-biliaire (CHB) in Villejuif in the Paris suburbs, one of the main European liver transplant centers. This group explored the potential of the HIP/PAP molecule, which has mitogenic and anti- apoptotic properties in liver cells, and demonstrated that HIP/PAP has a highly original mechanism of action: its intrinsic ROS and antioxidant pathway blocking properties are particularly directed at the extracellular matrix. The scientists also demonstrated the potential of gene therapy based on the use of NIS dnaC to transduce liver cancer cells, and the use of iodide (131I) to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. Prizes and awards Christian Br√©chot is a member of several specialized French and international medical associations. He has received awards, including the Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine prize in 1996 and the Jean-Valade award in 2000. He was also a junior member of the Institut universitaire de France in 1991 for a five-year period. Articles #Brechot, C., Pourcel, C., Louise, A., Rain B., and Tiollais P.

His works are usually large-scale, energetic, and colourful works on unstretched canvas. Trusttum was born in Raetihi, in the central North Island, in 1940 to William and Katherine Trusttum. His father was a Methodist lay preacher, but he became disillusioned with his religious work and in 1945 the Trusttum family left for Christchurch, where Philip attended Waimairi School. The family moved to Oxford in 1948, and again to Rangiora in 1955 and to nearby Ashley in 1957. Philip Trusttum's interest in art was kindled in Oxford, but did not seriously study the subject until he was 20, at which time he was accepted into the University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts. Here, he was taught by Rudolf Gopas, who was to prove a strong influence on the young artist, and through him became interested in expressionism. He was also to become a member of The Group an influential group of Canterbury artists whose members included Colin McCahon, Toss Woollaston, and Doris Lusk. Trusttum graduated with a Diploma in Fine Arts in 1965. In 1967, Trusttum was awarded a Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council scholarship for travel to develop his practice, though his initial overseas trip, to Australia, was met with disaster when many of his finished canvases were damaged in transit. Since then his travels have taken him to both North America and Europe. Since the early 1970s Trusttum's work has largely been inspired by everyday life experiences often worked into a semi-abstract form. His subject matter has ranged from house renovation to tennis, horses to Japanese masks. In 1984, Trusttum participated in ANZART at the Edinburgh Arts Festival. He has shown in Sydney, New York, and Melbourne, as well as in all New Zealand's main centres. In 2000 he became only the second New Zealand artist to be awarded the prestigious Pollock Krasner Foundation grant.

The events of the war are recorded by the historian Polybius.Polybius, The Histories, IV 53-55. It is considered \\"the greatest war in Cretan history\\" during Antiquity. Prelude The prelude to the conflict in Crete was the commercial war between the cities of Rhodes and Byzantium about the toll introduced by the Byzantines for all ships passing through the Bosporus on their way to the Pontus Euxinus. Posing a huge threat to Hellenistic trade, the conflict was ended in 220 BC with a compromise.Polybius, IV 43-52. Outbreak Meanwhile in Crete the allied cities of Cnossus and Gortys had gained control of the whole island, except for the Spartan colony of Lyttos which alone resisted. When the Rhodian navarch Polemocles returned from the war against Byzantium, the Cnossians thought that he could be helpful to their efforts against Lyttos. So they asked the Rhodians for assistance and Polemocles arrived with three decked and three undecked ships. Soon after his arrival, however, the people of Eleutherna accused him of assassinating a citizen, Timarchus, and, in response, they declared war on the Rhodians. Meanwhile the Cnossians and their allies had moved against Lyttos, but then, for some unknown reason, the alliance broke up and the Cretans began to quarrel with each other. Thus the cities of Polyrrhenia and Lappa, along with some other communities, defected from the Cnossians and allied with the Lyttians.Polybius, IV 53. Civil War In Gortys the citizens were divided on the question of alliance and a civil war broke out in the city. The elder Gortynians remained loyal to Cnossus, while the younger Gortynians favoured the Lyttians.Polybius, IV 53, 7.  Aetolian Intervention Taken by surprise by the sudden reverse, the Cnossians asked the Aetolian League for help. The Aetolians were already present in Cydonia and sent 1000 warriors as assistance. After the arrival of the Aetolians, the elders in Gortys led the Cnossians and the Aetolians to occupy their citadel and proceeded to kill or expel their younger opponents. The young Gortynians took refuge in the ancient castle of Phaistos overlooking the bay south to Mount Ida. Later the young Gortynians in Phaistos launched a bold attack against the port of Gortys which they occupied, and they then besieged their opponents in the citadel of Gortys.Polybius, IV 53, 8-10 and 55, 6. Destruction of Lyttos While the Cnossians were occupied at Gortys, most of the Lyttian warriors left their city to invade the enemy territory. The Cnossians, however, got intelligence of their plan and took the opportunity to invade the undefended city of Lyttos, capturing all the women and children and razing the city to the ground. When the Lyttians returned from their expedition, they decided to abandon their devastated homes and settled in Lappa whose citizens were willing to host them.Polybius, IV 54. Achaean Intervention Meanwhile, tensions on the mainland had risen between the Achaean League and the Aetolian League. As a result, in 220 BC the Social War broke out, which was to involved the Macedonian king Philip V as he was a key ally of the Achaeans. The Polyrrhenians then used the Aetolian interference in Crete as justification for asking Philip and the Achaeans for assistance against their common enemy. The Achaeans and Macedonians accepted them as allies and sent a mercenary force led by Plator to the island, consisting of 400 Illyrians, 200 Achaeans and 100 Phocians.Polybius, IV 55, 1-2. With these reinforcements, the Polyrrhenians made great progress moving against Eleutherna, Cydonia and Aptera. They quickly forced these cities to abandon their Cnossian allies and enter the opposition coalition.Polybius, IV 55, 3-4. Thus the Cnossians, in a short time, not only lost most of their allies, but also their hegemony over the island. Nevertheless they were still able to assist the Aetolian allies with 1000 archers in their war on the Greek mainland. The Polyrrhenians on the opposite side did the same by sending 500 Cretans to support Philip V.Polybius, IV 55, 5. Outcome The war continued for several years, but the further narration by Polybius is lost. Generally, the war went favourably for the enemies of Cnossus. Thus the Aetolians were expelled from the island and by 216 BC Crete was more or less a Macedonian protectorate.Teocharis Detorakis, History of Crete, p. 74. Two years later the Achaean strategos Aratus of Sicyon confirmed this outcome claiming that Philip V of Macedon enjoyed the faith of the Cretans and his ships ruled the Cretan Sea, while most of the island's strongholds obeyed his command.Plutarch, Aratus, 50. Among the mercenary leaders fighting on the island was a young Arcadian named Philopoemen, who acquired great fame and experience which would serve him well in his later years as strategos of the Achaean League.Plutarch, Philopoemen, 7. As a side effect of the conflict, Cretan mercenaries (the famed archers and the so-called Neocretans) are recorded all over the Hellenistic world, although none of the leaders (Cnopias of Allaria, Philon the Cnossian, Eurylochus of Crete, Zelys the Gortynian at Raphia 217 BC; Lagoras, Kambylos and Bolis at the siege of Sardis 215/13 BC) can be traced directly to the civil war. The Lyttians eventually returned to their homes and rebuilt their city on a nearby hill.Florence Gaignerot-Driessen, The 'killing' of a city, p. 285-297. The conflict over Crete was renewed in 205 BC, when Philip V of Macedon used the island as a base for naval raids against the Rhodians. In the Cretan War (205‚Äì200 BC), Philip's major allies in Crete were the cities of Hierapytna and Olous. Toward the end, when the Romans entered the coalition against Macedon, the Cnossians sided again with the Rhodians and forced Hierapytna to surrender. As a result, the Rhodians took control over eastern Crete which allowed them to largely stamp out piracy in the area. Following the Second Macedonian War, in 197 BC, Philip V lost all former allies and all possessions outside Macedonia proper.

Its first issue was published November 23, 1844. It is the largest newspaper in the Bahamas. History After the liberal Sir James Carmichael-Smyth became governor in 1829, dissent rose in Nassau over the question of emancipation and in 1831 a pro-slavery section of the community supported George Biggs in the establishment of The Argus in order to promote their anti-emancipation views. In 1837, Edwin Charles Moseley, a journalist who had worked at The Times in London, arrived in Nassau to take up his appointment as editor of The Argus. Moseley found the semi-weekly's policies so objectionable that he refused to become its editor. On 23 November 1844, Moseley founded the Nassau Guardian. Recognizing that the newspaper industry in the Bahamas could not withstand three newspapers, Moseley acquired the Bahama Herald in 1877. Alfred Edwin Moseley acquired the Nassau Guardian from his father, Edwin. In 1904, Alfred died and Mary Moseley became the editor and manager of the newspaper. In 1907, Mary acquired the newspaper from the Estate of the late Percival James Moseley. Mary would own and run the newspaper for 48 more years to a restricted audience with circulation seldom exceeding 300 daily. Before WWII, she had hoped to give the newspaper to her nephew, Doyle Moseley, who lived in Australia at the time. Doyle would enlist in The Royal Air Force during the war and while in a raid over France in the early 1940s had been killed. Since no one in the family was interested in the family business, she turned control and the newspaper to a group of Nassau business and professional men who offered to buy The Nassau Guardian from her. Mary worked in an advisory capacity from 1952‚Äì55. Mary died on January 19, 1961, at the age of 81. The new owners tried to turn it into a propaganda medium to promote their political philosophies, however, that was not success. In 1967, John S. Perry Jr. acquired the newspaper. On January 20, 2002, The Nassau Guardian became a fully Bahamian‚Äìowned newspaper when John H. Perry, son of John Jr., sold his 60 percent stake in the company.

A quickshifter (or quick shifter) is a device that allows clutchless shifting on a manual transmission, and is commonly found on motorcycles. It can increase the safety and comfort of the vehicle since it eliminates the need to use the clutch or throttle before and after a gearshift. Since they eliminate the need to use the clutch and throttle during a gearshift, they are quicker than shifting normally (usually shifting in less than 50 milliseconds) and as such are a popular performance enhancement on motorcycles.  Working mechanism  Almost all quickshifters work on the same basis, a sensor detects the gear shift action, a microcontroller (CPU) processes the data (and calculates the timing) and cuts off ignition momentarily, resulting in reduction of load at the transmission allowing the new gear to slip (and engage) into its place. However the method of sensing and reducing the load can vary.  Sensor  Most gearshift sensors work by measuring the pressure change (push or pull) on the shift rod. However, some sensors measure the molecular strain in the shift rod to determine the gearshift process instead of using a pressure switch. The use of molecular strain gauge (sensor) is costly but more reliable (than push/pull sensor) and free from false readings due to vibrations since it has no moving parts.  Microcontroller  The microcontrollers generally control the ignition and/or fuel supply to reduce the load from the transmission when needed. They can be either separate from ECU or a single unit (ECU performing quick-shifting). They can provide near-perfect gearshift in tens of milliseconds.  Load reduction  The load from the transmission is generally reduced by cutting off the ignition and/or fuel supply in the engine, or by disengaging the clutch. Since load is reduced from transmission precisely (if tuned correctly) by the microcontroller, it does less damage to use the quickshifter than clutchless gearshift without a quickshifter on a manual transmission. This process is also called unloading.  Bi-directional quickshifter  The term bi-directional quickshifter means that the quickshifter works on both directions of gearshift - upshifts and downshifts. Most quickshifters are bi-directional, so the term quickshifter is usually alone sufficient. However, exceptions are present such as 2016 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R and 2015 H2/R's \\"KQS\\" quickshifters which are \\"mono-directional\\" and only work on upshifts. Their primary aim is usually to achieve better acceleration by reducing the time interval between gearshifts during acceleration which results in continuous and smoother power delivery to the wheels. Examples of performance oriented motorcycles using bi-directional quickshifter are BMW S1000RR and S1000R, 2017 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R and H2/R, Suzuki GSX-R1000/R, Aprilia Tuono, KTM Duke 390 etc.  References   See also  Motorcycle transmission Electronic aids: * Traction control system (TCS) * Anti-lock braking system (ABS) * Launch control * Electronic Stability Control (ESC) * Cruise control Motorcycle transmissions ","title":"Quickshifter"},{"id":"55352481","text":"Conophytum hammeri is a small, endangered, South African species of succulent plant, of the genus Conophytum.

The convent was home to nuns of the Poor Clares order from 1850 to 2011. The convent is based around a 17th- century house that was enlarged in the 1850s. The dedicated convent buildings were built between 1861 and 1869 by Charles Hansom. A separate guest house was built around 1870 by Canon Scoles. The convent is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England. The convent originally belonged to a Franciscan order before its adoption by the Poor Clares. Five sisters of the Poor Clares order remained at the convent's dissolution; they subsequently moved to a Poor Clares convent in Lynton, North Devon. Poor Clares exiled from France in 1904 joined Franciscan nuns at Woodchester. The convent at Woodchester was built in the 1860s; at its zenith, the convent housed 30 nuns after the Second World War, but it had declined to 12 mostly elderly nuns by 1998. Duff Hart-Davis visited the convent for a 1998 article in The Independent on Sunday and met the Mother Abbess, Sister Mary Anthony, and a Sister Mary Therese. Hart-Davis reported that the nuns' primary source of income was the production of altar breads, of which they made five million a year, earning them ¬£25,000. The nuns also had a vegetable garden and an orchard and kept bees, cows, and chickens. Hart-Davis also wrote about the nuns' Christmas celebrations and reported that they did not have a television, but borrowed one for Christmas and Easter. The Poor Clares donated their library from the Woodchester convent to Durham University Library. Durham's holdings comprise 485 titles from the Woodchester Convent, dating from the 16th to the 19th century, with the majority of books from the Poor Clares convent in Princehof near Bruges. The books are mostly devotional in nature.

It was acquired by the collector William Henry Blackmore and later entered the collection of George Rae, one of Rossetti's patrons. It later passed from Rae to the joint ownership of Arthur Du Cros and Otto Beit and it was purchased from them by the Tate Gallery in 1916 via the NACF ‚Äì it is now in the collection of Tate Britain in London.Tate Britain ‚Äì Monna Vanna It shows a frontal half-length portrait of Rossetti's main model Alexa Wilding, with her head turned to the right of the frame. She is shown with pale, luminous and delicate skin (fitting in with the aestheticism of the timeMonna Vanna) and a hard penetrating gaze. She holds a feather fan over her right shoulder as well wearing many kinds of jewellery, picked by the painter to show off his painterly skill ‚Äì a red coral necklace, rings and earrings. In her hair are two spiral shell-shaped hairclips, accessories particularly loved by Rossetti and used here to emphasize the painting's circular composition. Rossetti's own opinion of the painting was that it was \\"probably the most effective as a room decoration that I have ever painted\\". Title Its original title was Venus Veneta (Venetian Venus), making it a response to Renaissance and classical archetypes, particular those by Titian and other 16th century painters ‚Äì in a letter dated 27 September 1866, Rossetti stated his aim in painting it was to produce \\"a Venetian lady in a rich dress of white and gold ‚Äì in short the Venetian ideal of female beauty\\". After its completion he renamed it Monna Vanna (vain woman) to underline the vanity of life or more likely to emphasize the subject's Italian origins. The new title derived from Monna Vanna (\\"Vain Woman\\"), a character in chapter XXIV of one of Rossetti's favourite books, La Vita Nuova by his namesake Dante Alighieri. The woman in question may refer to Giovanna, the beloved of the poet Guido Cavalcanti, who is heavily associated with images of springtime in Dante's work. The painter had translated the Vita into English in 1848 and it had intense personal significance to him, principally in its allusions to spring, referenced in this painting by the vase of flowers in the top right hand corner and the floral motifs on the woman's gold brocade robe. In 1873 Rossetti renamed it again, this time as Belcolore, since he now felt the other titles did not fully indicate the modernity of the subject, but this did not last and Monna Vanna is still the accepted title.

He specialized in the study of fossilized sea urchins, contributing meticulous descriptions of many fossils found in southern France, Algeria, Tunisia and Persia. Life Victor-Auguste Gauthier was born in Tonnerre, Yonne, on 5 March 1837, son of a small winemaker. At an early age he was attracted to paleontology. He graduated from the College of Tonnerre, then was a ma√Ætre r√©p√©titeur at the lyc√©es of Sens and Orl√©ans. He obtained a degree in Letters, then passed the agr√©gation in Grammar. He taught in turn at lyc√©es in Pau, Le Puy, Moulins and finally, on 7 January 1864, at Marseille. During the nineteen years he spent in Marseille he devoted himself to the study of the Echinidae, a family of sea urchins, and made an important collection of the species of Provence. On 7 August 1883 Gauthier was named professor at the Lyc√©e Michelet in Vanves and was soon promoted to the rank of officer of public instruction. Victor Gauthier died on died on 20 February 1911 in Sens at the age of 73. Work thumb Gauthier's first works were collaborations. He described two newly discovered species in the Essai de G√©ologie et de Pal√©ontologie Aveyronnaise by Pierre Reyn√®s (1829‚Äì77), and then with Alphonse P√©ron (1834‚Äì1908) he engaged in the Description des Echinides fossiles de l'Alg√©rie under the direction of Gustave Cotteau. This was a significant work, of which the first two chapters were published in the Annales des Sciences g√©ologiques (1873) and in the Biblioth√®que des Hautes √©tudes (1875). They were subsequently revised in 1883‚Äì84 to form part of the first volume of this great work. From 1873 to 1891 Gauthier worked constantly on the descriptions of the Algerian fossil Echinidae, for which Peron provided most of the materials, wrote the stratigraphic notes and collaborated with Gauthier on some of the descriptions. Cotteau retained overall responsibility and his opinion prevailed in questions of interpretations of genera and species and in general classification. Gauthier generally avoided expressing opinions but gave very complete, detailed and precise descriptions on the species he studied, followed by a careful examination of similarities and differences of form with neighboring species. As publication of the work on Algerian fossile progressed Gauthier gained a deeper knowledge. He ventured to write a few short notes, the first on Echinidae near Marseilles, another on the Echinidae of the department of the Bouches-du-Rhone. From 1888 to 1895 Gauthier published a series of articles in the Annuaire g√©ologique universel in which he analyzed the main works published at that time on Echinoderms. In 1889 Gauthier published the important Echinides fossiles de la Tunisie. In 1893 Philippe Thomas published the palaeontology results of the Tunisian Scientific Exploration Mission (1885‚Äì86) in six instalments plus an atlas, giving the work of Victor-Auguste Gauthier (sea urchins), Arnould Locard (Mollusca), Auguste P√©ron (Brachiopods, Bryozoa and Pentacrinitess) and Henri √âmile Sauvage (fish). First in collaboration with Cotteau in 1895, then alone in 1902, Gauthier described the curious Echinidae brought back from Persia by Jacques de Morgan. From 1898 to 1905 Gauthier published several Contributions √† l'√©tude des Echinides fossiles in the Bulletin du Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France. In collaboration with the engineer Ren√© Fourtau, in 1899 Gauthier published the R√©vision des Echinides fossiles de l'Egypte. This was soon followed by two notes on Egyptian fossils, and led to him being appointed a member of the Institut √©gyptien.

As of 2019, he is CEO of IDA Ireland, the Irish State agency responsible for attracting inward foreign direct investment to Ireland, a role he has held since 2014. Early life Shanahan was born in Abbeydorney, County Kerry. He holds a H.Dip (Higher Diploma in Hotel and Catering Management), and an M.Sc., from Dublin Institute of Technology, as well as a B.Sc. (Mgmt.) and M.A. (1994) from Trinity College Dublin, and an M.Res (Master of Educational Research) from Lancaster University. Career Early career Shanahan's early experience was in the hotel industry and Irish public sector roles including F√°ilte Ireland, the Irish tourism promotion and development authority, and CERT (a State tourism training body). According to his resume, Shanahan worked in some private Irish hotels (e.g. Sinnott Hotels). Shanahan worked from 2005 to 2014 in Forf√°s, an Irish state-funded policy agency which advised government on enterprise, trade, science, technology, and innovation, with a staff of 90. Shanahan worked in a number of Forf√°s roles before becoming head of the policy unit in 2010. Forfas was dissolved in 2014, as part of the then Government's commitment to reducing the number of Irish State quangos, and its functions were transferred to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland, the Industrial Development Authority and the Health and Safety Authority. IDA Ireland Shanahan took up the position of CEO of IDA Ireland on 1 September 2014. The role was described by journalist Colm Kelpie as \\"part politician, part diplomat, and part salesman\\". Shanahan has highlighted Ireland's talent, and the quality of third-level education system in particular, as the reason why Ireland has been so popular with multinational companies. =Brexit= The first major event to occur during Shanahan's tenure as IDA CEO was Brexit. Shanahan was quoted as saying Brexit was likely to be a net positive for IDA Ireland in terms of attracting companies (both UK and non-UK) to Ireland as a base for selling into the EU. In June 2017 Shanahan was criticized for filling only one of ten positions that his office had been given to hire people to attract companies to Ireland that were leaving the UK due to Brexit. In October 2017 and again in January 2018 Shanahan testified before the Public Accounts Committee that Ireland needed to improve the affordability of its housing and its infrastructure, particularly broadband internet access, to remain competitive in attracting foreign companies; he also said that while companies in the financial industry were considering moving from the UK to Ireland due to Brexit, the loss of access to the UK for companies that depend on it for sales or supplies could harm Irish companies. As of December 2017 several major financial firms based in the UK had chosen to go to Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Brussels, or Paris, and in January 2018 Shanahan reported that no new jobs had been created in Ireland due to Brexit and that he expected to see the outcome of his office's efforts at the end of 2018 or the beginning of 2019. By June 2018 companies opting to go elsewhere had caused Ireland to fall out of the top 10 rankings for European financial firms. =US corporate tax changes= The second major event was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (or TCJA) which changes the tax structure for U.S. multinationals in Ireland. Shanahan was initially relaxed about the TCJA noting Ireland's \\"headline\\" corporate tax rate of 12.5% was competitive against the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. =Other items= In November 2014, Shanahan was interviewed on CNBC's Squawk Box live in the CNBC studio. During the interview, long-standing CNBC presenter Joe Kernen asked unusual questions including: \\"Do tax breaks lead to better golfers?\\" \\"Is Ireland really in the euro?\\" \\"Is it not just part of Britain?\\" and \\"Is it actually its own island?\\". The unusual interview received international coverage American TV host surprised to learn Ireland has the euro not the pound, The Guardian; 3 November 2014 CNBC presenter quizzes IDA Ireland boss...doesn't realise Ireland isn't part of the UK and no longer uses the pound, Independent; 4 November 2014Hilariously embarrassing video of CNBC co-anchor bemused by Ireland's use of the euro, The Telegraph; 4 November 2014Irish Agog That Joe Kernen, CNBC Host, Missed Their Exit From U.K., The New York Times; 4 November 2014This American TV Host Has Absolutely No Idea Ireland Uses The Euro, BuzzFeed News; 4 November 2014 During the Irish Same- sex marriage referendum in 2015, Shanahan stated that a 'Yes' vote would be in the State's economic interest and that a 'No' vote would send a negative message to the international business community (Ireland's largest company is Apple). His interview drew praise and criticism with some questioning if he had over-stepped his position, as Shanahan himself is gay. =Wikipedia Scandal= In April 2019, Shanahan was involved in a scandal relating to the editing of Wikipedia pages by paid editors following allegations by Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrave . Various pages were alleged including those relating to Shanahan, the Irish economy and taxation system and others. Many of these pages has been established or mainly contributed to by a Wikipedia user named Britishfinance. Personal life As of last report, Shanahan lives in Skerries, in Fingal, north of Dublin, with his partner, Gary. He is a prominent member of the LGBT community and LGBT in business.

She is a guitarist, keyboard player and singer who has released 3 albums and 1 EP with another EP set for 2018.  Career   Early life and recordings  Sydney Wayser was born in Los Angeles, but spent summers in Paris with her French musician-filmmaker father, Jacques Wayser. She graduated from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts then divided her time between New York, New York and Los Angeles, California making her own music that was influenced by Jeff Buckley, Serge Gainsbourg, Rufus Wainwright, Loudon Wainwright III and Leonard Cohen, as well as women like Feist and Beyonce. When Wayser released her debut album, Silent Parade in 2008, NPR cited \\"her unabashed love for gloomy orchestrations and waltz rhythms. There‚Äôs the tinkling glockenspiel, a lone oboe, accordion and creaking string arrangements, with Wayser‚Äôs piano work steering the ship. It‚Äôs an appropriate backdrop for her brooding meditations on misery and heartache, all set in a world inhabited by lurking strangers and ghosts of the past.\\" In 2009, Wayser‚Äôs album The Colorful was released, and three years later came Bell Choir Coast. The latter album was produced by Dan Molad from Lucius and mixed by Shawn Everett. From that album, the song \\"Dream It Up\\" was used as the soundtrack for Billabong‚Äôs 2012 Summer Swim video. After Hurricane Sandy hit New York in October 2012, Wayser‚Äôs Brooklyn apartment was flooded. As a result, she moved back to Los Angeles where she created a new recording and performing persona called Clara-Nova which the LA Weekly noted \\"represents the evolution of Wayser, lyrically and musically. She's ditching the acoustic guitar for a standing keyboard and tambourine backed by a full band.\\" As Clara-Nova, Wayser debuted live in January 2014 at the Sundance Film Festival, and that March appeared on NBC‚Äôs Last Call with Carson Daly to support Bell Choir Coast. On 2014, her work earned Clara-Nova the ASCAP Abe Olman Scholarship and that same year she was signed to a major label only to see that deal end with the label taking her masters. As a result, Wayser began rerecording that music. Clara-Nova performed at the 2016 edition of SXSW. Wayser spent 2017 singing backup for Lorde as well as working with producer Shawn Everett (Weezer, Alabama Shakes, John Legend, Lucius) on a new Clara- Nova EP called The Iron Age set for release on March 2, 2018 on Kobalt Music Recordings. \\"The Illusionist\\" single from the EP was released September 29, 2017.  Trailer music  As Clara-Nova, Wayser's version of the Simple Minds' ballad \\"Belfast Child\\" was used in the trailer for Ridley Scott's biblical film \\"Exodus: Gods and Kings\\" in 2014. A year later, \\"Dear God\\", an XTC song covered by the band Lawless featuring Wayser on vocals was featured in a trailer for the Academy Award-winning film Spotlight. That same song version provided the music for Outlanders season 2 trailer in 2016. The trailer for 2017‚Äôs Netflix film, Icarus, featured Wayser‚Äôs cover of the Cake song, \\"Going the Distance\\"  Song placements in TV shows  During her career span, Wayser has had her songs featured in a number of television shows highlighting scenes.

The next day, they drop a cow into the well to hide Arlette's body and provide a reason for filling in the well. Sheriff Jones (Brian d'Arcy James) is suspicious following her sudden disappearance; he searches the house, but finds no proof of a crime, tentatively believing Wilf's story that his wife absconded. As time passes Henry becomes brooding and isolated, regretting the crime that he and his father have committed. His girlfriend Shannon grows increasingly concerned and is subsequently discovered to be pregnant with their child. Her parents decide to send her to a Catholic institution in Omaha until the baby is born and can be given up for adoption. Henry steals Wilf's car, arrives in Omaha and runs away with Shannon. As the winter passes, Wilf appears to be going insane, being constantly harassed by rats. He takes out a mortgage on his house to fix it up, but never actually does the work. The roofs on his barn and his house cave in, but he is too consumed by guilt and alcohol to fix them. His house falls in to a state of total disrepair and becomes completely infested by rats. One rat bites his hand, which becomes infected and must be amputated. In a climactic scene, Wilf is confronted by the ghost of his wife, surrounded by the rats which ate her corpse. She corners him in the basement and sadistically whispers to him. She recounts, as the viewer sees, the fate of Henry and Shannon. They became robbers, known as the \\"Sweetheart Bandits\\". During one of their heists, Shannon is shot, causing her to lose the baby and ultimately die from massive blood loss in an abandoned house they found by the side of the road. Henry lies down next to her and commits suicide with a handgun. Later, an unidentified woman's body is found on the side of the road which the sheriff assumes is Arlette. Henry's body is delivered to Wilf, which, like his mother's body, has been chewed through by rats. No one attends Henry's funeral except for Wilf. He turns, and again sees the ghost of his wife, surrounded by rats. Wilf attempts to sell his land to Shannon's father (Neal McDonough), who bluntly tells Wilf to leave his property and never come back. Ending up selling the land to the livestock company at a low price, Wilf moves to Omaha and finds a job hauling pallets, but cannot escape being followed by rats. Eight years later, in 1930, Wilf writes his confession, concluding \\"In the end, we all get caught.\\" By the time he finishes, dozens of rats have swarmed his room. Arlette, Henry, and Shannon's corpses have appeared in front of the frightened Wilf. Brandishing the same butcher's knife used to kill his mother, Henry tells Wilf that his death will be quick.

John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter stated \\"[the] film is not lurid in its scares, and instead depicts its protagonist's suffering mostly as a slow rot.\\" Critics appreciated Thomas Jane's portrayal of Wilfred James. \\"The bulk of the movie's appeal, however, comes from Thomas Jane, delivering his most effective performance in ages. He plays tortured would-be lunatic Wilfred James, who lords over 80 acres of Nebraska farmland that his family has owned for generations. Within five minutes, a disheveled Wilfred establishes in voiceover that he's confessing a crime, and by 10 minutes, it's clear what he's done.\\" said Eric Kohn on Indiewire.

The book centers around Idu, a young woman in a Nigerian village whose husband has died, and her efforts to be reunited with him. The novel has been seen as one of Nwapa's more controversial works for its focus on Idu's reliance on her husband.  Plot  The novel is set in a remote African village and follows the protagonist Idu and her husband Adiewere over a number of years. From the beginning of the novel, Nwapa ensures the reader is aware of the wedded bliss between Idu and Adiewere; they are absolutely devoted to each other as husband and wife. Their happiness together is portrayed to be overwhelming. In the African tribe, motherhood is coveted and being a mother is deemed to be far more important than being a devoted wife. Despite their desire for children, Idu and Adiewere remain childless for many years. During this time, Idu and Adiewere build a great business and become prosperous however when Adiewere's brother, Ishiodu is in trouble, they forfeit their wealth to help Ishiodu. As time passes, the pressure from the villagers for Idu and Adiewere to have a child becomes unbearable and Idu weeps that she has brought the curse of childlessness onto her husband. At Idu's beckoning, Adiewere takes a second wife, who he treats as a child rather than a wife. Idu unexpectedly announces she is pregnant and the village rejoices with the couple and bestows many gifts upon the popular couple. Upon becoming aware of Idu's pregnancy, the second wife leaves Adiewere. Idu's son is born on the day of an eclipse which Idu believes is a bad omen, remembering a dream about having a boy that was so dark she did not dare touch the boy. Idu and Adiewere name their son Ijoma. Idu's sister Anamadi grows to love Ijoma and he spends most of his time with her. Two years pass and Idu is not again pregnant and thus Idu asks her husband to take another wife rather than constantly being berated as being ‚Äòbad‚Äô for denying her husband the privilege of more children. The reader is then introduced to a second couple, Ojiugo and Amarajeme who also adore each other. Ojiugo is Idu's childhood friend. However, after six years and no children, Ojiugo leaves Amarajeme to live with her husband's friend in order to fulfill her dream of motherhood. Amarajeme is heartbroken and wears black and mourns his wife. Upon hearing the news Ojiugo has born a son, Amarajeme realises he is sterile and to blame for their childlessness and hangs himself. Ojiugo hears of Amarajeme's death and dies that same day from heartbreak for her first beloved husband. After four years, Idu becomes pregnant for a second time and for a short time, the couple and the village rejoice in the pending birth of their second child. Tragically, Adiewere dies suddenly. After Adiewere's death, Idu does not weep, wear black or scrape her hair as tradition expects. Further, Idu refuses to marry Ishiodu, her husband's brother; Idu is steadfast that she will join Adiewere. Ultimately, Idu rejects life and dies in order to be with her beloved husband.  Major characters  *Idu: Idu is a devoted wife who often has ideals which are a departure from tradition. Idu loves her husband Adiewere so intensely, she is willing to concede to traditions in order to not shame her husband. *Adiewere: Adiewere is the husband of Idu. He is a doting and devoted husband who, like his wife, is willing to sacrifice his personal ideals to concede to his wife's wishes. *Ogbenyanu: Ogbenyau is a sister of Idu who bears a child before Idu causing Idu great grief. *Anamadi: Anamadi is the sister of Idu who comes to love her nephew Ijoma and cares for Ijoma most of the time. Anamadi is the person who finds Idu dead. *Okeke: Okeke is a business friend of Idu. Okeke showers Idu with gifts when she becomes pregnant. *Ishiodu: Ishiodu is the only brother of Adiewere. Idu and Adiewere provide funds to clear Ishiodu's debt. After Adiewere dies, the village pressures Idu to marry Ishiodu. *Ijoma: Ijoma is the male child of Idu and Adiewere. Ijoma is born on the day of an eclipse, considered an omen because of the ‚Äútwo nights‚Äù. *Ojiugo: Ojiugo is Idu's childhood friend. Ojiugo is married to Amarajeme and together they are unable to bear children and Ojiugo eventually marries Obukodi to fulfill her dreams of motherhood. *Amarajeme: Amarajeme is Ojiugo's first husband and they are desperately in love however Amarajeme is sterile and Ojiugo ultimately leaves him. Upon hearing Ojiugo has born a son, Amarajeme commits suicide. Because he is not ready to hear this kind of news. *Obukodi: Obukodi is the person whom Ojiugo leaves her beloved husband Amarajeme in order to bear a child.  Culture  The culture showcased in Idu is that of the Igbo people. The book is both representative and unrepresentative of the Igbo culture. Some criticism includes: * Idu challenges an Igbo woman's cultural norms by rejecting the idea of male dominance, their role as a wife, and the importance of the child. * Idu's death acts as a protest against the Igbo traditional custom, levirate. * Nwapa showcases the ideal Igbo woman within her character, Idu, rather than the average Igbo woman. * The characters in Idu are at odds with the Igbo reality. Aspects that are representative of Igbo culture includes: * The concept that a childless marriage is a failure. * In ‚ÄúThe Igbo Word‚Äù, the Chimalum Nwankwo states that one of Idu's core themes is childlessness and the unhappiness it brings. * Nwapa's use of the Uhamiri. The Uhamiri is an Igbo myth. This myth acts as a plot device in Idu. * The myth of Uhamiri allows for increased cultural awareness of the Igbo culture. Uhamiri is a symbol of morality and ethical values in the Igbo culture.  Themes  A central theme in Idu, is the tension between traditional customs and divergence from established traditions. Tradition holds that it is women's singular duty to aspire to have children. Tradition holds that the glory of motherhood is far more important than the glory of being a wife. However, this tradition is tested by Idu and Adiewere at times; the couple also accepts tradition as evidenced when Adiewere takes a second wife. The couple appears torn between traditional expectations and independence of new thought. A second theme in Idu is the double standard and voicelessness of women. Through the relationship of Ojiugo and Amarajeme, it is presumed that Ojiugo is the reason that the couple cannot bear children. However, when Ojiugo bears a child with another man, Amarajeme comes to understand he is sterile, is devastated, and kills himself. Ojiugo dies that same day out of devotion to her first husband, symbolic of exerting her voice and choosing marriage over motherhood. A final theme in Idu is the emerging strength of women within the African tribe. Idu is portrayed as a heroine, a woman of independent thought who is industrious and self-assertive. Ultimately, upon the death of Adiewere, Idu exerts her ultimate independence, rejects that motherhood is paramount and chooses to die and leaver her son in order to be with her husband.  Background and publication  Published in London by Heinemann Educational Books in 1970, Idu is the second work to be written by Nigerian author Flora Nwapa. Following the release of her first novel Efuru in 1966, Nwapa successfully established herself as one of the most important novelists in Nigeria being one of the first female novelists at the time. As is the case with the rest of her work, Idu was written with the intention of challenging the depiction of women in Nigerian Literature. The book was re-released once again in 1989 by Heinemann Educational Books as the 56th entry to the African Writers Series. The book has not been in publication since then and is not a part of the revamped African Writers Series by Pearson Education.  Legacy  Flora Nwapa's novels and stories take topics like marriage, social responsibility, self-sacrifice, and humanity and then questions the prevalent cultural norms associated with them . Traditionally, Igbo literature was written from a male perspective, however, Idu is written from a feminine perspective. The female characters in Idu are the ones that are displayed making sacrifices for the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù. Idu forces readers to see the female from a new perspective. The female is shown as a person with brains, feelings, emotions, and desires; they are not merely an object. Nwapa uses Idu to cast a light on problems within the Igbo community. Through her characters, she stresses the importance of healing their community to allow for a rebirth of their community and for their people. However, critics assert that Idu also leaves a legacy stating that children are not as important as love. Idu kills herself through starvation after Adiewere dies, even though she was pregnant and had a son. In a world where children come first, Idu sends the message that the love of two people is greater than the love for a child. Idu does challenge her role in the Igbo community but the fact that she is pregnant \\"problematizes the issue of childlessness\\".

Biography Hans Christian Andersen was a friend of the Danish Baron Henrik Stampe (b. 1821) and his wife Jonna Drewsen (b. 1827), as well as of Jonna's father, Adolph Drewson. He became godfather to their daughter Christine (30 October 1856 ‚Äì 9 March 1884), who had been named for her paternal grandmother Christine Stampe (n√©e Dalgas). Together, Andersen and Adolph Drewsen compiled a scrapbook for Christine's third birthday in 1859. Its 122 pages contain over 1,000 pasted-in pictures, in some cases accompanied by hand-written captions or poems. There are also a few paper cuts, an art form at which Andersen was adept. The images were collected from all kinds of European publications, and the result offers a unique pictorial snapshot of European culture of the 1850s. Similar books exist for Christine's sisters Astrid, who became a women's rights activist, and Rigmor, who married the composer Victor Bendix. Inspired by the book, Christine's granddaughter-in-law Countess Alette Bardenfleth set up a foundation to support projects related to Danish history, literature, language, and music. The foundation published Danish, English, German, and Italian editions of Christine's Picture Book in 1984; a Swedish edition appeared the following year.

It supports a large population of bald eagles that have been the subject of ongoing studies since the 1960s. The lake is from tip to tip with of shoreline. It has a surface area of and a maximum depth of , at an elevation of about . At a narrows it is crossed by a bridge carrying provincial highway 910. This road was completed in 1973 and increased access to recreational fishing. There are over 250 islands on the lake, and the lakebed is rocky, making navigation difficult but creating a good habitat for fish. There are cabins, campgrounds and fishing camps on the lake. There is a airstrip south of the lake. Besnard Lake is within the Churchill River drainage system. While much of the lake is in the Canadian Shield, its southern portion is in the boreal forest where the Mercer River brings nutrients which leads to healthy invertebrate populations that provide plenty of food for the fish which are the mainstay of the eagles' diet. They fish mainly for white sucker and cisco, and occasionally pike, walleye and burbot. Compared to the nearby and similarly sized Nemeiben Lake which is entirely on the shield, the eagle population has a higher density and stability. Bald eagle studies The bald eagle community at Besnard Lake has been studied continuously for 50 years following their discovery there by Jon Gerrard. In that time eagle population dynamics, behaviour, growth and migration have been studied, resulting in the publication of more than 50 scientific papers and the 1988 book The Bald Eagle: Haunts and Habits of a Wilderness Monarch. Over 800 eagles have been banded, and have been found to winter mainly between Iowa and Missouri, Wyoming and Montana, but some have been found as far south as Texas, Arizona and Southern California. In the 1960s it was considered that bald eagles were rare in Canada away from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. In 1966 Gerrard found 18 nests with 27 young in the area. A more extensive aerial survey of the region in 1974 found 14,000 eagles. Besnard Lake was found to be a perfect area to study bald eagles in these boreal breeding grounds. The lake has provided habitat for a stable population of about 100 eagles since the 1970s. One discovery was that the sex of immature eagles could be accurately and efficiently determined by measuring the size of the foot and length of the culmen on the beak. This led to the discovery that the sex of the young seems to be regulated by the quantity of food available, with more females (which are larger than the males) hatching when food is plentiful. On other lakes where food is less plentiful a higher ratio of males hatch.

Hilton Park, Staffordshire - seat of the Vernon family Early life Vernon was born on 18 June 1726, the eldest son of Henry Vernon MP of Hilton Park, Staffordshire. He undertook a Grand Tour through Italy and France in about 1743. He joined the army and was an ensign in the 1st Foot Guards in November 1744. In 1747, he was lieutenant and captain. By 1751 he was closely associated with the Duke of Bedford. Vernon was one of the original members of the Jockey Club. As early as 4 June 1751 the betting-book at the old White's Club records a wager between Lord March and Captain Richard Vernon, alias Fox alias Jubilee Dicky. Vernon was blackballed at the club in the following year because of his friendship with the Duke of Bedford. Horace Walpole described him as ‚Äòa very inoffensive, good-humoured young fellow, who lives in the strongest intimacy with all the fashionable young men‚Äô Sometime after this he moved to Newmarket, where he entered into a racing partnership with Lord March, commonly known as ‚ÄòOld Q.‚Äô Thomas Holcroft the dramatist, worked as a stable boy in his stables for two and a half years, and called Vernon ‚Äòa gentleman of acute notoriety on the turf‚Äô. Political career Vernon‚Äôs political career was controlled by the Duke of Bedford and his record is a story of profitable positions and dumb votes. At the general election of 1754 Vernon was unsuccessful on the Bedford interest at Camelford, but was returned in a by-election on 10 December 1754 as Member of Parliament for Tavistock. The Duke of Bedford was lord lieutenant of Ireland and in 1757 Vernon became his second secretary. He married Lady Evelyn Fitzpatrick, widow of John Fitzpatrick, 1st Earl of Upper Ossory and daughter of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower on 15 February 1759 and soon after in May was given an Irish sinecure Clerk of quit rents in Ireland. He was subsequently given a pension of ¬£500 p.a. in lieu of income of that office. Vernon was returned after a contest on the Duke‚Äôs interest at Bedford in the 1761 general election. He became clerk of the Green Cloth in April 1764 but lost the post in July 1765. Much was dependent on the Duke‚Äôs own fortunes and he was reinstated in 1768. He was re-elected at Bedford after another contest in 1768. However, in 1771 the town enfranchised a large number of freemen which outnumbered the Duke‚Äôs interest and in 1774 Vernon was moved to the safer Bedford family seat at Okehampton. He became clerk of the Green Cloth again in 1779 and held the post until March.1782 after he was returned at the 1780 general election. The English Chronicle wrote of Vernon in 1781: He is ... not distinguished either for splendour or deficiency of talents, but with a perfect mediocrity of intellectual endowments enjoys his place, breeds his horses, contrives matches, which he is said to do with more skill and success than any man on the turf, and gives a silent vote to the minister. In1784 he moved from to a seat in the Gower interest at Newcastle under Lyme. He was not given any further office and retired at the 1790 general election. Horse Racing Diomed \\"the Marvel\\" Vernon bred and owned a large number of horses. He also trained and raced them, and was one of those who began the running of yearlings at Newmarket. In 1753 he won one of the two Jockey Club Plates, and in 1768 carried off the first Jockey Club Challenge Cup with his Marquis, son of the Godolphin Arabian. At the first Craven meeting, held in 1771, he won the stakes with Pantaloon against a field of thirteen; and his three-year-old Fame by that sire ran second for the first Oaks on 14 May 1779. Diomed, winner of the first Derby came from his stables. In 1787 he won the Oaks with Annette (by Eclipse). He owned Emigrant, winner of the July Stakes in 1796. He rode himself and took part in a gentleman-jockey race at Newmarket in 1758. The Jockey Club were his tenants at the old coffee-room at Newmarket. The ground lease was purchased by him in 1771, and bought by the stewards on its expiration sixty years later Later life By betting and breeding horses Vernon is stated to have converted ‚Äòa slender patrimony of three thousand pounds into a fortune of a hundred thousand‚Äô before quitting the turf as an owner. Vernon's name is also noted in the annals of horticulture as the introducer of fruit-forcing. His peaches at Newmarket were famous. Vernon died on 16 September 1800. His daughter Henrietta married George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick at the home of her Uncle the Earl of Gower in Whitehall on 14 July 1776. Vernon's sporting traditions were carried on by his nephew, Henry Hilton, whose name appears in the first official list of the Jockey Club, published in 1835 References Sources 1726 births 1800 deaths British horse trainers British MPs 1754‚Äì1761 British MPs 1761‚Äì1768 British MPs 1768‚Äì1774 British MPs 1774‚Äì1780 British MPs 1780‚Äì1784 British MPs 1784‚Äì1790 Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Tavistock Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Bedford Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Okehampton Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Newcastle-under-Lyme ","title":"Richard Vernon (MP)"},{"id":"55353631","text":"The 1955 Oklahoma A&M; Cowboys football team represented Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College (later renamed Oklahoma State University‚ÄìStillwater) in the Missouri Valley Conference during the 1955 college football season.

Digital medicines are designed to communicate to mobile and/or web-based applications that a patient has taken a specific dose of medication at a certain time. Because of the ingestible sensor component and association with prescription pharmaceuticals, products in this category require regulatory oversight and clinical validation. Digital medicine(s) aim to improve pharmaceutical therapy by improving patient adherence.  Differentiation from similar disciplines  Digital medicine is sometimes confused with similar disciplines, including the broader category of digital health, as well as digital therapeutics, another digital health subset. Digital health offerings use digital technologies to enhance human health in some capacity. Within this broader category, programs that include a prescription medication with an ingestible sensor component are considered digital medicines. By contrast, digital therapeutics are associated mainly with web-based health management tools and stand-alone health apps, generally without a prescription medication element.  Approval pathways  The ingestible sensor component associated with digital medicines was originally approved in 2012 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health via a de novo pathway for novel, low-risk medical devices. This approval has been accompanied by FDA 510(k) clearances. The ingestible sensor is CE marked in Europe. A New Drug Application for the first fully integrated pharmaceutical with ingestible sensor component, Otsuka Pharmaceutical's ABILIFY MYCITE¬Æ (aripiprazole with Proteus ingestible sensor), was approved by the FDA in November 2017. With its approval of the digital pill, the FDA confirmed that the review of digital medicines includes assessment of the ingestible device component, and that no additional safety and efficacy data is required for the original pharmaceutical.  Indications  Digital medicines are being used for a variety of conditions in commercial and clinical settings. Medications with ingestible sensors are being prescribed in the treatment areas of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, heart failure, Hepatitis C, mental health, HIV, TB and organ transplantation. In January 2016, Barton Health became the first institution to commercially offer digital medicines to patients with chronic medical conditions. In 2016, Children's Health in Dallas, Texas became the first to commercially use digital medicines with pediatric patients.  Ethical concerns  Bioethicists have expressed concerns around technologies that log and share information about patients‚Äô medication-taking behavior. These concerns exist from the perspective of both individual and collective patient rights. However, proponents note that participation in digital medicine programs are voluntary, comply with all applicable laws and standards, and protect patient data in accordance with applicable state and federal privacy regulations, as with other data generated and stored in electronic medical records. Experts add that digital medicine programs show promise as a solution to medication adherence, and help physicians more accurately titrate dosages and determine how well the medication worked.

A British/American venture, the film stars Louis Ashbourne Serkis, Tom Taylor, Dean Chaumoo, Rhianna Doris, Angus Imrie, Rebecca Ferguson, and Patrick Stewart. The plot follows a young boy who finds King Arthur's legendary sword Excalibur, and must then use it to stop an ancient enchantress from destroying the world. Distributed by 20th Century Fox, the film was released in the United States on 25 January 2019, and in the United Kingdom on 15 February 2019. Despite receiving positive reviews, the movie failed at the box office, with estimated losses for the studio ranging as high as $50 million. It was also the second to last film to be released by 20th Century Fox, before The Walt Disney Company took control of the studio, as part of their acquisition of 21st Century Fox on March 20, 2019. Plot Alex is a twelve year old boy, just starting secondary school in a London suburb. When his best friend Bedders is bullied by older students, Lance and Kaye, Alex comes to his aid. Alex, Lance, and Kaye are given detention by the headmistress. Lance and Kaye plot to harm Alex. That night, the duo chase Alex as he heads home, but Alex hides in a nearby construction site, where he finds and extracts a mysterious sword embedded in concrete. Later showing it to Bedders, they discover that its markings identify it as Excalibur, the sword of King Arthur. Alex then playfully \\"knights\\" Bedders. The wicked sorceress Morgana awakens underground and sends her Mortes Milles demons after Excalibur. The next day, a teenager appears from inside Stonehenge and presents himself at Alex's school as a new student. The boy reveals himself to Alex as the wizard Merlin, capable of aging backward, but will occasionally shift into his elder Arthurian form. Alex plans to return the sword, wanting nothing to do with ancient myths. That night, Merlin saves Alex from a demon and explains that he has four days to destroy Morgana, or she will enslave all of England. The Mortes Milles only appear at night and can only be seen by Alex and those he has knighted, but an upcoming total solar eclipse will enable her to emerge fully into the world. Alex realizes that these events parallel an inscribed storybook his estranged father once gave him. Alex concludes he descends from Arthur through his father and later recruits and knights Lance and Kaye, who fight beside Alex and Bedders, defeating three demons. Alex declares them a new Round Table. Merlin soon tasks Alex to find the entrance of Morgana's Underworld prison. Alex leads the group to Tintagel, where he last saw his father. En route, Merlin trains them in swordsmanship. But when Morgana infiltrates the lesson, Lance betrays Alex and takes the sword for himself. Merlin barely saves them, and Excalibur is destroyed when Alex and Lance come to blows in a marsh. As Lance and Kaye start to leave, Alex calls upon the Lady of the Lake, whose arm emerges from the water and restores the sword. Resolving their differences and rededicating themselves to the quest, the four overcome a horde of demons by luring them over a cliff. Arriving at Tintagel, Alex meets his aunt Sophie who tells him that his father was an alcoholic who abandoned Alex and his mother, Mary. Sophie reveals that it was Mary who inscribed the book, which enrages Alex, feeling his mother is a liar, and he has come a long way for nothing. Merlin stops him, telling Alex that Excalibur is not handed down by birthright, but by individual merit. Alex and his friends arm themselves, and Alex uses the storybook to locate the entrance to the Underworld. Alex challenges Morgana, who takes on a monstrous form and breathes fire, but Alex strikes her down, and the children escape. Believing Morgana is dead, Alex returns Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake, knowing that the police would likely confiscate it and makes up a story for his mother, who apologizes her lie: she never told him the truth about his father or the book, because if he had known the truth to begin with, it would've made him more heartbroken. On the day of the eclipse, Merlin informs Alex that Morgana was merely wounded, and Alex realizes that he violated the Chivalric Code by lying to his mother. In desperation, Alex tells her everything that has happened, then stuns her by summoning the Lady of the Lake into the bathtub, where he regains Excalibur. At the school, Merlin enchants the faculty, and Alex knights the entire student body. During the eclipse, Morgana ‚Äì in a huge, semi draconic form ‚Äì appears with the entire Mortes Milles. The children fight back, using strategies combining medieval warfare with modern technology. Merlin casts a magic spell to pull Morgana from the world, and Alex decapitates her as she vanishes, dispelling all the demons. Alex, Bedders, Lance, and Kaye bid farewell to Merlin, who encourages them to become leaders. Alex once again returns the sword to the Lady of the Lake. Cast Production Principal photography on the film began on 25 September 2017 in London, and ended in March 2018. The film was shot in Cornwall and at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden. The visual effects were provided by DNEG, Rodeo FX, Peerless and TPO VFX, and were supervised by Joel Green, Antoine Moulineau, Laurent Gillet, Marc Hutchings, Jack Hughes and Frazer Churchill. Reception Box office The Kid Who Would Be King grossed $16.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $15.4 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $32.1 million, against a production budget of $59 million. In the United States and Canada, the film opened in 3,521 theaters, grossing $7.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing fourth at the box office. The film opened on #7 when it was released in the United Kingdom. Following its initial performance, it was announced the film was expected to lose the studios around $50 million, taking into account its high marketing costs. The poor debut of the film was attributed to the medieval subject matter mixed with a modern context, which has had several flops in the past two years, including King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and Robin Hood, and the difficulty of promoting a family film based on such material. In its second weekend, the film fell 42% to $4.2 million, finishing seventh. Critical reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 89% approval rating based on 185 reviews, with an average rating of 6.85/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Kid Who Would Be King recalls classic all ages adventures -- and repurposes a timeless legend -- for a thoroughly enjoyable new addition to the family movie canon.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 71% and a \\"definite recommend\\" of 46%.

The law overall did not enact any new principals, but its purpose was to justify and simplify the concession laws and overall regulations in Argentina with regard to the railroad industry. It was more of a gesture to foreign investors that had initially invested in building the Argentinian railroad system in the 19th century. The rail industry was very profitable for foreign investors in the 20th century, and the Mitre Law ensured that similar regulations would be continued and thus Argentina hoped for increased investment into their developing economy. it had the effect of an increase in foreign investments in railroads notably from British companies. Since Argentina lacked the iron and coal resources that were essential to an expanding economy during the industrial revolution, the Argentinian government had to offer generous deals with foreign investors because of the lack of such resources. The law permitted all railway companies, and not just foreign owned ones, to import most of their raw materials tax-free.  Criticisms of the Mitre Law  The Mitre Law follows similar practices of Liberalism in other Latin American countries, meaning opening their economies to European countries such as Great Britain, and France, also including lower tax rates to promote business growth. The Mitre Law included a clause that ensured that a 3% tax on net profits from the rail industry would go back to rebuilding and maintaining stations across Argentina. Investors however did not like this tax, even though low, it would slow profitability over time.

His son, Thomas a'Becket, Jr. (1843-1918), was also a musician and, in his youth, worked with John Philip Sousa. Despite the great renown of \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean,\\" A'Becket never received any fame from having composed it. This is quite probably because of the confusion over the anthem's authorship.

Painting by Tintoretto The Captain General of the Sea () was the wartime commander-in-chief of the Venetian navy. The post of Captain General of the Sea was filled only during wartime, by election by the Great Council of Venice, usually from one of the members of the Venetian patriciate with long experience in naval affairs, although occasionally younger or less militarily experienced men were selected. During the later 17th century, the considerable expenses that the office entailed made the wealth of the candidates an important factor in their selection. Like all Venetian officials, the Captain General of the Sea was answerable to the councils composing the Venetian government (such as the Great Council or the Signoria) that set actual policy, but otherwise enjoyed comprehensive authority over all naval commanders and officials, as well as officials in the overseas colonies for matters pertaining to the fleet. When deciding on issues of strategy and tactics, however, he was constrained to obey the decisions of the war council, taken by majority vote. This was convened on the flagship and comprised all the commanding officers of squadrons (the Capi di Mare, signalled by the presence of a lantern on their vessels), the head of the commissariat, the commanders of any auxiliary or allied contingents, and, in case of landing operations, the commander of the troops carried on board the fleet. On campaign, the Captain General hoisted his ensign on a bastard galley, which served as the fleet flagship (the galera generalizia or Capitana). Even after the other major European navies, the Venetian fleet, and even the Venetians' major naval rivals, the Ottoman Navy, began using mostly sail ships of the line during the 17th century, the tradition-minded Venetians insisted, despite heavy debate, to keep a galley as the Captain General's flagship. Only two exceptions to this are known, in 1617 and in 1715. The crew of the flagship enjoyed special privileges, and was exempted from the usual deductions of pay for the coverings of the rowing benches. They also received free of charge a red coat, red breeches, and a red cap. In combat the flagship took position in the centre of the Venetian formation. In case of the Captain General's death he was replaced either by the Provveditore Generale da Mar, or the most senior Capo da Mar, until such time as a new Captain General could be elected by the fleet. If for whatever reason that election was likely to be delayed, the Provveditore Generale da Mar was appointed as acting Captain General.

It was published without a word of preface to give the least hint of the whereabouts of the author, and was not covered with the pall of a Great Southern Novel! as was usually the mode novels by Southern writers were announced. It had made a reputation in Boston before it was announced that the author was a lady of Baltimore. Background In 1858, when Crane was 20, she competed with a number of her friends to see who could write the best novel. The result of the friendly competition was the work that would set Crane upon her distinguished path ‚Äì the novel Emily Chester. When the novel was completed, it was taken to Messrs. Ticknor & Fields, Boston, by a writer who was a stranger to them. She was told that they could not even entertain the idea of publishing it, as they were overcrowded with previous engagements; but upon her urging the point, she was politely allowed to leave the book for inspection. Within two weeks from that time they sent a contract for its publication, addressed to the \\"Author of 'Emily Chester; and it was not until Crane returned the paper signed in full that they knew the name of the writer whose novel they had bound themselves to publish. Nevertheless, the first edition was published anonymously. On the title page is a quotation from Goethe, \\"It is in her monstrosities that Nature discloses to us her secrets.\\" From the first, the book attained success. The publishers were scarcely able to supply the demand. More than this, four editions were issued by leading English publishers and the story was translated into German, meeting a cordial reception in the cultured and appreciative circles of the European world. The novel was dramatized by George H. Miles and won new fame by presentation upon the stage, exceeding the most sanguine hopes of the author as well as the adapter. The entire chorus of reviewers, including names of eminence, were enthusiastic and almost untempered in their praise. Probably no book ever written by a Maryland woman met with speedier and more marked success. To a certain extent the work was autobiographical in character, it being an article in Miss Crane's literary creed that a novel is effective just in so far as the elements of autobiography enters into its creation. Plot The opening scenes of this book, and some that are most interesting, are placed in Maryland. At the heart of the work was the dilemma of the title character, who married a respectable, if boring, middle class gentleman, and later fell in love with a more dashing man of her community. The fierce moral debate that subsequently raged inside Emily - whether to stay faithful to her husband, or to pursue her passion for her real love - eventually had a deleterious effect on her physical health. A conclusion came about, morbidly, with Emily's death. Characters It has been said that the characters are drawn from life. Whether they be drawn from individual lives or otherwise, they are delineated with a bold and masterly hand, equal to the task. In \\"Emily Chester,\\" the author is said to have idealized herself. \\"Certainly,\\" said a friend of that writer, \\"the glorious hair that crowned the head of Emily Chester belonged to Anne Crane.\\" Critical reception \\"New and Original Novel\\" was the heading of an article in the Boston Transcript, written by Edwin Percy Whipple, the essayist, in which he says:‚Äî The Hon.

MPAR could scan at angles as high as 60 degrees in elevation, and simultaneously track meteorological phenomena, biological flyers, non-cooperative aircraft, and air traffic. From 2003 through 2016, there was one operational MPAR within the mainland United States‚Äîa repurposed AN/SPY-1A radar set loaned to NOAA by the U.S. Navy. The MPAR was decommissioned and removed in 2016. NOAA and the FAA plan to eventually decommission their NEXRAD, TDWR and ASR radars in favor of several hundred phased array radars conceptually similar to MPAR.  History  The MPAR was derived from a U.S. Navy shipborne radar, the AN/SPY-1. First seeing service beginning in 1973 when it was installed on the USS Norton Sound, the AN/SPY-1 became the standard air search radar of the U.S. Navy and the navies of several other allied nations. During use, it was discovered that the false- alarm rate was high due to the radar detecting swarms of insects and clutter from nearby mountainous terrain. Although problematic for a military air defence radar, this is ideal for a weather radar, and made phased array radars a prime candidate for implementation in the meteorological spectrum. As different versions of the AN/SPY family arose through the 1990s, in 2003 the U.S. Navy loaned a surplus AN/SPY-1A radar to NOAA for meteorological research. NOAA built a tower and pedestal to house the antenna and its components at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma.  Deployment and uses  May 31, 2013 Oklahoma Phased Array Radar Reflectivity Conventional radars typically use a large, parabolic dish to focus the radar beam, and rely on motors to move the dish in azimuth and elevation. By contrast, phased arrays are an antenna array, composed of many small antennas on a flat panel, which steer the radar beam electronically by changing the phase of the signal emitted from each antenna element. The signals from each element add together in the desired direction, and cancel out in other directions, a phenomenon known as interference. This capability can obviate the need for motors and moving parts, which increases the reliability and can decrease the cost of the system. However, the angles in which a flat panel phased array can steer its beam is limited to a maximum of approximately 120¬∞, with 90¬∞ being more realistic. This means that four panels, mounted at right angles to each other, are required to provide full 360¬∞ coverage‚Äîor, fewer panels (even just one), mounted on a rotating pedestal as with a conventional dish radar. An alternative is to construct the radar out of many tall but narrow antenna strips arranged in a cylinder. From 2003 to 2016, the MPAR formed the core of the National Weather Radar Testbed (NWRT), used as a proof- of-concept test to validate the meteorological potential of phased array radars. The MPAR provided much faster volume scans, comprehensive wind profiling, and more complete insights to supercellular structure, while simultaneously tracking aircraft. Due to the temporal resolution ranging from 30 to 60 seconds and the one-sector scanning solution used by MPAR, severe storm and tornado warning lead times increased as much as 8 minutes from the already existing 13 minutes. One drawback of the MPAR, when compared to the currently-deployed NEXRAD radars, was that MPAR did not support dual- polarization‚Äîthat is, the polar orientation of the radar beam. Dual- polarization technology exploits the fact that falling rain droplets have a flattened shape as a result of air resistance, and thus return a different signal in the horizontal plane than in the vertical. Similarly, other objects‚Äîsnow, hail, birds and insects, smoke‚Äîalso reflect the radar beam differently in the two planes. These differences are measured by the radar, computer algorithms process the data, and produce conclusions about the nature of the detected precipitation. Polarimetric radar provides improvements in tornado detection, rainfall rate measurements, precipitation type discrimination, and more. Dual-polarization capability was rolled out to the existing NEXRAD radars beginning in 2011, and was complete by April 2013. MPAR, being a 1970s design, did not have polarimetric capability and retrofitting it would have been costly, if not impossible. This limitation was addressed in the MPAR successor (see section below). Besides meteorological observation, MPAR was capable of air traffic surveillance‚Äîthis was the original role of the powerful AN/SPY-1 radars from which MPAR was derived. The capability to detect and track aircraft while simultaneously monitoring the weather attracted the attention of the FAA, which operates numerous radars for air traffic control purposes (e.g., ASR series), as well as localized weather radars near airports (TDWR units) to detect dangers to aircraft such as flocks of birds, wind shear, and microbursts, amongst others. Nine different dish- based radar models could be replaced by one phased array radar. Consolidating these different types of radars and their functions into one model would lead to cost savings by the reduction of up to one third of radars needed, streamlined training and maintenance, and an increase in reliability through commonality of spare parts.  Retirement and successor  Although MPAR was a powerful radar with unique features unavailable to conventional meteorological and air-surveillance radars, it was an old design, using old parts, and its hardware upgrade potential was severely limited; in many respects it was inferior to conventional radars. To make way for a more advanced radar, MPAR was decommissioned and removed from its tower structure on 26 August 2016. The Advanced Technology Demonstrator flat panel antenna MIT Lincoln Laboratory headed the project to design a dual-polarity MPAR successor, incorporating the many lessons learned from the development and operation of MPAR. The prototype, called the Advanced Technology Demonstrator (ATD), was installed on 12 July 2018 on the tower formerly housing the MPAR, and it is expected to become fully operational in 2019. Like MPAR, the ATD radar is an S band flat panel phased array with a 90¬∞ field of view. It is composed of 76 square panels, each with 64 radiating elements (for a total of 4,864 elements), arranged on a antenna., and mounted on a rotating pedestal similar to those used by NEXRAD dish antennas.

He made his international debut for Pakistan in April 2018 and his Test match debut for the team in December 2018. In 2017, Afridi was noted as a 6-foot 6 inch 17-year-old Pakistani fast-bowling talent who can bowl 90 mph, 25 July 2017 and also for his big-hitting ability. He considers himself an all-rounder and seeks to excel in bowling, batting and fielding. In August 2018, he was one of thirty-three players to be awarded a central contract for the 2018‚Äì19 season by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Early life and career Shaheen belongs to the Zakhakhel Afridi tribe of the Pashtuns. He grew up in Landi Kotal, a town in Khyber District, Pakistan, on the border with Afghanistan. He is the youngest of seven brothers; his eldest brother, 15 years his senior, is Riaz Afridi who played a solitary Test match for Pakistan in 2004. Shaheen started his cricket career from the Tatara Ground in Landi Kotal, which is named after the nearby Tatara hills. Riaz Afridi introduced Shaheen to hard- ball cricket at the FATA Under-16 trials in 2015, with Shaheen having played only tennis-ball cricket until then. Success at this level led Shaheen to selection for the Under-16 tour of Australia in November 2015 where he played his part with four wickets in the 2‚Äì1 victories in the One-Day and Twenty20 series. Domestic and T20 career In December 2016, Afridi was included in the Pakistan Under-19 cricket team selected for the 2016 Under-19 Asia Cup held in Sri Lanka.

The short is one of three short films, alongside 2036: Nexus Dawn and 2048: Nowhere to Run, that serve as prequels to the live-action film Blade Runner 2049. It debuted on 27 September 2017 on Crunchyroll.  Plot  Three years after the events of Blade Runner, the Tyrell Corporation has developed the new Nexus-8 line of replicants, who now possess natural, open-ended lifespans equivalent to that of a regular human. This causes a massive backlash among the human populace, who begin hunting down and killing replicants, seeing them as a now very credible threat to humanity. One of these replicants, Trixie, is attacked by a group of thugs but is rescued by Iggy, who effortlessly disarms and kills them. Iggy reveals to her that he used to be a soldier on a planet called Calantha but deserted when he realized the enemy soldiers he had been fighting and killing were also replicants. Iggy recruits Trixie for an operation carried out by an underground replicant freedom movement to destroy the Tyrell Corporation's database of registered replicants, so that replicants can no longer be hunted. Trixie befriends Ren, who is a technician in charge of launching nuclear missiles and a replicant sympathizer. Ren agrees to redirect a test missile to detonate over Los Angeles, blacking out the city and wiping out all electronic data. At the same time, Trixie and Iggy hijack a fuel truck to physically destroy the Tyrell Corporation's servers. However, Trixie is killed while battling security forces with Iggy. The operation is a success, with the servers destroyed and power to Los Angeles disabled. Iggy manages to escape and removes his right eye, the only thing that can identify him as a replicant. The ending narration states that in the aftermath of the Black Out, all replicant production was banned and the Tyrell Corporation went bankrupt, only for the Wallace Corporation to acquire the company and restart production of a new model a decade later.

It proved popular, with over forty built; an early example was taken on an aerial survey of Antarctica. One survives. Design and development The Aristocrat is a high, braced wing monoplane with a two-part wing of rectangular plan apart from clipped tips, mounted to the fuselage without dihedral. The wing structure is entirely wooden and built around spruce box-spars and girder ribs. Apart from the leading edge, which is reinforced with aluminium sheet, the surfaces are fabric covered. Parallel pairs of steel bracing struts run between the lower fuselage and the spars at about mid-span. The majority of Aristocrats were powered by Warner Scarab seven-cylinder radial engines, though later variants had more powerful radials. Photographs show them uncowled. Behind the engine, the lower fuselage of the Aristocrat is flat- sided and built from welded chrome-molybdenum steel tubes. Its enclosed cabin is largely under the wing though the pilot's windshield is ahead of the leading edge and close to the engine; behind the pilot, there are seats for two passengers, who enter by two large doors, and rear baggage space. Behind the wing leading edge, the upper fuselage surface is raised with a fairing. The Aristocrat's empennage is steel framed and fabric covered. Its tailplane is mounted at the top of the fuselage and the horizontal tail is straight- tapered in plan out to rounded tips. The tailplane is in-flight adjustable and braced from below with a single strut on each side, carrying balanced elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement. The fin is small and almost triangular but the rudder, also balanced, is tall and blunt-topped. The undercarriage is of the fixed, cantilever, tailwheel type and has a track of . Each faired undercarriage leg is a strongbox, formed from aluminium sheet and hinged on the lower fuselage longeron. Their tops are joined to a rubber spring shock absorber mounted centrally on the cabin frame below the pilot's seat. The wheels have brakes. The tailwheel's castoring is also restrained by rubber springs. Operational history The first flight of Aristocrat was at the end of July 1928. Two more prototypes were built and the second prototype accompanied Richard E. Byrd's aerial survey expedition to the Antarctic in late 1928-early 1929. These were followed by thirty-one examples of the production type 102-A, all with the same Scarab engine as on the prototypes. Models 102-B to 102-D, with different engines were proposed but not built. Six examples of the 102-E, powered by a Wright J-6-5 five-cylinder radial engine were completed in 1931-2. The large increase of power raised the Aristocrat's cruise speed up to . One 102-E was fitted experimentally with full-span Zap flaps and retractable Zap ailerons (spoilerons) by NACA in 1932-3. A photograph shows that this 102-E, at least, had a much-modified undercarriage with the wheels on simple V-struts and with vertical shock absorber legs to the forward wing spars. The final Aristocrat variant was the 102-F, fitted with a Continental A-70. There were six of these, one converted from a 102-E. General Airplanes was liquidated in 1931. Aristocrat N(C)278H, built in the 102-A batch, was restored in 1986 and given a Continental radial. It remained airworthy until at least 2010. Variants ;102: Scarab powered.

The case led to a widely reported on trial in which seven co-defendants (Chris Turner, Charles Turner, Kelvin Smith, Levy Rouse, Clifton Yarborough, Timothy Catlett and Russell Overton) were tried and convicted of the crime. After allegations that the prosecution had suppressed evidence of another suspect an appeal was heard by the United States Supreme Court in Turner v. United States. The court upheld the conviction of the men.  Attack  Catherine Fuller, a 49 year old housewife, was attacked on her way to the grocery store in Washington, DC on October 1, 1984. She was robbed of US$40 and cheap jewelry. She was sodomized with a metal pipe and beaten to death. Her body was found by a street vendor in a garage in the alley behind the 800 block of H Street NE.  Arrests and investigation  The police described the crime as a \\"gang attack\\". The police at the end of the investigation had arrested 17 individuals, all of whom were members of the alleged \\"8th and H Street\\" Crew.  Legacy  The case contributed to the view that crime had become rampant in Washington D.C and shaped the views of Washingtonians. The case was the subject of an episode of the Netflix true crime documentary series, The Confession Tapes, which suggests that the confessions were falsified, and that the murder may have actually been committed by a convicted serial rapist and thief, James McMillan, who lived and had been spotted in the area of the murder earlier that day.

The company's founders, Sarah Ribner and Jess Edelstein, did not accept Corcoran's offer after a year of negotiations and became self-funded. Background The name \\"PiperWai\\" comes from a combination of Edelstein's family dog's name, Piper, and a Guyana tribe called the Wai Wai. The brand is best known for developing all-natural deodorant made from charcoal, which was created in a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania kitchen. Edelstein gave the product to Ribner to test during a trip to South America in November 2013. Afterward, Edelstein and Ribner received a $2,000 loan from their parents to produce the raw materials and develop a website. PiperWai was co-founded by Ribner and Edelstein in March 2014.

She was vice-president of Catholic Action's Superior Council of Women, and was responsible for the Adult Education Commission of the World Union of Catholic Women's Organizations (Uni√≥n Mundial de Organizaciones Femeninas Cat√≥licas; UMOFC), a position that required her to travel around the world, experiencing diverse living conditions that shaped her later writing. She also directed one of the few university dormitories for girls in Madrid. Throughout her life she was linked to Catholic Action, of which she was a national leader for more than twenty years, and to the Centers of Popular Culture, which she presided over until 1968. In 1960 she co-founded the Seminar on Women's Sociological Studies with the support of Mar√≠a Laffitte and the participation of Lil√≠ √Ålvarez, Elena Catena, and Consuelo de la G√°ndara. It became a nucleus of moderate and intellectual feminism, and a forerunner of modern gender studies in Spain. Co-founder of Manos Unidas Also in 1960, Salas was one of the founders and first national president of , and together with Pilar Bellosillo (the sole Spanish woman auditor at the Second Vatican Council), was a fundamental part of the World Union of Catholic Women's Organizations. She was responsible for initiating the Campaign Against Hunger in Spain, and penned many of the earliest articles which disseminated the ideas contained in the UMOFC's 1955 foundational manifesto. In 1968 she traveled to Sub-Saharan Africa with Pilar Bellosillo on a mission to promote women's issues. After a meeting in Kinshasa, they traveled to the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, and Senegal to train Catholic leaders of the new era of independence. Earlier, they toured Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico in a one-month course for the training of leaders, paid for by UNESCO. Among Salas's missions, the one which left the deepest mark on her was the one which led her to India. As she explains in her memoirs, In 1977 she was a candidate to the Congress of Deputies for Burgos for the left-wing Democratic Party led by Joaqu√≠n Ruiz Gim√©nez. She wrote assiduously for the journals Ecclesia and ', and was a regular columnist for the new edition of the magazine Signo. She retired from writing in June 2008 due to illness. Commitment to women's rights In 1959 Salas published her first work, Nosotras, las solteras, dedicated to women who decided not to marry. Her biographer explains that she wanted to dignify this personal option and keep it away from \\"the rancid spinsters that appeared in many jokes.\\" In 1960 she co-founded the Seminar on Women's Sociological Studies, promoted by Mar√≠a Laffitte, a pioneering gender and equality studies group in Spain that served as a bridge between moderate feminism of Christian Democrat circles and that of more uncompromising feminist groups. Pope Pius XII encouraged her in her commitment to women's rights. recalled words from a tribute to her in Alandar: In 1986, together with Pilar Bellosillo, Dolores Aleixandre, and Marif√© Ramos, Salas promoted the creation of the Women's Studies Forum (Foro de Estudios sobre la Mujer; FEM), a space for Christian women to explore new ecumenical horizons with European networks.

Early life  Stewart was born on June 19, 1855 in Hudson, New York. He was the son of Lispenard Stewart (1809‚Äì1867) and Mary Rogers Rhinelander (1821‚Äì1893). He was the brother of Sarah Lispenard Stewart (1837‚Äì1920), William Rhinelander Stewart (1852‚Äì1929), and Mary Rhinelander Stewart (1859‚Äì1949), who married Frank S. Witherbee. Through his brother William, he was the uncle of Anita Rhinelander Stewart (1886‚Äì1977) who married Prince Miguel, Duke of Viseu, grandson of King Miguel I of Portugal. His paternal grandparents were Alexander Stewart and Sarah (n√©e Lispenard) Stewart. He was the maternal grandson of William Christopher Rhinelander (d. 1878). He graduated from Yale in 1876, the same year he entered Columbia Law School, graduating in 1878. During his second year in the law school studied also in law office of Platt & Gerard.

Whitney, Miss Sybil Sherman, Cornelius Vanderbilt. While still in law school, he was admitted to the office of the estate of his great-grandfather, William Rhinelander. He was admitted to the bar May 27, 1879, and then became created a firm with his brother, known as \\"William R. Stewart & Lispenard Stewart, Attorneys\\" which they ran until 1900. He devoted most of his time to the administration of estates, charitable, philanthropic, and educational work. In January, 1877, he was granted power of attorney for his mother and two aunts. After his grandfather's death in June 1878, he was named one of three executors and trustees, by his grandfather, in November 1878. The estate of William Rhinelander, who was a prominent merchant, was valued conservatively at $60,000,000 upon his death. By the time of his mother's death in 1893, the estate was said to be worth $75,000,000 with annual income in excess of $3,000,000. He was elected a director of the Rhinelander Real Estate Company in 1903, becoming its first treasurer. He served until November 1921 when poor health forced him to resign. He was then elected vice-president of the company, serving in that role until his death in 1927. Political career Stewart was the New York County representative to the Republican State Committee, serving as its treasurer. He was also a delegate to the National Republican Conventions in 1896 and 1900 and a presidential elector in 1888 where he acted as Secretary of the Electoral College.

Dietrich, 1977, Memorial to Anna I . Jonas Stose, 1881 -1974, Geological Society of America Bulletin, v.6 Ftp://rock.geosociety.org/pub/Memorials/v06/Stose-AIJ.pdf [1] was a major geological pioneer, who worked for the American Museum of Natural History, Maryland Geological Survey, Pennsylvania Geological Survey, Virginia Geological Survey, and the United States Geological Survey. She is best known for her work mapping the Appalachian Mountain Range, documenting the structure of and exposure to the rock formations, and tracing crystalline rocks. Stose was among the first to implement petrographic and structural techniques to the Appalachian Mountains, which were still in development at the time. This was rare because women at this time didn't do physical work in the fields, and her hard efforts are now noted and appreciated. She contributed largely to the Geologic Map of Virginia and the Geologic Map of the United States.  Early life  Anna was the only child to George and Mary Hughes Gilbert Jonas and grew up in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Her parents ran a family-owned business called the Williamstown Glass Company where she worked during World War I as a cashier. Anna was known to be fond of her ancestry that included relatives who emigrated from New England to Cape May in the 1690s. Her lineage is made of relatives who were plantation owners in Cape May, whalers, and Delaware River Pilots. She began her mapping in Southeastern Pennsylvania and Maryland. Then on, she began her mapping Southwestward into the crystalline rocks of Virginia to North Carolina afterwards. In 1938, Anna married George Willis Stose who worked as a U.S. G.S. stratigrapher and would end up working by her side on the Appalachian Mountains.  Education  Anna received formal education from Bryn Mawr College and earned her A.D in 1904. In 1905, she earned her A.M, and then her Ph.D in 1912. Furthermore, she had an education major in the Arts. Throughout her college career, Anna had the opportunity to work under tenured female geologists, who she would continue to work with closely after graduating from college. From 1908 to 1909, she was an assistant curator at the Geology Museum and worked extensively in the geology laboratories during college. Her classmates included Eleanora Knopf and Julia Gardner, and she mentored under Florence Bascom, one of the pioneer women of geology. Between 1916 and 1917, she began work at the Department of Geology, following that she worked at the American Museum of Natural History.  Geological contributions  Anna contributed to geology simply by being a woman during a time when women faced prejudices for being active in such a field. In her professional career as a geologist, Anna was known to be very outspoken. During Anna's long career in the scientific community, she made numerous geological contributions, including identification of structural characteristics and trends by using maps that she printed in colour. Instead of creating 5 by 6 quadrangle maps, Anna's work was focused on creating larger scaled maps. Working with Eleanora Knopf, Anna helped defined the Martic Line. They believed it to be a major thrust fault in Pennsylvania. Her ideas were often considered to be incomprehensible by other geologists at the time, as her work was far too advanced. Being a female in this time also caused scientists to often disregard or overlook her ideas. Stose and Knopf provided many contributions when it came to defining and naming important places, such as the Conestoga Limestone, this being a major part of Pennsylvania, the major units of the Blue Ridge Province, many of the granite plutons in both there and Piedmont, and gave the Mount Rogers volcanic sequence in southern Virginia. The Piedmont and Blue Ridge provinces in the southern and central Appalachians were the locations where Anna's studies led her to one of her greatest achievements. Anna printed a map in colour of the Piedmont and Blue Ridge Rocks on the 1982 Virginia State Geological map, which was not accepted in the geological community at the time, but with today's enhanced understandings and technology, we have realized her theories and findings were ultimately correct, and her discoveries are still used in science today.  Findings from the Appalachian Mountains  Throughout her research over the Appalachian Mountains, Anna worked alongside her husband George W. Stose, and many of their findings were published together. Crystalline rock makes up the southern Appalachian Mountains and was mobile during Pre-Cambrian to the Palaeozoic era. During this time, there was intense crust folding and intrusion to the rock formation. Once the crust folding ceased, granite rock carved through the inner part of the mountain range.  Publications  Anna's publications spanned sixty years. In 1905, she published her first paper, it focused on the rocks of the crystalline Appalachians. In 1965, she published her last paper that described the cataloging of lithologies, and the potential origins of 18th-century tombstones in old cemeteries located in Cape May County, New Jersey. In her last paper she also noted that the correlation of certain rocks dated back to Early Paleozoic rocks. Anna was the first person to identify that the Brevard Zone rocks depict a fault zone. Her proposed explanation was that the Zone marked a major thrust fault. Afterwards, contrary to Stose's theory, other geologists supposed that the Zone was actually the trace of a large strike-slip fault. For many years, this idea obtained widespread acceptance, but at the present time, Stose's explanation is believed to be more accurate. In a book called Studies of Appalachian Geology: Central and Southern, which was published in 1970 and edited by George Fisher, Stose is the geologist with the most listings in the author index. Stose and her husband, George Stose, compiled county wide reports such as the ‚ÄúNew Holland quadrangle‚Äù (Jonas and Stose, 1926), ‚Äú Geology and Mineral Resources of York County‚Äù (Stose and Jonas, 1939), ‚ÄúMiddletowne quadrangle‚Äù (Stose and Jonas, 1933). These reports laid the foundation for southeastern Pennsylvanian geology. In 1944, the couple wrote a report on the Geology of the Hanover-York District (published by the U.S. Geological Survey). This is their only work that is formally listed as Stose and Stose, and is still acknowledged by today's geologists due to the advanced explanations and illustrations contained within the publication.  Later life  Anna spent time working at the American Museum of Natural History throughout 1916 and 1917, she then worked as a geologist for the Maryland and Pennsylvania Geological Surveys between 1919 and 1937. She worked as a geologist two more times, firstly for the Virginia Geological Survey from 1926 to 1945, and secondly with the U.S. Geological Survey from 1930 until her retirement in 1954. Anna later died on October 27, 1974, due to a stroke, while George Stose died back in 1960. Her work is still used today as a tribute of her contributions to field of geology in a time where women weren't recognized.

He was born at Llanllwchaiarn, Newtown, Powys and died at Coton Hill, Shrewsbury, Shropshire.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. Wingfield was educated at Rossall School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, Wingfield was a right-handed middle-order batsman and, in his early career at least, a wicketkeeper. He cemented his place in the 1855 University team with an innings of 69 in only his second first-class game, the match against the MCC, and this remained his highest score. He played in the University Match against Oxford University in each of his three seasons at Cambridge, but only in his last year did he make much impact, though his 54 in Cambridge's second innings was insufficient to prevent a defeat. Cricket was not his only sport at Cambridge: he won a Blue as cox of the Cambridge rowing eight at Henley in 1855 and was then cox of the successful Cambridge boat in the Boat Race 1856. Wingfield also played for the Gentlemen of the South team and was a county cricketer for Cambridgeshire, and, from 1855 to 1879, Shropshire.

A child prodigy on the violin, she studied in Brazil and Spain and performed internationally. At the end of World War II, she moved to Paris and performed as a soloist with the Cologne Orchestra. In 1964, she and the Quarteto da Guanabara received the first prize from the international Villa- Lobos String Quartet Competition and in 1966, she was awarded the Carlos Gomes Medal in Rio de Janeiro. Early life Mariuccia Iacovino was born on 12 December 1912 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She began studying music at a young age and by the time she was six years old, had passed the examinations to enter the Instituto Nacional de M√∫sica. In 1924, when the school created its orchestra, now known as the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Symphony Orchestra, Iacovino played in the premier performance, along with and , under the direction of Ant√¥nio Francisco Braga. Studying violin under the master violinist , Iacovino graduated at age fifteen, having won the gold medal. In 1928, she traveled to Barcelona, Spain to continue her studies with Enrique Fern√°ndez Arb√≥s and . She spent a year touring and studying in Spain before returning to Brazil to study with d'Ambr√≥sio and Heitor Villa-Lobos. While studying with Villa-Lobos, Iacovino met the noted pianist , whom she would marry. Career In the 1930s, Iacovino performed with and Alfredo Gomes and taught at the Lorenzo Fernandez Academy of Music in Rio de Janeiro. She founded and became the director of the Quartet Society in 1943, heading the organization to 1947. At the end of World War II, Estrela was invited to move to Paris and he and Iacovino relocated there in 1945 along with their daughter Myrian Dauelsberg. The duo Iacovino-Estrela performed throughout Europe making numerous trips to the Soviet Union, also performing in Angola, China, and often in Poland and Portugal. In 1949, she was hired as the soloist of the Cologne Orchestra in Paris, which was under Villa-Lobos's direction at that time. She performed in the debut of his Fantasia de Movimentos M√≠sticos (Fantasy of Mystical Movements), considered Villa-Lobos's most complex work for violins. In 1952 she attended the Congress of the People for Peace held in Vienna, along with Estrela, Jorge Amado and Candido Portinari. The attendance at this Congress would later create problems during the McCarthy Era, when Iacovino was denied a visa to perform in the United States. In 1954, the couple returned to Brazil and founded the Guanabara Quartet. Besides Iacovino and Estrela, the other two members were Iber√™ Gomes Grosso on cello and Frederick Stephany on viola. Traveling throughout Europe, the quartet played fifty-two concerts, featuring music by Brazilian composers, which were well received. In 1964, they were honored with the first prize in the international Villa-Lobos String Quartet Competition. Two years later, Iacovino received the Carlos Gomes Medal in Rio de Janeiro. In 1968, she became the first violinist to record the Violin Sonata in A-major, Op. 14 by Leopoldo Migu√©z. That same year, she co-founded the Sociedade Villa Lobos (Villa Lobos Society), with her husband and Lourdes Tornaghi to promote concert performances in Petr√≥polis. Between 1969 and 1979, during the military dictatorship the quartet was unable to travel and regularly played at the Municipal Theatre of Rio de Janeiro. Preferring to play to live audiences, Iacovino did record six CDs. Some of her most noted recordings include Camargo Guarnieri's Sonata No. 4; Migu√©z's sonata; and Tr√™s Sonatas para Violino (Three Sonatas for Violin), Duo para Violino e Viola (Duo for Violin and Viola), Trio de Cordas (String Trio) and Ch√¥ros bis, all by Villa-Lobos. Iacovino continued performing until shortly before her death and the length of her career was at one time a record holder in The Guinness Book of World Records. Death and legacy Iacovino died at her home in Rio de Janeiro on 16 May 2008. Since the creation of the Villa Lobos Society, more than 500 concerts have been held in Petr√≥polis. Numerous artists, including Camargo Guarnieri, Radam√©s Gnattali, Francisco Mignone, Ronaldo Miranda, Marlos Nobre, Almeida Prado and Alexandre Schubert wrote works in her honor.

A language scholar for the British Museum during the 1960s, she became a companion of the Eighth Doctor alongside Liv Chenka. Character history The character first appears in The Red Lady, where she met the Eighth Doctor and Liv Chenka who were in search of a temporal anomaly related to the Eleven while working as an assistant to Professor Walter Pritchard. She joined them in their investigation of artifacts connected to the Red Lady and helped them defeat her. Helen was dismissed from her position, as her boss was suspicious that she was behind the artifacts' theft, and accepted the Doctor's offers to join him and Liv on their travels. She joins their efforts to track down the dangerous Time Lord criminal the Eleven. During her travels with the Doctor, she encounters River Song, with River trusting Helen with the secret of her true history with the Doctor despite the risk of a younger Doctor learning about her existence. One trip sees Helen meet her brother in 2008, during which she learns that she can never return to her time despite her family's reputation being seriously tainted by her apparent theft of the artefacts, forcing her to claim to be her own daughter. In the final episode of Doom Coalition, Helen is last seen trapped in a damaged TARDIS with the Eleven. She returns in the following audio series, Ravenous, where she has spent some time trying to help the Eleven after the TARDIS crash-landed in an asylum, but her efforts are proven to be a failure as the Eleven attempts to take control of the local system with the aid of the Kandyman. Having rejoined the TARDIS crew, Helen gets caught up in a crisis in Salzburg when a mysterious wish- granting entity causes the Krampus to become real. To stop this threat, Helen spends thirty years piloting the TARDIS until she finds Bishop Nicholas in the fifth century, the original inspiration of Father Christmas, bringing him into the present so that he can order the Krampus to release its victims, Liv using her own wish to restore Helen to youth. As the TARDIS crew are forced to join the Eleven to face the Ravenous, a race of beings who essentially 'eat' regeneration energy, Helen is briefly abducted by Missy- a female incarnation of the Master- to translate a map that leads to the location of Artron, an ancient Time Lord scientist. Artron is revealed to be the wish-granter the trio encountered in Salzburg, who unintentionally created the Ravenous when he was manipulated by the Master (from a time shortly after their confrontation in San Francisco) into draining the energy from a mysterious race. As the Eleven joins the Ravenous to try and destroy the universe, the two aforementioned Masters join forces with the War Master to confront the Eleven, while the Doctor is able to help Artron realise how he can undo his mistake and 'cure' the Ravenous, restoring them to their original state at the cost of his own life.

Set on wooden pavements, resting on hard marl benches, crossing obliquely the course of the river, some sixty high oak and iron mills, which supplied energy to the local millers, were divided between three fords of the Garonne: the Daurade, the Ch√¢teau Narbonnais, and the Bazacle.\\"The Garonne and the ancient vestiges\\" by Henri Molet, Memoirs of the Archaeological Society of the Midi of France Very narrow and with a length of nearly half a kilometer, these \\"carriageways\\" made it easier to anchor the mills on several large reinforced piles, in order to better benefit from the hydraulic energy provided by a fall in the Garonne of a height of 4 meters. The main one, the Bazacle dam, mentioned in 1177, was 400 meters long. It consisted of trunks of oak trees sunk into the bottom of the river. In 1183, shortly before the Albigensian Crusade, the Count of Toulouse officially authorized the construction of this causeway, which linked the two banks of the river at a width of a hundred meters. The first floating mills were built nearby to better exploit the current. To force the waters of the river in the wake of the mills, industrialists of the time set up levees which required regular maintenance work due to damage from high water and flooding. Because the construction and repairs required significant sums of money, their owners were forced to unite. Conflict with Daurade Mills Because they were downstream from the Moulins de la Daurade, those of the Bazacle could considerably hinder them by the height of their causeway. After attempting unsuccessfully, between 1278 and 1329, to raise theirs to the detriment of the Moulins of the Ch√¢teau, the owners of the Daurade wanted to guard against the companies of those of the Bazacle. In 1316, they obtained an arbitration which fixed the maximum height of the roadway of the Bazacle.See Sicard, \\"Toulouse mills in the Middle Ages\\", pp. 106 and 107. After the great flood of 1346 which destroyed the Moulins du Ch√¢teau and probably damaged those of the Daurade, the pariers of the Bazacle took advantage of the damage caused on their cause by Charles le Mauvais,Lieutenant King in Languedoc from May to November 1351. to obtain in 1356 authorization from the Parliament of Paris to rebuild much higher than before. This resulted in immediate complaints by the shareholders of Daurade, whose mills could no longer function. They won their case in 1358 but could not enforce the judgement because of a call that dragged on until 1366, when the Parliament of Paris ordered that the pariers of the Bazacle lower their pavement and pay 1,000 livres tournois to the owners of the Daurade. The sum was paid in 1367 but the Mills of the Daurade were ruined for years. The floor, it does not moveBazacle pariers will play in the vagueness of the judgment of the Parliament about the costs of demolition. See Sicard, op. cit. , p. 113 , note 60. ... The last pariers or shareholders of Daurade still tried to force those of the Bazacle to comply with court decisions in 1380, in alliance with the pariers of Ch√¢teau, unhappy with the new floor built at the Bazacle after the flood of 1377-78. They obtained a new condemnation of the Bazacle, which was not executed any more than the previous one because of long calls and exhaustion of the complainants. Dropped by the pariers of the Ch√¢teau, the pariers of Daurade obtained permission in 1384 to withdraw, which they did one after the other until the extinction of the complaint in 1408.On all this, see the chapter \\"An example of conflict between private interests and the rights of waters pariers Bazacle and Daurade in the second half of the XIVth century\\" in Sicard, op. cit. , pp. 108 to 118. Operation In order to raise the capital needed for the construction of these dams, the millers formed a company to which they entrusted their savings, in return for which they received notarized papers attesting to their investments. These notarial papers were called uchaux. They were anonymous, as are the stocks of current limited companies, so they could pass from hand to hand quickly, and ownership of three companies operating the dams was eventually transferred from the millers to the Toulouse bourgeoisie, who were eager for good investments.https://web.archive.org/web/20160606141301/http://www.herodote.net/histoire/synthese.php?ID%3D69 The company consisted of 96 uchaux or shares, which the owners had the right to resell without consent or right of preemption of the other partners. These shares were exchanged at a price which varied according to the economic situation, i.e., the good or poor operating results of the mills. From 1372 onwards, the Soci√©t√© des Moulins de Bazacle owned the mills and not only the causeways connecting them. It no longer served only to share equally the work of maintenance of the causeways but also to distribute the benefits of the operation of the mills. Each owner of shares or \\"uchaux\\" had an interest in one-sixteenth on each sack of wheat deposited by the peasants who came to grind their wheat. The mills were unparalleled in prosperity and their owners, these \\"gentlemen of the Bazacle\\", made a fortune. For the first time, capitalist companies were being spoken of, because their owners, the pariers, received their revenues according to their shares. In the Middle Ages, the old mill became the first known per-action company and this hard monopoly existed until 19th century. On the eve of the French Revolution, the commune of Toulouse authorized the installation of nine amidonniers - hence the name given to the district - five tanneries and two paper mills... \\"In the 18th century, the mills of Bazacle were a famous example of technical modernity throughout Europe and appeared in the Encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert\\".Toulouse secret et insolite, par Corinne Cl√©ment et Sonia Ruiz The dividend, paid in kind, was equivalent to 120,000 pounds of flour per year in 1771.Dictionnaire universel de France, par Robert de Hesseln, 1771 It was not paid in cash until 1840, with the appearance of the Soci√©t√© Anonyme du Moulin du Bazacle. Modern history In 1840, the Soci√©t√© Anonyme du Moulin du Bazacle appeared. In 1886, it converted into of one of the first hydroelectric plants in France and took the name of the Toulouse Electricity Company.https://web.archive.org/web/20110223233318/http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2010/10/29/937855-Le- Bazacle-du-capitalisme-a-l-ecologie.html by Gauthier Guigon, in La D√©p√™che du Midi of December 29, 2010 In 1876, the company of the mills of the Bazacle issued for the first time new shares to the number of 135, with the same rights as the old ones. In 1887, the site and equipment of the Bazacle were leased to \\"The Toulouse Electricity Company (STE)\\". The motive power of the mills was distributed to several factories along the Canalet, using an underground network. The first factory to use this energy was the Boyer- Fonfr√®de cotton factory, founded by a Bordeaux entrepreneur in 1790. Another famous factory was the Garrigou scythe, which was in operation until 1865. At that time, the activity of the 500 workers of the factory was intense. It was said that one could hear \\"the noise of the hammers, which throughout the year, day and night, resounded in the quarters of the Bazacle.\\" In 1888, the Toulouse Power Corporation transformed the Bazacle mill into a hydroelectric plant. The Toulouse Electricity Company absorbed the Soci√©t√© Anonyme du Moulin du Bazacle; the merger was effective in 1910. The new entity was called the Toulousaine Electricity Company of the Bazacle (STE). It eventually came under the control of the Reille group, via its backing of the Pyrenean Electric Power Company. The company was finally nationalized in 1946. The installation belongs to EDF and still functions. In the 20th century, the factories located along the banks closed one after the other. The tobacco factory, whose production exceeded 2,300 tons per year in the 1950s,http://www.persee.fr/doc/ingeo_0020-0093_1954_num_18_4_1410 was the largest plant in the sector. In 1910, it employed nearly 2,000 workers, mostly women. The last Ninas brand cigarillos were produced in 1979 and the definitive closure of the factory was announced in 1987. Its disappearance marked the end of the industrial exploitation of the Garonne in Toulouse. In the memory of Toulouse, the Bazacle is a symbol of the economic miracle which benefited the city until the end of the 19th century. A place of toil and wealth production for almost ten centuries, the monument has re-emerged in recent years from the ashes of its glorious industrial past, transformed into a space devoted to discovery and culture. The characteristics and power of the current hydroelectric plant, reflecting the exploitable power of the site, are a flow of 90 m3/s equipment, a drop height of 4 to 4.7 meters and an installed capacity of 3000 kilowatts.https://www.edf.fr/groupe-edf/producteur- industriel/energies-renouvelables/hydraulique/espace-edf-bazacle/presentation References History of finance Food and drink companies of France √âlectricit√© de France Companies based in Toulouse ","title":"Bazacle Milling Company"},{"id":"55356473","text":"Templeton The Grove is a heritage listed building of historical significance located south of Narberth, Pembrokeshire.The Grove: A Grade II Listed Building in Templeton, Pembrokeshire, British Listed Buildings website.

The film features Parul Yadav in the lead role and is being simultaneously shot in Tamil as Paris Paris.  Cast  * Parul Yadav as Parvati * Elli Avram as Vijaylakshmi * Varun Shashi Rao * Sudha Belawadi * Bhargavi Narayan  Production   Development  In June 2014, Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, the producers of the Hindi film Queen (2014), made an official announcement that they hold sold the remake rights for the Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada versions of their film to Thiagarajan, who would make the films through his production studio, Staar Movies. Viacom put a caveat in the agreement that the principal photography of any of the films must start by 8 June 2017, else the rights would revert to Viacom. Soon after the announcement in June 2014, several Indian directors and actresses expressed their desire to do the film, but Thiagarajan maintained that no one had been finalised and that he was still considering his options. Thiagarajan announced his potential plans of casting Lisa Haydon to reprise her supporting role and for his son Prashanth to act in the film, but remarked that he was unsure if Prashanth would accept to play a character with \\"grey shades\\". Samantha held discussions about portraying the film's lead role during July 2014, but turned the film down after being unconvinced about the way the original script was set to be adapted into the South Indian regional languages. After a period of inactivity and further media reports about the casting of the lead actress, Thiagarajan revealed in February 2016 that he had signed on Revathi to direct the Tamil version of the film, while Suhasini would work as the dialogue writer. Soon after, Nayanthara turned down the opportunity to work on the film citing scheduling issues during early 2016. In mid-2016, Trisha was also approached to play the lead role but conflicting schedules meant that she could not sign on to appear in the film. The media also linked actresses Parvathy and Nithya Menen to the lead role, but neither were signed on. During an interaction with the media in November 2016, Thiagarajan revealed that he had finalised Revathi to direct the Tamil and Malayalam versions of the film, while Anish Kuruvilla and Prakash Raj would make the Telugu and Kannada versions respectively. He added that Tamannaah would feature in the lead role of the Tamil version, while Amala Paul and Parul Yadav would reprise the role in the Malayalam and Kannada versions respectively. He also stated that Amy Jackson was signed on to feature in all four versions of the film in the role originally portrayed by Lisa Haydon. In June 2017, further confusion about the remake arose after two separate production houses apart from Thiagarajan's Staar Movies had claimed rights to the film. As per a contract signed on 30 July 2016, Staar Movies agreed to enter into a co-production agreement with Mediente International Films Ltd and Liger Commercial Brokers for the making of the films. However a mutual cancellation form was then signed between the parties on 5 April 2017 after Mediente allegedly failed to pay the consideration provided under the agreement. Then, as per a contract signed on 21 April 2017, Staar Movies agreed to assign the rights of all four South Indian versions of Queen to Golden Crab Film Production Ltd. In order to avoid the reversion of rights back to Viacom due to three years of inactivity, Staar Movies and Golden Crab swiftly began shooting the film in Tamil on 17 May 2017 with a series of supporting actors including Nassar under the title of Vaanil Thedi Nindren. However, on 3 June 2017, Staar Movies again assigned and transferred the remake rights of the film to Mediente and Liger, with the Kannada version of the film titled Butterfly featuring Parul Yadav, starting immediately with Ramesh Aravind taking over as director. A few days of shoot for the film were subsequently held during early June 2017 with Sudha Belawadi and Bhargavi Narayan also featuring in the schedule. Staar Movies then produced a declaration affidavit on 14 June 2017 that any agreement with Golden Crab Films was false. In late September 2017, Mediente announced that the Tamil version would be made as Paris Paris (2018) with Kajal Aggarwal, the Malayalam version would be made as Zam Zam with Manjima Mohan and the Telugu version would star Tamannaah. Amy Jackson was initially in talks to play the role Lisa Haydon played in Queen however opted out due to unavailability of dates and creative differences. Writer Mamta Sagar was signed to help adapt the script and opted to set the film in Gokarna, while music composer Amit Trivedi was signed to work on the Tamil and Kannada versions.  Filming  The film was launched in Bangalore on 4 June 2017 with director Ramesh Aravind and actress Parul Yadav in attendance. Production began with a five-day workshop, with a test shoot being conducted for Parul's looks in the film. After the launch of the other language versions, the team announced that they would film scenes in Gokarna, followed by schedules in Paris, Barcelona and London.  Post- production  Elli AvRam lent her own voice in Kannada for first time despite not knowing Kannada language, simultaneously with Tamil.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Amit Trivedi with lyrics by Yograj Bhat and Jayanth Kaikini.

In 531, he led the Saxons to victory over the Thuringians at the battle of Burgscheidungen, \\"a legendary victory, and one so great that [Hadugato] appeared to [later] Saxons as an epiphany of divinity itself.\\"Karl Hauck, \\"The Literature of House and Kindred Associated with Medieval Noble Families, Illustrated from Eleventh and Twelfth-century Satires on the Nobility\\", in Timothy Reuter, ed., The Medieval Nobility: Studies on the Ruling Classes of France and Germany from the Sixth to the Twelfth Century (Amsterdam, 1979), pp. 61‚Äì85. The Chronica ducum de Brunswick records that in the Duchy of Brunswick in the sixteenth century a memorial week was still observed following Michaelmas (September 29) to celebrate the Saxon victory over the Thuringians.Raymund F. Wood, ed. and trans., The Three Books of the Deeds of the Saxons, by Widukind of Corvey: Translated with Introduction, Notes, and Bibliography, PhD diss. (University of California, Los Angeles, 1949), p. 238, n. 107. Battle of Burgscheidungen The earliest source to mention Hadugato is the Translatio sancti Alexandri of Rudolf of Fulda. This was begun in 863 and completed after Rudolf's death in 865 by a monk named Meginhart. The account in the Translatio is repeated almost verbatim in the Deeds of the Bishops of the Church of Hamburg of Adam of Bremen, written between 1073 and 1076.August Wetzel, Die Translatio S. Alexandri: Eine kritische Untersuchung (Kiel: 1881), pp. 84‚Äì85, presents the relevant Latin texts of the Translatio and Adam of Bremen in parallel. According to this account, the Saxons arrived in the region of Hadeln (Haduloha), having sailed from Britain, during the war between Irminfrid, king of the Thuringians, and Theuderic I, king of the Franks. The latter, \\"his hope of conquering frustrated, sent messengers to the Saxons, whose leader [dux, duke] was Hadugato ‚Ä¶ promising them a place in which to settle in the event of victory.\\" The Saxons fought \\"as if their own liberty and country were at stake\\", and Theuderic kept his promise.Adam of Bremen; Francis J. Tschan, trans., History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen (Columbia University Press, 2002), pp. 8‚Äì9. The most extensive account of Hadugato is found in Widukind of Corvey's Deeds of the Saxons, completed around 967. Widukind's account also appears in a close paraphrase in the world chronicle of Frutolf of Michelsberg (died 1103). In this version, the Saxons, as allies of the Franks, defeat the Thuringians beneath the walls of Burgscheidungen on the Unstrut. Their leader is not named. After the battle, Irminfrid offers to make peace and join Theuderic in driving off his Saxon allies. When word of this reaches the Saxons, a council is held at which \\"a certain one of the veteran soldiers, already somewhat older, but still vigorous in advancing old age, who by merit of his great valor was called father of fathers [pater patrum], by name Hathagat\\", gives a speech after taking the \\"standard that was held sacred among them, marked with the likeness of a lion and a dragon, and an eagle swooping from above.\\" According to Widukind, he urged the Saxons to attack the unsuspecting Thuringians, putting himself forward as their leader. In the night, they scaled the walls of Burgscheidungen, massacred the Thuringian men, raped their women and forced Irminfrid and his court to flee.Wood (1949), pp. 170‚Äì79.Sverre Bagge, Kings, Politics, and the Right Order of the World in German Historiography, c. 950‚Äì1150 (Brill, 2002), p. 65. The pagan Saxons then set up an altar of victory and \\"celebrated the appropriate rites with all due solemnity, according to their ancestral superstition\\" for three days. They even \\"raised their leader [duke] to the skies with their praise, declaring him possessed of divine courage and god-like valor who by his constancy had led them to win such a victory.\\" All this took place, Widukind says, \\"as the memory of our elders testifies, at the Kalends of October,\\" i.e. on October 1.Bagge (2002), p. 57, n. 130. Pagan significance? The German historian Karl Hauck argues that the oral tradition of Hadugato that Widukind records contains a display of sacral kingship, with Hadugato being worshiped as a god. He qualifies the worship of such battlefield leaders as a \\"temporary\\" deification. He also sees pagan significance (an autumn festival) in the date.Karl Hauck, \\"Lebensnormen und Kultmythen in germanischen Stammes- und Herrschergenealogien\\", Saeculum 6 (1955), pp. 186‚Äì223, at 217‚Äì18. Clive Tolley has argued that Widukind is in fact describing an ad hoc Irminsul (sacred pillar) rather than a true altar. He argues that Widukind's somewhat garbled passage indicates that the real name of the \\"altar\\" was Hirmin (which the Saxon historian glosses as Hermes) and its form was that of a pillar.Clive Tolley, \\"Oswald's Tree\\", in Tette Hofstra, L. A. J. R. Houwen and Alasdair A. MacDonald, eds., Pagans and Christians: The Interplay Between Christian Latin and Traditional Germanic Cultures in Early Medieval Europe (Groningen: 1995), pp. 151‚Äì52.Carole M. Cusack, The Sacred Tree: Ancient and Medieval Manifestations (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2011), pp. 137‚Äì38. Name The name Hadugato (as in Adam of Bremen), Hadugoto (as in the Translatio), Hatugato (as in Frutolf) or Hathagat (as in Widukind) is preserved only in sources written centuries after his life. The form Hathugast that appears in some modern works is etymologically incorrect.J. O. Plassmann, \\"Review of Friedrich von der Leyen, Das Heldenliederbuch Karls des Gro√üen. Bestand‚ÄìGehalt‚ÄìWirkung.\\", Historische Zeitschrift 186, 1 (1958), pp. 98‚Äì103. According to Hauck, the name is probably no more than an honorific, Hathugaut, meaning \\"Gaut of battle\\", in reference to Gaut, the legendary ancestor of the Geats and of the royal houses of the Goths and the Lombards.The Amal dynasty of the Goths begins with a legendary Gapt and the Gausian dynasty of the Lombards begins with a legendary Gausus. A similar name, Sigeg√©at, meaning \\"Gaut of victory\\", is preserved in Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies. The name \\"Gaut\\" itself would just be another by-name for Wodan (Odinsheiti).Herwig Wolfram, The Roman Empire and Its Germanic Peoples (University of California Press, 1997), p. 26.See Karl Hauck, \\"Herrschaftszeichen eines Wodanistischen K√∂nigtums\\", Jahrbuch f√ºr fr√§nkische Landesforschung 14 (1954), pp. 9‚Äì66, at 36‚Äì7, for more discussion of the 'name' Hathugaut as a sign. Hauck treats Widukind's phrase pater patrum as a variation of pater patriae (father of the country). \\"The most noble house 'represents' the tribe\\" and Widukind clearly presents Hadugato as the most noble. In Hauck's view, Widukind is presenting Hadugato as the ancestor of the Liudolfings, the ruling house of Saxony in his own time, without presenting an actual genealogy. Hauck's conclusions are not universally accepted, since the connection of the name Gaut to Wodan comes only from later Norse sagas. Without sources written hundreds of years after the earliest accounts of Hadugato, no divine meaning would be attached to the -gat(o) suffix in his name. Without the later sources, these names would have remained \\"empty and unnoticed\\" in Eve Picard's words.Eve Picard, Germanisches Sakralk√∂nigtum?: quellenkritische Studien zur Germania des Tacitus und zur altnordischen √úberlieferung (Heidelberg: 1991), p. 36.Walter Goffart, \\"Two Notes on Germanic Antiquity Today\\", Traditio 50 (1995), pp. 9‚Äì30, at 18.

It was constructed between 1688 and likely completed in 1773. The church is dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary and is constructed in the Baroque style with a Rococo frontispiece. The church opens to Travessa Tav√°res, a broad avenue, with a view to the Paragua√ßu River. The church is dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The church and convent are connected to the House of Prayer of the Carmelite Third Order; the two form a single architectural complex. The church and convent, as well as the Carmelite Third Order church, was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938. The convent was converted to a guest house in the 20th century and is known as the Pousada Convento do Carmo. History The Carmelites arrived in Brazil in 1586, following the Jesuits and Benedictines. The expansion of the order in Brazil was limited by the invasion of the Dutch in Brazil, 1630-1654. Friar Manoel da Assun√ß√£o, the Carmelite provincial vicar of Bahia and Pernambuco, sent emissaries to the interior of Bahia in the late 1680s as part of an expansion of the order in Brazil. Construction of the Church and Convent of Our Lady of Mount Carmel began in 1688. Jo√£o Rodrigues Adorno, son of Gaspar Rodrigues Adorno, the founder of Cachoeira, donated land to the Carmelites \\"at the foot of the slope behind the houses of Francisco Lopes\\". Work on a retreat was completed in 1692. In addition to the Carmelite structure, Jo√£o Rodrigues Adorno donated land to the Society of Jesus to construct the Church of the Old Seminary in Bel√©m da Cachoeira in the same period, north of Carmelite church and convent. The site of the Mount Carmel church and convent was part of a sugar cane mill owned by Adorno. Brother Manoel da Piedade founded the convent, which was constructed between 1715 and 1722. 15 friars and 12 brothers occupied the building by 1743; the low occupancy of the buildings in this period indicates the building was not fully functioning. The church was constructed between 1752 and 1759 under Father Ant√¥nio de Bel√©m Lemos. The date on the frontispiece of the church, 1773, refers to a restoration of the church to add a gallery between the wall of the frontispiece and the door of the nave and the installation of an organ. The convent was renovated to house the battalion of a militia, which it housed between 1817 and 1823. It was again adapted to function as a mint between 1822 and 1823. The mint operated for only a month. It was also used as a school, town hall, courtroom, and hospital in the 19th century; by the end of this period the rich art collection and most the interior of the elements of the church and convent were lost. The convent became a guest house in the 20th century. Location The Church and Convent of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located on Rua Inoc√™ncio Boaventura at the Pra√ßa da Aclama√ß√£o, a plaza, in the Caquende neighborhood of Cachoeira. The church and convent are connected to the House of Prayer of the Carmelite Third Order to form an architectural complex called \\"the most important urban space\\" by IPAC. A small hill above the convent, which now houses a children's hospital, is known as Morro Mangabeira. The hill frames the architectural complex in vegetation. The sugar mill of Jo√£o Rodrigues Adorno was located on the flank of the hill. Structure The Church and Convent of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is a two-story structure with a raised frontispiece. It consists of a church to its left (north) side and a convent to its right (south) side. Its walls are of mixed masonry. Church The frontispiece is in the rococo style and advances onto the street. It has a wide covered gallery with five semi-circular arches, three of them occupied by wooden doors. Five choir windows are above the portals. In contrast, the fa√ßades of the convent and the Church of the Third Order are, in comparison, sober. The pinnacle of the fa√ßade is in three parts with five semi-circular arches. The flaming rococo pediments, according to the art historian Germain Bazin, display elements of Chinese architecture, probably via the influence of architecture in the Portuguese colony of Macau. A bell tower rises above the right side of the church; it is recessed from the fa√ßade. The design of the church is similar to that of the convents of Carmo, Gra√ßa and Desterro, in Salvador, all constructed in the same period. The church plan is typical to others of the period; it has a rectangular plan with a single nave with two side aisles superposed by tribunes and a cross sacristy. Its side corridors are superposed by tribunes and deep chapel. The church interior was richly decorated, but very little remains of its original decoration. The high altar has four Solominic columns with intricate carvings. Figurative tiles remain in one of the lateral chapels. Its main image was moved to the museum in the Church of the Third Order. The church ceiling features trompe-l'oeil paintings from the school of Antonio Sim√µes Ribeiro and Jos√© Joaquim da Rocha. The sacristy has decoration in the rococo style. It has a small altar with carving work, two chests of drawers, and a lavabo of Lias stone imported from Portugal. Convent The convent consists of a central cloister surrounded by semi-circular arcades of brick. Access to the convent is from the south. Stone Tuscan columns support the porch of the convent. The convent has nine wings, two halls, a refectory, kitchen, catacombs, and smaller miscellaneous rooms. A coat of arms of the order in stucco is the sole remaining interior element from the original convent; it is located on the door of the cloister that gives access to the stair of the building. The porch door that opens to the street is the sole remaining exterior element of the convent. A chapel in the catacombs of the convent has mud carvings. Protected status The Church and Convent of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and House of Prayer of the Carmelite Third Order were listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938. It was listed in the Book of Historical Works no. 181.

Vulcan was a mining camp established along Camp Creek in 1894 and was deserted within thirty years.  History  In 1894, prospectors discovered gold in the sagebrush-covered hills in southern Gunnison County near the Saguache County line. Word spread quickly and within a year's time several mines were operating along what was termed the Vulcan vein. The mining camp of Vulcan grew rapidly and had a population of 500 by the summer of 1895. In March 1896, the town's first newspaper, the Vulcan Enterprise, was published. The mines along the Vulcan vein were productive, with the Good Hope, Mammoth Chimney, and Vulcan seeing the most ore shipped. But life in Vulcan saw disruptions brought on by labor disputes between union workers and owners, litigation among the mine owners, problems associated with the high sulfur content of the rock, and destructive fires. It was just a few years before the mines began playing out. By 1906, essentially all gold, silver, and copper production had ceased. The marketable sulfur deposits in the area extended Vulcan's life. Beginning in 1906, sulfur was mined and shipped until a catastrophic fire ended operations in 1910. Vulcan received yet another pulse of activity when copper mining and smelting recommenced in 1916, but this activity was short lived and operations ceased by 1919. In 1920, Vulcan had a population of two. Today, only a few dilapidated structures remain. The Gunnison Gold Belt Vulcan, Colorado, circa 1896. Vulcan was the most productive mining town to appear along the Gunnison Gold Belt, a gold-rich greenstone belt that spans over across southern Gunnison County and adjacent Saguache County. Multiple gold strikes resulted in mining operations and short-lived mining camps throughout the belt. The camps included Camp Willard (established in 1880), Cochetopa (1880), Dubois (1892), Spencer (1893), Midway (1894), Vulcan (1894), Iris (1894), Chance (1894), Taliafaro (1895), and Sillsville (1903). These towns grew rapidly after a strike, were occupied by hundreds of residents within months, and were often abandoned just as quickly. Saloons, boarding houses, general stores were common. Many had post offices and some had schools. The camps were a combination of wooden and tent buildings so enduring structures are rare. All of these camps are now abandoned and time has wiped away evidence of their once robust existence.

ÈóΩÂè∞Ê∞ë‰øóËø∞ËÆ∫. Most of these groups are related to Baiyue, and indeed ancient Han Chinese had literature that documented such customs being practiced by various Baiyue tribes. Practice Cantonese traditions Among Cantonese, the standard practice of bone collecting involves first unearthing a coffin with a dead body that has been buried for at least five years (thus can be expected to have largely decomposed), and then leaving the coffin partly open in order to let out the stench of decay. As the stench became bearable, the dead person's offspring would, using Cantonese, formally asked the dead person to \\"wake up\\" (Jyutping: Hei2 san1 laa3; Traditional Chinese: Ëµ∑Ë∫´Âñá). After some rituals, the \\"bone collector\\", a person specifically trained to do this ritual, would respectfully and carefully collect the bones from the coffin (hence the name \\"bone collecting\\"). The next step involves cleaning and drying the bones, which usually takes at least four to five days. The final part of the ritual depends on the offspring's will: They may want to grind the bones into ashes, or put them into containers called \\"golden towers\\" (Jyutping: Gam1 taap3; Traditional Chinese: ÈáëÂ°î, literally \\"golden tower\\"). These containers will then be put in the countryside or cemetery for a peaceful rest. In Cantonese customs, choices of where to put the golden towers may be dependent on Feng shui. In Hong Kong and Macau, it is legally mandated that bone collecting must be conducted after 6 to 7 years of burial on land.

It was also minted in the Spanish Empire, and a silver coin of the same value was minted by the Knights of Malta. The name is derived from the ancient Roman uncia. It may sometimes be translated ounce. In the medieval kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, one oncia was equivalent to 30 tar√¨, 600 grani and 3600 denari (pennies). Conventionally, a sum of money is indicated by numbers of oncie, tar√¨, grani and denari separated by full stops, thus 2.2.15.1 indicates 2 oncie, two tar√¨, 15 grani and 1 denaro.

Their film debut features the trio staging pranks that were too elaborate to put on YouTube. The movie was produced by Collective Digital Studios and distributed by Lionsgate. The trio wrote the feature and it was directed by Ben Pluimer and Atwood, in his directorial debut. The movie also has numerous cameos by social-media personalities including Jenna Marbles, Furious Pete, Jukka Hild√©n, Dave England and Tom Mabe. Plot summary The movie is a series of stunts and pranks pulled on unsuspecting victims. Some of the pranks include, but not limited to: pulling a sexually themed prank on masseurs, attempting to convince critics a painting made of fecal matter is real art, pretending to get third-degree burns at a tanning salon, pretending to kill dogs in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant. They scared sunbathers on a Miami Beach by dropping a realistic looking plastic snake in the sand, had eating contests, shot each other with confetti cannons and jolts from electric fly zappers. In one elaborate stunt, they convinced a pregnant wife to prank her husband by pretending she had given birth to an African-American baby, neither the husband or wife was African-American. They also staged murders and alien abductions. The film also featured clips from their YouTube channels. Cast * Roman Atwood * Dennis Roady * Vitaly Zdorovetskiy ; Cameos * Dave England * Kevin Brueck * Furious Pete * Jukka Hild√©n * Tom Mabe * Jenna Marbles * Brittney Smith * Radio DJ Big Boy Production The process of writing and developing the pranks and stunts for the film took two years, and it was filmed in 30 days. In addition, they had guest writers from Punk'd helping them advance concepts. Atwood said they developed 400 pranks overall, but only ended up using about 32 in the movie. The trio had to get their pranks approved by the legal department and insurance providers, with their lawyers telling them \\"no a lot\\" for some of their stunts. None of the pranks featured in the film were safe for YouTube, as they violated the terms of service of the video platform. Hidden cameras were used with men in disguises, pretending to be homeless pushing a cart and dads pushing strollers. Police officers traveled with them to defuse situations where the person being pranked was upset and wanted to call the police. The three have also faced physical confrontations sometimes with their pranks. Roady recalled an incident in Finland, where the prank was kidnapping a woman in front of a group of people, putting her into the trunk of a car, and was confronted \\"by a guy\\", and his \\"nose got cracked\\". In another stunt involving a car enthusiast, he caught them trying to siphon gas from his car and took off his belt and swung it at them, nearly missing the three. In 2014 Zdorovetskiy created headlines when he streaked across the field of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final in Rio de Janeiro, with the words ‚ÄúNatural Born Pranksters‚Äù written across his chest. Reception Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times was highly critical of the film saying \\"In borrowing the model of ‚ÄúJackass‚Äù and ‚ÄúPunk‚Äôd,‚Äù this ‚Äúfilm‚Äù lacks the essential DNA of what made those shows appealing...these pranksters...aren‚Äôt nearly so generous, and their sadistic stunts display a deep mean-spirited streak, resulting in racist, sexist and homophobic harassment. UK based Vulture Hound wrote \\"The intro sequence is brief, high octane and fun, giving the audience a taster of what‚Äôs to come...the pranks are of expected viral quality - invasive, boundless and some are downright extreme, exactly what made them infamous...ultimately, the film falls victim to its own ambition and slips into monotonousness in the effort to remain shocking, avant-garde and interesting. Through the quest to include more and more great content, it becomes a hindering overload. The Irish World website wrote: \\"the movie is obviously trying to tap into the loyal and engaged fan base of YouTube stars...but the non-stop gags get a bit tedious after a while, and maybe that‚Äôs why the mischievous stars have enjoyed so much success in the one-off short video market on the video sharing platform...there are several laugh-out-loud moments at the expense of the prank victims, but perhaps this movie is best left for teenage boys who will undoubtedly love the toilet humour and silly gags. Jennie Kermode at EyeForFilm.co.uk wrote that the movie is \\"hit and miss...it's a good first effort for an amateur team and parts of it work very well indeed...it has done well in linking its sketches together and creating the sense of momentum necessary to sustain this sort of thing in the cinema, but the sketches themselves are not all strong enough to work for what's likely to be a tougher audience. Its natural home is on DVD where is can be watched in fragments, much like the original show\\". Release The film was released on iTunes, theatrically in limited markets, and via DVD. On its opening weekend, the feature was number one on iTunes in comedy and ranked number two overall on the video on demand platform. In the international market, it was in the top 10 of 18 territories, with the United Kingdom, Denmark and Norway being the top markets.

It was once considered the best preserved and most complete hillfort in North-West Wales, but completely disappeared in the first half of the 20th century due to a massive quarrying effort by the Darbishire family; which overwhelmed and eventually destroyed all traces of it, despite efforts by the Royal Commission to save the site.  Eyewitness description of the hillfort  1909 photo of wall at Braich-y-Dinas, by H. Picton and W. Bezant LoweOne of the earliest written accounts of the fort comes from Thomas Pennant, who visited the site as part of his 'A Tour in Wales' series (1778‚Äì1783). He gives the original height of the mountain as 1545 feet and noted its excellent preservation. The hilltop was defended by massive ramparts of roughly coursed rubble masonry, with no orthostats. By the mid 19th Century these still stood in places to a height of 9 ft., and varied from 8 to 15 ft. in thickness. The number and character of the entrances were uncertain. The interior contained 90 or more huts of various shapes but mostly oval with a usual diameter of 10‚Äì20 ft. Their walls were of similar construction to the rampart, about 5 or 6 ft. thick, and stood in places to a height of 4 ft. Summit top cairns were noted by another 18th Century antiquarian ‚Äì Governor Thomas Pownall ‚Äì (writing in 1771), and indeed three are included on the detailed 1877 plan (see image in infobox). These are speculated to have been early Bronze Age, which would date organised human activity on the site to at least c. 2000-2500 BC. The wider area is well known for its Neolithic activity, and indeed the Neolithic Axe factory of Graig Lwyd ‚Äì one of the largest in Wales ‚Äì can be found nestled at the Southeast corner. All datable objects were originally assigned to the period AD 100‚Äì400, and no evidence was found to indicate more than one period of construction, but T. Driver of the RCAHMW speculates that this conclusion is almost certainly incorrect; noting that the surviving plans of the fort suggest several periods of construction. The evidence of the relics suggests that the most prosperous inhabitants of the fort were those living between the outer and middle ramparts, as all the Samian pottery, and four of the six coins found, came from this part of the fort. The site produced saddle querns, but none of the rotary type'. An eyewitness account of the site from Archaeologia Cambrensis correspondent H. Longueville Jones; details the hillfort as seen in 1845, as follows: 1877 Illustration of a hut, at Braich-y- Dinas \\"Upon reaching the fortified British post of Braich y Dinas, on the summit of Penmaen Mawr, we found the circuits of stone walls still perfect in some parts, but greatly dilapidated in others. They are about 12 to 15 feet height, and about 12 feet thick; of loose stones, not fitting into each other with any attempt at masonry, but merely the shattered debris of that rough mountain piled together by human art. There is no appearance of mortar, nor of vitrification. Between the walls, and inside the central inclosure, but especially on the north eastern side of the summit, are a vast number of small circular cells, or cyttiau, which no doubt served for the habitations of the persons occupying this fortified post, and similar to those so common on the Caernarvonshire hills. Some of them were singularly perfect, and one, near the present north western entrance to the fortress, is still covered with its roof, but we could not penetrate within, and we did not feel ourselves justified in attempting to remove the stones.\\"  Finds from the site  Photograph of the bronze mount found at Braich-y-Dinas. Bronze bracelet found at Braich-y-Dinas. Notable finds from the site include a bronze mount (pictured), which Harold Hughes, writing for Archaeologia Cambrensis, speculated belonged to a handled tankard; based on other, similar pieces from the wider area. Hughes also describes two matching bronze bracelets, ornamented with concentric circles, a design, he conjectured, would have been derived from Celtic, rather than Roman inspiration. Datable finds from the fort include a Middle Bronze Age looped spearhead, Roman coins featuring the Emperors Nerva (reigned 96 AD ‚Äì 98 AD), Trajan (reigned 98 AD ‚Äì 117 AD) and Hadrian (reigned 117 AD ‚Äì 138 AD); as well as numerous pottery fragments, most from late 1st and early 2nd Century AD, with some fewer appearing from as late as the 3rd and 4th Centuries AD. Also found at the site was a large saddle quern, and a sandstone spindle whorl.  Efforts to save the site  On 10 August 1908, a Royal Commission was authorised and appointed by King Edward VII to 'make an inventory of the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Constructions connected with or illustrative of the contemporary culture, civilisation and conditions of life of the people in Wales and Monmouthshire from the earliest times, and to specify those which seem most worthy of preservation'. From 1909, the newly-founded commission made efforts to rescue the already partly-destroyed site from further harm caused by the extensive quarrying being undertaken by the Darbishire family. Several local newspaper articles from June 1909 attest to this, reporting that MP for Carmarthen District Llewelyn Williams raised the issue of Braich-y-Dinas (named as 'Pendinas') with the Prime Minister, only to be told that the 600 jobs sustained by the quarry took precedence over the prehistoric remains. Having failed in Parliament, attention was turned 'to the creation of a strong public opinion to bring pressure to bear upon the quarrying company concerned with a view of the preservation of the summit of a mountain at Penmaenmawr.' In 1910, an article about the destruction of Braich-y-Dinas appeared in British newspaper The Sphere, which was also picked up and reported across the Atlantic in the New York Times. Ultimately unsuccessful and faced with the imminent destruction of the site, members of the commission made several visits to the Braich-y-Dinas hillfort in order to preserve some written record of the remaining structures; and an extensive survey was undertaken by Harold Hughes for the Cambrian Archaeological Association.  Destruction of Braich- y-Dinas  Comparison between 1923 aerial photograph of site, and modern day satellite imagery.Evidence given before the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales in February 1912, confirmed that blasting work was currently under way on the crest of Penmaenmawr. Upon examination by the Commission, the Crown Receiver of His Majesty's Woods and Forests Department for Wales and Monmouthshire, Mr William Henry More confirmed that there was no provision in the lease ‚Äì held and managed by Colonel C. H. Darbishire ‚Äì for the preservation of the camp. He also argued that extending the quarry in any other direction than towards the camp would be 'impractical and impossible'; speaking from the financial point of view of the owner of the lease. The land in question was described as residing partly on 'Crown wasteland' and partly on 'land sold many years ago to Mr Darbishire, reserving minerals'. It emerged during questioning that surveys of the area from 1840 conducted by one Mr John Jones, failed to show any antiquarian remains at the site. There was some confusion as to the current extent of the damage to the site ‚Äì indeed Mr More initially described the incursion of the quarry as \\"small\\"--but it was conceded upon further examination that because of recent expansion of operations at the blasting site, much of the remaining area must necessarily have already been destroyed. Mr More later admitted to having misled the commission by claiming that only \\"a small part\\" of the site was contained within the current lease; when in fact the lease was actually provisioned for an area containing the \\"whole of the camp.\\" When asked whether it was within the remit of the Department of Woods and Forests to collect information 'respecting the history' of the properties in its charge; Mr More answered that the department had always been run 'to the advantage of the public revenue.' Somewhat contradicting this confused testimony, an RAF aerial photograph taken eleven years later in 1923 appears to show much of the camp still intact; with the shapes of over 50 huts still visible on the mountainside (see comparison image); and indeed finds were still being recorded from the site up until 1934, at the earliest.  Modern day  Nothing at all remains of the hillfort at Braich-y-Dinas.

History  The construction of the castle began in the 13th century, by order of the lords of Andrade. According to ancient sources, the building had a tunnel that connected the house of the Andrade family with the castle, whose members and relatives were to seek refuge during periods of war. In 1467, the fortress was attacked by Afonso de Lanz√≥s, who was captured and locked in the castle by order of Nuno Freire de Andrade, o Mao. One of the most famous owners of the castle was Fern√°n P√©rez de Andrade, lord of Pontedeume and Ferrol, to whom Henry II of Castile, granted him all the lands that went from the castle to Cabo Prior (Ferrol). In 1367 Fern√°n ordered the remodeling of the castle, which was completed by the year 1371. The castle is located on an isolated crag, and at the time of its construction, was surrounded by a moat, and had a place of arms and drawbridge. The tower is square, and the walls have three widths. The building consists of three floors, with a height of twenty meters, with views to Ares, Betanzos and Ferrol.

His travels are attested in the writings of Richard Hakluyt, who documented the ill-fated expedition. Apart from his famous journey and its immediate aftermath, little is known about the life of Richard Hore. In Hakluyt's Principal Navigations One of the few contemporary accounts of Richard Hore's life is contained in The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation, a late 16th century history by Richard Hakluyt. Master Hore, described as \\"a man of goodly stature and of great courage\\" who was \\"given to the studie of Cosmographie,\\" succeeded in attracting a number of gentlemen interested in visiting the North American coast. According to Hakluyt, the expedition was to set out on two ships: the Trinity, captained by Hore himself, and the Minion, upon which sailed men such as Armigil Wade. Hakluyt derived his narrative from two sources: the testimony of Thomas Butts, son of William Butts, and Oliver Dawbeny. Dawbeny, who sailed on the Minion, had been interviewed by Hakluyt's cousin, Richard Hakluyt of the Middle Temple, while Thomas Butts, who had sailed on the Trinity, was very old when he was interviewed personally by Hakluyt as the last surviving witness to the voyage. After embarking from Gravesend in April 1536, the ships sailed for two months without sighting land until they approached Cape Breton, where they turned northeast until they reached the Island of Penguin. There the passengers killed and ate a large number of native birds as well as several bears. According to Oliver Dawbeny, at this point the English encountered some indigenous persons in a canoe, who fled and could not be located afterwards.Hakluyt, p. 4. This was likely an encounter with the Beothuk, although the possibility remains that Hore's crew had encountered the Inuit. Following this incident, the expedition began to experience serious shortage of supplies, to the point where Dawbeny relates that a man was killed and partially eaten by one of his companions. When news of this was brought to the captain, he vigorously harangued the crew on their actions before beginning to \\"exhort [them] to repentance, and besought all the company to pray, that it might please God to looke upon their miserable present state, and for his owne mercie to relieve the same.\\" Despite the denunciation of cannibalism, soon after the crew prepared to draw lots to determine which of them should be sacrificed for the survival of the rest. The unexpected arrival of a well-supplied French ship prevented this from occurring, as the English seized the French ship and left its crew to fend for themselves.Hakluyt, pp. 5-6. The return voyage passed far enough northward for the expedition to witness large icebergs in the summer months, and arrived in St. Ives, Cornwall in October 1536. They stayed for a time at the home of John Luttrell before returning home to London, where Thomas Butts was described as being so emaciated that he would not have been recognized by his parents if it were not for an identifying wart on his knee. Some time after their return, the French ship that had been attacked by the expedition arrived in England and made a petition of grievance to King Henry VIII, who was so moved by pity for his subjects that he spared them punishment but personally repaid the wronged Frenchmen in full from his own coffers.Hakluyt, p. 7. Critical scholarship Richard Hakluyt's account of the voyage of Richard Hore has been closely scrutinized by skeptical historians. E. G. R. Taylor discovered court records of a lawsuit brought against Hore by the merchant William Dolphyn, who was seeking redress for breach of contract and whose ship had been chartered for the voyage by Hore. The lawsuit, which makes no mention of undue hardships, identifies Hore's second ship as the William of London and not Minion, a probable error on Hakluyt's part. Later documents on Richard Hore detailed further legal troubles, as he had gained control of a ship called the Valentine in 1537 and within the next year was investigated for allegedly kidnapping some Portuguese subjects and then was found to be in debt to one Sir Thomas Spent. There are no other known surviving primary sources on Richard Hore, as the memoirs written by Armigil Wade have evidently been lost. Other inquiries have called into question whether any of the ship's company actually resorted to the eating of human flesh. Philip Levy theorizes that the misidentification of Hore's ship William as the Minion may have been a deliberate or accidental reference to another ship called Minion whose crew had endured hunger in 1568 while in the Gulf of Mexico. Further, the incident of man-eating which was related from Dawbeny's testimony must be seen as problematic, given the confusion in Hakluyt's narrative over which of his two sources witnessed each anecdote. Levy suggests that because the actual cannibalistic moment was not directly witnessed, it could be seen as merely a veiled threat from a sailor who had been caught eating some other kind of meat.Levy, pp. 135-137, 141-142.

It was identified as a new species on the basis of its skull, skeleton and a detailed DNA analysis. The single individual initially collected from a felled tree (Dillenia salomonensis) measured 46 cm long, weighed between 0.5 and 1.0 kg and had orange-brown fur. Its diet is believed to include thick-shelled nuts like ngali nuts and coconuts, and probably fruits. The species is likely to be designated critically endangered, due to the small amount of forest habitat (about ) remaining on the island and ongoing logging.

Both wear royal mantles. A royal mantle, or more simply a mantle, is a garment normally worn by emperors, kings or queens as a symbol of authority. When worn at a coronation, such mantles may be referred to as coronation mantles. Many princes also wear such a mantle. Sometimes the mantles are worn only once, but in other instances they may be worn or used on other occasions, such as during the opening of a session of the nation's legislature. Mantles also feature prominently in state portraiture and artwork featuring monarchs and princes. In principle, there is no difference between the mantles of an emperor and king. Different countries have their own styles, and the shape of mantles has changed somewhat over the centuries. The oldest coats were not very long, and they were not lined with fur. In the 18th century, cloaks become more like each other and appeared everywhere in Europe. The French example was lined with fur, and a cloak with a long train became standard. Only the German emperors continued their short coat from the 12th century to the end of their empire. The non-crowned but inaugurated Dutch kings wear a robe on the French model. In the Netherlands, one does not speak of a coronation mantle but uses the term \\"royal robe\\" (; Dutch phonetic: Œ≥oningsmant‚àÇl).

Background After the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, there were a number of Berber revolts against the Umayyad caliphate. These mid-eighth century revolts were associated with Kharijite teachings, which won over a good part of the Maghreb with their puritanism and egalitarian message. As a result of one of these, the Rustamid dynasty founded a kingdom at Tahert. Foundation of the Emirate Around the same time, a revolt of the Zenata tribe of the Banu Ifran broke out. The rebels proclaimed their leader Abu Qurra to be the Caliph, and he established a Sufri state in Tlemcen. Although the founding of this city is sometimes attributed to the Ifranides, the site had already been occupied by the Roman city of Pomaria. Little is known of the internal affairs of the new state, but it was of considerable military significance. Expansion In 767, united with the Kharijites of Tahert and Nafusa Mountains, Abu Qurra launched an expedition to the east, surrounded the Abbasid governor in the fortress of Tobna in the Aures and reached as far as Kairouan. Back in Tlemcen, he allied himself with the Maghrawa and had to confront the expansionist aims of the Idrisides. The Abbasids sent a strong army under the new governor, Yazid ibn Hatim al- Muhallabi, who defied the Kharijites in Ifriqiya, but the rest of the Maghreb escaped his authority. Legacy The kingdom did not last long: in accordance with the strict rules of Sufrites, Abu Qurra would not allow his descendants to found a dynasty. He welcomed Idris I, recognizing his kingdom and breaking with the Rustamids. Idris I negotiated the surrender of Tlemcen with the Maghrawa. One of his descendants, Muhammed Sulayman, established the \\"Sulaymanid kingdom\\" in the region, a state that dominated the cities and lasted until the time of the Fatimids in 931.. Tlemcen became a distinguished city, growing in connection with the Sunni Arab culture of Al-Andalus; in the countryside however, the Ifranides retained their heterodox faith. In 955 their leader revolted against the Fatimids.

He served as the third Kapitein der Chinezen (or Chinese headman) of Batavia from 1645 to 1663, succeeding Kapitein Lim Lak Ko (). Appointment as Kapitein der Chinezen Cornelis van der Lijn, Governor-General at the start of Phoa's tenure. According to the historian Phoa Kian Sioe, the impetus for Phoa Beng Gan's appointment as Kapitein der Chinezen in 1645 came from the local Chinese community of Batavia. Only then was this appointment subsequently approved by Cornelis van der Lijn, the 10th Governor-General under the Dutch East India Company. Unlike his two predecessors, Kapitein Souw Beng Kong and Kapitein Lim Lak Ko, who were both wealthy merchant-mandarins, Phoa did not come from great wealth. As wealth was seen as an essential requirement for public office, the colonial authorities farmed out to Phoa the highly lucrative pacht or tax farm for surat konde or poll tax. This tax was imposed upon the Company's Chinese subjects over the age of sixteen, and was payable to the colonial authorities through the new Kapitein who was entitled to a portion of the total amount. The tax was seen as onerous by the local Chinese community and, for a time, generated a great deal of ill will towards their chosen headman. Irrigation work Phoa's Molenvliet canal in the late 19th century (Woodbury & Page). Despite initial community ill will, Kapitein Phoa Beng Gan acquitted himself well as Chinese headman thanks to his irrigation work, for which he is best remembered today. Batavia in the mid-seventeenth century was prone to severe malaria outbreaks due to its surrounding swamps. The colonial authorities, however, did not have the necessary funds to drain the swamps due to expenditure elsewhere. Kapitein Phoa Beng Gan organised for funds to be collected from the Chinese community to finance the draining of Batavia's swamps, and took charge of the project himself. To this end, he constructed a great canal to drain swamp water out of the city. Draining and construction work on the canal began in January 1648 and were completed by the end of the year. The new canal not only drained the swamps around Batavia, but also served a vital economic role. It connected the city to the then agricultural area of Tanah Abang and beyond, and therefore functioned as a major transportation channel to supply the colonial capital with food produce and other resources from the hinterland. The canal was called Bingamvaart in honour of Kapitein Phoa Beng Gan. Later in 1661, the canal was rechristened Molenvliet - a name it was to retain until Independence. Further irrigation work was needed, however, as the new canal dried up during the dry season, thus preventing its use as a transportation route. The Kapitein remedied this problem by extending the canal, through to what are now Jalan Djuanda and Jalan Veteran in Sawah Besar, in order to connect it to the Ciliwung river. In recognition of the Kapitein's irrigation work, the colonial authorities granted him an estate (particuliere land) in Tanah Abang, where Phoa later cultivated sugar cane.

He made his List A debut for Cricket Australia XI in the 2017‚Äì18 JLT One-Day Cup on 27 September 2017. Early life Bryant was born in Murwillumbah and raised 15km south of the Queensland-New South Wales border in Kingscliff. He grew up playing cricket and rugby league for Cudgen in the Gold Coast competition. Due to its close proximity and population difference, most sports teams based in the north-eastern Tweed region of New South Wales fall under the jurisdiction of neighbouring Gold Coast sporting administrations. State representation differs between sports and this was evidenced when Bryant played for New South Wales in rugby league and Queensland in cricket. At the age of seven, he moved to Townsville for three years before relocating to the Gold Coast. Upon return, Bryant began playing Queensland Premier Cricket for the Gold Coast Dolphins and attended St Joseph's College throughout his teenage years. He continued to play rugby league as a teenager and was offered a three-year developmental contract with the Gold Coast Titans but gave the sport away at the age of 17 to focus on cricket. Domestic career Bryant was in the Cricket Australia XI squad for the 2017‚Äì18 JLT One-Day Cup. He made his List A debut in Cricket Australia XI's victory over South Australia, but he only scored one run and did not bowl. He played again in their second match, top- scoring for the side with 60 runs against Queensland in a losing effort. He registered his highest score for the tournament against New South Wales, reaching 89 runs off just 61 balls, also in a loss. His form was good enough that he did not miss a match for Cricket Australia XI and finished the tournament with a total of 168 runs with a strike rate over 100.

Nielsen filled in as a wicket-keeper in a tour match for South Africa against Cricket Australia XI in 2016, replacing South African wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock when he was ruled out with a viral infection. During the 2017‚Äì18 season he made his debuts in all three major forms of the game, first-class, one-day and Twenty20 cricket playing for Cricket Australia XI in the JLT One-Day Cup and tour matches, the Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League and South Australia in the Sheffield Shield. Domestic career Early career Nielsen started his career playing grade cricket for Woodville Cricket Club in Adelaide. He played his first against a higher quality opposition when he played for a Cricket Australia XI against the touring India national cricket team. Despite his team's poor performance he scored 43 runs off 40 balls and was part of a 52-run partnership for the final wicket. His next major appearance was in another tour match, this time when South Africa were touring Australia, but instead of playing against the South Africans he played with them. When South Africa's wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock was unable to field and their reserve keeper had not yet arrived in the country, Nielsen had to leave partway through a grade cricket match for Woodville to stand in as their wicket- keeper. This gave him the opportunity to keep to a world-class bowling attack. Nielsen started to play for South Australia in the Futures League. When he was the state's leading run-scorer in the competition for the 2016‚Äì17 season, he was upgraded to a senior contract with South Australia for the 2017‚Äì18 season. 2017‚Äì18 season Nielsen was in the Cricket Australia XI squad for the 2017‚Äì18 JLT One-Day Cup and played for them in all six matches, one of their standout players in the tournament. He made his List A debut for Cricket Australia XI in the first match of the tournament against South Australia. He took three catches as Cricket Australia XI's wicket-keeper in what was just the team's second win in their history. He made his first mark with the bat against Victoria, when he came to the crease with Cricket Australia XI at 4/36. They lost two more wickets quickly to fall to 6/45, but Nielsen fought hard and scored 94 runs, falling just short of a century, taking them to 9/216. They lost the match by 7 wickets. He finished the tournament with the highest batting average among the team, scoring 147 runs at an average of 49.00. As their keeper he also had nine dismissals. In November 2017 he also made his first-class debut for Cricket Australia XI in a tour match against England. During the 2017‚Äì18 Big Bash League season, Nielsen was added to the Adelaide Strikers squad for their semi-final match in order to replace their regular wicket-keeper Alex Carey, who was busy playing for Australia's national team at the time. He was taken out of the team for the BBL final when Carey was surprisingly released from his national duty. Nielsen made his Sheffield Shield debut for South Australia a week later when Carey was again called up for national duties. His father Tim Nielsen, who had also kept wickets for South Australia, presented him with his cap. He scored a century in the first innings of the match, becoming the ninth South Australian to do so on Sheffield Shield debut, with his 105 bringing South Australia back into the game after they'd slid to 5/126.

He showed his best form as a two-year-old in 1996 when he won two of his three races including a 20/1 upset victory in the Phoenix Stakes. After being transferred to Godolphin he was off the racecourse for four years before finishing unplaced in five starts in the United Arab Emirates. Background Mantovani was a bay horse bred in Ireland by F Salhoub. He entered the ownership of Jackie Bolger in partnership with John Corcoran and was sent into training with Jim Bolger at Coolcullen, County Carlow. He was probably the best horse sired by Treasure Kay, a sprinter who recorded his biggest win in the 1987 Temple Stakes. Mantovani's dam Dream of Spring was an unraced mare, but was descended from Legendra (foaled 1944) who was the female-line ancestor of Shareef Dancer and Zenyatta. Racing career 1996: two-year-old season Mantovani made his racecourse debut on 12 June in a minor race over six furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in which he started at odds of 11/4 and finished second of the seven runners, beaten a short head by the Kevin Prendergast-trained favourite Quws. On 6 July the colt started 4/7 favourite for a maiden race over the same course and distance. Ridden as on his debut by Kevin Manning, he recorded his first success as he won by three quarters of a length from the filly Maratana. Despite suffering from sore shins which disrupted his training, Mantovani was then moved up sharply in class and started a 20/1 outsider for the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes on 11 August. The Coventry Stakes winner Verglas started favourite, while the other seven runners included Ocean Ridge (Prix Robert Papin), Azra (Silver Flash Stakes) and Raphane (Curragh Stakes). Manning was aboard Azra, the Bolger stable's more fancied runner, and so the ride on Mantovani went to Conor Everard. After racing just behind the leaders Mantovani \\"squeezed\\" though a gap along the inside rail a furlong out, took the lead and kept on well to win by two lengths from the British challenger Muchea. Jim Bolger commented I knew he would handle the ground. I had planned to run him in the Anglesea Stakes but plans will now have to be changed\\". In the autumn of 1996 Mantovani was bought privately by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and was transferred to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. Later career In the winter of 1996/97 Mantovani was sent to be trained at Godolphin's base in the United Arab Emirates. He appears to have had serious training problems and missed the next four seasons before finally returning to the track as a six-year-old in 2000. He ran twice in that year, finishing unplaced in two handicap races in December at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse and Jebel Ali. On 25 January 2001 Mantovani finished fifth of the ten runners behind March Crusader in a handicap race over 1500 metres at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse. In the following month he finished fourth in a handicap over 1400 metres at Ghantoot Racecourse. On his final start he finished sixth at Nad Al Sheba in April.

Right after Rwanda's brutal civil war and the genocide that followed, approximately 650 UK crew from 5 Brigade accompanied the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda (UNAMIR) as a division of Operation GABRIEL. On July 30 1994, five days after getting ready in Aldershoot, the advance elements of the contingent, led by the CO 5 Airborne Brigade Logistic Battalion entered the Kigali airports on the fringes of the capital. They arrived after 100 days of battle and murder which took the lives of approximately one million men, women, and children. 23 Parachute Field Ambulance RAMC swiftly set up primary health clinics for the helpless refugees and fortified the country's three operating hospitals with environmental health teams and surgical teams to stop the expansion of disease inside the filthy and horrid refugee camps. After being stationed in the North of Rwanda for a month, 23 PFA were re-deployed by the Force Commander, Canadian Major General Romeo Dallaire, to stop the unpredicted mass evacuation of refugees into Zaire, located at the Southern end of Lake Kivu. 23 PFA came to the aid of over 125,000 civilians over the 4-month deployment. Rwanda had a sensible framework for that area in Africa, but was destroyed after the conflict. The sappers of 9 Parachute Squadron RE labored to enhance and preserve crucial road routes and give sufficient sanitary arrangements for the distant refugee camps. Devising construction materials, they restored village clinics, re- connected power supplies to towns and replaced various strategic river crossings ruined in earlier conflict. This was all to motivate the refugees to come back from camps where their lives were in danger. The instantaneous and widespread administration of aid was facilitated by 63 Airborne Close Support Squadron RLC. Soldiers deployed to remote locations carrying 1,500 tonnes of aid and moving 20,000 refugees in their brief time in theatre. The war and roads had depleted much of the UN's fleet of utility, armored, and transport vehicles and equipment, which had been left behind all across Rwanda. Infantry protection was given by A Company 2nd Battalion The Princess of Wales Royal Regiment over the course of deployment. Additional Contingent Units consisted of detachment from 30 Signal Regiment, 29 Movement Control Regiment, 49 Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), RE, 9 Supply Regiment, 160 Provost Company and the Specialist Team Royal Engineers (STRE). 5 Airborne Brigade's service in Operation Gabriel lasted until November 1994, when it was removed.

Besant and C. W. Leadbeater. It was originally published in 1901 in London. From the standpoint of Theosophy, it tells regarding visualization of thoughts, experiences, emotions and music. Drawings of the \\"thought-forms\\" were performed by John Varley Jr. (grandson of the painter John Varley), Prince, and McFarlane.  From history of compilation  This book has become the result of the joint work of the authors, which began in 1895, when they had started an investigation of \\"the subtle matter of the universe.\\" They were interested in the work of the human mind as, according to their claim, this work \\"extrudes into the external world\\" the thought-forms. In September 1896, Besant reported in Lucifer that \\"two clairvoyant Theosophists\\" (whose personalities were not disclosed in the journal, although some members of the Society knew about them) had started \\"observing the substance of thought.\\" Her article named Thought-Forms was accompanied by four pages of pictures of diverse thought- forms which the investigators \\"had observed and described to an artist.\\" The colour sketches of the unknown performance were depicting: on the first plate‚Äîthought-forms of \\"devotion,\\" \\"sacrifice,\\" and \\"devotional,\\" on the second one‚Äîthree types of \\"anger,\\" on the third one‚Äîthree types of \\"love\\" (\\"undirected,\\" \\"directed,\\" and \\"grasping\\"), and on the fourth one‚Äîthought- forms of \\"jealousy,\\" \\"intellect,\\" and \\"ambition.\\" Besant gave the article scientific coloring, not forgetting to mention R√∂ntgen, Baraduc, Reichenbach, \\"vibrations and the ether.\\" This \\"small but influential book\\", which contains color pictures of thought-forms that the authors said are created \\"in subtle spirit-matter,\\" was published in 1901. The book affirms that \\"the quality\\" of thoughts influences the life experience of their creator, and that they \\"can affect\\" other people.  Basic concepts   Meaning of color  Frontispiece. The meanings of colours. The authors write that they, like many theosophists, are convinced that \\"thoughts are things,\\" and the task of their book is to help the reader understand this. The frontispiece of the book contains a table \\"The meanings of colours\\" of thought-forms and human aura associated with feelings and emotions, beginning with \\"High Spirituality\\" (light blue‚Äîin the upper left corner) and ending by \\"Malice\\" (black‚Äîin the lower right corner), 25 colors in all. The authors argue that human aura is \\"the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his higher bodies, interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body.\\" The mental and desire bodies (two human higher bodies) are \\"those chiefly concerned with the appearance of what are called thought-forms.\\"  Three principles and three classes  The book states that \\"the production of all thought-forms\\" is based on three major principles: > # Quality of thought determines colour. # Nature of thought determines form. > # Definiteness of thought determines clearness of outline. The authors define the following three classes of thought-forms: > # That which takes the image of the thinker. When a man thinks of himself as > in some distant place, or wishes earnestly to be in that place, he makes a > thought-form in his own image which appears there. # That which takes the > image of some material object. [The painter who forms a conception of his > future picture builds it up out of the matter of his mental body, and then > projects it into space in front of him, keeps it before his mind's eye, and > copies it. The novelist in the same way builds images of his character in > mental matter, and by the exercise of his will moves these puppets from one > position or grouping to another, so that the plot of his story is literally > acted out before him.] # That which takes a form entirely its own, > expressing its inherent qualities in the matter which it draws round it. > [Those of which we here give specimens are almost wholly of that class.]  Examples of thought-forms  Fig. 16. Self-Renunciation. \\"To paint in earth's dull colours the forms clothed in the living light of other worlds, ‚Äî Besant writes in the foreword, ‚Äî is a hard and thankless task.\\" The authors claim that the images in the book \\"are not imaginary forms, prepared as some dreamer thinks that they ought to appear.\\" Rather, \\"they are representations of forms actually observed as thrown off by ordinary men and women.\\" And the authors sincerely hope that they will force the reader \\"realise the nature and power of his thoughts, acting as a stimulus to the noble, a curb on the base.\\"  Created by emotions  Fig. 13.

The authors write that a form in Fig. 19 at the top is a specific thought-form which had accompanied a question demonstrating deep thought and penetration. The first variant of the answer did not fully satisfy the questioner, and his desire to achieve a full and comprehensive answer was expressed in the fact that his \\"thought-form deepened in colour and changed into the second of the two shapes (in Fig. 19 below), resembling a corkscrew even more closely than before.\\" Fig. 22, 23. Murderous Rage and Sustained Anger. Fig. 22 and 23 are thought-forms of a \\"murderous rage\\" (on the right) and a \\"sustained anger\\" (on the left). The first form was taken \\"from the aura of a rough and partially intoxicated man in the East End of London,\\" when he was knocking down a woman; a flare flashed in her direction, triggering an explosion of horror‚Äîshe recognized that one would be struck. In the same illustration drawn a \\"stiletto-like dart\\" directed to the lower left corner: it is a thought \\"of steady anger, intense and desiring vengeance, of the quality of murder, sustained through years, and directed against a person who had inflicted a deep injury on the one who sent it forth.\\" Fig. 27. Sudden Fright. Fig. 29. Greed for Drink. The authors state that when a person is suddenly frightened, then has a place the effect shown in Fig. 27. It is emphasized that \\"all the crescents\\" on the right, which apparently have been emitted earlier than others, do not show anything other than \\"the livid grey of fear; but a moment later the man is already partially recovering from the shock, and beginning to feel angry that he allowed himself to be startled.\\" The later crescents have changed to scarlet, and it evidences the \\"mingling of anger and fear,\\" while the last crescent is quite scarlet, and it shows that \\"already the fright is entirely overcome, and only the annoyance remains.\\"  Created by experiences  Beginning from Fig. 30, \\"the book changes course in an interesting way,\\" moving from the illustrations of individual thoughts and emotions to the narrative of events. Besant and Leadbeater write that occasioned by a \\"terrible accident\\" at sea, three thought-forms depicted in Fig. 30 \\"were seen simultaneously, arranged exactly as represented, though in the midst of indescribable confusion.\\" The authors continue: > \\"They are instructive as showing how differently people are affected by > sudden and serious danger. One form [on the right] shows nothing but an > eruption of the livid grey of fear, rising out of a basis of utter > selfishness: and unfortunately there were many such as this. The shattered > appearance of the thought-form shows the violence and completeness of the > explosion, which in turn indicates that the whole soul of that person was > possessed with blind, frantic terror, and that the overpowering sense of > personal danger excluded for the time every higher feeling.\\" Fig. 30. At a Shipwreck. The authors explain that the thought-form in Fig. 30 on the left shows an attempt to find \\"solace in prayer,\\" and in this way overcome fear. This can be seen under a grayish-blue color, \\"which lifts itself hesitatingly upwards.\\" Yet it is seen that judging by \\"the lower part of the thought-form, with its irregular outline and its falling fragments, that there is in reality almost as much fright here\\" as in the case on the right. Thus, one person has a chance to restore \\"self-control,\\" while the other remains \\"an abject slave to overwhelming emotion.\\" The thought-form at upper has been created by a member of the ship crew responsible for the lives of passengers, and it demonstrates a \\"very striking contrast\\" of the weakness manifesting in two forms from below. Herein shown \\"a powerful, clear-cut and definite thought, obviously full\\" of energy and determination. Orange color speaks of his confidence in ability to manage with the difficulty. The \\"brilliant yellow\\" means that his intellect is already at work upon the problem. Fig. 31. On the First Night. Fig. 31 is another declarative piece, depicting \\"the thought-form of an actor while waiting to go upon the stage.\\" The authors expound that the orange band indicates self-confidence, > \\"yet in spite of this there is a good deal of unavoidable uncertainty as to > how this new play may strike the fickle public, and on the whole the doubt > and fear overbalance the certainty and pride, for there is more of the pale > grey than of the orange, and the whole thought-form vibrates like a flag > flapping in a gale of wind.\\" Fig. 34. At a Funeral. In the thought-form on the left in Fig. 34, as the authors explain, there is nothing but \\"the highest and most beautiful\\" feelings. At the base of the thought-form, you can see \\"a full expression of deep sympathy,\\" the light green color shows the understanding of the suffering of the deceased's relatives and condolence with them, and the strip \\"of deeper green shows the attitude of the thinker towards the dead man himself.\\" The dense rose-color shows love to both the deceased and the surrounding, while the upper part, consisting of a cone and stars above it, indicates a feeling in connection with thoughts of death: the blue express \\"its devotional aspect,\\" while as \\"the violet shows the thought of, and the power to respond to, a noble ideal\\" and the ability to match, the stars reflect \\"the spiritual aspirations.\\" In the same figure, the thought-form on the right reflects nothing but only \\"profound depression, fear and selfishness.\\" His only definite feelings are despair and the sense of his personal loss, and these show themselves in proper strips of brown-grey and leaden grey color, while the \\"very curious downward protrusion\\" demonstrates the strong selfish desire to raise the dead man into his earth life.  Created by meditation  Fig. 38. An Aspiration to Enfold all. The description of the event depicted in the book on Fig. 38, as noted a historian Breen, \\"anticipates the 1960s\\" as well with its conjunction of meditation and idealism: this thought-form was \\"generated by one who was trying, while sitting in meditation, to fill his mind with an aspiration to enfold all mankind in order to draw them upward towards the high ideal which shone so clearly before his eyes.\\" The ability of the authors to see the \\"vibrations of ideas, emotions, and sounds\\" demonstrates, in his opinion, \\"a sort of spiritual synesthesia\\" which transform the religious act into a neurological phenomenon. Fig. 41. The Logos as manifested in Man. The authors write that the thought-form shown in Fig. 41 was accompanied by \\"the devotional aspiration\\" to that Logos may thus be manifested through the man in meditation. It is this religious feeling gives a \\"pale blue\\" shade to the five-pointed star. This form has been used \\"for many ages as a symbol of God manifest in man.\\"  Created by music  Plate M. \\"Seeing\\" of music: No. 9 from the Songs Without Words by Mendelssohn. Plate M showing the form created by music of Mendelssohn \\"depicts yellow, red, blue and green lines rising out of a church.\\" This, as the authors explain, \\"signifies the movement of one of the parts of the melody, the four moving approximately together denoting the treble, alto, tenor and bass respectively.\\" Moreover, \\"the scalloped edging surrounding the whole is the result of various flourishes and arpeggios, and the floating crescents in the centre represent isolated or staccato chords.\\" On Plate G depicts a musical form to the piece by Gounod. Describing a musical form \\"created\\" by Wagner (on Plate W), the authors note in it the likeness to the \\"successively retreating\\" ramparts of a mountain, \\"and it is heightened by the billowy masses of cloud which roll between the crags and give the effect of perspective.\\"  Thought- Forms and modern art  Meistersingers by Wagner. According to professor Ellwood, the book by Besant and Leadbeater had a large influence on modern art. \\"It suggested, to a world moving rapidly beyond the literalism of Victorian art, the expression in painting of surreal forms and forces underlying, but different from, the visible world.\\" Thought-Forms demonstrated how the symbolism of \\"astral colors and forms\\" can express the specificity of \\"certain soul's and mental states.\\" It had a great influence on Kandinsky as one of the essential factors that led to the \\"genius opening of new perspectives for painting.\\" According to reminiscences by Sabaneyev, besides The Secret Doctrine Scriabin interested a magazine Vestnik Theosofii, which published [from 1908] the translations of Besant and Leadbeater's works. Apparently, being impressed by theirs theosophical works, he once said that \\"strong, powerful thought creates a thought-form so intense that it, in addition to the will, flows into the consciousness of other people.\\" The perform of the part of light in Prometheus he imagined in the form of a radiance of some \\"luminous matter,\\" which was supposed to fill the hall. A historian Breen wrote that Besant and Leadbeater were well aware how annoying stuff may be their book for a \\"society that remained deeply conservative\\". In early January 1901, when this book was published, \\"Queen Victoria still ruled England. 'Modernism' as a movement or even a concept did not exist. When we consider this world of 1901, ‚Äì further wrote Breen, ‚Äì it becomes difficult not to believe that Besant, Leadbeater and their milieu deserve a more prominent place in the annals of both abstract art and the history of modernism\\". As the art critic Kramer has pointed, \\"what is particularly striking about the outlook of the artists primarily responsible for creating abstraction is their espousal of occult doctrine.\\" Yeats, Eliot, Malevich, Kandinsky, and Mondrian were charmed by Theosophy. In the first decades of the twentieth century, it was a widespread \\"component of Western cultural life\\". Thus, Besant and Ledbetter had played, summed up Breen, \\"a small but intriguing role in shaping the globalized culture... which weaves together East and West, mysticism and rationalism, sound and sight.\\"  Criticism  An academic science names the activities of such \\"investigators,\\" as the authors of this book, \\"pseudoscience\\", because it is based on a concept of the extrasensory perception. The belief in existence of thought-forms \\"remains influential today\\" for the Theosophists, followers of New Thought, New Age and in neopagan movements, including Wicca.  New editions and translations  After its first publication in 1901 the book was reprinted several times (8th ‚Äì in 1971). This work has been translated into several European languages: French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish.

In 2017, the species type Choconsaurus baileywillisi was named and described by Edith Sim√≥n, Leonardo Salgado and Jorge Orlando Calvo. The genus name refers to its discovery in El Choc√≥n. For its part, the name of the species is in homage to the American geologist Bailey Willis, who traced the stratigraphy of the area between 1910 and 1914. The holotype specimen was found in a layer of the Huincul Formation dating to the end of the Cenomanian epoch. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking a skull. The vertebrae of the neck, back and tail and parts of the limbs were preserved. This constitutes the most complete skeleton known of a basal titanosaur in 2017. The describing authors have identified some distinctive features. In the cervical vertebrae, the upper edge of the face of the posterior joint was hardly developed. In the first vertebrae there are very large secondary protuberances on both sides of the hyposphene. The central and posterior vertebrae have an additional crest located between the posterior crest that extends from the lateral protrusion to the vertebral body and the secondary crest running parallel to the main crest. The frontal vertebrae of the tail have a protrusion in the posterior hyposphenic secondary joint. Choconsaurus was classified in its description article of 2017 within the clade Titanosauria in a basal position, outside the clade Eutitanosauria.

History Mallen was born at Euston Square, London, and was apprenticed to the Edwards company, cabinetmakers to the Royal Family, where his father and brother were employed all their lives. He and his family emigrated to South Australia aboard the steamer Champion in December 1854, and for a time was employed at his trade, producing ornamental work for the Wesleyan Church, Pirie street, and Faulding's chemist shop. He purchased some land in Angas Street and five acres at Clapham, where he built a home. He then worked for Mellor Brothers, agricultural machinists, and while with them was given a job to repair a malt crusher at W. H. Clark's brewery on Halifax Street. Clark then moved to the West End Brewery, Hindley Street, which ultimately became the property of John Haimes, and Mallen was kept busy making plant and connecting machinery for the new brewery. Then W. K. Simms purchased the business, and put Mallen on the permanent staff. Next Edgar Chapman joined the business as Simms & Chapman, and Mallen was appointed brewer and manager. In 1874 they sent him to New South Wales to select a location for a new brewery. He settled on the town of Waverley, near Sydney, and there on Edgecliffe Road built the \\"Adelaide Brewery\\", where he brewed the first beer in December 1874, and was very successful, and in 1875 enlarged the cellars. Mallen left the company after being refused a partnership in the firm, and returned to Adelaide, where he purchased land on West Terrace, and built a small brewery on the Gilbert Street corner, which he (cheekily?) named \\"Waverley Brewery\\", which started operation in December 1875, and was purchased by Simms in 1876, to become Waverley Vinegar Works. He then purchased a property on Unley Road, Lower Mitcham, near the Brownhill Creek, Until proven otherwise, believed to be on Belair Road between Princes Road and Newark Road. and in 1878 in conjunction with Haimes built the \\"Waverley Brewery\\", operated by Haimes, Mallen & Co., which consisted of John Haimes, Mallen, his daughter Maria M. Mallen, and Arthur Bean, who retired in 1879. \\"Waverley Brewery\\" ceased operation in the 1930s, but the Mallen family continued as hotel operators well into the late 20th century.

In 1634 he took over the position of master of the children of the cathedral, succeeding Artus Aux-Cousteaux, who himself had succeeded Jean de Bournonville.

In 1646, when he had two masses published by Robert III Ballard, he is said to be a canon of the church of St. Firmin d'Amiens and master of the children of the cathedral church of that city.

He was also called Maung Aung, or \\"Master Victory\\". He supposedly lived to be around 200 years of age. He is credited with creating the modern wiezza movement when he discovered manuscripts revealing the secrets of weizzas and mastered the art of qin. \\"Bo Bo\\" is a common Burmese honorific which translates to \\"uncle\\". Early life Childhood Aung's exact birthdate is unknown, though he was a classmate of the future King Bodawpaya, who was born in the Burmese era 1106, as well as of the future Taungpila Sayadaw., Aung's name at birth was Pho Aung. His father was Pho Myat San and his mother was Mae Nyein Yar. Due to his parent's lack of financial resources, Aung was malnourished as a child. Consequently, he suffered from skin disease and was taunted by his peers, who called him \\"Maung Wei\\". \\"Maung\\" means \\"teenage boy\\" and \\"wei\\" being a Burmese word for scabies. The Sayadaw's dream One day, while the Kye Ni Sayadaw was having a nap, he dreamed that he was woken by a holy man dressed in white. In the dream, the man in white led him to the lake at the back of the monastery, gestured to a specific area of the lake, then disappeared. When the Sayadaw awoke, he felt as if the dream were real. Days later, he was thinking about his dream and went out to the lake to look again at the spot the white robed man pointed to. When he reached the edge of the lake he felt something in the water under a tree. It was a copper manuscript. He washed it off and took it to the monastery. The dirty pillow Not long after this, the Sayadaw passed away. He was cremated and his remains were entombed and his three main disciples began to divide his possessions. The new Sayadaw jokingly threw an old pillow to Aung, and told him that that was his inheritance from the former Sayadaw. Out of respect, Aung accepted it. He used it to balance his elbow while he wrote on the floor. The pillow eventually began to tear and he saw that there was something hard inside the pillow. Later, he overheard some wise men discussing the lost copper manuscript of the former Sayardaw. Attempted assassination Statue of Bo Bo Aung When Aung became a powerful weizza, his old classmate, King Bodawpaya attempted to have him assassinated because he refused to acknowledge him as the future Buddha., First, he sent a team of soldiers to find Aung. The soldiers begged him to return with them, saying that they would be killed if they failed the king. Aung ordered the soldiers to send a report to the king that they had captured him and put him in chains at the bottom of their boat. He promised them that he would appear in the boat when it arrived at the capital. The soldiers did as he said. When their boat reached the capital two weeks later, they found Aung lying at the bottom of the boat tied in chains. King Bodawpaya gathered his people to witness the execution. He ordered the executioners to throw Aung into a deep ditch and buried him alive. Later that evening, when Bodawpaya was meeting with his ministers, Bo Bo Aung appeared. He told the king that he was a false friends and reminded him that they had sworn eternal friendship to each other. He told him that he did not want to take over his kingdom. He wrote a circle in chalk on the palace floor and presented a challenge to the king. He told the king to erase the chalk drawing from the floor. The King, full of shame and anger, rubbed out the circle but then two more appeared. He continued to try to erase the chalk circles until the whole palace floor was covered with hundreds of them. Aung again chided the king, who begged him to protect his family. Aung vowed to do that and then vanished. Legacy Many Burmese Buddhists believe that Aung never died, but remains on earth to wait for the coming of the next Buddha and protect the Dharma. They believe that he is available to help pious laypeople in their daily struggles. He is often accompanied by a statue of Bo Min Gaung, another prominent weizzas, on Buddhist altars in Myanmar., The Freedom Movement In the first half of the twentieth century, many Burmese associated Aung with the Freedom Movement against British colonization. The movement sought to draw on his mystical weizzas powers. Bogyoke Aung San (the father of Aung San Suu Kyi) was considered to have been the reincarnation of Aung.

It was built in about 1642 during the English Civil War. Largely reconstructed in the 19th century, it has been a Grade II listed building since 1949.Chudleigh Fort: A Grade II Listed Building in Bideford, Devon - English Heritage Listed Buildings websiteChudleigh Fort - Heritage Gateway website Civil War period The interior of Chudleigh Fort Because of the prejudice of Charles I against the merchant classes by imposing, for example, a ship money tax, the important mercantile port of Bideford did not support the king during the Civil War, siding instead with Parliament. The important Devon landowner Sir George Chudleigh and his son James Chudleigh, the latter having served as an officer in the Royalist army in Ireland, sided with the Parliamentarian forces based at the garrison in Barnstaple, which also covered nearby Bideford. Some time after August 1642 James Chudleigh built a pair of 8-gun earthwork artillery forts to guard Bideford, strategically positioning them on the high ground overlooking both sides of the River Torridge, one at East-the-Water and the other at West-the- Water, thus preventing the river's use by Royalist ships. By the Summer of 1643 the Royalists, under Sir Ralph Hopton, had made major gains in the South West, having won victories at the Battle of Braddock Down (January 1643) and Stratton (May 1643), causing the Parliamentary forces to retreat into Bideford where they were then besieged. After more Royalist victories at Lansdown (July 1643) and Roundway Down (July 1643) it became clear that Bideford would not be relieved and in August 1643 it was stormed by Royalist forces under Colonel Digby. Following fierce fighting around the two forts the town fell. James Chudleigh was not in Bideford during the siege having been captured during the fighting at Stratton and imprisoned at Oxford. After his incarceration he and his father and brother defected to the Royalists. Modern times The War Memorial in the park At the end of the Civil War the fort was abandoned but the site was never built on and in the middle of the 19th-century it was rebuilt in stone as a five-sided folly by James Ley from Northam, who gave it 14 gun emplacements instead of the 8 the original fort had. The fort now contains 7 old cannon on wheeled wooden gun-carriages. Ley's fort was never intended to be a genuine fortress because of its thin stone walls and open rear. The plaque on the wall states \\"Fort erected by Major-General Chudleigh. April 1642\\". However, this is an error as the Civil War did not start until August 1642. The site was purchased by public subscription in 1921 for use as a public park in memory of those who died in World War I. At this time the war memorial was built, paths were laid out and the park was landscaped and laid to grass. Later the plaques on the war memorial were altered to commemorate the residents of Bideford who were killed or missing in World War I and World War II. The park is maintained by the Torridge District Council.Chudleigh Fort, Bideford on the Devon County Council website References External links *Chudleigh Fort, Chudleigh Avenue, Bideford, Devon - Historic England website Forts in England Forts in Devon Military history of Devon Folly buildings in England Bideford Buildings and structures in Bideford Sieges of the English Civil Wars Urban public parks Parks and open spaces in Devon Grade II listed buildings in Devon Grade II listed forts ","title":"Chudleigh Fort"},{"id":"55361245","text":"Babacar Dione (born 22 March 1997) is a Belgian footballer who plays for Royal Excel Mouscron in the Belgian First Division A as a Striker.

These included obtaining the rights to perform anatomical dissection on the bodies of prisoners dying in jail, the granting of a Royal Charter by William and Mary in 1695, and the construction of the original Surgeons' Hall, the first permanent home of the Edinburgh Surgeons.

He had the powerful support in this venture of Archibald Pitcairne, who had served as Professor of Physic at Leyden from 1692.

Edinburgh, Sutherland and Knox, 1860 Like his friend Archibald Pitcairne, also an enthusiastic Jacobite, he seems to have had the strength of character to overcome this setback and he was again elected Deacon in 1701.

Charter from William and Mary Monteith was therefore a Deacon at an important time in the history of the Incorporation. In 1694 the Incorporation was granted a new charter by King William and Queen Mary. This confirmed that only certified members of the Incorporation had the rights to practise surgery and pharmacy in south-east Scotland.

History  In 2016, largely in response to the introduction of Australia's mandatory metadata retention scheme, Digital Rights Watch was created at a meeting of representatives from Australian human rights organisations, activists, political advisers, technology consultants and academics. To coordinate a civil society response to the metadata retention scheme as well as other key digital rights violations, a new organisation was founded with the aim of aligning and supporting existing efforts.  Focus  Digital Rights Watch's mission is to ensure that Australian citizens are equipped, empowered and enabled to uphold their digital rights. The organisation works on advocacy, policy reform and public-facing campaigns that push for ethical data use by corporations, good digital government practices and policies, a rights-based legal system, and empowered and informed citizens.  Structure  Digital Rights Watch is an incorporated Association, registered as a national charity with the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission. It is a member-run organisation, with a board of directors elected once a year at its Annual General Meeting. The organisation also operates an Advisory Council, which informs and advises on policy and strategy. Digital Rights Watch is a member of the CIVICUS World Alliance for Citizen Participation, the Australian Digital Inclusion Alliance, and the global Keep It On campaign. In October 2017, Digital Rights Watch's Chair Tim Singleton Norton received a special mention in the Access Now Global Heroes and Villains of Human Rights Awards. Digital Rights Watch often works in partnerships with other Australian digital or human rights organisations such as the Human Rights Law Centre, Amnesty International Australia, Electronic Frontiers Australia, the Australian Privacy Foundation, ACFID and others. Digital Rights Watch also works with international groups such as Access Now, Electronic Frontiers Foundation, Open Media, EDRi, Privacy International and others.  Campaigns  In August 2016, Digital Rights Watch coordinated a campaign, including media coverage, expressing concern over privacy issues raised in the Australian national census. On 13 April 2017, Digital Rights Watch declared a national day of action against mandatory data retention, calling for all Australians to 'Get a VPN'. In August 2017, Digital Rights Watch hosted an event as part of the Melbourne Writers Festival in which they profiled the personal metadata footprint of Professor Gillian Triggs, former President of the Australian Human Rights Commission. In September 2017, Digital Rights Watch partnered with Privacy International to push for greater transparency over intelligence sharing operations between governments. In May 2018, Digital Rights Watch launched the State of Digital Rights report, outlining several ways that Australian citizen's digital rights are being eroded. Between October and December 2018, Digital Rights Watch coordinated a public campaign The Alliance for a Safe and Secure Internet against proposed legislation that gave increased powers to law enforcement to break encryption protocols. In May 2019, Digital Rights Watch partnered with Electronic Frontiers Australia to launch the Save Australian Technology campaign.

The museum shares space with the Museum of Pasta (in Italian della pasta). History In 2001, the Comitato Promotore dei Musei del Cibo (literally the Promoting Committee of Food Museums) was founded. Starting 2003 and 2004, it cooperated with the Association of the Food Museums of the Province of Parma, that had brought together the Province of Parma, the Communes of Soragna, Langhirano and Collecchio, a consortium of protectionists of typical food products, the Chamber of Commerce of Parma and various economic associations, all interested in the creation and management of a network of Food Museums in the province of Parma. This resulted in launching of an initiative to establish a museum in Corte di Giarola, a public building, and a great medieval rural court, as a museum dedicated to the tomato. It shares space with an adjoining Museum of Pasta (in Italian Museo della pasta). Opening The Tomato Museum is located on the ground floor of the west wing of Corte di Giarola that was renovated.

The operation was the first offensive by the new French Republic in the Mediterranean during the conflict, and was directed at the island of Sardinia, part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Sardinia was neutral at the time, but immediately joined the anti-French coalition. The operation was a total failure, with attacks directed at Cagliari in the southTommaso Napoli, Relazione di quanto √® avvenuto dalla comparsa della flotta francese in Cagliari sino alla totale ritirata di essa nel 1793/94 and La Maddalena in the northLa Maddalena, 22/25 February 1793, Military Subjects both ending in defeat. The operation was launched by the French Mediterranean Fleet, led by Contre-amiral Laurent Truguet, under instructions from the National Convention. The government had issued orders to invade Sardinia, strategically important to the Mediterranean, which they believed would bring an easy victory. Delays in assembling the invasion force gave the Sardinians sufficient time to raise an army, and when the French fleet arrived off the capital Cagliari, the Sardinians were ready. The first attack was dispersed by a gale, but the second went ahead on 22 January 1793. French troops subsequently landed on 11 February but were driven off in fighting at Quartu Sant'Elena. A subsequent attack on the island of La Maddalena off the northern coast of Sardinia also failed, partly due to deliberate sabotage by Corsican troops; it is most notable as the first military service of the Lieutenant Colonel Napoleon Bonaparte, later Emperor of France. On 25 May a Spanish fleet recaptured the small islands of San Pietro and Sant'Antioco, the last of the French garrisons on Sardinia. The legacies of the campaign included a series of popular revolts in Sardinia against the Savoyard rulers, a temporary breakaway of Corsica from France, and a rebellion at the French naval base of Toulon leading to the capture and near destruction of the entire French Mediterranean Fleet by a British Royal Navy fleet. Background The French Revolutionary Wars began in April 1792 when the Austrian Empire and Kingdom of Prussia declared war on the newly instituted French Republic.Chandler, p.xxiv Although the Kingdom of Sardinia, split between Piedmont in Northern Italy and the large Mediterranean island of Sardinia, was not part of this coalition, it was identified as a primary target of French military operations. The island of Sardinia was agriculturally rich and strategically important in the Mediterranean, and it was felt in France that its capture would intimidate the mainland part of the Kingdom and the other nations of the Italian peninsula, and spread republicanism beyond the borders of France.McLynn, p.58 Moreover, a successful attack on the island was thought to be easily achievable, and orders were given for an expeditionary force to assemble at Toulon, the principal French Mediterranean naval base. Command of this operation was given to Contre-amiral Laurent Truguet, commander of the Mediterranean fleet, who had difficulty raising the necessary troops. France in general and the French navy in particular were undergoing severe social and political upheaval, and it was not until December that a sufficient expeditionary force had been prepared. Truguet and the Mediterranean fleet then sailed with a French army, carried on transports, arriving off the capital of Sardinia, Cagliari on the southern coast, on 21 December 1792. On Sardinia warnings of the impending French attack had arrived months earlier, although the political authority based with King Victor Amadeus III in Turin made little effort to reinforce the island, believing that to do so might be seen by the French as a provocation. The island's inhabitants however were devout Roman Catholics, and the persecution of Catholic clergy in the aftermath of the French Revolution incited considerable opposition among the Sardinian people; the local government, the Stamenti, were able to raise more than 4,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry, although the garrison was very short of artillery.Smyth, p.53 Storm and siege As the French fleet of 36 vessels entered the Golfo di Cagliari, a severe storm struck, driving Truguet's ships off-shore. A number of troop transports were lost and the rest of the fleet was driven to Palmas on the southwestern coast of the island. There Truguet landed troops on the islands of San Pietro and Sant'Antioco, both of which were taken without fighting.Smyth, p.54 He also landed parties on the Sardinian mainland, although they were driven off by Sardinian irregular forces sniping from the hillsides. The Sardinians attributed the storm to St Thomas the Apostle, on whose feast day it occurred. Truguet remained off Palmas for a month, gathering his ships in preparation for another attack. On 22 January he again entered the Golfo di Cagliari, and sent a boat party of an officer and 20 men to demand the Sardinian surrender. The Sardinians, assembled for the feast day of Saint Ephesius, opened fire on the boat as it approached and killed 17 of the party, the survivors sheltering behind a neutral Swedish merchant vessel.Smyth, p.55 Truguet was furious and ordered a heavy bombardment of the town on 25 January. By this point, Truguet had amassed 82 vessels for the invasion, including 41 transports, but his attack proved ineffective; the strength of the shore batteries and their use of heated shot inflicted significant damage to several French ships, which were unable to seriously damage the town. Landing at Quartu Sant'Elena On 11 February a French detachment landed 1,200 soldiers at Quartu Sant'Elena. The troops advanced westwards towards Cagliari but were driven back by Sardinian cavalry. Attacks on the Cagliari lazaretto and a tower at Calamosca were also beaten off, but the French regrouped, landing additional forces until 5,000 French troops were encamped outside Quartu Sant'Elena. The town and Calamosca were attacked again on 15 February, with heavy artillery support from the French fleet, but without success. The force sent against Quartu Sant'Elena was struck by grapeshot fired from improvised barricades and retreated in disarray, while the other attack was defeated by a Sardinian counter-attack. Truguet withdrew his forces to the beachhead, leaving 300 dead and 100 prisoners in Sardinian hands; the victorious Sardinians were said to have dismembered the dead French soldiers and carried their body parts around as trophies.Smyth, p.57 On 16 and 17 February Truguet bombarded Cagliari again, to little effect. On the second day, another storm swept the bay and his fleet was again scattered. Several ships were lost, most notably the 74-gun ship of the line L√©opard, which was driven ashore and wrecked. Truguet then abandoned the entire operation, embarking his soldiers and returning to France. He left 800 men and two frigates to garrison San Pietro and Sant'Antioco. La Maddalena debacle As Truguet sailed impotently off Cagliari, a second French force had been prepared for operations in Northern Sardinia. This force had drawn heavily from Corsica, the French held island to the north which was under the de facto command of Corsican independence advocate Pasquale Paoli.Ireland, p.145 Corsica had been invaded and captured by a French army in 1768, and Paoli was pressing for greater autonomy from France in the aftermath of the Revolution. It was Paoli's plan to launch the Northern attack as a diversion to Truguet's operation off the capital, with the island of La Maddalena, a small, heavily fortified position off the northern coast, as the dedicated target. 450 Corsican volunteers were mustered, with Paoli's nephew Colonna Cesari in command. His second deputy was a Corsican artillery officer and political rival of Paoli, the young head of the powerful Bonaparte family, Napoleon. The force was delayed by storms at Ajaccio, and only reached La Maddalena on 22 February 1793, anchoring in the Santo Stefano channel. Napoleon advocated a night attack, but was overruled by Cesari. The following morning French- Corsican troops assaulted and captured Santo Stefano and used the fort on the island to bombard La Maddalena on 24 February, Cesari announcing his intention to conduct an amphibious landing the following day. During the night however, there was a mutiny reported aboard a corvette accompanying the force and Cesari immediately withdrew, abandoning the attack and Santo Stefano.McLynn, p.59 Napoleon was furious, not least because Cesari did not warn him and he and his men were nearly left behind on Santo Stefano and vulnerable to a Sardinian counter-attack. In the retreat to the landing zone, Napoleon's men were forced to spike and abandon their cannon when insufficient boats were sent to collect them. He later accused Cesari of faking the mutiny on the orders of Paoli.McLynn, p.60 Aftermath The final act of the campaign came three months after both Truguet and Cesari had withdrawn. Truguet's garrison remained on the islands of San Pietro and Sant'Antioco on the western side of Sardinia until 25 May. That month, a Spanish fleet of 23 ships under Admiral Juan de L√°ngara sailed from Cartagena, and arrived off the islands. The Spanish had gone to war with France in March 1793, and against such an overwhelming force the entire garrison surrendered. Of the frigates, Hel√®ne, was captured in an attempt to escape the Spanish blockade, while Richmond was set on fire and scuttled by the crew to prevent its capture. Although the operation had ended in complete failure it had a number of repercussions. On Sardinia the robust defence of the island encouraged the Stamenti to seek concessions from the distant central government in Turin, following an open invitation from Victor Amadeus.Smyth, p.59 A list of demands for greater autonomy by the Sardinian Stamenti was presented to the king by a deputation from the island, but shortly afterwards a flat refusal of all points was proclaimed by both the king and the Viceroy Carlo Balbiano. The Sardinian people were furious and calls for civil unrest spread through the island.Smyth, p.60 In April 1794 the viceroy arrested two leaders of the growing insurrection, causing a riot in which the Castle of San Michele was stormed and the prisoners released. In the aftermath Victor Amadeus was forced to make concessions to the Sardinians, although violence continued until 1796. Two years later the new king Charles Emmanuel IV, was forced to flee to the island following the outbreak of the War of the Second Coalition.Smyth, p.62 On Corsica the recriminations which followed the failure at La Maddalena saw the Buonaparte faction driven from the island, Napoleon narrowly escaping an assassination attempt. Efforts by the National Convention to hold Paoli to account for the actions of his supporters in the operation led to a break down in the relationship between Paoli and the French government and a large scale rebellion on Corsica which saw the French garrison driven into three fortified positions on the Northern Coast.Gregory, p.26 In early 1794 a British force invaded Corsica and defeated the French, Paoli seceding from France and agreeing to the incorporation of Corsica as a self-governing kingdom within the British Empire.Gregory, p.65 Following political conflict, Paoli was driven into exile in late 1795,Gregory, p.107 and the British remained on Corsica until late 1796, at which point the island rejoined the French Republic.Gregory, p.158 In France the defeat led to the recall of Truguet to Paris to explain events to the National Convention, and his temporary replacement by Trogoff de Kerlessy.Ireland, p.81 The defeat undermined morale among the fleet and civil authorities at Toulon, exacerbating existing revolutionary tensions. A series of mutinies and public executions followed against the background the burgeoning Reign of Terror.Ireland, p.158 When ordered to attack L√°ngara's fleet off Toulon in June, Trogoff refused as he believed his crews would refuse to put to sea, and announced that he would delay action until Truguet returned.Ireland, p.163 In July, a large British fleet arrived off the port under Vice-Admiral Lord Hood, and political authority in Toulon collapsed entirely, with the Girondist civil government declaring for the exiled French monarchy and inviting the British to occupy the town and seize the fleet on 18 August.Ireland, p.170 Trogoff acquiesced in the occupation, despite a revolt among the sailors under his command.Ireland, p.177 French Republican forces attacked the city, and in the ensuing Siege of Toulon the climactic assault which retook the heights over the city in December 1793 was led by Napoleon, who was wounded in the attack.Ireland, p.264 He later became one of the most effective generals of the French Republic and subsequently seized control of the country and pronounced himself Emperor of France.McLynn, p.302 References Bibliography  * Battles of the War of the First Coalition Battles involving France Battles involving the Kingdom of Sardinia Battles in Sardinia 1793 in military history Conflicts in 1793 ","title":"French expedition to Sardinia"},{"id":"55361532","text":"Loch Achanalt is a small, irregularly shaped, lowland freshwater loch in Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands, close to Achanalt railway station and the village of Achanalt.

Histology and ultrastructure  Rinehart and Farquhar first discovered FS cells through electron microscopy of the anterior pituitary gland. Vila-Porcile named these non-endocrine cells \\"folliculo-stellate\\" cells in 1972 due to their stellate (star) shape, and their location lining the lumen of small follicules in the anterior pituitary. Unlike the majority of cells in the anterior pituitary, they are non-endocrine and agranular. They have long cytoplasmic processes which interlock to form a mesh, within which the endocrine cells reside. They typically have a large number of microvilli on their apical side, and contain lysosomes, suggesting phagocytotic activity. Gap junctions can be seen between the FS cells and the adjacent endocrine cells when viewed under an electron microscope. Staining patterns of anterior pituitary hormones and S-100 protein  Cell properties  Using pituitary slices, studies have been conducted that have illustrated that FS cells are arranged into 3D networks which are able to communicate intracellularly through gap junction-mediated calcium wave propagation. Experiments using two main FS cell lines (TtT/GF and Tpit/F1), have hugely improved our knowledge of the functional relevance of these cells- it has been shown that FS cells play a part in three areas of pituitary use: autocrine/paracrine control of anterior pituitary cell function though the use of cytokines and growth factors, intrapituitary communication among various cell types, and modulation of inflammatory response feedback. FS cells have similar properties to dendritic cells and macrophages, implying a phagocytic role. FS cells having a main role in moderating the neuro-immune/endocrine regulation of inflammation is backed up by data in conjunction with depicting C3a, C5a receptors (which are the main factors of the innate immune system, secreting IL-6 and MIF (inflammatory cytokines), and controlling the release of these cytokines via anti-inflammatory molecules. Experiments have been carried out to assess the protein markers they express, in order to determine their cell-type and thus exact function in the pituitary. The first marker protein discovered in FS cells was S-100b, which is a calcium-binding protein expressed by glial cells. Some populations of FS cells have also been found to express different cell markers, including GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), cytokeratin, vimentin and fibronectin. S-100 protein and GFAP expression seem to be strongest in early, newly-formed FS cells, thus could be important in early FS cell development. GFAP expression implies these cells could be of a neuroectodermal origin, whereas keratin-positive FS cells express epithelial-like characteristics. The study of fibronectin expression in these cells suggests that FS cells may help regulate pituitary function, by interacting with hormone secreting cells through fibronectin. Furthermore, as FS cells express vimentin, an intermediate filament protein marker, this supports the theory that FS cells may be derived from glial neuroectodermic cells. Due to the different array of markers expressed in these cells, it is difficult to specify their exact cell-type and function. Newer findings propose that pituitary FS cells are made up of groups of cells with disparate immunophenotypes and are not a homogeneous population; however, it still isn't clear if these groups of cells are actually different or are simply cells at varying stages in their development. Multiple FS cell lines have been developed to try to observe the location and function of these cells. mRNA levels of FS cells has been investigated via laser capture microdissection and RT-PCR, so progress is being made in terms of understanding the expression and function of these non-endocrine cells of the pituitary. As they have multiple markers, it is plausible that these cells are a hybrid of several different cell types.  Gap junctions between endocrine cells and FS cells  Although FS cells do not secrete hormones, they influence the functionality of hormone- secreting endocrine cells via gap junctions. FS cells form homologous gap junctions with their adjacent counterparts, but also heterologous gap junctions with hormone-secreting endocrine cells. The gap junctions that exist between adjacent FS cells are used to propagate calcium-mediated signals throughout the pituitary to coordinate the function of excitable endocrine cells distributed throughout the gland. The endocrine-FS cell gap junctions, alongside the FS-FS gap junctions form a cell network that allows information about the physiological environment to be transferred around the pituitary to coordinate its secretory function. Studies in various small mammals have demonstrated that the number of gap junctions is influenced by several factors, such as puberty, the menstrual cycle and lactation. In the mink, the presence of the connexin-43 protein that is functional in gap junctions, correlates to prolactin secretory demand depending on the breeding season. When prolactin secretion is highest in the spring there is the highest abundance of connexin-43 gap junctions; prolactin secretion and gap junctions are lowest in the winter. Thus demonstrating that the FS-cell network has a role in influencing prolactin secretion. This is consistent with studies in rats which found that gap junctions increased during lactation to facilitate prolactin demand. Additional studies in rats found that the number of gap junctions increases with anterior pituitary maturation, and this increase was prevented by castration in male rats which would prevent sexual maturation, and was restored to normal levels by hormone treatment. Similarly, gap junctions increase during pro-oestrus and oestrus phases of the oestrous cycle, and are decreased by fifty percent during di-oestrus. Evidently, the number of gap junctions is influenced by steroid hormone secretion from the gonads, and FS cells contribute to the pituitary-gonadal feedback loop.  Function as sustentacular cells  Folliculostellate (FS) cells are asserted to be of sustentacular (support) function due to their positioning alongside the endocrine (hormone-secreting) cells of the pituitary gland, implying an either mechanical or chemical support ‚Äì by forming structural support around the endocrine cells or releasing growth factors and cytokines (cell-signalling molecules. Structural support is exemplified in that FS cells are known to produce Metalloprotease inhibitor which may protect the basement membrane and maintain three-dimensional structural support; as well as surrounding endocrine cells, forming close contact to provide the growth factors and cytokines, within the pituitary gland.  Role as signalling mediators for pituitary endocrine cells   Nitric oxide  FS Cells are thought to have a role in relaying signals to the hormone secreting endocrine cells of the pituitary gland. Nitric Oxide (NO), is reported to be a key modulator of endocrine cell function and has been shown that FS cells (and some endocrine cells) contain neuronal NO synthase, a key NO production enzyme which is responsible for the production of NO from L-arginine. It is thought that FS cells modulate NO production in adjacent endocrine cells via paracrine mechanisms.  Interferon-gamma  Interferon-gamma is a cytokine that acts to inhibit the release of various hormones from the anterior pituitary, FS cells are thought to be vital in mediating this process. This facilitating role of FS cells was identified when studying the anterior pituitary glands of rats, as anterior pituitary samples with few FS cells failed to exhibit the usual inhibitory effects of interferon-gamma.  Glucocorticoids  Glucocorticoid induced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has 2 components. Firstly, within 15 minutes of increased glucocorticoid exposure in the anterior pituitary, there is a reduction in the release of preformed adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Secondly, glucocorticoids act at a genomic level by suppressing the translation of ACTH and CRH: this process takes 2 hours after exposure to increased glucocorticoids. The protein Annexin A1 (ANXA1), found in high quantities in the anterior pituitary gland, is located specifically in the folliculostellate cell. In addition to the anterior pituitary gland, it can also be found in the non-endocrine cells of the hypothalamus. Glucocorticoids act on the folliculostellate cells to increase synthesis of ANXA1 and then stimulate its translocation to the cell surface of the FS cell. This translocation is dependent on protein kinase C. ANXA1 subsequently acts on the corticotrophs of the anterior pituitary, which express ANXA1 G protein coupled receptors, via a paracrine mechanism. The downstream signalling pathway which culminates in reduced ACTH synthesis and/or release remains largely unexplored and as consequence remains poorly understood. The glucocorticoid/folliculostellate cell relationship also has a role in the production of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamine. Cells in rat anterior pituitary gland which contain large quantities of the enzyme glutamine synthetase also express the S100 protein which is the marker for folliculostellate cells. After exogenous glucocorticoid administration, the number of these cells increases and the activity of glutamine synthetase also increases. This enzyme is necessary as it allows the CNS to produce glutamine internally. This is essential as the quantity of glutamine transported from the peripheral blood to the CNS cannot satisfy the demands of the CNS for glutamine.  Interleukin-6  The production of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) could also be said to be a supportive function, as the IL-6 is a mediator in communication between the endocrine and immune system. IL-6 production by FS cells induces hormone production from endocrine cells, which can then activate the immune system.  Potential function as stem cells  There has been some suggesting evidence through numerous studies that FS cells may act as pituitary stem cells (SC). Indirect evidence from goat as well as rat cells has led to suggestions that the S100Œ≤+ cells may act as intermediate cells during the formation of adult pituitary cells. Nonetheless, more research needs to be done to clarify the potential stem cell properties of FS cells.

Life   Early years  Rudolf \\"Rudi\\" Wetzel was born in Rechenberg, a small town in the mining region of Saxony on the frontier with what was, at that time, the Austrian province of Bohemia. His father worked as a decorator and furniture painter. After leaving school he attended the Construction Academy in Dresden before embarking, in 1929, on the study of Pedagogy at the Dresden Technical University (\\"TU Dresden\\"). It was also in 1929 that he joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). In 1931 he switched to the Communist Party. During the next couple of years he served as a party officer as chair of the Communist Students's Association in Dresden. It was also during this time that he met the Hungarian Communist activist, Inke Rosza, who became his partner - probably also at some stage his wife. Early in 1933 the Nazis took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire at the end of February 1933 was blamed, with implausible haste, on \\"communists\\" and indeed people with records as communist activists were among those most assiduously targeted by the authorities. Wetzel continued with his political activity after it became illegal and was first taken into \\"protective custody\\" in 1933, which put an end to his student career. In 1934 he was sentenced to a two-year prison term for \\"preparing to commit high treason\\". When the two years had been served he was transferred to the Sachsenburg concentration camp. He was released in 1937, shortly after which he fled to Budapest with Inke. Then, travelling via Paris and London he made his way to Hull in eastern England where he trained and worked as a welder.  Swedish exile  In 1938 he moved on to Gothenburg and J√∂nk√∂ping in Sweden, where as a qualified welder he had no difficulty in obtaining work. He also joined the Swedish Metal Workers' Union. After his emigration to Sweden the Nazi police departments back in Germany identified Wetzel as a public enemy. They incorrectly believed that he was still in Britain. Early in 1940 the Security Services in Berlin added his name to the \\"Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.\\" (usually identified in English language sources as \\"Hitler's Black Book\\"), a list of (in the end) 2,820 individuals who would, in the event of a successful German invasion and occupation of Britain, be sought out by commando task forces and arrested as a priority. In August 1939 Wetzel was the author of the so-called \\"Gothenburg Resolution\\" which was critical of the non- aggression pact concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union that month. This opened Wetzel up to criticism from the leadership of the exiled Communist Party leadership based in Moscow. Wetzel's \\"Gothenburg Resolution\\" insisted that, despite the non-aggression pact, it was still Hitler and his power structure that must be seen as the true enemies of the German working class, rather than the old imperialist powers of Britain and France that were the implicit targets of understandings between Hitler and Stalin. Walter Ulbricht, already prominent among the exiled German communists in Moscow, issued instructions that German communists in Sweden should \\"isolate\\" Wetzel. Even if subsequent events may have vindicated Wetzel's judgements, incurring the suspicions of the man who later became the first leader of the German Democratic Republic is unlikely to have boosted his career prospects in Germany's Soviet occupation zone after 1945. In 1942 Wetzel relocated to Stockholm. The 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union had led to a stark political reconfiguration affecting the various strands of the exiled German communist party. Wetzel's \\"Gothenburg Resolution\\" had become redundant, and by 1943 he was again fully engaged in party work. Around this time he and Inke separated, remaining on friendly terms. He became editorial secretary of \\"Politische Information\\", a German language party newspaper produced in the Swedish capital. He also produced a significant number of articles for it, often using one of a succession of pseudonyms, including \\"Ber Wernau\\", \\"Karl Scharf\\" and \\"Max Richter\\". His activities also came to the attention of the authorities in Germany, and he was formally deprived of his German nationality on 21 October 1944.  Soviet occupation Zone / German Democratic Republic  War ended again in May 1945. The large central area of Germany surrounding Berlin, including Wetzel's Saxon homeland, was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone. He returned, now moving directly to Berlin, in January 1946, accompanied by his new Swedish wife, Inge: the marriage would prove short- lived. He was appointed to a senior management position with the press and broadcasting department of the Central Committee of the newly formed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). In 1947 he became head of the foreign press section, with the title \\"Second Deputy Head of the Agitation Department\\" (\\"2. stellvertretender Leiter der Abteilung Agitation\\"). The contentious launch in April 1946 of the SED had been part of a nation building exercise planned with Moscow support by a team of leading exiled German communists during the war years and implemented during the later 1940s. In October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), a new kind of one-party dictatorship. Wetzel was removed from his existing duties and sent to study at the \\"Karl Marx\\" Party Academy. Between 1950 and 1953 he served as managing editor of \\"Neuer Weg\\", a journal produced for SED party officials. At the same time he was a member of the presidium of the \\"International Journalists' Organisation\\". During the early part of 1953 he was briefly editor in chief at the news-magazine \\"Friedenspost\\" (literally \\"Peace Post). After a few months he was switched to Wochenpost, a weekly mass-circulation newspaper newly launched by the party central committee to cover politics, economics, business and the arts. Here, as the publication's first editor in chief, he was effectively its creator, always subject to the party's requirements. Also in 1953 he took over from Karl Bittel as Chairman at the (East) German Union of Journalists (\\"Verband der Deutschen Presse\\" / VDP). However, his position became increasingly precarious after 1956. On 27 October 1956, shocked by the attitude of the party leadership to the popular uprisings in Hungary and Poland, Wetzel joined with fellow editors to publish an open letter of protest addressed to the politburo. They called for \\"information faithful to the truth\\" (\\"wahrheitsgetreue(n) Informationen\\") and adherence to \\"Leninist standards of party and national life\\" (\\"Leninschen Normen des Partei- u. Staatslebens\\"). The wheels of the East German power structure ground into action and in January or March 1957, under pressure from the authorities, Wochenpost dispensed with the services of their founding editor. He was also removed from the chairmanship of the VDR. At the same time he was sharply criticised at a meeting of the Central Committee press department. The irritation of the leader, Walter Ulbricht, had been exacerbated by the fact that the editors' open letter to the politburo had included a line on the subject of \\"press freedom\\" which had already been rejected by the Central Committee when proposed for a prominent feature in Neues Deutschland, East Germany's principal daily newspaper. The fact that Wetzel and his fellow letter writers had included the rejected line in their open letter was seen by Ulbricht as a practical failure of personal loyalty on Wetzels' part.J√ºrgen Wilke: Journalisten und Journalismus in der DDR. Berufsorganisation - Westkorresponenten - \\"Der Schwarze Kanal\\", passim, especially p. 52. During the ensuing years Wetzel was regarded with renewed suspicion by the East German leadership, and he held a succession of relatively low-profile journalistic positions. In June 1957 he became an editor with \\"Freie Welt\\", an illustrated magazine, but in February 1958 he was dismissed without notice on account of his \\"ideological failings\\" by the \\"Culture and Progress\\" publishing house. In 1959 he found an editorship with the magazine \\"Urania\\". He was also contributing to publications such as \\"Wissen und Leben\\".  Later years  In 1965 Wetzel became a freelance journalist. He wrote for the Swedish trades union newspaper \\"Grafis\\" and othr Swedish publications a succession of articles about East Germany, and he contributed numerous articles about Sweden in the East German press. As an accredited journalist he also had opportunities to travel to the west. By 1968 - possibly earlier - he was under permanent Stasi surveillance, identified as a friend of the dissident intellectual Rudolf Bahro. During 1975-77 he was involved in the preparation for publication of Bahro's important work \\"The Alternative\\", which led to the arrest of Bahro. Wetzel was on several occasions questioned by the security services about the book and its publications - openly in the west. His wife lost her job at the Academy of Sciences and Humanities. But there was a reluctance on the part of the leadership to exaggerate the significance of the work, coupled with a determination to present Bahro as a lone voice: possibly for this reason, Wetzel was not subjected to any serious state mandated retribution in respect of his involvement with \\"The Alternative\\". Someone who had reached Wetzel's level of seniority in the journalism during the 1950s would normally have seen their eightieth birthday celebrated with a congratulatory message from the party, but early in January 1989 Wetzel's eightieth birthday passed without published comment in Neues Deutschland or any other mainstream publication. He had still not been forgiven for that open letter in 1956. Across the border in West Germany it was a different matter: newspapers such as the Frankfurter Rundschau marked the birthday of the communist \\"non-conformist\\" and \\"lateral thinker\\", quoting a maxim which he had himself used in the part: \\"Head held high and not the hands\\" (\\"Kopf hoch und nicht die H√§nde\\"). A couple of weeks later, however, on 25 January 1990, as the authorities struggled to come to terms with the changes slowly but surely transforming the old German Democratic Republic, an \\"extraordinary congress\\" of the VDP rehabilitated Wetzel. A few months later, still in 1990, he joined the Party of Democratic Socialism, which was a sometimes uneasy reincarnation, in contemplation of a democratic multi-party future, a relaunched version of the old SED. He did this, in his own words, \\"out of solidarity\\" (\\"aus Solidarit√§t\\").

The Supreme Court departed and overruled the earlier House of Lords case in Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital, in reconsidering the duty of care of a doctor towards a patient on medical treatment. The case changed the Bolam test to a greater test in medical negligence by introducing the general duty to attempt the disclosure of risks.[1957] 1 WLR 582 Facts The claimant was a woman of small stature and a diabetic under the care of a doctor during her pregnancy and labour. The doctor did not inform her of the 9-10% risk of shoulder dystocia, where the baby's shoulders are unable to pass through the pelvis among diabetic women as she viewed the problem being very slight and a caesarean section was not in the claimant's interest. The baby suffered from severe disabilities after birth due to shoulder dystocia. The claimant sought damages from the health board for negligence on the part of the doctor for failing to advise her on the risk of shoulder dystocia. The Court of Session ruled that there was no negligence based on the Hunter v Hanley test and that there was no causation since the claimant would not have submitted to a caesarean birth even if informed of the pregnancy risk. Judgment The Supreme Court affirmed the requirement of 'informed choice' or 'informed consent' by patients in medical treatment that rests fundamentally on the duty of disclosure by medical practitioners. Lords Kerr and Reed said: Lords Neuberger, Clarke, Wilson and Hodge agreed. Lady Hale gave a concurring opinion.

Their duty was to \\"prepare [the government's] agenda, frame resolutions, defend them, and supervise their execution\\". The Savii, six in number, were chosen from the members of the Venetian Senate, or Consiglio dei Pregadi, whence their name. As with other higher magistracies of Venice, restrictions were placed on the eligibility to the office: the members served a term of six months and could not be re-elected to the same office for six months thereafter. To ensure continuity, the appointments to the office were staggered: three took office on 1 October, three on 1 January, three on 1 April, and three on 1 July. Like all savi, the office did not carry a salary, but could be held in tandem with other public offices. The Savii were always present in, and in charge of the agenda of, the daily deliberations of the Full College (the Venetian cabinet). They were also obliged to be present in all sessions of the Council of Ten that had to do with foreign affairs. Consequently, and since no proposal could appear for vote before the Senate without having first been reviewed by the College, the Savii del Consiglio came to be part of a small core of officials who exercised the most control over the governance of the Republic, alongside the Doge of Venice, the six ducal councillors, and the heads of the Ten.

CNC is a rare syndrome that involves the formation of abnormal tumours that cause endocrine hyperactivity. PPNAD arises due to the enlargement of the cortex of the adrenal glands, resulting in Cushing's syndrome that is independent of the pituitary hormone ACTH.  Signs and symptoms  Diagram of Cushing's symptoms. Picture of lentigines associated with Carney Complex PPNAD is a rare cause of high cortisol levels in the blood and often manifests as ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. The effects of PPNAD can often be cyclical so the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome will not always be as severe, which may complicate diagnosis. The classic symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include rapid central weight gain, a puffy red face and a buffalo hump at the back of the neck due to fat deposits. Skin changes in Cushing's syndrome include thinning and bruising easily, developing striae and hyperpigmentation at skin folds. The hormonal changes can lead to hirsutism, males developing breast tissue, females no longer having periods and both sexes may become infertile. High cortisol levels can lead to psychological disturbances such as anxiety or depression and insomnia. Bone health can deteriorate, leading to an increased fracture risk in people with Cushing's syndrome. PPNAD is unique as it often causes Cushing's at a young age, in children and adolescents. In addition to the other symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, the patient may have a short stature due to interrupted growth because of ACTH suppression. In 90% of people with PPNAD it is associated with Carney Complex. Carney Complex is usually inherited, however it can also occur sporadically. A visible sign of Carney complex is abnormal skin hyperpigmentation. There may also be myxomas which can appear as lumps in the skin and breast as well as often being present in the heart, which can lead to multiple cardiovascular problems. The majority of people with PPNAD will have some of these signs/symptoms due to the strong association between PPNAD and Carney Complex.  Causes  PPNAD, the endocrine manifestation that comes from Carney Complex (CNC), can be syndromic or isolated. The main cause of isolated PPNAD is a mutation of PRKAR1Œ±, located at 17q22-24, which is the gene encoding the regulatory R1Œ± subunit of protein kinase A. Germline heterozygous PRKAR1Œ± inactivation mutations are present in 80% of CNC patients affected by Cushing's syndrome. There are over 117 mutations of the PRKAR1Œ± gene that can cause CNC, with many of these mutations producing premature stop codons, thus resulting in the complete loss of PRKAR1Œ± protein. CNC patients have also been discovered with an unusually shortened PRKAR1Œ± protein, detected in tumours and leukocytes, following a splice-site mutation, which causes exon-6 skipping. Therefore, both haploinsufficiency and the complete loss of PRKAR1Œ± can lead to the increased PKA activity observed in PPNAD patients, due to the disruption of the cAMP signalling pathway. Sahut-Barnola et al. used a mouse model to cre- lox knockout the Prkar1a gene specifically from cells of the adrenal cortex and observed that the mice subsequently developed Cushing syndrome that is independent of the pituitary. They also observed that the mutation caused increased PKA activity. The R1Œ± loss caused the adult adrenal gland became hyperactive and hyperplastic on both sides, as seemingly the foetal adrenal cells within it were not maintained and thus expanded. This established tumoral growths. This mouse KO model phenocopies what happens in human cases of PPNAD. Inactivation of PDE11A4, located at 2q31-5, has also been identified in PPNAD patients without PRKAR1Œ± mutations. PDE11A4 is the gene encoding phosphodiesterase 11A4, another participant of the cAMP signalling pathway.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis usually occurs upon investigation of a cause for already suspected Cushing's syndrome. High levels of cortisol observed in patients with PPNAD are not suppressed upon administration of dexamethasone (dexamethasone suppression test), and upon MRI or CT imaging, the pituitary will show no abnormalities. Measuring ACTH will confirm that the cause of the patients Cushing's syndrome is ACTH independent. The nature of Cushing's syndrome itself is periodic, which can make diagnosing PPNAD increasingly difficult. Diagnosis of PPNAD can be difficult to determine preoperatively as CT scan findings can be variable i.e. appear normal or suggest unilateral adrenal lesions therefore impeding the correct diagnosis. NP-59 scintigraphy may be particularly useful in identifying the bilateral nature of the disease. Gene studies are not necessary for diagnosis as there are clear gross and histological diagnostic markers, as the nodules can usually be seen clearly in both cases A positive family history of PPNAD has been shown to be associated with abnormal histological findings, e.g. mitotic figures, which may further hinder diagnosis. At the point where abdominal CT scanning and pituitary fossa MRI show no clear abnormalities, adrenalectomy may be performed.  Treatment  After diagnosis, it is important for patients to be continually monitored. The most common treatment for PPNAD is bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy; the process by which both adrenal glands are removed by a small incision. Patients who have received this treatment will be prescribed mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid steroids as they are no longer being naturally produced. This is a treatment which has been used and refined since 1984.

It is used by SAP's organization for their own internal IT resources to create a mix of different cloud computing environments made up of the Openstack services. It offers compute, storage, and platform services that are accessible to SAP. History In 2012, SAP promoted aspects of cloud computing. In October 2012, SAP announced a platform as a service offering called the SAP Cloud Platform In May 2013, a managed private cloud offering called the S/4HANA Enterprise Cloud service was announced. SAP Converged Cloud was announced in January 2015. SAP Converged Cloud is managed under a SAP business unit established in 2015 named The Converged Cloud unit, headed by Markus Riedinger as Unit manager. The Converged Cloud BETA went live in May 2017, included OpenStack technology-based storage, compute network components, and shared new services made by SAP: Later, Designate (DNS as a Service) was added as well. 2017 was the year SAP charged on superior cloud innovation for customers of all sizes. From SAP S/4HANA Cloud to SAP Ariba, SAP SuccessFactors and all of SAP's cloud applications, customers have access to a complete portfolio of cloud-based solutions to support their digital transformation journeys. On June 7, 2017, SAP announced that the company plans to invest over $1 billion in cloud over the next two years. Cloud computing challenges Moving between clouds Business organizations that want to use cloud computing have a choice of using a private cloud, which is a cloud infrastructure run specifically for a single organization that it built itself or by a third-party; or a public cloud, whereby a service provider makes available applications, storage, and other resources to the general public.Gohring, Nancy. \\"Private cloud vs. public cloud vs. hybrid cloud,\\" NetworkWorld. November 2, 2011. The decision of which to use is based on a number of factors, such as whether the company operates in a highly regulated sector, such as the pharmaceuticals industry that must comply with rules regarding the control and security of data, or if the business must bring services to market quickly, such as a web applications developer. The first would opt for a private cloud for security peace of mind, while the web developer would choose a public cloud offering. Most companies would operate a mixture the two, also known as hybrid cloud delivery. Employing a hybrid delivery cloud strategyKleyman, Bill. \\"Which Cloud Delivery Model is Right for Your Business?\\" July 2, 2013. Datacenterknowledge.com lets organizations use different cloud delivery services for specific applications.Linthicum, David. \\"Why the hybrid cloud model is the best approach,\\" InfoWorld. January 27, 2011. For instance, a public cloud may be a more cost-effective service for the compute-intensive task of processing analytics, but the data would remain local, or private, to comply with regulations. Because a hybrid delivery strategy lets organizations run applications and services across different clouds, collocation, and data centers, an example benefit of such a delivery mechanism is that organizations can move an app from one geographic location to another in major storms.Ness, Gregory. \\"Hybrid is a whole new cloud,\\" Seeking Alpha. December 14, 2012. There can be different types of hybrid clouds for specific tasks.Hurwitz, Judith; Kaufman, Marcia; Halper, Fern; Kirsch, Dan. \\"For Dummies: Exploring Hybrid Cloud Delivery Models,\\" June 2012. The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model can be a hybrid cloud in that it could use operating systems and virtualization technologies from both a public and private cloud infrastructure to provide cloud services. Other models that mix on-premises cloud with public cloud technologies include Platform as a Service (PaaS), which includes infrastructure services combined with development tools and middleware; and Software as a Service (SaaS), which is used to develop packaged software. However, moving data in the cloud can be a difficult procedure.Longbottom, Clive. \\"How to move data and applications in the cloud,\\" Computerweekly. Retrieved April 9, 2013. In the case of Software as a Service (SaaS), it is difficult particularly if the incumbent cloud provider used proprietary software, or if it altered an open source application. A way to mitigate cloud migration difficulties is to architect applications for the cloud that reduce or eliminate the dependencies between the cloud application stack and the capabilities of the cloud service provider.Claybrook, Bill. \\"Resolving cloud application migration issues,\\" SearchCloudComputing.Retrieved April 9, 2013. Another way is to select only generic and higher-level applications to move to the cloud in the first place. Another method is to select open standards for cloud computing. A best practice for avoiding cloud migration problems is to use a management platform that can support applications in any environment a user organization is likely to use. This has been described as using a \\"best-of-breed\\" approach.Claybrook, Bill. \\"Cloud interoperability: Problems and best practices,\\" Computerworld. June 1, 2011. Cloud professional services Companies engage cloud professional services consultants to help them plan how to incorporate cloud services into their business operations. Consultants advise businesses on whether to use public, private, or a hybrid delivery model, and how they should implement or consume those delivery models.Huston, Chad, Little, Gard, and Segal, Rebecca. (2013). \\"IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Cloud Professional Services 2013 Vendor Analysis,\\" For example, cloud professional services consultants might recommend that businesses interested in cost savings place appropriate applications in the public cloud, but keep a higher-security application in a private cloud or Hybrid cloud.Mooshian, Cassandara. (2014-2-21). \\"Industry-aligned cloud and digital portfolio enhancements will better position HP Services for growth in 2015,\\" TBR. In a 2013 competitive vendor analysis report by International Data Corporation, a market research firm, the authors state that cloud professional services can help companies map out both a short-term and a long- term strategy for how to use cloud in a way that aids their business goals. The most common reason businesses engage cloud professional services are for assistance with incorporating cloud technology into existing IT environments, and to plan how to implement cloud, according to a study published in February 2014 by the independent research firm Technology Business Research, Inc. According to published reports, the use of cloud professional services indicates that businesses do not have adequate internal resources that are knowledgeable about implementing cloud.Butler, Brandon. (2014-02-27). \\"Help! Most enterprises turn to consultants when using the cloud,\\" NetworkWorld.com. Converged Cloud characteristics and components Converged infrastructure SAP Converged Cloud follows the premise of Converged infrastructure: the integration of compute, storage, and networking components and technologies into self-provisioning pools of shared resources, and supported by IT services.Bernard, Allen. \\"Is converged infrastructure the future of the datacentre?\\" Computerworld.

Security in Converged Cloud SAP's Converged Cloud includes security features for businesses that connect to its private cloud through an on-site network, using Software-defined networking technology. Multiple copies of a Virtual LAN (VLAN) are supplied, providing a method for businesses to connect through the Firewall from their on-site network into the Converged Cloud, appearing to be part of the on-site network. Backup Service : Load Balancing: using F5 Networks, allows the service to do load balancing across the virtual servers in the cloud. Storage: Data is stored off-site for the File systems and Server operating systems. SAP retains local backups of PostgreSQL in the Swift containers for 30 days; User organizations choose 50GB, 100GB, or one-terabyte blocks of Storage area network (SAN) storage for server nodes, for which high-availability clustering can be added. Instances for Microsoft Windows Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. SAP Converged Cloud has a service solution for SAP HANA, a private service developed in SAP, for the SAP HANA in-memory database. Migration services are for businesses that want to move to the SAP HANA platform. The system is designed to enable businesses to analyze big data.

Set in the 1920s, the film recounts the true story of a group of youth at a summer camp on Balsam Lake in the Kawartha Lakes, who had to fight for survival when an unforeseen thunderstorm overwhelmed their canoe trip. The film's cast includes Brendan Fehr, Brendan Fletcher, Jake Manley, Gage Munroe and Dylan Everett. Plot In the opening scenes, Arthur Lambden, packs a photo of his son in his backpack and meets the young members of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew, and their leader, Robert Butcher, on the path to Long Point, a camp on the shores of Balsam Lake in the Kawartha Lakes, which is located 145 kilometres northeast of Toronto. Both Butcher, who is the camp leader and Lambden, who is second in command, are veterans of World War I. Butcher tells Lambden that, while it was his first time operating a camping trip at Long Point, the group had camped at Clear Lake for many years. He told Lambden that the youth‚Äîwhose fathers had died in the war or in the Spanish flu pandemic that followed the war‚Äîwould benefit from being the rugged outdoors. Butcher is concerned that the boys of the generation that succeeded their own, were being, \\"feminized by their mothers and teachers.\\" They begin their canoe trip late in the evening, and when their 30-foot war canoe is capsized during a sudden summer squall, drowning some, those that did survive spend the night in the frigid, dark lake waters clinging to the overturned canoe that is slowly sinking. The film flashes between scenes of the survivors struggling to ward of the freezing cold, and to fight fatigue and their fears, with lively, happy camp scenes earlier in the evening, of the boys engaging in camping activities designed for male bonding, creating a \\"band of brothers\\".The movie focuses on the individual lives of some of the characters before the camping trip. George Waller played by Jake Manley, had an abusive father; Arthur Lambden, played by Brendan Fletcher, had survived the front lines in World War I only to return home as a carrier of the Spanish flu virus that killed his own wife and child; the two brothers‚ÄîWill played by Sam Ashe Arnold and Jack played by Gage Munroe, whose father had been killed during the war; and Leonard, played by Matthew Isen, whose father had drowned just weeks before the camping trip and who feared water. After surviving a harrowing night on the lake, only four remain alive and finally crawl onto the shores of Grand Island. They find makeshift paddles and return to Long Point.

These cells are present in all mammals but their organisation and abundance varies between species. The exact role of PTM cells is still somewhat uncertain and further work into this is needed. However, a number of functions of these cells have been established. They are contractile cells which contain actin filaments and are primarily involved in transport of spermatozoa through the tubules. They provide structural integrity to the tubules through their involvement in laying down the basement membrane. This has also been shown to affect Sertoli cell function and PTM cells also communicate with Sertoli cells through the secretion of growth factors and ECM (extra-cellular matrix) components. Studies have shown PTM cells to be critical in achieving normal spermatogenesis. Overall, PTM cells have a role in both maintaining the structure of the tubules and regulating spermatogenesis through cellular interaction.  Structure  PTM cells are endothelial cells which are understood to have derived from mesonephric cells. The structure and organization between PTM cells have been observed to be distinctly different between mammalian species. In humans, PTM cells are spindle shaped and form several thin elongated layers, approximately 5-7 cell layers, and surround Sertoli cells. These are detected in the lamina propria of the seminiferous tubule and immunohistochemical studies have shown functional distinctions between these layers. The inner layers have been shown to express desmin, a smooth muscle phenotype, whereas the outer layers express vimentin, a connective tissue phenotype. In rodents, PTM cells are one layer thick. Both human and rodent PTM cells are joined by junctional complexes.  Function   Contractile  Peritubular myoid cells are responsible for the contractile nature of the seminiferous tubule. This contraction helps move the spermatozoa and fluid to the rete testes. There are a number of mediators involved in the regulation of contraction. Oxytocin produced by leydig cells has been shown to be a driving factor in the contractions by acting on peritubular myoid cells. As no oxytocin receptors are found on the peritubular myoid cells it is thought the oxytocin causes the activation of the vasopressin receptors. However, the full mechanisms behind the contractibility are unknown. Other factors including transforming growth factor b, prostaglandins and nitric oxide are also thought to be involved.  Spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal  Peritubular myoid cells play a crucial role in the self-renewal and maintenance of the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) population. For those SSCs destined to form differentiating progenitor A1 spermatogonia (and hence spermatozoa), this is initiated at a defined stage during the spermatogenic cycle. The precise location of SSCs throughout various staged cohorts of the seminiferous tubule determines their renewal function, to continuously produce progeny. During stages II and IV of spermatogenesis, GDNF is secreted by peritubular myoid cells upon testosterone binding the androgen receptor (in contrast to GDNF secretion by the Sertoli cells during stages IX and I). Following this, GDNF binds GFRA1 on spermatogonial stem cells, and RET co-receptor (a transmembrane tyrosine kinase) is consequently signalled throughout all undifferentiated spermatogonia. Thus, SFK signalling is upregulated and genes encoding key transcription factors (bcl6b, brachyury, Id4, Lhx1) become activated. The histochemical marker, alkaline phosphatase (stimulated by testosterone and retinol) has been useful for investigating peritubular myoid cell function and differentiation, as it has been shown to have activity in the peritubular myoid cell of the rat.  Differentiation  PTMs become recognisable at 12 weeks gestation in humans, and 13.5 days post conception in mice. However, where they arise from is currently unclear. Previous studies suggested that PTMs originate from a group of cells called mesonephric cells, which migrate into the developing gonad from an adjacent area called the mesonephric primordia. It was thought that the mesonephric cells would then have one of three fates: becoming Leydig cells, vascular tissue or myoid cells. Those becoming myoid cells would sit on a basement membrane surrounding the developing seminiferous tubules. However, more recent evidence has found that mesonephric cells do not give rise to PTMs but instead have only a vascular fate, leaving more uncertainty over where PTMs come from. The main difficulty in studying the development of PTMs is the lack of a molecular marker specific to them that is visible during early differentiation of the testis. Current knowledge suggests that PTMs arise from cells within the developing gonad itself, or alternatively from a layer of cells surrounding the outside of the gonad, called coelomic epithelium, by a process named epithelial-mesenchymal transition. PTMs acquire androgen receptors during their development, enabling them to respond to androgens which help them to maintain seminiferous tubule function.  History  PTMs were first observed in 1901, when Claudius Regaud made a detailed study of the histology and physiology of the seminiferous tubules in rats. He described the PTMs as a single layer of flattened cells, which enclose the seminiferous tubules, and called them ‚Äò‚Äômodified connective tissue cells‚Äô‚Äô. In 1958, Yves Clermont made a further investigation of the cells by electron microscopy. He found that these cells have a cytological resemblance to smooth muscle cells ‚Äì they contain actin filaments, have invaginations at the cell surface and their organelles are located in the centre of the cell. He also suggested that these cells are responsible for the tubular contraction and referred to them as ‚Äò‚Äôinterlamellar cells‚Äô‚Äô. Subsequently, in 1967, Michael Ross studied the fine structure of these cells in mice and proved that the smooth muscle-like cells are contractile. He called them ‚Äò‚Äôperitubular contractile cells‚Äô‚Äô. In 1969, Don Wayne Fawcett et al. termed these cells ‚Äò‚Äôperitubular myoid cells‚Äô‚Äô, because of their similarities to smooth muscle cells.  Etymology  As PTMs became better characterized, the associated nomenclature underwent a series of changes. In very early literature these cells may be referred to as ‚Äòmodified connective tissue cells‚Äô or ‚Äòinterlamellar cells‚Äô. Subsequent experiments resulted in renaming these cells to better reflect their contractile nature. The term ‚Äòperitubular contractile cells‚Äô was first used in 1967. In 1969, Don Fawcett labelled these cells as ‚Äòperitubular myoid cells‚Äô. ‚ÄòPeritubular‚Äô refers to their anatomical location: adjacent to the seminiferous tubule. ‚ÄòMyoid‚Äô stems from the Greek ‚Äòmyo‚Äô (/Ààm å…™…ô ä/), which means relating to muscle. (PTMs resemble smooth muscle cells under an electron microscope).

The story of Ankhi O Tar Bandhura is based on a book written by a popular Bangladeshi author Muhammed Zafar Iqbal.  Plot  Titu's life at home and at school is miserable. Although Titu is his nickname, everyone calls him ‚ÄòTita‚Äô meaning sour. He hates just about everything. He thinks his teachers don't understand children; they become mad at them for no reason. He can't go to the library as it remains locked. Teachers insist on memorizing lessons. His elder brother Tito is an expert in doing that. Everyone considers him a good student. Since Titu doesn't like rote learning, so everyone thinks he doesn't like his studies. Titu's school gets a new head mistress‚ÄîDr. Raisa. She begins to change everything. She stops the practice of caning. She opens up the library and talks to everyone with a smile. She never gets angry with anyone. DrRaisa believes that the system of our education is faulty. It's not good that only the teachers will talk and the students listen. This is one reason why students are not attentive. They have lost interest in studies. Dr Raisa convinces a visually impaired girl, Ankhi, to attend her school rather than one for the visually handicapped. But finding her teachers uncooperative, Ankhi decides to leave school. Her friends however, intervene. They stand behind her. Ankhi tells them that she doesn't want to be considered a ‚Äòblind‚Äô girl. She wants to be just an ordinary girl, like any other. Her friends take the challenge. None of them thinks Ankhi is any different, least of all being a ‚Äòblind‚Äô girl. But wanting to be normal is one thing, becoming one is quite another. Ankhi can't play with anyone. Titu however finds out that although Ankhi can't see, she can hear things much better than others. Titu takes the help of a shoe smith and makes a cricket ball which makes a sound when it's in play. He presents the ball to Ankhi. Ankhi feels ecstatic. She can now catch the ball when it flies, and can hit it with her bat. She becomes an excellent cricket player and shows everyone that blind people can do things just like the sighted ones if they are given an opportunity. The shoe smith doesn't take any money for the ball, but Dr Raisa brings him to school and honours him. To celebrate their team's becoming champion in the cricket tournament, Ankhi visits Bandarban with her friends. There they are kidnapped by a gang of robbers who take Ankhi and five of her friends to a secret hideout. Their intention is to sell the girls to traffickers who will take them to Yangon. But Ankhi and her friends show exemplary presence of mind and intelligence to escape, and help the security forces capture the kidnappers. Seeing the way Ankhi has developed, other differently challenged girls and boys enroll in her school. Even a wheel chair bound student joins the school's football team.

The primordial follicle in the oocyte is what makes up the ‚Äúpool‚Äù of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre- ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during ovulation. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called folliculogenesis. Activation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal granulosa cells, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective zona pellucida layer, and growth of the oocyte. It is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.  Activation of Primordial Follicle Development  Primordial follicles are activated to grow into antral follicles. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the theca cells, is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: Neurotropin, nerve growth factor (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), neurotrophin 4 (NT4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B), growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenic protein 15 (BMP15).  GDF9  Follicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth. GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.  TGF-Œ≤  As discussed above TGF-Œ≤ ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-Œ≤ signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-Œ≤ for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.  Foxl2  Another molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.  Sohlh1  Spermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle. Repression of Primordial Follicle Activation PTEN Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumour suppressor gene whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice. The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production. This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool. Foxo3 When Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated. This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation. AKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation. The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy. TSC and mTOR Tuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of mTORC1 activity. Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency. AMH AMH (Anti-mullerian Hormone) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27 P27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2. Due to its important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.  Medical Consequences   Premature Ovarian Failure (POF)  Premature ovarian failure (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary amenorrhea, before the age of 40. It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated atresia of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L., Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes. FOXL2 - FOXL2 knockout mouse models showed failure of granulosa cell differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified. Additionally, mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found in approximately 5% of nonsyndromic POF patients, which suggests that FOXL2 mutations are also associated with idiopathic POF. BMP15 and GDF9 - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF. SOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls. AMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF antral follicles leads to defective antral development. mTORC1 and PI3K - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility. PTEN - Studies of mice with a deletion in PTEN in the oocytes showed early activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, leading to a lack of primordial follicles in adulthood, resulting in a POF phenotype. Foxo3a - Studies into mice with complete and partial Foxo3a deletions also showed premature activation of the entire primordial follicle pool, destroying the ovarian reserve and leading to oocyte death. This led to a POF phenotype, seen in studies in a range of countries., TSC - In the oocytes of Tsc2 knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.  Chemotherapy and Ovarian Follicle Activation  As well as having many genetic causes, premature ovarian failure has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents. The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be dose- dependent, and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as alkylating agents, seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs: # By direct damage to the primordial follicle, causing cell death by toxicity # By indirect damage to the stromal cells which surround the follicle and support it, to allow it to grow. Loss of these supporting cells then leads to death of the follicle. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop. These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure. Oocyte cryopreservation Oocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy. There are several methods of cryopreservation, each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.  Restoration of Ovarian Activity after Cryopreservation  Restoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in oestrogen, a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were detected. The variation in time difference may be due to differences in the follicular reserves in the women at the time of cryopreservation.

It was his first completed oil painting and is signed \\"Dante Gabriele Rossetti P.R.B. 1849\\". He first exhibited it at the 'Free Exhibition' at the Hyde Park Corner Gallery. History Rossetti began the work in summer 1848, working hard and aiming to have it completed for exhibition in March 1849. In November 1848 he mentioned his choice of subject in a letter to his father's friend, Charles Lyell of Kinnordy, stating that it would definitely appeal to members of a religious community. It was a common subject in medieval and renaissance art and usually shows Mary with a book on her lap as her mother, Anne, teaches her to read. But instead Rossetti shows Mary embroidering a lily (traditional symbol of Mary's purity) under Anne's guidance while her father, Joachim, prunes a vine in the background, referring to the coming of Christ (who calls himself \\"the True Vine\\" in John 15.1). The vine is shaped like a cross, prefiguring Christ's passion. Rossetti made several preliminary studies in chalk and the Scottish poet and artist William Bell Scott saw the work in progress in Hunt's studio and remarked on young Rossetti's technique: The models were sourced from close to home - Anne was portrayed by Rossetti's mother Frances, his sister Christina Georgina modelled for Mary, and the family servant Williams for Joachim. The angel's face was originally based on the half-sister of Thomas Woolner (1825-1892), but in August 1849 Rossetti replaced her features with those of another girl, recommended to him by his fellow Pre-Raphaelite James Collinson (1825-1881). Rossetti wrote two sonnets to explain the painting's symbolism - the first was engraved at the bottom of the original frame, whilst the second was printed in the Free Exhibition catalogue.Catalogue of the Free Exhibition p.18 A crossed palm branch on the floor refers to Palm Sunday and Good Friday and the pale roses and thorn-shaped branches on the wall to Christ's passion and Mary's seven joys and seven sorrows. The oil lamp symbolises piety, three of the books are in colours symbolising the three cardinal virtues and the rose is another symbol of Mary (the 'rose without a thorn'). The Annunciation is prefigured by a dove, symbolising the Holy Spirit, It received a generally good reception and reviews at the Free Exhibition. It was bought for ¬£80 by Louisa, marchioness of Bath, wife of John Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath and a family friend of the Rossettis - Rossetti repainted Mary's dress and the angel's face before sending the work to her, whilst the payment for it funded a trip to Belgium and France by him and William Holman Hunt. It was exhibited again in 1850 in the Portland Gallery Exhibitions at the Royal Academy, where it received a less friendly reception. By 1864 it was owned by Lady Louise Fielding, who that year sent it back to Rossetti for repainting - he turned the angel's wings from white to deep pink and Mary's sleeves from yellow to brown. The original frame with its rounded upper corners was also replaced by a rectangular frame with both of Rossetti's sonnets on its base.Rossetti Archive References Bibliography *Prettejohn, Elizabeth, The Art of the Pre-Raphaelites, 2007, Tate Publishing, Millbank, London. *Donnelly, Brian, Sonnet-Image-Intertext: Reading Rossetti's the Girlhood of Mary Virgin and Found, article in Victorian Poetry, Vol. 48, No. 4 Paintings by Dante Gabriel Rossetti Collection of the Tate galleries 1849 paintings Paintings of the Virgin Mary Angels in art Books in art ","title":"The Girlhood of Mary Virgin"},{"id":"55362293","title":"2004 Indian Rajya Sabha elections"},{"id":"55362296","text":"John Jones (10 May 1899 - 14 March 1991) was an Australian cricketer.

Rev. James T. and Maggie May Upchurch opened the home on May 14, 1903, and it took in homeless, usually pregnant, women from Texas and the surrounding states. Unlike other homes for \\"fallen women\\", women at the Berachah Home were required to keep their babies; no children were given up for adoption. The home closed in 1935 but reopened as an orphanage named the Berachah Child Institute, which existed from 1936 to 1942. The University of Texas at Arlington purchased the property in 1963. On March 7, 1981, a Texas Historical Marker was installed and dedicated at the graveyard that served the Berachah Home.  History  James T. Upchurch was born on October 29, 1870, in Bosqueville, Texas. While living in Waco, Upchurch joined the Methodist Church and began mission work by conducting religious services in jails and on the streets. In 1892, he married Maggie May Adams, who was born on December 5, 1873, in Jackson, Tennessee; together they pursued their religious work. After encountering a woman in the red-light district of Waco, J. T. Upchurch began to focus his work ministering to these \\"fallen women\\". In 1894, the couple together founded the Berachah Rescue Society to address this social issue. The name Berachah derives from the Bible: it is found in 2 Chronicles 20:26 (\\"And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.\\" ‚ÄîKJV). In 1899, the Upchurches relocated to the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas and established a small mission. This mission moved from 612 Elm Street to 169 Main Street on October 31, 1899. J. T. Upchurch appealed to Christians in Dallas to help spread the gospel and reach out to \\"fallen\\" men and women as well as the city's street children. At this time, he also began to publish the Purity Journal. Written mostly by Upchurch himself, the journal describes the work being done by the Berachah Rescue Society. On September 25, 1901, J. T. Upchurch met with Mr. and Mrs. J. D. Cooper of Arlington, Texas, to acquire seven acres of land. The Berachah Industrial Home for the Redemption of Erring Girls opened on that site on May 14, 1903. The home's charter stated its purpose was to provide a space for \\"redemption and support\\", as well as a place in which to educate and train \\"erring girls\\". In addition to the home, other structures erected on the property included a chapel, handkerchief factory, infirmary, print shop, and school. Also established was a cemetery that contains the remains of young mothers who died during childbirth, stillborn babies, and former residents of the home who died during the measles epidemic. Eunice Williams was the first girl from the home to be buried in the cemetery in 1904. The Berachah Home, which operated just outside of the city limits, offered young women an opportunity to learning parenting and job skills to allow them to return to mainstream society. Retrieved March 17, 2018 ‚Äì via the Research Commons Funding for the home came from contributions made by local businessmen in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. By 1924, 129 women and girls were residents at the Berachah Home; their average age was 17. The home ultimately closed in 1935 due to insufficient funds. Women and girls at the home were relocated elsewhere. The Berachah Child Institute opened on the Berachah Home grounds on Easter Sunday, 1936. The Berachah Institute was founded for the care of children from broken homes. The orphanage was operated by Frank Wiese until it closed in 1942. Rev. J. T. Upchurch died at his home in Dallas on September 12, 1950.  References   Further reading  * Britton, Vickie. Old West Female Outlaws-Prostitution in the West-Soiled Doves. * Butts, J. Lee.

She is known for her work in quantum materials. In particular, she is known for the discovery of insulating materials which display simultaneous conduction-like behaviour under high magnetic fields. The World Economic Forum named her one of thirty Exceptional Young Scientists in 2013. Biography Suchitra Sebastian obtained an undergraduate degree in physics from the Women's Christian College, Chennai. She attended the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, where she received an MBA. She received a PhD in applied physics from Stanford University. Sebastian has been active in theatre. She performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe as a member of the Two Shades of Blue theatre troupe, and toured India and Nepal with the Rickshaw Theatre Project. Career After her MBA degree, Sebastian worked as a management consultant for a few years. She then decided to pursue physics as a career, and joined Stanford University for doctoral studies. Suchitra Sebastian's doctoral research was into barium copper silicate's transformation from a non-magnetic into a magnetic insulator under high magnetic field and low temperature. She discovered that the point of phase transition, the quantum critical point, occurs when the electrons' behaviour becomes two- dimensional, with the third dimension having almost no effect. In 2006, she co-published a paper revealing these findings. When the silicate is in its insulating state, the electron spins cancel each other out, but in the magnetic phase, under strong magnetic fields and low temperatures, the electrons form a Bose-Einstein condensate, with the electron spins suddenly unified. At the critical point, the spins from parallel layers stop affecting each other, and the magnetic waves stay within the plane of each layer, propagating in two dimensions. Sebastian's experiment was the first exploration of the immediate neighbourhood of the critical point in Bose- Einstein condensates. In 2015, Sebastian received a five-year grant from the European Research Council to work with cuprates to determine why they behave as high temperature superconductors. This entailed the suppression superconductivity under strong magnetic fields, and the examination of their resistive state. This revealed that electrons were forming twisted pockets in the weakest areas of superconductivity, in contrast to other researchers' finding that pockets formed in strong superconductive regions. She also discovered that the waves formed by alignment of electrons by their charge, called charge ordering, produce the pockets that are involved in the substance's superconductivity. In 2015, Sebastian and her team discovered that samarium hexaboride, an insulator at low temperatures, displays simultaneous conduction-like properties under strong magnetic fields. Samarium hexaboride also belongs to the class of topological insulators, which are insulators within their bulk but conductive on their surface. Sebastian found that samarium hexaboride acts as a simultaneous conductor and insulator within its bulk.

Archaeologist Madhusudan Dhaky has placed this temple after Nilkantha Mahadeva temple of Miani (VS 1260, 1204 CE). But there is an inscription dated VS 1290 (1234 CE). According to local legend, it was built by a Devdasi (temple dancer) in a single night. It was damaged by Mahmud of Ghazni. The temple was neglected for years and several artifacts of the temples were stolen. The temple is inscribed as the Monument of National Importance (N-GJ-77) by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). It was restored by ASI in 2009. Architecture The temple is an example of MƒÅru- Gurjara architecture. It is an east-facing panchayatana type temple complex, one central temple with four subsidiary shrines in four cardinal directions of it. This temple considered as the finest temple of its period. The temple constructed by sandstone is now in ruined condition. It stands of the plinth (jagati) and stylistically its similar to the temple at Sunak, though larger in size. The hall (rangamandapa) is also ruined. The jalaka work as well as the curvature of the minor shringas of spire (shikhara) resembles that at Miani which helps in establishing its date. Other helping factors include the types of sculptures and decorations. The dwarf pillars of the hall (mandapa) are simple. The roof of the temple is destroyed. The fragments of collapsed spire and the hall are scattered nearby. The outer walls and the door of sanctum is filled with carvings of deities and celestial beings (apsaras).

For two decades she taught journalism in her alma mater, the University of Zulia. In the 80's she was president of the Venezuelan state television channel, Venezolana de Televisi√≥n, and held a column of opinion in the newspaper El Universal for almost twenty years. Since 2014 she writes for the newspaper El Nacional. Colomina is recognized for her critical opinion of the political process that Hugo Chavez founded, with whom she has carried out several controversies through his government. Accordingly, she has been a victim of attacks on her physical integrity for her journalistic work. After her tenure as president of Venezolana de Televisi√≥n, she was publicly accused of improper handling of the channel's resources, statements that have not been proven before the justice.  Biography  His father, Francisco Colomina, was a cabinet-maker who emigrated to Venezuela to work in the Caribbean Petroleum Company, later returned to Spain to serve on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. At that time he met Aurora Reyero, with whom he married. After a while they settled in Maracaibo, Zulia state in Venezuela. Marta's younger brother Francisco was born there. Colomina married the poet Hesnor Rivero, of whom she later divorced. Together they had two daughters, Cealba and Marta Celina.  Education  She studied elementary school in Maracaibo and soon after high school in the Normal School, in Spain. Colomina also there studied in a school of nuns in Leon. In 1959 she returned to Venezuela and enrolled in the School of Journalism of the University of Zulia (LUZ), where she graduated in 1964 with a summa cum laude mention. During those years she was a teacher in the schools Nazaret and Siervas del Sant√≠simo in Maracaibo. Later, Colomina specialized in Communication Research at Stanford University in California, and studied other postgraduate courses at the University of Barcelona and the University of Sorbonne.  Career  Colomina taught for more than two decades in LUZ. She was head of the Department of Research and Public Opinion, and later was director of the School of Social Communication. At the same time, she chaired the Venezuelan Association of Communication Researchers. In 1986, on the recommendation of Sim√≥n Alberto Consalvi, President Jaime Lusinchi appointed her to the head of the state channel, Venezolana de Televisi√≥n, channel 8. She held that position until 1989. Later she was director of the newspaper El Nuevo Pa√≠s. From 1995 to 2014 she published an opinion column in the newspaper El Universal. In 1996 she started a morning program called 'La Entrevista' (The Interview) in Televen, which she held until 2005. He also held a two-hour radio program in the Uni√≥n Radio Circuit, from 1994 to 2011. According to human rights organizations, colleagues and Colomina itself, the cessation of its column, its radio and television programs, was due to pressures exerted by the government of Hugo Ch√°vez to the executives of those companies. Since 2014 she publishes his weekly column in the newspaper El Nacional.  Attacks against their integrity  On January 31, 2002, the headquarters of the daily newspaper As√≠ es la noticia was attacked with an explosive launched by two people on a motorcycle. This happened a day after Ib√©yise Pacheco, editor of the newspaper and Patricia Poleo, Marianella Salazar and Marta Colomina released a video of talks between the Venezuelan Army and the FARC's Colombian guerrilla. Two months later, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) issued a protective measure in favor of Colomina and the three other journalists. On October 21, 2002, an explosive device was launched at the headquarters of Union Radio in Chacao, damaging an adjacent building. On June 21, 2003, an audio device was exploded with pamphlets containing messages against Colomina, a hundred meters from the radio station and just as the journalist's program was being transmitted. Colomina was the victim of a molotov bomb attack on her car. The event was perpetrated by eight men with long firearms. The journalist left unscathed due to the bullet-proof material of the car's windshield. The IACHR reiterated the protection measures afterwards. Following the neglect of the Venezuelan government to take measures to preserve life ordered by the Court, the mayor of Chacao, Leopoldo L√≥pez assigned two municipal police escorts for her protection. On February 14, 2008 the assigned escorts were fired at, one of them shot dead. Colomina has also been attacked and verbally threatened by government officials, their followers and President Chavez himself. Former Defense Minister General Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a Carneiro stated that the journalist should be deported from the country because of her dual nationality. In 2003 several deputies of the National Assembly asked the Public Prosecutor's Office to open an investigation against her for the dissemination of information about looting in the city of Valencia. Deputy Iris Varela requested that her Venezuelan nationality to be revoked. Communication Minister William Izarra also responded in a haughty way to Colomina's coverage of these events. On December 1, 2008 a tear-gas grenade was dropped on the building where Colomina resided. In addition to the IACHR, several organizations such as Reporters Without Borders, the Human Rights Foundation and the Press and Society Institute have spoken out against verbal and physical attacks on the journalist.

Church An ancient church named Notre Dame des Martyrs, known as the first cathedral of Amiens, was founded in memory of Saint Firmin the Martyr. Later it became part of the Abbey of Notre Dame de Saint-Acheul. Modern historians have debated when and by whom the church was founded, but Bishop Rorico of Amiens () was confident that it was the oldest Christian building in Amiens and had been built by Saint Firmin the Confessor over the tombs of Saint Firmin the Martyr, Saint Acius and Saint Aciolus. Saint Firmin the Martyr was an evangelist and first Bishop of Amiens, who was martyred there in 287. The oldest surviving vitae of the first bishop-saints of Amiens mentions the church. The life of Firmin the Martyr relates that after he had been executed the senator Faustinian took the body and buried it in his personal cemetery in \\"Abladana\\". His son Firmin the Confessor built a church over the tomb, later to be known as Saint-Acheul, and was also buried there. Saint Salvius, Bishop of Amiens in the 7th century, found the tombs of the two Saint Firmins and the martyrs Acius and Aciolus. He moved the four bodies to the eastern crypt of the cathedral. The crypt under the church contains ancient tombs and bas-reliefs. It was discovered on 10 January 1697 during construction of a foundation for the main altar in the church. The monks claimed they had found the body of Saint Firmin, and said the relics in the Amiens Cathedral were not authentic. After lengthy controversy the relics in the cathedral were opened on 10 January 1715 and the 13th century inscriptions were taken to prove their authenticity. The vault of the 11th century church collapsed in 1751 and all the buildings were completely rebuilt in 1760. During the revolution the church became the parish church for the districts of La Neuville and Boutillerie. Under the Terror it was changed into stables. It was again made a parish church in 1844. The church has a classical sober stone architecture. The interior has a \\"Jesuit\\" style with a single span of and a vault that reaches . The facade has a large door surrounded by pilasters with Tuscan-style capitals. Higher up a bay and niches are arranged between pilasters with Doric capitals that support the triglyphic entablature, on which there is a triangular pediment. Under the choir there is a vault in the place where the body of Saint Firmin was miraculously discovered. The church holds several sarcophagi and 15th century bas-reliefs relating to the history of Saint Firmin. The church was protected as monument historique PA00116051 by decree of 8 December 1969. The church holds a noted statue of Notre Dame des Sept Douleurs (Our Lady of Seven Sorrows). Abbey The town of Amiens was jointly governed from the mid-10th century by the counts of Amiens-Valois and the Bishop of Amiens. This continued until 1074 when Count Raoul IV died and his son Simon became a monk. Bishop Rorico of Amiens established canons at Saint-Acheul in 1085. The foundation charter records donations to Saint-Acheul by Count Enguerran of Boves and his vidame Eustache. It was issued in the first year of Enguerran's rule, and praises his restoration of law and order. Throughout the 12th century the priory received much support from the bishops of Amiens. A monastery for the Augustinian canons regular was built by Bishop Tierry in 1145. The abbey bought land in the Neuville area in the 13th century and established vegetable gardens, from which it received payments from the cultivators. The plots were on drained marshland. Every year on a given date all the cultivators had to drain the canals around their plots and clean out all the wild plants that had been growing in the waterways and on their banks. The monastery was rebuilt in the 14th century. In 1634 it was united with the church of Saint Genevieve. The abbey was again rebuilt in the 17th‚Äì18th centuries. The manuscript diaries of Pierre de L'Estoile (1546‚Äì1611) were deposited in the library of the abbey by his descendant Pierre Poussemthe de L'Estoile when he died in 1718. Pierre Poussemthe de L'Estoile was the abbot of Saint Acheul. The diaries were used as sources for various historical works on the period of Henry III and Henry IV of France. The abbey held a head of Saint John the Baptist, one of several such heads in churches of France before the revolution. It remained in use until 1790. Jesuit college Church and abbey of Saint-Acheul in 1880 Louis Sellier, a layman who later became a Jesuit, founded a pensionnat at Amiens in 1797, which he gave to the Fathers of the Faith including Jean Nicolas Loriquet in 1803. The pensionnat was suppressed in 1812, but was succeeded in 1816 after the fall of the Empire by the minor seminary of Saint-Achuel, staffed by the former teachers of the pensionnat who had become Jesuits after the restoration of that order. The seminary was crowded into the old abbey and an old auxiliary building, with a 3-story building thrown up in 1818 to hold a study hall and dormitory, and two nearby houses. An ancient stable on the farm beside the abbey was also used as a study hall. The seminary was home to almost 900 resident students. There were almost 60 Jesuits and perhaps as many lay workers. Despite the austere conditions, the college was well off compared to most such establishments. In 14 years the seminary educated 70 Jesuits, 550 priests and 8 bishops. Alumni of the Jesuit college include: *Augustin de Backer (1809‚Äì73), Belgian Jesuit and bibliographer *Charles Cahier (1807‚Äì82), French antiquarian *C√©lestin Joseph F√©lix (1810‚Äì91), French Jesuit and preacher *Ivan Gagarin (1814‚Äì82), Russian Jesuit, founding editor of √âtudes *Peter Hasslacher (1810‚Äì76), German Jesuit missionary *Louis Lambillotte (1796‚Äì1855), Belgian Jesuit, composer and palaeographer of Church music *Francis Sylvester Mahony (1804‚Äì66), an Irish humorist and journalist *F√©lix Martin (1804‚Äì86), antiquary, historiographer, architect, and educationist *Carlos Sommervogel (1834‚Äì1902), French Jesuit scholar, author of the Biblioth√®que de la Compagnie de J√©sus *Charles Vilain XIIII (1803‚Äì78), Belgian politician The Jesuit college was closed in 1830. Later the building was used as a hospital. As of 2017 the abbey was occupied by a private lyc√©e.

The daughter of an army officer and colonial civil servant, she was educated in Kenya before moving to England to train a secretary. La Fontaine joined the SIS in 1967 and undertook her first missions in Africa. She became the personal assistant to the chief of the service in 1974 and later transferred to the SIS's department at the centre of the Cold War to support its operations behind the Iron Curtain. La Fontaine accepted a posting at the British Embassy in Hanoi six years later, becoming the sole regular Western source in Communist Vietnam. She returned to London in 1982 to the posting of the SIS's secretarial branch and retired twelve years later to take up her hobbies and two academical posts. Biography Early life and ancestry La Fontaine was born on 19 October 1937 in Nyeri, Kenya. She was the youngest of three children of army officer and colonial civil servant Sydney Hubert La Fontaine and his wife Honor Kathleen Milton. Sydney fought in both world wars, serving in East Africa during World War I and was stationed in Egypt during World War II. La Fontaine's ancestors were a Huguenot family who had fled to Great Britain following the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685. They joined the Levant Company shortly afterwards and settled in Constantinople in the 18th century. The family continued to maintain British citizenship and educated their children in England. These historical events may have led to La Fontaine developing a restless sense of adventure. She was educated at the Kenya High School for Girls. Career She flew to England to train as a secretary. In 1962 La Fontaine flew to Kinshasa (formerly L√©opoldville) to join her sister Jean and her husband John Sackur of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) to assist them in a research project. She found herself on the same aircraft months later but was chartered for the head of the Congolese Security Services, Victor Nendaka Bika. La Fontaine discovered that the plane was being used to ferry crates of gold bars. She formally joined the SIS in 1967 as a secretary. La Fontaine used to say the first thought of joining the services originated during a conservation from her Congolese mission five years earlier. When La Fontaine joined the service, it was small and thinly spread with most posts being occupied by an officer with support from a secretary. The method of communication was by morse code and \\"book and pad cipher\\", requiring staff to have self-reliance and resourcefulness. Although the SIS was male-dominated, there was a strong mutual trust that largely ignored age and rank and was stemmed from undertaking lonely and demanding jobs, in which the full responsibility went to secretaries. La Fontaine's first two missions in Africa saw her involved in the post's tasks that included meeting, debriefing and managing clandestine agents. In the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Gerald Williams wrote that she had \\"the right qualities for a role that called for intelligence, common sense, self-reliance, and the ability to impart confidence to those whose safety depended on her\\" which was made clear that she was \\"a good field operator.\\" La Fontaine became the personal assistant to the chief of the service in 1974 and learned the about the extent of the SIS's activities. She felt she discovered her niche after a series of unsatisfactory jobs in London and Nairobi and the service agreed. This led to the service to judge La Fontaine's performance as outstanding and she was awarded the MBE in 1976, a rare distinction in the service. She was transferred to the department at the centre of the SIS's activities in the Cold War in support of its difficult and dangerous operations behind the Iron Curtain. Later career and death La Fontaine was promoted in 1980, and accepted a post at the British Embassy in Hanoi. She was the sole regular source of Western intelligence inside Communist Vietnam and carried heavy responsibility. La Fontaine's presence made it hugely important for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who greatly valued her reporting and insights in the country, and the agency acknowledged her activities by awarding her the Meritorious Service Medal from the American people, a distinction normally reserved for CIA members. She became the head of the SIS's secretarial branch upon returning to London in 1982. La Fontaine moved up the ladder through her influence brought about by her directness and humanity and her undertaking of appointments in personnel management to the rank of under-secretary. She graduated from the Open University in 1983 with a Bachelor's degree in humanities. La Fontaine retired in 1994 and moved to Camberwell. La Fontaine pursued her interests in animal welfare, children's education and history. From 1995 and 2000, she served as the chair of governors of John Donne Primary School in Peckham and also worked as a research assistant on the Special Operations Executive's history. La Fontaine died of cancer at St Christopher's Hospice in Sydenham on 24 September 2012. She was unmarried. La Fontaine's funeral was attended by many people of the area in which she lived along with many of her colleagues in the SIS.

The E class 0-8-0 locomotives were part of the development of modern superheated types that had begun with the A class in 1906, and were intended for both mixed traffic in Norrland and heavy freight trains in southern Sweden. Many of them were rebuilt to the 2-8-0 E2 class between 1935 and 1951, enabling a speed increase from to . Three E class locomotives built for private railways became known as the E5 class following nationalization, as they were slightly heavier than the ones built for SJ. The E class was ill-suited for hauling express trains, due to their low speed, but they were otherwise used for all types of traffic and in all parts of Sweden. The light axle load meant that they could be used on minor lines and industrial railways, extending their use after mainline steam operations had been reduced. Both E and E2 class locomotives remained in daily service until 31 March 1972, the last day of regular steam operations on SJ. Most were then placed in the strategic reserve, where they remained until 1990, and many have been preserved.  Design  The E class 0-8-0 locomotives were part of the development of modern superheated locomotives that had begun with the A class in 1906. 130 were built between 1907 and 1920. Relatively strong, but with an axle load of only , they were intended for mixed traffic in Norrland and heavy freight trains in southern Sweden. The class had bar frames and inside cylinders, and all were delivered with fully enclosed cabs. They were given six-wheeled L class tenders, but some had larger A class tenders in the last years of use, increasing the operation radius. The boiler designed for the E class was also used for the Sb class tank engines, as SJ wanted to use standard parts for that class. For this reason the boiler was sometimes referred to as the ESb type. The G8 class locomotives were also rebuilt with E type boilers in 1950-1951. One E class locomotive was equipped for burning peat-based fuel for a short time. The class was very successful, but the low maximum speed (only ) was problematic. 90 locomotives were rebuilt between 1935 and 1951 with two leading wheels, enabling a modest increase to . The rebuilt locomotives became longer and heavier. The boiler was also moved a bit forward, making even more room in the large cab.  History  The E class was ill-suited for hauling express trains, due to the speed, but they were otherwise used for all types of traffic and in all parts of Sweden. The light axle load meant that they could be used on minor lines and industrial railways, extending their use after mainline steam operations had been reduced. E class locomotives sometimes appeared in Norway, both in cross- border traffic and leased to the Norwegian State Railways. At least one locomotive was in Norway during the German occupation. Both E and E2 class locomotives remained in daily service until 31 March 1972, the last day of regular steam operations on SJ. The very last train was hauled by E2 1194. Most of the locomotives were preserved in the strategic reserve when no longer needed in regular traffic, kept in usable condition to replace diesel-powered vehicles if the import of oil was interrupted or electric vehicles if the power supply was destroyed. The use of the reserve locomotives was mostly limited to a few trial runs, but harsh weather in the winter of 1965-1966 meant that an unusually large number of electric locomotives were out of service, and B, E and E2 class locomotives in the reserve were reactivated to haul trains on the electrified lines from Alvesta to Kalmar and Karlskrona. The E and E2 classes, together with the B and E10 classes, remained in the strategic reserve after most other types had been scrapped in the 1970s. Most of the locomotives were placed in sealed plastic bags with dehumidifiers to reduce the need of maintenance. A large number of E and E2 class locomotives were preserved in that manner until all steam locomotives were removed from the strategic reserve in 1990.  Private operators  KJ E 16 before nationalization. Two E class locomotives were delivered to private railway company Kalmar J√§rnv√§g (KJ) in 1917. They differed from the SJ locomotives in details and were slightly heavier, with a higher axle load. They also had a different type of tender. Neighboring railway S√§vsj√∂str√∂m-N√§ssj√∂ J√§rnv√§g (S√§NJ) bought an identical locomotive, but with a larger tender, in 1919. They were registered as SJ E class locomotives following nationalization, but were given their own designation, E5, in 1942. The former S√§NJ locomotive was scrapped in 1967 and the KJ ones in the early 1970s after having been in reserve since the 1950s. The railway between G√§vle and H√§rn√∂sand was built by the private company Ostkustbanan (OKB), the first section opening in 1923. The company was troubled financially from the beginning, and depended on loans from the state; it was controlled by the Swedish government from 1924. As part of the state aid, five A class and twelve E class locomotives were transferred from SJ to OKB before the start of large-scale traffic in 1927, retaining their class designations. They returned when OKB was nationalized in 1933, regaining their old numbers, and some were later rebuilt to the E2 class. One locomotive was sold to Uddevalla-V√§nersborg-Herrljunga J√§rnv√§g (UVHJ) in 1936, another to Sk√•ne-Sm√•lands J√§rnv√§g (SSJ) in 1937. Both returned to SJ in 1940 following nationalization.  Preservation  11 E and 26 E2 have been preserved in Sweden. These include three that have belonged to OKB and both locomotives formerly owned by SSJ and UVHJ. The first of the locomotives, number 900, was de facto transferred to the Swedish Railway Museum already in 1972, although formally included in the strategic reserve; others were sold to the museum or to heritage railways after being removed from the reserve. E 1090 was sold in 1994 to the Zuid-Limburgse Stoomtrein Maatschappij (ZLSM) in the Netherlands. In 1998 ZLSM also bought E2 1040. E2 909 was initially sold to a Swedish preservation society, but came to Hull‚ÄìChelsea‚ÄìWakefield Railway in 1992, while the Swedish owner was compensated with another locomotive from the strategic reserve. The purpose of this arrangement was to give the Hull‚ÄìChelsea‚ÄìWakefield Railway a locomotive that was ready for immediate use, not one that would need to be overhauled after its time in the reserve. E2 1122 is also abroad since 2015, leased to the Kr√∏deren Line. In October 2018 E2 1122 was hauled back to J√Ö√ÖJ in Sweden because the leasing contract ran out. Some locomotives that had been in storage along the Inland Line were taken over by Inlandsbanan AB (IBAB), the operator on that line, for use in tourist trains. E2 905 and a B class locomotive also owned by IBAB are the only usable steam locomotives owned by a commercial railway operator in Sweden.
