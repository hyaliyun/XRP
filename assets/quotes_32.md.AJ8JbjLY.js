Playing career Born in Barking, Powling began his career at Arsenal, signing on apprentice terms in September 1971. A regular for the club's reserve teams while still just fifteen, he turned professional in July 1973. He made his first-team debut in a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Queens Park Rangers on 27 October 1973, but only played twice more that season.

Tryggvi \\"the Pretender\\" (Old Norse Tryggvi √ìlafsson, Norwegian Tryggve Olavsson) was a Viking chieftain who lived in the early eleventh century, and came from \\"west across the sea\\" (probably from the Norse settlements in England and Ireland). His story appears in Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson, the saga Morkinskinna, and a saga composed by Oddr Snorrason on Olaf Tryggvason. Invasion of Norway According to Heimskringla, in 1033, during the lordship of Cnut the Great's son Svein over Norway, Tryggvi invaded Norway. He claimed to be the son of Olaf Tryggvason and his wife Gyda.Hollander (2002:534). His enemies scoffed at this claim, asserting that Tryggvi was instead the bastard son of a priest; however, Snorri Sturluson refers to Olaf's relatives in Viken as Tryggvi's \\"kinsmen;\\" moreover, the author of Morkinskinna has Harald Hardrada asserting kinship with the then-deceased Tryggvi, indicating that at least some people believed Tryggvi's claim.Hollander (2002:534‚Äî535); cf. Gade (2000:255). When word reached Svein and his mother √Ülfgifu of Northampton that Tryggvi's invasion was imminent, they summoned the landholders of H√•logaland and the Trondheim district to join the royal army in resisting Tryggvi. The jarl Einar Thambarskelfir, angered by the policies of Cnut's government, remained at home and refused to fight for Svein. Likewise, neither the powerful landowner K√°lfr √Årnason nor any of his brothers would fight for Svein.Hollander (2002:535).Shepton (1895:464). Svein and his forces made their way south to Agder, believing that Tryggvi would attempt to slip through the Skagerrak and join his supporters in Viken. Tryggvi, however, landed instead in Hordaland, then sailed to Rogaland to attack Svein's navy. The two fleets met off the island of Bokn, where only a few years before Erling Skjalgsson had been defeated and killed. During the battle, according to reports recorded by Snorri, Tryggvi hurled javelins at his enemies with both hands simultaneously, a feat for which Olaf Tryggvason had been known. He famously exclaimed \\"Thus did my father teach me to say mass,\\" simultaneously asserting his descent from King Olaf and mocking his enemies' allegation that his father was a priest. Despite his celebrated resourcefulness, Tryggvi's forces were overwhelmed by Svein's fleet and Tryggvi himself was killed.Hollander (2002:535); Shepton (1895:464); Jones (2001:385). An account preserved in Morkinskinna relates that Tryggvi was actually killed by a farmer after the battle. Many years later, when Harald Hardrada was king of Norway, he passed by the site of the battle. The king met an old friend of his who pointed out the alleged assassin. After questioning the purported killer and hearing him confess, King Harald had the man hanged, citing the familial bond between him and Tryggvi and his duty to avenge the latter's death.Gade (2000:255). Heimskringla A manuscript page of Heimskringla. A famous poem, Tryggvaflokkr, was written about Tryggvi. Excerpts of the poem, usually attributed to Canute's court poet Sighvat Thordarson, were preserved in Heimskringla: :For fame eager, forth fared :from the north King Tryggvi, :whilst Sveinn from the south forth :sailed to join the battle :From fray not far was I. :Fast they raised their banners :Swiftly then-rang sword 'gainst :sword-began the bloodshed.Hollander (2002:536). This poem also appears in Oddr Snorrason's longer saga. Shepton (1895:464). Another poem recorded in Heimskringla, by an unknown skald, mentions the battle against Tryggvi: :That Sunday morning, maiden, :much unlike it was to :days when at wassail women :wait on men with ale-drink: :when Sveinn the sailors bade his :sloops of war to fasten :by their bows, with carrion :battening hungry ravens.Hollander (2002:536).

Built about 1696, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Billerica. It has further associations with local and nationally prominent members of the Manning family, and is a significant early example of historic preservation in the United States. Since the mid-20th century it has typically housed a restaurant, under lease from a family association. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Manning Manse stands in an isolated setting of northern Billerica, on the south side of Chelmsford Road (Massachusetts Route 129) east of Executive Park Drive. It is set on about of land, which is surrounded on three sides by Warren H. Manning State Forest. The building now consists of three sections, organized in an L shape. The eastern part of the L is the original main house, to which modern additions have been made to the west. The main house is oriented facing south (away from the street). It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The roof on the north side extends down to the first floor, giving the building a saltbox profile. The area that is now Billerica was first settled in the 1640s, but the area west of the Concord River was not settled until after 1690. It is believed that this house, built about 1696 by Samuel Manning, was the first to be built there. It is one of only two 17th- century buildings standing in the town. Between 1752 and 1800 the Manning family operated a tavern out of the leanto portion of the house. It was occupied in the later years of the 18th century by the family of William Manning, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who wrote the anti- Federalist The Key of Liberty in 1798. Manning's children occupied the house until the last died in 1880, after which a trusteeship was established to oversee the property. It fell into decay until the 1890s, when Warren H. Manning spearheaded family efforts to restore the property. A landscape architect trained in the office of Frederick Law Olmsted, Manning purchased not just the house, but the surrounding lands that formed the basis of Manning State Forest. Manning conducted a carefully documented restoration of the house in 1899, and made it his summer home. A family association was eventually formed to take over the property, which has since leased it to a variety of restaurant operators. The building was extensively damaged by fire in 1994, but was again restored.

It is the site of a prehistoric Early Archaic Susquehanna culture (c. 5,000 to 3,000 BC) settlement, and is particularly significant as this is one of the only such sites in eastern New England that has no components from other time periods. Heather McCune discovered the site in 1980, on farmland leased from the state. The state archaeologist was informed, and an archaeological survey was conducted a year later. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Knowledge of the Susquehanna tradition Natives during the Archaic Period in Massachusetts is limited. Only a small number of sites have been found in the state; of those in the eastern portion, the two that were found before the McCune site were associated with funerary activities. It is unclear if the evidence that has been found of the Susquehanna in the area is the result of the movement of small bands into the area, or if it was part of a trade network with other Native cultures already resident there. As a distinctively Susquehanna site, evidence from the McCune site should be able to shed some light on this question.Cole, Stephen; Simon, Broma. NRHP nomination for McCune Site. Available by request from the National Park Service. The site consists of a partially open, partially wooded area of about , which is owned by the state. The open portion of the site is an agricultural field that had lain fallow for some time before the state leased it to a farmer. Plowing of the field turned up archaeologically interesting materials, and the state spent several days surveying the site to determine its bounds and gather surface samples. Large amounts of chipping debris (from the fabrication of stone tools) were found, as were three tools, all of Susquehanna tradition manufacture: a portion of a blade, a point tip, and a biface (stone hand axe). Charcoal and small quantities of red ochre were also recovered. Despite instructions not to, the field was again plowed in 1982; this action is not thought to have compromised the integrity of the site.

The park includes portions of the towns of Malden, Medford, Melrose, Stoneham, and Winchester. The roads inside the park and around its perimeter have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other portions of some of the roads are covered by more than one listing in the national register; see Fellsway Connector Parkways and Middlesex Fells Reservoirs Historic District. The Middlesex Fells Reservation is one of the oldest and largest of the parks in the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston. The reservation was created in 1894 with a gift of of land from The Trustees of Reservations to the Metropolitan Parks Commission, predecessor organization to the Metropolitan District Commission and today's Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). By 1897 the park had been expanded to some . This area included some existing roadways, which became internal roadways of the park. The border roads that surround the park followed a principle articulated by landscape designer Charles Eliot, who was instrumental in the preservation of the Fells, that such roads clearly delineated the bounds of the park, and provided its neighbors with pleasing views. Border parkways The parkways are described here in clockwise order, beginning in the south. These roads are generally two-lane paved roads, about wide, and in some cases briefly pass through portions of the reservation. South Border Road South Border Road runs from Roosevelt Circle, a major interchange including Interstate 93 and Fellsway West (Massachusetts Route 28) in Medford, along the southwestern border of the reservation, northwest into Winchester, where it ends at a junction that includes Highland Avenue, a noncontributing road that borders the reservation on the west, and the Mystic Valley Parkway, a parkway that joins the reservation to the DCR lands of the Mystic River Reservation. There are small, mostly unpaved, parking areas on the reservation side of the road providing access to trails. There is a small dead-end spur of the road that resulted from the construction of I-93, and there is a roughly section which runs inside the reservation as a result of land acquisitions south of the road. Hillcrest Parkway Hillcrest Parkway is a U-shaped road, both of whose ends are on Highland Avenue in Winchester. The parkway is, at , one of the shorter parkways in the system. The west side of the parkway (the inside of the U) consists of residential properties, most of which were developed in the early 20th century; the reservation is to the east. This roadway, which does not generally carry through traffic, is only wide and is unstriped. There is a scenic view of the North Reservoir near its northern end. The Near this point there was formerly a junction with a North Border Road, which has been fragmented and rerouted in part by the construction of I-93 and partially converted to hiking trails, and is not considered part of the National Register listing. South Street and Pond Street South Street runs from Main Street in Stoneham, at its junction with a newer section of North Border Road, for about east-southeast to a point where it merges into Pond Street. There is a grassy area, including a parking area, that provides fine views of Spot Pond, along this stretch of road. A non-park portion of Pond Street extends north toward the center of Stoneham, while the parkway section extends south into the interior of the park, flanking the eastern shore of Spot Pond. At its junction with Woodland Road it runs eastward to a junction with Fellsway East and the Lynn Fells Parkway, the latter a connecting parkway joining the Fells to the Breakheart Reservation. The section along the pond is four lanes wide, with opposing travel lanes separated by a wide grassy median. Fellsway East The northernmost section of Fellsway East runs either within or on the border of the Fells. From the junction with Pond Street in Stoneham, it runs south, forming a small miter (triangular) junction with Ravine Road, before passing, shortly afterward entering Melrose. After it passes Washington Street, a municipal road heading southeast, it passes through a heavily wooded section of the park before reaching its junction with the East Border Road in Malden. The roadway continues south from this junction as a connecting parkway. East Border Road East Border Road runs west from its junction with Summer Street, a Malden municipal street, through the intersection with Fellsway East, along the heavily wooded southern flank of the park, to a junction with Highland Avenue, a municipal street in Medford. A short stretch of Highland runs north along the park border to a circular intersection with Woodland Road and Elm Street; this stretch of Highland is not part of the National Register listing. Elm Street Elm Street continues to follow the southern flank of the park westward from the junction with Woodland Road and East Border Road, running west to a junction with Fellsway West. There is a parking area, with access to Wright's Pond, on this stretch of road. Fellsway West Fellsway West is partly a border parkway and partly internal; the border section of the parkway connects Elm Street to Roosevelt Circle. North of this junction only about of roadway are part of the original parkway design, having been extensively altered by the construction of I-93 along the same corridor. The internal section provides access to some centrally located reservation resources; the historic border section now consists of a one-way stretch of road that runs from the northeast side of Roosevelt Circle, while a modern one-way section runs south from the Elm Street junction, over I-93, to join Roosevelt Circle at the northwest, near the junction with South Border Road. Interior parkways The interior parkways (excluding portions of the border roads that run through parts of the reservation) are described roughly from east to west. Ravine Road Ravine Road is a relatively short () roadway connecting Woodland Road in the west to Fellsway East. The roadway is only wide, and is heavily forested on both sides. The ravine for which it is named contains Spot Pond Brook, and lies just to the north, but is not visible from the roadway. Woodland Road Woodland Road is one of the two major north-south parkways through the reservation. It is a four-lane roadway with a grassy median for most of its length, running south from South Street in Stoneham to a junction with Elm Street and Highland Avenue in Medford. Its major intersections are designed as small rotaries, and it provides access to the Spot Pond area, the visitor center at the John Bottume House, and the Metropolitan District Commission Pumping House. Fellsway West The interior reservation parkway portion of Fellsway West runs north from the junction with Elm Street in Medford to a junction with North Border Road and South Street in Stoneham. Because it has been significantly altered by the construction of adjacent I-93, most of this portion of parkway is not included in the National Register listing. The parkway provides access to the most centrally-located parking area of the reservation, the Lower Sheepfold lot.

It is a two-and-a-half story wood frame structure with asymmetrical massing typical of Queen Anne Victorian architecture. It has elaborate exterior and interior detailing. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Construction of the house began sometime between 1895 and 1898, and was completed by 1903. Colonel Adelbert Mossman (1848-1945), an American Civil War veteran of the 35th New Jersey Infantry Regiment, designed the house for himself.Town of Hudson History Mossman returned to Massachusetts after the war and in 1887 organized and led Hudson's first militia, the 5th Massachusetts Volunteers. Mossman was promoted to colonel while serving in this militia. In 1901 he was appointed sergeant-at-arms of the Massachusetts State House. While his house was being built Mossman also worked as a buyer for the Massachusetts Office of the Superintendent of Buildings, which likely facilitated his home's construction. Mossman died in 1945. Cecil W. Veinotte, a carpenter, and his wife Virginia M. Veinotte bought the house in 1946 and owned it until 1981. Dr. Bernard M. Flavhan, dentist, and wife Carol S. Flavhan purchased the home in 1981. Carol Flavhan became sole owner in 1984. She sold the house to the current owners in 1994. The house was added to National Register of Historic Places on September 30, 1982. Architecture The Col. Adelbert Mossman house is a well-preserved exemplar of Queen Anne style architecture and craft. It is located at 76 Park Street in Hudson across the street from Wood Park. The park and the Assabet River are visible from the house. The house's exterior is complex; typical for Queen Anne houses. Key exterior features include a tower capped by a conical roof, bay windows, high gables with decorative woodwork, carved brackets and moulding, and a wraparound porch with grouped turned columns and spindlework valances. The home contains 20 intricately detailed rooms. Interior architectural elements include pocket doors, non-rectilinear walls and ceilings, detailed mantels, an intricate main stair with gas lamps placed on top of carved newels, and Victorian woodwork detailing throughout. An original carriage house was replaced in 1952.

The interior includes well-preserved period details, including stencilwork by the itinerant artist Moses Eaton, Jr. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 25, 2003. Description and history It is located on the south side of Great Road (Massachusetts Routes 2A and 119), which is now predominantly commercial. It is a two-story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a hip roof, twin interior chimneys, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. Prominent features include the wide Doric pilasters at the corners, and the centered entrance, which is flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and entablature. The interior retains high-quality original woodwork, in the broad central hall and the front rooms. The main stairwell includes original and unrestored stencilwork by Moses Eaton, Jr. The house is notable as one of four built in Acton as the result of a lottery sponsored by Harvard College in 1794-95. The lottery was one of several run by the college to raise funds for the construction of buildings and acquisition of land. One of the grand prizes in this lottery was awarded to a ticket shared by four Acton residents, who divided the $10,000 prize, and each built a house. This house, built by Joseph Robbins, is the best-preserved of the four. The house was purchased by Lawrence Powers from the Nylander family and after extensive renovation is now the home of Powers Gallery. Visitors are welcome Tuesday Through Saturday 10-5:00.

Kadey-Krogen Yachts is a semi- custom builder and manufactures 10-15 yachts per year.Six models are currently offered, ranging in size from with new models on the drawing board. Defining aspects of the Kadey-Krogen trawler yacht are a pure full displacement hull, a fine forward entry, a wineglass transom, a fully covered aft deck which functions as the back porch, and high quality interior joinery predominantly in teak or cherry with other selections available. Their design enables the yachts to make ocean passages in comfort and safety. Owners of Kadey-Krogen trawler yachts have reported crossing the Atlantic,\\"Canadian Ambassadors,\\" PassageMaker Magazine, July/August 2010 Pacific and Indian oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea. Kadey-Krogen is headquartered in Stuart, Florida, with other offices in Annapolis, Portsmouth, RI and Seattle. Unlike the majority of boat manufacturers, the company does not use a dealership network, but instead works directly with customers. Since 1991 the company's boats have been built at a dedicated yard in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Kadey-Krogens are sold direct through an in-house sales team. Kadey-Krogen's yachts are often used as liveaboard vessels. According to company estimates, up to 75-percent of owners are part- or full-time liveaboards. While most owners have or are in the process of retiring, many continue to work and utilize their last few years working to take small trip and get acquainted with their boat and the lifestyle. History Based upon this design, the two incorporated as Kadey- Krogen Yachts and began to produce the Krogen 42‚Äô. Over the past 36 years Kadey-Krogen Yachts has designed and built 14 different models ranging from 36‚Äô ‚Äì 58‚Äô. Six different models are available as ‚Äúcurrent production‚Äù with several others on the drawing board. The company was founded in 1977 by Art Kadey and Jim Krogen. Art Kadey died in 1981 and Jim Krogen in December 1994. From 1995 until 2006 the company was owned by some of Jim‚Äôs children and their business partners. In 2006, ownership of the company was transferred to John Gear, Larry Polster, and Tom Button. Hull form All Kadey-Krogens are built using their exclusive Pure Full Displacement hull characterized by a moderate displacement-to-length ratio, a fine entry, and end-to-end symmetry including the signature ‚Äúwineglass‚Äù transom. The Pure Full Displacement hull is differentiated from other hulls based upon two form fundamentals: longitudinal symmetry and displacement to length ratio (D/L). Longitudinal symmetry refers to the degree to which the stern shape matches the bow shape. A barge is highly symmetrical and seaworthy but does not have ideal longitudinal symmetry and therefore is not very sea kindly. A hull with good symmetry will have V-shaped sections and sharp waterlines at both ends. There are four characteristics of a vessel with a symmetrical hull form. # A fine entry which contributes to wave cutting ability and less pounding in head seas. # A symmetrical form that has a fine stern tracks better in a following sea. Basic physics dictates that for every wave action force on the hull there is an equal and opposite reaction of force on the water. A V-shaped section aft will deflect a large portion of wave energy resulting in straighter tracking. A flatter hull shapes will direct nearly all of the wave force back vertically on the opposite side of the boat. Hull edges will dig in, much like a slalom water ski or snow ski, causing the boat to corkscrew through the water. # The aft V-shaped sections also offer less resistance and drag than the broad waterlines of asymmetrical hulls which results in better fuel economy. # Symmetrical forms roll less. The leverage (upward force) that wave action has on the flatter sections is greater than on a hull that is more tapered. The upward force on one side creates a downward force on the other side which is roll. The displacement-to-length ratio (D/L) indicates whether a given displacement is carried over a long waterline length or a short one. It reflects the load the vessel has to carry on a per-foot of waterline basis. Lower ratios tend towards lean and slippery forms with fine ends, and higher ratios tend towards full-bodied and less efficient forms with blunter ends. A lighter load per foot of waterline length results in better fuel economy and range. A vessel with a long waterline and low D/L (those in the 260-325 range) can be compared to a bank account earning compounded interest. Reducing D/L yields a more easily driven hull form thereby improving fuel economy and allowing for the use of smaller engines. The improved economy reduces the weight of fuel that must be carried for the desired range and the use of lower horsepower engines will reduce the weight of propulsion machinery. All this weight reduction now results in even greater fuel economy resulting in more weight savings resulting in even better economy, and so the benefits compound. To ensure that strength is not compromised by this weight savings approach, Kadey-Krogen uses massive stem-to-stern fiberglass girders that are closely spaced for effective distribution of hull loads to bulkheads, and encapsulated mahogany girder inserts that allow equipment to be attached for maximum strength and reliability. Cast lead (as opposed to iron) ballast conforms to the keel contour and is concentrated low in the hull so less ballast material is required and weight is reduced. Deckhouse and hull topsides are of cored laminates for reduced weight, lower center of gravity, thermal insulation and strength. Critical areas are reinforced with an impact-resistant fiberglass mat containing Twaron, which is the same fiber used to give body armor \\"bullet-proof\\" capability. Twaron is an aramid fiber that is five times stronger than steel and up to 60% lighter than ballistic steel. Kadey-Krogen is the only builder of trawlers who provides this level of hull reinforcement.

In the Black: A History of African Americans on Wall Street. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 2002. Ambassador Doley left the firm in 2003, taking emeritus status. Career In 1973, Ambassador Doley bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and is the only African American to have owned a seat (there are no longer NYSE individual memberships). He operated his membership as a Floor Broker, executing orders for other members and member firms on the floor of the NYSE. Ambassador Doley began his professional career in investment banking in 1968. He served as Vice President with major Wall Street firms prior to buying his own seat. He serviced institutional accounts of banks, insurance companies, and universities with portfolios totaling over $500 million. During this period, Ambassador Doley also affected and counseled on a number of mergers and acquisitions of life insurance companies. Ambassador Doley was the Co-Founder of the U.S.-Africa Chamber of Commerce. He chaired the investment committee of Southern Africa Enterprise Development Fund's (SAEDF) private equity fund and placed the first black market maker on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Over the years, he's advised African stock exchanges and the regulatory bodies of those stock exchanges. Ambassador Doley was honored by his industry peers as an Outstanding Broker of the Year in 1971. The Dow Jones Wall Street Journal selected him as Stock Picker of the Year in 1990. Ambassador Ambassador Doley was accorded ambassadorial rank while serving as United States Representative to the African Development Bank and Fund (AfDB), from 1983 to 1985, once the U.S. became a stockholder in the bank. The AfDB, headquartered in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is a development finance institution owned by the governments of 50 African and 25 non-African countries, with 800 employees, and assets of $50 billion. Ambassador Doley crafted and conveyed U.S. Government positions regarding AfDB financial proposals and policies. While at the African Development Bank and Fund, Ambassador Doley participated in the first $100 million private placement for Africa. Upon returning to the private sector, he was the lead banker for the first $100 million U.S. medium-term notes for the African Development Bank and Fund, a 30-year bond (sold to TIAA-CREF). The AfDB was able to quadruple its capital by using Ambassador Doley's capital increase formula. While serving as United States Executive Director to the AfDB, Ambassador Doley worked with the Vice President of Finance in securing a AAA rating from the global financial rating agencies, the first AAA rating for an African-based entity, and to more than tripling its authorized capital. Ambassador Doley worked with African Heads of State and Ministers involved with commerce, finance, and international trade and development. In 1982 Ambassador Doley was appointed the Founding Director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS) at the U.S. Department of Interior. Ambassador Doley managed MMS, an organization of more than 5,000 employees and a budget of $1.2 billion, and its collection of $12 billion in income due the United States Treasury. This represented the second largest income source to the U.S. Government. Mr. Doley had prior experience in this realm, having served in 1980 as a Board Member of the Louisiana State Mineral Board, a gubernatorial appointment. Additional community and public service Ambassador Doley has an extensive track record of community and public service, primarily focusing on education. He has been an appointee in five Republican Administrations. Early in the 21st century, Doley was appointed by then-President George W. Bush to the President's Board of Advisors Commission on Historically Black Colleges and Universities. From 1970 to 1977 Ambassador Doley was an instructor at Southern University in New Orleans, teaching one course per semester in Economics, Business Structure, or Money and Banking. His board-of-directors affiliations reflect keen interest in education and his commitment to sustainable development in Africa. As a New York Stock Exchange member, Ambassador Doley hosted both President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and President Festus Mogae of Botswana for the ringing of the closing bell, the first two African heads of state to have such a distinction. At the request of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, a religious order founded by St. Katharine Drexel, Ambassador Doley underwrote the travel of one dozen nuns for St. Katharine Drexel's canonization by the Vatican in 2000. He also provided the transportation to Native Americans who were alumni of schools founded by St. Katharine Drexel on Native American reservations. The Doley Family was honored in a special mass during St. Louis Cathedral's designation to Basilica (New Orleans, 1997) for their contributions. The Doley Family provided the Papal symbols of canopeum and tintinnabulum, necessary to meet the requirements of a Basilica. A sculpture dedicated in the St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 honors the Doley Family and its heritage in New Orleans, which dates back to August, 1720. Archbishop Alfred C. Hughes of New Orleans blessed the sculpture at a special ceremony with the family in 2008. Ambassador Doley is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Africa (Further involvements) In 1977, Ambassador Doley commissioned a report on the platinum industry of South Africa. The conclusion was that the apartheid system rendered platinum, and other strategic resources, an unreliable source for the U.S. This report was reviewed in the Wall Street Journal and resulted in Ambassador Doley being the special guest on Wall $treet Week with Louis Rukeyser on PBS in 1977. Ambassador Doley challenged Wall Street for its recommendation of De Beers stock during the period of sanctions against South Africa. This resulted in the buy recommendation of De Beers being removed. During the 1980s, Ambassador Doley consulted with the stock exchanges of Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, and Zambia. Ambassador Doley played a role in the negotiations for peace in the Angolan Civil War.

Biography He was born at Kitzingen, Bavaria, the son of a fisherman, attended school in Kitzingen, and from 1709 to 1715 studied at the Jesuit College at W√ºrzburg. In 1715 he entered the seminary of the latter city and in 1721 was ordained priest. Christopher von Hutten, Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, sent him, in 1725, to Rome to study ecclesiastical law under Prosper Lambertini, later Pope Benedict XIV. Barthel returned as Doctor Utriusque Juris, in 1727, to W√ºrzburg, where he became president of the seminary and (1728) professor of canon law at the university. Other ecclesiastical and academical honours, among them the vice-chancellorship of the university (1754), were conferred upon him. He took an active part in settling the controversy occasioned by the erection of the new Diocese of Fulda (1752). As a teacher, he was appreciated by both Catholics and Protestants, and his lectures were circulated at various schools. He broke with the traditional method in canonical science, being one of the first to adopt the historico- critical treatment in Germany. His efforts to distinguish between the essentials and non-essentials in Catholic doctrines, and his attribution of excessive power to the State in its relations with the Church caused his opinions to be denounced at Rome as unorthodox. Any belief that Barthel was a Jesuit is mistaken (see http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz2142.html). Works In his \\"Promemoria\\" (1751) he submitted his views and method to his former teacher, Benedict XIV, and obtained a favourable decision. His works, apart from what was written in the Fulda controversy, as \\"De Pallio\\" (1753), deal principally with the relations between Church and State, especially in Germany. Several of them are found in the \\"Opuscula juridica varii argumenti\\" (W√ºrzburg, 1765, 1771).

Built in 1927-28, it is the last great summer estate house to be built in Weston, and one of about a dozen that survive. It was built for Edward Peirce, a businessman in the wool trade. It was for many years a conference center of Northeastern University, but is now in private ownership. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The Henderson House stands in a residential area of southern Weston, on the west side of Westcliff Road. It is set on a knoll from which expansive views in all directions, but particularly to the south, are possible. It is a large 2-1/2 story structure, its foundation and first floor built of stone, and the upper levels finished in stone as well has half-timbered stucco in the Tudor Revival style. The woodwork on the upper levels has elaborate decorative elements, each gable and window group receiving slightly different treatment. A stone porte-cochere projects over the circular drive in front of the main entrance, which features a heavy wooden door. The interior public spaces are richly decorated in woodwork, ironwork, and stone. The house was built in 1927‚Äì28, on the site of an earlier Tudor house that burned in 1925. It was the centerpiece of a large country estate (more than spanning the Weston-Wellesley line) of Edward Peirce, the owner, made a fortune in the wool business. The design was by Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch & Abbott, and may have reused portions of the previous estate house or its foundations. The estate also originally had a number of outbuildings, of which two have survived in altered forms as parts of nearby houses built on the former estate. The property passed into the hands of Roger Babson, before a nearly six-acre parcel was donated to Northeastern University by one of its trustees, Ernest Henderson. The school used the property as part of its continuing education programs and as a conference center. The house is the last surviving grand Tudor mansion of several that were once in Weston. The residence was closed for event functions as of December 31, 2014 and is currently scheduled to be auctioned from June 26-June 29th by Concierge Auctions.

Nicknamed Babby as he was the youngest of 11 and born in Dublin, he joined Shamrock Rovers in 1926 and had four spells at Glenmalure Park. He also played for Bradford City, Shelbourne, Sheffield United, Manchester United, Coleraine, Glentoran and Larne. Byrne won three senior caps for the Irish Free State making a scoring debut as a Shels player on 20 April 1929 in a 4‚Äì0 friendly win against Belgium at Dalymount Park. As a Rovers player he played against Spain at the same venue on 13 December 1931. His last cap was as a Coleraine player in a World Cup qualifier against Belgium, also at Dalymount, on 25 February 1934. He was top scorer in the League with 17 goals when Rovers went unbeaten capturing their third League Championship in 1926‚Äì27. This was his and the club's first season at Glenmalure Park. He was Rovers' top scorer the following season and in his second spell in 1929‚Äì30 and 1930‚Äì31. In between, he had a spell with Shelbourne where he again finished top scorer with 15 goals in their second League winning season. He won four FAI Cup medals in a row scoring in the finals in 1930, the 1931 replay, the 1933 final and replay. In all he scored 85 League and 13 FAI Cup goals for the Hoops. He is the sixth-highest goalscorer in Rovers' history. He was the last surviving member of the 1931‚Äì32 double winners. He was also the first League of Ireland player to transfer to Manchester United and the first League of Ireland player to score 100 league goals. He transferred to Sheffield United in October 1932. Despite impressing he was released due to economic pressures and returned to Milltown the following month. He joined Manchester United in September 1933 with fellow Irish player Billy Behan ‚Äì the pair were the club's first Irish players for more than a decade. He scored on his debut for Manchester United on 21 October 1933 and scored a total of three goals in four league appearances. He also scored on his debut for Bradford City. Byrne is the only player to be capped for Ireland while playing for Shamrock Rovers and Shelbourne. He was surprisingly small (5 feet 5 inches in height) in an era of big centre forwards, yet he was a prolific goalscorer. He was fast, effective in the air as well as on the ground, and forced goalkeepers to make mistakes.

It is named for its discoverer, Tullio Levi-Civita. Like a parallelogram, two opposite sides AA‚Ä≤ and BB‚Ä≤ of a parallelogramoid are parallel (via parallel transport side AB) and the same length as each other, but the fourth side A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ will not in general be parallel to or the same length as the side AB, although it will be straight (a geodesic). Construction A parallelogram in Euclidean geometry can be constructed as follows: * Start with a straight line segment AB and another straight line segment AA‚Ä≤. * Slide the segment AA‚Ä≤ along AB to the endpoint B, keeping the angle with AB constant, and remaining in the same plane as the points A, A‚Ä≤, and B. * Label the endpoint of the resulting segment B‚Ä≤ so that the segment is BB‚Ä≤. * Draw a straight line A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤. In a curved space, such as a Riemannian manifold or more generally any manifold equipped with an affine connection, the notion of \\"straight line\\" generalizes to that of a geodesic. In a suitable neighborhood (such as a ball in a normal coordinate system), any two points can be joined by a geodesic. The idea of sliding the one straight line along the other gives way to the more general notion of parallel transport. Thus, assuming either that the manifold is complete, or that the construction is taking place in a suitable neighborhood, the steps to producing a Levi-Civita parallelogram are: * Start with a geodesic AB and another geodesic AA‚Ä≤. These geodesics are assumed to be parameterized by their arclength in the case of a Riemannian manifold, or to carry a choice of affine parameter in the general case of an affine connection. * \\"Slide\\" (parallel transport) the tangent vector of AA‚Ä≤ from A to B. * The resulting tangent vector at B generates a geodesic via the exponential map. Label the endpoint of this geodesic by B‚Ä≤, and the geodesic itself BB‚Ä≤. * Connect the points A‚Ä≤ and B‚Ä≤ by the geodesic A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤. Quantifying the difference from a parallelogram The length of this last geodesic constructed connecting the remaining points A‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ may in general be different than the length of the base AB. This difference is measured by the Riemann curvature tensor. To state the relationship precisely, let AA‚Ä≤ be the exponential of a tangent vector X at A, and AB the exponential of a tangent vector Y at A. Then :A'B'^2 = AB^2 + \\\\frac{8}{3}\\\\langle R(X,Y)X,Y\\\\rangle + \\\\text{higher order terms} where terms of higher order in the length of the sides of the parallelogram have been suppressed. Discrete approximation Two rungs of Schild's ladder. The segments A1X1 and A2X2 are an approximation to first order of the parallel transport of A0X0 along the curve. Parallel transport can be discretely approximated by Schild's ladder, which approximates Levi-Civita parallelogramoids by approximate parallelograms.

Knockout rats can mimic human diseases and are important tools for studying gene function (functional genomics) and for drug discovery and development. The production of knockout rats was not economically or technically feasible until 2008.Abbott A: Laboratory animals: the Renaissance rat.

Technology developed through funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and work accomplished by the members of the Knock Out Rat Consortium (KORC) led to cost-effective methods to create knockout rats. The importance of developing the rat as a more versatile tool for human health research is evidenced by the $120 million investment made by the NIH via the Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium, resulting in the draft sequence of a laboratory strain of the brown or Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus).Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium, Genome sequence of the brown rat yields insights into mammalian evolution.

Both mice and rats are relatively small, easily handled, have a short generation time, and are genetically inbred. While mice have proven to be a useful rodent model and techniques have been developed for routine disruption of their genes, in many circumstances rats are considered a superior laboratory animal for studying and modeling human disease. Rats are physiologically more similar to humans than are mice. For example, rats have a heart rate more similar to that of humans, while mice have a heart rate five to ten times as fast. It is widely believed that the rat is a better model than the mouse for human cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, and many autoimmune, neurological, behavioral, and addiction disorders.Abbott, A., Laboratory animals: the Renaissance rat. Nature, 2004. 428(6982): p. 464-6. In addition, rat models are superior to mouse models for testing the pharmacodynamics and toxicity of potential therapeutic compounds, partially because the number and type of many of their detoxifying enzymes are very similar to those in humans.Lindblad-Toh, K., Genome sequencing: three's company. Nature, 2004. 428(6982): p. 475-6. Their larger size makes rats more conducive to study by instrumentation, and also facilitates manipulation such as blood sampling, nerve conduction, and performing surgeries. Techniques for genetic manipulation are available in the mouse, which is commonly used to model human disease. Although published knockouts exist for approximately 60%Zambrowicz, 1998; Skarnes et al., 2004; To et al., 2004; Nord et al., 2006 of mouse genes, a large majority of common human diseases do not have a knockout mouse model. Knockout rat models are an alternative to mice that may enable the creation of new gene disruptions that are unavailable in the mouse. Knockout rat models can also complement existing transgenic mouse models. Comparing mouse and rat mutants can facilitate the distinction between rodent- specific and general mammalian phenotypes. Production challenges Rat models have been used to advance many areas of medical research, including cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders (studies of behavioral intervention and addiction), neural regeneration, diabetes, transplantation, autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis), cancer, and wound & bone healing. While the completion of the rat genome sequence provides very key information, how these diseases relate to gene function requires an efficient method to create knockout rat models in which specific genomic sequences are manipulated. Most techniques for genetic manipulation, including random mutagenesis with a gene trap (retroviral-based and non-retroviral-based), gene knock-outs/knock-ins, and conditional mutations, depend upon the culture and manipulation of embryonic stem (ES) cells.Cohen-Tannoudji, M. and C. Babinet, Beyond 'knock-out' mice: new perspectives for the programmed modification of the mammalian genome. Molecular Human Reproduction, 1998. 4(10): p. 929-38. Rat ES cells were only recently isolated and no demonstration of gene modification in them has been reported. Consequently, many genetic manipulation techniques widely used in the mouse are not possible in the rat. Early methods Until the commercial development of mobile DNA technology in 2007 and zinc-finger nuclease technology in 2009, there were only two technologies that could be used to produce rat models of human disease: cloning and chemical mutagenesis using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Although cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) could theoretically be used to create rats with specific mutations by mutating somatic cells, and then using these cells for SCNT, this approach has not been used successfully to create knockout rats. One problem with this strategy is that SCNT is extremely inefficient. The first published attempt had a success rate of less than 1%.Zhou, Q., J.P. Renard, G. Le Friec, V. Brochard, N. Beaujean, Y. Cherifi, A. Fraichard, and J. Cozzi, Generation of fertile cloned rats by regulating oocyte activation. Science, 2003. 302(5648): p. 1179. Alternatively, ENU mutagenesis is a common random mutagenesis gene knockout strategy in the mouse that can also be used in the rat. ENU mutagenesis involves using a chemical, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), to create single base changes in the genome. ENU transfers its ethyl group to oxygen or nitrogen radicals in DNA, resulting in mis-pairing and base pair substitution. Mutant animals can be produced by injecting a male mouse with ENU, and breeding with a wild type female to produce mutant offspring. ENU mutagenesis creates a high frequency of random mutations, with approximately one base pair change in any given gene in every 200-700 gametes.Hitotsumachi, S., D.A. Carpenter, and W.L. Russell, Dose- repetition increases the mutagenic effectiveness of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in mouse spermatogonia. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 1985. 82(19): p. 6619-21. Despite its high mutagenicity, the physical penetration of ENU is limited and only about 500 genes are mutated for each male and a very small number of the total mutations have an observable phenotype. Thousands of mutations typically need to be created in a single animal in order to generate one novel phenotype. Despite recent improvements in ENU technology,Brown, S.D. and R.E. Hardisty, Mutagenesis strategies for identifying novel loci associated with disease phenotypes. Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology, 2003. 14(1): p. 19-24.Chen, Y., D. Yee, K. Dains, A. Chatterjee, J. Cavalcoli, E. Schneider, J. Om, R.P. Woychik, and T. Magnuson, Genotype-based screen for ENU-induced mutations in mouse embryonic stem cells. Nature Genetics, 2000. 24(3): p. 314-7.Zan, Y., J.D. Haag, K.S. Chen, L.A. Shepel, D. Wigington, Y.R. Wang, R. Hu, C.C. Lopez-Guajardo, H.L. Brose, K.I. Porter, R.A. Leonard, A.A. Hitt, S.L. Schommer, A.F. Elegbede, and M.N. Gould, Production of knockout rats using ENU mutagenesis and a yeast-based screening assay. Nature Biotechnology, 2003. 21(6): p. 645-51. mapping mutations responsible for a particular phenotype is typically difficult and time-consuming. Neutral mutations must be separated from causative mutations, via extensive breeding. ENU and cloning methods are simply inefficient for creating and mapping gene knockouts in rats for the creation of new models of human disease. Through 2007, the largest rat ENU mutagenesis project to date run by the Medical College of Wisconsin was able to produce only 9 knockout rat lines in a period of five years at an average cost of $200,000 per knockout line. Although some companies are still pursuing this strategy, the Medical College of Wisconsin has switched to a more efficient and commercially viable method using mobile DNA and CompoZr ZFN technology. Zinc-finger and TALE nuclease technology Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) are engineered DNA-binding proteins that facilitate targeted editing of the genome by creating double-strand breaks in DNA at user-specified locations. Double strand breaks are important for site-specific mutagenesis in that they stimulate the cell‚Äôs natural DNA-repair processes, namely homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. When the cell uses the non- homologous end joining pathway to repair the double-strand break, the inherent inaccuracy of the repair often generates precisely targeted mutations. This results in embryos with targeted gene knockout.Tesson et al., Knockout rats generated by embryo microinjection of TALENs. Nature Biotechnology Vol 29:695-96 (5 August 2011) Standard microinjection techniques allow this technology to make knockout rats in 4‚Äì6 months. A major advantage of ZFN- and TALEN-mediated gene knockout relative to the use of mobile DNA is that a particular gene can be uniquely and specifically targeted for knockout. In contrast, knockouts made using mobile DNA technology are random and are therefore unlikely to target the gene of interest. Mobile DNA technology Mobile DNA (jumping gene) technology uses retrotransposons and transposons for the production of knockout rat models. This platform technology meets all of the criteria for a successful gene knockout approach in mammals by permitting random mutagenesis directly in the germ cells (sperm and oocytes) of mammalian model organisms, including rats. Using this technology, genes are disrupted completely and in a stable manner, are knocked out at a high frequency, and are randomly disrupted throughout the entire genome. The genomic location of mutations can be easily mapped, creating a library of knockout rats for later use. Once the random knockout mutations are created, more refined mutations such as conditional mutations can be created by breeding knockout lines with rat lines expressing CRE recombinase in a tissue specific manner. Knock-ins can be produced by recombination mediated cassette exchange. piggyBac (PB) DNA transposons piggyBac transposon technology piggyBac (PB) DNA transposons mobilize via a \\"cut-and-paste\\" mechanism whereby a transposase enzyme (PB transposase), encoded by the transposon itself, excises and re-integrates the transposon at other sites within the genome. PB transposase specifically recognizes PB inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the transposon; it binds to these sequences and catalyzes excision of the transposon. PB then integrates at TTAA sitesFraser, M.J., et al., Precise excision of TTAA- specific lepidopteran transposons piggyBac (IFP2) and tagalong (TFP3) from the baculovirus genome in cell lines from two species of Lepidoptera. Insect Mol Biol, 1996. 5(2): p. 141-51. throughout the genome, in a relatively random fashion. For the creation of gene trap mutations (or adapted for generating transgenic animals), the transposase is supplied in trans on one plasmid and is co-transfected with a plasmid containing donor transposon, a recombinant transposon comprising a gene trap flanked by the binding sites for the transposase (ITRs). The transposase will catalyze the excision of the transposon from the plasmid and subsequent integration into the genome. Integration within a coding region will capture the elements necessary for gene trap expression. PB possesses several ideal properties: (1) it preferentially inserts within genes (50 to 67% of insertions hit genes) (2) it exhibits no local hopping (widespread genomic coverage) (3) it is not sensitive to over-production inhibition in which elevated levels of the transposase cause decreased transposition 4) it excises cleanly from a donor site, leaving no ‚Äúfootprint,‚Äù unlike Sleeping Beauty.Mitra, R., J. Fain- Thornton, and N.L. Craig, piggyBac can bypass DNA synthesis during cut and paste transposition. EMBO J, 2008.Ding, S., et al., Efficient transposition of the piggyBac (PB) transposon in mammalian cells and mice. Cell, 2005. 122(3): p. 473-83. Sleeping beauty (SB) transposons Sleeping Beauty transposon technology The sleeping beauty (SB) transposon is a derivative of the Tc1/mariner superfamily of DNA transposons prevalent among both vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. However, endogenous DNA transposons from this family are completely inactive in vertebrate genomes. An active Tc1/mariner transposon, synthesized from alignment of inactive transposons from the salmonid subfamily of elements, was ‚Äúawoken‚Äù to form the transposon named Sleeping Beauty.Ivics, Z., et al., Molecular reconstruction of Sleeping Beauty, a Tc1-like transposon from fish, and its transposition in human cells. Cell, 1997. 91(4): p. 501-10. SB, like other DNA transposons, mobilizes itself via a cut-and-paste mechanism whereby a transposase enzyme, encoded by the transposon itself, excises and re-integrates the transposon at other sites within the genome. The 340 amino acid SB protein recognizes inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) that flank the transposon; it binds to these sequences and catalyzes excision of the transposon. SB then integrates into random sites within the genome, although some studies report very slight preferences for transcriptional units.Vigdal, T.J., et al., Common physical properties of DNA affecting target site selection of sleeping beauty and other Tc1/mariner transposable elements. J Mol Biol, 2002. 323(3): p. 441-52. Yant, S.R., et al., High-resolution genome- wide mapping of transposon integration in mammals. Mol Cell Biol, 2005. 25(6): p. 2085-94. There is also a simple requirement of a TA-dinucleotide at the target site, like all Tc1/mariner transposons.Plasterk, R.H., Z. Izsvak, and Z. Ivics, Resident aliens: the Tc1/mariner superfamily of transposable elements. Trends Genet, 1999. 15(8): p. 326-32. The SB transposon is a powerful tool for insertional mutagenesis in many vertebrate species. It recently exhibited especial utility for germ line mutagenesis in both mice and rats.Geurts, A.M., et al., Gene mutations and genomic rearrangements in the mouse as a result of transposon mobilization from chromosomal concatemers. PLoS Genet, 2006. 2(9): p. e156.Horie, K., et al., Characterization of Sleeping Beauty transposition and its application to genetic screening in mice.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2002. 99(7): p. 4495-9. There are several advantages that make SB a highly attractive mutagen geared toward gene discovery: 1) it has little bias for inserting within particular genomic regions or within specific recognition sequences, 2) de novo insertions of the transposon provide a ‚Äútagged‚Äù sequence marker for rapid identification of the specific mutation by simple PCR cloning methods, 3) in vivo SB insertional mutagenesis allows multiple mutations to be quickly and easily generated in a single animal, and in a single tissue, such as an adenomatous polyp. LINE1 (L1) retrotransposons L1 retrotransposon technology Transposons and retrotransposons are valuable tools for unbiased gene discovery as mobile pieces of DNA used for gene disruption. Retrotransposons, such as LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), mobilize via a ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù mechanism and are abundant in many eukaryotic species. Several L1 retrotransposons have remained active in mice and humans. L1s contain a small internal promoter within a 5‚Äô untranslated region to drive expression, two open reading frames (ORFs), and a 3‚Äô untranslated region containing sequences for polyadenylation. The two ORFs encode proteins necessary for autonomous retrotransposition; ORF1 encodes an RNA-binding protein while ORF2 encodes a protein containing endonuclease (EN) and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, which nick a site in DNA, then produce a copy via RT. These proteins exhibit an overwhelming specificity for binding to and acting on the transcript that encodes them, enabling near exclusive mobilization of the parental L1 RNA. Using the RT activity of the ORF2 protein, the transcribed L1 RNA is copied into DNA by a process termed target primed reverse transcription (TPRT),Luan, D.D., M.H. Korman, J.L. Jakubczak, and T.H. Eickbush, Reverse transcription of R2Bm RNA is primed by a nick at the chromosomal target site: a mechanism for non-LTR retrotransposition. Cell, 1993. 72(4): p. 595-605. and integrated into the genome. Integration occurs with little bias for any particular genomic region, requiring a simple consensus sequence, 5‚ÄôTTTT‚ÄôA-3‚Äô (along with minor variations of this sequence). Integrated L1 sequences are often truncated at the 5‚Äô end, with an average total size of 1 Kb, many containing only 3‚Äô terminal sequences. The nature of retrotransposition endows the L1 with some unique advantages; L1 retrotransposons have an essentially unlimited supply of the insertional mutagen since it is continually transcribed from a promoter, which would be useful for applications where large numbers of mutations are needed in a single cell. L1 elements also demonstrate widespread genomic coverage, with a largely random distribution of insertions.Ostertag, E.M., et al., A mouse model of human L1 retrotransposition. Nat Genet, 2002. 32(4): p. 655-60.Babushok, D.V., et al., L1 integration in a transgenic mouse model. Genome Res, 2006. 16(2): p. 240-50.Cost, G.J. and J.D. Boeke, Targeting of human retrotransposon integration is directed by the specificity of the L1 endonuclease for regions of unusual DNA structure. Biochemistry, 1998. 37(51): p. 18081-93. L1 insertions at genomic sites are also irreversible, and thus any mutagenic event caused by an L1 insertion is ‚Äútagged‚Äù by L1 sequences.

House of Abe Abe no Masahiro Masahiro is the protagonist in the series. He is an Onmy≈çji in training and the grandson of the legendary Abe no Seimei. When he was young, Masahiro's spiritual sight was so strong that Seimei temporarily sealed it away until he was old enough to properly use it. After meeting Mokkun, Masahiro regained his spirit sight and embraced his destiny as an Onmy≈çji in service to the emperor. He is friendly and kind to both y≈çkai and people whom he seeks to protect from evil demons that had taken up residence surrounding the imperial capital. Although he is sometimes cocky and clumsy, there are moments when he utilizes powers beyond those of a mere apprentice, which is why Seimei claims he is the only one who can succeed him. Masahiro greatly resents being known only as and trains hard to surpass his grandfather. He has two older brothers whom both are married and have families of their own. Narachika is the eldest in the family. His second older brother, Masachika is ten years older than he is. According to Ten‚Äôitsu, children in the Abe residence were often taken care by the twelve Shinsh≈ç. It was seen through flashbacks in the anime that Masahiro was taken care by Guren. In addition to his magic, Masahiro later receives a sword called the G≈çma no Tsurugi, a sword which was forged by Seimei which previously belonged to Suzaku. He was also given by Takao no Kami, flames that has the power to kill gods, in order to destroy the corrupted Guren. In addition, he erased Guren's memories that are about him, meaning that Guren will never remember the time when he met Masahiro in the form of a mononoke or the time when they were fighting demons together. He cares a lot about his friends, his family and his love, Fujiwara no Akiko whom he vows to protect no matter what. Abe no Masahiro (left) and Guren (right) Abe no Seimei The greatest onmy≈çji in the history of Japan, Abe no Seimei is the grandfather of Masahiro. He is in his 80s and he has twelve shikigami called the Shinsh≈ç whom he calls his friends under his command and is able to protect his soul, which takes the form of his younger self, outside of his body in order to aid Masahiro in combat. However, by doing so leaves his body defenceless if an enemy attacks. He constantly needles Masahiro to push him further in his journey as a sort of reverse psychology, which causes Masahiro to refer to Seimei as a \\"tanuki\\" or raccoon dog. Rumour has it that Seimei's mother was not human but a powerful fox spirit, which may explain why he is so powerful. Despite showing such a happy attitude, there were two moments of his life that he was sad, the first when he could not save his only best friend, Ry≈´sai and secondly the death of his wife, Wakana whom he loved deeply. The character is loosely based on a real person of the same name. Abe no Wakana Wakana is Seimei's wife and Yoshimasa's mother. She died when Yoshimasa was only two years old due to an illness. Although she died a long time ago, her spirit has not crossed to the other side. During the final episode, Masahiro, ready to cross over to the other side, meets and talks to her in the spirit world, not realizing that she is his grandmother. She invites Masahiro to sit beside her and tells him that she has not crossed to the other side just yet because her lover has not come. This reminds Masahiro of the person that is precious to him and he decides to return to the world of the living. Abe no Yoshimasa Yoshimasa is Masahiro's father and Seimei's youngest son. He is married to Tsuyuki and has three sons: Narichika, Masachika and Masahiro. He has a doctorate in stargazing and is a prominent figure in the onmy≈ç world. However, he is not as powerful as Seimei or Masahiro (after he realizes his potential). Yoshimasa realizes that Masahiro is the true heir to Seimei, as acknowledged by Guren, as he is the only one not afraid of his aura. He is a kind and supportive father who turns a blind eye to Masahiro's nightly escapades to fight demons and makes up excuses for him at the onmy≈ç dorms. Abe no Tsuyuki Tsuyuki is Yoshimasa's wife and Masahiro's mother. She knows about Masahiro fighting demons at night but does not say anything to him because she wants him to tell her personally. Later in series, Tsuyuki also teaches Akiko things that girls her age do, such as going shopping in the market and sewing. She knows Yoshimasa very well; she could tell that he is worried about Masahiro going to Izumo to kill the corrupted Guren even when he does not tell her. Yoshimasa even went as far to say that the thought on how well Tsuyuki understand himself frightens him. Abe no Narichika Narachika is Yoshimasa's eldest son and Masahiro's oldest brother. He has an easygoing personality and is, personality wise out of the three brothers, most similar to Seimei. He married into his wife's family and has two sons and a one-year-old daughter named K≈çhime, . Narichika has a doctorate in calendar and date studies, making him a highly recognized figure in the dorm. He cares for his family and Masahiro a lot. House of Fujiwara Fujiwara no Akiko Akiko is an imperial princess and the daughter of the minister of the left. She and Masahiro first meet in the Imperial Palace after his coming of age ceremony and the two become good friends after he saves her from a demon attack. As the series progresses, both of them fall in love with each other. Akiko is special, as she possesses the Kenki ability (the ability to see demons). Moreover, because of this, during the beginning of the series, the foreign demons constantly attack her to deliver Akiko as a sacrifice to their master. They manage to capture her but Masahiro and his allies were able to save her, but not before the demons gave a curse wound on her hand. Halfway through the series, Akiko's father attempted to introduce her into the imperial court as a wife for the Emperor, thereby separating her from Masahiro forever. In her moment of sadness, Ky≈´ki was able to put a powerful curse through her wounded hand. While the curse was eventually removed, according to Seimei the after-effects of the curse were so serious to Akiko that an onmy≈çji was required keep the curse from overwhelming her. As a result, she was not sent to imperial court -as that would bring bad luck to the Emperor- so her half-sister Sh≈çko, who looks the same as her, was sent into the palace in her place. Akiko was instead sent to live with Seimei's family to deal with the curse under the identity as distant relative of theirs. (There are suggestions that Seimei tricked Akiko's father into thinking that so she and Masahiro could remain close, since he knows about their feelings for each other. However, it is also revealed Seimei was having difficulty in finding an auspicious date to send Akiko to court.) It should be also noted that her Kenki ability is stronger than both Seimei and Masahiro because she was able to see a spirit that was possessing Masahiro while neither Masahiro nor Seimei could. At the Abe residence, Akiko remains a strong help to Masahiro and helps around the house, learning to do things what an ordinary girl does, like going shopping by herself thanks to the help of Tsuyuki, Masahiro's mother. During the middle of the series (episode 10), Masahiro promises Akiko that he will show her fireflies at Kifune mountain next year at summer time. In the final episode of the anime, he is shown fulfilling his promise. Fujiwara no Yukinari Yukinari is the minister of the right to the Emperor, whose primary duty is the management and upkeep the imperial capital. Yukinari takes a liking to Masahiro from the moment they meet, and constantly encourages him to advance in his studies because he knows he will be a powerful onmy≈çji like Seimei, which of course promotes a high amount of jealousy among Masahiro's peers in the Onmy≈ç dorms. Seimei helped him long ago and because of this Yukinari offered to be Masahiro's guardian at his coming of age ceremony in return. During the series, he was cursed by a vengeful spirit who had mistaken him for his grandfather, but the spirit was later exorcised thanks to Masahiro. He also seems to be aware of Masahiro's activities in fighting demons. Fujiwara no Toshitsugu Toshitsugu is two years Masahiro's senior; he works at the Onmy≈ç dorms with him. He is a diligent worker who values effort and hard work above all else. He has a nickname, He was the first person who talked to Masahiro but after a misunderstanding of seeing Masahiro at night when he was supposed to be at home on rest. Toshitsugu's attitude became harsh and critical, saying he should not do as he wishes just because of his family's influence. Toshitsugu shows promise as an onmy≈çji by \\"normal\\" standards (not compared to Seimei or Masahiro). He does not know of Masahiro's power, but gets suspicious after a cloaked Masahiro saved him. He was possessed by a vengeful spirit summoned by Kazane in the Kazane arc and placed a curse on Yukinari who had taken care of him since he was young. Masahiro eventually breaks the curse where he had no memory of the incident. The Twelve Shinsh≈ç The twelve Shinsh≈ç have been in existence for a very, very long time and can be considered lower rank gods. In the series, they serve Abe no Seimei, the greatest onmy≈çji of all time. Unless Seimei summons them, they usually reside in the spirit world of the Gods. Takao no Kami, the goddess of Kifune Mountain, tells Masahiro that the twelve Shinsh≈ç are special as they were actually created by peoples' dreams. Over time, peoples' dreams and imagination were transformed into the twelve Shinsh≈ç, giving them unique forms and personalities. As such, they can be considered to be the 'children' of humans. As a result, they are forbidden from harming, let alone killing, humans. If they break this rule, they will lose their souls and become demons. Although they are gods who possess strong powers, they can be injured, feel pain and lose their lives. When one of them dies, they will be reborn instantly, as people's dreams never stop giving them their form, but they will forget their past self and continue on as a completely different personality. Mokkun/Guren/T≈çda , Guren is one of twelve Shinsh≈ç in service to Seimei, who gave him his current name, after he pledged his servitude. His original name is T≈çda, and the other Shinsh≈ç still address him by this name. Only Seimei and Masahiro call him Guren. When in Masahiro's company, Guren usually takes the form of an ayakashi, although Masahiro considers him to be a mononoke and calls him Mokkun when in that form. Because he's invisible to anyone without a spirit sense, Mokkun frequently plays tricks on people who annoy him, much to Masahiro's chagrin. It was also shown in the anime that Guren dislikes babies, because according to him, babies often cry for no reason. However, Masahiro disagrees, saying that Guren was merely afraid that the children who see him will hate him. Guren watched over and protected Masahiro from the time he was a baby because Masahiro was the only person who was not afraid of him. Because of this, and despite how they constantly bicker with each other, Masahiro and Guren share a deep sense of friendship and trust and both are willing to lay down their own lives for the other. It is also mentioned that Guren is one of the most feared summon gods, possessing the power of controlling the fires of Hell. Seimei created a golden fillet that Guren wears and which prevents his own strength from overwhelming him. In the form of Mokkun, the familiar is able to erect barriers and project crescent shaped blades of energy; in the form of Guren, he attacks with blasts of fire and a trident. Seimei cites the fact that Masahiro does not fear Guren as proof that his grandson is the only one fit to be his successor. In the past, Seimei's best friend, Ry≈´sai, forced Guren to try to kill Seimei and after that kill himself by means of the Baku-kon spell, which takes control of the subject's heart. Because of that incident, most of the other Shinsh≈ç do not trust Guren, though K≈çchin states that their opinion of him is improving with Masahiro's help. Later in the series, Guren is corrupted by Chishiki no G≈´ji, losing his soul and becoming a cold-blooded monster who almost leaves Masahiro to die. It is later revealed that he's a slave of the Underworld, as he controls the Fires of Hell. His blood was required to break the final seal of the gate to the Underworld. At the end of the anime, Masahiro revives Guren; saving his life in exchange for Guren's memories of Masahiro being sealed away, so he would not have to remember and regret the terrible things he has done. Despite Guren having no memory of who he is, Masahiro felt that it was better than seeing him die. However, Guren is still one of Seimei's familiars. As such, he is under orders from Seimei to continue to look after Masahiro. K≈çchin K≈çchin appears as a mature-looking woman, about 25 years old with shoulder-length black hair. She is ranked second strongest of the twelve in attack power, after Guren. She specializes in close range fighting with twin sai. Unlike the others, K≈çchin does not resent Guren much, if at all, and is actually close to him, as seen when he refers to K≈çchin as 'K≈ç'. When Masahiro asks him about this, he refuses to respond. She also watched over Masahiro when he was a baby together with Guren. She is very observant and has a clear grasp of all of the Shinsh≈ç's personalities. She is also very good at noticing small details. Her second name from Seimei is Keito, Rikug≈ç Rikug≈ç's primary role is to be Seimei's on-call bodyguard, but he will leave Seimei's side to aide Masahiro should he be ordered to do so. His sense of loyalty is so strong that he was willing to put aside his doubts regarding Masahiro's abilities and accepted him as Seimei's successor on little more than his master's assurances. He differs from the other Shinsh≈ç in that he rarely uses magical attacks, preferring instead to fight opponents with a barbed spear. He can also use his cape as a shield and create an explosive 360-degree shock wave of air by striking the ground with his weapon. He also has a chain that he used against the corrupted Guren but it proved ineffective. Rikug≈ç is a man of few words and only speaks when he must. The only way to notice any change in his emotions was through his eyes. This began to change, however, after he met Kazane, whom he fell in love with. He saved Kazane's life twice. The first, when she was swallowed by a demon and then another time when they were in the underworld. He began to show emotions soon after that. He was furious when she was killed. Just before she died, they shared an emotional embrace and he revealed to her that his name is Saiki, and that she is the only one he had told his name to. Seimei gave him the name Rikugo, and only Seimei and Kazane know \\"Saiki\\" as well. Seiry≈´ Seiry≈´ is stubborn, anti-social and has a bad temper. He harbors a deep contempt for Guren due to his attempted murder of Seimei and considers Masahiro to be unworthy to be Seimei's successor. Seiry≈´ even went as far as to say that if Guren ever harmed a human again, he would personally kill him. He attacks with blasts of lightning and fights with a large two handed scythe. His second name from Seimei is Sh≈çran . Seiry≈´ cares about Seimei's wellbeing more than any of the others. However, he always shows his care through anger. Suzaku Suzaku, like Guren, is a fire user. However, unlike Guren's destructive flames, Suzaku's flames are used to purify evil spirits. He uses a heavy-bladed Zanbato to slash his enemies. Suzaku has bright red hair and wears a white strip of cloth around his forehead, which was originally Ten‚Äôitsu's. He is very much in love with Ten‚Äôitsu and is fiercely protective of her due to her wound transfer ability, going as far as to hit Masahiro after Ten‚Äôitsu saved him. The reason he cares about her is that Ten‚Äôitsu's past self was Suzaku's best friend who was reborn right before his eyes after she died. Not wanting to lose her again, he decided to become her protector. His sword was later lent to Masahiro so he could infuse it with the power to kill gods. Ten'itsu Ten‚Äôitsu has the appearance of a young woman with long blond hair. Her earring originally belonged to Suzaku. Unlike the other members of the Shinsh≈ç, she specializes more in magic than combat, particularly healing and clairvoyance. However, she is still able to create defensive shields with her magic. When someone has a very serious wound, she heals it by transferring the wound to herself, something that distresses her lover and fellow Shinsh≈ç, Suzaku. Ten‚Äôitsu's other name is Tenki, and only Suzaku uses it. She is usually seen protecting Akiko or just keeping her company. She is the only Shinsh≈ç of the twelve that has died before. Her past self wore her hair short and was loud and energetic. Tai‚Äôin Tai‚Äôin is a wind user who resembles a young girl with high pigtails. She also has a childish personality despite having lived for a long time. Several Shinsh≈ç consider her to be rash. Tai‚Äôin attacks with mini tornadoes and can also use the wind to communicate and pass messages. She can also 'read' the wind to know what is happening at other places but she is not good at it. Because of her personality, she is often on the receiving end of Byakko's lectures, with the current record being 8 hours. Tai‚Äôin does not like slimy things and often appears with Genbu. She can create a tornado to transport people to other places but the ride is usually very rough. A recurring gag in the series is that whenever she uses this, Masahiro and Genbu falls on the ground, with only the other Shinsh≈ç remaining standing. Genbu Genbu resembles a young 13-year-old boy. Although not possessing much ability in combat, Genbu specializes in defence and making barriers. However, out of the four people that can make barriers, his ability is the weakest. He is a water user and has a water mirror that allows the user to see things happening far away. He can also use the mirror to communicate with fellow water user, Tenk≈ç. Genbu is often seen with Tai‚Äôin, whom he berates for the things she does. Tenk≈ç (anime only) Tenk≈ç, like Genbu, is a water user. She appears to be about the same age as Kazane and has long, light silver hair. Tenk≈ç is the weakest out of the eight fighting Shinsh≈ç. She gets along well with K≈çchin. She is as stubborn as Seiry≈´ but has her gentle side. She first appears in the 20th episode & finally had her first speaking role in the final episode of the series. Taij≈ç Taij≈ç is a man with green hair. He appears as a very calm and respectful man, who always call Seimei's family with the suffix \\"sama\\". He first appeared in the 20th episode & finally had his first speaking role in the final episode of the series. Byakko Byakko resembles a strong middle-aged man with grayish-green hair. Like Tai‚Äôin, he is a wind user but his wind is more 'gentle' and travels more slowly than Tai‚Äôin's. He treats Tai‚Äôin and Genbu like his children. He is also the only one that can keep Tai‚Äôin under control. Tenk≈´ Tenk≈´ resembles an old man with a long beard. He is the governor of the twelve Shinsh≈ç and rarely leaves the spirit world. He has the strongest ability of making barriers and defence among all the Shinsh≈ç. This was seen with the fact that he can immobilize enemies without leaving the spirit world. He also makes all of the Shinsh≈ç's weapons. He first appears in the 20th episode & finally had his first speaking role in the final episode of the series where he talks to Takao no Kami about Masahiro's willingness to save Guren at the cost of his life. Other important characters Takaokami no Kami She is the dragon goddess of Kifune Mountain. She is a very powerful god that the twelve Shinsh≈ç including Seimei respect. When Ky≈´ki and his demons came to Japan, he manipulated Akiko's cousin Keiko to seal her so that he and his demons could hide at Kifune Mountain without interference. Masahiro who used his magic to break the seal later freed her. As a sign of gratitude, she saves Masahiro's life after a possessed Akiko stabs him. Later in the series, she helps Masahiro and his companions when the capital is in trouble. She also took over Masahiro's body to discuss important issues with Guren regarding Masahiro but later decides to tell the latter herself in her human form. She usually appears as a white dragon but later appears as a purple haired woman in her 30s usually telling anyone to call her Takao when she is in her human form. Even so, her official name is . She later gave Masahiro , flames that has the power to kill gods in order to kill Guren who has been corrupted. Kurumanosuke (drama CD only) A y≈çkai who resembles a carriage with a wide-mouthed ogre's face mounted on the left wheel. Masahiro first encountered Kurumanosuke while patrolling the streets of the capital and almost exorcised him for allegedly attacking a human, but spared him after realizing Kurumanosuke was only trying to help a drunk who had passed out in the street. Later, Kurumanosuke accepted Masahiro as his master and serve him by taking him to places he wants to go. When the capital was invaded by demons from the Underworld, it was Kurumanosuke who helped hide the Zakki in his carriage to save their lives. The Zakki The term 'zakki' is used to refer to the demons of lower rank. Since Masahiro exorcised Ban Ban, a demon that was attacking the Zakki, they now act as informants for Masahiro, telling him of any strange happenings or sightings. In the anime, the Zakki are usually represented by three demons; a lizard with three eyes, a yellow skinned gremlin and a pink, round ball. The Zakki usually appear by suddenly dropping out of the sky and landing on his head and calling him \\"Seimei's grandson\\" much to his dismay, a running gag in the light novels and anime. Ky≈´ki Arc Ky≈´ki The leader of the foreign demons, Ky≈´ki's form is that of a gigantic winged tiger with horns and saber fangs but can also assume the shape of a massive demon bull. After losing his territory in China to a rival demon, Ky≈´ki and his army of demons seek to establish a new territory in Japan, specifically around the imperial capital. Although possessing incredible strength and power, Ky≈´ki is hampered by a massive wound on his throat inflicted by the demon which chased him from China and which requires the consumption of someone possessing great spiritual power in order to heal. As Seimei is too strong for him to attack, Ky≈´ki targets Masahiro instead but also pursues Akiko as well for her Kenki ability and because beautiful longhaired girls are his favorite food. He usually has his followers attack his enemies and uses his enemies‚Äô desires to control them. He is eventually killed when Masahiro uses the G≈çma no Tsurugi to stab him though the chest in order to transmit a spell directly into Ky≈´ki's body. Fujiwara no Keiko Fujiwara no Keiko is Akiko's cousin and a member of the Fujiwara clan. She was once engaged to a man who then wed another woman instead. What angered her was the fact that the woman he married was from a higher noble family and had begged him to marry her. Ky≈´ki used her heartbreak to possess her with the promise that if she helped him, he would curse her beloved's wife and force him to leave her and return to Keiko. Although the possession sickened her body and confined her to bed, Keiko's cursed spirit was able to leave the house and help Ky≈´ki by sealing the dragon goddess of Kifune Mountain so his army could hide on the mountain. While under Ky≈´ki's influence she was willing to do anything to be with the man she loved, even kill anyone who got in her way and sacrificing her cousin Akiko. Seimei was able to exorcise her and she woke up in her home not remembering anything that had happened. Ban Ban Looking like a giant-bodied rat with the head of a turtle, he was one of Ky≈´ki's followers. He was also the demon that made Masahiro realize that the demons he was fighting were from China. He first appears in Masahiro dreams and later attack the Zakki in their hideout where he dies bleeding from his injuries from fighting Guren and Masahiro. Gaku Gaku is one of Ky≈´ki's advisors and lieutenants to his followers. It always looks down upon their opponents believing all of them are weak. The other adviser is Shun It was one of the demons whom were responsible for putting a cursed wound on Akiko's hand. Due to his overconfidence, Masahiro and the Shinsh≈ç finally killed them. Kazane Arc Kazane She is initially introduced as a daughter of Ry≈´sai. She is a formidable fighter, able to use magic and weapons as well. She is able to stand her ground and even defeat Seiryu and Genbu in a 2-on-1 battle. She has a deep hatred for Guren because she believes that he killed her father. She has a crow for a companion named Kai and cares very deeply for it. She and Rikug≈ç seem to have feelings for each other. Rikug≈ç has the most confrontations with her and ended up falling in love with her. He tried to talk some sense in her that Chishikii no G≈´ji is just using her to open the Underworld but she replied that it is of her own free will. It is later revealed that she is not really Ry≈´sai's daughter but in fact the daughter of Chigaeshi no Miko. Chishiki no G≈´ji kidnapped her when she was young and had her memories sealed. She was trained by Ry≈´sai and was told a lie that Seimei and Guren were responsible for her parents‚Äô death. Unknown to her, she was secretly used to open the first gate of the Underworld due to the fact only those related to the Priestess can open the gate. When she found out the truth and was weakened by Chishiki no G≈´ji to open the gate, she tried to escape from the underworld demons where her pet crow, Kai sacrificed his life by teleporting her away. Sadly, it was all in vain as she was killed by a demon who stabbed her through the chest. Despite being a villain, she was still a good person since did care about Princess Nagako and tried to send her back to her family as she regretted kidnapping and using her in the first place. Her last moments before dying were with Rikug≈ç, who held her in his arms, where she learned his real name. Her necklace was used to defeat Chishiki no G≈´ji and was later given to Rikug≈ç by her mother, who later brought her daughter's body back to their home. Nagako Naishin≈ç She is the Emperor's daughter. When her brother was born, her parents, joyful that they finally had a son, ignored her. Feeling lonely and bitter, she was befriended by Kazane, who was disguised as a nanny. Kazane used her anger to curse the capital. Despite being used by Kazane, Nagako still loves her because Kazane is the only friend she has ever had. When she was sent to the underworld, she felt that nobody, not even her mother, cared about her anymore. However, when Masahiro and Genbu show Nagako that her mother still cares for her and regrets not spending time with her, she realizes that her parents still love her. She is later reunited with her family. Chigaeshi no Miko She is mother of Kazane. She resides in the Overturned Earth, a realm between the human world and the underworld where the guardians of the underworld protects her and her family, large animals whose duty is to serve the Priestess and protect the seal of the Underworld. Fifty years before the Kazane arc began; she sought the help of onmy≈çji Seimei and Ry≈´sai to help her seal the gates of the underworld since the seal was getting weaker. However, Ry≈´sai fell deeply in love and kidnapped her instead. She later left Ry≈´sai to go back to the realm but was kidnapped by Chishiki no G≈´ji. He sealed her into a frozen rock since he could not get her to open the Underworld gate; instead, he used her daughter, Kazane. She was later found and rescued by Seimei. However, she was later in grief when she found out her daughter, Kazane died. She later brought back her daughter's body back to her home and gave Rikug≈ç her necklace as a sign of gratitude for protecting her daughter. Ry≈´sai Enoki He is Seimei's only best friend and a powerful onmy≈çji. While Ry≈´sai was not as powerful as Seimei, he had learnt the Baku-kon spell. The Baku-kon spell could forcefully control anyone's heart, which is a spell that Seimei dislikes. Fifty-five years ago, he accompanied Seimei to Izumo to check a disturbance there despite objection by Seimei not to follow him. There, he and Seimei met Chigaeshi no Miko who he fell deeply in love with. He was soon manipulated by Chishiki no G≈´ji to kidnap the Priestess and break the seal of the Underworld and made to believe that by doing so, he could get the Priestess all for himself. When Guren and Seimei tried to stop him, he uses the Baku-kon spell on Guren and made him try to kill Seimei. Guren finally killed him, but his body was used by Chishiki no G≈´ji's soul. He uses his body to help him in his plan with the promise that he could still get the Priestess all for himself. His body was finally destroyed by Rikug≈ç & Seimei and his spirit thanks Seimei for freeing him. Chishiki no Soushu He is the real villain that has been controlling Kazane and Ry≈´sai. Seimei and his Shinsh≈ç fought him once before many years ago, but now he has returned to open the Gates of the Underworld. He is also called by the name of or Rikug≈ç was the first one to realize he was back because he heard Kazane talking to him through a second head protruding from her crow, Kai. When he was mortally injured, he transferred his soul into Ry≈´sai's body to continue his plans. He trained Kazane and lied about what happen to her parents so she would help him open the gates of the underworld. He later also controls Guren since his blood was needed to break the final seal. He was finally killed, by Kazane's necklace.

Their functions were moved to a new civic building away from the center. In 2012, the building underwent a $2.5 million renovation using Community Preservation Funds. The project concluded in December, 2013 and was reopened to the public in January 2014. It is primarily used for civic events and Special Hearings.

Description and history The Harrington House stands in a rural-residential area of southwestern Weston, on the northwest side of Wellesley Street north of its junction with Sylvan Lane. The original main block is 2-1/2 stories in height and four bays wide, with a side gable roof and clapboard siding. To this, a two-bay section was added to the east. The two sections are clearly different structures, with differing framing details, and floorboards in their garret spaces oriented differently. Ells further expand the house to the side and rear. The interior is largely reflective of an early 19th-century remodeling effort, in which the original central chimney was replaced by two interior chimneys, and a central stair was added. The land on which the house stands was part of a grant of more than to Robert Harrington in 1634. The oldest portion of the main block, apparently its eastern two thirds, was built about 1710 by Benjamin Harrington, Jr. The property remained in the hands of his descendants until 1906. The house is unusual as a well-preserved example of two houses that were joined together, estimated to have been done c. 1800, around the same period as the interior restyling.

The club hired architect William B. Stratton (husband of ceramicist and club member Mary Chase Perry Stratton) to design a suitable building; the structure was completed in 1924. P. 41. Description The exterior of the building is built of brick, in a featureless modern style. The six stories are differentiated into the lower three floors, which are blocky and regular; and the three upper floors, which appear to be set onto the lower floors. The brick color differs between the two sections, as does the appearance of the windows. There is also a horizontal range of bricks between the two sections. The lower floors were designed to be meeting spaces for social events and planning the activities of members. The three upper floors were used as an apartments for women who moved to Detroit for employment and wished to live in a wholesome environment. The interior decor was strongly influenced by the then-current Arts and Crafts movement, with hand-wrought ironwork and Pewabic Pottery tilework. The swimming pool was also decorated with Pewabic tile. Use The City Club offered a number of classes and recreation programs for women, eventually enrolling over 8,000 members. However, membership declined after World War II, and in 1974 the club moved to smaller quarters. The social space was used for various purposes, including a restaurant and bar in later years.

It is one of only two relatively unaltered 19th century commercial buildings in Melrose. The three story brick Second Empire building was built in 1880 by John Larrabee, on the site of a wood frame meeting hall. The block is built of brick laid in stretcher bond, and its third floor is under a mansard roof typical of the style. The ground floor consists of two storefronts with recessed entrances and plate glass windows, and a separate recessed entrance giving access to the upper residential floors. The second floor facade has two projecting bay windows, decorated with brackets and panel trim, above the two store fronts, and a sash window above the residential entrance. The mansard roof originally had single window dormers, but c. 1910, all but one of these (the one above the residential entrance) were removed and replaced by extensions of the second story bay windows. The north elevation is also decorated with some elaboration, even though it faces a narrow passage. Windows on the second floor are topped by segmented arches and brick corbelled hoods, and the mansard roof is pierced by six dormers similar in style to the original one on the front. Windows on the south elevation are more simply styled, having only segmented arch lintels, and the cornice becomes simpler towards the rear of the building. The back elevation is also simply decorated, and is mostly obscured by a c. 1930s vernacular three-tier porch. The interior of the building has also retained most of its original finishes. The ground floor shops have tin ceilings and walls, and original maple flooring, and the upper residential units retain much of the original woodwork, including fireplace mantels, wainscoting, and molded door and window surrounds. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Probably built in the early 18th century, it is one of the oldest buildings in the town. Its construction history shows changing residential trends over two hundred years of history. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Abraham Hill House is located northeast of downtown Belmont, on the southeast side of Pleasant Street (Massachusetts Route 60) between its junctions with Prospect Street and Scott Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is oriented with a gable end to the street, and its main facade on the side. The facade is three bays wide, with asymmetrical positioning including a slightly off-center entrance. Two brick chimneys rise from the interior through the rear roof face. There are 4 rooms to each floor in the main house. Each room has a fireplace. The kitchen had an extension from the chimney to ovens. On the left side of the house, the rear section extends beyond the side wall, a feature known regionally as a \\"Beverly jog\\". A single-story ell extends to the rear (northeast) side of the main block. The house is one of the oldest houses in Belmont, if not the very oldest. Its construction date is claimed by local historians to be 1693, but architectural analysis places its construction later, c. 1725‚Äì1750. It was enlarged significantly in the 1790s by Abraham Hill's son James, who was born in the house. Alterations included the conversion of the house from a central chimney plan to a central hall plan. It remained in the Hill family until 1942. The stockade fence was added in the 1960s. The ground floor windows are only 3-4' from the sidewalk.

The contents are the codification of all the laws currently in effect within Indiana. With roots going all the way back to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the laws of Indiana have been revised many times. The current approach to updating Indiana Code began in 1971 when the Indiana Statute Revision Commission began a complete rearrangement. The first official edition of the Indiana Code was published in 1976, and is regularly updated through the Office of Code Revision in the Legislative Services Agency. Organization An act of Congress, approved by the president on May 7, 1800, established the Indiana Territory as a separate governmental unit. The first General Assembly of the Indiana Territory met on July 29, 1805 and shortly after the Revised Statutes of 1807 was the official body of law. Indiana's constitution, adopted in 1816, specified that all laws in effect for the Territory would be considered laws of the state, until they expired or were repealed. Indiana laws were revised many times over the years, but the current approach to updating the code in a regular manner began in 1971. A special agency was established to reorganize the entire body of law for the State of Indiana, leading to the development of 36 distinct Titles that correspond to subject categories. The first official edition of the Indiana Code was published by West Publishing Company, under direction of the Indiana Legislative Council. Responsibility for publishing the Code was later assumed by the Legislative Services Agency, through the Office of Code Revision and working with the Code Revision Commission.

(Heart Says Hurray!) is a 2009 Indian Hindi-language sports film directed by Anurag Singhhttp://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/features/meet-anurag-singh-director- will-helm-akshay-kumar-salman-khan-karan-johar-project/ and produced by Aditya Chopra under the Yash Raj Films banner. It stars Rani Mukerji and Shahid Kapoor in pivotal roles in the story about a young woman who pretends to be a man to join an all-male cricket team. It also has Anupam Kher, Dalip Tahil, Rakhi Sawant and Sherlyn Chopra in supporting roles. The film was released on 18 September 2009, and received negative reviews upon The release. The film is a Bollywood adaptation of the 2006 United States hit film She's the Man. Plot Veera (Rani Mukerji) is a young woman who lives in a small village but dreams of playing cricket in the big league, being extremely talented in the game. Veera works in a nautanki and dances with the star performer, Shanno (Rakhi Sawant), an arrogant and conceited woman. Rohan (Shahid Kapoor) is an accomplished captain of a county cricket team in England. His father, Vicky, and mother, Yamini, are separated. Rohan lives with his mother in England and his father lives in India. Vicky has been captaining the Indian cricket team against the Pakistani cricket team in a tournament called the 'Aman Cup.' Every year, for 8 years, India has lost all matches. To win, Vicky pretends to have a heart attack and asks Rohan to come to India. When Rohan reaches India, he agrees to captain the team for his father, determined to make the team win. Rohan holds auditions to select the best players, but when Veera goes to audition, she is not allowed to enter because players have to be male. Upset, Veera then disguises herself as a man named Veer and is accepted into the team. One day when a glass of juice is thrown in Veera's face, her hair falls, but she hides it and runs to the men's changing room. Rohan looks for \\"Veer\\", but finds Veera in the changing room instead. Veera quickly pretends to be Veer's sister to cover the disguise. Rohan argues with her but later asks \\"Veer\\" to bring him to Veera to apologise. Rohan falls in love with Veera as herself (he does not recognise her as Veer). Rohan and Veera go on a date and Veera falls in love with Rohan as well. The big day of the match arrives, when India is set to play Pakistan in Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium. Rohan's mother arrives at the match and she and Rohan's father are reunited. In the match, Veer gets the other player out and everyone hugs her in joy. In the excitement, one of Veer's brown contact lenses falls out onto Rohan's finger and he realises that Veer is Veera. He argues with her about her deception and goes back to play the match without \\"Veer\\". Upset, Veer takes off her disguise, changing back to herself. When Rohan's team starts losing, Vicky tells Rohan that it isn't important to win or lose any more; he is happy that at least through the match, he and his mother came. But Rohan understands how badly his father wants to win this match, so he gets Veera to come back and play the match. Veera puts her disguise back on and plays well, but in the closing stages, she is tripped by a Pakistan fielder. Rohan rushes to her aid and the medical unit says that Veera's arm is fractured, but she determinedly continues playing. She shows her talent by switching sides and batting with her left hand. They win the match and Rohan asks \\"Veer\\" to show his true identity. Everyone is shocked that Veer is actually a woman and accuses her of being a cheat. Veera then gives a heart-touching speech about women and their talents that become useless because of men's dominance. Everybody realises that talented women should be allowed to play with men in cricket teams and gives her a round of significant applause. Veera sees Rohan's love for her and the two are reunited.

With a construction history dating to 1680, it was for nearly two centuries home to the Hoar family, a prominent legal and political family in Massachusetts. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The former Hoar Tavern is set close to Massachusetts Route 2 in eastern Lincoln, from which it is now separated by sound barriers and a low stone wall. The tavern property, about , includes the house/tavern and a barn of significant antiquity, the two now joined by an ell. The tavern is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, oriented facing south towards Route 2, which follows the route of the colonial-era Cambridge Turnpike. The main facade is five bays wide, with a projecting entry vestibule at the center. It has a central chimney, and is sheathed in wooden clapboards. The interior includes high-quality 18th-century wood paneling, as well as features indicative of its First Period construction. The barn is a large timber-framed structure, with beams thick. The house was probably built by Daniel Hoar in the 1680s, when the area was still part of Concord. Daniel's son John and grandson Samuel were both active in Lincoln town affairs, and served in the Battles of Lexington and Concord at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. Samuel's son (also named Samuel), was a leading attorney in Massachusetts in the first half of the 19th century, and his sons, Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar and George Frisbie Hoar, were both prominent in state and national politics. The property operated for over a century by the Hoars as a tavern, was sold out of the family in 1869.

Others contend that the iconic drink, now one of the Official Cocktails of the International Bartenders Association, was indeed invented in the King Cole Bar. Originally, the King Cole Bar was about fifty feet (15m) east of the small but ornate lobby of The St. Regis. It was a large room with many circular tables and a long north-south bar above which was the famous Parrish painting. Later, the bar was moved to a far smaller room east of that spot. The mural for which the venue is named, or perhaps a slightly smaller version of the painting, hangs behind the bar. It is by artist Maxfield Parrish and depicts \\"Old King Cole\\" who was a \\"merry old soul\\" calling for his pipe and bowl, and his \\"fiddlers three.\\" The bar has been the setting for scenes in The Devil Wears Prada, Hannah and Her Sisters, The First Wives Club, and Gossip Girl.

It was built about 1749 by Ebenezer Hobbs, a prominent local citizen. His son Isaac was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and owner of an adjacent tannery that was an important local business. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and included in the Kendal Green Historic District on March 1, 2000. Description and history The Isaac Hobbs House stands in suburban northeastern Weston, just north of the junction of North Avenue (Massachusetts Route 117) with Church Street in the town's Kendal Green area. It is a 2-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is oriented facing west, and is screened from the road by a fence, although it is located close to the road. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance and a cross gable above the center three bays. A two-story ell extends to the left side, and a small single-story ell projects to the right. The oldest portion of this house was built about 1749, probably by Ebenezer Hobbs, whose family had acquired the land for it in 1729. Ebenezer's son Isaac was a town selectman, representative in the state legislature, and a member of the Massachusetts militia who saw action in the Battle of Bunker Hill. A later descendant who owned the house was J.F. Baldwin Marshall, paymaster general to the Massachusetts troops in the American Civil War. The family also operated a tannery adjacent to the house, which was a significant business in the town until its closure in 1860, and is now town conservation land.

Spencer Cone Jones was the son of Reverend Joseph H. Jones (1798‚Äì1871), a Baptist minister, and Elizabeth (Clagett) Jones, of Montgomery County. He attended Rockville Academy, Frederick County public schools and Frederick College. After entering the legal profession, Jones practiced with William J. Ross of Frederick, and was admitted to the Frederick County bar in 1860. Civil War Jones enlisted in Company D of the First Maryland Cavalry of the Confederate Army at the beginning of the American Civil War. In May 1862, he was thrown in jail for eight months. Jones was first arrested as a prisoner of war and was thrown in the Baltimore City Jail. He was subsequently transferred between Fort McHenry and Fort Delaware for interrogation. He was listed both as a political prisoner and as a prisoner of war. Jones was released from Fort McHenry on December 16, 1863. In February 1864, Jones was indicted in Frederick County Circuit Court for levying war and was disbarred by the Frederick County Court in 1865. The charges were dropped in March 1866. After the war, Jones taught school near Huntsville, Texas, and returned to Maryland after the adoption of the state constitution of 1867. Jones continued to be influential among many former Confederates, speaking at meetings of war veterans, including the dedication of a memorial to the Confederate dead in Winchester, Virginia. Professional life Jones returned to Maryland in 1868 established a law practice in Rockville, Maryland. On December 21, 1871, he married Ellen Brewer, daughter of John and Elizabeth Stewart (Buchanan) Brewer. On January 31, 1875, Ellen Jones gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, who later married Thomas R. Falvy of New Orleans, Louisiana. Mrs. Jones died on July 21, 1876 A Democrat, Jones was elected State's Attorney of Montgomery County in 1871 and re-elected in 1875. He also served as clerk of the Maryland Court of Appeals, from 1879 to 1891. During this period, Jones was often appointed to serve as a Trustee in equity cases that were heard before the Montgomery County Circuit Court. He also rose to a high position within the Maryland Democratic Party, speaking frequently at state party conventions, as well as Democratic parties and rallies. The Maryland legislature elected him Treasurer of the State of Maryland in 1892. He was re-elected in 1894, but lost the 1896 election due to a Republican majority in the Maryland General Assembly. Jones was considered several times for the Democratic Party nomination for Governor of Maryland. In 1895, Jones' nomination was thought likely, but his ambitions were thwarted when Arthur P. Gorman threw his support to a Mr. Hurst. He was subsequently elected Mayor of Rockville in 1898 and again in 1900. He resigned in 1901 upon being elected to the state Senate. During the session of 1902 he was chairman of the Finance Committee, and in 1904 he was elected president of the Maryland Senate. Maryland State House Jones took a leadership role in the construction of the State House Annex at the beginning of the twentieth century. As a state senator, Jones served on the Executive Committee of the State House Building Commission. On the Building Commission, he frequently participated in meetings regarding the funding and contracts for the State House refurbishment and construction of the State House Annex. In August 1902, the Baltimore Sun reported that the idea for the Annex was Jones' and that he submitted the appropriations bill to fund the restoration and construction. Jones' original bill requested $400,000, but at the request of the Governor and Treasury officials, he changed his request to $250,000, with the understanding that any additional money would be provided during the next legislative session. Jones was elected President of the State Senate on January 4, 1904, and gave a speech that emphasized the importance of completing construction on the State House: \\"So with the sunshine of prosperity, honor and usefulness upon us should we hesitate to make this house a beautiful, lasting and appropriate expression of our gratitude for, and pride in, the achievements of our people? It is with sadness that we are compelled by the necessities of the situation to vacate the old Senate Chamber, memorable in the history of the State, and in which cluster associations which strike a tender chord in the heart of every true Marylander. Let us have if restored as near as, possible to its original condition and sacredly preserve it as the holiest of all in this temple of our liberties,\\" (Archives of Maryland, Vol. 401, pp. 10). A major focus of Jones' speech was that the Legislature should provide the necessary funding to complete the work on the State House and that such work must maintain the original character of the building. End of career, personal associations, death Jones' term in the Senate ended with his defeat in a primary by Blair Lee in 1905. In addition to his legal practice and his political career, Jones was the director, and later president, of the Montgomery County National Bank of Rockville. Jones was a Mason and Knight of Pythias, with whom he held high offices. He also served as vice president of the Board of Visitors of the State School for the Deaf in Frederick, Maryland. Jones died April 1, 1915, in New Orleans, at the home of his daughter, Elizabeth, and son-in-law, Thomas R. Falvy. His body was brought back to Frederick and buried with his wife, Ellen.

It extends along Washington Street (Massachusetts Routes 16 and 126 for about one mile, between Winter Street and Highland Street. Incorporated in 1724, this area now includes a well-preserved collection of predominantly 19th century architecture. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The town of Holliston was first settled by European settlers in the 1680s, when it was part of Sherborn. The town was incorporated in 1724, named for Thomas Hollis, a wealthy English merchant. At that time, the town's first meetinghouse was built, and its first cemetery (the Central Cemetery, located next to the town offices and opposite Elm Street) was laid out. Washington Street itself was laid out in 1731, joining the town to Mendon. Typical finer houses of this early period would have resembled the Isaac Foster House, 627 Washington Street, built in 1727. The town's major period of growth during the 19th century took place before the American Civil War, resulting in the construction of a number of fine Federal and Greek Revival houses in its center. A number of its major civic buildings were also built during this time, including the Federal style First Congregation Church (1822) and Italianate style Town Hall (1855). Other churches were built during this time, but only the 1833 Methodist Church survives, extensively altered, as a Masonic hall. After the war, development remained slow until the arrival of the railroad c. 1900, when a number of brick commercial buildings went up. Also built during this time was the Holliston Public Library (c. 1903), which received funding support from Andrew Carnegie. Although there are some more modern 20th century intrusions consequent to the town's growth as a suburb, much of the center is recognizably from the turn of the 20th century or earlier.

Earlier thought that Hypnale walli and Hypnale nepa were two distinct species, but it is now accepted that it is the same species and Hypnale walli is a synonym name. Relatively small, they are distinguished by a strongly upturned snout. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description Adults grow to a total length of . According to Wall (1921), the maximum recorded lengths are for a male of and a female of . According to Deraniyagala (1955), the largest specimen in the Colombo museum was in total length with a tail measuring . In general, the tail is 13-18% of total body length. The body is moderately slender with a head that is conspicuously distinct from the neck. This species is distinguished from H. hypnale by a snout that has a strongly upturned tip. This is due to an extended rostral scale, which is immediately followed by a raised wart-like hump covered with 7-14 very small scales. Also, the hemipenes have clearly visible spines. The scalation includes 17 rows of dorsal scales at midbody that are weakly keeled or smooth, 124-142 ventral scales, and 33-41 subcaudal scales. The color pattern consists of a light brown to dark brown to pale olive ground color, flecked and mottled with darker tones. This is overlaid with a series of 17-26 dorsolateral suboval or subtriangular brown blotches that alternate or oppose each other middorsally. These blotches are 3-4 scales wide and extend down to the third scale row. The top of the head is brown and usually lacks any pattern except for a black postorbital stripe that extends to the neck.

It extends for about three-quarters of a mile, and includes elements representative of the development of Weston from a rural agricultural community to a residential suburb of Boston. In addition to a variety of predominantly residential and agricultural properties, it includes two formerly industrial sites important in Weston's history: the site of the Hobbs Tannery, and that of the Hook and Hastings Organ Factory. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history North Avenue is a through street in northeastern Weston that dates to colonial days, now connecting Waltham to Maynard. It is roughly paralleled to the south by the Fitchburg Railroad, now primarily used as a commuter rail line by the MBTA, with a stop labelled Kendal Green just south of North Avenue on Church Street. The historic district extends along North Avenue between Hobbs Brook Road in the east to Viles Street in the west, where the Hastings commuter rail station is located. Most of the district's properties line North Avenue, with an extension on Church Street to including the historic station building there, and along Viles Street and Brooks Road to include a small industrial area. The Weston area was first settled in the 17th century, when it was part of Watertown, and North Avenue was one of the locuses of early settlement. The oldest building in the district is the c. 1707 Whitney Tavern at 171 North Avenue. In 1729 Josiah Hobbs (for whose family Hobbs Brook is named) purchased much of the land in this area, and also acquired a water right at which he operated a tannery, one of the first such industries in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Five generations of Hobbses operated the tannery for more than an century, and built a number of surviving houses in the district, including 87, 88, and 121 North Avenue. #87, the Isaac Hobbs House, is separately listed on the National Register. The railroad, which effectively bounds the district to the south, was built through the area in the 1840s, but did not immediately affect development. In the 1880s the E. and G.G. Hook and Hastings Organ Company built a factory on Viles Street at the railroad, which became the town's largest employer and a significant economic force in its development. Although none of the company's industrial buildings have survived, a significant number of houses on North, Viles and Brooks were built either by the company or by others to house its workers.

It is believed to be the first store in Acton and holds the distinction of being the town of Acton's longest established business. In 1845, the tavern was merged into James Tuttle's store. Tuttle consolidated his businesses in the new Exchange Hall building in 1860. In 1878 Elnathan Jones established a dairy farm on the property, and the building was divided into apartments for farm workers, a role it served until about 1900. The building was rescued from imminent demolition in 1964 by local residents, who formed Iron Work Farm in Acton, Inc., a Massachusetts non-profit corporation with a charter \\"to acquire and preserve the tangible landmarks of the area historically known as Iron Work Farm\\".

Now the heart of the village of South Natick, it now exhibits a diversity of architecture from the 18th to early 20th centuries, laid out along historic 17th-century colonial routes. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The South Natick village center is located in southeastern Natick, formed by the junction of Eliot Street (Massachusetts Route 16) with Union and Pleasant Streets. It is located just north of a bend in the Charles River, and has a documented history of both colonial and prehistoric settlement. The roadways probably predate 1651, likely serving as Native American trails. In that year, missionary John Eliot established a settlement of Praying Indians, the first of its kind, on this site. The present bridge across the Charles is located where an early footbridge was built, and the South Natick Dam is at the site of what was once a natural falls and fishing weir. The Native settlement, originally with about 180 individuals, had shrunk by 1797 to just 20. The town, incorporated in 1781, was then dominated by white settlers, its center relocated to a more geographically central site. The first dam in the village was built in 1752, and the area now occupied by a town park on the banks of the river was an industrial site, with a fulling mill and sawmill. The historic district is essentially X-shaped, radiating away from the central junction on the four roadways. Its center is dominated by the Federal-style John Eliot Church (1828), and the Gothic former John Eliot Congregational Church (1862), and the Renaissance Bacon Library, built in 1880 to a design by Robert G. Shaw. The library is built partly over the grounds of the colonial- era Indian burying ground, one of the places of particular archaeological significance in the district. The village also includes the homes of two important 19th-century writers: one of Harriet Beecher Stowe, and another (a National Historic Landmark) of Horatio Alger.

Built about 1725, it was one of the oldest surviving colonial era houses in the town, prior to its deconstruction in 2000. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The Abraham Jaquith House was prominently located at the northeast corner of Concord Road and Middlesex Turnpike. It was a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade was five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a 19th-century Italianate hood. The rear roof extended to the first floor in leanto fashion, giving the house a saltbox profile. Windows were rectangular sash, with a slightly smaller one above the entrance. The interior included exposed beams, a narrow winding staircase in the entry vestibule, and feathered woodwork around the fireplaces. The chamber in the leanto section showed evidence that it was a later construction. Local tradition historically credited this house's construction to George Farley, one of the area's first colonial settlers (arrived 1654), but architectural analysis of the western three bays, its oldest portion, place their construction closer to 1726-27, around the time when Farley's daughter married Abraham Jaquith. The leanto and original eastern two bays were added during the 18th century. Family lore says that the eastern half of the house was allowed to deteriorate in the late 19th century by one of two brothers occupying the house. That portion eventually collapsed, and was poorly reconstructed in 1922. In 2000, building owner Peter Jaquith Casey had the house disassembled and stored in New Hampshire in order to preserve it. Parts of the structure were dismantled and re-assembled on 12 acres in Gilmanton, New Hampshire by Gilmanton resident Douglas Towle in 2010, who then sold it as a private dwelling alongside reconstructed outbuildings, including a barn typical of the 1700‚Äì1800s and an old schoolhouse and corn crib.Restoration Process for Farley Garrison House, at 1246 Province Rd, Gilmanton, NH 03237, featuring Douglas Towle, http://www.nhhomemagazine.com/May- June-2012/Relocating-history/ It is unknown whether the reconstruction included a new reproduction of the eastern half of the house.

Biography Sauter studied design at the UdK Berlin, and studied direction and camera at the German Academy for Film and Television, Berlin. He has been using computers both as a tool and as a medium since the early stages of his work. A pioneer of new media, he has developed and shaped this field with his works from the early 1980s on. In 1988 he founded the new media design studio ART+COM, together with other designers, architects, technologists, and their ilk - more generally, artists and scientists. Their goal was to practically research this new upcoming medium in the realm of art and design. They have come to emphasize the translation of information (easily transmissible via new media) into physical spaces, offering a more communal, reality-grounded experience than computer monitors alone allow for. As Head of Design at ART+COM, he leads the interdisciplinary group‚Äôs innovative experiments, using new technologies to convey complex topics while exploring their potential for spatial communication and art.

Life  B√∂cken was born in Munich, in Bavaria. He entered the Order of St. Benedict at an early age, made his religious profession at the Abbey of St. Peter, Salzburg, in 1706, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1713. Having been made a Doctor of Canon and Civil Law (1715), he was sent to Rome and on his return was chosen, in 1721, to succeed Benedict Schmier, as professor of canon law at the Benedictine University of Salzburg, where he remained for a period of twenty years. He was also attached to the theological faculties of Salzburg and Fulda, was secretary of the university, and an ecclesiastical councillor of four successive archbishops in the See of Salzburg and of the Prince-Abbot of Fulda. Eventually he appears to have incurred the displeasure of Archbishop Leopold of Salzburg, and in consequence of repeated friction resigned his position in 1741. He was then made pastor of Dornbach, a suburb of Vienna, and, two years later, superior of Maria-Plain near Salzburg, where he spent the last nine years of his life as confessor to the many pilgrims.  Works  The \\"Commentarius in Jus Canonicum universum\\" which B√∂cken published at Salzburg (1735‚Äì39), and dedicated to his friend and patron the Prince-Abbot of Fulda, is his major work. He had previously (1722‚Äì28) issued a number of separate treatises on the five books of the Decretals; these were updated in his larger work, to the third volume of which, in an appendix, he also added a lengthy disquisition \\"De praescriptionibus\\". A reprint of the \\"Commentarius\\" appeared at Paris in 1776.  Theology  B√∂cken held rather extreme views on the subject of the veneration due the saints. He maintained that the special veneration and invocation of the saints, particularly of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is absolutely necessary for salvation. A sermon which he preached on this subject in 1740 precipitated an acrid discussion at the university between the members of the \\"Old School\\" and the \\"New School\\" of theology, between the Sycophantae and the Illuminati as they were called. The sermon appeared also in print, with annotations wherein B√∂cken characterized as erroneous the contrary opinion of Muratori.

Built in 1895 toa design by Perkins & Betton, this Colonial Revival style housed the local public library for many years. It presently houses the Littleton Historical Society. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 18, 1991. Description and history The Houghton Memorial Building occupies a triangular parcel of land at the junction of King and Foster Streets, southwest of Littleton's modern center. King Street (Massachusetts Route 2A) passes north of the building and Rogers Street is a short spur joining it to Foster Street. This area was historically the town center, and the building occupies a highly prominent position. It is a 1-1/2 story building, constructed out of yellow brick and a light-colored terra cotta. Its main entrance is in a pavilion 2-1/2 stories in height that projects from the northern end of the west side. It has a fully pedimented gable with modillions and dentil molding. The entrance is set in a round-arch opening, flanked by windows set in lower round-arch openings, with a three-part Palladian window on the second level. Courses of terra cotta extend around the building, separating the basement level from the first floor, and the first from the second. Windows on the first floor are typically round-arch sash. The building's interior has retained a significant degree of original material. The building was designed by Perkins & Betton and built in 1894-95 to house the municipal library. It was a gift from Elizabeth and Clement S. Houghton, he the son of one of Boston's wealthiest merchants, William S. Houghton. The elder Houghton, a Littleton native, had in 1884 made a bequest to the town for the establishment of a library collection in honor of Reuben Hoar, who had financially assisted his father in a difficult time. The Shingle style building erected by that bequest stood at the site of the present town hall, and also housed town offices. It was a major local landmark until its destruction by fire in 1943. The library, still named in honor of Reuben Hoar, is now located at 41 Shattuck Street, while the Houghton Memorial Building now houses the Littleton Historical Society.

The modern company was formed in 1997 by the consolidation of two armoured security concerns, Wells Fargo Armored Service and Loomis Armored Inc. Their international network covers over 400 operating locations in the US and eleven western European countries. In the US, Loomis operates an electronically linked service network of nearly 200 operating locations, employs over 8,000 people and utilizes a fleet of approximately 3,000 armored and other vehicles to provide secure armored transport, automated teller machine (ATM) services, cash processing and outsourced vault services for banks, other financial institutions, commercial and retail businesses. It was a division of Securitas AB from 2001 to 2008, when it was listed at Nasdaq OMX Stockholm. History Wells Fargo Armored Service When the express mail firm of Wells Fargo & Company ceased to express service in 1918 upon the organization of American Railway Express, the company continued to exist, though no longer an operating company in the United States. George C. Taylor of American Express was president of American Railway Express with Burns D. Caldwell of Wells Fargo as chairman of the board of directors. Davis G. Meller, previously the firm's foreign traffic manager, assumed the presidency of Wells Fargo in 1918.Noel M. Loomis, Wells Fargo, pp. 317-318. New York: Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., 1968. Elmer Ray Jones, who had been with Wells Fargo since 1893, purchased Wells Fargo & Company's Express in Mexico and Wells Fargo in Cuba in 1919 for $640,000. He headed a group of men from Wells Fargo and American Express in 1924 to buy Wells Fargo & Company in the United States from the E.H. Harriman estate, making arrangements with the executors, Charles A. Peabody and Robert W. DeForest. The shares were taken by American Express (51 per cent) and the group of individuals headed by Jones (29 per cent); the remaining 20 per cent remained outstanding. In 1924 Jones was elected president of Wells Fargo, which sold its 20,000 shares in the Wells Fargo Nevada National Bank, severing the final tie between the two institutions. Loomis, pp. 317-318. Jones redeveloped Wells Fargo as a concern for armored transportation and other specialized express movements. In 1947, for instance, he personally supervised the transfer of 13 tons of gold from Montreal to Mexico City by airplane. The company had a fleet of 50 armored cars in New York City, ten stores handling farm equipment, automobiles and trucks, and (together with American Express) the largest travel agency in Mexico. It also provided fast railroad freight service through a subsidiary, the Wells Fargo Carloading Corporation. Loomis, pp. 318-319. Succeeding Jones as president of Wells Fargo was Ralph T. Reed in 1956, Howard L. Clark in 1960, R.D. Beals in 1963, and James A. Henderson in 1964. Wells Fargo continued its overseas express service until the 1960s; by the middle of the decade, its subsidiaries operated armored cars in 12 Eastern and Southern states, and the concern had entered the coin-auditing and coin- rolling business.Loomis, p. 318. As an operator of armored cars, the company did business as the Wells Fargo Armored Security Corporation as an affiliate of Baker Industries, and later, after its acquisition by Borg-Warner Security, as Wells Fargo Armored Service. Loomis Armored Inc. Lee B. Loomis established Loomis Armored Car Service in 1925 in Portland, Oregon. The company's headquarters was moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1932. Loomis died in 1949, but Loomis Corporation remained under his family's ownership until 1979 when it was acquired by Mayne Nickless. Wingate Partners purchased Loomis in 1991, and the company was consolidated with Wells Fargo Armored Service in 1997 to form Loomis Fargo & Company. Mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures On July 15, 1996, Borg-Warner Security agreed to consolidate its Wells Fargo Armored Service with Loomis Armored Inc. Employing 8,500 and providing armored transportation, cash services and automated teller machine maintenance, the new concern was named Loomis Fargo & Company.\\"Wells Fargo and Loomis forming armored car company\\", The New York Times, July 16, 1996. The transaction was completed in 1997. In May 2001, Swedish securities services group Securitas AB agreed to buy the remaining 51 percent of Loomis Fargo & Co. for $102 million. On November 16, 2006, Securitas AB Chief Executive Officer Hakon Ericson announced the company's intention to split into several independent, specialized security companies, with its cash handling service division adopting the name \\"Loomis\\" throughout its international network. By the end of June 2007, the transition to the new identity had been completed, with Loomis employing 20,000 people in a network of 420 operating locations in 11 European nations and the United States. On 26 November 2007, Loomis announced the sale of Loomis Cash Management Ltd, its cash handling operation in the United Kingdom, to Vaultex UK Ltd jointly owned by HSBC Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc, resulting in a loss of approximately 160 million SEK. In 2008, Loomis was distributed to the Securitas shareholders and listed at Nasdaq OMX Stockholm as Loomis AB. On 4 April 2014, Loomis acquired Zurich based VIA MAT Holding AG, one of the world‚Äôs leading companies in international valuables logistics with an enterprise value of approximately CHF 200 million, thus adding International Services to the existing Cash in Transit and Cash Management Services lines of businesses and becoming market leader in cash handling in Switzerland. Major robberies During its first year of operation as the new Loomis Fargo & Company, the company was the target for two of the largest cash robberies ever committed on American soil. In March 1997, employee Philip N. Johnson, on his own, stole $18.8 million from the Loomis Fargo armored car that he was driving. In the October 1997 Loomis Fargo Bank Robbery, employee David Scott Ghantt and accomplices stole $17.3 million from the Loomis Fargo Charlotte, North Carolina branch vault that he was supervising. The perpetrators of both robberies, and a significant majority of the cash, were later caught by law enforcement. These two robberies, along with the unrelated $18.9 million Dunbar Armored robbery, which also occurred in 1997, were the first to surpass the previous holder of the title \\"largest cash robbery\\" in U.S. history, the $5 million cash portion (along with $0.9 million in jewellery) of the Lufthansa heist of December 1978. armoured vehicle in London, United Kingdom. The UK division of the company hit the headlines in February 2006 when armed robbers raided its cash center located in Tonbridge in Kent. The criminals made off with ¬£53m in what is known as the Securitas depot robbery. The next month, a Securitas van in Warrington, Cheshire was also robbed by criminals who rammed it with a stolen tractor and subsequently made off with over half a million pounds. Again the same month, an armed gang robbed a Securitas van as it was unloading money at Gothenburg's Landvetter Airport in Sweden. On October 4, 2007, two armored truck guards working for Loomis were killed in a robbery in Northeast Philadelphia. Another man was wounded. A bank surveillance photo showed the gunman walking up to the two guards, shooting both of them execution-style, and running off with a bag containing ATM deposit envelopes. The man later confessed to the killings. On November 30, 2016, a man stole a bucket containing gold flakes worth $1.6 million from the back of an open and unguarded Loomis truck on a busy street in Manhattan, New York.

The village is about halfway between Maniwaki and Hull at the intersection of Route 105 and Route 301, just west of the Gatineau River. The village and municipality are named after the Kazabazua River which passes through it. Like many other First Nations names, Kazabazua has had many spellings in English, such as Kazaluzu, Kasubasua, Cazabasua, Cazibazouis, Cazebalzuac, Cajibajouis. This word comes from the Algonquin word kachibadjiwan, from kach (\\"hidden\\") and djiwan (\\"current\\"), hence it means \\"underground river\\". This name is a reflection of the local topography because the Kazabazua River disappears underground and resurfaces a few dozen metres (yards) downstream. The river then flows through rapids and passes under a natural stone bridge. The communities of Kazabazua Station, Aylwin, and Aylwin Station are also located within the municipality. Geology The Kazabazua River disappearing underground. The bedrock of the region Kazabazua is composed predominantly of marble dating from the Precambrian Era and represent metamorphic sedimentary rocks from the Grenville orogeny.Centre d'Interpr√©tation en G√©ologie du Grenville, Plan de d√©veloppement int√©gr√©, Sites et circuits du patrimoine naturel de la r√©gion de l‚ÄôOutaouais, Montebello (Quebec), 2008-02-27 (Online version ) At the Kazabazua River, marble is calcitic and contains crystals of graphite and grossular garnet. The marble has been chemically and mechanically eroded by water from the river to form a karst stone bridge. The inclusion of gneiss in the marble illustrates erosion differential. The Kazabazua Plain is a geomorphological phenomenon unique to Quebec. It is made up of metamorphic rocks which are covered with a network of ancient sand dunes and bogs within which many rare plant species and threatened species have been identified. The topography is the result of water and wind action since the withdrawal of the last glacier. After this withdrawal, the region was covered by the Champlain Sea, which left a layer of marine clay. When the sea level lowered, the area was submerged under a postglacial delta which deposited large volumes of sand. History This area is part of the Algonquin First Nation territory and has long been inhabited by that people. Circa 1835, the area began to be settled and the community was originally called Hoganville, in memory of the first pioneers, the Hogan family, who were soon joined by the Gabie, Chamberlain, and Pritchard families. In 1858, the Aylwin Township was formed, followed in 1862 by the township municipality with the same name. These were named after judge and politician Thomas Cushing Aylwin (1806‚Äì1871). Also in 1862, the local post office opened, named Kazubazua. As evidenced by Lovell's Gazetteer of 1873, the village itself also began to be popularly known as Kazubazua. In 1932, the name was changed to Kazabazua and the municipality legally took this name in 1976. It is often shortened to \\"Kaz\\" by locals.

Built c. 1806 by John Davenport as a wing to a 1757 tavern built by Jonathan Cooper, this is one of the few Federal-period buildings to survive in the city. Moved to its present location in the 1880s, it now houses residences. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Cooper‚ÄìDavenport Tavern Wing is located at the north corner of Harris and Eustis Streets, in a densely- built residential area on the border between Somerville and Cambridge southeast of Porter Square. The building is a roughly rectangular two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboard siding. The front of the building faces northeast, and is four bays wide, with the entrance in the second bay from the right. It is flanked by pilasters and topped by an eyebrow transom window and a gabled pediment. A pair of brick chimneys pierce the left side of the roof. In 1757 Jonathan Cooper built a large house at the corner of what are now Beech Street and Massachusetts Avenue just north of what is now Porter Square. He was soon operating a tavern on the premises in what was then just beginning to develop as a commercial area. The Middlesex Turnpike opened on the route of Massachusetts Avenue in 1806, bringing additional business to the tavern. John Davenport, its owner at that time, constructed the present structure as a wing to the building Cooper built. By the 1880s the building was in decline, and the property was acquired for the construction of St. James Episcopal Church. The 1757 building was razed, and the wing was moved to its present location c. 1888. It is now used as a multi-unit residence.

Before he reached his teens, his father Vincenzo, was murdered in Marina di Gioiosa Ionica during a bloody feud that ravaged competing 'Ndrangheta clan Mazzaferro, in contrast to the clan Aquino. The clan survived and eventually rose to prominence under the leadership of Giuseppe Coluccio.

The 6th Airborne Division in Palestine was initially posted to the region as the Imperial Strategic Reserve. It was envisioned as a mobile peace keeping force, positioned to be able to respond quickly to any area of the British Empire. In fact the division became involved in an internal security role between 1945 and 1948. Palestine had been a British Mandate since the end of World War I. Under the terms of the mandate, Great Britain was responsible for the government and security of the country. It had long been a stated British aim to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and between 1922 and 1939 over 250,000 Jewish immigrants had arrived in the country. However, Arab resistance and World War II prompted the British to curtail immigration. The time also saw the rise of the Jewish Resistance Movement, which eventually came into conflict with the British authorities. When the British 6th Airborne Division arrived in response to increasing terrorist activity, it became involved in internal security, being responsible for cordons and search operations, guarding convoys and key installations. As the situation worsened, the men of the division had to patrol the towns and cities, enforce curfews and deal with rioting by the civilian population. They also protected Jewish and Arab settlements from sectarian violence. This was not without loss to the division and several members were killed and wounded during this time. The end of the British mandate coincided with the post war reduction of the British Army back to peace time levels, and the division's numbers were gradually reduced. By the end of their tenure in Palestine, the division's strength was reduced in real terms, to less than brigade size. In 1948 it was disbanded soon after its withdrawal from Palestine. Background In July 1922, the British Mandate of Palestine was created. Under the terms of the mandate, Great Britain was responsible for the government and defence of the country and for the establishment of a Jewish homeland. Then in September 1922, the League of Nations and Great Britain decided that any Jewish homeland would not be formed in the land to the east of the River Jordan. This instead became a separate country known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.Wilson, p.XIV Encouraged by the British, 265,000 Jewish immigrants, mainly from Europe, came to settle in Palestine between 1919 and 1939. Arab resistance and violence to this influx of immigrants came to a head in 1937, and the Peel Commission recommended that two states should be formed, one Arab and one Jewish, which would divide the country between them. Then in May 1939, the British restricted the number of Jewish immigrants to 75,000 in the White Paper of 1939. By the end of 1945, Jewish immigration had almost reached the 75,000 White Paper limit. Arab concerns led to the British putting further restrictions on immigration.Cole, p.202 Even when the scale of the Holocaust became known, the British stance remained the same. This led to an inevitable confrontation between the British authorities, illegal Jewish immigrants, and militant Zionist groups. It became a widespread belief within the Jewish community that the British were practising antisemitism and were no different from Nazi Germany.Cole, p.203 However, between 1945 and 1948 a further 85,000 Jewish immigrants, mostly survivors of the Holocaust, entered the country illegally. Jewish resistance movements Haganah unit circa 1942‚Äì1947 armed with an assortment of British weapons During this time the Jewish Resistance Movement was formed, comprising several pre-existing Jewish groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most Jewish males and some females were required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members.Wilson, pp.10‚Äì11 The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants into the country from Europe. It always attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.Charters, p.45 When Axis forces posed a threat to the Middle East in the Second World War, the Haganah organized a full-time, elite force, the Palmach. By 1947, this organization numbered around 2,200 members. Palmach members were subject to military discipline; many of them had served in the British forces during the war.Wilson, p.11 In 1937, a splinter group was formed by those not happy with the Haganah methods. This group was called the National Military Organization in the Land of Israel or Irgun in short. It launched a campaign of violence against the government in 1944, carrying out several terrorist attacks.Wilson, p.12 By 1945, Irgun had an estimated membership of 1,500.Charters, p.46 A third group was the Lehi, the Hebrew acronym of \\"Fighters for the Freedom of Israel\\", known in the British press as the Stern Gang. Lehi membership consisted of only around fifty men. It was the only Jewish group that contemplated working with the Italians and Germans during the war, and afterwards assassinated members of the British authorities.Wilson, pp.12‚Äì13 By 1946, both the Irgun and Lehi had declared war on Great Britain.Charters, p.74 British 6th Airborne Division Despite its name, the 6th Airborne Division was one of only two airborne divisions raised by the British Army during the Second World War.Ferguson, p.15 Before being deployed to Palestine, the division had served only in Europe. It had participated in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and later the Battle of the Bulge in December. After the Rhine crossing in March 1945, it spent six weeks advancing across Germany to the Baltic Sea.Ferguson, p.16 Parachute Regiment in Palestine. At the end of the war in Europe, it had been planned to send the division to Burma to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division.Cole, p.193 However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese surrender, ended the war and changed British plans. The 6th Airborne Division was nominated to be the Imperial Strategic Reserve. Together with a Royal Air Force troop-carrier formation, they were to be located in the Middle East as a quick reaction peace keeping force for the British Empire.Tugwell, p.294 Initially No. 283 Wing RAF had two squadrons of transport aircraft, 620 and 644, available to provide troop transport. By September 1945, the division was en route to the region for airborne training. However, conditions in Palestine were deteriorating. By the time the division arrived, instead of training, it was deployed on internal security. During the Second World War, the division comprised the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade, both consisting of parachute infantry, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade, composed of glider infantry. However the 5th Parachute Brigade had been sent to] India ahead of the rest of the division.Tugwell, p.285 So when the division was dispatched to the Middle East, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was assigned to bring them up to strength.Wilson, pp.212‚Äì213 In May 1946, after the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded, the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division, replacing the 6th Airlanding Brigade.Wilson, pp.214‚Äì215 In August 1946, the 5th Parachute Brigade returned from the Far East, and joined the division, but was disbanded soon afterwards. The next major manpower development came in 1947, when the 3rd Parachute Brigade was disbanded and the 2nd Parachute Brigade, while remaining part of the division, was withdrawn to England, then sent to Germany.Wilson, pp.216‚Äì217 Operations 1945 Still commanded by its last wartime commander, Major General Eric Bols, the division began deployment to Palestine in 1945.Wilson, p.5 The advance party arrived on 15 September, followed by the Tactical Headquarters on 24 September, then the 3rd Parachute Brigade on 3 October, the 6th Airlanding Brigade on 10 October and the 2nd Parachute Brigade on 22 October. After arriving by sea at Haifa, the newly arrived troops were sent to camps in the Gaza Subdistrict to acclimatize to the conditions, and to regain their fitness after the long sea journey from England.Wilson, pp.5‚Äì6 By the end of the month divisional headquarters was established at Bir Salim. The 2nd Parachute Brigade at remained at Gaza, the 3rd Parachute Brigade moved to the Tel Aviv and Jaffa region, while the 6th Airlanding Brigade moved to Samaria. Jerusalem on VE Day (8 May 1945) It was not long before the division became involved in operations, enforcing a night time curfew at the end of October after the railway in the divisional area was sabotaged. On 13 November the British Government confirmed they would examine the conditions of Jews in Europe and consult the Arabs to ensure Jewish immigration, at the time around 1,500 persons a month, was not hindered.Wilson, p,26 Unhappy that the announcement did not go far enough, the Jewish National Council arranged a twelve-hour strike for the next day. Rioting started in Tel Aviv and the Jewish part of Jerusalem, which resulted in the 3rd Parachute Brigade being deployed to patrol the streets for the following five days.Wilson, p.27 The first operation involving the 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over the night of 24/25 November. Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to the settlements of Rishpon and Sidna Ali. In the following cordon and search operation, the police were stoned by the inhabitants, and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages. The next day, 26 November, the police were involved in hand-to-hand fighting with the villagers and eventually withdrew, calling on the brigade to enter the settlements and enforce law and order. Leaving some men behind on the cordon to hold back the estimated 3,000 crowd, the remainder of the brigade entered the settlements. Here they carried out several baton charges and for the first time used tear gas to disperse the crowds. In the cleanup operation, 900 persons were later arrested.Wilson, pp.31‚Äì33 Near the end of the year, over the night of 26/27 December, several attacks were carried out by the Irgun on police stations, Palestine Railways installations and one British Army armoury. The 3rd Parachute Brigade again enforced a night time curfew on Tel Aviv. Then on 29 December, it took part in Operation Pintail, the search of Ramat Gan, for Irgun members involved in the attacks. The brigade questioned the 1,500 inhabitants, arresting eighty-nine.Wilson, p.35 1946 The first mission of 1946 was Operation Hebron on 8 January. This time the objective was the cordon and search of the town of Rishon LeZion by the 3rd Parachute Brigade and the police, during which fifty-five suspects were taken into custody. For the rest of the month, the brigade was involved in several smaller operations. In Operation Pigeon on 30 January, they searched the Shapira district of Tel Aviv. Parachute Regiment. On 5 March Major General James Cassels took over command of the division.Wilson, p.42 The next action involving the division was over the night of 2/3 April, when units of the Irgun attacked railway installations in the divisional area. While one attack on the Yibna railway station and police post was in progress, a mobile patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion arrived, detonating a mine while crossing a bridge. Three of the patrol were wounded, but the others took off after the saboteurs.Wilson, p.44 Reinforcements arrived from the 5th and 6th Parachute Battalions. In the morning, tracks of around thirty men were discovered leading away from the area. A spotter plane later located the men and directed a section of the 8th Parachute Battalion to intercept them. After a small battle, fourteen of the saboteurs were wounded and twenty-six prisoners taken.Wilson, pp.44‚Äì45 In March the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division. The 6th Airlanding Brigade left the division on 13 April, but remained in Palestine as the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade.Cole, p.204 This reduced the division's manpower by around twenty-five per cent as the strength of the airlanding brigade had been almost equal to that of two parachute brigades combined.Guard, p.37 At 20:45 on 25 April, the Lehi carried out an attack on a divisional car park in Tel Aviv. On that night, the car park was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion. The attackers, around thirty men, established a fire base in a house overlooking the car park. The attack began with a bomb thrown into a guard tent. Gunfire was directed at all of the soldiers in the area, then twenty of the attackers stormed the car park. Once inside the compound, they entered the guard tents, killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle racks of weapons. Another two off-duty soldiers, responding to the attack, were killed approaching the car park. In total, seven men from the division were killed.Wilson, p.46 This was the first deliberate attack by any group targeting the British Army, which had not established defences against any form of assault. During the following day seventy suspects were rounded up, but no evidence of their involvement could be found. In response to the attack, the British imposed a road curfew from 18:00 to 06:00 each night and all cafes, restaurants and public entertainment venues in Tel Aviv were closed between 20:00 and 05:00.Wilson, p.47 However this was not enough for some members of the division, who attacked Jewish houses in Qastina and Be'er Tuvia, injuring some of the occupants. Those involved were later punished by the British Army.Wilson, p.48 Attacks on the security services had increased to a level that on 19 June all ranks were ordered to be armed at all times on or off duty, and to travel in pairs during the day and in threes at night.Wilson, p.115 Near the end of June the division received orders for Operation Agatha, the arrest of Jewish leaders \\"suspected of condoning\\" or being involved in sabotage or murder of civil and military personnel. Agatha was a nationwide operation involving not only the 6th Airborne Division but the Palestinian Police Force and all other army units in the country. Secondary objectives were to gather intelligence and arrest any members of the Palmach that could be found.Wilson, p.57 Operation Agatha started at 04:15 on 29 June. The 2nd Parachute Brigade was responsible for Tel Aviv, the 1st Parachute Brigade for Jewish settlements around Ma'abarot and the 3rd Parachute Brigade for those around Givat Brenner.Wilson, pp.57‚Äì58 The operation ended on 1 July after 2,718 suspects had been arrested. Many had no connection to the resistance movements and were instead arrested for harassing the searchers or for refusing to give their names when asked.Wilson, p.60 The 6th Airborne Division alone arrested 636 persons, 135 of them for being suspected Palmach members and ten were Jewish leaders.Wilson, p.61 The King David Hotel after the attack The next major incident was on 22 July, when the British administrative and military headquarters located in the King David Hotel were bombed. No members of the division were directly involved, but the Royal Engineers of the 9th Airborne Squadron were called in to take charge of the search for survivors and secure the part of the building left standing. Over the next three days they located six survivors and the bodies of ninety- one victims.Wilson, pp.63‚Äì64 To assist in the search for those responsible, the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions moved into Jerusalem on 23 July.Wilson, p.65 The British response to the bombing came on 30 July, when the division carried out Operation Shark. Believing that the bombers were being sheltered in Tel Aviv, every dwelling and building was searched for members of the Lehi and Irgun, and the population questioned.Wilson, p.67 During the operation, a cordon surrounded the city and a curfew was imposed on its inhabitants. To allow the population to buy food and other essentials, the curfew was lifted for two hours every second day, until the end of the operation. The division's three parachute brigades were each given one quarter of the city to cordon and search while the fourth quarter was the responsibility of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, attached to the division for the operation.Wilson, p.68 Over four days each brigade questioned around 100,000 people, and 787 were detained for further questioning. During the searches, five arms dumps were found, containing four machine guns, twenty-three mortars, 176 rifles and pistols, and 127,000 round of ammunition. Also found were ¬£50,000 of forged bearer bonds, forging equipment and a large amount of explosives.Wilson, p.71 The division's next operations were Bream and Eel, searching for arms in Dorot and Ruhama, by the 3rd and 8th Parachute Battalions, and the 9th Airborne Squadron Royal Engineers. The two villages were cordoned at dawn on 28 August. Over the next six days the settlements were searched, during which a large quantity of assorted weapons, including heavy machine guns and mortars, were found.Wilson, pp.79‚Äì80 Over the remaining months of the year the division carried out patrols of the rail and road networks, which were being mined. Some of the mines killed men from the division attempting to disarm them, until orders were issued to blow the mines up rather than disarm them.Wilson, pp.85‚Äì86 Then on 2 December a road mine killed four men from the 2nd Forward Observation Unit (Airborne).Wilson, p.113 A change in command occurred on 13 December when Major General Cassels left the division and was replaced by Eric Bols, now commanding the division for the second time.Wilson, p.86 1947 Between 29 December 1946 and 3 January the division's brigades carried out seven search operations in Tel Aviv, arresting 191 people.Charters, p.121 On 2 January several attacks were made on roads in the division's area. One attack wounded eight men of the 4th and 5th Parachute Battalions. Another attack on the same day was carried out by the Lehi against the 1st Parachute Battalion headquarters in Tel Aviv, killing a Jewish policeman and wounding two soldiers and another police officer.Wilson, pp.90‚Äì91 Then on 18 January the 6th Airborne and 1st Infantry Division swapped locations, the airborne division now assuming responsibility for the north of the country.Charters, p.89 Although it remained part of the division, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was withdrawn to England on 24 January.Wilson, p.92 Upon their arrival in the north, the 1st Parachute Brigade assumed responsibility for the District of Galilee, and the 3rd Parachute Brigade for the District of Haifa,Cole, p.208 with division headquarters located in the Stella Maris Monastery.Wilson, p.97 The 1st Parachute Brigade also took under its command the Transjordan Frontier Force and a battalion of the Arab Legion to cover their large area.Wilson, p.100 In the north the division was mainly responsible for the security of the port of Haifa, the largest in the country, where they protected oil installations, the Mosul-Haifa oil pipeline and prevented illegal immigrants from landing on the coastline. On 31 January it was announced that all non- essential British civilians were to be evacuated, due to the worsening situation.Wilson, p.102 The evacuation took place from Haifa between 5 and 8 February, under the control of the 8th Parachute Battalion and the Royal Navy.Wilson, p.104 Men of the 6th Airborne Division look at the assorted weapons, ammunitions and equipment discovered in the Jewish settlement of Doroth near Gaza. On 4 May a group of around forty men carried out the Acre Prison break, releasing forty-one Jews and 214 Arabs. At the same time a mortar attack was carried out on the 2nd Parachute Battalion's camp, as a diversion.Wilson, pp.124‚Äì125 The first unit to reach the prison was a platoon from the 1st Parachute Battalion, 35 minutes later. Other men from the battalion and some divisional units were bathing in the sea a short distance from the prison. A truck load of escaping prisoners opened fire on one unit's armoured car. The escaping truck then reached an improvised road block set up by some bathers and crashed under fire.Wilson, pp.125‚Äì126 The division's bathing party killed four attackers, four Jewish and one Arab escapee, and recaptured thirteen Jews. The bathers had eight men wounded during the short battle. While this was going on, the 1st Parachute Brigade was establishing a cordon around Acre and the surrounding area but no further escapees were caught.Wilson, p.127 The next attack was on officers from the 9th Parachute Battalion on 28 June. The officers were dining at a restaurant when two men of the Irgun approached and fired machine guns through the windows. One officer was killed outright while several others were wounded. The officers returned fire and the car the gunmen were escaping in crashed; later examination revealed at least one of them had been wounded.Wilson, p.131 On 19 July two police officers on patrol in Haifa were shot in the back and killed. The following day the 3rd Parachute Brigade cordoned the area and imposed a night time curfew, which was not lifted until 30 July.Wilson, pp.140‚Äì143 Leadership of the division changed again on 19 August, when Major General Hugh Stockwell was given command.Wilson, p.143 In October the British War Office announced the division would be reduced by one brigade. The 3rd Parachute Brigade was disbanded, leaving the 1st Parachute Brigade in Palestine and the 2nd Parachute Brigade in England.Wilson, p.152 The 1st Parachute Brigade assumed responsibility for Haifa and to cover all its commitments the 2nd Battalion Middlesex Regiment was attached to the brigade.Wilson, p.153 At a meeting on 29 November, the United Nations General Assembly decided to end the British Mandate on 1 August 1948\\\\. Palestine would be partitioned into separate Arab and Jewish states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. The Jewish state would have fifty-six per cent of the land with a population of 490,000 Jews and 325,000 Arabs, while the Arab state would have 807,000 Arabs, but only 10,000 Jews. The population of Jerusalem would be around 105,000 Arabs to 100,000 Jews. On 13 December trouble came from another quarter, in the town of Safed, opposite the Golan Heights. Fighting had started between the Arab and Jewish inhabitants. The police requested help from the army and a company from the 8th Parachute Battalion was assigned the task. Arabs fired at the British unit on 21 December without causing any injuries.Wilson, pp.158‚Äì159 1948 Arab irregulars in Palestine, 1947 Tension in the Golan Heights area remained high and on 9 January the Jewish settlements of Dan and Kfar Szold were attacked by Arab irregulars from the Arab Liberation Army, who crossed the border from Syria. The division responded by immediately sending a troop of armoured cars from the 17th/21st Lancers to each village. By the afternoon the 1st Parachute Battalion had joined the battle and air support from the Royal Air Force was called in. The battle ended with the Arabs withdrawing; their casualties are not known. Nine Jews were killed or wounded by the Arabs, the British troops uninjured.Wilson, p.160 To assist in controlling the region, an ad-hoc formation called Craforce was established. Under the command of the division's commander, Royal Artillery Brigadier C. H. Colquhoun, were the division's artillery, the 17th/21st Lancers, the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Battalion Irish Guards.Wilson, p.162 Craforce became involved with breaking up attacks between Arab and Jewish forces. The Arabs did not directly attack the British, but did engage them when British attempted to intervene in an attack on Jewish settlements.Wilson, p.164 In February the Arab Liberation Army, under the command of Fawzi al-Qawuqji, was estimated to be around 10,000 strong. It was believed around 1,000 volunteers from neighbouring Arab states joined each month.Wilson, pp.181‚Äì182 On 18 February it was announced that the 6th Airborne Division would be disbanded when they left Palestine. The 1st Parachute Brigade handed over Haifa to the 1st Guards Brigade on 6 April.Wilson, p.180 Gradually the division's units left the country. The division's last units, comprising part of divisional headquarters, the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Airborne Squadron Royal Engineers, departed on 18 May.Cole, p.209 Aftermath David Ben-Gurion reading out the Israeli Declaration of Independence Since the end of the Second World War, the campaign in the British Mandate of Palestine had cost the British 338 dead. The numbers for the 6th Airborne Division between October 1945 and April 1948 were fifty-eight men dead and 236 wounded due to enemy action, a further ninety-nine men died, from causes not associated with a hostile act.Wilson, p.228 During their searches of Jewish and Arab settlements, men from the division had located 99 mortars, 34 machine guns, 174 sub machine guns, 375 rifles, 391 pistols, 97 land mines, 2,582 hand grenades and 302,530 rounds of ammunition.Wilson, p.250 In February 1948 the 2nd Parachute Brigade moved from England to Germany, becoming part of the British Army of the Rhine.Watson and Rinaldi, p.3 The 6th Airborne Division was disbanded in April 1948, shortly after their return to England, leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade as the only brigade-sized airborne formation in the British Army.Horn, p.26 On 14 May, the day before the end of the British mandate, David Ben-Gurion, chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, announced the establishment of the state of Israel in parts of what was known as the British Mandate of Palestine. The announcement was the catalyst for the start of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War.

Built c. 1880, they are among the first buildings of their type built in the city. The two groups were separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 18, 1989 as Downer Rowhouses (Central Street) and Downer Rowhouses (Adams Street). Description and history Both sets of rowhouses are set on residential streets just south of Broadway, the major thoroughfare through the Winter Hill neighborhood of Somerville. They each consist of five essentially identical (or mirror-image) residences, 2-1/2 stories in height, with a full third floor under their steeply-pitched mansard roofs. Each unit is two bays wide, with the left side a full-height polygonal bay, with narrow side windows and a larger center window. At the mansard level the windows are set under gables; otherwise the windows have brownstone lintels and sills. The entrances are on the right side. They have patterned slate roofs. When these rowhouses were built c. 1880, Winter Hill was a fashionable residential area, populated by large two and three-family houses on generously sized lots. These buildings, among the first rowhouses built in the city, were built by Cutler Downer, a local real estate developer. Similar rowhouses, not as well-preserved as these, were built in a few places elsewhere in the city, notably on Prospect Hill and Spring Hill.

An onward ticket reflects any of these: * a round-trip airline ticket * an airline or train or bus ticket from one country to another * a one-way airline ticket to a country with an onward ticket requirement as a stop-over When required An onward ticket can be required, based on the countries' entry requirements (which may or may not include the onward ticket). Many countries insist a flight ticket be held out from their country, which must be presented upon arrival at immigration. They set this requirement, so that if travellers run out of money, the country is certain that the traveller can depart. In the past, travellers would remain in a country supporting themselves by illicit employment. Without an onward ticket, a traveller may be refused entry to these countries and subsequently placed on the next plane for the destination from where he arrived. However, there are also many states that do not operate this policy and are less strict in the application of the law of the countries' customs.

On arrival in September 1939, the Germans burned the community's rabbi Abraham Mordechaij Maroko alive because he would not burn the Torah scrolls. During the next two years, the Germans sent many of the town's Jews to forced labor camps and forced others to live in a concentrated ghetto. Some Jews were also sent to Belchatow. Eventually, most of Widawa's Jews were sent to the Chelmno killing camp where they were immediately gassed. Few survived the war.
