It was recorded at the Family Dog concert hall in San Francisco on April 18, 1970. It was released by Rhino Records on November 29, 2013. The album was produced as a single-disc CD, and also as a two-disc vinyl LP, the latter in a limited audiophile edition of 7,500 copies. The concert was a \\"stealth\\" performance by the Grateful Dead, who were billed as \\"Mickey Hart and His Heartbeats\\" and \\"Bobby Ace and His Cards from the Bottom of the Deck\\", a reference to band members Mickey Hart and Bob Weir. The band performed one set of acoustic music, including some rarely played tunes. They were joined on some songs by John Dawson and David Nelson of the New Riders of the Purple Sage. The last six songs of the concert were performed solo by Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan, singing and playing an acoustic guitar. Production The recording used to create the Family Dog album was not known to the Grateful Dead or their fans until Carolyn \\"Mountain Girl\\" Garcia, ex- wife of Jerry Garcia, found some of Jerry's old tapes, and gave them to the band's organization. Among the tapes was this performance, which was then digitally remastered using modern techniques. A notice on the album cover says, \\"This rare recording was made on a non-professional machine at low level and contains some tape hiss and other undesirable stuff. Several procedures were employed to clarify the sound, but artifacts may still be heard. However, the music shines through, and the performance is too good not to bring to you.

Wakai (born May 14, 1967) is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate since January 2011 representing District 15. Wakai consecutively served in the Hawaii State Legislature where he served from 2003 until 2011 in the Hawaii House of Representatives District 31 seat.  Childhood  Glenn Wakai was given up by his teenage birth mother for adoption 47 years ago. Wakai was adopted by a Japanese-American couple in Hawaii when he was about 18 months old. While he later learned that he had been adopted, he never sought to find his birth mother out of consideration for his adoptive parents. Two years ago, when his adopted mother died of illness, Wakai's father gave him a passport. It was made out to Mitsuru Shimabukuro and had a photo of Wakai as an infant. When his father died, Wakai decided to seek out his birth mother. He was helped by his wife, Miki, who is originally from Japan. That was one of the important factors that got the wheels turning for last year's reunion. Not only was his wife a Japanese who could help locate the organization in Japan that handled the adoption, but his birth mother had also married an American, which meant there would be no language barrier when they met. Wakai's birth mother, Yoko Boughton, and her American husband were living in Okinawa, but flew to Hawaii for the special reunion last year. Yoko had gone to Tokyo to become a beautician when she gave birth when she was 16. She initially planned to raise the child herself, but her relatives strongly opposed the decision. Bitterly disappointed, she returned to Okinawa without the baby. She gave birth to a boy she named \\"Mitsuru,\\" with the hope that he would have a \\"fulfilling\\" life as his name means. Education Wakai earned his BAs in broadcast journalism and sociology from the University of Southern California. Elections * 2012 Wakai was unopposed for both the August 11, 2012 Democratic Primary, winning with 5,478 votes, and the November 6, 2012 General election. * 2002 When Democratic Representative Nathan Suzuki retired and left the House District 31 seat open, Wakai won the September 21, 2002 Democratic Primary with 1,975 votes (49.8%), and won the November 5, 2002 General election with 4,393 votes (58.2%) against Republican nominee Brad Sakamoto. who had been redistricted from District 6. * 2004 Wakai was unopposed for the September 18, 2004 Democratic Primary, winning with 3,056 votes, and won the November 2, 2004 General election with 4,841 votes (59.7%) against Republican nominee Kaipo Duncan. * 2006 Wakai was unopposed for the September 26, 2006 Democratic Primary, winning with 3,986 votes, and won the November 7, 2006 General election with 5,024 votes (76.7%) against Yvonne Perry. * 2008 Wakai was unopposed for both the September 20, 2008 Democratic Primary, winning with 3,141 votes, and the November 4, 2008 General election. * 2010 When Democratic Senator Norman Sakamoto ran for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii and left the Senate District 15 seat open, Wakai was unopposed for the September 18, 2010 Democratic Primary, winning with 5,848 votes, and won the November 2, 2010 General election with 7,753 votes (62.4%) against Republican nominee Ben Pascua. Social Activities Glenn Wakai is President of non government organization Reach Out Pacific. State microbe legislation In 2014, Wakai proposed SB3124 which attempted to establish Aliivibrio fischeri as the state microbe of Hawaii. This was opposing state representative James Tokioka's bill from the previous year, HB 293 HD1, to establish Flavobacterium akiainvivens as the state microbe. Neither one succeeded.

He was from a group of people called 'Ikale' a sub tribe of the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria. Oba Feyisara Odimayo, the Jagboju VIII and Olofun of Ode-Irele ascended the throne of Ode Irele five years after his predecessor Oba Aladetubokanwa died. He was the 12th king with the title 'Olofun of Irele'. Oba Feyisara Odimayo descended from a long line of Jagbojus, a ruling house in Irele. Irele, a town located in the eastern part of Ondo State within the Okitipupa division was a place people looked up to for modern education. Irele also generated the highest amount of income tax for Ikale Local Government. Oba Feyisara Odimayo's accession to the throne was controversial. Ode-Irele has three ruling houses; Jagboju, Oyenusi and Orunbemekun. Each ruling house takes turns in Kingship. According to traditional law, once a (Oba)king dies, it is the turn of a representative from the next ruling house to be King. The Ruling Families had rotational turns on the Irele throne. Between 1971 and 1976, there were disputes between the Oyenusi ruling house and the Jagboju ruling house about whose turn it was to ascend the Irele throne. After court appeals, the Kingmakers of the district, the Chief Judge of Ondo State, the Commissioner of Local Government and Chieftaincy affairs and the Governor of Ondo State declared Oba Odimayo the rightful heir to the Irele throne. Oba Odimayo assisted in the establishment of Irele Community High School in September, 1978. Oba Odimayo was also the President of the Ikale Local Government council in Ondo State, Nigeria. Oba Odimayo's reign in Ode-Irele was successful and had a large economic growth impact in the community. Oba Odimayo's reign saw the establishment of Barclay's Bank (November 1, 1978) in Ode-irele, currently called the Union Bank of Nigeria. Barclay's bank was formerly called Colonial Bank (1917) during the British colonial era. Oba Feyisara Odimayo's rule also saw the launch of Mother Therese's Catholic Hospital on May 31, 1978 which oversaw the health welfare of the community. Oba Odimayo's reign also saw deep financial crisis in 1983 but was resolved after all local Chiefs and Oba's readjusted their financial budget in the Ikale Local Government. Oba Feyisara Odimayo had eleven wives and thirty six children.

The town is approximately the halfway point between Bandera and Kerrville along SH 173 in the Texas Hill Country. History The town of Camp Verde came about from the Old Camp Verde military camp. The town grew around the old Williams community store (opened in 1857), which was built to serve the soldiers stationed at the base. After Williams died in 1858, German immigrant Charles Schreiner acquired the store. After the camp was abandoned, the store continued to operate as a post office to area residents. The first post office opened in 1858, running out of Screiner's store. This post office closed 1866. When the post office reopened in 1887, Charles C. Kelly served as post master. However, this post office was also closed in 1892. Walter S. Nowlin re-established the post office and store in 1899. The Camel Experiment In 1854, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (who later became the president of the Confederacy), pushed for the use of camels by the American Army. The initiative was passed by Congress on March 3, 1855 and the first camels arrived in the area in April 1856. After the fort was deactivated in 1869, the experiment died with it. Camp Verde General Store The Camp Verde General Store is still in operation to this day, having been in operation for over 150 years. The store has become somewhat of a tourist attraction in the area. The store also runs the post office and operates a restaurant. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

It is played in the key of F major. It was recorded by Fletcher Henderson in 1926 and Frankie Trumbauer in 1927. Original recording The original RCA Victor 1918 recording by the Original Dixieland Jass Band is described as a \\"small-combo ensemble piece with strong links to the march tradition\\". It was dominated by Larry Shields's solo on clarinet, accompanied by Henry Ragas. \\"Clarinet Marmalade\\" was one of the landmark compositions of early jazz and was a very popular jazz standard in the 1920s; the Original Dixieland Jass Band's sound was widely emulated during this period. In 1919, the song became a staple of the touring James Reese Europe band. The songwriting credit on the original 1918 ODJB release lists Larry Shields and Henry Ragas as the composers. Fletcher Henderson and Frankie Trumbauer recordings Fletcher Henderson's 1926 recording increased the popularity of the tune. He is credited with \\"transforming it into a vehicle for hot soloists and ensemble riffs, including a new introduction and the streamlining omission of several transitional passages.\\" Henderson's version of \\"Clarinet Marmalade\\" was an inspiration for several standards of the period such as \\"Sugar Foot Stomp\\" and \\"King Porter Stomp\\". It was recorded in the 1927-1929 period by musicians such as Berlyn Baylor, Ted Lewis, Phil Napoleon, Lud Gluskin and Bill Carlsen. Frankie Trumbauer and his orchestra, featuring Bix Beiderbecke, first recorded a version of the tune in February 1927 to much success. Richard Hadlock has cited Trumbauer's \\"Clarinet Marmalade\\" as \\"a triumph in terms of logical overall structure, melodic symmetry and rhythmic drive, a most extraordinary jazz recording\\" and opines that Beiderbecke's palette of color through his use of ninths, elevenths and thirteenths and substitution of scales for arpeggios was \\"about three decades ahead of 1927\\". Henderson in turn re-recorded \\"Clarinet Marmalade\\" in March 1931, inspired in part by Trumbauer's take on it, but with the restoration of the original introduction. Bill Challis's recording represented a \\"medium\\" between the different versions, and he also transcribed the piece. Compilation album A compilation album of the same name was released in 1994 featuring \\"25 Great Jazz Clarinetists\\" such as Benny Goodman, Johnny Dodds, Artie Shaw, Sidney Bechet, Pee Wee Russell, Woody Herman and others. Other recordings Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke, Sydney Bechet, Benny Goodman , Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller have recorded the tune. Notably, Armstrong's interest in the tune started in New Orleans when he learned the clarinet solo from the original record in addition to the clarinet obbligato of \\"High Society,\\" which helped to shape his music vocabulary. The New Orleans Rhythm Kings released it as a 78 single. Nick LaRocca and the Original Dixieland Band released a version in 1936. Bunk Johnson, Sid Phillips, Irving Fazola and his Orchestra, Bud Jacobson, Harry Roy, Joe Daniels and His Hot Shots, Milton Mezz Mezzrow, Len Barnard and His South City Stompers, and Wild Bill Davison also recorded it.

In 1918, he graduated from Morristown School (now Morristown- Beard School) in Morristown, NJ. Choate then received his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in Cambridge, MA in 1922. While at Harvard, he studied art history under Paul J. Sachs and Edward W. Forbes and painting under Denman Ross. During his studies, Choate served as an officer of the Harvard Lampoon, a humor magazine. He also served as president of the Morristown School Club, an affinity group for graduates of the school attending Harvard. In 1921, Harvard awarded Choate the Bowers Prize in fine arts for the \\"best drawing, made directly from nature, by an undergraduate in any of the courses in Fine Arts\\". The prize carried an honorarium of $25 (a sizable amount for the time). In 1937, Choate designed the medal of Harvard's Signet Society, which they present to alumni who have made significant achievements in the arts. After graduating from Harvard, Choate studied figure painting at the Académie Julian in Paris, France. He also took classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumiere and the Académie Delécluse. After visiting Greece, Choate shifted his main artwork interest from portraits and murals to sculpture. He returned to the Boston area to study sculpture under Harvard professor John A. Wilson. While residing in Boston, Choate served as the art editor of The Youth's Companion, a children's magazine, until 1927. Five years later, Choate spent time traveling Morocco and the Sudan. This experience influenced much of his later artwork. In 1938, Choate taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts' Summer School in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania. He also taught students privately. Artistic achievements In 1937, the Architectural League of New York awarded Choate their gold medal for design and craftsmanship in stone carving. Conferring the award, the society noted his \\"excellence in the craft of stone carving and design\\". The honor earned Choate sculpting commissions to craft a bas-relief for the Federal Building's doors at the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows and a relief for the U.S. Post Office in Pitman, NJ.Artists & Architects: Nathaniel Choate A New Deal grant from the U.S. Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts funded his design of the post office's \\"Four Winds\\" relief.Pitman Post Office “Four Winds” Bas Relief – Pitman NJ \\"This plaster relief in the Pitman Post Office was created by Nathaniel Choate in 1936 with Treasury Section of Fine Arts funds.\\" Achieving notoriety, Choate created emblems of the Four Evangelists for the Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial run by the American Battle Monuments Commission. He sculpted a bust of Massachusetts Governor Robert F. Bradford and crafted a group of fish in aluminum for the SS United States's main lounge. Built in 1952, the luxury ocean liner sought to capture the trans- Atlantic speed record. In 1964, Choate designed a medal of Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story for a series by the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in New York.The Hall of Fame for Great Americans at New York City He also crafted the bronze medallion that decorated the headquarters of the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company (now JPMorgan Chase) at 34th Street in Manhattan. Brooklyn mural In 1962, Choate and ceramicist Francis Von Tury created a mural for New York City Community College, which now operates as the New York City College of Technology (City Tech). The 33 foot by 17 foot mosaic portrayed six figures to symbolize the school's activities in health, athletics, recreation, competition, drama, and music. Choate's mural stood for 53 years until City Tech razed the building it adorned in 2013 to construct a new educational complex. Seeking to save the mural, activist Robert Holden from Queens and his colleagues spearheaded a campaign in the summer of 2013. After Holden contacted the Board of Trustees of the City University of New York system, they elected to preserve the mural in storage. Greenwich Village home Choate owned a four-story home at 237 West West Fourth Street in Greenwich Village, a historical hub of artistic creativity. While living there, he painted murals of Haiti and Trinidad for the Calypso at 146 Macdougal Street, a restaurant that served Caribbean cuisine. In 1957, Choate sold the property to realtors Lloyd Hauser and J. P. Sloane. They planned to house a group of four young sculptors.

The HP virus is classified in the Rhabdoviridae family and is related to the viral agents that cause rabies and vesicular stomatitis. The exact date of discovery of this virus is uncertain, but its presence in the entomological community dates back as far as 1964. Because of its relatively recent discovery, its exact effect on hosts is uncertain. Currently, there is no known disease affiliated with the Hart Park virus.  Transmission  The western encephalitis mosquito, or Culex tarsalis, is one of the common mosquito vectors for the HP virus because of its prevalence in North America. Wild birds are the most frequent host of the HP virus because they are the target of blood-feeding Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes. Female Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes primarily feed on birds but in late summer, their blood feeding on larger mammals such as man increases. The host transition from birds to humans plays a huge role in the potential for widespread viral infections of the HP virus and similar strains. One important find from recent studies, is that the HP virus seems unable to be transmitted transovarially from infected females to their offspring. This restricts the direct spread of the virus because the progeny do not inherit the Hart Park virus from their maternal parent. The Hart Park virus does not currently have a disease related to its infection in other animals, but its transmission through feral birds is a cause for concern. The West Nile virus transmission cycle is similar to the putative Hart Park virus transmission cycle.  Symptoms  Symptoms specific to the HP virus in humans have not been conclusive, however; symptoms of RNA viruses include: hepatitis, encephalitis, mild fever, and hemorrhagic fever. The primary hosts for the HP virus are wild birds. This make it harder to distinguish the warning signs of a possible HP infection.  Flanders virus  The Flanders virus is similar to the antigentic make-up of the Hart Park virus. Both the HP and Flanders viruses are part of the Rhabdoviridae family and are both agents of Culex mosquitoes. The Flanders virus was named after the town in which it was first discovered in 1960. This town, in New York is a hamlet that provides the ideal habitat for mosquitoes because of its relatively long coastline. The access to large standing bodies of water are perfect nesting grounds for the Culex mosquitoes to begin laying eggs, away from potential predators. Similarly, the Flanders virus typically infects wild birds. The primary targets of the Flanders virus are red-winged blackbirds, house sparrows, and starlings.  Prevention  The routine prevention technique practiced by experts is isolation from potentially infected organisms, primarily feral birds and mosquitoes. It remains unclear whether the HP virus can spread to a new host posthumously, but professionals advise to avoid any deceased animals found in the wild. Mosquitoes pose a constant threat toward the transmission of the HP virus due to their wide range of hosts.  References  Johnson, Harald N. \\"DigitalCommons.\\" Site.

Louis-Dreyfus has been critically acclaimed for the role, earning a record-breaking six consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series awards and five Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy nominations. Meyer is a former United States Senator and the Vice President of the United States following an unsuccessful run for President. During the first season, as Vice President she was powerless and disregarded by most other important officials, leading to various humiliations and indignities. During the second season she begins to amass some power and influence. In the third season, she contemplates challenging the incumbent president for their unnamed party's nomination in light of his political weakness, but the issue is mooted when he abruptly resigns, allowing her to become the president. In the fourth season, she has assumed office but is facing strong primary and general-election challengers of her own. The general election results in a tie, setting the stage for the fifth season, as the United States House of Representatives prepares to choose the president. She ultimately loses, but spends the sixth and seventh seasons clawing her way back into the White House. The role garnered Louis-Dreyfus several milestone accolades: her fourteenth Primetime Emmy Award nomination for a role in the regular cast of a comedy series surpassed Lucille Ball as the most ever. Her Primetime Emmy Award for her third different regular cast role also was a record-setting achievement for a comedy actress. Her six consecutive Primetime Emmy Lead Actress wins set a record, as did her seven overall Primetime Emmy Lead Actress nominations. Fictional biography Meyer was born Selina Catherine Eaton to mother Catherine Calvert Eaton and Gordon Dunn Eaton. In her childhood, she loved her father (whom she affectionately called Daddy), but resented her narcissistic mother. It is later revealed that Selina's father was an adulterer who died from a heart attack while having sex with his secretary, and that her mother only stayed with him to provide for her. In fact, it was her father's secretary (childless due to their affairs and a series of pressured abortions) who acted most like a parent towards Selina, giving her a childhood snow-globe collection as a surrogate child. Selina attended Smith College and Yale Law School. As a young woman, she married Andrew Meyer, a shady real estate developer, with whom she has a daughter, Catherine. She eventually divorces Andrew for repeatedly cheating on her, and shows little (if any) maternal instinct towards her daughter. The show's original opening sequence details some of her career. She was a United States Senator from Maryland (where she was born and raised). Furthering her connection to the state of Maryland, the first season established Meyer as being a fan of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens and she also hosted an event at Oriole Park at Camden Yards the home field of MLB's Baltimore Orioles. She announced her candidacy for the 2012 presidential election. Media outlets initially praised her and had high hopes for her becoming the President, with headlines such as \\"Magic Meyer\\" and \\"Is this Meyer's Moment?\\". Despite strong initial victories, she ultimately is defeated by primary challenger Stuart Hughes on Super Tuesday, and suspends her campaign. He then selects her as his running mate, and is elected to the presidency. As the Vice President, Meyer finds herself increasingly ignored by the President, and often demoted to trivial matters. When the sitting President decides that he will not seek a second term, his Chief of Staff Ben Cafferty encourages Meyer to run, which she ultimately does. She faces a primary challenge from war veteran and Governor of Minnesota Danny Chung, Secretary of Defense George Maddox, freshman Congressman Owen Pierce, and baseball coach Joe Thornhill. During the course of the primary season, President Hughes resigns abruptly to care for his ailing wife, and Meyer ascends to the presidency. Headlines question whether Meyer will be \\"the 8-month president\\", confirming that Hughes' term was near over, and Meyer is constitutionally eligible to serve two full terms as President. Though she chooses Senator Andrew Doyle to become her Vice President, he declines to serve as her running mate for a full term as Vice President. She offers the running mate position to both Chung and Maddox, but both decline, and she ultimately chooses popular Senator Tom James when she secures the party nomination. Meyer is challenged in the general election by Southern Senator Bill O'Brien. The election ends in an Electoral College tie, but with Meyer having won the popular vote. After an ambiguous result in Nevada, the Meyer campaign successfully lobbies for a recount. The recount backfires, and O'Brien keeps Nevada as a victory, as well as overtakes the popular vote. Congress must then decide who will be the President. After the House of Representatives fails to elect the President, Meyer agrees to be Vice President for her running mate Tom James. However the Senate instead elects O'Brien's running mate Laura Montez as Vice President, with Vice President Doyle as President of the Senate casting the deciding vote in favour of Montez to become Secretary of State after Meyer broke her promise to appoint him to the position. Due to the tied vote in the House, the office of the President is left vacant, meaning that Vice President Montez immediately ascends to the presidency. As a result, James makes plans to return to the private sector while Meyer, now completely out of office, contemplates her future. It is mentioned throughout the final two seasons that she went to an insane asylum during the year after her loss in the House vote. Throughout the sixth season, which is set in 2018, Selina Meyer begins her presidential memoir with the help of her ghostwriter Mike McLintock. She also enlists several of her former aides with help running her namesake charity, The Meyer Fund for Adult Literacy, AIDS, the Advancement of Global Democracy, Military Family Assistance, & Childhood Obesity. As part of her work with democracy, she supervises Georgian elections in which both sides offer to bribe her. Meyer believes that President Montez will nominate her to be a justice on the Supreme Court; instead, former president Hughes is nominated. She also begins working on trying to secure a place for her library; although Smith College initially accepts, the college turns her down due to controversies resulting the firing of her painter because she had sex with Andrew Meyer. McLintock loses his diary detailing the Meyer presidency, leading to The Washington Post releasing bombshell stories surrounding controversies in her administration; this is quickly overshadowed by the revelation that it was the Meyer team that had participated in talks regarding the freedom of Tibet. This wave of support leads Meyer to conclude that she has a political future, and she declares her run for president in 2019. In 2019, she begins running a fierce campaign against Representative Jonah Ryan (a former member of Meyer's staff), James, and Nevada Governor Buddy Calhoun. In trying to attract large-scale fundraisers, she inadvertently influences Senator Kemi Talbot to run as well. She enlists much of her old team, with the notable addition of her campaign manager Keith Quinn, who has suspicious ties to the Chinese government. During the first primary debate, she creates the slogan \\"Man Up!\\" in response to Senator Talbot; also, it comes to light that her ex-husband Andrew committed several crimes, such as embezzlement, with funds from The Meyer Fund. Though Meyer loses Iowa, she wins New Hampshire; in South Carolina, however, she faces a demographic disadvantage. She enlists the help of the Chinese government with the help of Quinn, who uses voter suppression techniques in African-American neighborhoods in the state, leading to her victory. Quinn also orders Andrew's murder; it is hinted at throughout the latter half of the season that Andrew survived. Meyer, on a trip to Norway to receive recognition from the Nobel Committee for her work in Tibet, receives an extradition warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes after it is revealed she ordered a drone strike on a wedding in Pakistan. She escapes with the help of Murman Shalikashvili, one of the candidates in the Georgian election; she also has immense American support before the revelation that the drone strike killed an elephant. During the series finale, she wins the brokered convention of her party in Charlotte by offering Ryan the vice presidency to get his delegates and opposing same-sex marriage to get those of the socially conservative Calhoun; the latter causes a permanent rift between her and Catherine, a lesbian who is married to Marjorie, Selina’s former Secret Service detail. She also frames Gary for impropriety with the Meyer Fund. Ultimately, she wins the nomination and the presidency. Meyer's final, single presidential term is shaky and lonely; she has no friends during this time, and her presidency is politely described as “underrated”. She dies in 2045 at the age of 78, and her funeral is attended by her close associates, who remember the Meyer years as a turbulent time. Coverage of her funeral is upstaged by the death of Tom Hanks the same day. Character Julia Louis- Dreyfus who plays fictional Vice President of the United States Selina Meyer, with Joe Biden, the (then) real Vice President of the United States. The show's premise is that Meyer is a former United States Senator who runs a failed Presidential campaign before being asked to be the winning candidate's Vice President. As Vice President, her world is kept in balance by her assistants: Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky) is the Vice President's chief of staff, while Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) is Meyer's grovelling personal aide. Selina also hires Dan Egan (Reid Scott), who threatens Amy's place in the staff, and Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh), a press spokesman. Meyer has no significant other, and requires that her daughter Catherine, from a past marriage, make appointments to see her. Some suggest that Meyer is likely a Republican, while others feel she is a Democrat. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes that Meyer's party affiliation is unknown because the show focuses on bullying and ego rather than ideology. James Poniewozik of Time explains the ambiguity as follows: Veep is \\"almost all politics and almost no political issues\\". Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times explains the lack of need for party affiliations, or even political ideology in a similar manner, saying that Veep is \\"less a show about politics than about politicking.\\" In an interview with The New Yorker Radio Hour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus suggested that Meyer's associated political party is intentionally left unknown to the audience. Louis-Dreyfus later elaborated: \\"[Selina Meyer's] politics are all about her and staying alive ... she will hold any position if it keeps her in office.\\" In the episode Election Night, CNN represents states won by Meyer as blue. In the same episode, she also comments winning the 'blue wall' states of Connecticut and Vermont with \\"A bowl of hair could win those states\\". However, in the finale of the season, she is seen as running for her party's nomination against Buddy Calhoun, whose political views, especially his opposition to same-sex marriage, appear to be more conservative in nature. Poniewozik describes the season 1 Meyer as a \\"bumbling and overwhelmed\\" shadow of her former self. Merissa Marr of The Wall Street Journal describes Meyer as \\"inept\\". James Parker of The New York Times describes her as animated, powerless, prone to fits, and at times distracted. He notes that she motorcades and entourages with importance, but also passes time rotating dreamily in her swivel chair. Parker opines that Meyer \\"swears her head off\\" because that is what the modern \\"gaffe-phobic, linguistically constipated\\" public servant who has sold his/her soul to a lobbyist group does behind closed doors after public speeches about \\"ceaseless, toneless platitudes\\". Variety television critic Brian Lowry describes Meyer as \\"easily flustered, foul-mouthed\\", saying that her \\"over-reliance on profanity\\" is a comedic crutch. David Renshaw of The Guardian describes Meyer as \\"a perfect combination of ineptness and amorality\\". T. A. Frank of The New Republic says that in season 1 she is completely ignored by the president and dismissed by Congress as she endures repeated indignities with a high degree of cynicism. According to Frank, Meyer slowly gains some respect and power, but it is not without effort. Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker, noted that the premise of a politician without influence striving for it suited itself well to a comedy and that her frequent cursing should not have been much of an issue given that it was an HBO production. Laura Bennett of The New Republic states that in season 1 Meyer is \\"a hapless buffoon, fluffing her hair and running in circles\\", who endures marginalization and irrelevance, but in season 2, which is set during midterm elections, she is \\"a player in the administration with concrete involvement in foreign policy\\". Reception Louis-Dreyfus in 2012 The role has established Louis-Dreyfus as the all-time most Primetime Emmy Award decorated actress in terms of regular cast roles in a comedy series (i.e., not counting guest acting Emmys). It is the third character (after Elaine Benes on Seinfeld and Christine Campbell on The New Adventures of Old Christine ) for which Louis-Dreyfus has earned a Primetime Emmy Award (Outstanding Lead Actress or Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series).

The season 5 performance earned a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series at the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards, which she ultimately won and dedicated to her recently deceased father. The win gave her the record of five consecutive wins in the category, surpassing Hunt as well as six total wins in the category surpassing Bergen and Moore. She received acting nominations at the 32nd TCA Awards. and 7th Critics' Choice Television Awards. She also wins again for the Female Actor in a Comedy Series and nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series at the 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards as well as Best Actress – Television Series Comedy at the 74th Golden Globe Awards.

Ancient physicians in many parts of the world mixed cannabis into medicines to treat pain and other ailments. In the 19th century, cannabis was introduced for therapeutic use in Western Medicine. Since then, there have been several advancements in how the drug is administered. Initially, cannabis was reduced to a powder and mixed with wine for administration. In the 1970s, synthetic THC was created to be administered as the drug Marinol in a capsule. However, the main mode of administration for cannabis is smoking because its effects are almost immediate when the smoke is inhaled. Between 1996 and 1999, eight U.S. states supported cannabis prescriptions opposing policies of the federal government. Most people who are prescribed marijuana for medical purposes use it to alleviate severe pain.  Ancient China  \\"Dàmá\\", the Chinese word for \\"cannabis\\", compounds \\"big; great\\" and \\"cannabis; hemp.\\" Cannabis, called má 麻 (meaning \\"hemp; cannabis; numbness\\") or dàmá 大麻 (with \\"big; great\\") in Chinese, was used in Taiwan for fiber starting about 10,000 years ago. The botanist Hui-lin Li wrote that in China, \\"The use of Cannabis in medicine was probably a very early development. Since ancient humans used hemp seed as food, it was quite natural for them to also discover the medicinal properties of the plant.\\"Li, Hui-Lin (1974). \\"An Archaeological and Historical Account of Cannabis in China\\", Economic Botany 28.4:437–448, p. 444.

The early Chinese surgeon Hua Tuo (c. 140-208) is credited with being the first recorded person to use cannabis as an anesthetic. He reduced the plant to powder and mixed it with wine for administration prior to conducting surgery. The Chinese term for \\"anesthesia\\" (mázui 麻醉) literally means \\"cannabis intoxication\\". Elizabeth Wayland Barber says the Chinese evidence \\"proves a knowledge of the narcotic properties of Cannabis at least from the 1st millennium B.C.\\" when ma was already used in a secondary meaning of \\"numbness; senseless.\\" \\"Such a strong drug, however, suggests that the Chinese pharmacists had now obtained from far to the southwest not THC-bearing Cannabis sativa but Cannabis indica, so strong it knocks you out cold.Barber, Elizabeth Wayland.

Ancient Netherlands  In 2007, a late Neolithic grave attributed to the Beaker culture (found near , Gelderland; dated 2459-2203 BCE) was found containing an unusually large concentration of pollen. After five years of careful investigation these pollen were concluded to be mostly cannabis along with a smaller amount of meadowsweet. Due to the fever-reducing properties of meadowsweet, the archeologists speculated that the person in the grave had likely been very ill, in which case the cannabis would have served as painkiller.Cannabis van 4200 jaar oud in graf Hanzelijn (Dutch), NU.nl  Ancient Egypt  The Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BC) from Ancient Egypt has a prescription for medical marijuana applied directly for inflammation. The Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BC) from Ancient Egypt describes medical cannabis. Other ancient Egyptian papyri that mention medical cannabis are the Ramesseum III Papyrus (1700 BC), the Berlin Papyrus (1300 BC) and the Chester Beatty Medical Papyrus VI (1300 BC). The ancient Egyptians used hemp (cannabis) in suppositories for relieving the pain of hemorrhoids. Around 2,000 BCE, the ancient Egyptians used cannabis to treat sore eyes.(Webley, Kayla. \\"Brief History: Medical Marijuana.\\" Time 21 June 2010.) The egyptologist Lise Manniche notes the reference to \\"plant medical cannabis\\" in several Egyptian texts, one of which dates back to the eighteenth century BCE.Lise Manniche, An Ancient Egyptian Herbal, University of Texas Press, 1989,  Ancient India  Cannabis was a major component in religious practices in ancient India as well as in medicinal practices. For many centuries, most parts of life in ancient India incorporated cannabis of some form. Surviving texts from ancient India confirm that cannabis' psychoactive properties were recognized, and doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and ailments. These included insomnia, headaches, a whole host of gastrointestinal disorders, and pain: cannabis was frequently used to relieve the pain of childbirth. One Indian philosopher expressed his views on the nature and uses of bhang (a form of cannabis), which combined religious thought with medical practices. \\"A guardian lives in the bhang leaf. …To see in a dream the leaves, plant, or water of bhang is lucky. …A longing for bhang foretells happiness. It cures dysentery and sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens digestion, sharpens appetite, makes the tongue of the lisper plain, freshens the intellect and gives alertness to the body and gaiety to the mind. Such are the useful and needful ends for which in His goodness the Almighty made bhang.\\"  Ancient Greece  The Ancient Greeks used cannabis not only for human medicine, but also in veterinary medicine to dress wounds and sores on their horses. The Ancient Greeks used cannabis to dress wounds and sores on their horses. In humans, dried leaves of cannabis were used to treat nose bleeds, and cannabis seeds were used to expel tapeworms. The most frequently described use of cannabis in humans was to steep green seeds of cannabis in either water or wine, later taking the seeds out and using the warm extract to treat inflammation and pain resulting from obstruction of the ear. In the 5th century BC Herodotus, a Greek historian, described how the Scythians of the Middle East used cannabis in steam baths. These baths drove the people to a frenzied state.  Medieval Islamic world  In the medieval Islamic world, Arabic physicians made use of the diuretic, antiemetic, antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties of Cannabis sativa, and used it extensively as medication from the 8th to 18th centuries. Cannabis sativa from Vienna Dioscurides, 512 AD  Modern history  An advertisement for Maltos-Cannabis, a Scandinavian cannabis-based drink popular in the early 20th century. In the mid 19th century, medical interest in the use of cannabis began to grow in the West. In the 19th century cannabis was one of the secret ingredients in several so called patent medicines. There were at least 2000 cannabis medicines prior to 1937, produced by over 280 manufacturers.The Antique Cannabis Book. antiquecannabisbook.com (16 March 2012). Retrieved 2012-05-19. The advent of the syringe and injectable medicines contributed to an eventual decline in the popularity of cannabis for therapeutic uses, as did the invention of new drugs such as aspirin. An Irish physician, William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, is credited with introducing the therapeutic use of cannabis to Western medicine. He was Assistant-Surgeon and Professor of Chemistry at the Medical College of Calcutta, and conducted a cannabis experiment in the 1830s, first testing his preparations on animals, then administering them to patients to help treat muscle spasms, stomach cramps or general pain. Modern medical and scientific inquiry began with doctors like O'Shaughnessy and Moreau de Tours, who used it to treat melancholia and migraines, and as a sleeping aid, analgesic and anticonvulsant. At the local level authorities introduced various laws that required the mixtures that contained cannabis, that was not sold on prescription, must be marked with warning labels under the so-called poison laws. In 1905 Samuel Hopkins Adams published an exposé entitled \\"The Great American Fraud\\" in Collier's Weekly about the patent medicines that led to the passage of the first Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. This statute did not ban alcohol, narcotics, and stimulants in the medicines; rather, it required medicinal products to be labeled as such and curbed some of the more misleading, overstated, or fraudulent claims that previously appeared on labels. At the turn of the 20th century the Scandinavian maltose- and cannabis-based drink Maltos-Cannabis was widely available in Denmark and Norway. Promoted as \\"an excellent lunch drink, especially for children and young people\\", the product had won a prize at the Exposition Internationale d'Anvers in 1894. A Swedish encyclopedia from 1912 claim that European hemp, the raw material for Maltos-Sugar, almost lacked the narcotic effect that is typical for Indian hemp and that products from Indian hemp was abandon by modern science for medical use. Maltos-Cannabis was promoted with text about its content of maltose sugar. An advertisement for cannabis americana distributed by a pharmacist in New York in 1917 Later in the century, researchers investigating methods of detecting cannabis intoxication discovered that smoking the drug reduced intraocular pressure. In 1955 the antibacterial effects were described at the Palacký University of Olomouc. Since 1971 Lumír Ondřej Hanuš was growing cannabis for his scientific research on two large fields in authority of the University. The marijuana extracts were then used at the University hospital as a cure for aphthae and haze. In 1973 physician Tod H. Mikuriya reignited the debate concerning cannabis as medicine when he published \\"Marijuana Medical Papers\\". High intraocular pressure causes blindness in glaucoma patients, so he hypothesized that using the drug could prevent blindness in patients. Many Vietnam War veterans also found that the drug prevented muscle spasms caused by spinal injuries suffered in battle. In 1964, Dr. Albert Lockhart and Manley West began studying the health effects of traditional cannabis use in Jamaican communities. They discovered that Rastafarians had unusually low glaucoma rates and local fishermen were washing their eyes with cannabis extract in the belief that it would improve their sight. Lockhart and West developed, and in 1987 gained permission to market, the pharmaceutical Canasol: one of the first cannabis extracts. They continued to work with cannabis, developing more pharmaceuticals and eventually receiving the Jamaican Order of Merit for their work.Dr Farid F. Youssef. \\"Cannibis Unmasked: What it is and why it does what it does\\". UWIToday: June 2010. http://sta.uwi.edu/uwitoday/archive/june_2010/article9.asp Later, in the 1970s, a synthetic version of THC was produced and approved for use in the United States as the drug Marinol. It was delivered as a capsule, to be swallowed. Patients complained that the violent nausea associated with chemotherapy made swallowing capsules difficult. Further, along with ingested cannabis, capsules are harder to dose-titrate accurately than smoked cannabis because their onset of action is so much slower. Smoking has remained the route of choice for many patients because its onset of action provides almost immediate relief from symptoms and because that fast onset greatly simplifies titration. For these reasons, and because of the difficulties arising from the way cannabinoids are metabolized after being ingested, oral dosing is probably the least satisfactory route for cannabis administration. Voters in eight U.S. states showed their support for cannabis prescriptions or recommendations given by physicians between 1996 and 1999, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, going against policies of the federal government. In May 2001, \\"The Chronic Cannabis Use in the Compassionate Investigational New Drug Program: An Examination of Benefits and Adverse Effects of Legal Clinical Cannabis\\" (Russo, Mathre, Byrne et al.) was completed. This three-day examination of major body functions of four of the five living US federal cannabis patients found \\"mild pulmonary changes\\" in two patients. Among the more than 108,000 persons in Colorado who in 2012 had received a certificate to use marijuana for medical purposes, 94% said that severe pain was the reason for the requested certificate, followed by 3% for cancer and 1% for HIV/Aids. The typical card holder was a 41-year- old male. Twelve doctors had issued 50% of the certificates. Opponents of the card system claim that most card holders are drug abusers who are faking or exaggerating their illnesses; three-fourths male patients is not the normal pattern for pain patients, it is the normal pattern for drug addicts, claim the critics. After the implementation of medical cannabis in Colorado has also the past 30-day use of marijuana by teens increased significant compared with the average in the U.S. (Prescription to teens is not allowed in Colorado).Medical Marijuana Regulatory System, Part II.

The specific name, Mfumukasi means \\"queen\\" in Nyanja, in honor of the members of the local Nyanja matriarchal society and all Mozambican women. Niassodon is known solely from the holotype ML1620, a partial skeleton which is temporarily housed at the Museu da Lourinhã, Portugal, and will be returned to the Museu Nacional de Geologia, Maputo, Mozambique. The holotype consists of a complete skull, a mandible, series of 19 dorsal, sacral and caudal vertebrae, ribs, both ilia and a partial femur, from a single individual. It was discovered and collected during a 2009 expedition in the Metangula Graben, under the supervision of Projecto PalNiassa. ML1620 came from an unnamed fossiliferous unit located near Tulo, a small village situated along the Metangula-Cóbue road.

When he returned to Pakistan he began playing for Khairpur, with one appearance in 1959–60. He captained Khairpur in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1961–62, beginning the season by taking three wickets and top-scoring in each innings for Khairpur against Bahawalpur – 29 and 53 in a low-scoring match that Khairpur won by eight runs.Bahawalpur v Khairpur 1961–62 It was Khairpur's first victory in first-class competition.

Her young adult novels Eleanor & Park (2012), Fangirl (2013) and Carry On (2015) have been subjects of critical acclaim. She is currently the writer of the 2017 revival of Marvel Comics' Runaways. Career Rowell was a columnist and ad copywriter at the Omaha World-Herald from 1995 to 2012. After leaving her position as a columnist, Rowell began working for an ad agency and writing what would become her first published novel, Attachments, as a pastime. Rowell had a baby during this period and stopped working on the manuscript for two years. The novel, a contemporary romantic comedy about a company's IT guy who falls in love with a woman whose email he has been monitoring, was published in 2011. Kirkus Reviews listed it as one of the outstanding debuts that year. In 2012, Rowell completed the first draft of her young adult novel Fangirl for National Novel Writing Month. In 2013, Rowell published Fangirl and Eleanor & Park, another young adult novel. Both were named by The New York Times as among the best young adult fiction of the year. Eleanor & Park was also chosen by Amazon as one of the 10 best books of 2013, and as Goodreads' best young adult fiction of the year. DreamWorks reverted the rights to make Eleanor & Park into a movie back to Rainbow Rowell. Rowell's work gained some negative attention in 2013 when a parents' group at a Minnesota high school challenged Eleanor & Park and Rowell was disinvited to a library event; a panel ultimately determined that the book could stay on library shelves. Rowell noted in an interview that the material that these parents were calling \\"profane\\" was what many kids in difficult situations realistically had to deal with, and that \\"when these people call Eleanor & Park an obscene story, I feel like they’re saying that rising above your situation isn’t possible.\\" Rowell's fourth novel, Landline, a contemporary adult novel about a marriage in trouble, was released on July 8, 2014. Also in 2014, Rowell signed a two-book deal with First Second to author two young adult graphic novels, the first of which will be illustrated by Faith Erin Hicks. Rowell announced in December 2014 that her fifth book, Carry On, would be published in October 2015. It was published on October 6, 2015. Carry On is based on the book series central to the plot of Fangirl. It acts as the eighth book in a fictional series by Gemma T. Leslie about a boy \\"mage\\" named Simon Snow who attends a \\"magical\\" school called Watford. In his eighth year at school, Simon struggles to come to terms with his calling as the \\"Chosen One\\" meant to destroy the Insidious Humdrum, a magical force destroying the \\"world of mages.\\" He embarks on his quest with his best friend Penelope and his girlfriend Agatha, all the while struggling with T. Basilton \\"Baz\\" Pitch, his vampire nemesis. Although it exists in a fantasy world and within Fangirl was part of a series, the novel is a standalone book. It is influenced by fan fiction, particularly the popularity of fan fiction of the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. On June 3, 2018, Rowell announced via Twitter that she was working on her sixth novel, Wayward Son, a sequel to Carry On, and that it would be published on September 24, 2019. On October 3, 2019, Rowell posted an image of a book cover with the title, \\"Any Way The Wind Blows\\" and the caption \\"coming soon.\\" This book is assumed to be the third in the Simon Snow series, and a sequel to Wayward Son. Rowell has written a screenplay adaptation for Eleanor & Park, which was originally with DreamWorks, although the rights have reverted. Personal life Rowell lives in Omaha, Nebraska, with her husband and two sons.

Early life Tanaka was 13 and living 20 miles from Hiroshima at the time of the 1945 Hiroshima atomic bombing. After his victory, he recalled, \\"We saw a bright light and heard a little noise. But no one thought anything about it at the time... three days later, we heard the terrible news.\\" He laid the groundwork for his career as a marathon runner by running 20 km from Shōbara to a Saijō municipal stadium as a high school student. He was a first-year student at Nihon University at the time of the Boston Marathon. 1951 Boston Marathon Japanese athletes had been barred from the 1948 Summer Olympics in London and from all major international competitions after World War II. The 1951 Boston Marathon was only the second post-World War II athletic competition, after the 1951 Asian Games held a month earlier, to invite Japanese athletes. Tanaka was one of four Japanese runners invited to compete by Will Cloney of the Boston Athletic Association. The others were Japan's national champion Shunji Koyunagi, Yoshitaka Uchikawa, and Hiromi Haigo. At the time, Tanaka was 20 years old, and weighed 118 pounds. The runners stopped in Hawaii, San Francisco and New York City en route to Boston. In each stopover they went to a movie theater and people wrapped money in paper and threw it on stage for them. Tanaka later recalled that he \\"felt pretty strange to receive money like that, like a beggar almost... We brought sugar to bring back to Japan--that's how bad things were.\\" The four were given a welcoming ceremony arranged by servicemen at the Charlestown Naval Shipyard. Because Tanaka was from Hiroshima, The Boston Globe nicknamed him \\"atomic boy\\", which he found \\"a burden\\". Tanaka later recalled that people in the United States welcomed them warmly and both Japanese and Americans cheered him during the race. Tanaka became the Boston Marathon's first Japanese winner. He won the event in 2:27:45, the third fastest time in the event's history to that point. He took the lead on Heartbreak Hill and led convincingly with four miles to go. Observers expected him to break Suh Yun-bok's 1947 course record, but following his pre-race plans, Tanaka stuck to his own schedule; he did not push himself and finished comfortably. After the race, he stated through an interpreter, \\"I did not plan a record-breaking race, I ran only to win.\\" Tanaka won the marathon racing in tabi-inspired split-toe running shoes made by Onitsuka, which he thought would give him better traction. The three other Japanese runners in the race also did very well: Koyunagi finished in 5th place, Uchikawa in 8th place and Haigo in 9th place. Reception and legacy Tanaka's win inspired in Japan an enduring enthusiasm for distance running and an affection for the Boston Marathon. His win was a landmark moment in restoring the war-shattered country's dignity and honor following World War II. The race and Tanaka's victory marked the beginning of a strong athletic relationship between Japan and Boston, and the beginning of a tradition of Japanese victories in the race. Post-running career After his running career, Tanaka worked as a salaryman for a Tokyo area department store and served as a director at the Japanese Amateur Athletics Federation until his retirement. Medal theft On May 5, 1998, Tanaka's house in Utsunomiya was ransacked and his Boston Marathon winner's medal stolen. The Boston Athletic Association awarded Tanaka a replacement medal on July 10, 1998, for his achievement as the first Japanese to win the event; the association's president Frank Porter said in a message accompanying the medal that Tanaka's victory was the beginning of Japan's strength in the race. The stolen medal was recovered in a police raid on July 22, 1998. A 19-year-old Brazilian of Japanese ancestry was arrested on suspicion of stealing the medal and on unrelated theft and assault charges. During questioning, the suspect implicated himself in an unrelated murder and was arrested on suspicion of the crime. The two medals were subsequently displayed at the National Stadium in Tokyo. Tanaka presented the Boston Athletic Association with a \\"trophy of friendship\\" on behalf of the town of Saijō in gratitude for replacing the stolen medal.

Members of the British 1st Airborne Division, training at Netheravon. The Helmet Steel Airborne Troops (HSAT) is a paratrooper helmet of British origin worn by paratroopers and members of airlanding units. It was introduced in Second World War by the British Army and was also used by other Commonwealth armies. It continued to be used in the post-war era – until the Falklands War, in the case of British airborne troops. As with the similarly shaped RAC helmet, it was initially manufactured by Briggs Motor Bodies at Dagenham. Variants The first prototype variant was used during the Bruneval Raid, these came with a rubber padding found on the rear. The helmets were short lived and replaced by the MkI. The first steel helmet was produced at the BMB factory in 1941. These early \\"P Type\\" helmets only numbered between 500 and 1,000 units. The P Type featured a non-magnetic manganese steel shell with a rubberized rim and a lining with interior padding that was similar to the German M36/40 design. Mk I The next step in the evolution of the British helmet came in 1942. This helmet featured a similar shell design, but with a thick vulcanized fiber band rim that clearly distinguishes it from the German model, along with a four-point chinstrap system and a band of sorbo rubber for padding. These earliest helmets used leather chins traps and are considered quite rare. A Mk III HSAT worn by Polish General Stanisław Sosabowski. Mk II Second pattern, came with the same leather chinstraps and a steel rim instead of the fibre rim (issue October 1942). Mk III Third pattern, came with the three-point webbing chinstrap.

Born in Montana, McBride moved to California at the age of 18. His style has been described as \\"jangly hook-laden folk pop\\". He has released 5 solo albums, receiving recognition for both his music and visual arts. Career In 2008, McBride left his hometown of Billings, Montana for San Luis Obispo, California, where he recorded his debut album of original music, From the Mountains to the Sea. The album was followed by a west coast tour and led to the production of a music video for the single \\"1937\\". This initial effort was met with positive reviews and won McBride an award for \\"Best Solo Artist\\" from the popular California publication New Times. In 2010, McBride relocated to Ventura, California to work on material for a follow up to his first album with surf-rock producer Todd Hannigan. After a year of studio work, he released two albums, a full-length record, The Good Fight and a five- song EP, Wild Child. McBride followed the releases with an extensive tour of the west coast. Upon moving to Missoula, Montana in 2011, McBride began producing material for other bands and exploring new directions for his original material. His fourth solo album Every Road I Take, was independently released in 2013. In 2017, McBride independently released his fifth studio album, Cold Water. The recording session took place in Bodega Bay, CA with San Francisco producer Mackenzie Bunch. A limited run of 250 vinyl records were produced and sold at an album release show in San Francisco. The lead single, \\"On The Other Side\\", was picked up by several major music blogs, and earned a feature on Spotify's \\"Weekly Buzz\\", \\"Viral 50 USA\\" (#8), and \\"Viral 50 Global\\" (#14) playlists. The success of the independent release earned McBride nods from some of his songwriting heroes. Impose Magazine stated the album had, \\"An eloquence and authenticity that gently fills a room\\". After touring in support of Cold Water, McBride traveled to London, U.K. to begin work on a new album, Green Shade, projected to release in fall 2017.

Users generally will upload video content via the hosting service's website, mobile or desktop application, or other interface (API). The type of video content uploaded might be anything from shorts to full-length TV shows and movies. The video host stores the video on its server and offers users the ability to enable different types of embed codes or links that allow others to view the video content. The website, mainly used as the video hosting website, is usually called the video sharing website. Purpose of video hosts (for users) * Save on bandwidth and hosting costs often eliminating costs entirely; * Creating a common place to share and view video content; * Making a user friendly experience, where uploading a video and streaming or embedding video does not require advanced programming knowledge. It is now commonly achieved through a web browser, and can be done by users with no programming experience. Description Online video platforms can use a software as a service (SaaS) business model, a do it yourself (DIY) model or user-generated content (UGC) model. The OVP comes with an end-to-end tool set to upload, encode, manage, playback, style, deliver, distribute, download, publish and measure quality of service or audience engagement quality of experience of online video content for both video on demand and live delivery. This is usually manifested as a User Interface with log-in credentials. OVPs also include providing a custom video player or a third-party video player that can be embedded in a website. Modern online video platforms are often coupled up with embedded online video analytics providing video publishers with detailed insights into video performance: the total number of video views, impressions, and unique views; video watch time, stats on user location, visits, and behavior on the site. Video heat maps show how user engagement rate changes through the viewing process in order to measure audience interaction and to create compelling video content. OVPs are related to the over-the-top content video industry, although there are many OVP providers that are also present in broadcast markets, serving video on demand set-top boxes. OVP product models vary in scale and feature-set, ranging from ready-made web sites that individuals can use, to white label models that can be customized by enterprise clients or media/content aggregators and integrated with their traditional broadcast workflows. The former example is YouTube. The latter example is predominantly found in FTA (Free-To-Air) or pay-TV broadcasters who seek to provide an OTT service that extends the availability of their content on desktops or multiple mobility devices. In general, the graphical user interface accessed by users of the OVP is sold as a service. Revenue is derived from monthly subscriptions based on the number of users it is licensed to and the complexity of the workflow. Some workflows require encryption of content with DRM and this increases the cost of using the service. Videos may be transcoded from their original source format or resolution to a mezzanine format (suitable for management and mass-delivery), either on-site or using cloud computing. The latter would be where platform as a service, is provided as an additional cost. It is feasible, but rare, for large broadcasters to develop their own proprietary OVP. However, this can require complex development and maintenance costs and diverts attention to 'building' as opposed to distributing/curating content. OVPs often cooperate with specialized third-party service providers, using what they call an application programming interface (API). These include cloud transcoders, recommendation engines, search engines, metadata libraries and analytics providers. Video and content delivery protocols The vast majority of OVPs use industry- standard HTTP streaming or HTTP progressive download protocols. With HTTP streaming, the de facto standard is to use adaptive streaming where multiple files of a video are created at different bit rates, but only one of these is sent to the end-user during playback, depending on available bandwidth or device CPU constraints. This can be switched dynamically and near-seamlessly at any time during the video viewing. The main protocols for adaptive HTTP streaming include Smooth Streaming (by Microsoft), HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) (by Apple) and Flash Video (by Adobe). Flash is still in use but is declining due to the popularity of HLS and Smooth Stream in mobile devices and desktops, respectively. Each is a proprietary protocol in its own right and due to this fragmentation, there have been efforts to create one standardized protocol known as MPEG-DASH. There are many OVPs available on the Internet. Influence In the 2010s, with the increasing prevalence of technology and the Internet in everyday life, video hosting services serve as a portal to different forms of entertainment (comedy, shows, games, or music), news, documentaries and educational videos. Content may be either both user- generated, amateur clips or commercial products. The entertainment industry uses this medium to release music and videos, movies and television shows directly to the public. Since many users do not have unlimited web space, either as a paid service, or through an ISP offering, video hosting services are becoming increasingly popular, especially with the explosion in popularity of blogs, internet forums and other interactive pages. The mass market for camera phones and smartphones has increased the supply of user-generated video. Traditional methods of personal video distribution, such as making a DVD to show to friends at home, are unsuited to the low resolution and high volume of camera phone clips. In contrast, current broadband Internet connections are well suited to serving the quality of video shot on mobile phones. Most people do not own web servers, and this has created demand for user-generated video content hosting.Ten video sharing services compared Apr 7 2006 Free video format support Some websites prefer royalty-free video formats such as Theora (with Ogg) and VP8 (with WebM). In particular, the Wikipedia community advocates the Ogg format and some web sites now support searching specifically for WebM videos. Copyright issues On some websites, users share entire films by breaking them up into segments that are about the size of the video length limit imposed by the site (e.g., 15-minutes). An emerging practice is for users to obfuscate the titles of feature-length films that they share by providing a title that is recognizable by humans but will not match on standard search engines. It is not even in all cases obvious to the user if a provided video is a copyright infringement. For privacy reasons, the users' comments are usually ignored by websites of the Internet preservation, like it happens in Web Archive, or in Archive.today copy saving. Mobile video hosting A more recent application of the video hosting services is in the mobile web 2.0 arena, where video and other mobile content can be delivered to, and easily accessed by mobile devices. While some video- hosting services like DaCast and Ustream have developed means by which video can be watched on mobile devices, mobile-oriented web-based frontends for video hosting services that possess equal access and capability to desktop oriented web services have yet to be developed. A mobile live streaming software called Qik allows the users to upload videos from their cell phones to the internet. The videos will then be stored online and can be shared to various social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Videos will be stored on the servers and can be watched from both the mobile devices and the website. History Practical online video hosting and video streaming was made possible by advances in video compression, due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video. Raw uncompressed digital video has a bit rate of 168Mbit/s for SD video, and over 1Gbit/s for full HD video. The most important data compression algorithm that enabled practical video hosting and streaming is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972. The DCT algorithm is the basis for the first practical video coding format, H.261, in 1988. It was followed by more popular DCT-based video coding formats, most notably the MPEG and H.26x video standards from 1991 onwards. The modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) is also the basis for the MP3 audio compression format introduced in 1994, and later the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format in 1999. Video hosting sites The first Internet video hosting site was ShareYourWorld.com. Founded in 1997, it allowed users to upload clips or full videos in different file formats. However, Internet access bandwidth and video transcoding technology at the time were limited, so the site did not support video streaming like YouTube later did. ShareYourWorld was founded by Chase Norlin, and it ran until 2001, when it closed due to budget and bandwidth problems. Founded in October 2004, Pandora TV from South Korea is the first video sharing website in the world to attach advertisement to user-submitted video clips and to provide unlimited storage space for users to upload. It was founded in the Gangnam District of Seoul.\\"Privacy Policy .\\" Pandora TV.

It was based on video transcoding technology, which enabled the video streaming of user-generated content from anywhere on the World Wide Web. This was made possible by implementing a Flash player based on MPEG-4 AVC video with AAC audio. This allowed any video coding format to be uploaded, and then transcoded into Flash-compatible AVC video that can be directly streamed from anywhere on the Web. The first YouTube video clip was Me at the zoo, uploaded by Karim in April 2005. YouTube subsequently became the most popular online video platform, and changed the way videos were hosted on the Web. The success of YouTube led to a number of similar online video streaming platforms, from companies such as Netflix, Hulu and Crunchyroll.

It has been used for four published games and one published preview to date, and the design principles are in the Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide, a book of advice in how to create new games using Cortex Plus, and list of new games produced via Kickstarter.Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide Kickstarter According to the Hacker's Guide there are three basic 'flavors' of Cortex Plus; Action, Drama, and Heroic. Of the four games published using this system, Leverage: The Roleplaying Game was nominated for the 2011 Origins Award for best Role Playing Game,Leverage RPG on RPG Geek and Marvel Heroic Roleplaying won the 2013 award and the award for best support as well as the 2012 ENnie Award for Best Rules and runner up for Best Game.Marvel Heroic Roleplaying on RPG Geek System Unlike the Cortex System, Cortex Plus is a roll and keep system in which you roll one die from each category and keep the two highest dice in your dice pool. What goes into your dice pool is whatever is considered important for the game you are playing - but different stories have different things they consider important so the implementation of the system has been different for each game so far. All versions of Cortex Plus use standard polyhedral dice and the normal dice notation ranging from d4 (a 4 sided tetrahedral die) to d12 (a 12-sided dodecahedral die), and narratively notable features are given dice from this list, with d6 being the default. In all cases Cortex Plus uses dice pools ranging from d4 (terrible) to d12 (the best possible), and every die in your pool that rolls a natural 1 (called an \\"Opportunity\\") doesn't count toward your total and causes some form of negative consequence which, depending on the game, either creates a complication for the characters to overcome or adds to the Doom Pool that provides the Game Master resources within the scene. Adding a d4 to your dice pool is considered a penalty because it isn't likely to roll one of your best two die results and there's such a high chance of rolling a 1. Most versions of Cortex Plus (other than the Smallville Roleplaying Game) give the character a set of three distinctions that they can choose to add to their dice pool either as a d8 to assist them, or as a d4 to hinder them - but they gain a plot point by using the d4 option. Equipment is normally handled by enabling the character to do things (you can't shoot someone without a gun) but where it is especially notable it is given a dice rating and added to the dice pool as an asset. And things that get in the way are treated similarly, and added to the dice pool as complications. Cortex Plus also uses Plot Points - the normal uses of which are to establish something as notable (turning it into an asset), power a stunt or ability, to add a die to your roll, or to keep an additional die after you have rolled. Action Cortex Plus Action is used in both Leverage: The Roleplaying Game and the Firefly Role-Playing Game, and is the most traditional of the three. The important factors are an attribute (Leverage uses the six from the Cortex System, Firefly uses Physical/Mental/Social), and a Skill (the Leverage RPG uses Grifter, Hacker, Hitter, Mastermind, and Thief which are based on the TV show, while the Firefly RPG has a list of 22). Also in the dice pool can be a distinction, an asset, and a complication affecting the opposition. The Leverage RPG, as a heist or con game, allows characters to spend a plot point to establish flashback scenes to explain what is really going on and why things are not as bad as they appear. Drama Cortex Plus Drama is used in the Smallville Roleplaying Game, which was the first Cortex Plus game. It has the most complicated character generation; the players start by drawing a relationship map that step by step ties the player characters to each other and the gameworld. Instead of attributes and skills, the important factors are considered Relationships with other characters and Values (Duty, Glory, Justice, Love, Power, Truth in Smallville) and each relationship and values having a statement attached and you can use the dice when acting in line with the statement. A character can also challenge a value statement and possibly reject it, allowing them to use it three times in the dice pool on that roll - but using a smaller die for the rest of the session every time they want to invoke that value or relationship. When a character loses a contest and doesn't give in Smallville they take stress (Insecure, Afraid, Angry, Exhausted, and Injured) which can be used against them - or they can use at the cost of increasing the amount of stress they've taken, and being unable to act beyond d12 stress. Heroic Cortex Plus Heroic was written for Marvel Heroic Roleplaying and has the largest dice pools. In addition to distinctions, assets, complications, and stress (as used in Drama - with stress being Physical, Mental, and Emotional in Marvel Heroic), Cortex Plus Heroic characters have an Affiliation (Solo, Buddy, Team), at least one powerset and possibly more, and some Specialities (which represent a mix of skills, resources, and contacts). The powersets are further detailed with SFX and Limits so they more closely represent the vision of the character, and character creation is largely freeform. Unlike other Cortex Plus games, the default is to keep three dice with the third die representing the effect size and not being added to the total, only the size of this die mattering. This third die is known as the Effect Die. Marvel Heroic Roleplaying commonly uses large dice pools with seven separate categories (and potentially more than one power set). The dice in Marvel Heroic are: From the character: * Distinction which may be invoked either positively for a d8 or negatively for a d4 (more chance of being a complication, little chance of being one of the best two dice) * Affiliation (Solo/Budy/Team). This reflects who the character is with and the nature of the scene. Each character has one at d6, one at d8, one at d10. * Power Sets - representing the characters' powers. To better represent a character's abilities these are tweaked with Sfx and limits. One die per power set by default - but Sfx can increase this. * Speciality which represents a mix of character skill, knowledge, and connections in their specialty field. Experts are rated d8, and Masters d10. A d10 speciality may be replaced by 2d8 or 3d6 and a d8 speciality may be replaced by 2d6. There are also three potential dice from the situation: * Asset - a situational advantage or an object that's been created earlier. * Resource created in a \\"transition scene\\" a resource represents a character building something with their skill or calling on their contacts in advance. * Their opponent's state - opponents may have taken stress (i.e. harm) or complications (i.e. temporary disadvantages) from previous actions, and one die for this may be included. Extra dice may be included through Plot Points, and characters seldom use all those dice.

Modified Construction Equipment IDF Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer, which is used by the IDF for clearing IEDs/Mines The Israel Defense Forces Combat Engineering Corps uses an armored version of the D9, called IDF Caterpillar D9 \\"Doobi\\", to clear paths and operational terrain from landmines and a various IEDs. The heavy armor and durable construction of the IDF D9 enable it to withstand very heavy \\"belly charges\\" (IEDs weighing more than 100 kg planted underground to hit the hull of an armored fighting vehicle) which are capable of destroying main battle tanks. The IDF also have a remote- controlled version of the D9N, called \\"Raam HaShachar\\" (\\"Dawn Thunder\\" in Hebrew) to clear IEDs in very dangerous environments. The United States Army uses an armored version of the Caterpillar D7 to clear landmines. A remote version of the D7 exists. Electronic countermeasures (jammers, ECM) Duke V3 Counter Radio-controlled Electronic Warfare jamming system Duke Version 3 Vehicle mounted CREW system:, manufactured by SRCTec, Inc., is a counter radio-controlled improvised explosive device (RCIED) electronic warfare (CREW) system that was developed to provide U.S. forces critical, life-saving protection against a wide range of threats. It is a field deployable system that was designed to have minimal size, weight and power requirements while providing simple operation and optimal performance in order to provide force protection against radio-controlled IEDs. CREW Duke V3 consists of a primary unit known as the CREW Duke V2 and a secondary unit that features advanced electronic warfare subsystems to counter emerging advanced RCIED technologies. Advanced EW components and techniques are implemented to combat complex threat infrastructures in order to provide a maximum protection radius while minimizing the overall system cost and prime power consumption requirements. CVRJ CREW Vehicle Receiver Jammer CVRJ (CREW Vehicle Receiver Jammer) U.S. Marines: The primary purpose of the CVRJ system is to defeat existing Radio Frequency (RF) threats and newly identified Hard-to-Kill RF threats. The CVRJ system accomplishes its primary mission by jamming each threat's transmitted RF signals. The secondary purpose of the CVRJ system is to add the capability to combine multiple internal RF signals and external RF inputs from other systems, and serve as the conduit for transmitting those RF signals while maintaining system interoperability. It accomplishes both missions via 15 waveform programmable RF channels. The system is software controlled to meet specific threats. Indicators on the CVRJ front panel and Remote Control Unit (RCU) allow the operator to observe system health and diagnostic messages. Built-In-Test (BIT) routines run during system initialization and operation that notify the operator of system faults by illuminating indicators referred to as \\"annunciators\\" and by displaying text messages on the RCU display. The system is highly automated which reduces operator interaction. The system draws up to 36 amps of vehicle power, weighs approximately 69 lbs, and measures 13″H × 14″W × 19″D. Vehicle Jammer System STAR V: Protective modular jamming system STAR V 740 is intended for a protection against RCIED. The system either prevents the activation of RCIED or it can significantly reduce the distance for a bomb activation. The system is used to protect the special EOD teams or for a convoy protection. The jamming is performed by random frequency sweeping in a few frequencies sub-bands at the same time. Each sub- band has a possibility to set up to two communication windows for mutual radio communication. The jamming system is equipped with 8 wideband transmitters, 3 low-pass filters, 1 combiner, 6 omni-directional antennas and 8 wide-band digital exciters. The higher level of jamming efficiency is accomplished by using more parallel subsystems and digital technology. The jamming system is intended as a mobile system which is installed in the vehicle. It is equipped with the Omni-directional antennas that are part of the system. The output power of the jammer is up to 740 W. The jamming system is easily controlled and the failures are easily diagnosed. It is controlled on the front panel. The operator can switch on/off particular transmitting systems and subsystems, set up to three jamming sub-bands in each. Dwell time in each sub-band can also be modified. Jammer is equipped with IP, RS 485 and USB interface. System is also equipped with special SW which can be installed on a notebook or a PC. Special remote control box is also included. The system's voltage is from 22 to 30 Volts. HP 3260 H convoy jammer system installed in a GMC vehicle. Convoy Jammer System HP 3260 H: Modular jamming system intended to protect surrounding vehicles and personnel against RCIED. Designed for maximum frequency coverage and protection range, the system is used for both, civilian and military motorcades. The modularity enables users to scale the system according to operational requirements and the software allows programming of all signal generators independently to ensure utmost configurability and maximising the effectiveness of the jamming signals. Two soldiers with the 25th Infantry Division operate Thor and Minehound, two counter-IED devices Thor III dismounted CREW system: The Thor III system consists of three dismounted man-pack subsystems, one battery charger, and twenty-four batteries (BB-2590/U). Each subsystem contains a R/T (low band, mid band or high band), a Remote Control Unit (RCU), an integration/pack frame, an Rx/Tx Antenna (low band, mid band, or high band), a GPS antenna, cables, and software. Each subsystem is housed in a separate transit case with protective covers. The purpose of the Thor III dismounted system is to provide the user in the field with a wearable Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) jammer that has been designed to counter an array of frequency diverse threats. The system is an expandable, active and reactive, scanning-receiver-based jammer with multiple jamming signal sources that allow it to counter multiple simultaneous threats. Joint IED Neutralizer (JIN): In 2005, Ionatron attempted to develop an anti IED device that would \\"zap\\" IEDs from a distance by using lasers to ionize the air and allow man-made lightning to shoot towards the devices detonating them at a safe distance. By using femtosecond lasers light pulses that last less than a ten-trillionth of a second JIN could carve conductive channels of ionized oxygen in the air. Through these channels, Ionatron's blaster sent man-made lightning bolts. Thor IED Zappers: The vehicular system is mounted on a remotely controlled weapon station, carrying the laser beam director and high-energy laser and coaxial 12.7 mm machine gun to neutralize improvised explosive devices from a safe, standoff distance. Restricted link Ultra Wide Band High Powered Electro Magnetics: An UWB-HPEM system typically consists of the following components: a battery-based direct current power supply, an actuation system, a semiconductor-based ultra- wideband pulse generator and an ultra-wideband antenna. Depending on the type of threat, it can either set off a sensor-triggered IEDs in a controlled explosion or prevent it from being remotely detonated by radio or mobile phone. A UWB-HPEM system can be loaded onto a vehicle, creating an electromagnetic protection zone for a convoy, potentially in combination with other systems. IED Countermeasure Equipment (ICE): In the fall of 2004, the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and New Mexico State University's Physical Science Laboratory developed a jamming system that uses low-power radio frequency energy to block the radio signals that detonate enemy IEDs. The IED Countermeasure Equipment is typically mounted on a vehicle and is used to neutralize IEDs when avoiding, disarming, or destroying them is not practical. So far, several thousand ICE systems have been deployed to U.S. military personnel.  Other Countermeasures  Ground Ordnance Land Disruptor: G.O.L.D. is a user filled, explosively driven Counter-IED system that renders buried IEDs safe through a combination of disruption, component separation and expulsion from the ground allowing the IED to remain biometrically intact. Rhino: Rhino is a box-shaped heating device attached to a long pole that can be mounted to the front of a vehicle to prematurely detonate any buried IEDs in front of the vehicle. Detection Systems A variety of technologies are used to detect landmines, improvised explosive devices (IED) and unexploded ordnance (UXO), including acoustic sensors, animals and biologically-based detection systems (bees, dogs, pigs, rats), chemical sensors, electromagnetic sensors and hyperspectral sensor analysis, generalized radar techniques, ground penetrating radar, lidar and electro-optical sensors (including hyperspectral and millimeter wave), magnetic signatures, nuclear sensors, optical sensors, seismic acoustic sensors, and thermal detection. Counter-IED Reconnaissance Planes: The U.S. Army's Task Force ODIN-E flies manned reconnaissance aircraft that use an array of full-motion video (FMV), electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery sensors to find IEDs. IED Volumetric Detection: Microwave Based Explosive Caches Detection: Raytheon UK's Soteria vehicle-mounted stand-off system provides high-definition IED detection, confirmation and threat diagnostics from a significant distance. Soteria's optical processing technology has the following capabilities: a high probability of IED detection with a low false positive rate, detection of high, medium, low and zero metal content IEDs, assisted target recognition, and day and night operability. Non-linear Junction Detector (NLJD): A portable NLJD allows the operator to search voids and areas where they are unable to gain physical or visual access, in order to detect electronic components and determine if the area is free from IEDs. Laser IED Detection: Scientists are learning to adapt lasers to detect, or defeat, IEDs. The article details efforts to design a system that will use lasers and radar to detect trace amounts of precursors used in IEDs from a safe stand-off distance. Mine detectors: A portable, hand-held or worn device to detect buried IEDs. There are many different models from several different companies currently in use worldwide by U.S. and coalition forces. These are not your run of the mill metal detectors that you can buy at your local store, they are highly sophisticated, ultra sensitive, programmable devices. The web page details just one of many mine detectors available to locate IEDs. Unmanned Systems intended for Counter-IED Current version of PTDS, a widely used Aerostat in combat operations. Aerostats Aerostats are balloons equipped with stabilized electro optical, infrared, and radar sensors which are manned 24 hours a day. The Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) is the largest and most capable Aerostat ever used in combat. First used in 2004 (Camp Slayer, Iraq). It can sit for months thousands of feet above a base. Known as the \\"unblinking eye\\", Aerostats provide real-time High Definition imagery of the surrounding area, day or night, and are strategically placed for surveillance purposes. They enhance situational awareness and improve force protection. Aerostats can be used to reconnoiter routes before friendly forces travel them and to provide over watch for dismounted troops or convoys. They can also serve as a communications and Full Motion Video (FMV) relay platform to extend the range and disseminate situational awareness. They are linked with several ground-based sensors, including acoustic sensors that detect and locate weapon fire or blasts. File:MASINT-UTAMStower.pngMASINT-UTAMS tower  Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS)  The Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) is a large helium-filled lighter than air system designed by Lockheed Martin to provide soldiers long range intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and communication assistance. Since the Civil War, when Union Soldiers utilized hot air balloons to serve as a surveillance platform, airship technology has been a part of the Army's inventory. As U.S. forces began a troop surge in Afghanistan while maintaining security in Iraq, the need to provide soldiers with a persistent view of the battlefield was critical. In 2003, Lockheed Martin engineers began updating existing naval aerostats with durable materials capable of achieving lift while carrying larger payloads of sensors, cameras and audio equipment. New tethers—lined with a mix of copper wires and fiber-optic cables—transmitted data to a ground control station, which then disseminated near real-time information of hostile activity to operational forces. The aerostats are reconnaissance tool, gathering intelligence from 100 miles in every direction, 24 hours a day, for weeks on end. In Iraq and Afghanistan, there was a special need for enhanced surveillance, especially in the attempt to counter improvised explosive devices. The Army Research Laboratory developed and then mounted PTDS with an acoustic-sensor array, known as the Unattended Transient Acoustic MASINT Sensor (UTAMS). The technology detects, locates, and cues a collocated imager to transient sounds, such as enemy mortar, rocket launches, and IED attacks, and calculates the ground location of the threat source. Adding this airborne detection – localization – cueing capability provides accurate intelligence to PTDS. PTDS is compatible with other technology developed by the Army Research Laboratory, such as Serenity Payload and FireFly. The first PTDS was deployed by the US Army in 2004 and 37 PTDS units were acquired by 2010. Lockheed Martin delivered the final PTDS to the US Army in May 2012, bringing the total number of systems procured by the US Army to 66. The airship has been one of the Army's major weapons since 2004 and was recognized by the Department of Army Engineers and Scientists as the Army's greatest invention in 2005. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) A UGV is a vehicle kit system that advances perception, localization and motion planning to protect from IED threats and increase performance in autonomous missions. They typically are adaptable to any tactical wheeled vehicle for the purpose of supervised autonomous navigation in either a lead or follow role. UGVs are multi-sensor systems which use registration techniques to provide accurate positioning estimates without needing to rely on continuous tracking through a lead vehicle or GPS signals. When equipped with a UGV, each vehicle is capable of navigation to the objective independently.

It is defined as \\"the most inclusive clade containing Europelta but not the North American Cedarpelta, Peloroplites, Sauropelta or Edmontonia\\" while being reinstated for a newly recognized clade of basal nodosaurids. Struthiosaurinae appeared at about exactly the same time as the North American subfamily Nodosaurinae. Struthiosaurines range all across the Cretaceous, the oldest genus being Europelta at an age of 112 Ma and the youngest being Struthiosaurus at about 85–66 Ma. It was originally mentioned by Franz Nopcsa in 1923 as a subfamily of Acanthopholidae, along with the previously defined Acanthopholinae. The family has gone through many taxonomic revisions since it was defined by Nopcsa in 1902. It is now recognized as a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae. The subfamily now includes the genera Anoplosaurus, Europelta, Hungarosaurus, and Struthiosaurus, designated as the type genus. Because of the instability of Acanthopholis, the generic namesake of Acanthopholinae, and its current identification as a nomen dubium, Struthiosaurinae, the next named group, was decidedly used over the older one. A review of ankylosaur osteoderms was published in 2000, and reviewed the armour of Struthiosaurinae. The group was represented by the single genus Struthiosaurus, known from head, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal scutes. Only a few head osteoderms were identified, so it is unknown how much of the skull was armoured. Many cervical and dorsal scutes have been preserved alongside species of Struthiosaurus. They include cervical bands, which are groups of osteoderms fused together and attached to the vertebrae, and large spines found on the shoulders of nodosaurids like Sauropelta and Edmontonia, although it is not known if the spines were fused like the later of separate like the former. It is quite possible that small ovoid scutes found on Struthiosaurus could have formed a pelvic shield like polacanthids. The caudal scutes of struthiosaurines are small and rough. Even though osteoderms are well-known, it is not certain where they were positioned on the body. Classification Struthiosaurinae is a group named by Franz Nopcsa, that was reinstated by James Kirkland for a group of just-european nodosaurids. History Humerus of Struthiosaurus Baron Franz Nopcsa, in 1902, proposed a new grouping of dinosaurs, Acanthopholididae, a clade of lightly-built thyreophorans. He included in it the genera Acanthopholis, Polacanthus, Syngonosaurus, Struthiosaurus, and possibly Nodosaurus. Soon after, he also added Priodontognathus and Palaeoscincus. He considered Acanthopholididae to be the sister clade to Stegosauridae, and also stated that it might include Hylaeosaurus, which he found had most of the characteristics of the family. Later, in 1915, he rearranged the species included in it. The genera that were later included were Acanthopholis (=Anoplosaurus), Polacanthus, Stegopelta, Stegoceras, and Struthiosaurus. Along with Ankylosaurus, Acanthopholididae was defined to form a subfamily of Nodosauridae. In 1923 he divided up the family into two subfamilies without comment. These two subfamilies were named Acanthopholinae and Struthiosaurinae. In the same year, he corrected the subgroups of Thyreophora. He placed Acanthopholididae, Stegosauridae and Ceratopsidae together inside the group. Five years later, he corrected the name of the family to Acanthopholidae, which is now the correct spelling. In the same publication, he also changed the genera included. He assigned Hylaeosaurus, Stegoceras, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon inside it but moved Stegopelta and Ankylosaurus into the family Ankylosauridae. Nopcsa then downgraded the phylogenetic rank of Acanthopholidae to make it a subfamily inside Nodosauridae. The clade was defined to include Ankylosaurus and Acanthopholinae. Inside Acanthopholinae he placed Acanthopholis, Hylaeosaurus, Rhodanosaurus, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon. Now considered as an artificial grouping, it was defined to include dinosaur taxa now considered to be polacanthids, a pachycephalosaur and Acanthopholis, a genus that is widely considered to be dubious. Acanthopholidae and Acanthopholinae are now dubious groups since the validity of Acanthopholis has changed. Phylogeny Historically, Struthiosaurinae has been considered a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae by Walter P. Coombs in 1978 and Tatyana Tumanova in 1987, or a sister clade to Edmontoniinae, Panoplosaurinae, Stegopeltinae, and Sauropeltinae by Tracy L. Ford in 2000. Kirkland and his colleagues followed Ford in using Struthiosaurinae as a clade of basal nodosaurids, but concluded that the only other subfamily of Nodosauridae was Nodosaurinae. According to Kirkland et al., Acanthopholinae was not an acceptable classification for the new clade of previously unrecognized nodosaurids because of the instability of Acanthopholis. Struthiosaurinae was decided on as the name of the clade, as it was the next published term after Acanthopholinae. To ensure the group was rendered valid, Kirkland et al. redefined Struthiosaurinae as the most inclusive clade containing Europelta but not Cedarpelta, Peloroplites, Sauropelta, or Edmontonia. This definition includes the genera Anoplosaurus, Europelta, Hungarosaurus and Struthiosaurus inside the newly defined group. Below is a cladogram from before the recognition of the clade Struthiosaurinae. Jaw of Hungarosaurus Description Size comparison of Europelta and a human. Struthiosaurines are well-known, and include one of the best-preserved species of ankylosaur, Europelta carbonensis. Osteoderms Struthiosaurus osteoderms In 2000, Ford published a complete description of ankylosaurian osteoderms, in which he recognized the group Struthiosaurinae. Ford's description of Struthiosaurinae was based on the genus Struthiosaurus. Ford found that Struthiosaurus transylvanicus lacked any remains of the jugal, which makes a jugal scute unknown. The skull roof of T. transylvanicus is large and bulbous, preserving a large, flat scute on top, and no osteoderms behind the orbits. Another species, S. austriacus, is known from two incomplete skulls, which preserved irregular scutes parallel to the orbits along the cranium. Scutes from the postcranial region of the skeleton are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups of two or three osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side-to-side and was as long as the whole band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly arching shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat tops and rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine in the middle of the back. That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up and down, like in polacanthids, and the medial scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of medial scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape. Skeletal reconstruction of Europelta, the most complete ankylosaurian known from Europe: B and C showing osteoderm coverage Thoratic scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to teardrop shaped, and possess sharp ridges that rise distally. Some scutes were long and had small domes on them. The first primary osteoderms on the pelvis are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short point. S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the pelvis. One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was from the edge of the pelvic region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them. Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes. Caudal scutes have been preserved on struthiosaurines. The osteoderms are compressed inwards from the side, have a slope positioned anteriorly, and a square-shaped posterior edge. Distinguishing anatomical features All ankylosaurs that possess these characteristics - a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal quadrate that is not fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; the presence of mandibular condyles that are three times wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a symphysis with the front of the lower jaw (the predentary); a sacrum arched on top; an acromion process above the midpoint of the scapula to coracoid attachment; a straight ischium with a straight dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms with flat bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids, the Struthiosaurinae. That set of cranial and postcranial features are only present on genera considered to be in the clade. The features above distinguish Struthiosaurinae from other clades and genera found by other analysis'. Biogeography Biogeography of European and North American nodosaurids and polacanthids The near simultaneous appearance of nodosaurids in both North America and Europe is worthy of consideration, because at the time, they were separated from each other by a huge body of water. Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe; it is derived from the lower Albian Escucha Formation. The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta, from the lower Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, at an age of 108.5±0.2 million years. Eastern North American fossils seem older. Teeth of Priconodon crassus have been derived from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland, which dates near the Aptian–Albian boundary. A Propanoplosaurus hatchling was uncovered from the base of the underlying Patuxent Formation, dated to the upper Aptian, making Propanoplosaurus the oldest nodosaurid. Polacanthids are known from pre-Aptian fauna from both Europe and North America. The timing of the appearance of nodosaurids on both continents indicates the origins of the clade preceded the isolation of North America and Europe, thereby pushing the group's date of evolution back to at least the middle Aptian. The separation of Nodosauridae into European Struthiosaurinae and North American Nodosaurinae by the end of the Aptian provides a revised date for the isolation of the continents from each other with rising sealevel. Struthiosaurinae is one of the longest- lasting groups of ankylosaurians. They range from Europelta at 112 Ma to Struthiosaurus, which lived until the uppermost Cretaceous, or 66 Ma. In between those two early and late struthiosaurines are the genera Anoplosaurus and Hungarosaurus. Hungarosaurus is younger, at about 85 Ma, from the late Santonian of the Csehbánya Formation. Anoplosaurus is a fair amount older, at about 100 Ma, from the late Albian Cambridge Greensand.

The compiled-season version of the show is produced by Wayland Productions, and is distributed through CD/Digital downloads by Blackstone Audio and also through the Nerdist Podcast Network.  Background  We're Alive started early in 2009 when creator, Kc Wayland, originally outlined the story for a pitch for television. At the time he saw there was a gap in programming that could be filled by a horror survival series. He designed a show that would take advantage of the repeated set, the tower, and then branch out from there as the show would get more popular. After the initial story and character outlines were created, he then proceeded to talk with other film producers seeing if there would be a way to get the show on broadcast television. After not being able to successfully pitch the idea, Wayland then decided to produce the show as an audio drama. The concept for self-production was a \\"if you build it, they will come\\"; in regards to both listeners and producers. In late April 2009, Wayland met with Shane Salk and pitched the idea. Together they settled on the serialized audio format. Wayland and Salk went on to produce the first two seasons, and then Grayson Stone (an intern in season 1 and 2) and Wayland continued to produce the final two seasons. In 2015, Wayland announced a follow-up podcast mini-series titled We're Alive: Lockdown. The project was crowdfunded through Kickstarter, raising $54,774 of its $50,000 goal. In 2019, Wayland released a new follow-up chapter to the series titled We're Alive: Goldrush.  Format  There were several factors that led Wayland to the audio-only format. In limiting the visuals, the story would be able to explore limitless possibilities in settings and situations not fully explored by this genre. Being a \\"horror\\", the power of sound and \\"what you can't see\\" could be utilized in a powerful way. Using no visuals also limited the vastness of production. Actors could come in once every two months for a full day of recording that would cover six full episodes (2 chapters).  Production process  A typical chapter is about sixty pages long, and is recorded by the actors in a recording stage in Orange County, CA. A typical day runs about six to eight hours of raw recording. From there, a voice cutter then goes through the session and separates just the usable lines, and then passes it onto another editor who then lays in the initial sound effects and pacing. The last stage then goes back to Wayland, who acts as the supervising sound editor and covers the last stage of production, often doing a large amount of foley and music selections.  Release dates and episode length  In a typical month, We're Alive produced three episodes comprising one chapter, taking one week off between chapters. Twelve chapters make up one season, and there are four seasons with a total of forty eight chapters. Each episode is approximately twenty minutes, making each chapter about an hour long.  Published version  Blackstone Audio has published all three seasons currently available: Season 1, Season 2, Season 3.  Awards  We're Alive was nominated in 2012 for the Best Audio Drama in the Audio Publishing Awards. In the same year, it was named \\"Best of 2012\\" in the iTunes Arts category.

The Surnames of the Caṅkam Age: Literary & Tribal, published in 1968 sought to offer one of the earliest treatments in this area. Background The Cankam literature is thematically divided into akam and puram. The poets worked under a convention of anonymity, not exposing the names of the heroes, heroines and friends in their poems, particularly in the former, in order to underline the universality of the feelings expressed in their poetry. Tolkappiyam classifications The Tolkāppiyam identifies ten categories of names. An̲n̲i Mirutalakumāri Tāmacu claims to have completely revealed the basis on which the Tamils adopted their names. Wilden classifications Eva Wildern identifies four types of names found in the Sangam literature: proper names, proper names connected with a name of a place or a dynasty, proper names with epithets and imagery names. This convention was codified in the Tolkāppiyam. Tantaipeyar This tradition involves firstly having the father's name followed by one's own name. This system was carried even into the medieval period. Examples include cēramān, meaning \\"son of Chera\\" composed of cēra and makan, or vēlmān, meaning \\"son of Vel\\" composed of vēl and makan. Fives parts of a name The convention is remains that dynastic name is followed by the proper name. However, in the case of distinguished persons, there may be up to five parts to it. Parimelazhagar (c. 13th century) codified the Classical-era conventions in his explanation of the correct name of Yanaikatchai Mantaran Cheral Irumporai as Kōccēramān Yāṇaikkaṭcēi Māntarañcēral Irumpoṛai. Kō meaning 'king' signifying his official title; Cēramān is the dynastic name; Yāṇaikkat 'Elephant-eyed' is a distinctive feature; Cēi is the iyatpeyar, or proper name; and Irumporai is an appellate. Another example is Malayamān Cōzhiya Ēnati Tirukkaṇṇan. Malayamān is the dynastic name; Cōzhiya, \\"of the Chola Nadu; 'Ēnati\\" is the title of conferred by the King to the chief of the army in a ceremony known as Ēnatippatiyam; and Tirukkaṇṇan is his iyatpeyar, or proper name. Dynastic name Poets spoke to kings about the need for children for carrying on the family or dynastic name. The dynastic or family name acts as a prefix and occurs before the actual name. Titles Some titles such as 'Kō' meaning 'king' were acquired, while others were conferred by the King. Three titles particularly renowned were known as Etti, Enati and Kaviti. Talaikkoli, Peraiyan and Marayan are a few of the other titles bestowed to eminent personalities in consideration to their talents in particular fields.

Not only are cowpeas highly nutritious for humans, but they are also a source of fodder for animals, and are regularly used by rural women to generate their own income, thus providing an important source of liquidity for farmers. History In 1987, Professor Larry Murdock of Purdue University, in partnership with Bean/Cowpea CRSP, USAID, and BIFAD, led a team of researchers working to combat bruchid infestations of cowpea harvests in Cameroon. The outcome of this initiative were PICS bags.Baributsa, D., I. Baoua, J. Lowenberg-DeBoer, T. Abdoulaye, and L. L. Murdock Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS) Technology. Rep. 262nd ed. Vol. E.

Since 2007, more than 1.75 million PICS bags have been sold in West and Central Africa and demonstrations of their effectiveness have been conducted in 31,000 villages. Currently, this project is funded with $11.4 million (USD) by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\\"Project Overview.\\" Purdue Improved Crop Storage. Purdue University, 2010. Web. 18 Nov. 2013. Project objectives The PICS project has evolved since its original conception. As such, the project's target objectives have also evolved to meet the needs of its mission of delivering safe, cheap, and effective postharvest storage solutions to smallholder farmers. PICS 1 The specific objectives of this project involve determining the optimal design for a triple-layer, hermetically sealed, commercially available cowpea storage bag. Another goal is to increase the knowledge of farmers and rural-development groups on non- chemical cowpea storage methods, and to demonstrate the most effective cowpea storage methods for these groups. It is also important to the project to develop a local supply chain for PICS bags that makes the technology available to rural farmers, as well as providing development opportunities for local businesses. PICS 2 The second phase sought to expand the original scope of the PICS program. In this second phase, called PICS 2, the program sought to 1) identify agricultural commodities or other food products that suffer losses to insects during storage, 2) test the PICS bags through collaborative projects with scientists in developing nations, primarily sub-Saharan Africa, 3) Implement economic analyses to estimate the potential benefits if the PICS technology were optimized and adopted for a specific commodity, 4) Develop plans to disseminate the technologies for those commodities and communities where it would be most effective and provide the greatest benefit. This phase of the program ran from January 1, 2014 until Jun 30, 2014. PICS 3 The third phase of the program began in April 2014 and is currently ongoing. PICS 3 seeks to improve market access, cash incomes, and food security among smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa by reducing post-harvest storage losses through expansion of the PICS bag technology. Geography Countries where PICS activities have taken place. Yellow represents target countries during the PICS 1 period. Blue represents countries during the PICS 2 period. Orange represents countries where other PICS activities occurred. This project was first developed in Cameroon, but it has since spread to twenty-three nations in Africa and Asia. To date, PICS bags have been introduced and are in use in the following nations: Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia. Use After harvesting and thoroughly drying the grain, farmers place grain into a polyethylene bag capable of holding either 50 kg or 100 kg. The bag is then tightly sealed, preventing air from entering. The first polyethylene bag is surrounded by a second identical bag, which is also sealed, making it airtight. The double-bagged grain is then sealed inside a third woven polypropylene bag, which provides the mechanical strength for PICS bags. This method of triple bagging creates an airtight environment, and seals any insects present in the crop inside the bag. These insects briefly continue to consume oxygen, but as oxygen levels in the bags drop, and CO2 concentrations rise, the insects stop feeding and quickly die, thereby protecting the crop from further damage. Recent studies have shown that bruchids sealed in PICS bags do not die from asphyxiation, but rather from thirst. This subfamily of Chrysomelidae has the ability to produce water through their own metabolism. This process requires oxygen, so when oxygen levels in PICS bags decrease the bruchids lose the ability to produce water and die of dehydration. It is reasonable to assume that this same adaptation exists in other postharvest insects. Advantages PICS bags provide many benefits to smallholder farmers. Not only is this an effective insecticide- free, low-cost method of storing cowpeas and other grain, but it is easy to explain to farmers, and PICS bags can be stored in family homes– making this an effective way for smallholder farmers to protect their harvests. In addition, the bags can be opened at any time – when they are unsealed the cowpeas are ready to be consumed. The PICS bags can then be reused, provided they are free of holes and tears.Baributsa, D., I. Baoua, J. Lowenberg-DeBoer, T. Abdoulaye, and L. L. Murdock. Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS) Technology. Rep. 262nd ed. Vol. E. West Lafayette: Purdue University, 2013. Department of Entomology. Oct. 2013. Web. 19 Nov. 2013. Studies have demonstrated that PICS can be used multiple times across several years without any loss in quality.Baoua, I. B., V. Margam, L. Amadou, and L. L. Murdock. \\"Performance of Triple Bagging Hermetic Technology for Postharvest Storage of Cowpea Grain in Niger.\\" Journal of Stored Products Research 51 (2012): 81-85. . 31 July 2012. Web. 19 Nov. 2013. Storing grain until it reaches a high market value allows farmers to gain greater profits, and storage provides communities with food reserves during the post-harvest season. Even after several months of storage in PICS bags, the quality of the grain does not decline. Economic development The PICS project aims to increase the incomes of smallholder producers. Each household that adopts the use of PICS bags is expected to save $150 (USD) annually. With widespread adoption of PICS bags, global savings of cowpea harvests are predicted to be worth half a billion US dollars annually. The additional income provided through the use of PICS bags will allow smallholder producers to invest in their own farming practices and local communities, thereby encouraging local development. Disadvantages Some problems with this technology are that PICS bags are prone to theft, and therefore need to be protected. In areas where grain has always been sold immediately after harvest, storage areas may not exist for PICS bags. Therefore, the bags' introduction to some communities may also require the construction of new storage facilities. In addition, it is essential that grain intended to be stored in PICS bags be thoroughly dried prior to storage in order to prevent mould growth and grain rot.Baributsa, D., I. Baoua, and L. Murdock. Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) Bag: Size Matters! Rep. no. E-263-W. Purdue University Extension, Oct. 2013. Web. 4 Dec. 2013. And while PICS bags protect cowpeas against damage caused by insects, they do not provide a barrier against mice, rats, or other animals. Finally, the environmental impact of PICS bags remains largely unstudied, and should be seriously considered. Practical information In order to increase the effectiveness of PICS bag technology, the following suggestions should be considered: As studies show, PICS bags work not only by depriving bruchids of oxygen, but also by dehydrating their environment. Therefore, this technology could be improved by finding additional methods of quickly lowering the moisture content within sealed bags. Since PICS bags do not provide protection from mice, rats, or other animals, any NGO aiming to increase their use should ensure that farmers are taught to keep their stored cowpea harvest in an environment free of these exterior threats. There is potential for PICS bags to be improved through the use of an additional barrier that cannot be punctured by animals. Due to low levels of local literacy, this project aims to communicate PICS bag technology to communities through verbal demonstrations and also through information communicated via radio. In order to ensure full community participation in effective cowpea storage, women, men, and children must all participate in PICS bag demonstrations. Solutions competing with PICS bags to prevent insect-induced post-harvest grain losses are other forms of hermetically sealed containers, such as the GrainPro bag. A similar method of protecting the crop is to store grain inside sealed steel drums. Furthermore, the same basic principles of disabling insects within hermetically stored containers could potentially be applied to other crops in the region. References *Baoua, I. B., V. Margam, L.

Emmons' photography depicts scenes of domestic life and New England rural landscape. Born December 30, 1858 in the mill town of Kingfield, Maine, the young Chansonetta Stanley grew interested in photography after her brothers' (Francis E. and Freelan O. Stanley) dry-plate printing invention. (The brothers also invented a steam-powered automobile known as the Stanley Steamer). On February 2, 1887, she married James Nathaniel Whitman Emmons. Her brother Freelan O. Stanley bought her a large house at 22 Harley Street in Ashmont Hill, Dorchester, Massachusetts. in 1895. Chansonetta gave birth in 1891 to a daughter, Dorothy Stanley Emmons, and there exist photographs of the Emmons home and family scenes in Dorchester from the 1890s. After her husband James died in 1898 of blood poisoning at the age of 41, Chansonetta and Dorothy were forced to leave Dorchester and move to Newton, Massachusetts. Chansonetta viewed photography as a way to supplement her income after her husband's death, participating in photographic competitions, camera club exhibitions and lectures which featured her photography reproduced as hand-colored glass lantern slides. Her wealthy brothers also gave financial support throughout her life. Chansonetta is unique in that relatively few photographers, especially women, in the beginning of the 20th century were focused on the \\"domestic vernacular\\" especially in rural northern New England. Chansonetta died at age 79 in 1937. Content is mainly from the Dorchester Atheneum website. The Stanley Museum in Kingfield, Maine owns the largest collection of Chansonetta Stanley Emmons photographic prints and glass plate negatives in the world including her brilliantly hand-colored glass lantern slides. Her earliest photographs consists of images of her family house in Dorchester. In August 2016 the Maine Historical Society accepted the Chansonetta Stanley Emmons Collection on deposit from the Stanley Museum (Kingfield, Maine). The collection is being housed for five years during which the Society is providing year round public access to, and interpretation of, the collection via its Brown Library, Maine Memory Network, and Vintage Maine Images. While not a typical arrangement for the Society, it is providing an opportunity to expand the viability and audience of the collection which includes over 1,500 images of Maine farm and family life from the early 20th century through the 1930s as well to foster scholarship in the photographic medium invented by Chansonsetta Stanley's brothers, a process later sold to Kodak.The Insider's Scoop donor newsletter of the Maine Historical Society, September 2016  References  External links * Peladeau, Marius B.

The transit system consists of 6 phases and the construction of the first phase began in April 2012 by the Austrian construction company Strabag International GmbH. Construction of the first phase was completed in December 2015 at a total cost of €134 million funded by the African Development Bank, World Bank and the Government of Tanzania. The first phase of the project has a total length of 21.1 kilometers with dedicated bus lanes on three trunk routes with a total of 29 stations. The entire system is operated by The Usafiri salama Dar es Salaam Rapid Transit (UDA-RT) under the surveillance of the Surface and Marine Transport regulatory authority (Sumatra)http://www.sumatra.go.tz/ Currently, the route is serviced by a fleet of 140 Chinese built Golden Dragon buses, providing express and local service for 18 hours daily from 05:00am to 11:00pm.  History  An aerial view of the traffic congestion in Dar es Salaam along Azikiwe avenue before the bus transit system was implemented to provide efficient commuting. With the rapidly growing population of the city, the government began to draw plans for a rapid transit system in 2003. The government predicted the city population to grow over 5 million by 2015 and invited the Japan International Cooperation Agency to design a master plan for transport in the city in June 2008. A bus rapid transit and a metro transit system were proposed but the metro system was not approved due to the high construction and operational cost involved. The project was placed under the Prime Minister's office and a Dar Rapid Transit Agency (DART) was created through a government notice on 25 May 2007. A 130 km bus rapid transit was planned to cover over 90% of the city's population and the project was split into six phases due to the large investment required. The initial project cost was financed by the world bank and the bank provided $180 million for the construction of the first phase.  Phases   Phase I  Phase I of the BRT system runs for 21 km from Kimara to Ubungo ending at Kivukoni/Morocco. Construction of the first phase began in April 2012 and was completed in December 2015 by Strabag international GmbH. The route is designed to carry 300,000 commuters daily along 29 stations. The route consists of 21 km of trunk road, 57.9 km of feeder roads, 5 large terminals and 29 stations. The route was placed under interim operations on 24 April 2015 and was fully operational on 10 May 2016, after the fares were decided. =Interim Operations= On 24 April 2015 the Dar Rapid Transit Agency (DART) signed a contract with UDA-RT for the provision of Interim services of the Dar es salaam Rapid Transit system. UDA-RT is a special purpose company formed by UDA and the two Daladala Associations, the Dar es Salaam Commuter Bus Owners Association (DARCOBOA) and UWADAR for the provision of interim services. The interim service was conducted to provide training to future operators and build up local capacity. During interim operations the private dala-dalas were still operational on these routes.  Phase II  Funds for the Second phase were secured in October 2015. The second phase is to run for approximately 19 km from Kilwa to Kawawa south via Kivukoni and is to cost around $160 million. The African Development Bank agreed to fund $141 million for the project, while the remaining funds will come from the government. Construction for the project is due to begin in June 2019 and will take approximately 36 months to complete. Construction of the road will include two flyovers as well. The 20.3km DART project will commence at Gerezani & City Council BRT station. Which will include Kilwa Road, Chang’ombe Road, Kawawa Road, Gerezani Street, Sokoine Drive and Bandari Road. It will be ready by Dec 2020.  Phase III  Funding for the 3rd phase was provided by the International Development Association (IDA). The construction will take place from Gongo La Mboto to City Center, including part of Uhuru Road from Tazara all the way to Kariakoo- Gerezani. construction is set to begin in 2021. Infrastructure Stations There are three types of stations along the route depending on its location and utility: * Terminals: Terminals are located along the start and end stations for all trunk roads. The Terminals allow transfers between feeder services as well as providing access to various transportation services such as regional buses and private vehicles. Terminals also contain parking lots to allow commuters to leave their cars during the day. * Trunk Stations: These are the main stations along the trunk routes. They are accessed via pedestrian crossings and the stations are elevated to provide pedestrians safety. There are four types of trunk stations spaced 500 meters apart along the road (A,B,C and D) depending on the passenger demand. Mwendokasi when turning (2020) * Feeder Stations: Feeder stations allow passengers to transfer from feeder routes onto trunk stations.  Buses  The BRT system operates a fleet of 140 Golden Dragon buses. There are two types of buses operated along the routes, one which is 18 meters long with a carrying capacity of 150 passengers and the other which is 12 meters long with a carrying capacity of 80 passengers.  Routes and Stations  There are six planned phases that will serve over 90% of the city's population and currently only Phase I is operational.

The firm does business in 130 countries, has nearly 13,000 employees, and has more than 100,000 customers. Axalta traces its origins to the German firm Herberts Gmbh, which began in 1866 coating carriages before moving to automotive painting. Through later mergers the company became DuPont Performance Coatings (DPC), part of the American DuPont chemical empire, and was rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems after being purchased by The Carlyle Group in 2013. Axalta went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November 2014 and since then has become fully independent. Carlyle Group exited their last ownership stake in Axalta in 2015. The company was the sponsor of four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon and the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports car, a relationship which dated back to Gordon's first NASCAR Cup Series race in 1992, and today is an executive assistant (Global Business Advisor, reports to CEO Charles Shaver). Axalta currently sponsors Alex Bowman in the No. 88 car and William Byron in the No. 24 car. History The firm's first products were developed in Germany in 1866 to protect carriages from the gravel of dirt roads. In 1920, the company created a quick-drying, multi-color lacquer line for automotive painting. Operating as Herberts Gmbh, the company grew under Kurt Herberts, introducing the popular automobile finish Standox in 1955. In 1999 Herberts merged with DuPont Automotive Finishes, a transport coating systems technology company that had been started in 1922 in Wilmington, Delaware, to form DPC. In 2012, the private equity firm The Carlyle Group announced its plans to purchase and discontinue DPC. The Carlyle Group completed the sale in February 2013 and founded Axalta. On November 12, 2014, the firm completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: AXTA). On January 21, 2015, Axalta and Chinese industrial coatings firm Shanghai Kinlita Chemical formed a partnership to operate in China. In April 2015, Berkshire Hathaway invested $560 million in Axalta Coating Systems. In July 2016, the firm acquired United Paint and Chemical Corp.'s automotive interior coatings business. The company currently operates in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The activities for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region (EMEA) are based in Basel, Switzerland. On November 7, 2018, the company held its grand opening of a new research and development center located at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard known as the Global Innovation Center. Axalta's Global Innovation Center is the largest coatings research and development (R&D;) center in the world. In 1953 Axalta predecessor DuPont published the first annual Color Popularity Report, the first in the industry to have extensive global data in one report. The firm developed L,a,b color equations, an important component of modern color science. It introduced the first waterborne electrical steel coating in the industry in the 1960s. In October 2017, AkzoNobel approached competitor Axalta Coating Systems over a potential combination. Nippon Paint Holdings Co. attempted to buy the company in November 2017, but the deal failed to reach an agreement. Products Among Axalta's oldest products are Standox and Spies Hecker. Cromax, a water- based product, and the industrial paints Nap-Gard, a powder coating for oil and gas pipeline companies, and Voltatex for electrical insulation, were introduced in the 1990s. Other products made by Axalta include Abcite, Alesta, AquaEC, Audurra, Centari, Challenger, Harmonized Coating Technologies, Imron, and Nason. Motorsports William Byron's Axalta-sponsored car at Richmond Raceway in 2018 Axalta currently sponsors the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 of NASCAR Cup Series driver Alex Bowman and the No. 24 Camaro of William Byron. Previously, the company sponsored four-time series champion Jeff Gordon's No. 24 car, a relationship which dated back to Axalta's days as DuPont and Gordon's first Cup race in 1992. As of the 2016 Brickyard 400, Gordon has won three times in an Axalta-sponsored car, all of which were in 2014. During Gordon's career, he ran variations of his Axalta scheme to promote its brands such as Cromax and Standox. On February 12, 2015, Gordon was hired by Axalta as a global business advisor. During the year, Axalta sponsored Regan Smith's JR Motorsports Camaro for the Axalta Faster. Tougher.

It is located in the village of Askvoll. It is one of several churches for the Askvoll parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1863 using designs by Anders Askevold. The church seats about 425 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1306, but the church was not new at that time. The first church was a stave church. The next church was built in 1604 and it was a wooden church that was in use until 1859 when it was torn down. The third church was built in 1860 and it was a cruciform church which was struck by lightning and burned down a mere three years after it was built. The fourth (and present) church was built in 1863 and it was consecrated on 13 December 1863 by the local dean Johan Carl Christie. Steeple The present church was built in 1863 and public opinion about its look was not particularly positive. In his \\"Remembrance protocol\\" the pastor, Bernt Askevold, put it like this: \\"The new church was built with a simple steeple which rose only a few feet above the roof ridge and with a big wooden cross at the other end of the ridge. But people have never liked the simple shape of the church steeple.\\" The main objection of the critics, then, was that the wooden cross was meant to serve as a steeple on the church, and, after some 30 years, in 1896, it was replaced by a \\"proper\\" steeple. This new steeple was much higher and pointed, and people thought this gave the whole building a somewhat prouder character. The artist Anders Askevold from Askvoll had designed the church with the steeple that people objected so much to. The new steeple was erected based on the design by the master builder P. Gabrielsen, but Askevold was asked for advice beforehand. The latter then made some suggestions what should be done. They used Dale Church in neighboring Fjaler municipality as a model for the new steeple. This new steeple eventually put an end to the complaints concerning the look of the church building.

It is located in the village of Holmedal, on the northern shore of the Dalsfjorden. It is one of several churches for the Askvoll parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1868 using designs by the architect Christian Christie. The church seats about 400 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1305. THe first known church was a stave church that was likely built during the 13th century. The medieval church was torn down and a new, timber-framed church was built on the same site around the year 1600. After more than 150 years of use, the church was torn down and replaced with a new building on the same site in 1868. This new church was consecrated on 24 November 1868 by bishop Peter Hersleb Graah Birkeland. Holmedal is an ancient church site, which in former times was the parish centre for a relatively large area. It was not without reason that in 1838 when municipalities were created in Norway, the two municipalities in this area were named Indre Holmedal and Ytre Holmedal. This church was the main church for the old Holmedal parish, which once covered the length of the Dalsfjorden and further up the river Gaula to the Gaularfjellet mountains. Over time, the old parish was split up into two parishes and then in 1990, this part of Fjaler municipality was transferred to Askvoll municipality. The church is now one of the churches in the Askvoll parish. Building The nave is about long and wide, including the side aisles with a total width of . Furthest to the east, the chancel is rounded off with an apse-inspired three- sided wall encircling the beautiful altarpiece from the 17th century and the altar table. The octagonal altar rail complements the architectural lines in this part of the church. On the eastern wall above the altarpiece there is a square window put on edge showing a dove motif in coloured glass. In the central nave there are five big windows in the upper part of the walls, but none on the walls in the side aisles. All the windows are divided into five sections with a clover-leaf pattern on top. This clover-leaf form is repeated in many places in the interior, for example as a decorative element on the organ, and carvings in the partition corners between the main and side aisles.

Work LTI Korea summarizes Lee's work: :The majority of Lee Seongbu’s works, especially those pieces written in the 1960s and 1970s, were born out of the poet’s passionate and furious desire to let the voice of the repressed be heard. Thus, the anger reflected in his poems originated from the external world, or contemporary society, rather than from his inner psyche or from nature. These works aimed to express the lives of the people ignored and tortured throughout history. The images of \\"darkness\\" and \\"night\\" that frequently appear in his poems, for example, convey acceptance of defeat and repression yet also the willingness to overcome such a reality and its limitations. As seen in \\"All Night Long\\", however, the image of \\"night\\" is not always negatively portrayed. When love and understanding for the repressed expands, the image of \\"night\\" transforms into a time and place for celebration.Source-attribution\\"Lee SungBoo\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# : :The poet also believed that genuine anger towards the reality of repression derived from the experience and perseverance of suffering and adversity inherent in life. Thus through such perseverance, compassion and love for those who have repressed and ignored throughout history is bound to grow. The poet also believed that bearing what life has to offer is the true way to surmount sadness and defeat. Accordingly, his poerms are noted for his apt diction and style, which tell of the reality of the external world, in order to bring to light the happenings of the inner world.

The charter was issued months following the surrender of Japan on September 2nd, 1945, which brought World War II to an end. Modeled after the Nuremberg Charter, the Tokyo Charter stipulated that crimes of the Japanese could be tried. Three categories of crimes were defined: crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Article 6 of the Tokyo Charter also stated that holding an official position or acting pursuant to order of his government or of a superior was no defense to war crimes, but that such circumstances may be considered in mitigation of punishment if the Tribunal determines that justice so requires. Like the Nuremberg Trials, the criminal procedure used by the Tokyo Trials was closer to civil law than to common law, with a trial before a panel of judges rather than a jury trial and with wide allowance for hearsay evidence. Defendants who were found guilty could appeal the verdict to the Allied Council for Japan. In addition, they would be permitted to present evidence in their defense and to cross-examine witnesses. Unlike the Nuremberg Charter, the Tokyo Charter was not part of a treaty or agreement among the Allies but it was substantially the same as the Nuremberg Charter. A major exception was that Emperor Hirohito was excluded from being tried for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The Tokyo Charter differs from the Nuremberg Charter, however, in two ways. The Tokyo Charter adds the categories of persons to be held responsible and it does not make \\"persecution\\" subject to \\"religious\\" grounds. The first variance is only in the drafting of Article 5(c) of the Tokyo Charter defining crimes against humanity since the same responsibility basis exists in the Charter thought not in Article 6(c) of the Nuremberg Charter. The second variance is because the Nazi crimes against the Jews did not have a counterpart in the Asian conflict. The Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters were applicable only to major criminals, leaving other criminals to be tried by the Allies. In Germany, the Allies acted pursuant to Control Council Law No. 10 (CCL 10)Nuremberg Trials Final Report Appendix D: Control Council Law No. 10 in their respective zones of occupation. But they also relied on their military and national tribunals, where they applied their own laws. There was no counterpart in Japan to CCL 10 because the United States was the sole occupying power of Japan, whereas Germany was occupied by the four major Allies (United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union). The same legal issues pertaining to Article 6(c) of the Nuremberg Charter also apply to Article 5(c) of the Tokyo Charter.

William Valentine, the founding father of Central Philippine University, founded it. The Hoe underwent a “level-up” in 1916 as it was named “The Jaro Echo” with Mr. Ernesto Gumban and Mr. Benigno Hiñolan as Editors-in-Chief. From that moment, the publication used six (6) legal-sized papers to document important events which transpired and shaped the university’s past. For the record, the staff reproduced only 200 copies to serve the school’s growing population of 150 boys, all were working students. Later, it evolved into a tabloid in the 1920s.LOUDER: The Central Echo Then and Now . Retrieved 12-05-13. In 1921, the first commencement exercises was held with 17 graduates, thus the school yearbook was founded – “The Classbook” now known as “The Centralite”.

The university was totally devastated as Japanese bombed the school leaving only the ruins of the Anna V. Johnson Memorial Hall among all the other structures inside the campus. The Director for Academic Programs, Mr. Alfredo Catedral initiated the revival of the student publication as Central Philippine College re-opened in 1945 shortly after Iloilo City was cleared of Japanese soldiers. In August 1, 1953 during the board meeting of the Board of Trustees, Central Philippine College officially became Central Philippine University – with Dr. Almus Oliver Larsen as the new president of the university.

The painting depicts a woman and a young boy saying grace in a crowded restaurant, as they are observed by other people at their table. Rockwell's inspiration for Saying Grace came from a Saturday Evening Post reader who saw a Mennonite family praying in a restaurant. Rockwell used his son, Jarvis, as one of the models for the painting. Elizabeth Goldberg, director of American Art at Sotheby's said that in his preparations for Saying Grace Rockwell \\"... visited Automats and diners in New York and Philadelphia to get the scene just right ... his imagery was so vivid people would say they recognized the diner even though it didn't exist, each painting felt so universal.\\" Rockwell took the table and chairs from a diner in Times Square for the photo shoot for the painting. In preparations for a painting Rockwell would set up a scene, using his friends and neighbors, taking hundreds of photos until satisfied. Rockwell would produce sketches in charcoal, then oil sketches, before painting the final image. Rockwell was paid $3,500 () for Saying Grace. Readers of The Saturday Evening Post voted Saying Grace their favorite ever cover in 1955. Saying Grace had been on a long term loan at the Norman Rockwell Museum, and had been exhibited at 12 other museums across the United States before its 2013 sale. 2013 sale Saying Grace sold for $46 million (including a buyer's premium) at Sotheby's in December 2013, setting a new record price for Rockwell's art. Rockwell's previous record had been set in 2006 by the $15 million sale of Breaking Home Ties. Saying Grace had been expected to sell for between $15 million and $20 million. The buyer of Saying Grace was not identified. Two other Rockwell paintings that had been loaned to the Norman Rockwell Museum were sold alongside Saying Grace; The Gossips and Walking to Church. The three paintings, along with four other art works by Rockwell, were sold by the descendants of Kenneth J. Stuart, the art director of The Saturday Evening Post. The sale of the art works was initiated after the conclusion of a legal disagreement among Stuart's sons. A long term colleague of Rockwell's, Stuart had been given the paintings by Rockwell as a gift. Saying Grace had hung in Stuart's office at the Saturday Evening Post, and subsequently in the Stuarts' living room in Wilton, Connecticut. Stuart's sons could no longer afford the insurance and upkeep of the paintings by the time of their 2013 sale. Upon Stuart's death in 1993, his estate was divided equally among his three sons, Ken Jr., William, and Jonathan. The oldest brother, Ken Jr., was subsequently sued by William and Jonathan, who claimed that he had forced their father to sign papers so he could gain control of his fortune. They additionally claimed that Ken Jr. had used the assets of his father's estate for his own expenses. The three brothers settled out of court before the sale. The owner of The Saturday Evening Post, Curtis Publishing Company, which retains reproduction rights to Rockwell's artworks, also unsuccessfully attempted to claim ownership of the paintings. The director of the Norman Rockwell Museum, Laurie Norton Moffatt, has expressed her hope that the paintings will eventually be reunited with the museum. Moffatt said of the paintings that \\"We cared for them like children ... We hope they come back some day. We believe that's where they belong.\\" Moffatt said that the loss of the paintings left an \\"irreplaceable hole in the museum's collection.\\" References External links * Detailed record of the painting via the Norman Rockwell Museum website Paintings by Norman Rockwell Religious paintings Works originally published in The Saturday Evening Post 1951 paintings Paintings of children Food and drink paintings ","title":"Saying Grace (Rockwell)"},{"id":"41274218","title":"Raquel Pennington"},{"id":"41274223","text":"Dan Kolsrud is an American film producer.

Wade constructed the first Presbyterian Church in Cincinnati and served as a deacon and elder. He also served as a founding trustee of Cincinnati College (now the University of Cincinnati) and as a county commissioner, township officer, councilman, and first alderman. In 1915, Guy graduated from Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey. He then studied at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey between the fall of 1915 and February 1917 before leaving for Europe to serve in World War I. War service and aviation achievements Guy served as an ambulance driver with the American Field Service (AFS) from February to July 1917. He drove ambulances in Verdun, France for battles at Hill 304 (S.S.U. 15) and le Mort Homme. Guy also served in the AFS unit that carried the American flag to the front. After his AFS service, he joined France's Aeronautique Militaire on July 21, 1917. Guy studied at several French flying schools between August and November; he attended flying schools in Tours, Avord, Pau, and G.D.E. He then began serving with Aeronautique Militaire units, including SPAD biplane units 155, 156, and 38. Guy received a promotion to corporal in September 1917 and then sergeant in May 1918. In July 1918, Guy shot down a German Rumpler reconnaissance plane: \\"I chased a biplace Rumpler down from 5300 meters, and hit him so that he fell between the lines. He put three bullets in my plane—it was my only official victory.\\" (Guy had also shot down a Rumpler over Joncherey, France but the confirmation was unofficial because Guy was not present to confirm it.) This action earned Guy the Croix de Guerre with palm and citation from France on July 29. On November 7, 1918, Guy left the Aeronautique Militaire to join the U.S. Army Air Service with the rank of first lieutenant. He served with the 1st Aero Squadron. Guy served in the Army of Occupation in Trier, Germany from November 20, 1918 to January 5, 1919. Returning to the U.S. in April, Guy received a discharge from the Army at Mitchel Air Force Base in Hempstead Plains on Long Island on April 14, 1919. After World War I, Guy co-founded the National Aeronautical Association's Flying Club of Philadelphia, and he served as its first president. Post-war education and career Following the end of the war, Guy resumed his college studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. He received his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1922. Following graduation, Guy worked for Monsanto Company, a chemical company in Missouri, and then Ingersoll Rand, an Irish industrial company with an American headquarters in Davidson, North Carolina. After working at the First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company in Philadelphia, he co-founded Wellington Foundation and served as their president. The foundation sold Wellington Funds, a type of mutual fund.

His short story, The Scroll, was published in Warriors (2010), and Warriors 2 (2010), anthologies assembled by George R.R. Martin and Gardner Dozois. The short story Provenance was included in an anthology entitled Rogues, published by Bantam Spectra in 2014. Ball's works have been translated into 11 languages. Ball is currently working on his fourth novel. Early life and education Ball, a native of Denver, Colorado, was the middle of five children born to Carol and Jack Ball. His father Jack served in World War II as a pilot, first in the Royal Air Force and then the US Navy. Ball earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Metropolitan State University, Denver, where he was editor of the campus newspaper and active in student politics. He earned a master's of science degree in journalism from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1973. Career Ball has traveled extensively, visiting more than 65 countries on six continents. He has been a pilot, sarcophagus maker, businessman and charity organizer. He drove a taxi in New York City and built a road in West Africa. He installed telecommunications equipment in Cameroun, renovated Victorian houses in Denver and pumped gasoline in the Grand Tetons. Trained in journalism but wishing to write fiction, Ball seriously began work on Empires of Sand in 1994, recovering 100 pages of a manuscript he had written in a Tunisian beach house in 1984 while traveling in North Africa, but later shelving the work to go into business. Empires of Sand, (Bantam 1999), is a historical novel set in the Sahara Desert and 19th-century Paris. The first half of the story involves two cousins growing up during the Prussian Siege of Paris. The narrative shifts to the Sahara in the 1880s, during an ill-fated attempt by the French to drive a railroad through the heart of the desert. The expedition was slaughtered by the Tuareg, a Berber tribe more commonly known as the Blue Men. The book was released in paperback in 2001 (Dell) and as an audio-book. The novel has been translated into French, Spanish, German, Serbian, Dutch, Czech, and Turkish. In the course of researching the book, Ball traveled four times to the Sahara, including once on a 50cc motorcycle across the Hoggar, a remote mountainous region of the Algerian desert, where he stayed with the Tuareg. His second novel, China Run (Simon & Schuster 2002), a contemporary thriller inspired by a true-life incident, is the story of an American woman fleeing the Chinese authorities across remote regions of China with an adopted infant daughter whom the authorities are attempting to take away from her. The novel was based on China's one-child policy. Research for the book took Ball from Shanghai to Hong Kong, including a trip up the Yangtze on a broken-down riverboat, across the Poyang Hu lake in a fishing boat, and through the rugged mountains and forests of south China to Hong Kong. Dubbed \\"a wonderfully orchestrated novel of suspense\\", China Run was translated into Latvian, Hungarian, German, Czech and French and was produced as an audio-book. It was a featured alternate of the Book-of-the-Month Club, the Mystery Guild, the Literary Guild, and the Doubleday Book Club. Ball’s third novel, Ironfire (Delacorte Press 2004), is set during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, in which the Ottoman sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, launched a war fleet against the island of Malta, bastion of the Hospitaller Knights of St. John. More broadly the book details life in the 16th century Mediterranean, from the slave markets of Algiers to the noble houses of France, from the Topkapi seraglio in Istanbul to the great sea battles between galleys. Ball spent several years researching the book in Paris, Valletta, Istanbul, and Algeria. Selected as one of the \\"great reads\\" for the 2004 holiday season by the Rocky Mountain News, Ironfire was published in Great Britain and the Commonwealth nations as The Sword and the Scimitar. It was translated into Turkish, Spanish, Serbian, Polish, Greek, German, and French, and released in paperback, audio, and e-book editions. The Scroll is Ball’s short story published in an anthology, Warriors, edited by George R.R. Martin and Gardner Dozois (Tor 2010). It also was a part of Warriors 2, a paperback edition, and was recorded in an audio edition. Ball currently is working on his fourth novel about art and Occupied Paris. He recently completed a short story that will be included in a cross-genre anthology entitled Rogues to be published by Bantam Spectra in 2014. Personal life In July 1983, Ball met Melinda Stivers Leach. They live on a farm east of Boulder, Colorado, and have two children, Benjamin and Elizabeth. Ball has lived, worked, and conducted research in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas. He explored the Andes in a Volkswagen bus and crossed the Sahara Desert four times, getting lost only once. His interests include skiing, fly-fishing, baseball, and opera.

The term liston refers to the long marble slabs used for paving the streets. The term far el liston, means \\"to walk around the square\\". Several cities in the Veneto have a liston. In Venice it is the name of the walk from St. Mark's Square past the columns of Marco and Todaro. In Verona it is the west side of Piazza Bra. In Padua it is part of the Prato della Valle. In Belluno the liston is in Martyrs' Square (also known as the \\"Campedel\\"). In Rovigo it is the central part of the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II. In Trieste, which has strong ties with Venetian culture, it is called the Corso Italia. In the Greek island of Corfu the locals still use the word to indicate the main promenade of Corfu city. Venice El Liston (1884) by Giacomo Favretto (1849–1887) In Venice the Campo Santo Stefano was a grass area for many centuries, apart from the stone liston. This was the place where Venetians would stroll and meet, and the term for \\"take a walk\\" in the Venetian dialect is still andare al liston. Later the term liston was used for the Piazza San Marco, described as \\"the general rendezvous of the promenaders and ... the fashionable lounge of Venice\\". Writing of 18th century Venice, Giovanni Rossi (1776–1852) describes the liston in the fashionable area near the San Stefano Church. During the carnival young nobles strutted there like peacocks wearing tabàro capes and the \\"most civilized mask\\", the baùta. Although the common people could walk there, according to Rossi, \\"their education was such that commoners left the nobles their space in liberty.\\" Giacomo Favretto depicted El Liston in 1884, showing figures in elegant costumes walking and meeting in the heart of Venice. Belluno Martyrs' Square (, also known as Campedel) in Belluno, is called the \\"living room\\" of the city. The square is just outside the walls of the old city. Some historians claim that shape of the north side of the square was defined by the radius of guns defending the former walls of the city, to the south, which no longer exist. The axis of the square is defined by the liston, a long promenade. According to tradition, the quaint paved liston was made when the city was under the rule of the Venetian Republic. As of 2011 plans to redevelop the square were being considered, retaining the historic liston but removing the road that runs along the southern margin. Padua Padua In Padua, historically, the liston was the stretch of Prato della Valle on the west side, opposite the Loggia Amulea, paved with trachyte in the first half of the 19th century by the architect Giuseppe Jappelli. Typically on Saturdays and on other occasions the walk was used for lively outdoor markets. In recent years the term Liston has come to be extended to the central Via Umberto I, Via Roma, Via Cavour and Via VIII Febbraio, after the pedestrianization of the area between the mid-1980s and the year 2000. This has entered the common language of newspapers and local TV stations, even if technically incorrect. However the term applies well to these roads, since the creation of the pedestrian zone has effectively created a single long walk from Prato della Valle to Piazza Garibaldi. Rovigo In Rovigo there is a liston in both the squares of the historic center, the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II and the Piazza Garibaldi. The second runs along the old boundaries of the Church of Santa Giustina, demolished in 1809. Verona Verona In Verona the liston is the wide sidewalk that borders the Piazza Bra on the west side, curving around the Arena. The piazza is a popular place for both tourists and local people to promenade. The liston is now used for outdoor seating by the many cafés surrounding the piazza. Ferrara Ferrara has a liston next to the Cathedral in the ancient \\"Piazza delle Erbe\\", now called the \\"Piazza Trento & Trieste\\". Although Ferrara is part of the Emilia region, it has many Venetian aspects and is considered a bridge between the Emilian and Venetian culture. Corfu The Liston in Corfu The Liston in Corfu, with arcaded terraces and fashionable cafes, was built in 1807 by the French imperial commissioner Mathieu de Lesseps. It is an excellent example of architecture from the Napoleonic period, when Corfu was part of the First French Empire. The design was inspired by the Rue de Rivoli, Paris. Brewster Chamberlin celebrated it in his 2005 poem Along the Liston, Corfu, describing the Liston as a crowded, relaxed place to sit and snack and watch the promenaders. The Liston runs along one side of the Spianada, part town square and part park. At one time it was a firing range for Venetian troops. Now it holds a cricket pitch, a British innovation that is regularly used by local teams.

He then attended the University of Texas, from which he graduated with a concentration in psychology in 1908. After graduation, he began graduate work at the University of Chicago, where he received a PhD. in psychology.Gram 1959, WALTER SAMUEL HUNTER.\\" Biographical Memoirs,127 Hunter returned to the University of Texas in 1912 as an instructor.

Accomplishments  During his time at the University of Kansas in 1919, he produced his first textbook, entitled General Psychology. While at Clark University, Hunter was the editor of the Psychological Index. He also wrote a second textbook entitled Human Behavior, established Psychological Abstracts, and served as president of the American Psychological Association from 1930 to 1931.APA Presidential Addresses During his time at Clark he also published 21 experimental papers, five theoretical studies, and four book chapters. While he was American Psychological Association President, he delivered an address on the Psychological Study of Behavior.The psychological study of behavior,1930 In 1933, Hunter was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1935, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1936, Hunter became the chairman of the Department of Psychology at Brown University. Psychology and the military Hunter served in the military for sixteen months during World War I. He was the chief psychological examiner in three army camps. During that time he compiled bar graphs with E.S. Jones that showed the predictive value of group psychological tests. His work persuaded government officials to continue the testing program, which ultimately led military officials to order the recording of data on the national origins of the troops tested. The data collected was used in a way that Hunter did not approve; combining the psychological test scores with the location of where the individual grew up supported the notion of Nordic superiority, which was not his intention. Hunter served as chairman of the Division of Anthropology and Psychology of the National Research Council from 1936 to 1938. During this time Hunter's influence contributed to the utilization of psychology by the government and the military during World War II. From 1943-1945, he served as a chairman of the Applied Psychology Panel of the National Defense Research Committee. In 1943, he was unofficially drafted to direct and coordinate research for the military. Little has been publicly documented as to exactly what Hunter did during World War II. However, it was enough for President Truman to award Hunter the President’s Medal for Merit in 1948, for “having recognized that research on the psychological and physiological capacities of man in relation to the new instruments of warfare could contribute materially to the more effective utilization of both military personnel and instruments”. Research Hunter was interested in studying delayed reaction in animals. Through his research, he developed the idea of symbolic process. According to Hunter, this is the process by which specific animals can change their orientation to a stimulus during a delay and afterward still be able to remember where the stimulus was originally. Hunter believed that his work on the aftereffect of visual motion was some of his best. He was so interested in delayed reaction that he expanded his work to include children after the birth of his first daughter. Hunter observed his daughter between the time she was thirteen months old and sixteen months old. Hunter found that young children could demonstrate the appropriate delayed reaction even when their body orientation changed during the delayed period. Hunter agreed with the behaviorist point of view, however he continued to see consciousness and voluntary actions as problems that still needed to be explained. Hunter did not like the term psychology—he preferred to use the term \\"anthroponomy\\" to replace psychology. Hunter wanted to avoid misunderstandings that arise when the term psychology is used to describe his work. The term was not widely accepted and Hunter was mocked for his suggestion.

The club is a famous name in rugby league, having existed before the formation of the Northern Union in 1895. The traditional nickname for the club was 'the Villagers'. Bramley Rugby League Community Club aka Bramley Buffaloes was formed by the fans of the former club with the desire to return to the professional ranks as quickly as possible, continuing the Bramley name, traditions and history. However, The RFL denied the Buffaloes applications twice while admitting other clubs. The second bid was unsuccessful after The RFL changed the application process after the submission date. The new 'phoenix club' was admitted to National League Three in 2004. A Junior club with the Bramley R.L. name was founded in 2015. Running From the Bramley Villagers Social Club, and playing on Pollard Lane, Bramley. History Early history Bramley was founded in 1879. They played at Whitegate Farm and Pollard Lane from their founding and moving to the Barley Mow ground in 1890. The city of Leeds had an abundance of rugby football clubs and although members of the Yorkshire RFU (which was in turn a Constituent Body of the RFU), it was decided to form a ‘more local’ association. It was for this reason that the Leeds & District organisation was formalised when a meeting took place at the Green Dragon Hotel, Leeds on 27 September 1888. The foundation clubs were Bramley, Holbeck, Hunslet, Kirkstall, Leeds Parish Church, Leeds St John’s (later to become Leeds) and Wortley. Bramley’s England international Harry Bradshaw, was the first test case at Twickenham, over \\"broken time payments\\" in 1893, two years before the \\"great schism\\" of 1895 that resulted in the formation of the Northern Union which in time would be renamed as the Rugby League. Bramley was admitted to the new Northern Union on 2 June 1896. The rugby league was then split into two county leagues, Lancashire and Yorkshire. James Lomas became rugby league's first £100 transfer from Bramley to Salford in 1901. On 9 October 1907, they became the first club to entertain a touring side when they played the New Zealand All Golds. On 9 November 1921, the Australian Kangaroos as part of the 1921-22 Kangaroo tour, defeated Bramley 92-7 at Barley Mow. This would remain the highest ever score for an Australian team during a Kangaroo Tour.1921-22 Kangaroo Tour - Bramley vs Australia In 1942-43, Bramley dropped out of the wartime Yorkshire League, they did not return to league competition until 1945-46. Post-war In the 1960s, the club moved to a new ground on land adjacent to Barley Mow, which became known as McLaren Field. Bramley developed the ground into a more modern stadia in 1966. The new ground would help to take them up the leagues. In 1973 the clubs voted to split into two divisions. Arthur Keegan became first team coach. Bramley defeated Wakefield Trinity, Castleford and St. Helens in order to reach the 1973 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy. They won the trophy with a 15-7 away victory over Widnes on 14 December 1973. It was the first cup Bramley had won in their entire history. Ironically, due to power cuts resulting from the Three-Day Week, the final against Widnes at Naughton Park took place on a mid-week afternoon. The club played in the First Division in that 1973-74 season. Though relegated the club had some excellent league wins including an away victory at Headingley against Leeds. The loss of fixtures against Leeds, Wakefield Trinity and Bradford Northern cost the club financially. On Sunday 1 September 1974, Bramley defeated Doncaster 52-17 at McLaren Field in a Yorkshire County Cup, first round tie, this broke the club record which had stood since 1946. The resources of the Villagers could not sustain this success, results and attendances flagged, and Keegan was sacked in September 1976. Bramley won promotion to Division One, under Peter Fox, in the 1976-77 season. Bramley almost went into liquidation in October 1983 but survived. In 1990 the club was faced with an estimated bill of £250,000 to carry out comprehensive safety work at McLaren Field for the start of the 1991-92 season. John Kear was appointed coach in 1992. Bramley RLFC Blue Plaque In January 1994, Bramley announced plans to leave McLaren Field and move in with Northern Premier League Association football club Farsley Celtic. In June 1994, they changed their minds and decided to stay at McLaren Field until the end of the 1994-95 season as Hunslet discussed playing games at McLaren Field instead of Elland Road. The following seasons they played at Clarence Field, Kirkstall, the home of Headingley rugby union club after the previous directors sold McLaren Field for housing and then moved to Headingley in 1997.Rugby League: Old cup kings given fright by Bramley, The Independent, 3 March 1997 Crowd numbers were affected, and the team became ever more overshadowed by Leeds. Leeds players such as Barrie McDermott and Leroy Rivett turned out for Bramley on the way back from injury. In 1999, a possible merger between Hunslet and Bramley was debated. At the end of the 1999 season Bramley resigned from the Northern Ford Premiership to become a feeder team for Leeds, but this never materialised. Bramley applied to rejoin the Northern Ford Premiership in 2000 but was rejected while a similar bid from Gateshead Thunder was accepted. They had planned to play games at the home of soccer club Farsley Celtic and progressively upgrade the ground, this may have been the cause of the rejection. The club (Bramley RLFC (1984) Ltd) retained associate of The Rugby Football League for a while. And continues to exist as a dormant company .

More than 30 people were killed in the attacks that day, while at least 106 were injured.Hostages freed after daring raid on Iraq mall (Al Jazeera) Background From a peak of 3,000 deaths per month in 2006–07, violence in Iraq decreased steadily for several years before beginning to rise again in 2012. In December 2012, Sunnis began to protest perceived mistreatment by the Shia-led government. The protests had been largely peaceful, but insurgents, emboldened by the war in neighboring Syria, stepped up attacks in the initial months of 2013. The number of attacks rose sharply after the Iraqi army raided a protest camp in Hawija on 23 April 2013. Overall, 712 people were killed in April according to UN figures, making it the nation's deadliest month in five years. Conditions continued to deteriorate in May when UNAMI reported at least 1,045 Iraqis were killed and another 2,397 wounded in acts of terrorism and acts of violence, making it the deadliest month in the country since April 2008. Similar death tolls were recorded in July and August and continued later on, as 2013 was on track to be the deadliest year for the country since 2008. Kirkuk attack The assault in Kirkuk began when a suicide-bomber rammed his explosives-laden vehicle into the front gate of a local police intelligence building. Guards at the entrance opened fire at another bomber, who managed to detonate his suicide vest, as a firefight began with a group of six insurgents. After being repulsed by security forces, the remaining attackers, some of them wearing suicide vests, stormed the nearby Jawahir mall and took between 10 and 20 people inside hostage. Some of the militants proceeded to the roof, opening fire on Iraqi forces stationed outside and sparking another major firefight. Authorities managed to free 11 of the hostages and kill all of the attackers to end the siege. Several explosions took place during the attempt to retake the building, setting it on fire and destroying parts of it.Coordinated attack in Kirkuk leaves several dead as violence in Iraq escalates (Euronews, 5 December 2013) Local police later announced that 11 people were killed in the attack, together with 8 attackers, while 54 security personnel and 52 civilians were injured in total. Footage showing the raid was released by TurkmenEli TV on YouTube.TurkmenEli TV footage of the attack (YouTube) Other incidents Several other attacks took place around Iraq on the same day, including a separate bombing in Kirkuk that injured 4 civilians. Gunmen attacked a checkpoint in Hadhimiya, killing 3 policemen and injuring 4 others. In the former insurgent stronghold of Fallujah, a police officer was killed and another injured in a drive-by shooting, while security forces killed a militant leader and his assistant. In other shootings, two civilians were killed in Ramadi and a former police chief was gunned down in Shirqat. In the capital Baghdad, gunmen killed a medical director near the Yarmouk hospital and a man who runs a private generator in Ghazaliya. Police forces shot and killed a suspected militant planting a bomb in the Saidiya neighborhood. In Mosul, a man was killed and his brother injured in a drive-by shooting, while an IED blast and a grenade attack elsewhere injured 3 policemen and 2 civilians.

Moon graduated from Hongik University, attended Tsukuba University, and graduate school at Korea University, resulting in a Ph.D. in Literature. He worked for the Magazine, Shidan and served in many organizations including as President of the Poetry Second of the Korean LIterature Association; President of the Modern Poet's Association; Vice Director of the Korean Literature Association; Director, Vice President, and President of the Korean branch of P.E.N.; Representative of the Korean Committee for the International Poets' Union, and as President of the Korean Culture and Arts Foundation. Moon also taught at Jeju and Hongik University, and served as a Dean of the College of Education at the latter. Work Moon's pen names are Simsan and Cheongtae. Recommended by Yoo Chihwan, he made his literary debut in 1955 with his “Silence” (Chimmuk), “Foil” (Hwaseok) and “In the Wind” (Baram sogeseo) published in Contemporary Literature (Hyeondae munhak).Source-attribution\\"Moon Deoksu\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# The Literature Translation Institute of Korea describes his work :Moon’s poetry can be divided into three categories according to the time of their composition. In his early collections, Entrancement (Hwanghol) and Line and Dimension (Seon, Gonggan), he depicts the workings and the nature of the human mind and creativity in an unrestrained style of free association, and occasionally automatic writing. The second category consists of the poems in the collections The Sea at Dawn (Saebyeok bada), Everlasting Flower Field (Yeongwonhan kkotbat), and Only We Who Survived Greet June (Saranameun urideulmani dasi Yuworeul maja). Here, he severely criticizes the aspects of contemporary civilization which allowed for the proliferation of immorality, conformism, standardization, simplification, and absurdities that in turn have brought about general dehumanization. : :The final, third category includes his last publications, the collections Making Bridges (Dari noki), Reducing Little by Little (Jogeumssik jurimyeonseo), The Mist of Your Words (Geudae malsseumui angae) and Allegro for Encounter (Mannameul wihan allegeuro). He combines conservative themes and concerns with literary experiments to produce an original, effective critique of civilization, nature, and ossified poetic forms. Moon openly rejects black- and-white logic, especially when confronting literature; his work is characterized by restlessness and a thirst for innovation. Moon has been highly praised for crafting sophisticated forms to capture the nature of psychological sentiments and for having employed language as a material with which to build entities rather than empty, merely reflective symbols. He has published, in addition to volumes of poetry, theoretical works such as Understanding Contemporary Literature (Hyeondae munhagui ihae), Theory of Contemporary Korean Poetry (Hyeondae hanguk siron), A Study of Modernism in Korea (Hanguk modeonijeum yeongu), and Reality and Humanist Literature (Hyeonsil gwa hyumeonijeum munhak).

It was found in 1971 as a congress of farmers, but has since formalized into a cooperative serving the interests of 630 coffee farmers from six local sub- groups. The federation was licensed FLO Cert in 2004, and has since acquired certification for producing both conventional and organic coffee. Its mission is “to work in programs and projects so as to provide the necessary services to strengthen its affiliates, improve entrepreneurial and administrative efficiency in order to seek altogether the improvement of social, economic, cultural and living conditions of all coffee producing families”. __TOC__ Mission FCC works to provide comprehensive institutional capacity and the necessary services to strengthen their six grass-roots agricultural organizations, whose collaboration leads to the improvement of social, economic, cultural, and environmental conditions associated farming families. Vision FCC is dedicated to be an organization of socially-minded coffee farmers generating sustainable agricultural development so that they can live with dignity in their fields. Impact For Coffee growers from Fair Trade certification Fair trade certification guarantees farmers a minimum price on their coffee production and links FCC directly with importers, thus creating a more reliable market. Through Fair Trade certification, farmers earn more substantial incomes, thus enabling them to hold on to their land and invest in crop quality. Institutional impact from International Recognition With Fairtrade premium resources, the FCC has established a series of several funds: A revolving fund for micro-credits that allow their partners to invest in the cultivation and increase productivity of the plots (renovation or maintenance of their coffee fields), improve coffee-processing infrastructure and therein the quality of the product establish sustenance crops in complementary areas of coffee production with the objective of improving household incomes. A commercial fund as working capital for the purchase of coffee from local producers. An Investment fund for the purchase of arable land for cultivation the construction of warehouses and offices for the grassroots organizations improved wet and dry coffee-processing infrastructure for certified coffee producers. training for producers on leadership and the qualifications of the fair trade process. In an attempt to improve the quality of the region's coffee production, all individual investments are accompanied by technical support services, the development and transfer of appropriate technologies, Environmental FCC contributes to the conservation of the environment through the promotion of clean farming practices and especially with the ecologically-sound management and processing of coffee production. Specifically, FCC goes to great lengths in waste management, residual water treatment and the exclusive use of organic fertilizers.

Overview Multiplexed Optical Data Storage operates on techniques which store more than a single bit of information within each pit of an optical storage medium. It is currently the subject of active research as to which method will best effect this result, with the polarization of light being the leading contender. So far, polarization has never been used for optical data storage outside of the laboratory, though one can imagine the commercial potential once the technology is perfected, with at minimum a doubling of the storage capacity (i.e. pit, no pit, left pit, right pit: 4 bits vs 2). Studies at the Imperial College of London have found that it is possible to detect the angle of a pits on an optical disc as a result of the polarization imparted upon the detected laser light. Moreover, this polarization detection has the added benefit of increasing the signal to noise ratio. It is claimed that 160 GB of data can be stored on a single layer of a disc when using the aforementioned techniques within the parameters of the Blu-ray Disc format. In other words, using a 405 nm read laser and the standard Blu-ray spacing guidelines, with the only change being the use of polarization to increase data storage per pit, such capacities can be attained. Additional Info The primary team working on this technology has also developed a high numerical aperture simulation for microscopes, which they apply to optical disc read lenses, since these too have a large numerical aperture. They believe that this model is quite rigorous as few assumptions are made in the calculations.

In the fall of 2017, Kapoor was arrested and charged with numerous felony counts including RICO conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and other crimes. In June of 2019, he was found guilty on all counts. Early life John Nath Kapoor was born in Amritsar, India, into a family of modest means. He later moved to Mumbai, where he graduated from the Institute of Chemical Technology (formerly UDCT) with a degree in pharmacy. After moving to the United States, he attended the University at Buffalo on a scholarship and obtained a doctorate in medicinal chemistry in 1972. Career He began his career in 1972 at Invenex Pharmaceutical in Grand Island, New York. He worked his way up at LyphoMed, took the company public and oversaw its operations through a scandal involving lax production standards that resulted in several patients' deaths. Personal life He moved from India to Lake Forest, Illinois. He has four children and now lives in Phoenix, Arizona. The John and Editha Kapoor Charitable Foundation, which supports the fight against cancer, was named after his late wife Editha, who died of breast cancer. The University at Buffalo School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences named their building John and Editha Kapoor Hall, after a donation to the school by John, to honor him and his late wife. On June 3, 2019, the University at Buffalo passed a resolution to remove Kapoor's name from the UB Pharmacy School's building in light of Kapoor's RICO conviction. Legal issues In October 2017, Kapoor was arrested in Arizona and charged with RICO conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. The charges stem from allegations that he participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid manufactured under the brand name Subsys by his company Insys Therapeutics. U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said the charges reflected authorities' commitment to combat the opioid epidemic. Kapoor is also alleged to have conspired to defraud health insurance providers. Shortly after the charges were announced, Kapoor resigned from the Board of Insys Therapeutics. On May 2, 2019, Kapoor was convicted of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy to increase the profits of his company's opiate painkiller, Subsys. On January 23, 2020, he was sentenced to 5.5 years in prison and described as a \\"former billionaire\\"; Federal prosecutors had asked for 15 years.

He is said to have destroyed many of his own works, and those that become available at auction are now highly sought after. Early life Bahman Mohasses was born in 1931 in Rasht, Iran. The Mohasses house consisted of approximately 15 families who were land owners of Lahijan and were in the trade of tea and silk and lived in the Pordsar neighborhood of Lahijan. According to Hossein Mahjoobi, \\"All Mohasseses had strange personalities, but Bahman seemed to be the most complex and unique of them.\\" In his autobiographical documentary Fifi Howls from Happiness, Mohasses mentions that he is descended from the Mongols on his father's side and the Qajars on his mother's side. At age 14 he learned painting by apprenticing with Seyyed Mohammed Habib Mohammedi, who had studied at the Russian Academy of Arts. He moved with his family from Rasht to Tehran, where he attended Tehran's Faculty of Fine Arts. During the same period he joined the \\"Cockfight Art and Culture Society\\" (Anjoman-e Khorous Jangi), established by Jalil Ziapour, and was, for some time, the editor of the literary and art weekly \\"Panjeh Khoroos\\" (Rooster Foot).\\"Mohasses, Bahman\\" in The Iranian Modern Art Movement: The Iranian Collection of the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, (Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art: Tehran, 2006), page 310. Through this period, he was part of an avant-garde artistic movement, which included his good friend Nima Yooshij, known as the 'father of modern Persian poetry'; along with Sohrab Sepehri, Houshang Irani and Gholamhossein Gharib, who were all considered progressive artists of their time.\\"Mohasses, Progressive and Recluse\\" (Mohasses' obituary on BBC Persian) (in Persian) In 1954 he moved to Italy to study at the Fine Art Academy of Rome. Personal life In 1977, he married Nezhat-al-Molook, the daughter of his father's cousin, who was a teacher in Bandar-e-Anzali and later became the head of the Teaching College for Women. She died of brain cancer around 1998. Mohasses said he was proud of his homosexuality and lived it fully. He was a cousin of the celebrated Iranian illustrator and cartoonist, Ardeshir Mohasses, residing in New York. Career He returned to Iran in 1964 and participated in Venice, São Paulo and Tehran Biennale. Mohasses directed plays, including Pirandello's Henry IV at Goethe Institute and Ghandriz Hall in Tehran. He also translated books of a number of authors, including Eugène Ionesco, Malaparte and Pirandello. He stayed in Iran until 1968, before returning to Rome 1954, where he received commissions for statutes to be placed in Tehran. Some of his public works in Iran were destroyed or damaged after the Islamic Revolution, with the artist subsequently destroying all his remaining works in Iran. He occasionally travelled to Iran and died in self-imposed seclusion in Rome in 2010. Legacy \\"Irreverent and uncompromising, a gay man in a hostile world, Mohassess had a conflicted relationship with his homeland—revered by elites in the art scene and praised as a national icon, only to be censored later by an oppressive regime. Known for his iconoclastic art as well as his scathing declarations, Mohasses abandoned the country over 30 years ago for a simple, secluded life in Italy.\\" Mohasses, unlike many of his contemporaries, did not make references to Persian artistic traditions and had a modern outlook. His paintings and sculptures depicted mythical Minotaurs and creatures out of nightmares in vast deserts of hopelessness. After the Iranian revolution of 1979 he destroyed some of his work. In the marketplace, his artworks range from US$50,000 up to $1M USD for the extremely rare pieces that are thought to have been destroyed, aside from a couple that are owned by private collectors, such as his painting \\"Requiem Omnibus\\". Many of his surviving pieces have been kept privately by collectors. Some of his most sought after and popular paintings (among others) are \\"Fifi Howls from happiness\\" and \\"Requiem Omnibus\\" (death of Martin Luther King ), which are supposedly owned by a private collectors.  In the media  In 2013, Mitra Farahani wrote and directed the documentary Fifi Howls from Happiness (original title: Fifi az khoshhali zooze mikeshad) in which she interviews Bahman Mohasses in the room of the hotel he had secluded himself. The film, which ends abruptly with Mohasses beginning to die from lung cancer literally on camera, explores the enigma of this provocative artist and presents a \\"final biography, in his own words and on his terms.\\" See also * Culture of Iran * Islamic art * Iranian art * List of Iranian artists References  External links  \\"Ibrahim Golestan, Bahman Mohasses and Fifi Howls from Happiness\\" (in Persian) * \\"Biography of Bahman Mohasses\\" (in Persian) * \\"Mohasses, Progressive and Recluse\\" (Mohasses' obituary on BBC Persian) (in Persian) 1931 births 2010 deaths Iranian painters Iranian theatre directors LGBT artists from Iran Gay artists People from Rasht ","title":"Bahman Mohasses"},{"id":"41274884","text":"Jan Latalski was a prominent leader of the masses in the Puri District, famous for the Jagannath and Konark Temples.

The pianist, Torrie Zito, wrote new arrangements for Bennett's large session orchestra. The album was reissued by Concord with the addition of a separately recorded 13-minute Cole Porter medley.

He was the ideologue of educational changes of Liberal Reform in Guatemala and then in Honduras. He served as Principal Minister during the rule of his cousin, Dr. Marco Aurelio Soto and was associated with Soto's mining investments.  Biography  Ramón Rosa, was the son of Juan José Soto and Isidora Rosa. He learned his first letters with a famous teacher in Honduras, who he later portrayed as the central character in his book The Scholastic teacher. He graduated BA in philosophy at the National University of Tegucigalpa and then attended college of law at the Faculty of Law and Notary of the National University of Guatemala where he was a classmate of his would-be inseparable cousin, Marco Aurelio Soto and the future archbishop of Guatemala, Ricardo Estrada Casanova . In this institution he studied with historian and diplomat Jose Milla and Vidaurre and former President of Colombia Dr. Mariano Espina, who had arrived to Guatemala in exile. He graduated in October 1871, at the age of 23. Shortly before, he had joined the Liberal Party in this country and had attacked the Conservative government of Marshal Vicente Cerna with articles in the newspaper El Central, which he co- founded. When the Liberal Reform triumphed in Guatemala, in June of that year, El Central supported the candidacy of General Miguel Garcia Granados in the plebiscite that was convened to elect a president between García Granados and Justo Rufino Barrios, the other liberal caudillo. During the government of García Granados he served as deputy director of Finance and then the Ministry of Education in the government of Justo Rufino Barrios . During this government, was in charge of educational renewal in Guatemala, using the following liberal principles of government: * Definitive separation of Church and State * Deleting mandatory tithes * Extinction of the brotherhoods * Establishment of civil marriage * secularization of cemeteries * Creation of civil registration * Establishment of secular education in all schools of the republic * Instituting free primary school * Reorganization of the university, to remove theology courses. Marco Aurelio Soto The office of Education was in the hands of Honduran intellectuals Rosa and Marco Aurelio Soto, who alternated their functions between it and the office of Foreign Affairs. The thought of both, strongly anticlerical, liberal intellectuals was reflected in liberal reforms education and religion in Guatemala, is summarized in these writings by Rosa in 1882: \\"In America, where popular instruction is spreading with the speed of light, and where it does not exist, as in Europe, deeply rooted and traditional religious interests, giving power and privilege to certain social classes; in our America, where freedom of conscience is already a definitive conquest: all, all the great religions have to disappear, at no distant day, with its artificial and contradictory dogmas, their liturgical theatrical devices, with their bloody histories, with their selfish and worldly interests badly disguised, with their hypocritical sanctities, and their privileged castes, and their execrable tyranny [...] \\". The government of Justo Rufino Barrios gradually was taking a dictatorial tone, and began to interfere in the politics of neighboring states to achieve the Central American Union. After a political ploy succeeded in overthrowing the government of Honduras, Barrios enthroned Marco Aurelio Soto and Ramón Rosa in the government of Honduras. Both left their ministries in Guatemala and landed in Amapala in 1876, inaugurating the provisional government, in which Rosa served as secretary general from 1876 to 1893. Rosa was also a business partner of mine and baking firms in Honduras. Ramón Rosa had married Mature in Guatemala.  Marco Aurelio Soto Presidency  In 1876 the Conservative government of José María Medina in Honduras was crumbling, especially with the scandal of loans for the construction of Rail transport in Honduras and the disappearance of political and representatives of Honduras abroad. Honduran liberal requested changes in public administration of the State. Guatemalan President, seeing here the opportunity to establish a liberal and related to their interests in Honduras Central Union regime, led to the arrival of Marco Aurelio Soto as president, along with his cousin, Ramón Rosa. In early 1876, following elections in El Salvador where Andrés del Valle was elected, Barrios met with him in El Chingo, which agreed to support the invasion of Honduras to install Marco Aurelio Soto, who had previously served as Minister Foreign and Education in Guatemala along with Rosa. Barrios and Valle pledged to give a thousand men for the cause, but political events were precipitated against Valle, due to mistrust of Barrios for the permanence in the government of Marshal Gonzalez, who was serving as vice president after being President before Valle. Alleging that El Salvador had invaded Guatemala, diplomatic relations were broken; actions kicked off on 1 April. 1876, by a naval blockade by the steamer \\"The General Barrios\\". Subsequently, the ground invasion entered from the east where the Guatemalan General Gregorio Solares Pasaquina defeated the Salvadoran army, taking control of San Miguel and La Union; on the western front, after several clashes during Holy Week, the Guatemalan Army weakened the Salvadoran forces under Marshal González. Finding himself in this situation, Marshal Santiago González sent President Valle and E. Jacinto Mejia Castellanos to negotiate with Barrios, who reached a peace agreement in Chalchuapa on 25 April, on condition that Valle left office and González the army leadership, leaving the streets of Santa Ana and San Salvador to Guatemalan forces. As one of the commitments made in Chalchuapa, Valle before leaving the presidency convened a Board of Notables Santa Ana to ratify the agreement of 25 April to elect who would assume the presidency, provided Barrios approved the candidates. At such meeting in Santa Ana gathered around two hundred Salvadoran coffee landowners, merchants, politicians, military and lawyers, who according to Barrios elected as president Dr. Rafael Zaldívar. Soto entered Honduras with the help of Barrios and was proclaimed as the Twentieth President of Honduras for the period from 1876 to 1880. His ideologue and Minister General was Ramon Rosa, who undertake an arduous task of transforming the nation of Honduras following the liberal precepts that had already been used in Guatemala. The transformation was based on the same principles as used Barrios Guatemala; administrative and legal reorganization of Honduras was hand-in-hand with increasing openness to foreign capital, especially that of the United States; President Soto -already owner of a substantial fortune- founded the \\"Rosario Mining Company\\" with the New York businessman S. Valentine in December 1879. Rosa gave the law and the education system the imprint of positivist philosophy, which was reflected in the Code of Public Instruction (1882). He tried to attract foreign investment in mining and agriculture, after the project of developing a national scale coffee economy not bear fruit.  Exile and death  When Soto was forced to resign as president in May 1883 by the pressure of Guatemalan troops that his former ally General Justo Rufino Barrios sent to the border, Rosa Soto went to Costa Rica and Guatemala . He was in Alajuela, Costa Rica between 1885 and 1886, and did not return to Honduras until 1889, continuing his journalistic work with the founding of the journal Guacerique. Rosa also proposed the organization of the Progressive Party in the general election of Honduras in 1891, although the party was dissolved shortly after. Then began a period of political instability in Honduras, led by Dr. Policarpo Bonilla, who later founded the Liberal Party of Honduras.  Works published  According to Medardo Mejia, Ramón Rosa was who penetrated more strongly in the bowels of the Honduran reality, and to this day his dignity and style of his thinking are unsurpassed. He had faith in the steady progress and the value of institutions as well. Ramón Rosa excelled in the genre of the essay and biography: * Social Constitution in Honduras * General Considerations on the Independence of Central America * The Political Parties * Keynote Speech at the Central University of Honduras * Awareness of the Past Examples of biographies: * Biography of Don Jose Milla and Vidaurre * Biography of Father Reyes, Tegucigalpa, 1965 * Wise Biography José Cecilio del Valle, Tegucigalpa, 1965 * History of Meritorious General Don Francisco Morazan, Tegucigalpa 1971. According to Rafael Heliodoro Valle, both Rosa and Soto were the statesman who led the material and intellectual transformation of Honduras from 1876 to 1883. Rosa believed in freedom in terms of progress. He stated that \\"Rosa was above all a scholar, a speaker who was using the rostrum and desk he used the press to disseminate ideas and credentialing of his vocation as a thinker\\".

This poem is one of nineteen in Blake's collection Songs of Innocence.  Analysis of the poem  \\"Laughing Song\\" is a lyric poem, written in three stanzas of four-beat lines rhyming aabb. The title of this poem and its rhyme scheme is very appropriate for the message that Blake is trying to convey. The title in itself states that this is a song about laughter, and the three stanzas give this impression, especially in the final line of the second stanza: \\"With their sweet round mouths sing 'Ha, Ha, He.' \\", and the final line of the third stanza: \\"To sing the sweet chorus of 'Ha, Ha, He.' \\" Using words like \\"sing\\" and \\"chorus\\" for emphasis, Blake sets out to lure readers to the happiness of prelapsarian times, when things were unspoiled and innocent. Blake is inviting the readers to take part in the celebration; after all nature and all the people have begun to laugh and be merry, he wants all to come join in the song. In the idea of prelapsarian/postlapsarian times, he knows that this great joy will not last forever. The poem begins with the laughter and happiness of nature in the first stanza, personifying the wood, hills, and air. In the second stanza, Blake gradually goes on to the \\"grasshopper\\" and \\"Mary and Susan and Emily,\\" the children who will also join in the singing of the \\"Ha, Ha, He.\\" The children and grasshopper also reiterate the idea of innocence and joy. Repetition of the words \\"merry\\" and \\"laughs/laughing\\" also emphasises the overall tone of the poem. Illustration The illustration shows what Blake was trying to express. It shows an outdoor gathering or celebration in which all are one with nature, and laugh with the trees as expressed in the poem. The colours in the image are vibrant, and the border of birds adds a joyous touch.

Anderson. First announced in 2011, it is a sequel to Anderson's seven-book series, The Saga of Seven Suns (2002–2008). The first novel, The Dark Between the Stars, was released by Tor Books on June 3, 2014. The second book in the series, Blood of the Cosmos, was published on June 2, 2015. The third novel, called Eternity's Mind, was released on September 13, 2016. In the story, the human and alien Ildiran civilizations have barely recovered from the universe- spanning elemental war chronicled in The Saga of Seven Suns, and now a new threat to their existence appears. In 2015, The Dark Between the Stars received a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Novel. Origins Anderson published the seven-volume The Saga of Seven Suns series from 2002 to 2008. Discussing the forthcoming sequel trilogy, he said in January 2013 that despite the series' length and complexity he \\"had some major plotlines that just couldn’t fit within the 7-volume series ... I kept files and files of even bigger ideas that deserved full treatment, but I had to wait for the right time.\\" After the Seven Suns series was completed, Anderson published the Terra Incognita fantasy trilogy, the Hellhole trilogy and began the Dune prequel trilogy Great Schools of Dune with Brian Herbert. He later said of this period, \\"After living for eight years in the Seven Suns universe, I needed to explore some other literary landscapes,\\" noting that \\"all the while, a 'next generation' trilogy for Seven Suns was taking shape in my mind—The Saga of Shadows.\\" Anderson announced the new trilogy on his blog in December 2011. Citing National Novel Writing Month, an annual internet-based creative writing project that challenges participants to write 50,000 words of a novel during the month of November, Anderson said in 2013, \\"once I started The Dark Between the Stars, I plunged in headfirst, and wrote 120,000 words of draft in October and 120,000 words of draft in November.\\" He called the book \\"my longest novel so far\\", and noted that the sequel series \\"has been building inside my imagination for many years, and it was like a hunting dog straining at the leash, ready to be released.\\" He added, \\"I love having a story this big to play with, and all those characters to turn loose in the story.\\" Anderson has compared the Seven Suns and Shadows series to \\"really big\\" works like Star Wars, the Dune saga, Vernor Vinge’s A Fire Upon the Deep, Peter F. Hamilton’s The Night's Dawn Trilogy, Joan D. Vinge’s The Snow Queen and The Summer Queen, and has even called it \\"a science fiction version of George R. R. Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire\\". Setting It has been twenty years since the events of The Saga of the Seven Suns, in which an ancient war among four elemental races is reignited and nearly destroys both the human race and the alien Ildirans. The new Confederation has governed human civilization across its many colonized planets since the end of the Elemental War, and relations between the humans and Ildirans are harmonious. Peace and commerce have been restored, with the Roamers back in the business of mining and selling the valuable stardrive fuel ekti (required for faster-than-light travel) and the green priests of Theroc providing instantaneous trans-galactic communication via their sentient worldtrees. But the malevolent Klikiss robots are plotting their revenge from exile, and soon find an ally in the ancient Shana Rei, the destructive personification of darkness and chaos which has awakened from millennia of slumber to destroy all sentient life in the universe. Book 1: The Dark Between the Stars (2014) The Dark Between the Stars is the first book in The Saga of Shadows trilogy by Kevin J. Anderson, published by Tor Books on June 3, 2014. The trilogy is a sequel to Anderson's seven-book series, The Saga of Seven Suns (2002–2008). Anderson revealed the novel's title in 2013, and subsequently chronicled its progress on his blog. In April 2015 the novel was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel. Plot Twenty years after the Elemental War, humanity is governed by the benevolent Confederation, and relations with the alien Ildirans have returned to their pre-war harmony. But the malevolent Klikiss robots are plotting their revenge from exile, and soon find an ally in the ancient Shana Rei, the destructive personification of darkness and chaos which has awakened from millennia of slumber to destroy all sentient life in the universe. Critical reception David Pitt of Booklist wrote in his starred review, “Anderson hits it out of the galaxy again: space opera doesn’t get much more exciting, or much more richly populated with alien races, technologies, and cultures, than it does in this sprawling, engrossing epic.” However Publishers Weekly stated that \\"the multitudinous characters offer more variety than depth, the world-building strains for verisimilitude, and the complex plot comes to feel meandering and grandiose,\\" adding that the novel \\"replicates the original series’ flaws.\\" Kirkus Reviews also said of the novel,\\"With a cast of thousands ... it’s hard to remember who anybody is or what they do. Narrating in his usual breezy style, and untroubled by scientific fact, Anderson just lays it on with a trowel—and the upshot’s a book that’s so busy communicating everything in general that it forgets to be about something in particular.\\" Book 2: Blood of the Cosmos (2015) Blood of the Cosmos is the second book in The Saga of Shadows trilogy by Kevin J. Anderson, published by Tor Books on June 2, 2015. The trilogy is a sequel to Anderson's seven-book series, The Saga of Seven Suns (2002–2008).

Orange line will begin at Thailand Cultural Centre station and run eastward to Suwinthawong. In 2020, cabinet approved the extension of Orange line from Thailand Cultural Centre westward to Bang Khun Non.  Major accident record  On 17 January 2005, just after 09:15, an empty train returning to the depot collided with a peak-hour train filled with passengers at the Thailand Cultural Centre station. 140 people were hurt, most of whom sustained only minor injuries, and the entire Metro network was shut down for two weeks. After initial investigations, it was found that the empty train had run into problems shortly before the accident, grinding to a halt on a curve leading to the depot. The driver applied its brake and was waiting to be towed to the maintenance center close to Thailand Cultural Centre station. A rescue train was attempting to connect to the stalled train when the driver was told to release the brake while coupling had not yet been successful. It was then that the empty train began to roll backwards at a speed of ten meters per second, before smashing into the other train, which was carrying passengers. Therefore, it was believed that the incident was caused by negligence due to insufficient training of operation staff. This accident also resulted in two damaged trains with heavily damaged areas limited to the two leading cars. The colliding speed was suspected to be about 60 km/h due to the appearance of damaged areas. However, one train, which was rebuilt from the repair of the minor-damaged cars, was already fitted for operation at the end of 2006 and the remaining one was still under heavy repair until mid of 2007; it was put into service in October, 2007. The cost resulting from the accident might be a much higher figure than BMCL quoted, and it was expected to be at least 400 million baht, which was totally insured by a local insurance company. The Metro resumed full operation on 1 February 2005, and passenger numbers soon rose back to pre-crash levels, partly due to a temporary promotional fare scheme which allowed passengers to travel any distance on the MRT for only ten baht (~0.33 USD).ข่าวดังข้ามเวลา : บทเรียนใต้พิภพ (21 มี.ค.59)  References  MRT (Bangkok) stations Railway stations opened in 2004 2004 establishments in Thailand ","title":"Thailand Cultural Centre MRT station"},{"id":"41275203","text":"Fever Hunting is the fourth studio album by American hardcore punk band Modern Life Is War.

There are French, German, English translations of the play, and an English novelization-translation. It was the most popular drama during the Ming dynasty,Tanaka, p. 153. and it became a model for Ming drama as it was the favorite opera of the first Ming emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. Plot Gao Ming, circa 1305-1359 The play is set during the Han dynasty. Based on an older play, Zhao zhen nü (The Chaste Maiden Zhao), it tells the story of a loyal wife named Zhao Wuniang (T: 趙五孃, S: 赵五娘, P: Zhào Wǔniáng, W: Chao Wu-niang) who, left destitute when her husband Cai Yong is forced to marry another woman, undertakes a 12-year search for him. During her journey, she plays the pipa of the play's title in order to make a living. The original story sees Zhao killed by a horse and Cai struck by lightning, however in Gao Ming's version the two are eventually reconciled and live out their lives happily. Gao reportedly composed The Lute over a three-year period of solitary confinement, locking himself in an attic room and wearing down the floorboards by tapping out the rhythms of his songs. The Lute won considerable critical acclaim amongst Gao's contemporaries, since it raised the popular and somewhat rustic form of Southern folk opera to a high literary standard, and it became a model for Ming dynasty theatre. It was a favourite play of the first Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, who commanded that it be performed every day at court. Translations Antoine (A. P. L.)

The station broadcasts an Adult Standards format and is owned by Mountain Lakes Broadcasting Corp.KTLO-FM fcc.gov. Accessed December 4, 2013 History On January 7, 1969, Mountain Home Broadcasting Corporation, the owner of KTLO (1240 AM), filed with the Federal Communications Commission to build a new FM radio station in Mountain Home. The construction permit was granted on July 1, 1970, and KTLO-FM began broadcasting at 98.3 MHz on January 11, 1971. $30,000 in new equipment was installed at the KTLO studios on Highway 5 to prepare for the launch of the stereo outlet. KTLO-FM broadcast from a hilltop tower located west of the studios and AM transmitter site. Early FM programming was in a block format, with contemporary and country music interspersed with news features. KTLO-AM-FM was sold in 1975 to four new investors for $400,000. By the mid-1980s, KTLO had settled into a middle-of-the-road music format known as \\"Stardust 98\\". The 1990s saw ownership and technical changes for KTLO-FM. The former began with a $775,000 sale of KTLO-AM-FM to Charles and Scottie Earls in late 1994. The Earls oversaw a major technical overhaul for the FM outlet: in 1996, it increased its power to 50,000 watts and relocated to 97.9 MHz from a transmitter on Crystal Mountain, with the programming remaining the same. The Earls divested their remaining shares in KTLO-AM-FM and KCTT-FM 101.7 to the Ward and Knight families in 2010 in a transaction that gave the Earls full control of KOMC-FM and KRZK in Branson, Missouri; the two families had previously been minority owners in Mountain Lakes. Among KTLO-FM's regular programs is Talk of the Town, an interview show. Talk of the Town had previously been hosted by Brenda Nelson, who retired after 34 years on air in 2009 after airing some 8,000 interviews.

The most significant exceptions to this are thought to be the years of the Greater Wrath when Finland was under Russian occupation which lasted from 1712 to 1721, and the single years missed during both the 1917 militia strike and the Winter War year of 1939.

In 1909 in Berlin Hundhausen began practicing law and working as a notary. During World War I Hundhausen initially served as an officer. He became a prosecutor serving in Eastern Europe for the Commander-in-Chief of the East. By the year 1923, Hundhausen had become a specialist in property administration and guardianship. In 1923, Hundhausen was the executor of the Pape-assets in Tianjin and he had been asked to settle an inheritance case there. He stated that he had a lack of knowledge and awareness of China when he traveled there at age 45.Bieg, p. 68. Hundhausen stayed in China, living and working there for 31 years, with one short interruption. In 1946 Hundhausen stated that after he first arrived in China he decided to stay there because he foresaw political developments that would occur in Germany. He worked for the State University of Peking as a professor of German literature. From 1924 to 1937 he taught \\"German and World Literature\\" at the university.Bieg, p. 69. In China he also became a publisher-printer, a poet, and a translator. In western Beijing he lived in an estate called \\"Poplar Island\\" (Pappelinsel), located west of the former Beijing city wall,Merker, p. 242. near the former wall's southwestern corner. It was his base for printing, publishing, translating, and writing of poetry. His business was called the Poplar Island Press (Merker, p. 243. or , ) In the late 1930s about 40 employees worked for the business in the house's courtyards. In 1926 he sent letters to the Parliament of Germany urging the country to not join the Nine Power Treaty. He wrote that his letters were successful in \\"preventing Germany at the very last moment from joining to the Nine Power Treaty, already passed by the legislative body, which was to be repeatedly abused to China’s detriment\\". After the institutionalized German community was founded in 1935, he refused to join it. He resigned from the Zhong de Xuehui (), the German government's \\"German Institute\\" located in China. The Nazis forced him to leave his university position in 1937. The German Ambassador to China commented on Hundhausen's expulsion from his position by stating \\"only such teaching staff are required as are better able to serve the new political era in Germany.\\" That year, Hundhausen took control of Peking University's printing press, keeping it away from the control of the invading Japanese. He used it to increase his printing business. He said that several hundred cultural works had been produced with it. In 1954 the Chinese government expelled him, and he was deported to Germany. Annette Merker wrote that \\"Hundhausen’s isolation in China during the war years, his intellectual isolation from Germany, and not least the violent political upheavals in China, which caused him, unlike other Germans, to be expelled from that country, prevented him from making a new start in Germany.\\"Merker, p. 244. He died in Grevenbroich in 1955. Translations and publications Odes of Horace was Hundhausen's first translation. Hundhausen had completed translation work done by Christoph Martin Wieland, who had done his own translation of the Odes of Horace in 1872 and that of the satires in the period 1784 to 1786. Lutz Bieg, author of \\"Literary translations of the classical lyric and drama in the first half of the 20th century: The \\"case\\" of Vincenz Hundhausen (1878-1955)\\", wrote that Hundhausen was \\"probably inspired\\" by Wieland, who Hundhausen had \\"greatly admired\\" and had made as \\"one of his German idols\\".Bieg, p. 67-68. Hundhausen had translated Chinese poetry and dramas into German. During the decade of the 1920s, he translated over 120 Chinese texts, with most of them being poems. His translations began appearing after 1926.Bieg, p. 70. Poems translated by Hundhausen include those of Bai Juyi, Li Taibo, Su Dongpo, and Tao Yuanming. He also made German translations of philosophical tracts by Laozi and Zhuangzi. In 1930 he wrote a German translation for Tale of the Pipa (Pipa ji). In 1937 he published a German translation of The Peony Pavilion (Mudan ting) by Tang Xianzu. He also translated Wang Shifu's The Western Chamber, as well as Tang Xianzu's The Soul's Return. Hartmut Walravens, author of \\"German Influence on the Press in China,\\" wrote that Hundhausen was a \\"masterly translator\\". Bieg stated that Hundhausen had an \\"apparently rather limited knowledge of the (literary? classical?) Chinese language\\" and that he was an \\"amateur sinologist\\", his colleagues and helpers, including Feng Zhi and Xu Daolin, were \\"excellent\\". In 1946 he wrote \\"Mein Lebenslauf\\" (My life), an autobiographical work. He had a German-language theater company, Pekinger Bühnenspiele, which performed Chinese dramas in the German language, and also created publications. In its dramas the company used Chinese and German actors and catered to mostly German audiences in Beijing. It also conducted tours in Qingdao, Tianjin, in Shanghai. The theater company and Hundhausen toured Austria and Switzerland in the northern hemisphere spring of 1936. In addition he edited and was responsible for several sonderausgaben (C: 特刊, P: tèkān) special issues of the Deutsch-Chinesische Nachrichten. These issues included, on anniversaries of famous people, the famous peoples' articles, translations and texts to celebrate them. He had published festschrifts about Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Wilhelm von Humboldt, von Platen, Friedrich Schiller, Baruch Spinoza, and Christoph Martin Wieland. Erwin von Zach has a positive reception to Hundhausen's work. Some academics criticized Hundhausen. Erich Schmitt, a professor based in Bonn, Germany, accused Hundhausen of plagiarism.

However, some church leaders have contested the claimed exclusively Christian character of such groups. The Tony Blair Faith Foundation and journalist Andrew Katz have noted that animists also participate in Anti-balaka groups. This militia formed in the Central African Republic after the rise to power of Michel Djotodia in 2013.C.Africa militia is an enemy of peace: French commander, apa.az, recovered 14 March 2014 Amnesty International reported in 2015 that some members of anti-balaka groups have forcibly converted Muslims to Christianity.Central African Republic: Unprotected Muslims forced to abandon religion, Amnesty International UK (July 31, 2015). Anti-balaka groups have also kidnapped, burnt and buried alive in public ceremonies women accused of being 'witches'. Terminology Though \\"anti-balaka\\" is often translated as \\"antimachete\\", its origin is explained: History Some commentators have said that village militias formed in the 1990s to protect against highwaymen were a precursor to the Antibalaka. Unable to provide security throughout the remote areas of the country, President François Bozizé organized, self-protection groups in 2009 to combat crime on the village level; these took the name Antibalaka. In March 2013, President Bozizé (a Christian) was overthrown by a coup during the Central African Republic Civil War by a mostly Muslim rebel coalition known as Séléka. The leader of the Séléka, Michel Djotodia, became the first Muslim president of the country. With the disbanding of the army by Djotodia, many army members joined the militia, boosting their numbers and helping train them. Djotodia announced the dissolution of the Séléka in September 2013, but most of the militias refused to disband. The Séléka and the anti-balaka engaged in a cycle of increasing violence. As many Christians had more settled lifestyles and many Muslims were nomadic, competing claims to the land were another dimension of the tensions. In November 2013, the UN warned that the country was at risk of spiraling into genocide, and was \\"descending into complete chaos\\". France described the country as \\"...on the verge of genocide\\". On 2 December 2013, anti-balaka militiamen are suspected to have killed 12 people, including children, and wounded 30 others in an attack on the mostly-Muslim Fula in Boali, according to the government. This was amidst the Central African Republic conflict under the Djotodia administration. Early 2014 marked a turning point; hardened by war and massacres, the anti-balaka committed multiple atrocities. In December 2013, UNICEF reported that in sectarian violence in Bangui, at least two children were beheaded and one of them was mutilated.Mark Tran & agencies, Children 'beheaded and mutilated' in Central African Republic, says Unicef, The Guardian (December 30, 2013). In 2014, Amnesty International reported several massacres committed by anti-balaka militias against Muslim civilians, forcing thousands of Muslims to flee the country. In 2014, the corpse of Camille Lepage, a missing French photojournalist, was found by French soldiers in a truck used by Anti-Balaka members.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/13/french-photojournalist- camille-lepage-killed-central-african-republic  List of Anti-balaka leaders  * Maxim Mokom – leader of Mokom branch.

Pieces such as “Self-portrait”(Jahwasang) and “Deer” (Saseum) are existential explorations of solitude. Her second collection, Changbyeon, which was published after Korean independence from Japan, expanded upon the themes in her Coral Forest melancholy, solitude, love and nostalgia and is often considered an extension of her first collection. Both volumes are characterized by a lyrical intertwining of solitude and nostalgia in simple, delicate language. The poems at once delineate the solitary space where connection with another is impossible and express a kind of anti-nostalgia in the hopes of transcending the past.

From 2005 Wheeler was a technology entrepreneur and executive at Core Capital Partners. Originally considered a frontrunner for the position, Wheeler was confirmed as the new Federal Communications Commission chief in November 2013 following a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.Nomination of Thomas E. Wheeler to be Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission: Hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, United States Senate, One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First Session, June 18, 2013 Despite a letter written by several prominent former Obama administration officials endorsing Wheeler for the position, many people expressed concern over the consideration of Wheeler for the position due to his history of lobbying for industry. In recognition of his work in promoting the wireless industry, Wheeler was inducted into the Wireless Hall of Fame in 2003 and in 2009, as a result of his work in promoting the growth and prosperity of the cable television industry and its stakeholders, was inducted into the Cable Television Hall of Fame. He is the only person who is a member of both halls of fame. Cablevision magazine named Wheeler one of the 20 most influential individuals in its history during cable's 20th anniversary in 1995. During Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, Wheeler spent six weeks in Iowa aiding his campaign efforts and went on to raise over US$500,000 for Obama's campaigns. Net neutrality In late April 2014, the contours of a document leaked that indicated that the FCC under Wheeler would consider announcing rules that would violate net neutrality principles by making it easier for companies to pay ISPs (including cable companies and wireless ISPs) to provide faster \\"lanes\\" for delivering their content to Internet users. These plans received substantial backlash from activists, the mainstream press, and some other FCC commissioners. In May 2014, over 100 Internet companies—including Google, Microsoft, eBay, and Facebook—signed a letter to Wheeler voicing their disagreement with his plans, saying they represented a \\"grave threat to the Internet\\". As of May 15, 2014, the \\"Internet fast lane\\" rules passed with a 3–2 vote. They were then open to public discussion that ended July 2014. In November 2014, President Obama gave a speech endorsing the classification of ISPs as utilities under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.Wheeler: Obama didn't influence net neutrality vote Yahoo! Finance, March 3, 2015 Wheeler stated in January 2015 that the FCC was \\"going to propose rules that say no blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization\\" at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.FCC Head Plans to Heed Obama Blueprint to Ban Web Fast Lanes Dallas Morning News, January 7, 2015Title II for Internet providers is all but confirmed by FCC chairman Ars Technica, January 7, 2015 On January 31, 2015, the Associated Press reported the FCC will present the notion of applying (\\"with some caveats\\") Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 to the Internet in a vote expected on February 26, 2015. Adoption of this notion would reclassify Internet service from one of information to one of telecommunications and, according to Wheeler, ensure US net neutrality. The FCC was expected to enforce net neutrality in its vote, according to the New York Times. On February 26, 2015, the FCC ruled in favor of net neutrality by applying Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and Section 706 of the Telecommunications act of 1996 to the Internet. Wheeler commented, \\"This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept.\\" On March 12, 2015, the FCC released the specific details of the net neutrality rules. On April 13, 2015, the FCC published the final rule on its new \\"Net Neutrality\\" regulations. Critics said that Wheeler was unduly influenced by Obama in changing his stance on net neutrality. In addition, journalists and advocates have expressed concern regarding the potential for inappropriate involvement by the White House over rule making at the FCC, which is supposed to be an independent agency. During a House Oversight Committee hearing in March 2015, Republicans disclosed that Wheeler had secretly met with top aides at the White House nine times while the new rules were being formulated. Wheeler responded that the new rules had not been discussed during the meetings. This prompted the committee chairman to state, \\"You meet with the White House multiple times ... and we're supposed to believe that one of the most important things the FCC has ever done, that this doesn't come up?\\" Bibliography *Wheeler, Tom, Take Command!: Leadership Lessons from the Civil War.

It was released by Data Age in 1983.  Plot  The player character has to \\"make his way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein,\\" where he \\"must prevent him from completing his creation.\\" The player must \\"gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where [he] must build a barricade around Frankenstein's monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive,\\" which he does using the so-called \\"Power Probe,\\" a device absorbing energy from an electrical storm.  Gameplay  The player must attempt to stop Frankenstein's monster from coming to life, by building walls around the monster. To do this, the player must retrieve bricks by crossing pits of acid and other obstacles. To fully imprison the monster (and thus, win the game), the player has to make a total of six trips to the lower part of the screen. With each successful trip, more obstacles are placed before the player, making the game more challenging. Contact with spiders and bats deducts points from the player's score. When the timer runs out or the player loses three lives, the monster breaks free and walks towards the screen, becoming larger, eventually taking up the entire screen. In two player mode, the players take turns and each player has their own timer. When one player falls into the acid pit, her timer pauses until it's his or her turn again and the other player's turn begins. This continues until one player loses three lives, at which point the game will be over.  Reception  In a 1983 review, Electronic Games wrote, \\"Very charming graphics and an interesting game concept,\\" and compared some elements of the game to Pitfall!. In 2013 The A.V.

The episodes were an adventure of a distorted reality where people were scheming ways to kill someone and try to get away with it. The killers had no sense of right or wrong and nothing would get in their way. Victims were usually killed by strangulation, knifing, or shooting. Killers devised cruel mind games such as tricking a wife into believing she was going insane, or manipulating a business associate into thinking he was being stalked by a lover who did not exist. Both of these elaborate plots were thought up to provide a scapegoat for the murderer. However, small details that they forgot to cover ultimately unraveled their evil plan at the end of each episode.Radio Horror Hosts: Dark Venture (2007) References American radio dramas Anthology radio series 1946 radio programme debuts 1947 radio programme endings 1940s American radio programs ","title":"Dark Venture"},{"id":"41275654","text":"Franciscus Jacobus \\"Frans\\" Luitjes (21 June 1944 – 27 October 1965) was a Dutch sprinter.

Conversely, the rejection of a sure thing in favor of a gamble of lower or equal expected value is known as risk-seeking behavior. The psychophysics of chance induce overweighting of sure things and of improbable events, relative to events of moderate probability. Underweighting of moderate and high probabilities relative to sure things contributes to risk aversion in the realm of gains by reducing the attractiveness of positive gambles. The same effect also contributes to risk seeking in losses by attenuating the aversiveness of negative gambles. Low probabilities, however, are overweighted, which reverses the pattern described above: low probabilities enhance the value of long-shots and amplify aversion to a small chance of a severe loss. Consequently, people are often risk seeking in dealing with improbable gains and risk averse in dealing with unlikely losses. Related theories Most theoretical analyses of risky choices depict each option as a gamble that can yield various outcomes with different probabilities. Widely accepted risk-aversion theories, including Expected Utility Theory (EUT) and Prospect Theory (PT), arrive at risk aversion only indirectly, as a side effect of how outcomes are valued or how probabilities are judged. In these analyses, a value function indexes the attractiveness of varying outcomes, a weighting function quantifies the impact of probabilities, and value and weight are combined to establish a utility for each course of action. This last step, combining the weight and value in a meaningful way to make a decision, remains sub-optimal in EUT and PT, as people's psychological assessments of risk do not match objective assessments. Expected utility theory Expected Utility Theory (EUT) poses a utility calculation linearly combining weights and values of the probabilities associated with various outcomes. By presuming that decision-makers themselves incorporate an accurate weighting of probabilities into calculating expected values for their decision-making, EUT assumes that people's subjective probability-weighting matches objective probability differences, when they are, in reality, exceedingly disparate. Consider the choice between a prospect that offers an 85% chance to win $1000 (with a 15% chance to win nothing) and the alternative of receiving $800 for sure. A large majority of people prefer the sure thing over the gamble, although the gamble has higher (mathematical) expected value (also known as expectation). The expected value of a monetary gamble is a weighted average, in which each possible outcome is weighted by its probability of occurrence. The expected value of the gamble in this example is .85 X $1000 + .15 X $0 = $850, which exceeds the expected value of $800 associated with the sure thing. Research suggests that people do not evaluate prospects by the expected value of their monetary outcomes, but rather by the expected value of the subjective value of these outcomes (see also Expected utility). In most real-life situations, the probabilities associated with each outcome are not specified by the situation, but have to be subjectively estimated by the decision-maker. The subjective value of a gamble is again a weighted average, but now it is the subjective value of each outcome that is weighted by its probability. To explain risk aversion within this framework, Bernoulli proposed that subjective value, or utility, is a concave function of money. In such a function, the difference between the utilities of $200 and $100, for example, is greater than the utility difference between $1,200 and $1,100. It follows from concavity that the subjective value attached to a gain of $800 is more than 80% of the value of a gain of $1,000. Consequently, the concavity of the utility function entails a risk averse preference for a sure gain of $800 over an 80% chance to win $1,000, although the two prospects have the same monetary expected value. While EUT has dominated the analysis of decision-making under risk and has generally been accepted as a normative model of rational choice (telling us how we should make decisions), descriptive models of how people actually behave deviate significantly from this normative model. Prospect theory and gain-loss asymmetry (S-shaped value function) Prospect Theory (PT) claims that fair gambles (gambles in which the expected value of the current option and all other alternatives are held equal) are unattractive on the gain side but attractive on the loss side. In contrast to EUT, PT is posited as an alternative theory of choice, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets (total wealth), and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. In an effort to capture inconsistencies in our preferences, PT offers a non-linear, S-shaped probability-weighted value function, implying that the decision-maker transforms probabilities along a diminishing sensitivity curve, in which the impact of a given change in probability diminishes with its distance from impossibility and certainty. The value function shown is: Predicted utility curve of prospect theory A. Defined on gains and losses rather than on total wealth. Prospects are coded as gains and losses from a zero point (e.g. using current wealth, rather than total wealth as a reference point), leading people to be risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses. B. Concave in the domain of gains (risk aversion) and convex in the domain of losses (risk seeking). The negatively accelerated nature of the function implies that people are risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses. C. Considerably steeper for losses than for gains (see also loss aversion). Steepness of the utility function in the negative direction (for losses over gains) explains why people are risk-averse even for gambles with positive expected values. While risk aversion is not part of PT per se, a pertinent part of PT is gain- loss asymmetry with regard to risk. PT's S-shaped probability-weighted, non- linear value function deems risk aversion context-dependent, as the gain-loss asymmetry illustrated above, results from our psychological assessments of risk hardly matching objective assessments of risk. One conceivable component of risk aversion in the framework of PT is that the degree of risk aversion apparent will vary depending on where along the curve our decision lies. Example: Participants are indifferent between receiving a lottery ticket offering a 1% chance at $200 and receiving $10 for sure. Additionally, people are indifferent between receiving a lottery ticket offering a 99% chance at $200 and receiving $188 for sure. In line with diminishing sensitivity, the first hundredth of probability is worth $10, and the last hundredth is worth $12, but the 98 intermediate hundredths are worth only $178, or about $1.80 per hundredth. PT captures this pattern of differentially weighting (objective) probabilities subjectively with an S-shaped weighting function. Framing effects A framing effect occurs when transparently and objectively identical situations generate dramatically different decisions depending on whether the situations are presented or perceived as either potential losses or gains. Framing effects play an integral role in risk-aversion, as an extension of PT's S-shaped value function, which illustrates the differences in how gains and losses are valued relative to a reference point. Risky prospects are characterized by their possible outcomes and by the probabilities of these outcomes. The same, possible outcomes of a gamble can be framed either as gains or as losses relative to the status quo. The following pair of problems attests to the power of framing effects in manipulating either risk-averse or risk-seeking behavior. The total number of respondents in each problem is denoted by N, and the percentage who chose each option is indicated in parentheses. > Problem 1 (N = 152): Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of > an unusual disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative > programs to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume that the exact > scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs are as follows: > If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. (72%) > If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability that 600 people > will be saved and a two-thirds probability that no people will be saved. > (28%) > Which of the two programs would you favor?. The formulation of Problem 1 implicitly adopts as a reference point a state of affairs in which the disease is allowed to take its toll of 600 lives. The outcomes of the programs include the reference state and two possible gains, measured by the number of lives saved. As expected, preferences are risk averse: a clear majority of respondents prefer saving 200 lives for sure over a gamble that offers a one-third chance of saving 600 lives. Now consider another problem in which the same cover story is followed by a different description of the prospects associated with the two programs: > Problem 2 (N = 155): Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of > an unusual disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative > programs to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume that the exact > scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs are as follows: > If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die. (22%) > If Program D is adopted, there is a one-third probability that nobody will > die and a two-thirds probability that 600 people will die. (78%) It is easy to verify that options C and D in Problem 2 are indistinguishable in real terms from options A and B in Problem 1, respectively. The second version, however, assumes a reference state in which no one dies of the disease. The best outcome is the maintenance of this state and the alternatives are losses measured by the number of people that will die of the disease. People who evaluate options in these terms are expected to show a risk-seeking preference for the gamble (option D) over the sure loss of 400 lives. Of course, the “sure loss” of 400 lives that participants found so unattractive is exactly the same outcome as the “sure gain” of 200 subjects found so attractive in the Problem 1. The public health problem illustrates a formulation effect in which a change of wording from \\"lives saved\\" to \\"lives lost\\" induced a marked shift of preference from risk aversion to risk seeking. If preferences reverse based on inconsequential aspects of how the problem is framed, people cannot possibly be maximizing expected utility. Latent here is the unsettling idea that people’s preferences come from the outside (from whomever has the power to shape the environment and determine how questions are phrased), rather than from their own psychological makeup. Decision-making in matters as important as lives saved or lives lost can reverse risk preference. This may be based on a rephrasing of the outcomes that conveys no differential information about the treatments and that changes nothing about the outcomes themselves. Phenomena While risk aversion is commonly explained through EUT and PT, observed risk-aversion behavior remains solely an artifact of these two theories, and extends beyond the bounds of what each theory can explain. Direct risk aversion Both EUT and PT make the following falsifiable prediction: an individual cannot be so risk averse as to value a risky prospect less than the prospect’s worst possible outcome. On the contrary, several between-participant studies have found that people are willing to pay less, on average, for a binary lottery than for its worse outcome, a finding coined the uncertainty effect (UE). For example, people are willing to pay an average of $26 for a $50 gift certificate, but only $16 for a lottery that pays either a $50 or $100 gift certificate, with equal probability. UE, valuing a risky prospect below the value of its worse possible outcome, occurs as the result of a phenomenon known as direct risk aversion, a literal distaste for uncertainty, as uncertainty itself enters directly into people’s utility function. =Societal applications= EUT and PT predict that people should not purchase insurance for small-stakes risks, yet such forms of insurance (e.g., electronic warranties, insurance policies with low deductibles, mail insurance, etc.) are very popular. Direct risk aversion may explain why, as people demonstrate their literal distaste for any and all levels of uncertainty. By paying a premium (often higher than the cost of replacement) for the possibility that insurance may come in handy, people display direct risk aversion by valuing a risky prospect below the value of its worst possible outcome (replacement at face-value). Suppose you are undecided whether or not to purchase earthquake insurance because the premium is quite high. As you hesitate, your friendly insurance agent comes forth with an alternative offer: \\"For half the regular premium you can be fully covered if the quake occurs on an odd day of the month. This is a good deal because for half the price you are covered for more than half the days.\\" Why do most people find such probabilistic insurance distinctly unattractive? Starting anywhere in the region of low probabilities, the impact on the decision weight of a reduction of probability from p to p/2 is considerably smaller than the effect of a reduction from p/2 to 0. Reducing the risk by half, then, is not worth half the premium. The aversion to probabilistic insurance is significant for three reasons. First, it undermines the classical explanation of insurance in terms of a concave utility function. According to EUT, probabilistic insurance should be definitely preferred to normal insurance when the latter is just acceptable. Second, probabilistic insurance represents many forms of protective action, such as having a medical checkup, buying new tires, or installing a burglar alarm system. Such actions typically reduce the probability of some hazard without eliminating it altogether. Third, the acceptability of insurance can be manipulated by the framing of the contingencies. An insurance policy that covers fire but not flood, for example, could be evaluated either as full protection against a specific risk, (e.g., fire) or as a reduction in the overall probability of property loss. People greatly undervalue a reduction in the probability of a hazard in comparison to the complete elimination of that hazard. Hence, insurance should appear more attractive when it is framed as the elimination of risk than when it is described as a reduction of risk. Further, Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1982) showed that a hypothetical vaccine that reduces the probability of contracting a disease from 20% to 10% is less attractive if it is described as effective in half of the cases than if it is presented as fully effective against one of two exclusive and equally probable virus strains that produce identical symptoms. Affective psychology of risk The earliest studies of risk perception also found that, whereas risk and benefit tend to be positively correlated in the world, they are negatively correlated in people’s minds, and, therefore, judgments. The significance of this finding was not realized until a study by Alhakami and Slovic (1994) found that the inverse relation between perceived risk and perceived benefit of an activity (e.g., using pesticides) was linked to the strength of positive or negative affect associated with that activity as measured by rating the activity on bipolar scales such as good/bad, nice/awful, dread/not dread, and so forth. This result implies that people base their judgments of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it but also on how they feel about it. If their feelings toward an activity are favorable, they are moved toward judging the risks as low and the benefits as high; if their feelings toward it are unfavorable, they tend to judge the opposite— high risk and low benefit (see also affect heuristic). Both EUT and PT are probability-outcome independent theories, as they posit separate functions for the evaluation of outcomes and probabilities. Both assume that the impact of a given probability is a function of that probability but not of the outcome to which it’s attached. Further, neither theory distinguishes one source of value from another. While probability-outcome independence may hold across outcomes of different monetary values, it is unlikely to hold across outcomes of varying affects. =Realm of gains= In 2001, two researchers from the University of Chicago, Rottenstreich and Hsee, conducted a series of three experiments to illustrate probability-outcome dependence, using an affective approach. Experiment 1: In an experiment observing probability-outcome interactions, a lottery ticket offers you a chance to meet and kiss your favorite movie-star as a prize (affect-rich) or $50 in cash (affect-poor). Each of the two conditions poses a 1% probability of the respective gamble occurring. Results & Implications: 70% of participants preferred the cash to the kiss under certainty, whereas 65% (nearly the reverse) preferred the kiss to the cash under low probability. This indicates that we weight what should be an objectively equal 1% probability in each scenario differently: a 1% probability is greater for the affect-rich kiss than for the affect-poor cash. Experiment 2: In a subsequent, and more realistic study, two similar and financially equivalent prizes - a $500 coupon redeemable toward payments associated with a European vacation (affect-rich) and a $500 coupon redeemable toward payment of tuition (affect-poor) were presented. For each prize, some participants were told they had a 1% chance of winning, and others a 99% chance of winning. Participants then had to indicate how much money they would have to be offered for them to be indifferent between receiving that dollar amount for sure and having the specified chance of winning the prize. Results & Implications: Although the two coupons had equivalent redemption values, the median price of the 1% chance of winning the European vacation was $20, but $5 for the tuition coupon, indicating that the weight of 1% we place on affect- rich prizes is greater than for affect-poor prizes. Based on results from the 1% condition, PT would predict that at a 99% chance of winning, the European coupon would still be priced higher than the tuition coupon. On the contrary, the affective approach found that in the 99% chance of winning condition, the median price of the European coupon was $450, whereas that of the tuition coupon was $478. Our weighting of the 99% probability as smaller for the affect-rich European coupon than the affect-poor tuition coupon indicates probability-outcome dependence for affect-rich outcomes. Affect-rich outcomes yield more pronounced overweighting of small probabilities, but more pronounced underweighting of large probabilities. Both examples indicate probability-outcome dependence, as based on affect-rich outcomes, which changes the shape of PT’s S-shaped curve. In Experiment 2, the size of the affect-rich jump in the weighting function is much greater ($500 – $450 = $50) than the size of the affect-poor jump ($500 – $478 = $22). Thus, weighting functions will be more S-shaped for lotteries involving affect-rich than affect-poor outcomes. That is, people will be more sensitive to departures from impossibility and certainty (from hope and fear), but less sensitive to intermediate probability variations for affect-rich outcomes, resulting in larger jumps at the endpoints of the weighting function. Results from this study suggest that the assumption of probability-outcome independence adopted by both EUT and PT may hold across outcomes of different monetary values, but not different affective values. =Realm of losses= The outcomes studies in Experiments 1 and 2 were gains above the status quo. When a positive outcome is available, any departure from impossibility may engender hope (affect-rich and positive), and any deviation from certainty may produce fear (affect-rich but negative). The following study demonstrates that the opposite pattern is also true: when the available outcome is negative, departures from impossibility engender fear, and deviations from certainty produce hope. Experiment 3: Participants were told to imagine themselves in a hypothetical experiment entailing either a certain, 1% or 99% chance of a short, painful but not dangerous electric shock (affect-rich), and others were told that the experiment entailed either a 1% or 99% chance of a cash penalty (affect-poor, relatively). They were then asked to indicate how much money they would have to pay for them to be indifferent between paying that amount for sure and participating in the hypothetical experiment. Certainty condition: The median price paid to avoid an electric shock was $19.86. Most participants (24/30) preferred receiving the shock over paying more than $20. Low-probability condition: The median price paid to avoid a 1% chance of a shock was $7, substantially greater than the median price paid to avoid a 1% chance of a $20 penalty. As before, the weight of a 1% probability is greater for the affect- rich shock than for the affect-poor cash payment. High-probability condition: The median price paid to avoid a 99% chance of shock, $10, was substantially lower than the median price paid to avoid a 99% chance of cash penalty, $18. Results: Taken together, for the affect-rich electric shock, the size of the right-hand jump in the weighting function is about $10 ($19.86 - $10), but for the affect-poor cash penalty, the size of this jump is much smaller at $2 ($20 - $18). Again, we see that the weight of the 99% is smaller for the affect- rich shock than for the affect-poor cash.'' Both Experiments 1 and 2 investigated outcomes that were gains over the status quo. Experiment 3 studied negative outcomes and also found evidence of a weighting function that is more S-shaped for affect-rich that affect-poor prizes. Therefore, probability-outcome dependence based on the affect-rich psychology of risk applies in the domains of both gains and losses. Neuropsychology of risk aversion Negativity bias Do you remember the worst thing that has happened to you? What about the best? At what frequency are you able to recall memories that are negative in comparison to those that are positive? Does it seem like negative information is remembered with more ease and clarity than positive information? Why is it easier to know the percentage of fatal car accidents each year, as opposed to the percentage of accidents without fatalities? The human brain demonstrates a partiality for the processing of negative information. In comparison with their positive counterparts, negative stimuli receive a larger allocation of attention and a swifter response once recognized by the brain. This bias for negative information occurs very early on in the stages of processing, seen in the appearance of a P1, a component of the event-related potentials (ERP) gathered from an EEG (electroencephalography) output. Researchers localized this particular ERP to the ventrolateral occipital cortex. Given that a greater amount of attention is allotted to the processing of negative stimuli, the negativity bias may also be indicative of an attentional bias. The negativity bias is noticeable in a plethora of situations related to the formation of risk-averse behaviour. Notably, any stimuli that evokes the expression of fear encourages risk -aversion. The human brain has adapted to easily parse out these stimuli from a sea of benign stimuli. In the laboratory, participants report and respond more quickly to negative stimuli; Photos of negative and threatening pictures jump out of an array of photos, capturing participants’ attention more than positive or neutral pictures. Non-tangibles, such as personality traits, also demonstrate a similar impact for eliciting risk-averse behaviour. Carleston & Skowronski (1989) found that negative traits form a stronger impression on an individual than positive traits, thus affecting the overall impression of the individual being evaluated. Emotion and decision making An individual’s affect often determines the extent to which one’s behaviour is effective in obtaining their goal. Decision making and emotion, intertwined, cannot be separated from each other, as emotion can either benefit or hinder the attainment of maximized utility. =Influence of emotion on decision making= Three different emotional states influence decision making: Your current emotional state (i.e. How do you feel while you are making a decision?) Your past emotional state (i.e. How did you feel anticipating your decision?) Your future emotional state (i.e. How will your decision affect how you feel in the future; What effect will the decision have on your emotional well-being?) =Iowa gambling task= Researching decision-making and affect, Antoine Bechara, Antonio Damasio and colleagues (2000; 2005) discovered that damage to a brain area associated with emotional processing impairs effective decision-making. After discovering that damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impaired participants from making goal-oriented decisions in social and professional contexts, Damasio and his colleagues designed the Iowa Gambling Task. In creating this task, Damasio wondered whether decision- making was afflicted because emotion was a necessary component to making effective decisions. In the task, participants continuously draw from one out of four possible decks – participants may switch decks at any point during the study. Each card possesses monetary value, resulting in either gains or losses. Participants are unaware that 2 of the decks correspond to net winnings – low payoffs and even lower losses. The other 2 decks correspond to net losses – high payoffs and even higher losses. Researchers instruct participants to maximize their utility – gain the most money by the end of the task. In order to complete this task successfully, participants must discern that the decks associated with net winning, yet low payoffs, maximize their utility.'' Results. Damasio noticed that participants with damage to their orbitofrontal cortex were unable to realize that the deck associated with low payoffs yielded higher reward. From his discovery using the Iowa Gambling Task, Damasio formulated a Somatic marker hypothesis. Alternate Conclusions. Other researchers suggest that the difficulty encountered by patients with orbitofrontal cortex damage on Iowa Gambling Task is because the task requires participants to change their initial perception of potential gains and losses. Participants are lured in by appealing rewards, then confronted with devastating losses. Thus, orbitofrontal cortex damage inhibits the adaptation to changing patterns of rewards and punishment. This conclusion has been replicated in primates, where orbitofrontal damage prevented the extinction of a learned association. =Somatic marker theory= Damasio posited that emotional information in the form of physiological arousal, is needed to inform decision making. When confronted with a decision, we may react emotionally to the situation, a reaction that manifests as changes in physiological arousal in the body, or somatic markers. Given data collected from the Iowa Gambling Task, Damasio postulated that the orbitofrontal cortex assists individuals in forming an association between somatic markers and the situations that trigger them. Once an association is made, the orbitofrontal cortex and other brain areas evaluate an individual's previous experiences eliciting similar somatic markers. Once recognized, the orbitofrontal cortex can determine an adequate and swift behavioural response, and its likeliness for reward. Neuroscience of risk aversion =Regret and risk aversion= Several brain areas are observed in the expression of risk-averse behaviour. The previously mentioned orbitofrontal cortex is amongst these brain areas, supporting the feeling of regret. Regret, an emotion which heavily influences decision making, leads individuals to make decisions which circumvent encountering this emotion in the future. Studying brain activity associated with regret, researcher Georgio Coricelli and his colleagues (2005) triggered feelings of regret in healthy participants, by having them complete a gambling task in which they were informed that the best choice was the unchosen option. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Coricelli found that increasing regret correlated with increased activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the anterior hippocampus. The higher the activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, the greater the reported regret. After repeated trials, researchers began to observe risk averse behaviour by their participants, a behaviour echoed in intensified activity within the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala. =Brain areas of risk aversion= Risk-averse behaviors are the culmination of several neural correlates. While avoiding negative stimuli, perceived or real, is a simple enough action, it requires anticipation, motivation and reasoning. How do you know a stimulus is malevolent? What information leads you to ultimately behave in a manner consistent with ensuring or endangering your well-being? Each of these questions recruit a different brain area, playing a poignant role in whether a decision is beneficial to an individual. Fear-Conditioning. Over time, individuals learn that a stimulus is not benign through personal experience. Implicitly, a fear of a particular stimulus can develop, resulting in risk-averse behaviour. Traditionally, fear-conditioning is not associated with decision-making, but rather the pairing of a neutral stimulus with an aversive situation. Once an association is formed between the neutral stimulus and aversive event, a startle response is observed each time the neutral stimulus is presented. An aversion to the presentation of the neutral stimulus is observed after repeated trials. Essential to understanding risk aversion is the implicit learning that occurs during fear-conditioning. Risk aversion is the culmination of implicitly or explicitly acquired knowledge that informs an individual that a particular situation is aversive to their psychological well-being. Similarly, fear-conditioning is the acquisition of knowledge that informs an individual that a particular neutral stimulus now predicts an event that endangers their psychological or physical well-being. Researchers such as Mike Davis (1992) and Joseph LeDoux (1996), have deciphered the neural correlates responsible for the acquisition of fear- conditioning. The amygdala, previously mentioned as a region showing high activity for the emotion of regret, is the central recipient for brain activity concerning fear-conditioning. Several streams of information from multiple brain areas converge on the lateral amygdala, allowing for the creation of associations that regulate fear-conditioning; Cells in the superior dorsal lateral amygdala are able to rapidly pair the neutral stimulus with the aversive stimulus. Cells that project from the lateral amygdala to the central amygdala allow for the initiation of an emotional response if a stimulus is deemed threatening. Cognitive Control. Evaluating a gamble and calculating its expected value requires a certain amount of cognitive control. Several brain areas are dedicated to monitoring the congruence between expected and actual outcomes. Evidence by Ridderinkhof et al. (2004) suggests that the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) are involved in goal-directed performance monitoring and behaviour modulation. The pMPC monitors response conflicts (any situation that activates more than one response tendency), decision uncertainty, and any deviation from the anticipated outcome. Activation in the pMPC increases significantly after an error, response conflict, or unfavorable outcome is detected. As a result, the pMFC can signal a need for performance adjustment; there is a lack of evidence, however, indicating that the pMFC controls modulatory behaviour. Behaviour control processes in the LPFC have been implicated in the modulatory behaviour observed by researchers. Summary The field of neuroeconomics is emerging as a unified branch of knowledge, intending to merge information from psychology, economics and neuroscience with hopes of better understanding human behaviour. Risk aversion poses a mystifying question that intrigues experts in all three disciplines. Why is it that humans do not act in accord with their anticipated outcome? Whilst negative outcomes retain more value than positive outcome, human beings do not make logical decisions. Parsing out emotion and fear of loss from decision making would result in more implementation of mathematical calculations, thus maximizing expected utility. While activation in specific brain areas can highlight the mechanisms of decision making, evidence continues to support the prevalence of risk-averse behaviour.

He also served as a politician in South Australia in both houses of Parliament. Born in Edinburgh, as a young married man he emigrated with his family to Australia in 1855, following friends who had traveled there some years before because of the colony's opportunities. History John Patrick Darling (23 February 1831 – 10 April 1905) was born in Edinburgh, the second son of John Darling of Duns and his wife, who were a family of modest means. He was educated at George Heriot's School. His father died when he was 10, and the boy was forced to leave school at the age of 11 to help support his family. His first job was as an office boy at the printing shop of Balfour & Jack, but he lost that job after 6 or 8 weeks. He next worked at Duncan Sinclair and Sons' type foundry, \\"Whitford House\\"; then at Alexander Wilson & Son. Lastly he was employed at James Marr, Gallie, & Co., where he worked for about 12 years. He married Isabella Ferguson, and they had two sons, including John Darling Jr.). Several of his friends, including Alexander Dowie and Joseph Ferguson, emigrated to South Australia in 1851. Over the years there, Dowie built a bootmaking and tannery business, and Ferguson became an owner of The Register in Adelaide. Realizing the lack of opportunities for advancement in Edinburgh, Darling decided to follow them. He was not a wealthy man, and did not qualify for assisted passage, so it took some time before he could arrange to emigrate with his family. Business Early in 1855, he and his family sailed from Leith on the Isabella, landing at Semaphore, South Australia. Four days later he was working in the Berry & Gall store in Rundle Street, Adelaide. Although this job did not last long, he soon found work with baker Robert Birrell of Grenfell street. He worked there for two years. Darling left to work as a carter and, at the same time, helped his wife set up a store adjacent to the Stag Inn on Rundle Street. They tried again with a shop, \\"Millbrook Store\\", on Glen Osmond Road, which slowly became profitable. His life changed after Darling was recruited by James Smith, of Giles & Smith, Waymouth street, who had a flour mill on West Terrace. While working with Giles & Smith for five years, Darling learned the wheat and flour business. He resigned from the firm and by 1865 was trading independently. In 1867 he took over sole management of the grain stores in Waymouth Street, previously owned by R. G. Bowen. John Darling Jr., began to work with him, and in 1872 was made a partner in the business, thereafter known as J. Darling & Son, millers, grain, and general merchants. For 30 years the business grew steadily. Known as the \\"Grain King,\\" Darling set up branches throughout South Australia's wheat belt. First he bought up flour mills, then established brokerage agencies in Melbourne in 1880 and London. His company grew to handle most of Australia's export grain. Darling retired from the business in October 1897, leaving John Darling, Jr as sole proprietor. Politics Darling became involved in politics by March 1870. With Patrick \\"Paddy\\" Coglin, he was elected for the House of Assembly seat of the West Adelaide district. That parliament lasted little more than a year. Darling did not stand for re- election, choosing instead to travel overseas on business. But he was re- elected from West Adelaide, serving from 21 June 1876 to 15 April 1878. In 1878 he was returned for the Yatala, but retired in 1880. He did not re-enter Parliament till May 1885, after winning the seat of Stanley. In May 1887 he was elected as a representative of the Northern District in the Legislative Council. For ten years he continued to be elected to the Upper House. In June 1885, he accepted the portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works in Sir John Downer's Ministry, but he retired from Government in October of the same year. :\\"He played a useful and an honorable part in the politics of the State, and he was remembered as a prudent, sagacious legislator. He held his opinions strongly, and was not swayed from his convictions by the desire for applause or popularity. ... He knew his mind, and did not waver, doing solid, conscientious work, supporting in particular the interests of the agriculturists, with whose requirements he made himself thoroughly conversant. His sound judgment and the wide knowledge he had gained of South Australia as a leading man of business, earned him the respect and confidence both of his legislative colleagues and the public. It has well been said that though he was not a frequent speaker in Parliament, his utterances' always carried weight. ... On Select Committees and Royal Commissions he did a great deal of quiet and unostentatious work, which has since benefited the country. The Commission on coal contracts and wharfingering, it may be mentioned, were appointed on his initiative.\\" Social and religious Darling was a member of the Adelaide Caledonian Society, and its Chief from 1892 to 1894. He became interested in cricket through his son Joseph (who captained Australia in 21 Test matches), and took a leading part in establishing the Adelaide Oval. Darling was a deacon of the Hindmarsh Square Congregational Church before joining the Flinders Street Baptist Church in 1865. There he served as Sunday school superintendent, and was an active member, serving as a lay preacher and on committees. . He was absent only while living two years in Melbourne, or when overseas on business, as he developed his export business in London. Darling helped found the City Mission Hall in Light Square, towards which he gave £500. Death Darling last attended church the day before he died, for the first service of a new pastor, Rev. James Mursell. Darling died of sudden heart failure at the family home \\"Thurloo\\" on Kent Terrace, Kent Town. This may have been the residence later known as \\"Darling House\\" at 64 Kent Terrace, Kent Town (now 64 Kensington Rd, Norwood). He left an estate worth £67,500. The two-storey house was acquired by the Salvation Army in 1929; they operated it as the \\"Kent Town Boys' Home\\" until 1972. It later was used by the S.A. AIDS Council as its headquarters. Family Darling married Isabella Ferguson, daughter of James and his wife, on 31 December 1850. They had seven sons and one daughter together: *John Darling, Jr. (24 January 1852 – 27 March 1914), married Jessie Dowie, eldest daughter of Darling's friend Alexander Dowie, on 14 October 1875.

In the United States, mandatory messages first appeared after the passage of the Federal Caustic Poisons Act (FCPA) of 1927, a law that ordered sellers of poisons to provide warning labels on their bottles. Prior to the passage of the FCPA, some sellers would use unusually shaped or colored bottles to signify the presence of a dangerous substance. After the Act, manufacturers mostly used plain bottles and displayed warning labels on them. The agency responsible for enforcing the regulations of the FCPA was the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Today, the FDA is the main body responsible for mandating disclaimers in the United States. Mandatory disclaimers are still used widely in the U.S. The imposition of mandatory disclaimers is an exception to the First Amendment that was allowed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Valentine v. Christensen (1942). The exception to the First Amendment applies to commercial speech, which the Court defined as speech that “proposes a commercial transaction.” Later cases have attempted to limit the extent of the “commercial speech\\" restriction on free speech, such as Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council (1976) and Florida Bar v. Went For It (1995). Voluntary disclaimers, however, have been used since the beginning of advertising. They lead to more persuasive advertising, and they provide useful information to consumers. Experimental studies suggest that mandatory disclaimers do not help buyers and may lead them to make inferior decisions.  References  * Green, Kesten C.; Armstrong, J.

The school has two campuses and three youth choirs of high international standard. Many professional musicians are alumni. This article is about the music school and its associated youth choirs. Adolf Fredrik's Youth Choir is part of the Adolf Fredrik Church and has only its name in common with the school. Adolf Fredriks Madrigalkör used to be associated with the church, but is now independent from both the church and the school.  History  Lilla (small) Adolf Fredrik's School Founding The school was founded in 1939 on the initiative of Hugo Hammarström (1891–1974) and offered the first music classes in Sweden, based on models such as King's College, Cambridge England, Die Städtische Singschule, Augsburg, Germany, and the Copenhagen Boys Choir in Denmark. The purpose was to give musically inclined pupils additional training in singing, sight-reading, choral singing and more. Hammarström continued his work at the music school until 1957. The AF fight In 1982–83, the school was the focus of a heated controversy, AF-striden (literally The AF fight), between those who felt that special classes of any kind and Adolf Fredrik's Music School in particular represent an \\"elitist\\" approach, and those who felt that all students have a right to develop their abilities as far as possible. One factor that inflamed the battle was a study of similar music classes in Norrköping, where it could be shown that the pupils' parents mostly, but not exclusively, had high status occupations. The Swedish Nobel Prize laureate, sociologist and politician Alva Myrdal took a strong stance on the issue in an interview in Svenska Dagbladet by Mats Johansson on July 14, 1983. On September 17, 1983, she published a letter in the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter where she explained that the goal of the Swedish school system, equal schooling to all, means that all pupils should be encouraged to develop their abilities. She also warned against repression of special abilities under the guise of elitism. This effectively ended the controversy. Name and location The name of the school has changed several times and the premises have also changed. Stockholms musikklasser (Stockholm's music classes) is still used to describe the same school, and before 1960 the school was called Stockholm's singing classes. Adolf Fredrik is the name of the Swedish King who lived 1710 – 1771. The school has mostly been housed in the present city campus location, but periodically there have also been branch operations in Mariaskolan, Eriksdalsskolan, Vasa Real and finally the Swedish National Defence College's old premises at Valhallavägen. Second campus On December 13, 2013, it was announced by the municipal school authorities in Stockholm that because of the extreme popularity and low admissions rate of the existing Adolf Fredrik's Music School a second Music School campus with the same orientation would open in 2015. The new campus opened in the fall of 2015.  Buildings  City campus City campus On the site of the present buildings, roughly at the intersection Dalagatan/Rådmansgatan, a windmill called Nya Rörstrandskvarnen and nicknamed Stora Tisan was constructed sometime between 1747 and 1751. The windmill was in use until the 1880s when it was moved elsewhere. The main building of the City campus with street address Tegnérgatan 44-46 in Stockholm has housed various school forms over the years. From 1939 Stockholm's music classes has concentrated the major part of its activities to the building that is presently named Adolf Fredrik's Music School, a name that may thus refer both to the institution with two campuses and to the City campus building. The main building was erected in 1907–10 as a folkskola (people's school), originally for a capacity of 2,360 pupils, based on drawings by architect Georg A. Nilsson. The main building (see the first photo) is the base of Stockholms musikklasser (Stockholm's music classes) that was previously housed in other buildings, and the two names are used without distinction in daily conversation. There is also a smaller building (see the second photo) on the same site, built 1907–10, architect Hagström & Ekman. This building formerly housed Åhlinska skolan and is now used for younger children without a specific music curriculum. Farsta campus Southwest facade of Farsta campus The Farsta campus with street address Farstavägen 118 in Farsta, a district of Farsta borough south of Stockholm, has had different names over the years. The white building, designed by architect Lennart Brundin, was finished in 1963 and was originally named Farsta läroverk (English: Farsta grammar school). The name was changed to Farsta gymnasium (English: Farsta high school) in 1967. From 2015 the name is Farsta grundskola (English: Farsta primary school). The buildings will be renovated at a cost of about SEK 150 million, with work to be finished in the fall of 2017. The main lecture hall will also function as a concert hall with 500 seats. In contrast with the City campus the Farsta campus will have music classes mixed with normal classes in grades 0-9. When at full capacity in 2019 the campus will house a total of 1,160 students whereof 360 in music classes.  Academics  Adolf Fredrik's Music School is a niche school, with heavy emphasis on music and choral singing, but without sacrificing academic rigor in other subjects. Admission to the school is based on audition in singing and musical ability before starting fourth grade, and admission is competitive with an acceptance rate of around 15%. 240 students are admitted annually, 180 for the City campus and 60 and for the Farsta campus, and attend the school from 4th to 9th grade. Two-thirds of the admitted students are girls. Over 1,000 students attend the City campus and when fully established the Farsta campus will have over 350 students. For the academic year 2013–2014 the school ranked number seven in Sweden for junior high school grade point average. The twice-annual school newspaper Lyran was started in 1963, making it the oldest school newspaper in Sweden, according to the Swedish Patent and Registration Office.  Music  Adolf Fredrik's Girls Choir Each student belongs to a class-choir consisting of 30 to 60 students. Practices are held almost every school day, and each class-choir has a substantial concert program schedule (at churches and auditoriums and other venues). Additionally, the school has three official choirs, which represent the school in concerts and competitions: Adolf Fredrik's Girls Choir, Boys Choir, and the mixed Chamber Choir. Membership in these choirs is based on auditions, held amongst the school's students. Students at the school will have sung in class choirs (often a cappella) for 1200 hours by the time they graduate at age 16. (Those who participate in one of the school's competitive representation choirs and continue to a high school which also has emphasis in music, may accumulate 2000 hours of singing before university.) This training takes place during the students' most formative years. After graduating from the school, some students continue on to one of three high schools in Stockholm with heavy emphasis on music: Kungsholmens Musikgymnasium with mixed academic/choral singing emphasis, Södra Latin with mixed academic/individual musicianship emphasis, or Lilla Akademien with a heavy emhasis on fostering future professional musicians. Adolf Fredrik's Boys Choir Cooperation In 1959 Stockholms Musikgymnasium (Stockholm's Music High School) for 10th through 12th grade started its activity in Adolf Fredrik's Music School. In 1984 it moved to Kungsholmens gymnasium. Collaboration between the two schools continues and is manifested in annual concerts in the Globen arena, Friends Arena or other suitable venues with high spectator capacity. Students from Adolf Fredrik's Music School regularly participate in opera performances at the Royal Opera Stockholm, such as when children's voices are required in operas like Bizet's Carmen. Grammophone recordings featuring Adolf Fredrik's Music School choirs have been nominated for the Grammis Award (the Swedish equivalent to the Grammy Award in 1990, 2009 and 2013. The web pages of Adolf Fredrik's Girls and Adolf Fredrik's Boys Choir list 16 and 4 cd disc recordings respectively. Choral Festivals – Let the Future Sing In 2009 the Music School celebrated its 70th anniversary by hosting a children and youth choral festival, Adolf Fredrik Choral Festival, with participating choirs from several countries. The festival, also known as Let the Future Sing, was held again in 2012 with around 300 singers from Armenia, Estonia, Canada, China, USA and South Africa as well as around 1,000 Swedish singers. The third festival was held in 2015 with a total of 1,400 young choral singers, including choirs from Bulgaria, Finland, the Philippines, Russia, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. Parental involvement Parents are very important for the school's continued success. First, there is for all practical purposes mandatory parent participation in class based working groups for concerts, class excursions and other tasks. Parents of each class are assigned to one of six groups for one year at a time, so that by the time the student finishes his or her studies each parent has participated in each of the six working groups. Second, the Parent Teacher Organization (AFFF – Adolf Fredriks Föräldraförening) is very active in different ways to promote the school and enhance its academic and musical curriculum. During the AF fight referred to above AFFF played a very important lobbying role (see external links). Third, Föreningen Adolf Fredriks Musikklasser () works to promote child and youth choirs locally, nationally and internationally (see external links).  Student government  The student body is represented by the Adolf Fredrik's Music School Student council (), that serves the student body by promoting extracurricular activities and by providing a voice to the student body in all discussion of school policy with the administration. The Student council applies voluntary membership, is student-driven, democratic, and has equal voting rights for all members. It consists of Class councils, Team councils and a Council board. The Team councils are each headed by a President aided by a Secretary, elected at the first meeting of the new school year. When Team councils meet every other Tuesday a teacher from the team also participates. Every President of a Team council is also a member of the Council Board, that elects a Chairman and a Secretary. The Council Board meets every week in the Principal's office.  Reputation  A choir from the school won the BBC's \\"Let the people sing\\" choir competition and in 2001, and became a Choir of the European Federation and Cultural Ambassador\\". The school is mentioned as one of the building blocks of The Swedish Choral Miracle. Singers.com called the school \\"a distinguished institution of music well known throughout the world\\" and the Barbershop Harmony Society called it \\"the most renowned choir school in Sweden\\". Discogs said the school is \\"one of the most internationally recognized children's and youth choirs throughout the world.\\"  Wider influence  The Swedish Choral Miracle The school was the first Music School of its kind in Sweden and has inspired scores of similar schools around the country, forming one of the building blocks of The Swedish Choral Miracle (the term is a well-known expression in the world of choral music, ever since the book with the same name by Richard Sparks was published). Though Adolf Fredrik's Music School was the first of its kind its success had by 2008 led to the creation of classes with a focus on choral singing or instrumental music in addition to the normal academic curriculum in 70 schools around Sweden. At least 5% of the Swedish population are members of and sing in choirs weekly. In 1999 Per-Åke Byström and Bo Johansson published the Swedish language book Tidernas körklang : en bok om Adolf Fredriks musikklasser, Stockholms musikgymnasium och mycket annat about the choral sound and tradition of Adolf Fredrik's Music School and Stockholms Musikgymnasium. Barbershop Barbershop is a special case. There were as of 2013 only 8 male choruses, some 20 quartets and in total approximately 250 individuals throughout the Nordic countries combined who sing barbershop in a reasonably organized manner (i.e., belonging to a barbershop organization). The barbershop quartet Ringmasters became the first ever non-US International Champions in 2012, while Swedish barbershop quartets have become International Collegiate Quartet Champions in 2008, 2010 and 2012. The members of these championship winning groups have their musical roots in Adolf Fredrik's Music School and Kungsholmens Musikgymnasium. In 1989 Growing Girls from Stockholm suburb Rönninge was the first non-US female quartet to become Sweet Adelines International champions (called \\"Queens of Harmony\\"); all the quartet members attended Adolf Fredrik's Music School.

He is best known for his publications on post-traditional governance theory and practice – especially on macro public administration and public policy. He has also published on the philosophy and foundations of economics, on the metaphysics of time and on criminal justice policy and management. Post-traditional conceptual approaches analyzed in his writings include thinking as play, justice as seeking, practice as art, reflexive language, imaginization, anti-administration, deterritorialization, and epistemic pluralism. The contents of some of the books are indicated under their titles – including To Kill the King, The Language of Public Administration, Public Administration in Perspective, Being in Time, and Crime Control. The reference section lists these and others of his works. Dr. Farmer has also contributed to the fields of post-traditional governance theory and practice through many book chapters and articles.Resume.  Education and early life.  He began his university education at the London School of Economics, University of London. He obtained a master's degree in economics from the University of Toronto and a master's degree in philosophy at the University of Virginia. He was awarded two Ph.D. degrees. His Ph.D. in Economics is from the University of London (1984), and his Ph.D. in Philosophy is from the University of Virginia (1989). His father Joseph worked for most of his life in the Research and Development Department of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. His father's influence included not only interest in the Brabazon Airplane, but also playing Chess and participating in discussion groups. His mother, Gladys, died when he was three years old. Farmer's interests in his pre-teen years included reading about basic Archaeology and Astronomy, playing Chess, and school.  Career  Farmer's academic appointments at Virginia Commonwealth University included being Professor of Philosophy and Public Affairs (2003-2015); Professor of Political Science and Public Administration (1994-2003); Professor of Public Administration (1986-1994); Professor of Administration of Justice and Public Safety (1980-1991), including 1982-1991 as Chair; and Affiliate Professor of Philosophy (1992-2003). The main achievement has been the development and application of post-traditional analysis, as explained in The Language of Public Administration, To Kill the King, and Public Administration in Practice and in such concepts as thinking as play, ethics as seeking, practice as art, deconstruction, epistemic pluralism, neuro-gov., un-engineering, anti- administration, the practicality of poetry, and the allure of rhetoric. His practitioner experience included being Division Director, National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice (1974-1980); Director of Operations Management and Special Assistant to the Police Commissioner, New York City Police Department (1971-1974); Management Consultant at The Jacobs Company, Planning Research Corporation (1970-1971); Management Consultant, Public Administration Service (1965-1970); Chief, Methods Research and other positions, Ontario Provincial Government (1962-1965); and Administrative Analyst, Budget Bureau, Saskatchewan Government, 1960-1961. Farmer was Director of the Police Division at the Federal Government's National Institute of Justice (within the U.S. Department of Justice and until 1978 named National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice), and he had a staff of some five people. His main function was to recommend the expenditure of research grants to help upgrade policing. The police research budget was approximately $3 million to spend in the first year: using the consumer price index, that is said to be $15,358,766 in today's dollars. His work included what he discussed in articles and talks about what was called the possibility of a Research Revolution in Policing. Previously Farmer had been Special Assistant to the Police Commissioner in the New York City Police Department (1971-1974). The Police Commissioner was Patrick V. Murphy, and he wrote the following letter to Farmer when Murphy left the NYPD in 1973. \\"Dear David: This is to express my thanks for all the assistance you have provided me since October 1971 as my special assistant. Your contribution to the Department has been substantial. You have conceived, initiated and implemented such management innovations as the Manpower Allocation Review System (MARS), the Management Objectives Program, and the Master Plan System. You have contributed to increasing management and operational effectiveness in such areas as investigations, and you have directed research and analysis in such areas including organization, manpower allocation, management practices and administrative procedures. Your advice on matters of Department policy and management has been extremely helpful. Your services to me and to the Department have been of the highest professional level and extremely effective. They are appreciated. Sincerely, Pat.\\" As an example of a non- useful but even more pleasant activity, there was the night of November 14-15, 1972, when Farmer was - as certified in a certificate signed by Mayor John V. Lindsey - night mayor for the city of New York. The job was to stay throughout the night in City Hall and notify the Mayor by telephone if any crisis arose: nothing happened during Farmer's night - zero. In previous years, Farmer worked for two Chicago management consulting organizations - Public Administration Service and The Jacobs Company. Public Administration Service had long been located at 1313 East 60th Street - a distinguished road built for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. When he arrived in 1965, it consisted of 21 nonprofit institutions - including PAS. He provided management consulting services about organization and methods, human resources such as salaries and classifications, and other governmental issues. Client public agencies that Farmer worked for included the state of Montana; city of Tacoma, Washington; city of Atlanta, Georgia; New York State Conference of Mayors; Milwaukee city and county, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri; city of Moberly, Missouri; city of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; city of Joliet, Illinois; Plymouth Township, Pennsylvania; Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia; Evanston Public Library, Evanston, Illinois; city of Independence, Missouri; Maryland State Department of education; the state of Illinois; Grand Rapids, Michigan; city of Denver, Colorado; and Sterling Heights, Michigan. The Jacobs Company (which became part of Planning Research Corporation) also provided consulting services to governments. Tom Jacobs had once worked with Chicago's Mayor Richard J. Daley. Farmer's management consulting work was mainly for cities in the Model Cities Program. It was conducted, therefore, for the federal government's Department of Housing and Urban Development: HUD was the client. Cities to which Farmer was assigned to provide management consultation included Salt Lake City, Utah; Reading, Pennsylvania; Laredo, Texas; and Los Angeles, California. Farmer's experience also extended to governmental and public administration consulting services outside the United States - in Canada and Australia. Farmer worked for the Saskatchewan Provincial Budget Bureau as a budget and administrative analyst, which he held from April 1960 to August 1961. In Farmer's words, the Budget Bureau had developed a \\"solid reputation and had long attracted talented staff.\\" Some of Budget Bureau staff would later come to be known as the \\"Saskatchewan Mafia,\\" a term of endearment with no connection with criminality but highlighting practical management effectiveness.https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/12473 At the budget bureau, Farmer worked as a budget analyst on a quarter of Saskatchewan's budget; he conducted an organization and methods study for one of the government departments; and he wrote a book on the stated functions of the different parts of the government's administrative structure. Farmer worked with the Budget Bureau while Thomas Clement Douglas was premier of Saskatchewan. Douglas, a political forerunner to Bernie Sanders, was premier of Saskatchewan from 1944 to 1961, leading the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation Party (the predecessor to the New Democratic Party) and was most notably a democratic socialist. His government was the first democratic socialist government in North America, and subsequently introduced the first single-payer Medicare system to the continent in 1962. It is in this environment that one can see Farmer's later academic thinking on equity. To be part of a governmental process with the intent to provide a healthcare system and to be part of a provincial government so against the traditional grain of the time speaks volumes to his later work. However, suggestive of the other side of the political spectrum, Farmer has long been a member of the International Churchill Society. His understanding of political and other disciplinary perspectives (e.g., post-traditional, neuroscience, philosophical and historical perspectives) have been influenced in part by studying and by individuals. The latter include his wife (Dr. Rosemary Lee Farmer, a Professor of Social Work whose publications include a book on the relevance of neuroscience). In September of 1961, Farmer took a position with the Treasury Department of the Australian Federal Government, where, according to Farmer, he did “nothing of significance” beyond learning. Two months later in December of 1961, he left, and would eventually take a position with the Ontario Provincial Government.https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10841806.2017.1293462?src=recsys https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10841806.2017.1293459 Farmer worked as an economist at the Ontario Civil Service Commission from June 1962 to May 1963. In June of 1963, he became an organization and methods analyst with the Ontario Treasury Department's Organization and Methods Services, which he held until May of 1964. The Ontario Department of Economics and Development appointed Farmer to be the Chief of Methods Research in June of 1964,a position Farmer held until October of 1965. During his time with the Ontario provincial government, Farmer began pursuing a Masters in Economics degree from the University of Toronto. He received his M.A. in Economics in 1964, and his dissertation (Canadian Masters Thesis) was on the origins of the English National Health Service. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10841806.2017.1293462 It was also during the latter period that Farmer worked for the Chief Economist of the Ontario Government, then Hugh Ian McDonald. In a letter dated October 29, 1965, Ian McDonald wrote to Farmer stating \\"Dear David. Before you depart, I would like to tell you how much I have appreciated the generous assistance which you provided me during the last few months. Although I often had occasion to be grateful for your cooperation, I have been particularly conscious of your contribution in the past few weeks, as I have prepared to carry out the reorganization. It is not customary for civil servants to find monuments erected to themselves but I shall consider that you have made a lasting impact on the important work we are undertaking here and I thank you for that. With my very best wishes in your new career and new surroundings. Yours sincerely, Ian.\\" In 1980 Farmer joined the faculty of Virginia Commonwealth University's Department of Administration of Justice and Public Safety in the School of Community and Public Affairs. He initially taught four classes, then became chair and taught two graduate-level courses and served on various committees within the university. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10841806.2017.1293462 While a faculty member at Virginia Commonwealth University, Farmer received his two doctorates in 1984 and in 1989. While working on his second Ph.D., he was exposed to the French Postmodernist philosophers of the period - Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Jean Baudrillard, among others. These influences contributed significantly to the evolution of the post-traditional theory in Farmer's writings, notably the Language of Public Administration (1995), and can also be seen throughout his later works To Kill the King (2005), Public Administration in Perspective (2010), and Beyond Public Administration: Contemplating and Nudging Government-in-Context (2020). https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10841806.2017.1293462 Dr. Robert Cunningham (University of Tennessee, Knoxville) wrote that Farmer \\"sets his ideas on the high road, the big picture, and implications for the future, adhering to the principle that ideas should be explained as simply as possible without distorting the reality...\\" (Cunningham, 2009, 302). Dr. Gary Marshall (University of Nebraska at Omaha) wrote that \\"Within public administration and political science, David Farmer is a mentor to many and an inspiration to all who know him.\\" (G. Marshall, 2011, p. 1) Pdf. The International Journal of Organization Theory and Behavior twice devoted its entire issue (e.g. in 2016) to Farmer's work. Ten articles were contributed by academics from various parts of the world (e.g., from the United States and from China and Argentina), practitioners and former doctoral students. It described and illustrated the breadth and depth of Farmer's iconic contributions to post- traditional public administration theory and practice. In the closing article, Orion White concluded that “David Farmer’s monumental contribution is to have laid the foundation stone from which a new Public Administration culture can be built.” Articles included those titled “What is Newark?” “Applying Farmer’s Lenses: Two Illustrations,” “Of Rhizomes and Pointillism: David John Farmer’s Influence,” “The Practicality of Poetic Contemplation: A Reflection on David Farmer as a Methodologist,” and “David Farmer’s Body of Work: A Retrospective and Prospective View.  Books   Beyond Public Administration: Contemplating and Nudging Government-in-Context  This 2020 book asks the reader to contemplate how public administration (P.A.) or other discipline can provide leadership in helping American government to govern fundamentally better in terms of policy. Government-in-context, meaning government-in- totality, is useful for contemplation and nudging. It explains contemplation of the powerfully constricting contextual features of a mal-trinity of infiltration, exfiltration, and post-truth. Practical plans for P.A. leadership to assist in impacting the mal-trinity are explained in terms of 18 sets of aims or nudges. Nudge is a term associated with the prods used in Behavioral Economics, and a nudge used in this book can be a prod, a shove, or a hammer blow. Four tentative P.A. leadership stages (or steps) are proposed and described. To Kill the King: Post-traditional Governance and Bureaucracy This 2005 book discusses a post-traditional consciousness that aims to revitalize governance and bureaucracy. To Kill the King explains such consciousness in terms of three concepts analyzed as thinking as play, justice as seeking, and practice as art. It describes a post-traditional consciousness of governance that can yield improvements in the quality of life for each individual and for future generations. The publisher claims that the book aims to \\"capture the heart, and enlarge the soul, of reform movements within the study of governance and bureaucracy.\\" O.C. McSwite, formerly of Virginia Tech and George Washington Universities, wrote: \\"I consider this book to be a major and distinctive contribution to the field of public administration and to the discourse about the future of government in the United States as well\\" (O.C. McSwite, 2009, p. 303).  The Language of Public Administration: Bureaucracy, Modernity and Postmodernity.  This book argues that modern public administration theory, although valuable, is limiting as an explanatory and catalytic force in resolving problems about the functioning of public bureaucracy and in transforming public bureaucracy into a more positive force. The Language of Public Administration (1995) specifies a reflexive language paradigm for public administration thinking. It aims to show how the study and practice of public administration can be reinvigorated. Dr. Alexander Kouzmin (Southern Cross University and University of South Australia) writes that “Unrivalled by peers, Dr. Farmer has a vibrant language of public administration transgressing what is sayable and what is un-sayable (A. Kouzmin, 2011, p. 803). The Language of Public Administration was listed as one of the candidate books for “great books of public administration, 1990-2010” (Meier & O’Toole, 2012, p. 890). The Language of Public Administration has been translated into Chinese and Korean. It was translated into Chinese in 2005. The Korean translation was published in 1999 by Pakyoung Publishing Company.Publishing company website.  Public Administration in Perspective: Theory and Practice through Multiple Lenses  The book explains and illustrates how public administration can benefit from epistemic pluralism – just as can any other action or social science discipline, currently operating essentially within its own disciplinary cul-de-sac. Public Administration in Perspective (2010) explains that epistemic refers to knowing; pluralism refers to more than one way. The book offers an example of a grand strategy of epistemic pluralism. It examines public administration theory and practice from perspectives that include a traditional, a business, an economic, a political, a critical theory, a post-structural, a psychoanalytic, a neuroscience, a feminist, an ethical, and a data lens. It begins by quoting Dwight Waldo’s claim that “administrative thought must establish a working relationship with every major province in the realm of human learning.” Dr. Breena Coates (California State University, San Bernardino) writes about Public Administration in Perspective that the “author provides unique and, hitherto, unexplored perspectives from which to view the multiple faces of public administration… The book’s scholarship is compelling and hard to resist… Today in our networked, globalized environment we are more than ever coming to the realization that there is an interdisciplinary basis for understanding truth, and that each discrete branch of knowledge studies a mere subset of particularized knowledge streams” (B. Coates, 2012, p. 133.) Pdf1. Pdf2.  Being in Time: The Nature of Time in Light of McTaggart's Paradox  Following and analyzing the philosopher John McTaggart, this book discusses two views or conceptions of time. One corresponds to the 'ordinary' position, and the other to the 'received wisdom' position of Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein. Avoiding such prejudicial titles, the two views are called the tensed (the A-theory) and the tenseless (the B-theory) conceptions of time. The varied ways in which philosophers have fleshed out the specifics of the tensed and tenseless views are contemplated in the book. Crime Control: The Use and Misuse of Police Resources The book presents a comprehensive examination of police resources allocation decision making and documents research indicating opportunities for better utilization of police resources. The publisher of this 1984 book (Crime Control) claims that the book should be read by \\"those working in the fields of law and society, criminology, sociology, political science, criminal law, and criminal justice.\\" The former N.Y.P.D. Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy wrote of this book that “In recent years, American policing has benefited greatly from the observations and analyses of scholars and researchers, particularly when they have had on-line experience in police agencies at one or another stage in their careers. David J. Farmer is a scholar who has had such experience, which adds a special dimension to his observations and conclusions” (Patrick V. Murphy, 1984, p. vii.)

A. ambiguus is one of eight species in the ant genus Anochetus to have been described from fossils found in Dominican amber and is one of a number of Anochetus species found in the Greater Antillies. History and classification Anochetus brevidentatus is known from two solitary fossil insects which are inclusions in transparent chunks of Dominican amber. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America, and up to southern Mexico. The type specimen was collected from the La Toca Mine near las Aguitas, while the second specimen is from an undetermined amber mine. Both are from fossil bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains in the northern Dominican Republic. The amber dates from at least the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera and may be as old as the Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene age range is only the youngest that it might be. At the time of description, the holotype specimen was preserved in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. The holotype fossil was first studied by entomologist William MacKay with his 1991 type description of the new species being published in the Journal of the New York Entomological Society. The specific epithet brevidentatus is derived Latin as a reference to the short length of the spines on the petiole. The second known specimen was identified by entomologist Maria L. De Andrade of the University of Basle from a specimen in the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart amber collections and briefly described in 1994. A. brevidentatus is one of eight Anochetus species which have been described from Dominican amber. One species, A. corayi, was published earlier than A. brevidentatus, being described in 1980. The remaining six species; A. ambiguus, A. conisquamis, A. dubius, A. exstinctus, A. intermedius, and A. lucidus were all described by De Andrade in the same 1994 paper. A number of modern species live in the Greater Antilles, with at least three modern species found on Hispaniola.  Description  The Anochetus ambiguus type specimen is well preserved, though it shows some distortion from the amber moving after entombment and is missing some body structures. The second specimen has an estimated body length of . The mesosoma has distinct fine striae covering most of its surface and the gaster is smooth and shiny. The upper side of the head, mandibles, pronotum, and gaster sport sparse erect hairs. The mandibles have a flare in width near the center of their length and sport between 9 and 10 teeth with the apical three teeth on each mandible blade elongated and slender for grasping prey. The propodium sports short spines on the rear edge, while the petiole two spines which angle vertically up from the petiole face.

It opened in 1924, and ran 36.4 km across the southern slopes of Mount Taranaki to link the rural town of Opunake with the Marton–New Plymouth Line at Te Roti. With the decline of rural freight, part of the line was closed in 1976, but the 10.9 km section to Kapuni was retained and upgraded to service traffic to the Kapuni natural gas field.  History  A branch line of \\"about 23 miles\\" to Opunake was authorised in 1912 for £400,000 by the Railways Authorization Act, 1912. Work commenced in 1914, and earthworks reached Kapuni by 1916, but progress was slowed by World War I. Work was suspended in December 1917, and recommenced in March 1919. At the peak 200 men were employed on line works, including a large 1.6 km cutting near Waiteika. The Waingongoro Bridge near Te Roiti, an unusual (for New Zealand) brick arch bridge, was completed in 1921, and the second bridge in 1923. The Public Works Department began running goods trains to Kapuni from 1 August 1923, and to Mangawhero Road by December 1924. The Opunake terminal was reached on 8 June 1925. On 12 July 1926 the Railways Department took over the line, with three goods trains each way a week plus passenger services. A 9km branch from Kapuni to Manaia was built in 1920-24 to service a ballast pit on the Kaupokonui River but was closed and the track lifted by 1926. Passenger services on the branch ended on 16 October 1955. DB class diesels were used from December 1966, then DC class diesels from the 1980s. On April 1976 it was decided to close the line beyond Kapuni from July, and the 10.9 km section to Kapuni was upgraded and renamed the Kapuni Branch. Today the former 25.5km section from Kapuni to Opunake has \\"plenty of railway remnants to satisfy the enthusiast\\" with sections of roadbed, cuttings, goods shed and loading bay at Pihama and a locomotive shed, gateposts, a platform and goods loading bank at Opunake.

He was born in 1954 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.  Broadcast television, internet, CDROM/DVD  Bob Connolly produced and directed \\"Passport to Adventure\\" and \\"Timeless Places\\" which aired in reruns for 8 years from 1996 to 2002 in Canada on VisionTV, The Life Channel, The Learning Channel and CTV Travel. In a travelogue format, the series dealt with the unexplained mysteries of the world and provided information to the viewer as to how to visit the places mentioned in the program. The subject matter included lost technology and civilizations, Pyramids, comparative religions, unexplained architecture and psychic phenomena. His former wife, Bea Broda Connolly was a coproducer and host of the show. A CDROM version of Timeless Places was produced using material not seen on the series. Apple computer eventually licensed an interactive CDROM version of the Timeless Places TV series, rebranded as \\"The Search For Ancient Wisdom\\" and gave the CD away free as a bundling deal to all K12 schools who purchased a computer with a CDROM drive. It was one of the first interactive commercial CDROMs produced. The Search for Ancient Wisdom was also licensed for playback on Windows computers. When the internet became the dominant delivery method for digital content, the Ancient Wisdom CDROM was eventually discontinued but the \\"controversial\\" content from the disk found a new life as pirated pictures such as unusual cone head skulls. They have flooded conspiracy websites all over the world. When high speed internet access became affordable to the home user, Robert Connolly received the very first grant from Bell Canada's Bell Fund to develop and produce free broadband video programming for the internet. One hour TV specials called Virtual Europe and Virtual Canada were produced for The Canadian Learning Channel, which when aired, directed viewers to experience the travel destinations online in video and as a downloadable eBook. Bob and Bea Broda (Bob's former wife) still maintain a YouTube Channel featuring their travel destinations.  Books, eBooks and magazine articles  Bob Connolly is the author of a print book titled Dynamic Media – Music, Video, Animation and the Web. According to Pearson Publishing's press release, this book was the first of its kind by offering an interactive rich media PDF on CDROM which is bundled with the book. The book/CDROM eBook teaches you how to make interactive eBooks in PDF. Connolly is also an expert in the positive therapeutical aspects of electromagnetic fields and lectures on the subject. In 2012, Robert W Connolly released Frequency Therapy – A Quick Start Guide to MAS. The interactive eBook details how to use electromagnetic fields to treat a wide variety of illness. He currently assists health related companies to produce their interactive eBooks for the iPad. Public speaking When Dynamic Media was first released, Connolly wrote many articles for magazines that detailed how to make interactive PDF and extensively toured the United States as a convergence-technology expert to give presentations of his interactive eBooks at well attended Adobe Acrobat publishing conventions and How Design Conferences. Connolly often introduces new technology to audiences and this includes the healthcare industry. He believes the future of medicine lies in \\"frequency therapy\\" that is generated via computers. As a companion to pharmaceuticals, electrosceuticals and photonics ( laser therapy ) can be used to treat a wide variety of illnesses that are considered to be incurable. He often lectures on this subject at alternative health conventions. Music production Robert Connolly released one record in 1978 titled Plateau in which he plays keyboards ( Minimoog, Hammond B3, Mellotron) bass and guitar. The record was produced and engineered by Connolly and was recorded in his private recording studio in Hamilton Ontario Canada.

These include the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan and the territories of Nunavut and Yukon. Of these four provinces and territories, municipalities in Alberta were the only ones that exercise the option to conduct a municipal census as of 2006.  Alberta  Total amount of municipal censuses conducted by year according to Alberta Municipal Affairs population lists Alberta's Municipal Government Act (MGA) is the enabling legislation that allows its municipalities to conduct their own censuses. The MGA also stipulates that the Minister of Alberta Municipal Affairs (AMA) may regulate how municipal populations are determined and how they are conducted. The regulation that stipulates these is the MGA's Determination of Population Regulation (DOPR). The DOPR provides a three-month period for municipalities to conduct censuses, which begins on April 1 and ends on June 30, and requires the municipalities to set a census date within this period relating to enumeration. It also requires that censuses be conducted in accordance with a training manual approved by the Minister of AMA, and submission of the results to AMA before September 1 of the same year in which the census is conducted. The results become the populations of the submitting municipalities if they are accepted by the Minister of AMA. The conducting of municipal censuses in Alberta is widespread. Between 2007 and 2011 inclusive, the last full five-year period between Statistics Canada's releases of the last two federal censuses, 157 of its 357 municipalities conducted at least one municipal census. Of these, each of Alberta's 17 cities and 8 Metis settlements conducted censuses, as well as 64 of its 108 towns, 45 of its 93 villages, 3 of its 51 summer villages, 3 of its 5 specialized municipalities and 17 of its 64 municipal districts. In 2013, at least 40 municipalities conducted censuses. Alberta recognized censuses conducted by 38 of these municipalities. Municipalities choose to conduct their own censuses with the goal of acceptance by Alberta Municipal Affairs for multiple reasons. Municipal censuses allow for collection of important demographic data to assist in the planning and provision of community services. They also allow municipalities experiencing high levels of population growth to capitalize on increased provincial grant funding involving population per capita formulae. Some municipalities simply choose to conduct a census to verify it has grown since the last federal census. Historically, municipal censuses are conducted via paper-based enumeration of households done door-to-door. More recently, municipalities have been permitted to conduct them electronically door-to-door using wireless handheld devices or online with census question responses being entered directly into a secure census database by a representative of the household. During enumeration, only those people enumerated that are \\"usual residents\\" of that municipality may be included in the total population count. However, a municipality may enumerate those that are not \\"usual residents\\" as its \\"shadow population\\" if approved by the Minister of AMA.  Nunavut  The Cities, Towns and Villages Act and the Hamlets Act enables Nunavut's municipalities to conduct their own censuses. As of 2006, municipalities in Nunavut were not exercising their opportunities to conduct their own censuses.  Saskatchewan  The Municipalities Act allows municipalities within Saskatchewan to conduct their own censuses. The City of Lloydminster, which straddles Saskatchewan's provincial boundary with Alberta, conducted municipal censuses in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2013. Convinced Statistics Canada undercounted its population during the Canada 2011 Census, the Town of La Ronge conducted its own census in 2012.  Yukon  Municipalities in Yukon may conduct their own censuses pursuant to the Municipal Act. As of 2006, municipalities in Yukon were not exercising their opportunities to conduct their own censuses.

In 2011 Karlsson joined the Northeastern Huskies. In his Freshman year, Karlsson was the Huskies' leading scorer with 10 goals and 16 assists. Limited to 17 games due to season-ending injury in his Sophomore year, he scored five goals and three assists in his last season at Northeastern University. In July 2013 the Ottawa Senators of the NHL announced they had signed Karlsson to a two-year entry-level contract. During the 2013–14 season, Karlsson played 8 games with the Binghamton Senators, Ottawa's American Hockey League affiliate, recording no Points, and 39 games with the Elmira Jackals of the ECHL, recording 11 Goals and 13 Assists.

On 12 March 2015, the Dallas Stars reassigned both Karlsson and Troy Vance from the Steelheads to the Missouri Mavericks of the ECHL as part of a deal in which the Mavericks traded Martin Lee and future considerations to the Steelheads. Having left the Stars organization at the conclusion of his entry-level contract, Karlsson opted to remain in the ECHL, signing a one-year deal with the Orlando Solar Bears on 6 August 2015. Before appearing in a game with the Solar Bears in the 2015–16 season, Karlsson was traded for future considerations to the Colorado Eagles on 26 October 2015.

After a spell in Sweden, Karlsson moved to the UK in the summer of 2017 to sign for MK Lightning ahead of their inaugural EIHL season.

Training night and day for her matches, Glena’s total commitment throws her family into crisis, with her children needing her care and her time at her job conflicting with her rigorous workout schedule. But if she can give her all and continue to win her fights, she has a shot at the big time and a future as a professional athlete. Can Glena triumph?  Production  Filming of Glena began in November 2010 in Oregon. The movie was shot on a low budget. The main camera used was a Canon XH-A1, and a Panasonic DVX-100 was used to shoot some early footage. The one-man-crew relied on a wireless lavaliere microphone and camera-mounted shotgun microphone to capture audio. Available lighting was used almost exclusively, though a camera-mounted LitePanels Micro was utilized at times. Luebke, who also edited the film, utilized extensive post-production techniques including ADR and sound design to create the film's elaborate fight sequences. Luebke made use of a $5,000 Kickstarter campaign to raise funds. The Kickstarter campaign was originally intended to pay for two months of editing on a short film version, but the project would ultimately be in production for another three years as a feature-length film was developed.  Release  Glena world premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival on January 18, 2014. It was one of only eight documentaries selected from 5,000 films submitted. It has also played at the Sarasota Film Festival, Newport Beach Film Festival, Maryland Film Festival, Brooklyn Film Festival, San Francisco DocFest, Philadelphia Independent Film Festival, Downtown Film Festival - Los Angeles, Tacoma Film Festival, Rocky Mountain Women's Film Festival, and more. The movie received the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the Women + Film VOICES Film Festival in Denver, Colorado, the Special Jury Award for Inspirational Filmmaking at the Arizona International Film Festival in Tucson, Arizona, and the Special Jury Award at Indie Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee. It was selected as the Opening Night Film at the Portland Film Festival. Its American television premiere was on Showtime on September 25, 2014. It released on VOD on August 11, 2015.

The abbreviation, NEA, stands for \\"Neuman & Esser in Aachen\\". NEA is a manufacturer of reciprocating compressors and grinding systems for several industries, including oil and gas, chemical and petrochemical, food industry and renewable energy.Reciprocating compressors in use in photovoltaics and for biogas feed, In: Pumps and Compressors for the World Market with Compressed Air and Vacuum Technology 2012 History Neuman & Esser was founded as \\"J. L. Neuman & Cie. Maschinenfabrik\\" in 1830 during the Industrial Revolution. Brothers Johann Leonard Neuman and Friedrich August Neuman started the company, \\"Gebrüder Neuman\\", in 1829, which was later renamed \\"J. L. Neuman & Cie. Maschinenfabrik\\" in 1830. During that same year, the Neuman's brother-in- law, Theodor Esser, became partner of the company. This emergence founded the name of the company, known today, as \\"Neuman & Esser\\". Friedrich August Neuman also worked in boiler construction, that also still exists today, in Eschweiler, under the name \\"FA Neuman GmbH & Co. KG\\".Rita Mielke (Hrsg.): Neuman & Esser 1830–2005, Grenz-Echo-Verlag Eupen (B), 2005, First Logo of Neuman & Esser In the beginning, NEA produced hydraulic presses, decatizing rollers, reciprocating steam-powered engines and napping mills. Additionally, NEA serviced defective existing machines of customers. In 1888, the company moved into a new and larger production hall in the Clasenstraße, near the Aachen West railway station. In the year 1891, Oscar Peters presided as the sole owner of the machinery factory. Since then, Neuman & Esser has been owned by the Peters family. Production hall near the Aachen West railway station in the year 1888 In the early 1900s, NEA expanded its product portfolio to include piston steam engines, reciprocating compressors, vacuums, liquid pumps and drying systems. Later, in 1930-1931, crushing plants followed. Neuman & Esser acquired the licenses for the construction of the Raymond pendulum roller mills from the insolvent company, Mehler. At the same time, NEA developed the first oil-free, dry-running compressor. The oil-free compressors became an increasingly important aspect of brewing in the food industry as well as in the chemical industry. In 1972, Neuman & Esser expanded its facilities to a new factory site in Übach-Palenberg 20 km away from Aachen. Providing 250 local employees jobs at the time, NEA provides over 1000 employees jobs worldwide today. This change of company headquarters enabled the opportunity to development from an individual company to a group of companies with offices in ten countries. The worldwide offices account for 3 holdings in Germany, United States and China, 3 manufacturing factories in Germany, 14 sales and applications centers in over 9 countries, and six compressor service centers in over 5 countries.Neuman & Esser Leaves Room for Growth, In: CompressorTechTwo, Issue Jan./ Feb. 2012 These groups of companies comprise to form the name behind Neuman & Esser Group.Neuman & Esser Group opens fourth new Facility, In: CompressorTechTwo, Issue March 2009  Controversy  In 2017, Neuman & Esser faced strong public criticism after an executive employee reported a Scottish man to the Dubai authorities for accidentally touching his hip in a crowded Dubai bar. The employee later retracted the accusation; however, NEA released a statement supporting the case against the Scotsman, who was subsequently sentenced to three months in prison. Divisions Neuman & Esser Group includes divisions in sales and application centers for reciprocating compressors and grinding and classifying systems, compressor aftermarket spare parts and repairs service centers, as well as its holdings. Reciprocating compressors Reciprocating compressors, also called recips or piston compressors, from NEA compress air and technical gases. Oil-free and lubricated reciprocating compressors range up to 100,000 Nm³/h suction volume, 30,000 kW driving power and 1,000 bar final pressure are produced at the headquarters in Übach-Palenberg and in Wurzen near Leipzig. The larger compressors are manufactured in Übach- Palenberg and smaller sizes are built in Wurzen. The core competence in the production of compressors has also been expanded through the acquisition of Stasskol, a manufacturer of piston rings and sealing systems.Compressor engineering: innovative valve control enables high efficiency, In: Pumps and Compressors for the World Market with Compressed Air and Vacuum Technology 2013 Grinding and Classifying Systems Neuman & Esser has built grinding systems since 1930. The first product was the pendulum roller mill, which dominated the market for a long time with its particularly robust design. In 1994, NEA introduced its own impact classifier mill to the market and in 1998, the company received the patent. NEA mills are used for applications within the ceramic and chemical industries, including pigment production and processing technologies. In recent years, the areas of powder coating production, confectionery and the food industries have followed. Aftermarket In addition to the production of compressors and grinding systems Neuman & Esser offers service. Founded in 1983, NEA separated the customer service in 1988 as NEAC Compressor Service, an independent enterprise.NEAC Compressor Service expands Aftermarket Capabilities, In: CompressorTechTwo, Issue April 2010 During the first 10 years, NEAC was a joint venture with Atlas Copco. The global sales network provided by the large partner enabled to move directly into international business. The clear split between aftermarket and new machinery business provided both greater transparency and a clear focus on the company divisions. NEAC is the service organization for all piston compressor products of the Neuman & Esser Group.

It operates majorly in the downstream sector of the Nigeria’s Oil and Gas industry, but has diversified its businesses into other sectors of the energy value chain. The downstream division specializes in the distribution of a wide range of petroleum products; Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), diesel, aviation fuel, kerosene, as well as a range of lubricants for various automobiles and machines; distributed mostly to the automobile, industrial, aviation and marine markets. History Ardova Plc (formerly Forte Oil PLC) was incorporated on December 11, 1964 as British Petroleum. After 14 years in operation, the company changed its status from a private limited liability company to a public liability company. In compliance with the provisions of the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree of 1977, 40% of the company’s shares were sold to Nigerians and a year later, 60% was acquired by the Federal Government of Nigeria in favour of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) from British Petroleum. In November 1979 its name was changed to African Petroleum PLC. NNPC’s stake in AP was reduced by 20% in March 1989 after the Federal Government sold the above percentage to Nigerian Citizens, increasing their stake from 40% to 60%. In the year 2000, the Federal Government under its privatization programme divested its remaining 40% to core investors and interested Nigerians. In May 2007, the shareholding structure took another dimension as Incorporated Trustees of NNPC’s Pension Fund divested its stake to Zenon Petroleum & Gas Limited, owned by Femi Otedola, making it the majority shareholder in the company. As a result, Mr. Otedola and his affiliated entities became the core investor in the company. Under the new management, African Petroleum embarked on a rebranding and restructuring programme which led to a name change to Forte Oil PLC in December, 2010, and a rebranding of the retail outlets spread across the across the country. In 2013 the company purchased a controlling stake in the 414 MW Geregu Power plant under a government-led privatisation programme in the power industry under the leadership of Goodluck Jonathan. Geregu Power Plant was commissioned in 2007 with three Siemens V94.2 open cycle gas turbine power generation units, namely GT11, GT12, and GT13, with an initial combined installed capacity of 414MW. A major overhaul of the plant commenced in 2015 and was completed in 2016, increasing the combined capacity to 435MW. In 2015 they signed an $83 million contract with Siemens to upgrade the 414 MW plant, the work is due to be completed in 2016 As at June 20, 2019, approx. 75% controlling shares of Forte oil were purchased by Prudent Energy and Services owned by Abdulwasiu Sowami through Sowami's investment company Ignite Investments and Commodities Limited, thus effectively giving Sowami controlling shares of Forte oil excluding the Geregu Power plant. At an Extra- ordinary General Meeting (EGM) held in Lagos on December 18, 2019, shareholders of Forte Oil PLC authorised the board of directors to change the company's name to Ardova Plc. The new name, along with a new logo and tagline was officially launched to the public on February 19, 2020. Operations overview Ardova Plc (formerly Forte Oil PLC) operates a network of about 450 retail outlets spread across the Country with major fuel storage installations at both Apapa (Lagos State) and Onne (Rivers State), an aviation joint users hydrant in Lagos, and joint aviation depots in Abuja, Port Harcourt and Kano, serving the aviation industry. With presence in the 36 states of Nigeria and Abuja and a spread of retail outlets in Ghana, the Company markets premium motor spirit (PMS), automotive motor oil (Diesel), dual purpose kero (DPK), fuel oils and Jet A-1 fuel amongst others. It also manufactures and distributes a range of lubricants, some of which include Super V, Visco 2000 etc. at its lubricating oil blending plant at Apapa, Lagos Nigeria. The Company also provides well production chemicals and drilling fluids to Nigeria’s petroleum upstream operators through its upstream services subsidiary, Forte Upstream Services. Subsidiaries Although Forte Oil operates majorly in the downstream sector of the Oil and Gas industry, it has diversified its business operations through the following subsidiaries: :*AP Oil & Gas Ghana limited (APOG) : [AP Oil and Gas Ghana Limited] (APOG) commenced operations in July 2008 with a single outlet and a few industrial customers in a bid to build a transnational oil company.

Flinders Petrie. His interest in Egyptology probably began in 1877, when the novelist Amelia B. Edwards published her best seller, \\"A 1000 Miles Up the Nile\\". Edwards was a long-time supporter of Petrie. Haworth and his wife read her book and they were soon following her journey up the Nile. Haworth was a partner in the Manchester firm of James Dilworth and Sons. As well as sponsoring Egyptology, he also collected paintings and Wedgwood ceramics. Petrie recalls in his autobiography \\"While in England, I heard that the offer of help in excavating came from Jesse Haworth of Manchester, though the kind intervention of Miss Edwards. Just at the same time, I had an offer of assistance from Martyn Kennard who had a family interest in Egypt. Nevertheless, I did not wish to pledge my time to be entirely at the service of anyone. The plan, which worked very smoothly, was that I drew on my two friends for all the costs of workmen and transport, while I paid all my expenses. In return, we equally divided all that came to England. Thus it was in my interest to fund as much as I could.\\" In 1890 Haworth and Kennard presented their collection of objects from Kahun, and another Fayoum town site Gurob, to The Manchester Museum. In 1912 with the collection rapidly expanding, Haworth made a substantial contribution to the building fund to primarily house the Egyptian collections. In recognition of his generosity, and of his position as one of the first patrons of scientific excavation in Egypt, The University of Manchester conferred upon Jesse Haworth the honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws. In 1919, Jesse Haworth donated a further £10,000 to the museum, and under the terms of his Will, in 1921, he bequeathed a further £30,000 along with his private collection of Egyptian Antiquities. In 1920, Haworth approved plans for a third stage of the Museum building which would provide a further display area as well as much-needed workrooms and a storage space for the collection. His widow opened this extension in November 1927.

In that year he was appointed London correspondent for a number of leading New Zealand newspapers in the New Zealand Associated Press, which he continued to do until shortly before he died.Press, 23 Apr 1908, p.7 He took a close interest in railways over many years and in 1884 and 1885 he did a thorough study of the British rail network, involving around 40,000 miles of travel. In 1887 the results were embodied in a report to the New Zealand Minister of Public Works entitled on the Railways of Great Britain, which received favourable reviews.Otago Daily Times, 9 Jul 1908, p.12 He is chiefly known for recording a speed of 102.3 mph on the 'Ocean Mail' special from Plymouth to London hauled by GWR locomotive 3440 City of Truro on 9 May 1904, the first time that a steam locomotive was recorded to have achieved 100 mph. Between the years of 1902 and 1908 he wrote a series of articles for The Railway Magazine on British locomotive practice and performance. In 1990, these were collated and reprinted in book form.

In 2013, Arıkan received the IEEE W.R.G. Baker Award for his contributions to information theory, particularly for his development of polar coding. In December 2017 he was honored with the 2018 Richard W. Hamming Medal. In June 2018, he received the Shannon Award.  Career   Education  In 1981, Arıkan received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the California Institute of Technology. He finished his M.S. and Ph.D. studies in Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 1982 and 1985 respectively.  Academic background  Arıkan served as an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign before returning to Turkey. He joined Bilkent University as a faculty member in 1987. In 2008 Arıkan invented polar codes, a system of coding that provides a mathematical basis for the solution of Shannon's channel capacity problem. A three-session lecture on the matter given in January 2015 at Simons Institute's Information Theory Boot Camp at the University of California, Berkeley is available on YouTube. The lecture is also featured on the Simons Institute webpage, which includes the slides used by Arıkan in his presentation. Arıkan is an IEEE Fellow, and was chosen as an IEEE Distinguished Lecturer for 2014-2015.  Awards  In 2010, Arıkan received the IEEE Information Theory Society Paper Award and the Sedat Simavi Science Award for the solution of a problem related to the construction of coding schemes that send information at a rate better suited to the capacity of communication channels. The problem had remained unresolved ever since the field of information theory was first established by Claude Shannon in 1948. Arıkan became the recipient for the Kadir Has Achievement Award in 2011 for the same accomplishment. He was named an IEEE fellow in 2012. In 2013 he received the IEEE W.R.G.

Location The church building is located on the Old Port of Marseille.Marseille 13: Eglise Saint-Ferréol les Augustins The exact address is Quai des Belges, 13001 Marseille.Église Catholique à Marseille History The original building on site was owned by the Knights Templar.Official website: History However, in 1369, it was given to a community of Augustinian hermits.Gaston Duchet-Suchaux, Les ordres religieux, Paris: Flammarion, 1993, p. 26 By 1447, they decided to spearhead the construction a new church building. It was dedicated in 1542, even though the vault was only completed in 1588. During the Ancien Régime (15th century to 18th century), it was used for professional ceremonies. For example, ship-porters had their own altars in the church as early as 1390: one dedicated to Saint Peter, and a second one to Saint Paul. Pope Clement VII (1478–1534) married his niece, Catherine de' Medici (1519–1589), to Henry II of France (1519–1559), in this church on October 28, 1533. During the French Revolution of 1789, it came close to being destroyed. However, it was salvaged. Shortly after, it was renamed in honour of Saint Augustine. Later, it was sold to a businessman. Later, it was returned to the Catholic Church. The facade was destroyed in 1801, due to construction work on the street, and it was rebuilt in 1875. In 1803, it was named in honour of Saint Ferréol de Vienne, a Roman Catholic martyr from the 3rd century who was the namesake of another church in Marseille which was destroyed during the French Revolution. The high altar was designed by Dominique Fossaty, as were the altars of the Augustinians and of the ship- porters. Inside the church can also be found the Mazenod family's tomb dating back to 1564 and the Montolieu family's tomb, dating back to 1695. The relics of Saint Louis of Toulouse (1274–1297) are also in the church. The church has a few works of art. Three paintings by Michel Serre (1658-1733) are displayed inside the church: Sainte Marguerite, La Vierge à l'enfant apparaissant à Saint Pierre and Saint Paul. There is also a bust of Saint Ferréol de Vienne. Additionally, there is a sculpture of Saint Augustine designed by Raymond Servian (1903-1953). Another sculpture, by Élie-Jean Vézien (1890-1982), represents Saint Theresa. Yet another sculpture, this time by Louis Botinelly (1883-1962), is of Joan of Arc. A more recently sculpture, designed by Yves le Pape in 1979, depicts the Holy Family. The neogothic pipe organ, designed by Augustin Zieger, dates back to 1844. At present The church building is open every weekday from 9AM to 6:30PM. Mass is said every weekday at 12PM and 6PM, every Saturday at 6PM, every Sunday at 9:30AM, 11AM and 7PM.

He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2008, The Rome Prize in 2001 and a Visual Artist Fellowship from Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advance Study in 2007. His work spans a variety of media, including photography, site-specific installation, multiple channel immersive video installation, performance, and new media. Much of Attie's practice explores how a wide range of contemporary media may be used to re-imagine new relationships between space, time, place, and identity. Much of Attie's works in the 90s dealt with the history of World War II. He first garnered significant international attention by slide projecting images of past Jewish life onto contemporary locations in Berlin. More recent projects have involved using a range of media to engage local communities to find new ways of representing their history, memory and potential futures. Attie's artworks and interventions are site-specific and immersive in nature, and tend to engage subject matter that is both social, political and psychological. In 2013, five monographs have been published on Attie's work, which has also been the subject of a number of films aired on PBS, BBC, and ARD. Since receiving his MFA in 1991, Attie has realized approximately 25 major projects in ten countries around the world. Most recently, in 2013-14, Shimon Attie was awarded the Lee Krasner Lifetime Achievement Award in Art. Life Shimon Attie was born in 1957 and received an MFA in 1991. In 1991, he moved to Germany from his previous home in Northern California, and began to make work initially about Jewish identity and the history of the second World War. His work later evolved to engage broader issues of memory, place and identity more generally. Attie moved to New York City in 1997. Critical reaction Shimon Attie's work has been extensively reviewed by a wide variety of publications, including features and/or reviews in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, Art in America, Art News, Artforum, The Village Voice, The Boston Globe, and many others. Samples include: Yasaman Alipour, writing in \\"The Brooklyn Rail: Critical Perspectives on Arts, Politics, and Culture\\", on Attie's solo exhibition \\"Facts on the Ground\\" at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York City: \\"Celebrated for his approach, which blurs the line between installation and photography, Attie has spent his career moving from one city to the next to explore the trauma and history of the marginalized and to reflect on social memory and the construction of Identity. Seductive, daring, and clever, Facts on the Ground dives into the inherently charged and polarized politics of its subject matter. Attie achieves something profound: he presents a unique opportunity to contemplate Israel/Palestine without the distraction that is simultaneously a manifestation of the limitations of visual of written language and the possibilities of their alliance.\\" June 3, 2016 Holland Cotter, writing in The New York Times on one of Attie's works in the traveling exhibition \\"Art, AIDS, America\\": \\"…Less familiar work makes the strongest impression, benefiting from the element of surprise.

Chun has attended university at the Seoul Institute of the Arts studying creative writing studies; Hanyang University where she achieved a B.A. in Journalism, and; the Korea University Graduate School of literature. Although Chun has only produced two volumes of short stories, she is considered a groundbreaker in Korean literature, and her works have been the subject of much analysis. Work The Literature Translation Institute of Korea summarizes Chun's work: :Cheon’s works depart significantly from such thematic concerns as love, extra-marital affairs, and urban or middle-class sensibilities that characterized many of the fictional works by women in the 90s. The women in Cheon’s fictional world are defined not by their reaction to the traditional views of women but by their hedonistic tendencies and the feral, primeval instincts they possess. Such a vision of womanhood is often expressed through visceral and visually shocking images. “Breath” features an old woman who works at a butcher’s shop and relishes every part of the cows she dresses out for sale. She eats pieces of raw cow brain as a delicacy; she believes liver is a cure for dizziness and entrails, for indigestion. Her love for meat is taken to its grotesque extreme when she begins hankering for the taste of cow fetus. In “The Needle,” the protagonist is a tattooist who enjoys watching the first drop of blood oozing from skin. Female aggression embodied in the act of tattooing is contrasted against emasculated manhood symbolized by a monk whose murder provides the mystery that drives the narrative forward.Source-attribution\\"Chun Woon-young\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: :Cheon locates the source of such aggression in the prolonged state of oppression, alienation or fear. In “The Needle,” the protagonist’s work as a tattooist parallels her mother’s work as an embroiderer and points at her mother’s unhappy relationship with a monk. In “Your Ocean,” violent images of writhing eels being skinned alive accentuate the protagonist’s feeling of abandonment due to his father’s absence. Aggressive, animalistic behaviors are a defense mechanism triggered by the harsh reality, Cheon tells us.Source- attribution\\"Chun Woon-young\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Works in Translation * Adieu le cirque!

He is a two-time National Endowment for the Arts fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, and writer-in-residence at Grinnell College. Bakopoulos has a B.A. from the University of Michigan and an M.F.A. degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is also a faculty member in the Warren Wilson College MFA Program for Writers. Please Don't Come Back from the Moon (2005) was his debut novel, about fathers in Maple Rock, Detroit abandoning their families under a strange compulsion to go to the moon. It is narrated by the young Mikey, a would-be writer, whose father feels the same desire to leave. The New York Times said it \\"deftly weld[ed] magic realism with social satire\\". Entertainment Weekly gave it a B- saying it turned into a very conventional coming-of-age story. People gave it 3.5/4. In 2017, James Franco's Rabbit Bandini films released a film version of the novel, entitled Don't Come Back from the Moon, starring Franco, Rashida Jones, and Jeffrey Wahlberg. Bruce Thierry Cheung directed the film version, which was co-written by Bakopoulos.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5249200/ My American Unhappiness (2011), his second novel, is narrated by Zeke Pappas, a young man compiling an inventory of American unhappiness for a struggling non-profit organization. The New York Times found Bakopoulos charming but the book too frivolous and arch. The Los Angeles Times found that some of the characters were one- dimensional, there only to advance the plot, but found the satire was pleasantly combined with warmth and affection for its subjects. Summerlong, his third novel, was published by Ecco in June 2015. It was named a \\"best book\\" of 2017 by National Public Radio, which praised its sadly funny vibe, saying, \\"this book nails the entropy of adulthood.\\" Personal life In September 2015 he married Alissa Nutting. It is his second marriage. Bakopoulos and Nutting divide their time between Los Angeles and Iowa City, IA, along with their blended family of three children.

The Tracker's investigations are slow to progress until he recruits a young and very skilled aspyish computer hacker he codenames \\"Ariel\\" to act as his tech support. Ariel traces the digital signatures of the Preacher's sermons to find him somewhere in Somalia, but the Tracker realises that the Preacher must have an ally in England to broadcast his sermons from and act as a middleman between the Preacher and his followers: the Tracker's investigation into the Preacher's history uncovers an achaar mogul who is a childhood friend of the Preacher, and Ariel obtains his IP address to focus on the Preacher's location. Further investigations go nowhere until the Mossad reveals to TOSA that they have a Falasha agent codenamed \\"Opal\\" in Somalia who they can use to get close to the Preacher. Meanwhile, a band of Somali pirates allied with the Preacher capture a Swedish trawler, taking with them the young son of the shipping mogul who had served aboard the ship as a hostage for the Preacher to personally execute in an upcoming transmission. When more of the Preacher's sermons result in further violent shootings, the Tracker tracks down an impressionist and a film crew, who he uses to create a fake video showing the Preacher exposing himself as a fraud (Ariel having hacked the Preacher's channel). The video has the desired effect: the Preacher is unsettled and attempts to flee, allowing Ariel to follow both him and Opal.

History The erection of a religious higher education institution by the Malays were started since before the independence of Malaya. It is not an easy pathway since the English colonisation is still there in Malaya. Since mass secularisation of Malays were extensively done by the coloniser, the requirement for an Islamic College become increased to preserved the continuance of religious, politics and social of the Muslim Malays. The ideas of an Islamic College were proposed by Za'ba in Al-Ikhwan magazine, 16 January 1927. Za'ba wanted an Islamic College like Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, India.http://studentsrepo.um.edu.my/121/5/BAB2.pdf The founder of the College were Almarhum Maulana Mohamed Abdul Alim Siddiqui and Almarhum Dato' Syed Ibrahim Omar Al-Sagoff. This issue were highlighted by both influential Malay-Islamic political party, UMNO & PAS, also by Melayu Raya newspaper. Meeting between ulamak of Malaya in Muar, Johore(21–22 February 1950) which sponsored by UMNO agreed anonymously of the idea. Committee sponsors of KIM were formed in 20 Mac 1949. Report of The Muslim College Committee were finalised on 19 September 1949. With endorsement from Sultan of Pahang and Selangor don't able to prevent the coloniser from prohibiting the erection of the college. In 1952, Tuanku Abdul Rahman proposed the College to be built in the same route as the missionary schools. Initially, the schools were proposed to be built in Skudai, Johore. The school were built through public-funding. PAS even held a week named \\"Minggu Kolej Islam\\" for funding. It also gain funds from Chinese taikun and Arabic government such as Arab Saudi and Kuwait. The first batch consisted of 58 students with the highest students hailing from Kelantan. There are also two professor from Al-Azhar University. This college was established in 1374 AH/1955 AD and named Kolej Islam Malaya with Tuan Ismail Umar Abdul Aziz as the first headmaster. The College opened its door to female students in 1960. Buildings It was erected on a piece of land measuring approximately located at Jalan Kota Raja, which is about one and a half miles from Klang. The college was initially a palace then benefacted by Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah Al-Haj, son of the late Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah. He hoped that the college would produce scholars who fear Allah, and thus illuminate the society with the spirit of Islam and eliminate all forms of unbelief and ignorance that exist. Relocation In 1386 AH/1966 AD, Highest Certificate of Kolej Islam Malaya was moved to a new building in Petaling Jaya (now Foundation Centre of International Islamic University Malaysia) and then to Bangi (which became the Faculty of Islamic Studies Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia). However, course preparation is still performed in Klang. When Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) has been established, the Islamic Colleges were absorbed into a faculty and upgraded as the Faculty of Islamic Studies. The College preparation in Klang has been taken over by the Ministry of Education in 1967 and was made into a boarding school. The students who excelled in the examination SRP offered to Klang Islamic College. Objectives KIM was established to served as the epitome of higher learning for Muslims youth in Malaya well as in Southeast Asian region.http://studentsrepo.um.edu.my/121/4/BAB1.pdf KIM is a center of higher learning offering Highest Certificate of Islamic Colleges equivalent to a BA Al-Azhar University.

Built in the 1850s to the design of architect Arthur Ashpitel, it provided \\"an important visual and spiritual focus\\" to a rapidly growing high-class residential area. The church has an Evangelical character. There are four services on a Sunday. St John's Blackheath has thriving children's groups and youth groups.http://www.stjohnsblackheath.org.uk/activities/ Their vision is to be A church for all ages, committed to growing in outreach, discipleship and the next generation. History The residential area now known as Vanbrugh Park, east of Greenwich Park and north of the present A2 road, was laid out in the early part of the Victorian era. Architect Arthur Ashpitel from Hackney was commissioned to design a new church for this district, which at the time (prior to the Local Government Act 1888) was in the county of Kent. It was his only new church in Kent, although he restored the medieval building at Ripple. Work began in 1852 and the church was completed in 1853. Some stained glass windows in the north aisle were destroyed during World War II and were subsequently replaced. The interior was altered in 1999; some of the space at the west end was taken up by new facilities such as offices and a kitchen. The church was listed at Grade II on 8 June 1973. English Heritage defines Grade II-listed buildings as \\"nationally important\\" and of \\"special interest\\". The war memorial outside the church, designed by J.B.L. Tolhurst and unveiled on 11 November 1922, was separately listed at Grade II on 19 May 2016. Architecture St John the Evangelist's Church is \\"a local landmark\\" and \\"a focal point\\" in a prominent position: it stands on an island surrounded by roads and housing, and is clearly visible in the streetscape especially from the west. It is built of Kentish Ragstone, a local material, and has a roof of Welsh slate. The plan consists of a nave with aisles on both sides, an aisled chancel with a lower roofline and flanked by a vestry and an organ chamber, porches on two sides, and a tower and the west end. This is topped with a \\"good\\" tall spire whose lowest stage is concealed by a parapet. The tower is buttressed at each corner and has windows with decorative tracery, clock faces, a pinnacled upper stage and a stair turret in one corner. The architectural style is largely Perpendicular Gothic Revival, which was out of fashion by the 1850s, although there are some Decorated Gothic Revival elements. The architect Arthur Ashpitel, who worked extensively in Kent, was associated with Anglican evangelicalism; this may have led him to use the Perpendicular style, which was popular with that movement. Inside, the fittings date mostly from the late 19th century and include a rood screen and reredos by H.S. Rogers. The west-end gallery installed by D. Drury in 1898 was removed during the 1999 reordering. The firm of Heaton, Butler and Bayne designed many of the stained glass windows. Services and administration There are four Sunday services, including a morning Eucharistic service using the Book of Common Prayer. Sunday Services, St John's Blackheath. The Church Pastoral Aid Society holds the patronage of St John the Evangelist's Church. The population of the parish was estimated at 4,962 in 2001.

It is usually made from broken rice, sometimes with the addition of other cereals, and often fortified with micronutrients, including minerals such as iron and zinc and vitamins, such as vitamin A and vitamin B.  Manufacture  Rice-making machines exist that allow broken rice or other ingredients to be shaped into rice-shaped pellets. Rice fortification presents numerous technical problems. Micronutrients cannot be simply added to the kernels, because they do not stay where they are needed and the traditional soaking and rinsing of rice with water prior to cooking removes most of the added nutrients. In the hot extrusion process, rice flour and micronutrients are transformed into a product visually resembling natural rice. Thereby, vitamins and minerals are embedded and protected from segregation and from being removed through rinsing or leaching out during washing and cooking. NutriRice NutriRice is a kind of recomposed fortified rice. The NutriRice process is a way of rice fortification utilized hot extrusion technology not only addresses the problem of hidden hunger but also meets the challenge of implementing rice fortification. The production of NutriRice offers the unique possibility to efficiently fortify rice with multiple micronutrients. Vitamins and minerals such as vitamin A and B family as well as iron and zinc can be chosen for inclusion. Use Most Ultra Rice products are designed for blending with white rice in a ratio of 1:100 and intended to be as close as possible to rice in smell, taste, and texture. It was originally used in Brazil, Colombia, and India, but through a partnership with World Vision the product is slated to be used in many developing countries receiving aid. Research With respect to fortified rice properties, such as wash stability, shelf stability, cooking behavior, visual appearance, and cooked rice texture, hot extrusion can be recommended to produce the fortified rice kernel. The fortified rice kernel through hot extrusion most closely resembles natural rice after cooking. =Dandelion Middle School= The children of 600 migrant workers attend the Dandelion Middle School in Beijing, some of them as resident pupils. In 2008, as part of a pilot project, all pupils at the school were given NutriRice for a period of 8 months. During the eight-month trial period, the effects of malnutrition were reduced by 50%, thus raising the pupils’ general nutritional status to the average urban level. Ultra Rice Ultra Rice is a grain product made to resemble rice and fortified with vitamins and nutrients. Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) developed Ultra Rice as a food supplement for use in countries where people do not have easy access to food which satisfies the nutritional requirements for good health. Manufacture Ultra Rice was developed by Dr. James P. Cox and his wife Jeanne over a course of 20 years, starting in the 1960s while living in Canada. Jim and Jeanne's idea was to utilitize the wasted broken rice grains and produce a nutrition-enhanced instant rice product to fight world hunger. The first criteria for feeding the people was to create a nutritious food that could be identified by the indigenous people. Second, the food should be easy to prepare, even in the crudest method on a dung burner, in less than five minutes, all the while maintaining its integrity as a recognized food. The rice should be fortified with protein and contain vitamins A and D. The process Dr. and Mrs. Cox developed was more expensive to execute than the market value of the product and they eventually transferred their patent for the process to PATH. Ultra Rice was first made generally available in 2005. The grains resemble milled rice grains in size, shape, and color, but actually they are made from rice flour, added nutrients, and ingredients which preserve the nutrients. Use Most Ultra Rice products are designed for blending with white rice in a ratio of 1:100 and intended to be as close as possible to rice in smell, taste, and texture. It was originally used in Brazil, Colombia, and India, but through a partnership with World Vision the product is slated to be used in many developing countries receiving aid. Research Researchers assessed the stability of Ultra Rice's vitamins as the rice is stored; ascorbate, saturated fat and antioxidants were found to be keep the vitamin A intact during storage in high humidity. Another study found that vitamin A losses would stabilize after six months and that the loss of vitamin A during cooking could be predicted. A lack of vitamin A can cause night blindness; a study in 2005 showed that 348 pregnant Nepali women who ate Ultra Rice had improvement in night vision which did not different significantly from the improvement which could come from vitamin A as liver, carrots, capsule, or green leafy vegetables. A ferric pyrophosphate in Ultra Rice was shown in a study involving 180 lactating nonpregnant women in Mexico to reduce iron deficiency anemia rates in the study population by 80% and iron deficiency by 29%. A taste panel has shown that most people cannot differentiate between ordinary rice and Ultra Rice by taste, and various other reports have shown that there is no statistically significant difference of taste preference between Ultra Rice and rice. In a study on 134 children aged 8–11 years old participating in the Indian Mid-day Meal Scheme, 37 assessed the difference between samples and 43 subjects assessed the acceptability of fortified rice. Partners After PATH developed Ultra Rice many other entities began to participate in its manufacture, distributing, and the tracking of its efficacy. Ultra Rice is usually manufactured within the country using it. The Department of Biotechnology (India), Ministry of Agriculture (Brazil), Universidade Federal de Viçosa (Brazil), and the University of Toronto (Canada) contributed to the research and development of the Ultra Rice plan. In India the Akshaya Patra Foundation and the Naandi Foundation implement the Ultra Rice Project. Elsewhere the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, World Vision, and World Food Programme created implementation programs. The Ultra Rice project was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

In India it was mentioned in a case before the high court, but the reports were not confirmed. In December 2016, it was reported that 2.5 tonnes of plastic rice had been seized in Nigeria. A few weeks later, after preliminary tests, a spokesperson of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health stated that the material contained all the characteristics of real rice and there was no evidence that plastic rice was circulating in the country; the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control later announced that the seized rice had been contaminated with bacteria. Fake rice was also reported on social media in the Philippines. In 2017, there were rumours of plastic rice in the Gambia and Ghana, but these rumours were not confirmed. The Ghana Food and Drugs Authority carried out an investigation and found out samples suspected to be fake rice were not real.

This area is named as a combination of \\"photo-\\" referring to light and redox, a condensed expression for the chemical processes of reduction and oxidation. In particular, photoredox catalysis employs small quantities of a light- sensitive compound that, when excited by light, can mediate the transfer of electrons between chemical compounds that would usually not react at all. Photoredox catalysts are generally drawn from three classes of materials: transition-metal complexes, organic dyes, and semiconductors. While organic photoredox catalysts were dominant throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, soluble transition-metal complexes are more commonly used today. Schematic diagram of [Ru(bipy)3]2+, a typical photoredox catalyst Study of this branch of catalysis led to the development of new methods to accomplish known and new chemical transformations. Photoredox catalysts are usually far less toxic than traditional reagents used to generate free radicals, such as organotin compounds. Furthermore, photoredox catalysts generate potent redox agents when exposed to light, they are unreactive under normal conditions. Thus, transition-metal complex photoredox catalysts are more attractive than stoichiometric redox agents such as quinones. The properties of transition- metal photoredox catalysts depend on the ligands and metal and can be modified for different purposes. Photoredox catalysis is often applied to generate known reactive intermediates in a novel way and has led to the discovery of new organic reactions, such as the first direct functionalization of the β-arylation of saturated aldehydes. While the D3-symmetric transition-metal complexes used in many photoredox-catalyzed reactions are chiral, enantioenriched photoredox catalysts has only led to low levels of enantioselectivity in a photoredox-catalyzed aryl-aryl coupling reaction, suggesting that the chiral nature of these catalysts is still poor at transmitting stereochemical information. While synthetically useful levels of enantioselectivity has not been achieved using chiral photoredox catalysts alone, enantioselectivity have been obtained through the synergistic combination of photoredox catalysis with chiral organocatalysts such as secondary amines and Brønsted acids.  Photochemistry of transition metal sensitizers Sensitizers absorb light to give redox-active excited states. For many metal-based sensitizers, excitation is realized as a metal-to-ligand charge transfer, whereby an electron moves from the metal (e.g., a d orbital) to an orbital localized on the ligands (e.g. the π* orbital of an aromatic ligand). The initial excited electronic state relaxes to the lowest energy singlet excited state through internal conversion, a process where energy is dissipated as vibrational energy rather than as electromagnetic radiation. This singlet excited state can relax further by two distinct processes: the catalyst may fluoresce, radiating a photon and returning to the singlet ground state, or it can move to the lowest energy triplet excited state (a state where two unpaired electrons have the same spin) by a second non-radiative process termed intersystem crossing. Direct relaxation of the excited triplet to the ground state, termed phosphorescence, requires both emission of a photon and inversion of the spin of the excited electron. This pathway is slow because it is spin-forbidden so the triplet excited state has a substantial average lifetime. For the common photosensitizer, tris-(2,2’-bipyridyl)ruthenium (abbreviated as [Ru(bipy)3]2+ or [Ru(bpy)3]2+), the lifetime of the triplet excited state is approximately 1100 ns. This lifetime is sufficient for other relaxation pathways (specifically, electron- transfer pathways) to occur before decay of the catalyst to its ground state. Jablonski diagram illustrating the electronic states accessible during photoexcitation. Note: ISC stands for Intersystem Crossing. E0,0 is a measurement of the energy gap between the ground state and the lowest energy triplet state. This parameter is proportional to the phosphorescence wavelength and is used to compute the redox potentials of the triplet state. The long-lived triplet excited state accessible by photoexcitation is both a more potent reducing agent and a more potent oxidizing agent than the ground state of the catalyst. Since sensitizer is coordinatively saturated, electron transfer must occur by an outer sphere process, where the electron tunnels between the catalyst and the substrate.  Outer sphere electron transfer  Marcus' theory of outer sphere electron transfer predicts that such a tunneling process will occur most quickly in systems where the electron transfer is thermodynamically favorable (i.e. between strong reductants and oxidants) and where the electron transfer has a low intrinsic barrier. The intrinsic barrier of electron transfer derives from the Franck–Condon principle, stating that electronic transition takes place more quickly given greater overlap between the initial and final electronic states. Interpreted loosely, this principle suggests that the barrier of an electronic transition is related to the degree to which the system seeks to reorganize. For an electronic transition with a system, the barrier is related to the \\"overlap\\" between the initial and final wave functions of the excited electron–i.e. the degree to which the electron needs to \\"move\\" in the transition. In an intermolecular electron transfer, a similar role is played by the degree to which the nuclei seek to move in response to the change in their new electronic environment. Immediately after electron transfer, the nuclear arrangement of the molecule, previously an equilibrium, now represents a vibrationally excited state and must relax to its new equilibrium geometry. Rigid systems, whose geometry is not greatly dependent on oxidation state, therefore experience less vibrational excitation during electron transfer, and have a lower intrinsic barrier. Photocatalysts such as [Ru(bipy)3]2+, are held in a rigid arrangement by flat, bidentate ligands arranged in an octahedral geometry around the metal center. Therefore, the complex does not undergo much reorganization during electron transfer. Since electron transfer of these complexes is fast, it is likely to take place within the duration of the catalyst's active state, i.e. during the lifetime of the triplet excited state. center  Catalyst regeneration  The final step in the photocatalytic cycle is the regeneration of the photocatalyst in its ground state. At this stage, the catalyst exists as the ground state of either its oxidized or reduced forms, depending on whether it donated or accepted an electron. These oxidation states have a strong driving force to return to their equilibrium oxidation state and act as a potent single-electron reductant or oxidant to satisfy that driving force. To regenerate the original ground state, the catalyst must participate in a second outer-sphere electron transfer. In many cases, this electron transfer takes place with a stoichiometric two-electron reductant or oxidant, although in some cases this step involves a second reagent. The reductive quenching cycle is when the excited state catalyst is first reduced then oxidized to return to its resting state. Conversely, the oxidative quenching cycle is when the excited state catalyst is first oxidized and then reduced to return to its resting state. These two cycles can be distinguished by a Stern–Volmer experiment. Since the electron transfer step of the catalytic cycle takes place from the triplet excited state, it competes with phosphorescence as a relaxation pathway. The Stern–Volmer experiment measures the intensity of phosphorescence while varying the concentration of each possible quenching agent. When the concentration of the actual quenching agent is varied, the rate of electron transfer and the degree of phosphorescence is affected. This relationship is modeled by the equation: \\\\left ( \\\\frac{I_0}{I} \\\\right ) = 1 + {k_q} * {\\\\tau_0} \\\\times [ Q ] Here, I0 and I denote the emission intensity with and without quenching agent present, kq the rate constant of the quenching process, τ0 the excited-state lifetime in the absence of quenching agent and [Q] the concentration of quenching agent. Thus, if the excited-state lifetime of the photoredox catalyst is known from other experiments, the rate constant of quenching in the presence of a single reaction component can be determined by measuring the change in emission intensity as the concentration of quenching agent changes.  Photophysical properties   Redox potentials  The redox potentials of photoredox catalysts must be matched to the reaction's other components. While ground state redox potentials are easily measured by cyclic voltammetry or other electrochemical methods, measuring the redox potential of an electronically excited state cannot be accomplished directly by these methods. However, two methods exist that allow estimation of the excited-state redox potentials and one method exists for the direct measurement of these potentials. To estimate the excited-state redox potentials, one method is to compare the rates of electron transfer from the excited state to a series of ground-state reactants whose redox potentials are known. A more common method to estimate these potentials is to use an equation developed by Rehm and Weller that describes the excited-state potentials as a correction of the ground-state potentials: {{E^*}_{1/2}}^{red} = {E_{1/2}}^{red} + E_{0,0} + w_r {{E^*}_{1/2}}^{ox} = {E_{1/2}}^{ox} - E_{0,0} + w_r In these formulas, E*1/2 represents the reduction or oxidation potential of the excited state, E1/2 represents the reduction or oxidation potential of the ground state, E0,0 represents the difference in energy between the zeroth vibrational states of the ground and excited states and wr represents the work function, an electrostatic interaction that arises due to the separation of charges that occurs during electron-transfer between two chemical species. The zero-zero excitation energy, E0,0 is usually approximated by the corresponding transition in the fluorescence spectrum. This method allows calculation of approximate excited-state redox potentials from more easily measured ground-state redox potentials and spectroscopic data. Direct measurement of the excited-state redox potentials is possible by applying a method known as phase-modulated voltammetry. This method works by shining light onto an electrochemical cell in order to generate the desired excited-state species, but to modulate the intensity of the light sinusoidally, so that the concentration of the excited-state species is not constant. In fact, the concentration of excited-state species in the cell should change exactly in phase with the intensity of light incident on the electrochemical cell. If the potential applied to the cell is strong enough for electron transfer to occur, the change in concentration of the redox- competent excited state can be measured as an alternating current (AC). Furthermore, the phase shift of the AC current relative to the intensity of the incident light corresponds to the average lifetime of an excited-state species before it engages in electron transfer. Charts of redox potentials for the most common photoredox catalysts are available for quick access.  Ligand electronegativity  The relative reducing and oxidizing natures of these photocatalysts can be understood by considering the ligands' electronegativity and the catalyst complex's metal center. More electronegative metals and ligands can stabilize electrons better than their less electronegative counterparts. Therefore, complexes with more electronegative ligands are more oxidising than less electronegative ligand complexes. For example, the ligands 2,2'-bipyridine and 2,2'-phenylpyridine are isoelectronic structures, containing the same number and arrangement of electrons. Phenylpyridine replaces one of the nitrogen atoms in bipyridine with a carbon atom. Carbon is less electronegative than nitrogen is, so it holds electrons less tightly. Since the remainder of the ligand molecule is identical and phenylpyridine holds electrons less tightly than bipyridine, it is more strongly electron-donating and less electronegative as a ligand. Hence, complexes with phenylpyridine ligands are more strongly reducing and less strongly oxidizing than equivalent complexes with bipyridine ligands. Similarly, a fluorinated phenylpyridine ligand is more electronegative than phenylpyridine so complexes with fluorine-containing ligands are more strongly oxidizing and less strongly reducing than equivalent unsubstituted phenylpyridine complexes. The metal center's electronic influence on the complex is more complex than the ligand effect. According to the Pauling scale of electronegativity, both ruthenium and iridium have an electronegativity of 2.2. If this was the sole factor relevant to redox potentials, then complexes of ruthenium and iridium with the same ligands should be equally powerful photoredox catalysts. However, considering the Rehm-Weller equation, the spectroscopic properties of the metal play a role in determining the redox properties of the excited state. In particular, the parameter E0,0 is related to the emission wavelength of the complex and therefore, to the size of the Stokes shift - the difference in energy between the maximum absorption and emission of a molecule. Typically, ruthenium complexes have large Stokes shifts and hence, low energy emission wavelengths and small zero-zero excitation energies when compared to iridium complexes. In effect, while ground-state ruthenium complexes can be potent reductants, the excited-state complex is a far less potent reductant or oxidant than its equivalent iridium complex. This makes iridium preferred for the development of general organic transformations because the stronger redox potentials of the excited catalyst allows the use of weaker stoichiometric reductants and oxidants or the use of less reactive substrates.  Applications   Reductive dehalogenation  Reductive dehalogenation is the removing of halogen atoms from a molecule. However, the traditional method for dehalogenation uses stoichiometric organotin reagents, such as tributyltin hydride. While this reaction is powerful with high functional group tolerance, organotin reagents are highly toxic. The cleavage of activated and reductively labile functional groups including sulfoniums and halogens is the earliest application of photoredox catalysis to organic synthesis, but early attempts were limited by the need for specific substrates or by the formation of dimeric coupling products. More general methods are known. One method employs [Ru(bipy)3]2+ as the photocatalyst and a stoichiometric amine reductant to reduce \\"activated\\" carbon-halogen bonds, such as those with an adjacent carbonyl group or arene. These bonds are considered to be activated because the radical they produce upon fragmentation is stabilized by conjugation with the carbonyl group or arene, respectively. The stoichiometric reductant present in this reaction transfers an electron to reduce the excited-state catalyst to the Ru(I) oxidation state. The reduced catalyst then shuttles the transferred electron to the halogenated substrate, reducing the weak C-X bond and inducing fragmentation. Diagram of the catalytic cycle proposed for the mechanism of their tin-free reduction of activated halogens Unactivated carbon-iodine bonds can be reduced using the strongly reducing photocatalyst tris-(2,2’-phenylpyridine)iridium (Ir(ppy)3). This reaction is mechanistically distinct from the previous transformation of activated bromides and chlorides. The increased reduction potential of Ir(ppy)3 compared to [Ru(bipy)3]2+ allows direct reduction of the carbon-iodine bond without interacting with a stoichiometric reductant. Thus, the iridium complex transfers an electron to the substrate, causing fragmentation of the substrate and oxidizing the catalyst to the Ir(IV) oxidation state. The oxidized photocatalyst is returned to its original oxidation state by oxidising a reaction additives. Mechanistic diagram of the reductive dehalogenation of unactivated carbon-iodine bonds Like tin-mediated radical dehalogenation reactions, photocatalytic reductive dehalogenation can be used to initiate cascade cyclizations to rapidly generate molecular complexity. In this work, a radical cascade cyclization that closed two five-membered rings and formed two new stereocenters, in good yield. This reductive dehalogenation protocol was a key step in a total synthesis of the natural product (+)-Gliocladin C. Diagram of a radical cascade cyclization initiated by a photoredox-catalyzed reductive dehalogenation reaction. b) Diagram of a radical fragment coupling initiated by a photoredox-catalyzed reductive dehalogenation reaction. This reaction was used in the synthesis of the natural product (+)-Gliocladin C  Oxidative generation of iminium ions  Iminium ions are potent electrophiles useful for generating C-N bonds in complex molecules. However, the condensation of amines with carbonyl compounds to form iminium ions is often unfavorable, sometimes requiring harsh dehydrating conditions. Thus, alternative methods for iminium ion generation, particularly by oxidation from the corresponding amine, are a valuable synthesis tool. Iminium ions can be generated from activated amines using Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2PF6 as a photoredox catalyst. This transformation is proposed to occur by oxidation of the amine to the aminium radical cation by the excited photocatalyst. This is followed by hydrogen atom transfer to a superstoichimetric oxidant, such as trichloromethyl radical (CCl3 to form the iminium ion). The iminium ion is then quenched by reaction with a nucleophile. Related transformations of amines with a wide variety of other nucleophiles have been investigated, such as cyanide (Strecker reaction), silyl enol ethers (Mannich reaction), dialkylphosphates, allyl silanes (aza-Sakurai reaction), indoles (Friedel-Crafts reaction), and copper acetylides. Photocatalytic generation and functionalization of iminium ions Similar photoredox generation of iminium ions has furthermore been achieved using purely organic photoredox catalysts, such as Rose Bengal and Eosin Y. Two organic dyes used in photoredox catalysis An asymmetric variant of this reaction utilizes acyl nucleophile equivalents generated by N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis. This reaction method sidesteps the problem of poor enantioinduction from chiral photoredox catalysts by moving the source of enantioselectivity to the N-heterocyclic carbene. Carbene Catalyst used in alpha-acylation of amines  Oxidative generation of oxocarbenium ions  The development of orthogonal protecting groups is a problem in organic synthesis because these protecting groups allow each instance of a common functional group, such as the hydroxyl group, to be distinguished during the synthesis of a complex molecule. A very common protecting group for the hydroxyl functional group is the para-methoxy benzyl (PMB) ether. This protecting group is chemically similar to the less electron-rich benzyl ether. Typically, selective cleavage of a PMB ether in the presence of a benzyl ether uses strong stoichiometric oxidants such as 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) or ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN). PMB ethers are far more susceptible to oxidation than benzyl ethers since they are more electron-rich. The selective deprotection of PMB ethers can be achieved through the use of bis-(2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)-5-trifluoromethylpyridine)-(4,4'-ditertbutylbipyridine)iridium(III) hexafluorophosphate (Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6) and a mild stoichiometric oxidant such as bromotrichloromethane, BrCCl3. The photoexcited iridium catalyst is reducing enough to fragment the bromotrichloromethane to form a trichloromethyl radical, bromide anion, and the Ir(IV) complex. The electron- poor fluorinated ligands makes the iridium complex oxidising enough to accept an electron from an electron-rich arene such as a PMB ether. After the arene is oxidized, it will readily participate in hydrogen atom transfer with trichloromethyl radical to form chloroform and an oxocarbenium ion, which is readily hydrolyzed to reveal the free hydroxide. This reaction was demonstrated to be orthogonal to many common protecting groups when a base was added to neutralise the HBr produced. Photoredox-catalyzed PMB deprotection  Cycloadditions  Cycloadditions and other pericyclic reactions are powerful transforms in organic synthesis because of their potential to rapidly generate complex molecular architectures and particularly because of their capacity to set multiple adjacent stereocenters in a highly controlled manner. However, only certain cycloadditions are allowed under thermal conditions according to the Woodward–Hoffmann rules of orbital symmetry, or other equivalent models such as frontier molecular orbital theory (FMO) or the Dewar-Zimmermann model. Cycloadditions that are not thermally allowed, such as the [2+2] cycloaddition, can be enabled by photochemical activation of the reaction. Under uncatalyzed conditions, this activation requires the use of high energy ultraviolet light capable of altering the orbital populations of the reactive compounds. Alternatively, metal catalysts such as cobalt and copper have been reported to catalyze thermally-forbidden [2+2] cycloadditions via single electron transfer. Diagram of Photocatalytic Crossed Enone 2+2 cycloaddition The required change in orbital populations can be achieved by electron transfer with a photocatalyst sensitive to lower energy visible light. Yoon demonstrated the efficient intra- and intermolecular [2+2] cycloadditions of activated olefins: particularly enones and styrenes. Enones, or electron-poor olefins, were discovered to react via a radical-anion pathway, utilizing diisopropylethylamine as a transient source of electrons. For this electron-transfer, [Ru(bipy)3]2+ was discovered to be an efficient photocatalyst. The anionic nature of the cyclization proved to be crucial: performing the reaction in acid rather than with a lithium counterion favored a non-cycloaddition pathway. Zhao et al. likewise discovered that a still different cyclization pathway is available to chalcones with a samarium counterion. Conversely, electron-rich styrenes were found to react via a radical-cation mechanism, utilizing methyl viologen or molecular oxygen as a transient electron sink. While [Ru(bipy)3]2+ proved to be a competent catalyst for intramolecular cyclizations using methyl viologen, it could not be used with molecular oxygen as an electron sink or for intermolecular cyclizations. For intermolecular cyclizations, Yoon et al. discovered that the more strongly oxidizing photocatalyst [Ru(bpm)3]2+ and molecular oxygen provided a catalytic system better suited to access the radical cation necessary for the cycloaddition to occur. [Ru(bpz)3]2+, a still more strongly oxidizing photocatalyst, proved to be problematic because although it could catalyze the desired [2+2] cycloaddition, it was also strong enough to oxidize the cycloadduct and catalyze the retro-[2+2] reaction. This comparison of photocatalysts highlights the importance of tuning the redox properties of a photocatalyst to the reaction system as well as demonstrating the value of polypyridyl compounds as ligands, due to the ease with which they can be modified to adjust the redox properties of their complexes. Diagram of Photocatalytic Crossed Styrene 2+2 Cycloaddition Photoredox-catalyzed [2+2] cycloadditions can also be effected with a triphenylpyrylium organic photoredox catalyst. Triphenylpyrylium Photoredox catalyst In addition to the thermally-forbidden [2+2] cycloaddition, photoredox catalysis can be applied to the [4+2] cyclization (Diels–Alder reaction). Bis-enones, similar to the substrates used for the photoredox [2+2] cyclization, but with a longer linker joining the two enone functional groups, undergo intramolecular radical-anion hetero-Diels–Alder reactions more rapidly than [2+2] cycloaddition. Diagram of Photocatalytic bis-enone hetero-Diels–Alder reaction Similarly, electron-rich styrenes participate in intra- or intermolecular Diels–Alder cyclizations via a radical cation mechanism. [Ru(bipy)3]2+ was a competent catalyst for intermolecular, but not intramolecular, Diels–Alder cyclizations. This photoredox-catalyzed Diels–Alder reaction allows cycloaddition between two electronically mismatched substrates. The normal electronic demand for the Diels–Alder reaction calls for an electron-rich diene to react with an electron-poor olefin (or \\"dienophile\\"), while the inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction takes place between the opposite case of an electron-poor diene and a very electron-rich dienophile. The photoredox case, since it takes place by a different mechanism than the thermal Diels–Alder reaction, allows cycloaddition between an electron-rich diene and an electron-rich dienophile, allowing access to new classes of Diels–Alder adducts. Diagram of Photocatalytic styrene Diels–Alder reaction The synthetic value of Yoon's photoredox-catalyzed styrene Diels–Alder reaction was demonstrated via the total synthesis of the natural product Heitziamide A. This synthesis demonstrates that the thermal Diels–Alder reaction favors the undesired regioisomer, but the photoredox-catalyzed reaction gives the desired regioisomer in improved yield. Key photoredox cycloaddition in total synthesis of Heitziamide A  Photoredox organocatalysis  Organocatalysis is a subfield of catalysis that explores the potential of organic small molecules as catalysts, particularly for the enantioselective creation of chiral molecules. One strategy in this subfield is the use of chiral secondary amines to activate carbonyl compounds. In this case, amine condensation with the carbonyl compound generates a nucleophilic enamine. The chiral amine is designed so that one face of the enamine is sterically shielded and so that only the unshielded face is free to react. Despite the power of this approach to catalyze the enantioselective functionalization of carbonyl compounds, certain valuable transformations, such as the catalytic enantioselective α-alkylation of aldehydes, remained elusive. The combination of organocatalysis and photoredox methods provides a catalytic solution to this problem. In this approach for the α-alkylation of aldehydes, [Ru(bipy)3]2+ reductively fragments an activated alkyl halide, such as bromomalonate or phenacyl bromide, which can then add to catalytically-generated enamine in an enantioselective manner. The oxidized photocatalyst then oxidatively quenches the resulting α-amino radical to form an iminium ion, which hydrolyzes to give the functionalized carbonyl compound. This photoredox transformation was shown to be mechanistically distinct from another organocatalytic radical process termed singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) catalysis. SOMO catalysis employs superstoichiometric ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) to oxidize the catalytically-generated enamine to the corresponding radical cation, which can then add to a suitable coupling partner such as allyl silane. This type of mechanism is excluded for the photocatalytic alkylation reaction because whereas enamine radical cation was observed to cyclize onto pendant olefins and open cyclopropane radical clocks in SOMO catalysis, these structures were unreactive in the photoredox reaction. Diagram of Enantioselective Alkylation of Aldehydes via the synergistic combination of organo- and photoredox catalysis This transformation include alkylations with other classes of activated alkyl halides of synthetic interest. In particular, the use of the photocatalyst Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2+ allows the enantioselective α-trifluoromethylation of aldehydes while the use of Ir(ppy)3 allowed the enantioselective coupling of aldehydes with electron-poor benzylic bromides. Zeitler et al. also investigated the productive merger of photoredox and organocatalytic methods to achieve enantioselective alkylation of aldehydes. The same chiral imidazolidinone organocatalyst was used to form enamine and introduce chirality. However, the organic photoredox catalyst Eosin Y was used rather than a ruthenium or iridium complex. Direct β-arylation of saturated aldehydes and ketones can be effected through the combination of photoredox and organocatalytic methods. The previous method to accomplish direct β-functionalization of a saturated carbonyl consists of a one-pot consists of a two-step process, both catalyzed by a secondary amine organocatalyst: stoichiometric reduction of an aldehyde with IBX followed by addition of an activated alkyl nucleophile to the beta-position of the resulting enal. This transformation, which like other photoredox processes takes place by a radical mechanism, is limited to the addition of highly electrophilic arenes to the beta position. The severe limitations on the arene component scope in this reaction is due primarily to the need for an arene radical anion that is stable enough not to react directly with enamine or enamine radical cation. In the proposed mechanism, the activated photoredox catalyst is quenched oxidatively by an electron-deficient arene, such as 1,4-dicyanobenzene. The photocatalyst then oxidizes an enamine species, transiently generated by the condensation of an aldehyde with a secondary amine cocatalyst, such as the optimal isopropyl benzylamine. The resulting enamine radical cation usually reacts as a 3 π-electron system, but due to the stability of the radical coupling partners, deprotonation of the β-methylene position gives rise to a 5 π-electron system with strong radical character at the newly accessed β-carbon. Although this reaction relies on the use of a secondary amine organocatalyst to generate the enamine species which is oxidized in the proposed mechanism, no enantioselective variant of this reaction exists. Diagram of Photoredox beta-arylation of aldehydes The development of this direct β-arylation of aldehydes led to related reactions for the β-functionalization of cyclic ketones. In particular, β-arylation of cyclic ketones has been achieved under similar reaction conditions, but using azepane as the secondary amine cocatalyst. A photocatalytic \\"homo-aldol\\" reaction works for cyclic ketones, allowing the coupling of the beta-position of the ketone to the ipso carbon of aryl ketones, such as benzophenone and acetophenone. In addition to the azepane cocatalyst, this reaction requires the use of the more strongly reducing photoredox catalyst Ir(ppy)3 and the addition of lithium hexafluoroarsenide (LiAsF6) to promote single-electron reduction of the aryl ketone. Additions to olefins The use of photoredox catalysis to generate reactive heteroatom-centered radicals was first explored in the 1990s. [Ru(bipy)3]2+ was found to catalyze the fragmentation of tosylphenylselenide to phenylselenolate anion and tosyl radical and that a radical chain propagation mechanism allowed the addition of tosyl radical and phenylseleno- radical across the double bond of electron rich alkyl vinyl ethers. Since phenylselenolate anion is readily oxidized to diphenyldiselenide, the low quantities of diphenyldiselenide observed was taken as an indication that photoredox-catalyzed fragmentation of tosylphenylselenide was only important as an initiation step, and that most of the reactivity was due to a radical chain process. Addition of Tosylphenylselenide across an olefin Heteroaromatic additions to olefins include multicomponent oxy- and aminotrifluoromethylation reactions. These reactions use Umemoto's reagent, a sulfonium salt that serves as an electrophilic source of the trifluoromethyl group and that is precedented to react via a single-electron transfer pathway. Thus, single-electron reduction of Umemoto's reagent releases trifluoromethyl radical, which adds to the reactive olefin. Subsequently, single-electron oxidation of the alkyl radical generated by this addition produces a cation which can be trapped by water, an alcohol, or a nitrile. In order to achieve high levels of regioselectivity, this reactivity has been explored mainly for styrenes, which are biased towards formation of the benzylic radical intermediate. Photoredox-catalyzed oxy- and aminotrifluoromethylation Hydrotrifluoromethylation of styrenes and aliphatic alkenes can be effected with a mesityl acridinium organic photoredox catalyst and Langlois' reagent as the source of CF3 radical. In this reaction, it was found that trifluoroethanol and substoichiometric amounts of an aromatic thiol, such as methyl thiosalicylate, employed in tandem served as the best source of hydrogen radical to complete the catalytic cycle. Diagram of two reagents for olefin hydrotrifluoromethylation Intramolecular hydroetherifications and hydroaminations proceed with anti-Markovnikov selectivity. One mechanism invokes the single-electron oxidation of the olefin, trapping the radical cation by a pendant hydroxyl or amine functional group, and quenching the resulting alkyl radical by H-atom transfer from a highly labile donor species. Extensions of this reactivity to intermolecular systems have resulted in i) a new synthetic route to complex tetrahydrofurans by a \\"polar-radical-crossover cycloaddition\\" (PRCC reaction) of an allylic alcohol with an olefin, and ii) the anti-Markovnikov addition of carboxylic acids to olefins.

In the same vein, while responding to greater environmental problems such as water pollution, post-mining activities, natural risks, atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration, waste management, environmental remediation and developing a climate of measurement systems and information, the BRGM adopted the signature, Géosciences pour une Terre durable (\\"\\") on 14 January 2003.Community Trade Mark No. 3007705 Search according to number, on the site Institut national de la propriété industrielle; Search in CTM-ONLINE on the site . Then, in 2004, the abbreviation, BRGM, became official.Article 2, decree No. 2004-991 of 20 September 2004 which modified the decree No. 59-1205 of 23 October 1959 relating to the financial and administrative management of the Bureau de recherches géologiques et minières, JORF No. 221 of 22 September 2004, p. 16400, text No. 3, MENK0401779D, on Légifrance. The BRGM undertakes an in-house development of its method of governance, its quality assurance controls (including quality edits and environmental responsibility) by shaping its tasks, skills and funding to the evolutions of the establishment. This is also coordinated with its international scientific partners (81 projects carried out over the 2009-2012 period), including the promotion of international networks.

Mergers highlighted the chairmanship of Roland Pré. These led to a re- organization of the BRGM. From 1960 to 1962, the BRGM assumed a large proportion of the employees of federal departments of mines and geology of French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa, and in 1961, a large part of the activities and personnel of the Department of Geological Surveys and Mines, French Guiana. Under the chairmanship of Pierre Signard, Roland Pré's successor, a technical and scientific center was established at in 1965. This center was useful in unifying all the BRGM teams. He also continued the re- organization of the BRGM. In January 1968, the Geological Maps Office of France and in 1970, the Alsace-Lorraine Geological Survey (SGAL) came under the BRGM's umbrella. Under the management of Claude Beaumont, the term «» (SGN, en: National Geological Service) was introduced in the mining code. He appointed Claude Guillemin as Director of the SGN. It was also under his chairmanship that the BRGM took an international focus; notably the signing of a contract with the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources of Saudi Arabia in 1964 to undertake a geologic and mining reconnaissance of the country. A Petroleum and mineral resources crisis arose in 1973 and under the chairmanship of Yves Perrin, the BRGM expanded significantly while carrying out its task of supplying energy and minerals to France. This development placed the BRGM amongst the leading global petrol and mineral explorers. The Geothermy department was then created as a response to the need for renewable energy. In 1977, the subsidiary COFRAMINE was created in order to consolidate mining companies with BRGM shareholdings. Jean Audibert's term of office was marked by the global crisis and the quite depressed market for minerals and metals. Due to its inability to obtain sufficient financing, most of the mining projects were slowed down or abandoned, many were often sold to international mining groups, notably, Portuguese Neves-Corvo's copper and tin deposit that was sold to RTZ. This field is one of the biggest in Europe. Geothermal energy was developed in conjunction with the (AFME, English: Agency for Energy Management, France), an agency that was established in 1982. The (CFG, English: French Geothermal energy company) was established in 1984. On the other hand, at the initiative of the Ministry of Research, especially of Hubert Curien, a close acquaintance of Claude Guillemin, scientific activities were centered around a few big projects. Finally, in 1985, a department of research was created. Also, Gérard Renon placed more focus on the commercial services activities of the BRGM. When a department (named the \\"4S\\" in 1987) regrouping the teams working in both soil and subsoil management was created, a better separation of tasks was established. Its main objective was to geographically redeploy the commercial activities of the BRGM. The operational cost cutting crisis whereby it had to close several departments (geothermal energy, mineralogy, geotechnical department etcetera) came to an end in 1988 and was followed by a financial recovery. A policy of service activities development and labor cost-cutting measures were introduced by Maurice Allègre. In 1990, its service activities became mature and thereby, eighty (80) persons were employed. On the other hand, mining activities were still on a stalemate. The chairmanship of Claude Allègre was notable for its strategic restructuring plan that was spearheaded by Jean-Pierre Hugon. The research and public-sector missions, along with the commercial and mining activities services, would eventually become subsidiaries. Engineering and consulting activities were handed over to the in 1994. In the field of mining, the BRGM in association with Normandy, an Australian group, created the la Source Compagnie minière (SAS). This subsidiary was concerned with a major part of BRGM's mining activities. It was in the midst of these events that the court case dubbed (English: the Yanacocha gold mine case) sprang up. This gold mine was discovered in 1980 by BRGM but was being exploited by an association comprising both local industries, North American companies and the BRGM. A legal complication ensured and the BRGM's right to the mine was lost to its associates even when the reserves in the discovered mine were important. In some ways, the chairmanship of Bernard Cabaret which took off with a formalization of the policies of business reforms which were not different from his predecessors. In fact, a decree published in 1998 placed the BRGM under the dual auspices of the Ministry of Research and the Ministry of Industry. This brought mining investments by the BRGM to an end and thereafter, the la Source Compagnie minière (SAS) was dissolved. Later, when the was sold in 2003, all service activities came to an end. Thereafter, the BRGM was confined to the singular task of \\"National Geological Service\\" and had to reorient its focus towards the environment and natural risks. Research on geological storage of CO was launched. With Yves Caristan as Executive Director, a forecasting department was opened in 2001 and its first defining contract was signed with the French state detailing a four-year mission and major policies. This practice was continued in 2005 and 2009. The BRGM acquired a new logo: (English: Geosciences for a Sustainable Earth). The BRGM was now included amongst the industries that were under the jurisdiction of \\"page 187 of the (LOLF, English: organic laws relating to Finance laws)\\" of which the Institut national de la recherche agronomique (INRA, English: National Institute for Agronomic Research), the Institut de recherche pour l'ingénierie de l'agriculture et de l'environnement (CEMAGREF, English: National Institute for Research in Science and Technology related to Agriculture and the Environment), the Centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement (CIRAD, English: Center for International Cooperation for Developmental Agronomic Research), the (IFREMER, English: French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) and the Institut de recherche pour le développement (IRD, English: Institute for Developmental Research). The appointment of Philippe Vesseron was marked, at the beginning of his tenure, by a modification of the decree formalizing new thematic directions of the BRGM by placing it under the supervision of the Ministry of Research, Industry and the Environment in 2004. Following the dissolution of the Charbonnages de France, as well as other public-sector mining companies (Iron, Potassium, etc.), the BRGM inherited and managed their old mining sites, but it had lost its capacity of developing mines. Then arose another fuel crisis and the geothermal energy department was reopened, thereby ensuring that the missions, respectively, of the CFG and the Géothermie Bouillante were sorted out. At the end of the year 2009, at the commencement of Jean-François Rocchi's tenure as chairman and chief executive, a new modification its establishing decree was concurrently carried out. made the BRGM responsible for establishing a school for applied Geosciences, the (ENAG).ENAG official website In 2010, the Ministry responsible for sustainable development, which supervision includes that of the \\"Environment\\" and \\"Mines\\" of the BRGM, announced a relaunch of the mining policy on strategic metals. At the middle of the year 2012, Jean-François Rocchi, whose tenure was short, reorganized the scientific functions of the BRGM with the aim of improving the definition of its missions and greatly improving its effectiveness(French text) Annual report of the BRGM. 2012. by setting up six (6) operational departments (against the former ten (10)) along with a science and production directorate.  Objectives and missions  The objectives of the BRGM include understanding and identifying geological phenomena in order to develop adequate and responsive techniques to the environmental difficulties encountered in managing the soil, the subsoil, French mineral resources, post- mining safety, natural risks, soil pollution and climatic change.Quadrennial contract BRGM 2009-2012 , on its website. Septembre 2009. It also provides higher education through its school of engineering, the ENAG.Ministerial order of November 24, 2009, on the Ecole nationale d'applications des géosciences (National School of Applied Geosciences), JORF on Légifrance website (in French). Other principal objectives are to make scientific data publicly available, as well as methodologies and tools that will increase the understanding and management of the problems resulting from global warming and policies of territorial development. Its activities and actions are determined by the (CNOSP, English: National Public Service Steering Committee), an umbrella body for various French ministerial departments. The outlines of this ministerial convergence were designed in 2001 through a quadrennial (4-year) program. Co-funding is provided to BRGM from the French Regional Council as well as the European Union (EU). Agencies with similar objectives as the BRGM, such as the Agence nationale de la recherche (ANR, English: National Agency for Research) or the (ADEME, English: Environment and Energy Management Agency) form partnerships with the BRGM. It is also one of the 33 members of the .\\"Les instituts Carnot\\", on the website of the \\"Instituts Carnot\\". According to the last four-year program of the BRGM, its basic objectives are: * Applied scientific research in the fields of soil science and the sub-soil. * Support for public policies through expertise assessment, monitoring and expert studies. * International cooperation. * Along with the (ADEME, English: Environment and Energy Management Agency) and , (DREAL, English: Regional Directorate for Environment, Development and Housing), the BRGM contributes to the mining and industrial legacies of the country (298 records of mining concessions have been digitized between 2009 and 2012). In the domain of post- mining, it monitors old French mining sites and post-mining activities carried out by the (DPSM, English: Mining Safety Department) and four (4) (UATM, English: Post-mining Territorial units), located at Billy-Montigny, Freyming- Merlebach, Orléans and Gardanne. In the area of post-mining, the BRGM has developed a methodology for management of the risk of coal mine methane (firedamp) release at the surface from old mining sites. * Knowledge capitalization and distribution. * Monitoring transfers into the industry that could result in geo-strategic problems (with respect to rare metals/elements or those that are used in the military or civilian nuclear industry) and questions of environmental ethics (legal and illegal gold prospecting that are facilitated by the distribution of information on known deposits), including in French Guiana, where the BRGM joined in 2011 (through its regional office) a business cluster called that was created in 2010 and registered as Délégation interministérielle à l'aménagement du territoire et à l'attractivité régionale (DATAR, English; Interministerial Delegation for Territorial Development and Regional Attractiveness). * Organizing training involving both continuous education and the (ENAG, English: National Institute for Applied Geosciences). This training was started in 2010 and corresponds to 6 years of higher education. The first class was made of twelve (12) students while the second fourteen (14), with three (3) part-time students. Dominique Guyonnet presides over the school which offers sixteen (16) months of studies (six (6) on internship) on sustainable mineral resources management. The ENAG, in October 2001, signed an agreement with the (IFREMER, English: French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea), the (IUEM, English: European Institute for Marine Studies) and the Service hydrographique et océanographique de la marine (SHOM, English: Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service) concerning oceanographic exploration. The quadrennial program \\"\\" made the BRGM responsible for geological and mining sciences, institutional and collective expertise (with defined code of ethics) while providing answers to the challenges of mineral resources (securing supplies, training, etc.) and to sustainable development through improving responses to global changes (restoring and preserving groundwater, preventing geologic risks, securing the development of geological storage of CO, development through geothermal diversification, identification of aquifer resources) of which 14 out of 20 surveys have been completed. During this period, the BRGM has notably finalised the first pilot exploitation of geothermal heating using a technology called EGS (Enhanced Geothermal System). It has also developed a unified method of evaluating seismic vulnerability and an issue tracking systems. During 2009 to 2012, forty-eight percent (48%) of the activities of the regional offices was about water, but in certain areas, mining risks and/or industrial risks were the cause of concern, notably in the Provence- Alpes-Côte-d'Azur (also known as PACA) regions where a platform for understanding major risksThe term \\"Major risks\\" was defined on the site was established on 4 July 2012 and also in French Guiana where a research on climate change in French Guiana for the years 2030 and 2050 was simulated with the , (DREAL, English: Regional Directorate for Environment, Development and Housing) and (ADEME, English: Environment and Energy Management Agency).  Monitoring and forecasting BRGM's mission statement is composed of three parts: monitoring, forecasting and economic intelligence. It fulfils this responsibility by the publication of the following reviews for the benefit of its supervising ministry: the Ecomine (published since 1980); the (AS3M) or also known as \\"World Mining and Metals Yearbook\\"On the BRGM infoterre portal which first edition appeared eighty (80) years ago. This yearbook monitors eighteen (18) metals by country and is published in association with Société de l'industrie minérale (SIM, English: Mineral Industry Association) The BRGM is also a part of the (COMES, English: Strategic Metals Committee). The COMES was established by decree of 26 January 2011 and is focused on four (4) working groups which were formed in March 2011, namely for: # The Identification and evaluation of the needs of French Industries. # The Marine and Land natural resources that can be exploited. # Development of savings in raw materials and recyclable products. # Transnational aspects as regards strategic metals. The BRGM serves as the vice-chairman of groups 1 and 2. Therefore, it has signed an agreement with ERAMET and Renault. It also monitors the changes in the known and reported resources, including resources that have to be recycled like gallium, germanium, niobium, rare-earth elements, beryllium, molybdenum, rhenium, selenium, tellurium, antimony, lithium, tantalum, graphite, and tungsten. Parts of these reports have been published and publicly available.For example The Econmine review Plans for the future are carried out through forecasting exercises, namely \\"BRGM Vision 2030\\" and mapping the network of its partners.  Areas of expertise  The areas of expertise of the BRGM is evident in ten (10) fields of activities(French text) The BRGM in brief. , presentation of the activity domains of the BRGM.  Geology  As a \\"Service géologique national\\" (English: National geological service), the BRGM puts its expertise to work in improving geological knowledge concerning the soil and subsoils. It produces and disseminates geological information on the subsoil and surface features, through its research programs and geological and geophysical field studies for the benefit of governments, developers, manufacturers, and teachers, in France and globally. It has established databases, paper-based and digital geological maps as well as 3D models, which are applicable in the management of water and mineral resources, for prevention of natural risks, in combating land pollution, for developing soil and subsoils, in the geological storage of CO gas, the valorisation of French geological heritage, as well as other uses. = Geological maps = The geological maps provides information to the general public on the nature of the rocks and geological faults which can be found in the subsoil of a region or a country. Brief history: A need for a geological map of France goes back in time to a decree promulgated by Napoleon III, dated the First of October 1868, which established the \\"Service de la carte géologique de la France et des topographies souterraines\\" (English: The geologic map of France and groundwater topography service). The earliest geologic maps date back to 1664 (by ) and 1746 (by Jean-Étienne Guettard). Since 1794, the Corps des mines have been responsible for drawing up geological maps. Jean Baptiste Julien d'Omalius d'Halloy sketched the geology of the Parisian basin and it environs in 1816, scaling the map at 1/800 000. Ours-Pierre-Armand Petit-Dufrénoy and Jean-Baptiste Élie de Beaumont, who were both mining engineers, were charged with the task of drawing up the first French geological map in 1841, using a scale of 1 / 500 000. The decree promulgated by Napoleon III on the First of October 1868 at Biarritz made it clear that the task of drawing up a French geological map would be done at the state's expense, thereby centralizing the task to the state, at least, where it concerns coordinating the surveyors and the publishing. Using its powers, the service undertook the work of bringing to light a geological map, using a scale of 1/80 000, which work was accomplished in 1925, about fifty (50) years later. It produced 268 maps. It continued until 1971 because it was publishing successive editions (about 600 sheets published). At the same time, another French geological surveying program, begun in 1913, was in place and it used a scale of 1/50 000. This mapping program produced 1060 maps of Metropolitan France. Its first sheets were published in 1925. In 1967, it released 148 maps when the decree of 22 December 1967 charged the BRGM with the task of drawing up the French geological map. Article 1 of the decree in fact mentions the geologic map: \\"In order to make knowledge of the subsoil available in a form that is adapted to the needs of users\\" and article 2 makes the BRGM responsible for: \\"facilitation, coordination and implementation of all necessary work for the establishment of the general geologic map\\", as well as: \\"publication, printing and distribution of these maps and all accompanying texts.\\" Current situation: This cartographic program also led to the publication of several works at the scale of 1/1 000 000 comprising several editions of the French map for the years 1889, 1905, 1933, 1955, 1968, 1996 and 2003 and at the scale of 1/250 000; these latter had incomplete coverage. Since 2000, graphical images of scanned geological base maps using a scale of 1/50 000 has been a subject for national harmonization and is freely available to the public on the site. This map can be seen as planar projections of intersection of geological formations with surface topography. The intersection geometry and the geological characteristics of the formations allow for an extrapolation of the volumes of rocks in three dimensions with depths that vary with the scale and density of the data, along with the degree of information. Pictures of the subsoil are often accompanied by very complex interpretations which rules took more than a century and a half to set: from the appearance of the first geological maps at the beginning of the nineteenth century, notably Georges Cuvier and 's cartography of the tertiary basins of Paris. Currently available in more than 25 000 copies each year, the geological maps of France is an essential starting point on the geology of French territory and makes the management of risks, pollutions, water resources, and major developmental works possible. The traditional geologic maps are gradually enriched with data concerning surface and oil drilling, seismic data and also airborne geophysical data. The 2011 geological map, the most current as of writing, is scaled at 1/50 000° and is made of 1060 collected maps and often contains old data. The last version took geologists sixty (60) years to complete. Along with the \\"banque de données du sous-sol\\" (BSS, literally: Subsoil database), this map is the defining point for mining and geologic know-how on France and is accessible on the iPhone through an app that can calculate ground profiles and do virtual drilling. Development: Although this maps are heterogeneous, they are often incoherent. They can contain obsolete information derived almost exclusively from the surface, while industrialists and scientists are increasingly in need of constantly updated 3D numerical models describing, in depth, the geological layers and geological functions, hydrogeological, seismic, thermal and other functions.BRGM (2012), Activity report for 2011, p 31. Already, the BRGM has released the initial 3D geometrical representation of the French subsoil which includes chemical and physical parameters. It plans to switch over to a 3D digital model of geological maps. Therefore, these are the days of the \\"French Geological system of reference.\\" A \\"3D airborne\\" geophysical map for the overseas departments was begun at Mayotte,Project GEOMAYOTTE; SIG La lettre (2010), Géomayotte - 14/10/2010: GéoMayotte, A mapping project from BRGM for the development of Mayotte in 2011. Also, a follow-up project for groundwater monitoring and detection of organic contaminants (projects ORIGAMI and REMANTAS and project TIC EuroGEOSS). Project IEED GOEODENERGIES deals with technology of the subsoil for carbon-free energy or PLAT’INN (démonstrateur- plateforme de tri et recyclage de déchets comme source d’approvisionnement en métaux stratégiques, English: platform for demonstration of sorting and recycling of waste as a source of strategic metals) or Greenerb@t whose subject matter is the construction of more ecological and smarter buildings. Also, the BRGM is a participant in the IEE \\"Intelligent Energy-Europe program with the seventh PCERD along with geothermal energy development and other programs, such as: LABEX and EQUIPEX, the CARNOT (, English: Research Program for Technology and Industries) program of which IRSTEA (Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies pour l'environnement et l'agriculture, English: National Institute for Science and Technology Research for the Environment and Agriculture) is noteworthy, and the IFREMER-EDROME program, as well the . The Carnot label was given it by the Ministry of Research in 2012, covers every institute which is concerned with research and development for economic development. As of writing, there are thirty-four (34) institutes so labelled. Finally, the CVT (, English: Thematic Enhancement Consortium) by the Allenvi (, English: National Alliance for Environmental Research) alliance. = The French geological reference = New established geological references have been modernised through analytical methods and new information such as those from airborne geophysics that is based on radiometry and the earth's magnetism. These information are available on the Internet. They are supposed to incorporate thematic maps such as lithological maps, minerals, temporal maps etc. through principal geographic information systems (GIS) (e.g. ArcGIS, ArcGIS Server) For this purpose, the RGF (, English: French geological reference) program was launched in 2011. The development of this new reference work was meant to be collaborative, inter-university and eventually, multinational and should take several decades. = \\"InfoTerre\\" catalogue = This catalogue has been publicly available on Infoterre. Since 2011, a map of regolith, a 3D diapir model of the Dax community in the Aquitaine region, new French Guiana(BSS) data, and the Upper Rhine Graben. These are maps of geothermal potential and temperature for areas which are interesting for the storage of CO gas. Studies have also been conducted for the hazard mapping of asbestos at four (4) levels (1/125000 ° et 1/30 000° mappings) in the natural environment, making complete every available data for Upper Corsica, Loire-Atlantique and Savoie.  Mineral resources  The BRGM seeks the knowledge and control of mineral raw materials through: * Knowledge of mineralization and models of formation of deposits, deposits identification, and characterization of resources and reserves. * Economic and environmental impact of exploitations. * Materials life cycle analysis. * Knowledge of French mineral resources and current operations. In 2011, the database of material operations were more than 100 000 in Meteropolitan France, French overseas departments and overseas collectivities as was described by the materials observatory.Materials observatory 4690 active quarries are listed of which 2745 produce aggregates. Since 2011, the \\"national mining inventory\\" is reviewed and updated in order to facilitate the identification of strategic mineral resources, the test area bordering the Cévennes region and its old mine at Pallières, La Croix with zinc, lead and other minerals like germanium and also in the Gard region. *In Africa, the BRGM coordinates the Pan-African mapping of mineral resources, geothermal and ground water through the AEGOS ( African GeoResources European observation system) observatory which brings together 23 partners, the GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems) project, in connection with various research programs such as MIRECA, GECO and TRACE. Its aim is to develop local governance through taking a better account of the preservation of cultural heritage threatened by artisanal mining, enabling traceability of minerals by their mineralogical footprint (from the source to the factory) as well as throughout the commercial certification chain, notably coltan and diamonds. Strategic metals and minerals from uranium (Katanga, for example) have received enhanced research and mapping pressures. * Resources for historical monuments. The \\"Monumat\\" database was constructed by the BRGM with the (LRMH, English: Historical monuments research laboratory). It collects information on some monuments and by the end of 2011, on about 6900 different stones and quarries available for the restoration of historical monuments, both in France and Réunion. * Economic intelligence and mining expertise. = Worldwide deposits = 800px { class=\\"wikitable center\\" !

He was an Associate of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts He attended Westminster school and is reported to have briefly been at Oxford. He published the first of his 36 books, mostly on railway subjects, at the age of 21. During 1940 Ellis was sent to Switzerland by MI6 under the guise of reporting for Modern Transport to organise saboteurs, but is reported not to have made contact with his handlers. Ellis covered a broad range of railway subjects in his books, the best-known of which is The Trains we Loved (Allen & Unwin, 1947). His obituarist in The Times commented that his Railway Carriages in the British Isles from 1830 to 1914 (1965, revised from an earlier book) \\"despite its near-obsession with matters lavatorial and ablutory ... was an epoch-making work\\". As a knowledgeable railwayman he appeared in the 1968 TV documentary 4472: Flying Scotsman and appeared twice in the BBC TV game show Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? in railway themed episodes. He also wrote a small number of novels, such as The Engineer-Corporal (1940) and Dandy Hart (1947). Both of which were fictional, somewhat \\"voluble [and] long winded\\", and deeply based on an interest in railway operations, which was also assumed in the reader. He had an interest in model railways: his 1962 book Model Railways 1838-1939 was said by The Times to have \\"led the way in charting the early history of this ... hobby\\". He was an early member and for some time Vice- President of the Historical Model Railway Society. His 1959 humorous book Rapidly Round the Bend was described as \\"[doing] for railways what Sellers and Yeatman had done for general history\\" (a reference to the authors of 1066 and All That).

Work  Werner Pawlok started his first studio in 1977 as a self-taught photographer. In the same year he became a tutor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart. Crying Monkey, 1992 © Werner Pawlok In 1984 he became the first western photographer to work officially in East- Germany with East-German models. He collaborated with the Fashion Designer Helmut Lang on the project \\"Fashion in East-Berlin\\" published in magazines such as Wiener and Style & the family tunes. In 1985 Kodak commissioned Pawlok for the series \\"Around the World in 40 days\\" shown at the 1986 photokina, Cologne in a solo exhibition. In 1988 he started working with the Polaroid 20×24-inch camera and moved to TriBeCa in New York City to work on his art projects. In the same year he invented the transfer technique using the 20×24 Polaroid Camera to start his series \\"Photography Paintings\\". With this series Werner Pawlok emphasizes his intention to dispel the traditional categorisation separating photography from painting. The concept of the shots aims to evoke the style of European classical portrait painting but without imitating or even quoting it. In the same year Gunter Sachs became one of Pawlok's first collectors. Also in 1988 Werner Pawlok photographed Leigh Bowery, an Australian performance artist. Following on, in 1989, was the \\"Transfers\\" series. From Pawlok's experimental handling of processes, techniques and image carrier media emerges a pictorial style that doesn't need visual reference within reality. With \\"Transfers\\", the photographer becomes a painter. Faces and flowers are the most prevalent subjects. A large format Polaroid, which is transferred through a complex process to a heavy, rough- textured hand made paper or canvas, produces the image. The calculated exchange of the photochemical layer simultaneously combining with the amalgam of coincidence. Here, Pawlok is a painter and alchemist at the same time. Due to their so thoroughly induced metamorphoses into a new and singular pictorial space, the results of this manipulation could easily be named transmutations. Within the peculiar profundity these works radiate, the developing process seems to continue to have an effect. Their materiality reminds one of an artistic principle of modernity which doesn't make use of pictorial means solely in order to express, but elevates them to be the purpose themselves. Pawlok´s unique Polaroids became part of the Polaroid Collection.http://www.photography-now.com/exhibition/details/75496 In 1990 he began with his cycle \\"Stars & Paints\\" a series of one hundred 20×24-inch unique Polaroids of celebrities including Sir Peter Ustinov, John Malkovich, Roman Polanski, Dizzy Gillespie, Jean Paul Gaultier, Juliette Binoche and Jane Birkin. The desire to be someone else lights up the star-cult of our times. The step from the juggler on the ramp of a medieval fairground booth to the hype of the media world is much smaller than expected. The idea is ingenious and perfidious at the same time: They, the Stars, have engaged in this game, they slipped over on the banana skin that was handed to them. They can be given credit for this, the Stars, the real ones, because the memory of the, should we say, precarious origin of their prominence is still alive within the best. Maybe it is even the pleasure of a hide-and-seek game that tempts these people, whom we admire so much, to engage in the set that Werner Pawlok provides and that drives Pedro Almodóvar, director and connoisseur of the women, to \\"quote himself\\" or that causes John Malkovich, the ghost-lighting chameleon amongst the Hollywood actors, to reveal parts of his innermost self in front of this seemingly archaic camera. There is one image within the series, a self-portrait of the initiators of the project, in which some waggishness seems to be sparkling out of the picture. We, the viewers possibly benefit from a secret agreement between both the photographer and photographed person, which knows about the fragility of success on stage. In May 1992 Edition Domberger, published under the patronage of King Juan Carlos of Spain, and documenta IX, the edition COLUMBUS - IN SEARCH OF A NEW TOMORROW, featured the work of 37 artists including Joseph Beuys, Max Bill, Sandro Chia, Eduardo Chillida, Christo, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Longo, Antonio Tàpies and more. Werner Pawlok was part of the project with his Crying Monkey, portraying a monkey in a crucified position on golden leaves. In 1993 Werner Pawlok completed the series \\"Crying Animals\\" photographed with the 20×24 Polaroid camera. Also in 1992 Mercedes-Benz commissioned Pawlok to photograph their collection of classic cars, icons of motoring including the unique Silver Arrows racing cars driven by the likes of Fangio and Moss. For this, his \\"Master Pieces\\" series, he again used the 20×24 Polaroid camera, transferring the Polaroid negative film onto canvas and thus creating an impression similar to painting. In 1996 he started with the cycle of images named \\"Dantes Commedia\\", an interpretation of Dante Aligheri's Divina Commedia or Divine Comedy. The first time that Werner Pawlok produced a full series, of 33 pictures, using digital imaging. He does not illustrate the selected cantos, he rather conceptualises visionary image metaphors which reflect Dante's verses with a resolute gesture but still develop their own vocabulary. Dante's Inferno is cone shaped. On Pawloks transparent Cibachrome the image appears boosted, dynamic: a fervent maelstrom has seized its personnel and keeps it banished; on the other hand, the Catharsis Mountain exudes an ethereal fluidity which reminds us of the path of light which the poet walks on in his phantastic journey. Pawloks version is not trying to comment on the verses but seeks creative inspiration, an associative method that leads to precise image settings, which add themselves to an open series without joining a cohesive cycle. In 2000 he traveled Europe to photograph the project Stars for UNICEF, portraits of European Stars such as Ewan McGregor, Patricia Kaas, Andrzej Wajda, Nacho Duato and more. 2001 Pawlok participated in the exhibition tour Images beyond the Naked Eye, together with Duane Michals, Robert Lebeck, Sarah Moon, Sebastião Salgado and others. 2002 Pawlok started his portrait cycle of \\"Views - Faces of Literature\\", a series of writers like, Martin Walser, T.C. Boyle, Henning Mankell, Amos Oz, Jonathan Franzen, Richard Ford, Salman Rushdie, Ian Rankin, Ken Follett, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Ian McEwan, Michael Ondaatje, Siri Hustvedt, Leon de Winter, Jeffrey Eugenides and more. At the Kaufleuten, probably the best-known club in Zurich, readings of contemporary writers from all over the world are a part of its program. There is limited time for Werner Pawlok and his project. It is always the same installation, a ring-flash and the camera with a Polaroid film. Always the same light too, which meets different ages, vistas and facial landscapes. Pawlok explains the procedure to Jonathan Franzen: Only two shots, pressing the release twice. One of the portraits is for the author, the other one becomes part of Pawlok's contemporary writers series. A distance of only twenty centimeters separates the author and the camera. What does the face reveal of this life? The reactions towards the portraying situation vary: from easygoing to superior, and open but also irritated by this close look that searches for the way inside. \\"You are not going to look into my soul\\", Franzen says arranging his glasses like a shield. 2004 and 2013 he travels to Cuba to photograph for his series \\"Cuba - expired\\". In his pictures Werner Pawlok tells about the morbid charm of an old Caribbean metropolis, showing a part of history by themselves. The splendour and misery of the Cuban utopia, the projector cubano, melt together so obviously in these abandoned palaces of the old sugar-aristocracy. Pawlok tracks this sunken world during his rambles through Havana.

Mills, Adrian Room, The Oxford Names Companion, OUP, 2002, p.141, Part of the medieval keep at Moreton Corbet. The castle was a serious fortification for a dynasty of Marcher Lords but was turned into a more comfortable family home by Sir Andrew Corbet in the 16th century. Robert Corbet (1383–1420) of Moreton Corbet, Shropshire, was an English soldier, politician and landowner who represented Shropshire twice in the House of Commons of England. A retainer of Thomas FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel, and implicated in his alleged misrule in Shropshire, he accompanied his patron to the Siege of Harfleur and suffered a temporary eclipse after his death. Background and early life Robert Corbet was the eldest son of:Grazebrook and Rylands, p.135 :*Sir Roger Corbet of Moreton Corbet. The Corbet family had been important in the Welsh Marches since the Norman Conquest.Grazebrook and Rylands, p.133 With the extinction of the Corbet line at Caus Castle in 1347, its properties had passed to Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford,Baugh and Elrington (1989), Domesday Book: 1300–1540 leaving the cadet branch, at Moreton Corbet Castle, the leading branch of the family in Shropshire. As a third son, Sir Roger had been compelled to fight a series of legal actions to prevent his family property slipping away.Roskell et al, CORBET, Sir Roger (d.1395), of Moreton Corbet, Salop. – Author: L. S. Woodger :*Margaret Erdington, daughter of Sir Giles Erdington of Erdington, Warwickshire. The marriage of Roger Corbet and Margaret Erdington was one part of a double link between the families, as Margaret Corbet and Sir Thomas Erdington, their siblings, also married. The Erdingtons also became embroiled in the Corbets' property disputes. Robert Corbet was born on 8 December 1383 at Moreton Corbet. His father and mother died within a few months of each other, still fairly young, in 1395. Robert was not yet 12 – well below the age of majority. The most powerful magnate in the county was Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel and he would normally have had a strong claim to Corbet's wardship.Roskell et al, CORBET, Robert (1383–1420), of Moreton Corbet, Salop. – Author: L. S. Woodger However, Arundel was one of the Lords Appellant, who had opposed Richard II's policies and favourites. As Corbet's wardship became available, the king was moving against Arundel and his allies, and he was arrested on 12 July 1397, to face attainder and execution on 21 September. In October 1397 Corbet's marriage and wardship were granted to Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester.Corbet, p.243 Although he had been ennobled by Richard II, Percy was one of those nobles who helped depose him in 1399, installing as king Henry IV. However, Henry was particularly dependent on support from the Arundels, particularly the executed earl's brother, Thomas Arundel, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his son, Thomas FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel. Thus he compelled Worcester to cede the wardship of Corbet to John Burley, a Shropshire MP and a retainer of the young earl. The growing alienation of Worcester from the king came to a head in 1403, when he was publicly executed after the Battle of Shrewsbury. Corbet, meanwhile, was on the winning side, as part of the Arundel faction, although there is no evidence that he fought in the battle. Landowner Corbet was able to prove his majority and take control of the family estates in 1405. At about the same time, he was able to pledge his allegiance to Henry IV personally at Stafford. An inquisition of 1406, presumably related to Corbet's taking livery of his estates, lists some of the properties that had been in his mother's hands at her death. :Shawbury Manor, Moreton Corbet Manor, Chatewyn Manor, Upton Waters Manor, Tireleye Manor, Messuages and lands in Ivelith near Shiffenhale Lauleye (Lawley) Manor, as of the Manor of Hynstok, Blecheleye Vill, Stoke Manor, Culsey Manor, as of the Manor of Tirleye, Bouleye super Hyneheth (Booley upon Hine Heath) Vill, Ronton Vill, Ambaston Vill, six messuages in Withiford Co Salop and the Marches of Wales. Shrewsbury Abbey today. Only part of the great medieval monastery survives as Holy Cross parish church. Corbet's property transactions took place generally within Arundel's retinue. In 1407 he and his younger brother, Roger, John Darras, their aunt Joan's husband, and William Ryman of Sussex – all Arundel allies – obtained a licence from the king to grant a burgage called Ireland Hall in Shrewsbury to Shrewsbury Abbey. The grant was to support works of piety and was probably on Arundel's behalf. In 1413 Corbet enlisted the help of William Burley, John Burley's son and a future Speaker,Roskell et al, BURLEY, William (d.1458), of Broncroft in Corvedale, Salop. – Authors: J.S. Roskell/L.S. Woodger to entail the manor of Shawbury. He obtained royal permission to enfeoff Burley and a group of associates with the estate, entailing it on himself, his wife, Margaret, and their descendants. In September 1419 he acquired a considerable number of estates in Shropshire from Roger Thornes of Shelvock Manor. Thornes was a notable lawyer who had served as borough attorney for Shrewsbury.Roskell et al, THORNES, Roger, of Shrewsbury and Shelvock, Salop. – Author: L.S. Woodger For reasons which remain mysterious, he disposed of his ancestral estates as soon as he had fully inherited them, apparently settling for those he had acquired by his own efforts and through inheritance by his wife, Cecily Young. Political and military career Robert Corbet and his younger brother, Roger, enlisted in the service of the Earl of Arundel in 1405. For a decade, most of their public and political interventions closely followed the policies and interests of the Earl. Corbet was made a Justice of the Peace for Shropshire in 1410. In the same year he attended the election of Arundel's supporters, David Holbache and John Burley as knights of the shire at Shrewsbury Castle. In March 1413, after Henry V succeeded to the throne and Arundel had been promoted to Lord Treasurer he was himself elected to Parliament for the first time. The other member was Richard Lacon,Roskell et al, Shropshire – Author: L.S. Woodger who was married to Corbet's cousin, and had profited materially from his closeness to Arundel and the House of Lancaster.Roskell et al, LACON, Richard (d.c.1446), of Lacon and Willey, Salop. – Author: L.S. Woodger This marked the zenith of Arundel's dominance in Shropshire, which largely excluded representation of other magnates. The MPs for Shrewsbury were Holbache and Urian St. Pierre, and these joined with Corbet and Lacon to act as mainpernors in Chancery for Matthew ap Meredith, guaranteeing his good conduct, while the parliament was still in session. The triumph of Arundel was soon followed by a furious reaction, led by John Talbot, Lord Furnival, the future Earl of Shrewsbury. Talbot's resentment became so threatening that he was sent to the Tower of London for a time in November and both he and Arundel were made to put up large guarantees of good conduct. Corbet was not a member of the next parliament, the Fire and Faggot Parliament, which was held in Leicester. However, he featured prominently in many of the complaints made there against Arundel's rule in Shropshire. It was alleged that taxes approved by the May 1413 parliament could not be collected in the county because he and Lacon had fallen out with the tax collectors they had themselves recommended. The collectors had been attacked with swords at Moreton Corbet by servants of Robert and Roger Corbet. When they stayed at Oldbury, just south of Bridgnorth, an armed force of 120 came down from the town after them. They had lost employees and horses, and barely escaped with their own lives. In response to the complaints, the king himself presided over the Court of King's Bench at Shrewsbury in Trinity term, the summer session. Arundel's men faced a litany of charges, the most serious being that they had organised a raid on Much Wenlock on 18 May 1413, employing an armed force of 2,000 from Cheshire. The prior of Wenlock Priory complained that these were armed Welshmen, who had destroyed a mill: he could obtain no redress from Arundel. All of the accused were charged with breaking the law on livery. The cases were not decided at that point but transferred to the Michaelmas term session of the King's Bench at Westminster. Corbet had the reasonable excuse that he was actually at Parliament when the worst offences occurred. The accused argued that they were simply intervening in Wenlock as justices of the Peace, enforcing the law against malefactors, including Talbot. Arundel put up bail and sureties, and used his influence to obtain pardons for his retainers. In August 1415, Corbet accompanied Arundel to Normandy as part of the king's resumption of the Hundred Years' War. Arundel fell ill at the Siege of Harfleur and was allowed to return to England. On 4 October Corbet was also allowed to return. However, Arundel died on 13 October, leaving Corbet unprotected in his disputes. At the 1415 parliament he was accused of another catalogue of assaults on tax collectors, general commotions and threats against complainants, in association with his brother,Corbet, p.246-8 but the matter seems to have gone no further. However, he was removed from the Shropshire bench in 1416. He was still under a cloud early in 1419, when he was ordered to appear before the king's council, if required, under threat of a £100 fine. However, he was never summoned. Corbet seems to have crept back into favour, although the precise reasons are unknown; possibly his offences were fading from memory. He was elected to the Commons again later in 1419. He was second to William Burley, who had established good connections with Talbot, while continuing to serve the Arundel estate. It is possible Corbet had done the same: he had a family relationship with Talbot through the Barons Strange of Blackmere. He was then pricked High Sheriff of Shropshire, a considerable honour in the royal gift, and signifying full rehabilitation. However, he died during his shrievalty. Death The family historian, Augusta Corbet, writing towards the end of World War I, considered that Corbet survived until 1438–40,Corbet, p.248 with his son and heir, Thomas, predeceasing him.Corbet, family tree facing p.368 This accords quite well with the date given in the heraldic visitation: 17 Henry VI. However, more recent accounts place his death on 12 August 1420. The difference is related to a problem in identifying Corbet's wife and her history. Marriage and family The earlier sources identify Corbet's wife as Margaret Mallory,Corbet, p.245 daughter of William Mallory, whom Corbet associates with a landowner prominent in Rutland and Cambridgeshire. It now seems that Corbet's identification of William was correct, but he was actually Margaret's second husband. Hence, she became Margaret Mallory only on remarriage, after Corbet's death. Her original name is not given. Robert and Margaret Corbet had two sons, Thomas and Roger, both later MPs for Shropshire. Thomas, the elder son, died without issue and the Corbet line at Moreton was continued by Roger. Corbet also mentions three daughters: Elizabeth, Dorothea and Mary. Margaret married Sir William Mallory of Papworth St. Agnes (a parish that lay mainly in Cambridgeshire, although the Mallory family resided in the small portion of it then within Huntingdonshire) and had by him a further son called Thomas. Mallory has been an elusive figure, partly because he shares his name with a contemporary who was knight of the shire for Leicestershire in 1419.Roskell et al, MALLORY, William, of Walton-on-the-Wolds and Saddington, Leics. – Author: L.S. Woodger Their son is a still more curious figure, qualified by his name, at least, as a candidate for identification with the poet Thomas Malory, author of Le Morte d'Arthur. A letter from A.T. Martin making just such an identification appeared in the Athenaeum in September 1897Athenaeum 11 September 1897, p.353 in the July–December omnibus edition, accessed at Internet Archive, 11 December 2013. and was taken seriously for some time by editors of Malory, including the very scholarly Alfred W. Pollard.A.W. Pollard: Le morte Darthur, p.vi, Macmillan, 1903.

Function  microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

In 1849, it became Bremen's chamber of commerce. Since 1973, it has been under monument protection. It lies on the south site of the Bremen marketplaces directly across from the town hall.  Name  Merchants' guildhalls named \\"Schütting\\" exist or have existed also in Bergen (Norway), there called Scotting, and in Lübeck, Lüneburg, Oldenburg (since 1604), Osnabrück and Rostock. They did not only serve administrative tasks and social events, but also as accommodation for foreign merchants. Therefore, the name can be related to the German word schützen meaning \\"to protect\\".  Locality and politics  The Bremish merchants' coat of arms above the entrance The first guild houses of the merchants were former private houses. In 1425, the aldermen purchased a house in Langenstraße on the corner with Hakenstraße. But in 1410, the town hall of Bremen at the market square had been finished, and the eldermen preferred to be as present at that square as the city senate. Therefore, in 1444, they sold the house in the Langenstraße and bought another one, situated between the lower end of the market square (opposite of the town hall) and river Balge, a branch of the Weser. That guid house was already on the site of present-day Schütting. The year 1451 saw a re-organization of the board of the merchants of Bremen. The relations between the merchants were regularised by a treaty named “Ordinantie”, dated 10 January 1451. Until 1849, the organisation bore the name of “Collegium Seniorum”. Thereafter, it changed its name to Bremer Handelskammer (Bremen chamber of commerce). In 1513, the ground of the Schütting was enlarged by the purchase of five adjacent small buildings. In 1532, there was a rebellion of the lower classes against the dominance of the big merchants in the city of Bremen, called \\"uprise of the 104 men\\". The assembly of the 104 forced the merchants guild to leave all its property, including their guild house, to the public. But already in late summer of that year, the rebellion collapsed, and after the restitution of the old order, the eldermen were stronger than before.  Building history  The western gable from 1537/38 with elements of Late Gothic style The Schütting in 1641 Modest design since 1756, lithograph from 1830 In 1547, the merchants of Bremen charged the Flemish mason and architect Johann den Buschener from Antwerp, who constructed a new building in 1538/39. Due to financial limits, the fine design of the façades lasted much longer. Buschener only completed the stepped western gable, which is on the borderline of Late Gothic and of Renaissance style, and the main entrance, which was not yet central. The eastern gable, pure Renaissance, was crafted in 1565 by a local mason named Karsten Husmann. In 1594, the cornice overlooking the market square was enhanced by a magnificent maritime gable. Lüder von Bentheim, the architect of the Renaissance refresher of the townhall, was engaged in it, too. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the façade was altered several times: In 1756, Theophilus Freese removed the decentral entrance by a decent central one and reduced the number of horizontal cornices, thus changing the style to a modest kind of Baroque. In mid 19th century the line of low shops in front of the basement was removed, and for the first time a twin staircase to the entrance door was built. In Wilhelminism, people disliked the noble modesty of the building. In 1895 to 1899, the number of corniches was raised and above the windows relief ornaments were placed. The present bombastic portal was constructed. Above the door, a Low German inscription was added, lately invented by Bremen's mayor Otto Gildemeister ::buten un binnen ::wagen un winnen (literally \\"Outside and in, risk it and win\\") was added as a motto, meaning that merchants from Bremen are called upon to risk their assets at home and abroad in order to gain fortune. The motto was created by mayor Otto Gildemeister. The building with its magnificent interior and its valuable furnishings burnt to the ground on 6 October 1944. Reconstruction was completed in 1956. Except for the dormers on the façade overlooking the market square, the exterior was rebuilt, as it had been since 1899, while the interior was reconfigured. In 1951, the chamber of commerce moved into the ground floor. The second stage of the reconstruction took place over the next five years, including the second floor interior. In 2009, the façade and copper-covered roof were repaired and the dormers were rebuilt. The firm which performed the work received an award in 2010 from the Landesamt für Denkmalspflege (State of Bremen office for the preservation of monuments and historic buildings).

By August 4, the goal was met, and contributions had reached $25,852. The band initially promised a delivery date of February 2013, but communicated in a backers-only update on the 13th of that month that the album would be delayed because the band members wanted to write a few more songs. On July 5 another update went out revealing that the album was complete, and on October 31 the band said that although they were releasing with Tooth & Nail Records the following January, backers would receive the album digitally in November. The first download link was sent on November 27, 2013. The first backer update regarding CD/DVD/poster/T-shirt packages was sent on January 13, 2014, indicating that they would be sent \\"very soon\\". On March 18, another update was posted acknowledging that the packages had not yet been sent, indicating that it was due to the DVD process not yet having been finished. On December 12, 2014, a backer update was posted saying that the packages would be sent the following January. However, radio silence continued until March 5, 2015, where Jeff sent another update apologizing for no one having received their rewards and being \\"ashamed at how long this has taken\\" but promising to release them \\"ASAP\\". The last communication through Kickstarter was on November 9, 2015, where a final apology was made. Throughout this process, many backers expressed increasing frustration with the state of affairs, some going as far as to suggest taking legal actions against the band. Others tried to take a direct approach by messaging Jeff through various social media outlets, and on April 26, 2016, a backer posted that they had received their reward package, making it three years and eight months since the project was funded.

Three new members are hazed at first, one of them falls in love, and the choir's leader, in preparation for a television appearance, rehearses the troupe so much they revolt. The movie was initially unsuccessful but has gained in popularity. The choir's leader is based on real-life composer, arranger, and music director of the Nahal troupe, Yair Rosenblum. The film was directed by Avi Nesher. Plot The film takes place in Israel 1968 during the War of Attrition. An army entertainment troupe (based on the Nahal troupe), perform comedy and singing acts to the Israeli soldiers in combat zones to boost morale. At the beginning of the film, three departing members of the troupe perform an old Broadway-style song. The next day, auditions, led by the director Paul Aviv (Tuvia Tzafir) are held for the three new members. The three chosen members are the forward Giora Datner (Gidi Gov), the nerdy Jerry Lewis-type Bazooka (Meir Suissa), and the beautifully talented Noa (Dafana Armoni). As part of the welcome wagon, the veteran members give the new recruits the silent treatment by playing practical jokes on them. During a rehearsal, Leicht, the assistant musical director randomly gives Noa a solo that the troupe's prima donna member, Yaffa (Smadar Brenner), initially sings. As Noa amazes everyone in the rehearsal hall, Yaffa storms out of the room. When Datner and Bazooka learn about the new recruit welcome wagon tradition, they decide to get revenge by playing practical jokes back on the veteran troupe members. On their first performance, Yaffa and the troupe's shorty male diva Doron receive electric shocks when touching wet microphones, Shuka, the drummer gets his drums destroyed, Moni, the keyboard player gets powder puffing out of his keyboard, and the audience find it to be hilarious, thinking it was part of the act. The next day, Doron with Moni and Shuka spread dog poop all over Datner's bus seat. When Datner sees the messy seat, he faints. After the seat is cleaned, he suddenly winks at Moni's girlfriend and featured soloist Micki (Liron Nirgad), who begins to have a secret liking for him. The bus brings the troupe from show to show, making stops at cafes in between. Along the journey, the troupe's male lead singer Dani (Sassi Kesshet) and Yaffa's girlfriend, the commander Moti (Doval'e Glickman) both have a love for Noa, which initially causes them to feud. The timid Bazooka gets a crush on Dani's girlfriend, Orli (Chelli Goldenberg), while Datner gives Bazooka lessons on how to develop relationships. The morning following another show, Datner and Bazooka perform another prank on the veteran members by putting themselves in harnesses in a bathroom pretending they committed suicide. As the veteran members' see the 2 members hung, they are met with horror. However at a certain cue, Datner and Bazooka begin to start yelling freaking everyone in the bathroom out. Following a performance at an Israeli Independence day party, Datner continues to help shy Bazooka with his relationship lessons by hooking him up with two girls, who later are seen as drunk and begin raping Bazooka. He escapes by jumping of a window knocking over a table of food. Meanwhile, Datner and Micki begin to start a secret romance for each other. It is revealed when Datner dumps two cakes on the faces of Doron and Moni and run off with her. Moni calls off the relationship with Micki. The next day on the way to a performance, Moti makes an announcement that the troupe will be performing on national television. His announcement causes the troupe to burst into excitement. Later that evening before the performance, Noa is given another solo causing Yaffa to become even more angry at Moti calling off their relationship. Later during the performance, a part of the scenery begins to fall nearly hitting Noa. Hearing about the fiasco that have been happening with the troupe, Alron, the commanding officer puts them under a strict 48-hour boot camp rehearsal to prepare for the television performance. He warns them that any funny business will cause a major reduction in the troupe. At the rehearsal, Aviv pushes the troupe really hard by having them try to learn a new song in just 24 hours and having them repeatedly start from the top when a member is off on his or her singing. Later on, Micki becomes extremely tired during a dance rehearsal. Aviv warns her to follow his every command tired or not. Micki refuses to listen and tries to leave but Aviv abruptly grabs her. Just then, Micki pulls a cup of yogurt from Aviv's table and dumps it all over his face, screams at him, and storms out of the rehearsal hall. Because of her behavior, Aviv and Moti put Micki on trial sentencing her to 30 days on probation and a transfer to another army base. Upset by the departure of one of the best members and his girlfriend, an angry Datner rebels out and leads the entire troupe in a strike against Aviv until Micki is brought back. Aviv refuses and heads out to Alron's office to tell him about the fiasco. Outraged, Alron punishes the entire troupe by announcing that the television appearance is cancelled, and the members will be sent to new army bases. The Troupe is over. Meanwhile, at a lineup to their new bases, Zami, the troupe's electrician stops the moving by dumping two cups of yogurt on himself exclaiming to Aviv, \\"It's only Yogurt!\\" Everyone laughs including Aviv and Alron who both come to their senses. Since the television appearance has not yet been cancelled, Aviv commands everyone including Micki to get to rehearsal. Everyone cheers and is happy again. At the end of the film, The Troupe is seen performing live on television singing a song of peace and inviting the audience to join them on stage.

The causal agent is the Gram negative bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis. The first case of bacterial wilt of turf was reported in a cultivar of creeping bentgrass known as Toronto or C-15, which is found throughout the midwestern United States. Until the causal agent was identified in 1984, the disease was referred to simply as C-15 decline. This disease is almost exclusively found on putting greens at golf courses where extensive mowing creates wounds in the grass which the pathogen uses in order to enter the host and cause disease.Dernoeden, Peter H. et al. (January 2003) Bacterial Wilt: An enigmatic annual bluegrass disease of putting greens. Golf Course Magazine.  Hosts and symptoms  Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) and annual bluegrasses (Poa annua) are the makeup of most putting greens, as well as the preferred hosts of this pathogen. Specifically, Toronto (C-15), Seaside, and Nemisilla are the cultivars of creeping bentgrass most commonly affected.Latin, Rick and Martin, Bruce. \\"Bacterial Decline on Creeping Bentgrass-North and South Perspectives\\". gcsaa.org The bacteria enter the plant host and interfere with water and nutrient flow, causing the plant to look drought stressed and to take on a blueish-purple color. Additionally, symptoms of bacterial wilt of turf grass include yellow leaf spots, tan or brown spots, water soaked lesions, elongated yellow leaves and shriveling of aforementioned blue or dark green leaves. Since putting greens are not a pure stand of turf, some grass blades may be resistant to the bacterium and thus remain unharmed while the surrounding turf dies, rendering the putting surface inconsistent and unsightly, especially at high-end golf courses.Bacterial Wilt — Xanthomonas translucens pv. poae. Michigan State University.  Disease cycle  The bacterium overwinters in diseased plants and thatch and is disseminated by water through rain splash, or mechanically by mowers, hoses, other gardening equipment, and golf shoes. The pathogen can also be present in the host at planting in infected sprigs, sod, or plugs. Unlike fungi, bacterial plant pathogens are unable to wound or mechanically probe plant hosts on their own. Instead, these pathogens enter through wounds inflicted on plants through verticutting, cultivation, sand, or through natural openings such as stomates and hydathodes.Fech, John C., and Roch E. Gaussoin. \\"The Control Center: Bacterial Wilt.\\" Golf Course Superintendent Association of America. N.p., July 2010. Web. Once they have successfully entered and colonized the plant host, bacterial plant pathogens commandeer the nutrient and water supplies of plant cells to aid their own reproduction. In a study conducted by Zhou et al. (2013), the time between inoculation and wilt of host plants was found to depend heavily on temperature, with higher temperatures resulting in more rapid host decline. The researchers report the time between inoculation and wilting of host plants to be between 9–42 days. Bacteria can also spread to the roots of nearby plants underground. Within the plant host itself, bacteria spread by multiplying through binary fission and taking over more and more of the host by simply increasing their numbers.Bacterial Wilt. University of Connecticut. December 3, 2013.  Environment  Prolonged periods of wetness and/or poorly drained soils, followed by warm, sunny days and cool nights constitute the optimal conditions for bacterial wilt. Thus, transitions between spring and summer, and summer and autumn are usually accompanied by increases in bacterial wilt of turf grass as these seasonal changes, especially in the early fall, bring sustained rainfalls and longer, cooler nights. Bacterial wilt of turf grass has been reported in several regions of Illinois, as well as other Midwestern states such as Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Antiserum produced from an isolate of this pathogen in Illinois was found to have reacted to another such isolate from Europe, suggesting that the pathogen was brought over to North America from Europe.RPD No. 414 – Bacterial Wilt and Decline of Turfgrasses. University of Illinois- Extension, Oct. 1987. In fact, a survey of wheat and rye fields in Western Scotland demonstrated Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis infection in 71% of the fields, with rye grass bearing the most infection. Meadow fescue from the same fields also demonstrated susceptibility to the pathogen under laboratory conditions, further pointing to Europe as the potential origin of this pathogen in the United States.  Management  General biocides such as copper, Junction, or ZeroTol offer a potential solution to bacterial wilt of turf grass, however such chemical control ages must be applied after every mowing which may be economically impractical and ultimately phytotoxic.Bacterial Wilt of Annual Bluegrass. UMass Extension, Aug. 2011. Web. December 3, 2013. If bacterial wilt is present of the golf course, the best option may be to designate a mower for use on infected greens only in order to prevent the spread of the pathogen to other greens. Other viable methods include simply limiting the number of wounds the plant incurs, thereby limiting entry sites for the pathogen. A simple example would be less frequent mowing. It has also been proven that the disease is most devastating in grass cut to a length of between 1/8 and 3/16 of an inch, but less so in grass over 1/4 of an inch in length or longer, which presents an additional argument for limiting mowing. Another example is limiting sand topdressing as this is also a very abrasive technique which can create small wounds which allow entry of bacteria into the plant. A major factor complicating the control of Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis is weather. While it is not possible to control the weather per se, a study found great decreases in pathogen efficacy at temperatures below 20 °C, suggesting that cooling measures may be effective in combating this pathogen. Ideally, resistant strains of the host plant should be used to control such a plant pathogen, however no resistant cultivars of turf grass have been identified to date. While no completely resistant cultivars exist, golf course owners can find solace in the fact that certain cultivars such as Penncross and Penneagle are more resistant to bacterial wilt and may thus reduce the need for frequent chemical applications and other cultural controls. Researchers are making gains towards the identification of resistant cultivars as evidenced by the finding that variation in genetic linkage groups 1, 4, and 6 accounted for over 43% of resistance among Italian rye grass. A 1987 study found evidence of a possible biocontrol strategy for bacterial wilt of turf grass. The researchers found that antiserum to Pseudomonas fluorescens or Erwinia herbicola from hosts which have survived infections by the corresponding pathogens is capable of reducing wilt symptoms in turf grass caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis. The researchers did note, however, that while it is important to ensure the presence of a higher number of competing bacterial cells in order to reduce symptoms, one should take care to avoid over-infecting the host with a new bacterial pathogen. Further gains towards host resistance were made in 2001 when researchers found that inoculation of meadow fescue during breeding with a single aggressive strain of the bacterial wilt pathogen greatly increased resistance in offspring, thereby demonstrating the potential of selective breeding to reduce bacterial wilt pathogenesis on turf and rye grasses.  Importance  The impact of bacterial wilt of turf grass was perhaps most poignant when the disease destroyed the Toronto greens at the Butler National Golf Course in Illinois, just days before the PGA Western Open was set to take place there in 1980. While bacterial wilt of turf has plagued golf courses for many years, ongoing climate change may exacerbate its prominence, as the causal agent, Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis, prefers the persistent rainfalls and cool nights which tend to accompany weather changes.Occurrence of Bacterial Wilt On Poa Annua and Other Turfgrasses.
