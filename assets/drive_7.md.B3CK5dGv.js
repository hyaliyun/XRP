She was named after Cor Caroli, the brightest star in constellation Canes Venatici. She was responsible for delivering goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction Cor Caroli was launched 19 March 1943 as SS Betsy Ross, MCE hull 476, by Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2, Richmond, California, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract; sponsored by Mrs. B.F. Hodglin; acquired by the Navy 31 March 1943; commissioned 16 April 1943, Lieutenant Commander James A. Lewis, USCGR, in command; and reported to the Pacific Fleet. Service history After coastwise cargo operations, Cor Caroli cleared San Diego, California, 14 June 1943, for Auckland, New Zealand, arriving 18 July. Until 23 January 1944, she operated between Auckland and Noumea, Espiritu Santo, Guadalcanal, Suva, Efate, and Tulagi, supporting the South Pacific Ocean operations. She sailed from Auckland 8 January 1944 for Noum√©a, where she loaded additional cargo, and Lunga Point, arriving 28 January. =Shooting down a Japanese plane= She proceeded to Bougainville, where she joined in the invasion from 8 to 17 February, splashing a Japanese plane when air resistance developed. She returned to Bougainville with additional cargo from 6 to 11 March, and next operated off Emirau from 9 to 16 April in landings there. Cor Caroli continued to operate in the Solomons until 12 June, when she sailed for Eniwetok. After standing by in reserve during the invasion of Eniwetok, she sailed on with her cargo to Guam, where she participated in the assault from 27 July to 15 August. =Supporting Philippine invasion operations= Cor Caroli returned to the Southwest Pacific early in September 1944, and carried cargo among the bases there until 13 January 1945, when she arrived at Auckland to load new cargo, which she carried to Eniwetok and Guam. Returning to New Zealand for brief repairs, she sailed on to Pearl Harbor, arriving 8 June to load cargo for the Philippines. She ferried among Philippine ports between 13 July and 4 August, when she sailed for Guadalcanal, Espiritu Santo, Pearl Harbor, and San Pedro, California. Post-war decommissioning After overhaul, she continued to Norfolk, Virginia, arriving 17 November. Here she was decommissioned 30 November 1945, and returned to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 2 December 1945. She entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River Group, Lee Hall, Virginia, the same day. On 26 May 1978, she was released to the State of South Carolina to be used as an artificial reef off the coast of Hilton Head.

None are compulsory by law, meaning that there is no formal penalty for not possessing one. Certified identification cards are issued by the tax agency. The Swedish police issues passports and national identity cards for Swedish citizens. A Swedish driver's license, issued by the transport agency, is also accepted as an identity document. Banks sometimes issue identity cards for established customers or their children. In Sweden, no law has been introduced about compulsory identity documents. However, there is no law forbidding an authority or company to demand to see one, otherwise refusing service. Identity documents are needed in Sweden in certain commonly occurring situations, e.g. purchases using debit- or credit cards when not using a PIN, or picking up a package at the postal service representatives, or for age checking when purchasing alcoholic beverages, or to get medical care and medicines. A valid Swedish identity document is also required for opening a bank account or other situations where the use of Swedish personal identity number is required, although this varies from organisation to organisation. Car drivers mandatorily need the driver's license, and the police is also allowed to randomly check driver's licenses for drivers, normally done in combination with sobriety checks. For certain situations, the law says that safe identification is needed, without saying how it should done. In these cases a Swedish identity document is usually expected by authorities like the police. A person found committing a crime like speeding or no bus ticket, having no identity document, will be taken to the police station and kept until the identity is certified (even if identity documents are not compulsory). When the police are searching for criminals expected to have a car, they organise speeding checks or sobriety checks, since they are allowed to randomly ask for id only in this situation. Searches for illegal immigrants are often done in cooperation with guards checking local traffic tickets. It is a bad idea for a wanted criminal or illegal immigrant to ride without a ticket or shoplift in Sweden, since their identity must be investigated if caught. The most commonly used identity documents in Sweden is the driver's license (for those that have passed a driver's test) and the national identity card issued by the Police. The identity card issued by the Tax Agency is more commonly used by foreign citizens living in Sweden and not by Swedish citizens, because the identity card issued by the Tax Agency cost the same as the identity card issued by the Police, but the Tax Agency identity card is of lesser use since it cannot be used for travel within the European Union. Also while the Tax Agency card has a 13 year age limit, the national identity card has none and is often obtained by young people e.g. to prove eligibility of child tickets for public transport. History Historically in Sweden, it was the banks and the Swedish postal service that first saw a need that people should have identity documents. They issued identity documents for anyone having a Swedish Personal Identity Number. To prove the identity for this, relative simple routines were used, like having bank account documents, driver‚Äôs licence or passport, being recognised by the bank staff or bringing a friend with an identity document. These routines were used for decades from the 1960s until the 21st century although the security routines were strengthened during the time. Swedish passports were banned as an identity document during several years because they were relatively easy to forge, and allowed again after they were made more secure in 1998. The driver's licences had enough security to be accepted by the banks and became the most commonly used identity document. Authorities saw the need of checking identity of people in certain situations, to make sure which personal identity number the person in front of them had. For example, handling payment for sick leave, driver's licence tests or police arrests. For this usually the identity documents accepted by the banks were allowed, because there was no law regarding identity documents and how they were issued. Around year 2005 banks strengthened their routine to issue identity cards, so only near relatives verifiable by the banks, in reality only parents or adult children, could guarantee the identity of some who had no valid identity document. This other person needed a valid Swedish identity document. The reason was the existence of identity fraud, and that banks had to pay compensation to people affected. The cashier service owned by the postal service followed this rule in 2007. There was no law about these rules or saying that banks or the cashier service had to issue these cards. As a consequence, everyone who did not have any Swedish parent or adult child could not get an identity document. Swedish citizens could get a passport, but not citizens of other countries resident in Sweden. In e.g. Norway and Denmark, immigrants could get a bank id card based on the residence permit and foreign passport, but not in Sweden, since no rule regulated it and the Swedish Migration Board did also not want to guarantee the identity. The government decided that they should take the responsibility to issue identity documents to people in Sweden, and issues a law. As a consequence of this, the Swedish Tax Agency started issuing certified identity cards in August 2009. During two and a half years, foreign citizens without a parent resident in Sweden could not get an identity document, if they had none. Still in 2010 several thousands of people are unable to get identity documents. Since the entry into the Schengen area 2001 the Swedish police randomly asks for identity documents in crowded places, stating suspicion of illegal stay by foreign citizens as reason (In-country foreigner checks, Swedish:\\"Inre utl√§nningskontroll\\"). According to allegations, skin color was used as indication of illegal stay (an indication of crime is needed to justify identity document checks). Domestic identity documents =National identity card= The national identity card is issued by the Swedish police and applications are filed at police stations which have a passport office. The national identity card can only be obtained by Swedish citizens. It is a valid identity document within the European union, since 1 July 2015 also including member states which are not part of the Schengen Area. The card is valid for five years. The card is equipped with a contact chip prepared for being able to function as an electronic identity card (eID) at a later date, and also a contactless RFID chip containing the card's printed data in a digital format along with the photograph in a JPEG format along with a digital key to verify that the data contained is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. The data in the contactless card can only be accessed after using the printed codes on the back side of the card. To get one another valid identity document is needed, or a person from a similar list as the tax agency card vouching the identity, but there is no \\"balanced assessment\\" or \\"residence permit\\" routine. =Identity cards from the Tax Agency= Certified identification cards can be obtained by anyone who is population registered in Sweden, that is over 13 years of age, and has a Swedish personal identity number. The Swedish Tax Agency issues identity cards for anyone fulfilling the requirement of being population registered in Sweden, and can provide an accepted means of identifying oneself. This last rule caused many problems for foreigners and even some Swedes between 2007 and 2010. As of 1 October 2010 in order to get a Swedish ID card, the following are required: * Age 13 or over (people aged 13‚Äì17 must have legal guardian present at application) (Swedish citizens can get a passport or national id card as newborns) * A Swedish Personal Identity Number. * 400 SEK paid to the Swedish Tax Agency via a Swedish bank, prior to your application. * To verify your identity with EITHER an approved ID document, limited to: :# A Swedish issued ID card (either from a government agency, such as a Swedish national ID or Driver's licence, or another that conforms to the SIS security standard, such as ID cards issued by banks), :# A Swedish passport issued on or after 1 September 2006 (Red cover with embedded biometrics), :# A valid passport from EU or from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland :* OR, a Residence Permit :* OR, someone to vouch for your identity in person at the time of application, having one of the above approved ID document, being at least 18 years old and limited to: :# Parents/Guardians, Foster Parents, Grandparents, Siblings, Half-Siblings, Children, and Grandchildren, :# Employers of at least 1 year, :# \\"Trustees or administrators\\", :# Public officials from a local or state authority with whom you have a professional relationship, such as a social welfare secretary, a refugee administrator (or similar), an institution superintendent, or an international adviser at a state university. There has been trouble that such officials have denied doing that claiming they could not 100% guarantee the identity or did not have the time needed to visit the tax office with every applicant. * If one fails to meet these requirements, one can also request a \\"balanced assessment\\". In this case, the Tax Agency will compare the information on your application with what is on file with other agencies and make a decision. An expired passport, a passport from non-EU/EEA countries and/or a former employer might be sufficient combined with other information. * One's photo taken and your height measured at the Tax Agency office when you apply. Processing time to receive a card is two business weeks from time of approval. Approval times ranges from instant to eight weeks, depending on your situation. Foreigners using a residency permit to verify their identity face longer wait times due to the fact that the immigration board does not collect digital captures of signatures, and in order to instantly approve an application, the employee taking the application must be able to match the signed signature to something on file. Foreign passports will be checked with the home country which might take time. Still the identity cards are not 100.0% reliable, since there might still be people prepared to do false certification. For example, it has happened that parents with adult children have vouched for other people to be their child, who got id cards in the children's name, being able to get bank loans and credit cards etc. Cards might be stolen and people have a responsibility to report stolen id cards as soon as possible. Forged or stolen id cards is also a growing problem. =Other ID Cards= Most of the Swedish banks can issue identity cards for their customers, but have generally stopped doing so. They still often issue ID cards to children (age 13 or above) of established customers, as a way of getting new customers. Some businesses and government authorities issue SIS certified identification cards to their employees, accepted as identity documents. Examples include police officers and journalists. Others issue more simple cards only usable inside the company. =Driver's license= Driver's licenses are issued by the Swedish Transport Agency to residents in Sweden, and are generally accepted as identity documents in the same manner as the identification cards issued by the banks and postal service. To obtain one, either an EU driver's license can be exchanged to a Swedish one, or a full skill test must be done. The test requires possession of a valid Swedish identity document (such as one issued by the Tax agency) or an EU/EFTA passport (EU/EFTA ID cards not accepted). People without a valid document should get an identity card first. Driver's license have a little less security than identity cards as they have less technical security features. Also due to the fact that the Transport Agency does not take photos, instead the user obtains a photo and sends it to the agency. Still they are considered having at least as high trustworthiness as id cards because people with good economy usually have driver's licenses, and id cards are mostly used by people without a license. Driver's licenses are valid for five years if they allow heavy vehicle driving, and ten years otherwise. =Passport= The burgundy- colour Swedish passports issued since 1998 are accepted as identity documents. The blue passports issued up until 1998 are not accepted as identity documents due to insufficient security features. Passports issued since October 1, 2005 are of a biometric variety and valid for five years. Passports are issued by the Swedish police and applications are filed at police stations which have a passport office. The passports issued since October 1, 2005 contain an RFID chip containing the passport's printed data in a digital format along with the photograph in a JPEG format along with a digital key to verify that the data contained is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. The data in the chip can only be accessed after using the printed codes on the lower part of the passport's person page. Fingerprints are stored since June 28, 2009. Foreign identity documents Swedish citizens need a passport when travelling from Sweden directly to a non-EU/EFTA country (though not the reverse, in which case any document stating nationality, including a national ID card is sufficient) Passlag (1978:302) Other EU/EFTA citizens do not need a passport (if they have a national ID card) to leave EU/EFTA from Sweden. When staying in Sweden (as opposed to crossing the border) having a passport is needed for foreign citizens, except for EU/EEA citizens. However, in order to get a Swedish driving licence or an ID card from the Tax Authority, EU/EFTA ID cards are not accepted, so unless already having a Swedish ID document, a passport is required.Utl√§nningslag (2005:716) When trying to obtain services requiring an identity document, foreign passports and other identification documents (including EU/EFTA ID cards) are often not accepted in Sweden. This especially happens in situations requiring the Swedish personal identity number (like in banks) as such documents do not contain said number. The security level of foreign-issued documents may also be considered insufficient. While banks have systems to verify if a particular identity document has been stolen, this only works for Swedish ones. The Schengen Information System has such info for EU/EEA passports, but only authorities can use it and not banks or post offices. Since 2009, EU/EEA passports (but not ID cards) have been accepted as identification documents in Sweden owing to EU legislation. Banks still (2011), for theft check and Swedish personal identity number verification reasons, often still reject foreign EU passports, and recommend getting a Swedish id card issued by the tax authority, which can be obtained on the basis of an EU/EFTA passport (but not ID card). The Nordic Passport Union extend the rule that identity documents are not needed by domestic citizens, to cover all Nordic citizens. Still identity documents might be needed for services like air or train travel, hotel stays, credit card purchase, age verification and more. For this a passport, a driver's licence (needed for car driving), or a national identity card (which Norway and Denmark don't have) can be used. Other identity cards might not be accepted since they are less known in Sweden, not the least so for Norwegian bank identity cards which are printed on the reverse of credit cards, a card type that Sweden does not have. Since January 2016 border controls have been re-instated for travelers coming from Denmark across the Oresund strait meaning that also Nordic citizens need to show an official document showing citizenship; for Danes and Norwegians this means that a passport for their part is required, although a Nordic driver's license (but no other id card) is accepted. The controls are said to be temporary but are still in place .

Source: Pierre Allix, Alan K. Burnham. The history of the oil shale industry started in ancient times. The modern industrial use of oil shale for oil extraction dates to the mid-19th century and started growing just before World War I because of the mass production of automobiles and trucks and the supposed shortage of gasoline for transportation needs. Between the World Wars oil shale projects were begun in several countries.Dyni (2010), pp. 103‚Äì122 After World War II, the oil shale industry declined due to increased accessibility to conventional crude oil. As of 2010, oil shale was commercially used in Estonia, China and Brazil, while several countries are considering to start or restart commercial use of oil shale. Early history Humans have used oil shale as a fuel since prehistoric times, since it generally burns without any processing. It was also used for decorative purposes and construction. Britons of the Iron Age used to polish and form oil shale into ornaments. Around 3000 BC, \\"rock oil\\" was used in Mesopotamia for road construction and making architectural adhesives. As a decorative material, oil shale was also used over the Greek, Roman, Byzantinian, Umayyad and Abbasid periods to decorate mosaics and floors of the palaces, churches and mosques. Shale oil was used for medical and military purposes. Mesopotamians used it for medical purposes and for caulking ships, Mongols used to cap their arrows with flaming oil shale. In the 10th century, the Arabian physician Masawaih al-Mardini (Mesue the Younger) described a method of extraction of oil from \\"some kind of bituminous shale\\".Forbes (1970), pp. 41‚Äì42 In the early 14th century, the first use of shale oil was recorded in Switzerland and Austria. In 1350, a knight Berthold von Ebenhausen was awarded a right to exploit the Seefeld oil shale in Tyrol. Oil shale was used for production of shale oil using an early retorting method of heating the crushed oil shale put in crucibles.Forbes (1970), p. 251 The healing properties of a mineral oil distilled from oil shale were noted in 1596 by the personal physician of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg Frederick I. In Sk√•ne, the Swedish alum shale dating from the Cambrian and Ordovician periods was used for extracting potassium aluminium sulfate by roasting it over fire as early as 1637.Dyni (2010), p. 118 In Italy, shale oil was used to light the streets of Modena at the turn of the 17th century. The British Crown granted a patent in 1694 to three persons named Martin Eele, Thomas Hancock and William Portlock who had \\"found a way to extract and make great quantities of pitch, tarr, and oyle out of a sort of stone.\\" Cane (1976), p. 56 Shale oil was produced by extracting Shropshire oil shale.Francu et al. (2007), p. 1 Later sold as Betton's British Oil, the distilled product was said to have been \\"tried by divers persons in Aches and Pains with much benefit.\\"Forbes (1970), p. 250 In 1781, Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald, registered a patent for an extraction process to produce tar, pitch and oil from coal and bituminous shales, using masonry retorts and wooden condensers.Addison et al. (1985), p. 35 In Russia Peter the Great initiated an investigative program of Ukhta oil shale in 1697. Data on physical and chemical properties of Ukhta oil shale was published by a correspondent member of the Russian Academy Tertii Bornovolokov in 1809. In 1769, Peter Simon Pallas described oil shale of the Volga Region. In the 1830s Germain Henri Hess investigated Baltic oil shales with resulting determination of the semicoking process product yields. Oil shale in Australia was referred to for the first time by Fran√ßois P√©ron, et al., in Voyage de D√©couverte aux Terres Australes which was published in Paris in 1807, describing what was probably torbanite from the Newnes deposit. Start of the modern industry alt=In this vertical Alexander C. Kirk's retort, used in the mid-to-late 19th century, was one of the first vertical oil shale retorts. Its design is typical of retorts used in the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.Addison et al. (1985), pp. 44‚Äì45 James \\"Paraffin\\" Young. The remains of a shale bing, Drumshoreland, near Pumpherston. The modern industrial use of oil shale for oil extraction started in France, where oil shale commercial mining began in Autun in 1837. The shale oil production started in 1838 by using Selligue process, invented by Alexander Selligue. In 1846 the Canadian physician and geologist Abraham Gesner invented a process for retorting an illuminating liquid from coal, bitumen and oil shale.Nersesian (2010), p. 124Forbes et al. (1957), p. 3 In 1847 the Scottish chemist James Young prepared \\"lighting oil,\\" lubricating oil and wax from cannel coal and since 1862 from torbanite.Prien (1976), p. 235 In 1850 he patented the process of retorting and refining shale oil and purifying paraffin wax from it.Trass (2011), p. 9 Commercial scale shale oil extraction from lamosite started in 1859 by Robert Bell in Broxburn, West Lothian. After the expiry of Young's patent in 1862 many small shale oil works were opened. By 1865, there were about 120 shale oil works in Scotland. In 1866 Young established Young's Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Company at Addiewell. Other notable shale oil companies were the Broxburn Oil Company established in 1878 and the Pumpherston Oil Company established in 1892. In the United States early oil- shale industry concentrated on the eastern oil shale deposits. An oil distillery was built in 1855 at Breckinridge County, Kentucky to produce oil from locally mined cannel coal. By the following year it was producing . In 1860, there were 55 companies in the United States extracting oil from locally mined cannel coal.Ashley (1918), pp. 42‚Äì43 Commercial-scale shale oil extraction, other than cannel coal processing, began at shale oil retorts using the Devonian oil shale along the Ohio River Valley in 1857. However, the discovery of cheap and abundant petroleum in the same region, starting with the Drake Oil Well at Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859, put the American oil shale industry out of business by 1860.OTA (1980), p. 110 The largest deposit, Green River Formation, was accidentally discovered in 1874 but not utilized until beginning of the 20th century. In 1857, oil shale industry started in Germany.OTA (1980), p. 109 In Canada, the Craigleith Shale Oil Works started to retort oil shale of the Ordovician Whitby Formation near Collingwood, Ontario, on Lake Huron in 1859. In 1861 it became economically infeasible due to the discovery of petroleum nearby. In Australia, the first oil shale mine was commenced in 1865 at American Creek, Mount Kembla in New South Wales. At the same year, the first shale oil was produced by the Pioneer Kerosene Works at American Creek.Kraemer et al. (1951), p. 4 A number of other mines and shale oil plants were opened in New South Wales; however, in the beginning of the 20th century they were closed due to the import of cheaper crude oil.Kraemer et al. (1951), pp. 6‚Äì7 In Austria, oil shale was used in 1840‚Äì1882 for production of asphalt mastic, naphtha and asphalt tar. In Sweden, the first attempt to extract oil from alum shale was made in 1864. Shale oil production started in the 1890s and lasted few years.Dyni (2010), p. 96 In Brazil, oil shale was first exploited in 1884 in Bahia.Dyni (2010), pp. 105‚Äì106 In 1900 shale oil extraction industry was initiated also in New Zealand. In 1894, the Pumpherston retort (also known as the Bryson retort) was invented, which is considered as a separation of the oil shale industry from the coal industry.Addison et al. (1985), p. 38 It stayed in use until 1938. Operations during the 19th century focused on the production of kerosene, lamp oil, and paraffin wax; these products helped supply the growing demand for lighting that arose during the Industrial Revolution. Fuel oil, lubricating oil and grease, and ammonium sulfate were also produced. Beginning of the 20th century Oil retort at Kilve, West Somerset, England Pumpherston oil shale retorts, Scotland, 1922 The oil shale industry expanded immediately before World War I because of limited access to conventional petroleum resources and the mass production of automobiles and trucks, which accompanied an increase in gasoline consumption. Oil shale production in Scotland peaked in 1910‚Äì1912 with more than three million tonnes. That time Scottish shale oil industry contributed 2% of global oil production. After that, production declined with exception of the period of World War II. In 1919, five survived shale oil companies (Young's Paraffin Light & Mineral Oil Company, Broxburn Oil Company, Pumpherston Shale Oil Company, Oakbank Oil Company, and James Ross & Company Philpstoun Oil Works), were merged into Scottish Oils, a subsidiary of Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Bamberg et al. (1994), p. 177Marwick (1964), p. 175 Oil shale retorts, Nevada, 1922 In the United States the government started to create the Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves in 1909. The reserves were seen as a possible emergency source of fuel for the military, particularly the Navy. The government reserved the Roan Plateau near Rifle, Colorado which later became a federal demonstration and test site. First attempt to produce oil from the western deposits was made in Nevada by local businessman Robert Catlin by acquiring oil-shale properties in the 1890s and erecting the first retorts in 1915 and 1916. Although the attempt was commercially unsuccessful, in 1917 he incorporated Catlin Shale Products Company which made several unsuccessful attempts to sold shale oil products until it was dissolved in 1930.EPA (1979), pp. C-1‚ÄìC-2 The first attempts to exploit the Green River Formation deposit was made by establishment of The Oil Shale Mining Company in 1916. In 1917, they erected the first commercial retort at the head of Dry Creek, near De Beque, Colorado. However, also these attempts were unsuccessful and by 1926 the company had lost its property. In addition, companies like Cities Service, Standard Oil of California, Texaco and Union started their oil shale operations in 1918‚Äì1920. In 1915‚Äì1920 about 200 companies were established to exploit oil shale and at least 25 shale oil retorting processes reached to the pilot-plant stage. Discoveries of the large quantities of petroleum in eastern Texas ended the oil-shale boom. One of technological achievements before World War II was invention of the N-T-U retort. In 1925, the NTU Company built a test plant at Sherman Cut near Casmalia, California. In 1925‚Äì1929, the retort was also tested by the United States Bureau of Mines in their Oil Shale Experiment Station at Anvil Point in Rifle, Colorado.Carter et al. (1939), p. 373 During World War I, the German Army produced shale oil from the Jordan oil shale at the Yarmouk area to operate the Hejaz Railway. In 1915 an oil shale industry was established in Switzerland.Mushrush (1995), p. 39 About 1920, a small mall shale oil extraction plant was opened at Kinnekulle, Sweden. In 1922, a small shale oil extraction plant was opened in Puertollano, Spain.EPA (1979), p. C-9 The year 1916 is considered the beginning of the Estonian oil shale industry.Aaloe et al. (2007), p. 3 when a group of geologists, led by Nikolay Pogrebov, was sent to Estonia to organise the mining of oil shale and its transportation to Saint Petersburg (then known as Petrograd). In June 1916, the first tonnes of oil shale were mined at Pavandu and delivered to Saint Petersburg Polytechnical University for large-scale experiments. In 1917, Russian paleontologist Mikhail Zalessky named kukersite oil shale after the Kukruse settlement. Continuous mining activities started shortly after.Aaloe et al. (2007), p. 21 Initially, oil shale was used primarily in the cement industry, for firing in locomotive furnaces, and as a household fuel, followed by shale oil and power production. As of 1925, all locomotives in Estonia were powered by oil shale.Holmberg (2008), p. 94 The first experimental oil shale processing retorts were built in 1921, using the method developed by Julius Pintsch AG. In 1924, the Tallinn Power Plant was the first power plant in the world to employ oil shale as its primary fuel.Ots (2004), pp. 15‚Äì16 In 1939 Estonia mined 1.453 million tonnes of oil shale and produced 181,000 tonnes of shale oil, including 22,500 tonnes of oil that were suitable gasoline equivalents. Almost half of Estonian produced shale oil was exported accounting for 8% of country's total export. In China, the extraction of oil shale began in 1926 under the Japanese rule.Dyni (2006), p. 15 The commercial-scale production of shale oil began in 1930 in Fushun, Manchuria, with the construction of the \\"Refinery No. 1\\" operating Fushun-type retorts.Dyni (2006), p. 13 In Russia, Kashpirskoye oil shale near Syzran in the Volga region was mined and processed in 1919‚Äì1924 and again starting from 1929. Leningradslanets opened the Kirov oil shale mine in 1934 in Slantsy, Leningrad Oblast and shale oil production started in 1939. Saratov and Syzran power stations in Russia started to use oil shale as fuel. In South Africa different attempts of using oil shale were made since beginning of century. In 1903 the Transvaal Oil Shale Syndicate investigated oil shale at Kikvorschfontein. In 1919‚Äì1931 the African Oil Corporation investigated oil shale at Kromhoek and Goedgevonden. In 1935, The South African Torbanite Mining and Refining Company, a joint venture of Anglo- Transvaal Consolidated Investment Company and Burmah Oil opened shale oil plant at Ermelo in 1935.Kraemer et al. (1954), p. 4 Between the World Wars oil shale projects were also in restarted in Brazil and, for a short time, in Canada. World War II In 1939‚Äì1945, a shale oil pilot plant operated in Morocco.Dyni (2010), p. 116 In Australia shale oil production restarted shortly before World War II. In 1937, the National Oil Proprietary was created. The Glen Davis Shale Oil Works became operational at Glen Davis, New South Wales in 1940 as the main facility in the country.EPA (1979), p. C-4Kraemer et al. (1951), p. 11 In addition, in 1940‚Äì1952, three N-T-U retorts were operated at Marangaroo, New South Wales.OTA (1980), p. 139 Mapstone (1950), p. 489 In Sweden, Svenska skifferolje AB (Swedish Shale Oil Company) was formed in 1940.Prien (1976), p. 236 It exploited one of the earliest in- situ processes‚Äìunderground gasification by electrical energy (Ljungstr√∂m method)‚Äìbetween 1940 and 1966 at Kvarntorp.OTA (1980), pp. 108‚Äì109 During the German occupation of Estonia, Estonia's oil shale industry was merged into a company named Baltische √ñl GmbH. This entity was subordinated to Kontinentale √ñl, a company that had exclusive rights to oil production in German-occupied territories.Holmberg (2008), pp. 130‚Äì131 The primary purpose of the industry was production of oil for the German Army. In Germany shale oil extraction started at the Dotternhausen cement factory in 1940.EPA (1979), p. C-6 Later the Operation Desert (Unternehmen W√ºste) was launched for the oil extraction from Swabian Alb oil shale deposits (Posidonia Shale). However, out of ten planned shale-oil extraction plants only four became operational. The used modified in-situ process was primitive with extremely low oil recovery and it was hard to control.OTA (1980), p. 133 In 1944 the United States adopted the Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program with goal to establish a liquid fuel supply from domestic oil shale. The Bureau of Mines started mining studies and development of the gas combustion retort process at Anvil Point. In 1943 Mobil Oil built a pilot shale oil extraction plant and in 1944 Union built an experimental oil shale retort. In 1945 Texaco started shale oil refining study. 1950s‚Äì1960s Anvils Point Research Center in 1970. Although the Estonian, Russian and Chinese oil shale industries continued to grow after World War II, most other countries abandoned their projects due to high processing costs and the availability of cheaper petroleum. The shale oil extraction in Australia was discontinued in 1952 due to ceasing of government funding, in France in 1957, in Britain and South Africa in 1962, and in Sweden and Spain in 1966.Dyni (2010), pp. 103; 110; 118 In Germany only Rohrbach Zement (now part of Holcim) in Dotternhausen continued using oil shale for cement, power and thermal energy production.Dyni (2010), p. 110 After World War II, the Soviet occupation regime restored the oil shale industry in Estonia. In 1945, the first tunnel kiln was restored and by the end of the 1940s four tunnel kilns had been restored. German prisoners of war contributed most of the labour.Holmberg (2008), pp. 134; 293 In addition to tunnel kilns a number of Kiviter-type retorts and the first Galoter-type retort were built in the 1950s. Since 1948, Estonian-produced oil shale gas was used in Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) and in northern Estonia cities as a substitute for natural gas. Alekperov (2011), p. 146 During the 1950s, unsuccessful tests of oil shale underground gasification were conducted at Kivi√µli. Francu et al. (2007), p. 8 In 1946‚Äì1952, uranium compounds were extracted from Graptolitic argillite oil shale in Sillam√§e.Dyni (2006), p. 17 In 1949, the Kohtla-J√§rve Power Plant ‚Äì the first power plant in the world using pulverized oil shale at an industrial scale ‚Äì was commissioned in Estonia. The world's two largest oil shale-fired power stations ‚Äì Balti Power Plant and Eesti Power Plant (known as the Narva Power Plants) ‚Äì were opened in 1965 and in 1973.Dyni (2010), p. 108 In 1965, of oil shale gas were produced and 16.5 million tonnes of oil shale were mined in Estonia.Holmberg (2008), p. 140 In Russia, the Slantsy oil shale gas extraction plant was built for supplying oil shale gas to Leningrad and the first unit of the Slantsy oil-shale-fired power plant were commissioned in 1952. Since 1955 until 2003, the plant also produced shale oil using Kiviter technology. In China, the \\"Refinery No. 2\\" of Fushun began its production in 1954 and in 1959, the maximum annual shale oil production increased to 780,000 tonnes. The produced shale oil was used for producing light liquid fuels. In 1961, China was producing one third of its total oil production from oil shale. Afterwards the shale oil production decreased due to the discovery of Daqing oil field and increased production of the cheaper conventional petroleum. In 1951, the United States Department of Defense became interested in oil shale as an alternative resource for producing a jet fuel.Andrews (2006), p. 9 The United States Bureau of Mines continued its research program at Anvil Point until 1956. It opened a demonstration mine which operated at a small scale. From 1949 to 1955 it also tested the gas combustion retort.OTA (1980), p. 140 In 1964 the Avril Point demonstration facility was leased by Colorado School of Mines and was used by Mobil-led consortium (Mobil, Humble, Continental, Amoco, Phillips and Sinclair) for further development of that type of retort. In 1953, Sinclair Oil Corporation developed an in-situ processing method using existing and induced fractures between vertical wells.Lee (1990), p. 124 In the 1960s, a proposal known as Project Bronco, was suggested for a modified in situ process which involved creation of a rubble chimney (a zone in the rock formation created by breaking the rock into fragments) using a nuclear explosive. This plan was abandoned by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1968. Companies developing experimental in-situ retorting processes also included Equity Oil, ARCO, Shell Oil and the Laramie Energy Technology Center. Unocal Corporation started the development of the Union process in the late 1940s, when the Union A retort was designed.Merrow (1978), p. 107 This technology was tested between 1954 and 1958 at the company-owned tract in the Parachute Creek.BLM (2008), p. A-15 This production was finally shut down in 1961 due to cost. In 1957 Texaco built a shale oil extraction pilot plant to develop its own hydroretorting process. In the early 1960s TOSCO (The Oil Shale Corporation) opened an underground mine and built an experimental plant near Parachute, Colorado. It was closed in 1972 because the price of production exceeded the cost of imported crude oil. 1970s‚Äì1980s The Colony oil shale development site in August 1973. Due to the 1973 oil crisis, the oil shale industry restarted in several countries. The United States Navy and the Office of Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves started evaluations of oil shale's suitability for military fuels, such as jet fuels, marine fuels and a heavy fuel oil. Shale-oil based JP-4 jet fuel was produced until the early 1990s, when it was replaced with kerosene-based JP-8. Seventeen companies led by Standard Oil of Ohio formed the Paraho Development Corporation to develop the Paraho process. Production started in 1974 but was closed in 1978. In 1974 the United States Department of the Interior announced an oil shale leasing program in the oil shale regions of Colorado and Utah. In 1980 the Synthetic Fuels Corporation was established which operated until 1985. In 1972, the first modified in situ oil shale experiment in the United States was conducted by Occidental Petroleum at Logan Wash, Colorado.Bunger et al. (2004), pp. A2‚ÄìA3 Rio Blanco Oil Shale Company, a partnership between Gulf Oil and Standard Oil of Indiana, originally considered using Lurgi‚ÄìRuhrgas above-ground retort but in 1977 switch also to the modified in-situ process.OTA (1980), p. 124 In 1985 the company ceased its operations. The White River Shale Corporation, a partnership of Sun Oil, Phillips and Sohio, existed between 1974 and 1986 for developing the tract in the Uintah Basin on the White River area. EPA (1979), pp. C-3 In 1977, Superior Oil Company cancelled its Meeker shale oil plant project. Year later Ashland, Cleveland Cliffs and Sohio exited the Colony Shale Oil Project near Parachute, Colorado. Also, Shell exited the Colony project but continued with in-situ test. The United States oil shale industry collapsed when oil prices fell in the early 1980s. On 2 May 1982, known as \\"Black Sunday\\", Exxon cancelled the Colony project due to low oil-prices and increased expenses, laying off more than 2,000 workers. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 which among other things abolished the United States' Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program.Andrews (2006), p. 11 The last oil shale retort in the United States, operated by Unocal Corporation, was closed in 1991. Because of the success of oil shale- based power generation, Estonian oil shale mining peaked in 1980 at 31.35 million tonnes and oil-shale-based power generation peaked at the same year at 18.9 TWh. Francu et al. (2007), p. 45 The largest oil shale mine in the world ‚Äì the Estonia Mine ‚Äì was opened in 1972. In 1980 the Narva Oil Plant was commissioned. The industry declined during the two decades that followed this peak. Demand for locally produced electrical power was reduced by construction of nuclear power stations in the Soviet Union, particularly Leningrad Nuclear Power Station. In Israel, a 0.1 MW pilot oil shale-fired power plant was tested in 1982‚Äì1986. A 12.5 MW fluidised-bed demonstration plant in Mishor Rotem became operational in 1989.Dyni (2010), p. 112 In Romania, a 990 MW oil shale-fired power plant at Crivina operated in 1983‚Äì1988; however, it was decommissioned due to inefficiency and technical problems. In Brazil a 2,400 tons per day semi-works retort (the Irati Profile Plant) was brought on line in 1972, and began limited commercial operation in 1980. A pilot plant that used Petrosix technology started in 1982. It was followed by a demonstration plant in 1984. A commercial retort was brought into service in December 1991.Bunger et al. (2004), p. 13 Latest developments The global oil shale industry started to grow slightly in the mid-1990s although most of the industries were ceased in Russia.Dyni (2010), p. 117 Oil-shale-fired power stations in Slantsy and Syzran were converted to use natural gas and fuel oil. Also, shale-oil producer Zavod Slantsy ceased oil-shale processing. Only Syzran processing plant continued using oil shale for production of ammonium bituminosulfonate. Existing shale oil extraction plants in Fushun and Moaming, China, were closed in the beginning of 1990s. However, the new shale oil plants in Fushun consist of 220 retorts and the annual capacity has increased up to 350,000 tonnes of shale oil. Several other projects have been developed in various locations. In 2005, China became the largest shale oil producer in the world with an increased number of companies involved in the shale oil extraction. After decrease in the beginning of 1990s Estonian oil shale production has continuously increased since 1995. Several new processing plants using modified Galoter technology have been built. In 2006, 90 years after major mining had begun, one billion tonnes were mined. Construction of the new 300 MW oil shale-fired power plant began in 2012. In Australia, the Alberta Taciuk technology was used for a demonstration-scale processing plant at the Stuart Deposit near Gladstone, Queensland, which produced between 2000 and 2004 over of shale oil. In 2008‚Äì2009, the facility was dismantled and a new demonstration plant based on the Paraho II process was opened in September 2011. In the United States, an oil shale development program was initiated in 2003. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced a commercial leasing program for oil shale and tar sands resources on public lands within the states of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. In 2007, leases were awarded to Chevron Shale Oil, EGL Resources (now American Shale Oil), Oil Shale Exploration Company (now Enefit American Oil) and Shell Frontier Oil & Gas, and in 2010 to ExxonMobil, Natural Soda and AuraSource. Several other companies like Red Leaf Resources and TomCo Energy operates on the private leases. However, Chevron closed its Chevron CRUSH project in 2012 and Shell closed its Mahogany Research Project in 2013. Since 2006 the government of Jordan has signed a number of memorandum of understanding with foreign companies for shale oil production, including with Petrobras, and has signed concession agreements with Shell, Eesti Energia, Karak International Oil and Saudi Arabian International Corporation for Oil Shale Investment. In 2008, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of Jordan, the National Electricity Power Company of Jordan, and Eesti Energia signed an agreement to build the 460 MW oil shale-fired Attarat Power Plant. In 2005 Morocco adopted a new strategy and legal framework for oil shale activities. Since then different agreements have been signed with a number of companies, including Petrobras, Total S.A. and San Leon Energy. In April 2010, the 4th Workshop on Regional Cooperation for Clean Utilization of Oil Shale was held in Egypt and later the same month an Oil Shale Cooperation Center was established in Amman by Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Syria and Turkey. In 2011, Israel closed the Mishor Rotem Power Station. In 2013, Uzbekistani national oil company Uzbekneftegaz started construction of the shale oil extraction plant on the Sangruntau oil shale deposit.

They were originally from Baler but they moved to Leyte in 1860 when Soledad's father, an officer in the artillery corps, was transferred. Early life In 1874 his mother moved back to Manila. Manuel attended Colegio de la Immaculada Concepcion. He transferred to the Ateneo Municipal as an alumno interno de beca. He took up undergraduate studies in medicine at University of Santo Tomas. After three years he transferred to Colegio de San Juan de Letran. In 1883 he became a civil servant. To supplement his income, Artigas wrote prolifically, basing many of his works on important archival materials: ‚Ä¢ El Municipio Filipino (a collection of laws of Manila) ‚Ä¢ Historia Municipal de Filipinas desde los Primeros Tiempos de la Dominacion Espa√±ola hasta nuestros Dias (1894, 2 vols) ‚Ä¢ Los Sucesos de 1872 (Manila, 1911) ‚Ä¢ Rese√±a de la Provincia de Leyte (Manila, 1914) ‚Ä¢ El Procedimento Administrativo y la Jurisdiccion Centencioso-Administivo y la Jurisdiction en Filipinas ‚Ä¢ Diccionario Tecnico-histerico de la Administracion de Filipinas-Manila ‚Ä¢ Historia de las Revoluciones Filipinas ‚Ä¢ Historia de Filipinas (Manila, 1916) ‚Ä¢ El Parlamento Filipino-Manila ‚Ä¢ La Primera Imprenta del Filipinas-Manila ‚Ä¢ El General Antonio Luna Novicio ‚Ä¢ Rese√±a Historica dela Universidad de Santo Tomas de Manila ‚Ä¢ Historia de la Instruccion Publica en Filipinas ‚Ä¢ Bibliografia Medico-Famtaceutica. Career He was recognized because of his incessant writings and in 1907, he became assistant librarian in the Philippine Section of the American Circulating Library. He initiated Act No. 1849 which created the Philippine Public Library. In 1919 he was promoted to curator of the Filipiniana division. Then in 1911 he was appointed chief of the division. Four years later he was promoted to chief of the Philippine Library, and in 1921, appointed acting director. He rapidly expanded the Filipiniana collection from 829 titles in December 1907 to more than 20,000 titles in December 1914. Artigas did this by acquiring the private collections of James LeRoy, Jose P. Rizal, Jose Clemente Zulueta, T.H. Pardo de Tavera, Mariano Ponce and the Tabacalera. Due to his efforts, the Filipiniana collection of the Philippine National Library became one of the most complete collection in Philippine studies. He was a member of the executive board of the Asociacion Historico-Geografica de Filipinas as well as the prestigious Academia de la Lengua Filipina. In 1915, he was inducted as an honorary corresponding member of the Real Sociedad Geografica de Madrid, and in 1916 entered the roster of members of the Real Academia de la Historia, and the Academia Hispano-Americana de Cadiz, Spain. Aside from being a curator, librarian, and historian, Artigas also excelled in the development of Philippine historical studies through his many publications. Artigas wrote the biographies of Antonio Luna, Apolinario Mabini, Wenceslao Retana, Andres Bonifacio, Graciano Lopez Jaena, Juan Cailles and Mariano Ponce. Apart from these biographies, he also published the multi-volume Galeria de Filipinos Ilustres, a book about important and illustrious Filipinos during that time. Artigas died on April 2, 1925.

Source for most of the information in this article. Kaluga Oblast, about southwest of Moscow, Soviet Union. Connected to the power grid in June 1954, Obninsk was the first grid-connected nuclear power plant in the world, i.e. the first nuclear reactor that produced electricity industrially, albeit at small scale. It was located at the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering. The plant is also known as APS-1 Obninsk (Atomic Power Station 1 Obninsk). It remained in operation between 1954 and 2002, although its production of electricity for the grid ceased in 1959; thereafter it functioned as a research and isotope production plant only. According to Lev Kotchetkov, who was there at the time: \\"Although utilisation of generated heat was going on, and production of isotopes was even enhanced, the main task was to carry out experimental studies on 17 test loops installed in the reactor.\\" The technology perfected in the Obninsk pilot plant was later employed on a much larger scale in the RBMK reactors. Design The single reactor unit at the plant, AM-1 (\\"\\", Atom Mirny, Russian for \\"Peaceful Atom\\"), had a total electrical capacity of 6 MW and a net capacity of around 5 MWe. Thermal output was 30 MW. It was a prototype design using a graphite moderator and water coolant. This reactor was a forerunner of the RBMK reactors. The Obninsk reactor used 5% enriched uranium; this percentage would be lowered for subsequent reactors. History Construction started on 1 January 1951. First criticality was achieved on 6 May 1954, and the first grid connection was made on 27 June 1954. For around four years, until the opening of the Siberian Nuclear Power Station, Obninsk remained the only nuclear power reactor in the Soviet Union; the power plant remained active until 29 April 2002 when it was finally shut down. According to Kotchetkov, in its 48 years of operation there were no significant incidents resulting in personnel overdose or mortality, or radioactive release to the environment exceeding permissible limits. The next Soviet nuclear power plant to be connected to their grid was Beloyarsk Unit 1 in 1964 with a capacity of 100 MWe.

Politically active until age 90, Goodman came to wide public attention again in 2005. Traveling to Philadelphia, Mississippi, she testified at the murder trial of Edgar Ray Killen, a former Klan leader recently indicted in the case. On June 21, 2005, the 41st anniversary of the killings, a jury acquitted Killen of murder but found him guilty of manslaughter in the deaths of Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner. Early life and education Goodman was born in Woodmere, New York and earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1936 and a master's in clinical psychology from the City University of New York in 1953. She completed a doctorate in education from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1968. Her dissertation was titled A study of psychological factors in different fertility and family planning types. Arleen Otto was her doctoral advisor and Morton Deutsch served on her dissertation committee. Activism After her marriage to Robert W. Goodman, a civil engineer, in the late 1930s, their apartment became a haven for progressive artists and intellectuals. In the 1950s, the Goodmans were deeply involved in the fight against McCarthyism; Alger Hiss was a guest on occasion. In 1964, Andrew, then a student at Queens College, told his parents he planned to go to Mississippi. \\"It wasn't easy for us ... But we couldn't talk out of both sides of our mouths. So I had to let him go\\", she told The New York Times in 2005. =Murders= In 1967, a federal jury in Meridian, Mississippi convicted seven Klansmen of conspiracy in the deaths of the three civil rights workers. None served more than six years. In January 2005, Edgar Ray Killen, who in 1967 had been released due to a hung jury, was arrested and charged with murder by the State of Mississippi. At his trial, Goodman read a postcard her son wrote on June 21, 1964, the last day of his life > \\"Dear Mom and Dad,\\" it read, \\"I have arrived safely in Meridian, Miss. This > is a wonderful town, and the weather is fine. I wish you were here. The > people in this city are wonderful, and our reception was very good. All my > love, Andy.\\" = Andrew Goodman Foundation = In 1966, Carolyn and her husband Robert established the Andrew Goodman Foundation, which supports a variety of social causes. After Carolyn's death in August 2007, David Goodman, Andrew's younger brother, and Sylvia Golbin Goodman, David's wife, took up the work of the Foundation. On the 50th anniversary of Andrew's death, the foundation officially launched Vote Everywhere, which is a national, non-partisan, civic engagement movement of student leaders and university partners.https://andrewgoodman.org/vote-everywhere/ The program is crafted to follow in the footsteps of Andrew Goodman with its mission rooted in tackling impediments to voter registration and other social justice issues on college campuses. Personal life Her husband Robert Goodman died of a stroke in 1969, aged 54. Her second husband, Joseph Eisner, whom she had married in 1972, died in 1992. Goodman, who had suffered a series of strokes and seizures in the weeks before her death, died of natural causes in Manhattan, aged 91. At her death, she was assistant clinical professor emeritus of psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in The Bronx. She was surrounded by her sons, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. A memorial service was held on October 7, 2007 in Manhattan.Obituary, nytimes.com; August 18, 2007; accessed May 14, 2015.

He was a civil engineer and contractor working on roads, canals and ports first in England and later in Russia. English career His father, John Upton, was a surveyor to the George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont at Petworth House. The Earl took a great interest in road and waterway improvements. It seems probable that the young Upton gained basic engineering skills partly from his father and from working on schemes sponsored by the Earl. In 1815 he was working on the stalled project to build a canal from Gloucester to join the river Severn at Berkeley. He published a plan Observations on the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal. - Institution of Civil Engineers Archives London . that the canal should join the river at Sharpness rather than Berkeley - a plan that was eventually adopted. He was also working as a construction contractor, principally in South Wales.Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland. Vol 1 page 734.. Published 2002 Thomas Telford. By 1819 he had become surveyor for part of the London to Holyhead road running from Stoney Stratford, near Milton Keynes, to Dunchurch, Warwickshire under the overall direction of Thomas Telford who seems to have had a high regard for Upton's engineering skills.Gentleman's Magazine. January 1855 p 88-89 Criminal dealings In 1818 he was dismissed from the Gloucester and Sharpness canal project for improper procurement of construction materials. An audit of the Dunchurch road construction work in early 1826 showed that he had defrauded the project of over ¬£1,000. He was charged to appear at Northampton Assizes but was allowed bail. The day before his trial in July 1826 he absconded and made his way to the Russian legation in London who were keen to recruit engineers for their Black Sea expansion. Upton's assistant, Clement Clarke, stood trial but was sentenced to a modest 6 months imprisonment because he worked under direction.Northampton Mercury 8 July 1826 Not only had Upton defrauded the road project but he had also obtained ¬£3,000 from his wife's relations which he did not repay and had defaulted on his franchise for the Daventry post office leaving his surety to pay ¬£300. Russian career A plan of the docks, barracks, naval stores at Sevastopol Grafskaya Wharf in Sevastopol Lazarev Barracks, now Sevastopol branch of Moscow State University Upton was able to make Sevastopol harbour accessible to large ships where others had failed. He designed the water supply, road layout and many features of Sevastopol town and harbour including the Grafskaya Quay, He had been commissioned as an engineering officer and rose to the rank of Colonel Engineer. In Odessa he built the Primorsky Stairs designed earlier by a Russian architect. In Russia he was assisted by his sons John, William, Thomas and Samuel who went on to become an architect and Russian academician. John Upton worked extensively in Sevastopol to build a huge set of dry docks for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. These docks were completed just before the outbreak of the Crimean War. At the conclusion of the siege of Sevastopol, the Dry Docks were destroyed by British and French soldiers. During the Crimean War William Upton was held for a short time by the British military who hoped he would reveal details of Sevastopol harbour defences.Journal kept during the Russian War by Mrs H.

It is managed by Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. History The hospital has its origins in the Redruth Mines Infirmary, which was largely financed by Lord Robartes and completed in 1863. An accident ward was added in 1871. The West Cornwall Women's Hospital was completed on an adjacent site in 1899, and the two hospitals amalgamated in 1901. The amalgamated facility became the West Cornwall Miners and Women's Hospital in 1915 and the Camborne-Redruth Miners and General Hospital in 1940. It joined the National Health Service as the Camborne-Redruth Hospital in 1948 and, following a major redevelopment of the site in 2002, the old hospital building was converted into flats and the new medical facilities became known as the Camborne Redruth Community Hospital. Services The hospital has in- patient beds catering for rehabilitation and stroke, as well as a Minor Injuries Unit with X-ray facilities.

The title refers to the meaning behind the music of Alcest, as its leader and songwriter, Neige, sees it as a journey through his memories of a distant world he has been in contact with. Although it is representative of future works, the album differs greatly from Alcest's first release Le Secret, distancing itself further from Alcest's original, darker sound, and going more into post-metal and shoegaze-like direction. It is the last release in which Neige plays all instruments, as he was joined by drummer Winterhalter on subsequent releases. Reception The album received generally positive reviews. Brian Way of Allmusic lauded the emotional aspect of the album, stating it expressed \\"yearning, nostalgia, triumph and blissful peace, all without a single lyric in (discernible) English\\". Many reviewers noted the unique stylistic influences on the album, with Brad Angle of Revolver describing the album as \\"unexpectedly profound and affecting. Where many black metal records tunnel inward to the dark centers of their authors, Souvenirs d'un autre monde looks outward and upward, encouraging the listener to release its grasp on reality and float into the ether.\\" Kyle Ward of Sputnik Music was less impressed with the album, writing that \\"The ideas presented in Souvenirs d'un autre monde\\" are solid, and rather revolutionary for the genre, but the songwriting is so blatantly flawed that any hope of this fantastic idea coming to realization are swiftly carried away, never to return again.\\" In 2016, Pitchfork Media ranked the album at number 32 in its list of \\"The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time\\", saying: Track listing Personnel ; Alcest * Neige ‚Äì lead and backing vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards, drums ; Additional personnel * Audrey Sylvain ‚Äì vocals on \\"Sur l'autre rive je t'attendrai\\" * Fursy Teyssier ‚Äì Cover art References 2007 debut albums Alcest albums Profound Lore Records albums ","title":"Souvenirs d'un autre monde"},{"id":"12826368","text":"William Forrest (October 10, 1902 - January 26, 1989) was an American theatre, film, and television actor.William Forrest at Forgotten Actors Forest attended Princeton University, where he was a star in athletics.

He is probably most famous for scoring the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 victory for Cardiff City against Real Madrid in the first leg of the European Cup Winners Cup quarter-final in 1971. Career The son of former Bristol City player Don Clark, Clark captained Bristol Boys' before signing professional terms with Bristol City himself in March 1960, making his debut for the club in 1961 during a 3‚Äì0 victory over Brentford on the final day of the season. After featuring regularly for the Robins reserve side, it was during the 1962‚Äì63 season that he established himself in the side, finishing as the club's top scorer with 23 goals. He continued to score regularly for the side and helped the side gain promotion to Division Two during the 1964‚Äì65 season, forming a formidable attacking partnership with John Atyeo and Bobby Williams, again finishing as the club's top scorer with 24 goals. In October 1966 he left Bristol City to sign for Huddersfield Town in exchange for John Quigley. Clark failed to settle at the Yorkshire club and, after two years, was snapped up by Cardiff City manager Jimmy Scoular for ¬£8,000. Scoring twice on his debut during a 4‚Äì3 win over Derby County, he went on to form a lethal partnership with John Toshack, ending the season with 17 goals and his first Welsh Cup winners medal. Clark finished as the club's top scorer for the next two seasons, as well as scoring 5 times in a single match against Barmouth & Dyffryn, falling short of Derek Tapscott's club record of goals in a game by just one. It was during the 1970‚Äì71 season that he achieved probably the high point of his career when he headed in the only goal of the first leg against Real Madrid in a 1‚Äì0 win during the European Cup Winners Cup quarter-final. The following year he again finished as Cardiff's top scorer, the third successive year he had done so, before he and Ian Gibson were surprisingly sold to Bournemouth for a combined fee of ¬£100,000. Clark spent one year at Bournemouth, followed by a spell at Millwall. He soon returned to Ninian Park to play for Cardiff again. His second spell at the club lasted just a single season but he still managed to help the club win promotion to Division Two. He left the club to sign for Newport County before finishing his career with a number of player-manager roles at several Welsh Football League sides. Death Clark died on 10 August 2010 at the age of 67 from Lewy body dementia at Whitchurch Hospital in Cardiff.

Youth Robert Ketcham was born in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, USA, to Charles O. and Sarah Bullock Ketcham, active members of the local Methodist Church. Charles was a small farmer and milkman. Sarah Ketcham died when Robert was seven, and his father married a widow, Louise Elliot. Because Louise was a Baptist, the family then joined the Baptist church. When Robert was eleven, the family moved a bit more than twenty miles west to Galeton, PennsylvaniaJ. Murray Murdoch, Portrait of Obedience: The Biography of Robert T. Ketcham (Schaumburg, Illinois: Regular Baptist Press, 1979), 20-21. Early ministry At sixteen, Robert, a stubborn young man who disliked his parents' discipline, quit high school and left home.Murdoch, 22-23. Nevertheless, in 1910 he was converted at the Galeton Baptist Church and, despite his lack of formal education, was called in 1912 to pastor the tiny First Baptist Church, Roulette, Pennsylvania, on the Allegheny River. (There were thirty-three members, twenty-eight of them women.)Murdoch, 32. Roulette was a village, but its religious and political demographics were unusual. For instance, the town had many Seventh-day Adventists and Spiritualists, and the majority of its voters were socialists. (Eugene Debs had spoken there.)Murdoch, 37. Ketcham, who was studious by inclination, read extensively to understand and refute these opposing ideologies.Murdoch, 38. He also began taking a correspondence course from Crozer Theological Seminary but gave it up during his second year when he detected theological liberalism in an assigned text.Murdoch, 39-40. Meanwhile, Ketcham's eyesight began to fail with keratoconus. Although he could read with a book pressed almost to his nose, he began to memorize scripture so as not to call attention to his loss of sight while in the pulpit. After one service, a deacon dryly told him that he had read the scripture flawlessly while holding the Bible upside down.Murdoch, 41. Ketcham was virtually blind for most of his career although he continued to read printed material with a magnifying glass and in the pulpit used rudimentary notes written in very large letters on black paper with a white grease pencil.Murdoch, 41, 214. Ketcham continued to avoid photographs that would call attention to his poor eyesight. For instance, a photograph in Murdoch portrays him reading a book at a normal distance without glasses, although there is a large magnifying glass visible in the picture.(188) Ketcham‚Äôs pastorate in Roulette was extremely successful, and many converts were added to the church. During an evangelistic campaign in 1914, four hundred people made professions of faith, about the same number as the population of the town. In 1915, Ketcham was reluctantly ordained by a local Baptist council despite his fundamentalist beliefs and lack of formal education.Murdoch, 48. Bob Jones University conferred an honorary doctorate on Ketcham in 1961. The same year he accepted the call to the Baptist church of Brookeville, Pennsylvania, where he contracted influenza during the pandemic of 1918.Murdoch, 61-62. Fundamentalist leader In 1919, Ketcham became pastor of the First Baptist Church of Butler, Pennsylvania, where he became more active in defense of orthodox Christianity especially by opposing liberal tendencies in the Northern Baptist Convention. When the Convention launched a \\"New World Movement\\" to create a \\"civilization Christian in spirit,\\" Ketcham wrote a pamphlet with the unpromising title, \\"A Statement of the First Baptist Church Butler, Pennsylvania, with Reference to The New World Movement and the $100,000,000 Drive (1919).\\" Soon after the pamphlet was published, Ketcham received a visit from officers of the Pittsburgh Baptist Association, who made it clear that if Ketcham did not retract the pamphlet, he would never get another pastorate in the Northern Baptist Convention; one member of the committee shook Ketcham by the collar and \\"roared that Ketchan owed God an apology.\\"Joel A. Carpenter, Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), 51. Leading fundamentalist William Bell Riley, pastor of the First Baptist Church, Minneapolis, saw the pamphlet and ordered 20,000 copies.Murdoch, 66-67, 74-75. The essay was widely distributed and it \\"established the young pastor as an articulate spokesman for Fundamentalism.\\"David O. Beale, In Pursuit of Purity: American Fundamentalism Since 1850 (Greenville, SC: Bob Jones University Press, 274. Shortly thereafter, his wife, Clara, died of tuberculosis, leaving him with the care of two young daughters.Murdoch, 80-81. In 1922, Ketcham married Mary Smart of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania,The paper mills of Lock Haven inspired Ketcham‚Äôs most popular series of sermons, \\"The High Cost of Writing Paper.\\" and this marriage endured for more than fifty years.Murdoch, 91. They had one son together, who later became a missionary doctor in Bangladesh. For their honeymoon, Ketcham took his new wife to the annual meeting of the National Baptist Convention, where for twelve years, he and other fundamentalists in the Northern Baptist Convention unsuccessfully attempted to wrest control of the organization from moderates and liberals. In 1923, the conservatives formed the Baptist Bible Union, an unsuccessful attempt to unite fundamentalist Baptists, and Ketcham became a member of the executive committee.See Kent Berghuis, \\"The GARBC as Heir of the Baptist Bible Union: A Case Study in 20th Century Fundamentalism\\" Reclaimingthemind.org The same year, Ketcham also moved to Ohio to pastor successively Baptist churches in Niles and Elyria. General Association of Regular Baptist Churches Although Ketcham did not attend the first meeting of the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches (GARBC) in 1932, he was elected vice-president in 1933 and president in 1934. Ketcham successfully campaigned for a looser fellowship of churches rather than a reestablishment of the boards and agencies of the Northern Baptist Convention.Murdoch, 131-32. He also successfully insisted that membership in the GARBC be open only to churches who first severed their ties with the Convention.Murdoch, 133. By this time Ketcham had assumed the pastorate of the Central Baptist Church of Gary, Indiana, and in 1934 he pulled the church out of the Northern Baptist Convention by emphasizing its ties to both religious and political liberalism.Murdoch, 137-39. Ketcham served as president of the GARBC from 1934 to 1938 and then restructured the organization to place control in a Council of 14. Nevertheless, \\"for the next 30 years, he shaped the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches.\\"J. Gordon Melton, ed. Religious Leaders of America, second ed. (Detroit: Gale Group, 1999), 299. He served as national representative of the association from 1946 to 1960, and he edited the denominational organ, The Baptist Bulletin (1938‚Äì1945, 1946‚Äì1955) while pastoring the Walnut Street Baptist Church of Waterloo, Iowa, the largest Baptist Church in the state.Melton, 299. In 1944, Ketcham was elected president of the fundamentalist American Council of Christian Churches, which he believed might be an effective counter to the Federal Council of Churches of Christ (later the National Council of Churches), which claimed to speak for all of Protestant Christianity in the United States. During the 1930s and '40s, Ketcham was dogged by repeated attacks from J. Frank Norris, an influential fundamentalist from Texas with a reputation for making vicious personal assaults.Murdoch, 179. A one-time Norris associate, Beauchamp Vick, called Norris \\"ruthless\\" and noted that he once said, \\"I fight dirty.\\" Norris was miffed that he had not been allowed to join the GARBC, which Ketcham and other leaders thought he might try to manipulate for the benefit of his own programs and eccentric personality.Beale, 275. In the pages of his Fundamentalist, Norris even attacked Ketcham's daughter, Lois Moffat, for having left the mission field, although she had arrived in the United States near death and remained hospitalized and gravely ill for months. Eventually Ketcham's Waterloo church offered to put all its resources at his disposal so that he could sue Norris for libel and slander. Ketcham replied, \\"I cannot take a man into court whom I have been taking to the court of high Heaven now for several years.\\"Murdoch, 206. Decline and death In 1959 Ketcham had a major heart attack and nearly died.Murdoch, 258-59. Both his physical strength and his eyesight continued to decline. He preached less frequently through the 1960s, sometimes while sitting on a stool.Murdoch, 289. One of his last messages was given in February 1974. In both 1976 and 1978, he suffered severe strokes, the latter of which left him bedridden and without the ability to speak. Ketcham died on August 20, 1978.Murdoch, 292. Personality Because of his fearlessness in defending his fundamentalist beliefs, Ketcham was sometimes called \\"Fighting Bob,\\" a name he \\"disliked intensely.\\"Murdoch, 247. His personality was actually irenic, and his son later said that when Ketcham believed that he had no choice but to fight, he would literally cry himself to sleep.Murdoch, 247-48. Although he refused to maintain any connection with religious liberals, whom he believed had deprecated Jesus Christ, Ketcham maintained friendly relations with other evangelicals with whom he had serious differences. For instance, in 1954, Alan Redpath, pastor of Moody Memorial Church, issued a statement declaring that liberals and fundamentalists should unite \\"in one great army for Christ.\\" Ketcham was horrified, but he conducted a respectful written exchange with Redpath for almost five years, concluding with the statement, \\"Forget me as a critic Brother Redpath, and think of me only as a brother in Christ pleading with you to pull away from these entangling alliances before you wind up with Jehoshaphat.\\"Murdoch, 245-47. Although evangelist Percy Crawford generally disliked fundamentalists who directed attacks at other believers, he and Ketcham developed a lifelong \\"friendship and mutual affection,\\" in part because Ketcham had \\"an unassuming manner\\" and a \\"fun-loving spirit.\\"Dan D. Crawford, A Thirst for Souls: The Life of Evangelist Percy B. Crawford (1902-1960) (Selinsgrove, PA: Susquehanna University Press, 2010), 138-140. In the 1960s Ketcham pleaded with his long- time friend Carl McIntire to \\"be more gracious in his dealings with other Christians,\\" although McIntire instead used his Christian Beacon to attack members of the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches.Murdoch, 286-87; Beale, 275-76.

Aside from the group's biggest hits to date, cover versions of songs by Stevie Wonder (\\"Living For The City\\"), Elton John (\\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\") were performed, as well as a rendition of the Jimmy Webb penned track \\"Everybody Gets To Go The Moon\\" from the film The French Connection. The album was re- issued on CD in 2010 by Demon Music Group on the Edsel label and features the original artwork. The original vinyl release credits the recording to be taken from a performance at Bailey's, London, England. This credit has been corrected on the digital re-issue.

It was released by Tracey Edmonds' label Yab Yum Records and distributed by Epic Records subsidiary 550 Music on September 16, 1997. Background and recording Cool Relax was the follow-up to his 1995 debut Bonafide. Jon assumed the role of having more creative control on his second album. On his debut, he was given leeway to write and produce, but Edmonds and her then-husband Babyface were heavily involved in the making of Bonafide. Jon was confident in the material for his new album, but fought with Edmonds and Babyface over certain songs to keep on the project. Aside from his work, Jon sought outside production from Tim & Bob, Johnny J, David Foster and Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest, among others. The song that became the first single \\"Don't Say\\", was written by former Boyz II Men and Az Yet member Marc Nelson. Jon overheard Nelson playing the song in the record company's parking lot and asked to record it for his album. The music video for the single featured a then-unknown Sanaa Lathan as the female love interest. \\"They Don't Know\\" was released as the next single, with a music video directed by Christopher Erskin. The song's B-side \\"Are U Still Down\\" was also issued despite objections from the record company, as it featured vocals from the then-deceased Tupac Shakur who died when Jon started recording the album. Jon received assistance from Shakur's mother Afeni Shakur, who gave Jon permission to clear his vocals for the song. He would record a sequel to \\"Are U Still Down\\" called \\"Part 2\\" with a posthumous appearance by Shakur on his 2004 album Stronger Everyday. The next single was the song \\"I Do (Whatcha Say Boo)\\". The song originally appeared on his demo tape prior to recording Bonafide- as did the album track \\"Can We Get Down\\". The final single was the title track, which had a remix that featured Guru from the hip hop group Gang Starr. The song was produced by Ali Shaheed Muhammad, who Jon sought out due to being a longtime fan of A Tribe Called Quest. \\"Pride & Joy\\" was originally recorded by Toni Braxton for her sophomore album Secrets, but the song never made the final track listing. Jon later recorded the song for himself, while giving her the song \\"In the Late of Night\\" for her album. The last song on Cool Relax- \\"Tu Amor\\"- was penned by songwriter Diane Warren. Jon felt the song didn't fit in with the rest of the album and was done at the request of Epic Records in seeing the potential of the song becoming a huge hit. Almost a decade later, the song would be covered by Mexican pop group RBD for their English language album Rebels. One song that didn't make the track list was \\"Paradise in U\\". A little over a decade later, he included the song on his 2008 album Helpless Romantic. Track listing Credits adapted from liner notesJon B. - Cool Relax. Yab Yum Records/550 Music.

At the last measurements, made in 1987, its dimensions are: the lake lies on a perimeter of 2,830 m, the area is 114.676 m¬≤Gheorghe Romanescu, Cristian Constantin Stoleriu and Andrei Enea and the volume of water that accumulates is 587.503 m¬≥. The lake was formed at an altitude of 983 m, in a depression with a predominant subalpine climate. Location Location Red Lake The Red Lake is located between Suhardul Mic, Suhardul Mare on the north side, Southwest Podu Calului Mountains, Lica»ô Mountains and Kis-Havas Mountains in the northwest, Cs√≠ki-B√ºkk in the north- east and Muntele Uciga»ô (The Killer Mount) in the eastern part. The lake is powered by four large streams and 12 temporary water courses, of which the most important are Verescheul (The Red), Lica≈ü, Suhardul, Uciga»ôul(The Killer). Lake formation Although the Red Lake is a young formation, the conditions and time of the lake formation are very much discussed. During the forming, the lake area was a hardly accessible area, economically unexplored. According to Franz Herbich, Red Lake was formed in 1838. This is also justified by the earthquake of January 23, 1838, which was repeated in February and could have caused a landslide. Another year of forming is 1837, which can be argued by very violent storms and heavy rains. About this period writes Ditr√≥i Pusk√°s Ferenc in his work, \\"The History of Borsec\\". It is essential that the lake was formed by moving the clay mass deposited during the last ice age on the north-western slope of Mount Ghilco≈ü. Soon after the valley had been closed, the fir forest was flooded, and the trees were petrified, giving a rare peculiarity to the whole landscape. In the first years of forming, the lake has expanded further - about a kilometer higher in the valley of the stream, but over time the natural dam eroded, the water level stabilizing at the current level. Tourism The surroundings of the lake have a pleasant microclimate, particularly beneficial for the treatment of physical and mental exhaustion, insomnia, neurasthenia. The average multiannual temperature is 8¬∞C, above the 6¬∞C average of the intramontane depressions. The valley is virtually free of winds, very clean air rich in natural aerosols, scenic surroundings provide excellent conditions for those who are seeking for sources of rapid regeneration naturally. Since the 1900s, it has been the recreational spa tourism that has brought development to the tourist services of this area.

He was the younger brother of fellow footballer Frank O'Donnell. The siblings stayed together for the first sixteen years of their careers, both playing concurrently for Celtic,Celtic player O'Donnell, Hugh, FitbaStats Preston North End and Blackpool. O'Donnell made over one hundred league appearances for Preston between 1935 and 1938, scoring 29 goals, before signing for the club's arch-rivals, Blackpool. He made his debut for Blackpool in a goalless draw with Bolton Wanderers at Bloomfield Road on 18 March 1939. He went on to play in the remaining nine games of the season, in the number-11 shirt, and scored their goal in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Arsenal on 10 April 1939. The following season, 1939‚Äì40, was the first season of regional competitions, brought about by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. O'Donnell's final game in a Blackpool shirt took place on 23 November 1946, in a 4‚Äì2 defeat at Leeds United, his only appearance of the season. He scored the first of Blackpool's goals.

Hernandulcin is an intensely sweet chemical compound gained from the chiefly Mexican and South American plant Lippia dulcis. History and origin In the 1570s, Spanish physician Francisco Hern√°ndez described a remarkably sweet plant known to the Aztecs as Tzonpelic xihuitl, meaning \\"sweet herb\\". This reference, accompanied by an accurate description and illustration of the plant, led to a group of pharmacognocists in 1985 to a previously unrecognised, intensely sweet chemical that can provide sweetness without tooth decay. Cesar M. Compadre, and A. Douglas Kinghorn, from the University of Illinois at Chicago isolated and identified the sweet compound from the leaves and flowers of the Lippia dulcis plant, in Mexico. The researchers noted the chemical structure of the colourless oil, and named it hernandulcin after Francisco Hernandez.  Structure  Hernandulcin is a sesquiterpene with the molecular formula C15H24O2. By slightly modifying the compound, researchers have identified the three parts of the chemical structure that produced the intense sweet taste - the carbonyl group, the hydroxyl group, and the hydrophobic side chain. Hernandulcin was the first sesquiterpene found to be sweet, and after a panel of volunteers tasted hernandulcin, it was determined that it was more than 1,000 times sweeter than sugar. Hernandulcin also has a minty aftertaste, and does not cause tooth decay, which would make it a good candidate for oral hygiene products.

Station's history Originally, the broadcasting licence was awarded to Alt Services, an organisation created by Alternattiva Demokratika, a nascent local political party that espouses environmentally responsible policies. In fact the radio station, originally called \\"Radju Alternattiva,\\" started out as a political radio station, competing with other local political radios such as Radio 101 and the state's radio stations. On July 1, 1998 the radio station changed its name to \\"Capital Radio\\", significantly toned down its political activities, and focused more on 1980s music. In time, political broadcasts ceased entirely. At the time, the management of the radio station was in the hands of Mediacoop Ltd, a media cooperative. Mediacoop's Managing Director is [John Mallia]. In July 2005, Mediacoop bought the station's license from its previous owners Alt Services and so came to own the station as well. Since October 2005 Capital Radio has been housed in a state of the art complex in St. Ursula Street, Valletta. Mediacoop stopped broadcasting as of 00:00 of Wednesday, 1 April 2009, after it agreed to transfer its broadcasting license to new operators. Mediacoop said that it wanted to focus more on other aspects of its commercial portfolio. Since then, Capital Radio continued to transmit non-stop music from all pop generes from the 1980s up to the 2000s, until the new management took over and began its own broadcasting. Programming With a heavy focus on 1980s music, Capital Radio was quite popular with listeners in the 25-45 age bracket. Capital Radio had a strong presenter line up. Capital Radio also organised social events, such as the station's birthday bash every summer. Capital Radio was also popular abroad, with thousands of listeners tuning in over the net.

In Michigan, it is a state trunkline highway that enters the state south of Coldwater and passes the cities of Lansing and Flint in the Lower Peninsula. A north‚Äìsouth freeway from the Indiana‚ÄìMichigan border to the Lansing area, it changes direction to east‚Äìwest after running concurrently with I-96. The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of the twin-span Blue Water Bridge while running concurrently with I-94 at the border. There are four related business loops for I-69 in the state, connecting the freeway to adjacent cities. Predecessors to I-69 include the first M-29, US Highway 27 (US 27), M-78 and M-21. The freeway was not included on the original Interstate Highway System planning maps in the mid-1950s, but it was added in 1958 along a shorter route. Michigan built segments of freeway for the future Interstate in the 1960s, and the state was granted additional Interstate mileage in 1968 to extend I-69 north and east to Flint. Later extensions in 1973 and 1987 resulted in the modern highway. The first freeway segment designated as I-69 in Michigan opened in 1967, and the last was completed in 1992, finishing Michigan's Interstate System. US 27 previously ran concurrently with I-69 from the Indiana‚ÄìMichigan state line north to the Lansing area, but this designation was removed in 2002. Route description The entirety of I-69 is listed on the National Highway System, which is a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The freeway carries 91,100 vehicles on average each day between I-475 and M-54 in Flint and 14,085 vehicles between M-53 and Capac Road near the Lapeer‚ÄìSt. Clair county line, the highest and lowest traffic counts in 2012, respectively. I-69 carries the Lake Huron Circle Tour in the Port Huron area and the I-69 Recreational Heritage Route from the Indiana state line north to the Calhoun‚ÄìEaton county line. I-69 is mostly a four-lane freeway in the state of Michigan, with exceptions in the Lansing and Flint metro areas where it is six lanes and in Port Huron where it is three lanes westbound and three lanes eastbound until eastbound traffic splits into six lanes of local traffic to Port Huron and two lanes to the Blue Water Bridge. =Northward to Lansing= alt=Photograph I-69 in Michigan begins at the Indiana state line southeast of Kinderhook and just north of an interchange with the Indiana Toll Road, which carries I-80 and I-90. From there, I-69 runs northward through a mixture of Southern Michigan farmland and woodland in Branch County. A few miles north of the state line, the freeway passes Coldwater Lake State Park and its namesake body of water; north of the lake, there is a welcome center for the northbound lanes. I-69 curves around the east side of Coldwater, connecting to the city's business loop on the south of town. Immediately east of downtown, the freeway intersects the northern end of the business loop at an interchange that also features US 12 (Chicago Road). Farther north, the freeway turns to the northwest, crosses into Calhoun County and then over the St. Joseph River. I-69 turns back northward and bypasses Tekonsha to the town's west, intersecting M-60 in the process. Curving around Nottawa Lake, I-69 continues northward through southern Calhoun County. It passes through an interchange that marks the southern terminus of M-227, a highway that connects northward into Marshall. The freeway crosses the Kalamazoo River and passes through an interchange with M-96 west of downtown Marshall. From that interchange northward, the BL I-94 designation is overlaid on I-69; the business loop ends at the cloverleaf interchange northwest of Marshall that marks the first of I-69's two junctions with I-94 in the state . North of I-94, I-69 has one more interchange at N Drive North before crossing into Eaton County. alt=Aerial photograph In southern Eaton County, the freeway parallels the Battle Creek River north of the junction with M-78. Near Olivet, I-69 begins to turn in a northeasterly direction and curves around the north side of town. On the south side of Charlotte, I-69 turns northward, traversing an area to the east of downtown and crossing the former routing of US 27, which is now part of the business loop for the city. Farther north, the freeway has a junction with M-50, a bridge over the Battle Creek River, and an interchange with the northern end of the business loop next to Fitch H. Beach Airport. North of the airport, I-69 turns northeasterly again and parallels Lansing Road, the former route of US 27/M-78. The freeway meets the southern end of M-100 near Potterville and continues into the Lansing‚ÄìEast Lansing metropolitan area. Southwest of the state's capital city, I-69 crosses over Lansing Road near Lansing Delta Township Assembly, a factory for General Motors; northeast of the complex, I-69 merges into I-96. The combined I-96/I-69 runs northward through the suburban edges of the Lansing area, intersecting the western ends of I-496 and the BL I-69 for Lansing. The freeway enters Clinton County, and just north of a crossing of the Grand River, I-69 turns eastward to separate from I-96. As a part of the larger interchange with I-96, I-69 crosses BL I-96 (Grand River Avenue) without any connections. =Eastward to Port Huron= After leaving the I-96 concurrency, I-69 changes cardinal orientation and is signed as east‚Äìwest from that point on. The freeway continues parallel to the Looking Glass River through suburban areas north of Capital Region International Airport. North of East Lansing, I-69 meets US 127 at a cloverleaf interchange. East of that junction, I-69 turns southeasterly passing the Hawk Hollow Golf Course and Park Lake on the way to meet the eastern end of BL I-69 just north of Lake Lansing. I-69 then turns northeasterly parallel to Lansing Road (Old M-78) to enter Shiawassee County. The freeway continues through Central Michigan farmlands, jogging north of Perry and Bancroft. alt=Photograph At Durand, I-69 meets the southeastern end of M-71 on the northwest side of town. The freeway turns sharply to the northeast before turning due east near Lennon. The interchange with M-13 south of Lennon marks the Shiawassee‚ÄìGenesee county line. Continuing eastward, I-69 parallels Miller Road to the north as far as the city of Swartz Creek; east of town, the two roadways cross. I-69 parallels a line of the Canadian National Railway as it enters the Flint metro area. The freeway intersects Bristol Road near the Bishop International Airport and then crosses I-75/US 23 southwest of downtown Flint. I-69, the railroad and the Swartz Creek all parallel into downtown Flint where the freeway intersects I-475 and M-54 (Dort Highway) before exiting the east side of the city. I-69 runs eastward out of Flint parallel to the railroad. At Davison, it intersects M-15 before crossing into Lapeer County. In this area, the freeway traverses farmlands in the southern part of the region called The Thumb. It jogs to the north around Lake Nepessing, which is southwest of Lapeer. The freeway continues through farmland to Imlay City, where it meets M-53 before crossing into western St. Clair County. I-69 continues eastward through an interchange with M-19 at Emmett. alt=Aerial photograph Near Wadhams, I-69 curves around to the north to follow part of the Black River. On the east side of the community, the freeway turns back to the southeast as it enters the western edge of the Port Huron suburbs. I-69 turns again to run due eastward to intersect I-94. The two freeways merge in an interchange that also has connections to BL I-69. The freeway curves to the north and back around to the east to cross the Black River. On the eastern bank, I-94/I-69 travels through one more interchange, this one for M-25 and BL I-69/BL I-94. Past the interchange, the freeway crosses through the toll and customs plazas for the twin-span Blue Water Bridge. The I-69 designation officially ends at the international boundary in the middle of the St. Clair River where it connects with Highway 402. History =Predecessor highways= alt=Map The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the Indian trails. None of these followed the path of the modern I-69 however. The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13, 1913, by an act of the Michigan Legislature; at the time, none of the system's divisions corresponded to the modern I-69 either. In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) was required to signpost the highway system for the first time, and the state became the second after Wisconsin to do so. At the time, two different highways followed sections of the modern I-69 corridor. The original M-29 ran from the Indiana state line north to Charlotte and turned northeasterly to Lansing. The second highway was M-21 from Flint east to Goodells, a community west of Port Huron; the highway was extended to Port Huron by 1924. On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), and the new US 27 replaced M-29 from the state line northward to Lansing. By the end of the next year, M-78 was extended from Charlotte north and east of Lansing to a junction with M-47 near Pittsburg, north of the modern I-69. The section of M-78 north of Lansing was changed in 1929; the segment from Dewitt to Pittsburg was redesignated M-104, and M-78 was rerouted along a more southerly path through East Lansing to Haslett. By 1936, M-78 was extended from Haslett all the way into Flint to end at M-21. The first span of the Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario, in 1938. =Interstate Highway era= alt=Map The first planning maps from 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System did not include a highway along I-69's route; instead a highway further west connecting South Bend, Indiana, with Kalamazoo was included. This alternative highway was maintained on the 1955 plan for the \\"National System of Interstate and Defense Highways\\", and numbered I-67 in August 1957. By June 1958, this freeway had been shifted further east and renumbered I-69, connecting Indianapolis, Indiana, with Marshall; no connections north and east to Lansing, Flint or Port Huron were planned as part of the Interstate Highway System. Around the same time, a section of M-146 near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the Blue Water Bridge. By the middle of 1960, the first section of freeway along M-78 was opened in the Lennon area. The next year, the freeway had been extended as far southwest as Durand from the end at Lennon. Also in 1961, the MSHD had proposed that the section of US 27 south of Lansing be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead. alt=Map By the start of 1962, M-78 was a freeway from Perry at the junction with M-47 all the way to Swartz Creek near Flint. On December 12, 1962, I-96 was completed around the Lansing area, and M-78 was rerouted to follow it. A year later, I-496 was partially opened through the Lansing area, and M-78 was routed to follow it as well; the former route through downtown was redesignated Business M-78 (Bus. M-78). Around the same time, I-94 was extended along the Blue Water Bridge approach freeway. The first freeway segment of M-21 on the east end was built from Wadhams to Port Huron in 1966. The next year, M-78's freeway was extended eastward to I-75/US 10/US 23 in Flint. On October 11, 1967, the first segment of I-69/US 27 was scheduled to open between the Indiana state line and Tekonsha. By the end of the year, the freeway extended north to I-94 northwest of Marshall. The MSHD requested additional Interstate Highway mileage in 1968 under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 including an extension of I-69 from Marshall to Port Huron; this extension was approved as far as I-75/US 23 in Flint on December 13, 1968. A discontinuous section of M-78 freeway east of Flint was completed in 1969. The same year, I-475 was named the David Dunbar Buick Freeway, after the founder of Buick Motor Company in Flint; the same legislation, House Concurrent Resolution 22 of 1969 named the M-78 freeway through Flint for Louis Chevrolet. In 1970, the I-496 freeway was completed and the Bus. M-78 designation was removed through Lansing. A freeway segment between Flint and Lapeer opened in 1971. M-21 was routed down M-13 to the new freeway where it joined the M-78 designation from M-13 east. The section of M-21 formerly between M-13 and Bus. M-54 was redesignated M-56. The M-78 designation was replaced by I-69 in 1973 after a Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69) designation was extended northward from Charlotte through Lansing to Perry. On September 4 of that year, I-69's designation was officially extended by Congress to end at I-475 on the east side of Flint; this extension, and all subsequent ones, was of non-chargeable mileage, or segments not financed through the Interstate Highway fund. In 1980, a Flint-area politician wanted to dedicate a highway after the United Auto Workers (UAW). As a result, the David Dunbar Buick Freeway name was moved off I-475 and applied to I-69 in Flint. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the extension of the I-69 designation eastward in 1983 so it would terminate at the international boundary at Port Huron; this approval was contingent on construction of the roadway to Interstate Highway standards and other appropriate approvals at the federal government level. The remaining segment of freeway connecting Lapeer with Wadhams opened in 1984 as I-69 and several additional changes were made to the highway system at the same time. M-21 was shortened to Flint and replaced M-56 through the city. The former route of M-21 in Port Huron became BL I-69, and the remainder of that highway was turned back to local control. The I-69 designation was officially extended once more under Congressional legislation on February 10, 1987; this last extension designated I-69 all the way to I-94 in Port Huron to reflect the 1984 openings. Another segment of freeway opened in 1987 in Clinton County between US 127 near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near Bath. This section was connected to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991. The final segment of I-69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when the ribbon was cut by Governor John Engler. This segment marked the last in the state to complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US 27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit 87) and then concurrent with US 127 to exit 89 before running alone to Port Huron. =Since completion= A second span of the Blue Water Bridge between Port Huron and Point Edward opened in July 1997. The St. Johns Bypass on US 27 opened on August 31, 1998; US 27 was extended along I-69 about to the connect to the bypass, and US 127 was simultaneously removed from I-69. The next year, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. alt=Photograph On July 23, 2001, the Michigan Legislature declared that I-69 from exit 105 in Shiawassee County east to exit 135 in Genesee County would be named the Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway. In October 2001, the legislature consolidated the various legislation that created memorial highway designations in the state. Public Act 142 of 2001 extended the merged Chevrolet‚ÄìBuick Freeway name to all of I-69 in Genesee County, and restored the David Dunbar Buick Freeway name to I-475. The I-69 Recreational Heritage Route (now a Pure Michigan Byway) was created on October 8, 2004, to follow the freeway in Branch and Calhoun counties. The Branch County segment was also dedicated as the Purple Heart Trail on July 17, 2006. In 2011, construction began to widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge, a project completed in 2012. The widening project added dedicated lanes for local traffic and for Blue Water Bridge traffic with a new permanent welcome center opened in 2015, replacing the temporary one near Capac. The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area, especially those with outdated GPS devices, a problem first noted as the department was preparing to reopen the freeway in October 2012. As a result, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake. In late 2013, construction began to reconstruct and reconfigure the I-94/I-69 interchange near Port Huron. The project will improve of freeway, replace several bridges and ramps and cost $76 million. In June 2014, MDOT closed the ramps from I-69 eastbound to BL I-69 through the interchange until later in the year. The project was completed in September 2015. Exit list Business loops In Michigan, I-69 currently has four business loops. These highways, each designated Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69), provide access from the main freeway through the downtown districts of adjacent cities. They follow former routings used by I-69's predecessor highways (US 27, M-78 and M-21) as well connecting roads. The cities served by these loops are: Coldwater, Charlotte, Lansing, and Port Huron.

He was a controversial Lieutenant-governor of Menorca. Early life Anstruther was born about 1680, the only son of Sir Philip Anstruther of Airdrie and his wife Katherine Skene daughter of John Skene of Hallyards, Fife. His father died in 1682. He joined the army and was a Captain and Lieutenant-colonel in the 1st Foot Guards in 1710. Career Anstruther was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Anstruther Burghs at the 1715 general election. He was still an active army officer and was made colonel of the 26th Foot (Cameronians) in 1720 holding the rank until his death. At the 1722 general election there was a contest at Anstruther with a double return, but he was declared elected on 27 October 1722. He was returned at Anstruther unopposed at the general election in 1727. In 1733 he was appointed Lieutenant-governor of Menorca, but was still returned unopposed as MP for Anstruther at the 1734 general election. Anstruther became a brigadier-general in 1735. His only vote in the 1734 Parliament was in 1737, when he was the only Scottish MP to support government reprisals against Edinburgh over the Porteous Riots. This made him an object of detestation among his countrymen and rendered it difficult for him to go about Edinburgh openly. He became a major-general in 1739 but in 1741 was called before the House of Lords to explain his long absence from duty and the poor morale among his troops in Menorca. He had been defeated at the 1741 general election and received no support from his colleagues for a petition. After his return to Menorca, in 1742 he court-martialled his subordinate, Henry Erskine, for a supposed conspiracy against him. Erskine was acquitted but remained his bitter political enemy. During the Forty-five Rebellion, Anstruther served under General Ligonier and became a Lieutenant-General. However by 1747 his military command at Menorca was incompatible with holding a seat in the House of Commons, and he resigned to stand for Anstruther Burghs at the 1747 general election. Anstruther was returned as MP for Anstruther Burghs but much of his time in Parliament was spent defending his activities at Menorca. A report of a committee of the Privy Council concluded he \\"in many instances acted in an arbitrary and unwarrantable manner to the great injury and oppression of many of your Majesty's subjects there in breach of his duty to your Majesty and contrary to the constitution of the island.\\" He was also under attack from Erskine, now in Parliament. Erskine decided to attack him directly by standing for Parliament at Anstruther Burghs in the 1754 general election. Defeated by Erskine, Anstruther, at the age of 74, did not petition. Death and legacy Anstruther died unmarried on 11 November 1760. He left his estate at Airdrie to his cousin, Sir John Anstruther, 2nd Baronet.

They were part of a group of 119 men, 20 women, and 25 children from Iraq, Iran, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\" They also provided a list of victims who were hospitalised or seriously traumatised: *Necati Zontul, 36: beaten and raped by a Coast Guard officer *Ardal [or Erdan] Akgun, age 17: extensive inflammation on the right side of his chest. *Ozgan Eshik, age 17: swelling of his right elbow *Hanafi Alton, age 36: large bruise across his chest. *Bulent Sahin, age 27: complains of acute deafness in his right ear. *Halil Gilgil, age 20: severe abdominal pain *Farhad Damir, age 18, large haematoma [large swelling of clotted blood] in the back of his left thigh. *Gehad Korlalg, age 26, complains of head injury and has two bruises [one 10 cm long and the other 40 cm long] *Khalid Bagish, age 29, bruise on the right abdomen and two bruises around his armpits. *Mehmet Nuri Aktay, age 29: complains of pain when moving his left arm and has bruises on the left side of his back. *Rahme [Rahmi] Tunc, age 29, four bruises on his back.Athens News: 27 February 2004, Kathy Tzilivakis Since the publication of this summary, further evidence has surfaced of other victims, who for one reason or another failed to testify. Specifically, another (Kurd) victim called Yussef, who alleges rape and talks of Russian roulette and mock executions. Necati's original evidence given to translator Lisa Turkuman was seriously condensed and essentially faulty. On the basis of this and an interview with the Greek Helsinki Monitor in October 2001, Amnesty recorded in its report of 2002 that Necati \\"changed his evidence\\". He insists he did no such thing, and indeed at the trial in 2004, the commander of the unit testified against his own men and seems to corroborate Necati's story. Recently, Amnesty International Secretariat admitted, that the staff at the Athens Office had resigned and that they had perhaps relied too much on information about the case that had come from only one source. Indeed, from the first television interview to Tempo TV he gave in October 2001, when footage was intercut with scenes from Basic Instinct, there seems to have been an effort to discredit Necati. When Christodoulos, the Archbishop of Athens, was approached for help in 2003, he went on national television that evening to say \\"All Turks are barbarians.\\" Christodoulos has never publicly condemned the rise in racist agitation and its apparent links with the Greek Orthodox Church. The MEP Bill Miller wrote to the Ministry of Justice a few times and received no reply in over three years. The Greek Embassy in London denied that any court case was taking place in 2004 and in 2006, a court official in the Military Appellate Court in Athens told Necati that his assailant, Dandoulakis, was \\"really a good boy\\" and that Necati was not among witnesses being called to testify. Despite apparent bias, however, the guilty verdict was upheld. Nevertheless, the Greek Government has failed to apologise, accept responsibility for the actions of its armed and uniformed security personnel, issue a statement of non-recurrence or offer compensation. The Greek Ombudsman has written to and repeatedly discussed (in 2007) with the Greek Government, suggesting that an apology and a statement of sympathy would be in order. The Government has never responded. Further instances of torture and abuse by the Greek Coast Guard have been recorded, and some are recorded on YouTube. The Greek Government, in response to a request from the British Foreign Office in 2006-2007, issued a range of four conflicting dates for the cessation of national remedies. Together with his partner, Tim Wilson, Necati has campaigned against his assailants and has made a film of his experiences. It mixes animation and live action footage. The film, A Torture Cartoon, was sponsored by Screen South and the RIFE lottery project. The case came before the European Court of Human Rights. The treatment of foreign detainees and refugees in Greece has not greatly improved - to such an extent that the British Government has recently decided not to send refugees / asylum seekers who make their way to the UK back to Greece. In 2012, Necati's case was successful. The torture was admitted and modest compensation arranged. This was organised by the British charity REDRESS. Further violence to foreigners has continued in Greece, and has involved the detention and abuse of foreign tourists.

She was named after Mintaka, a star in the Orion constellation. Mintaka was crewed by United States Coast Guard personnel and was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. Construction Mintaka was laid down 9 February 1943, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 725, as Liberty ship SS Ansel Briggs by California Shipbuilding Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California; launched 10 March 1943; sponsored by Mrs. A. V. Bechtel; renamed Mintaka 17 March 1943; delivered to the Navy 26 March 1943; and commissioned at San Diego, California, 10 May 1943, Lieutenant Commander Lemuel S. Burgess, USCGR, in command. Service history =Cargo to New Zealand= Mintaka steamed to San Francisco late in the month and after loading cargo sailed for the South Pacific Ocean 15 June. Steaming via New Caledonia, she reached New Zealand 15 July, and discharged cargo at Auckland and Wellington before departing for the US West Coast 1 August. =Alaska cargo runs= She arrived San Francisco, California, 23 August, thence steamed 11 September, for Seattle to prepare for supply runs in Alaskan waters. Departing Puget Sound 24 September, she touched at Dutch Harbor 11 October, and during the next month she shuttled cargo to American bases in the Aleutians. =Conversion to troop transport= After returning to Seattle, Washington, 27 November, she underwent conversion to a troopcarrying cargo ship at Portland, Oregon, early in December. =Transporting troops to the war zone= Mintaka sailed 11 January 1944, for San Francisco whence, after embarking 1,056 troops, she sailed 2 February, for the South Pacific. She reached Noum√©a, New Caledonia, 23 February, and began troop and cargo shuttle runs among the islands of the South Pacific. Between 27 February and 10 March, she carried 1,800 troops to New Zealand and back: thence, she made a run to the New Hebrides before arriving Guadalcanal 9 April. During the next several months she maintained a busy schedule transporting fighting men and supplies to numerous American bases in Melanesia from the Admiralties to the Fijis. She carried thousands of troops to and from staging areas; on one run between the Green Islands and Guadalcanal in late May, she carried more than 1,500 soldiers. Mintaka departed Guadalcanal 26 September; operated out of Manus, Admiralties, during much of October; and sailed in convoy 26 October, for shuttle duty in the Palaus. Between 31 October and 30 November, she operated from Kossol Passage south to Peleliu discharging troops and cargo. After embarking 994 veterans of the Palaus' campaign, she returned to Guadalcanal 10 December, and resumed shuttle runs among the Solomons and the Bismarck Archipelago. With 968 Seabees embarked, she departed Guadalcanal 26 April 1945, bound for Okinawa. =Delivering troops to Okinawa= Steaming in convoy via Eniwetok and Ulithi, Mintaka reached Okinawa 21 May, and began debarking troops and unloading cargo. Despite periodic Japanese air attacks, she continued off-loading operations during the next week. On 25 May, her gunners splashed an enemy plane during an assault which damaged a nearby merchant ship. Mintaka sailed 31 May, touched at Ulithi 6 June, Pearl Harbor 23 June, and arrived San Francisco 3 July. =End-of-war operations= After voyage repairs, Mintaka embarked 1,035 troop reinforcements and departed Portland, Oregon, 24 July. The cessation of hostilities found her at Eniwetok. On 20 August, she reached Saipan, Marianas, and began debarking troops. Subsequent troop and cargo runs during the remainder of the year carried her to Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Ulithi.  Post-war decommissioning  She returned to San Francisco 30 December, decommissioned there 12 February 1946, and was redelivered to WSA the same day. Her name was struck the Navy List 26 February 1946. Mintaka was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay Group, Benecia, California, on 12 February 1946. On 6 March 1968, she was sold to Union Minerals & Alloys Corporation for scrapping. She was withdrawn from the fleet on 18 March 1968, and scrapping was completed on 20 November 1968.

Club career Tonga‚Äôuiha moved from Tonga to Auckland, New Zealand with his family at the age of eight. At first, in Auckland, he played rugby league. He played rugby union from the age of 15 when he went to St Peter's College, Auckland the same Catholic school attended by Pat Lam who also taught there. In his final year at school, in 2000, the team went through the season undefeated, winning the Auckland Championship and the New Zealand First XV Knock out competition. The team was inspired by Pat Lam.\\"The Saint who has date with destiny\\", The Independent (UK), 10 April 2011, pp. 1 and 17. (retrieved 3 May 2011) In 2001, Tonga‚Äôuiha joined the Ponsonby rugby club in Auckland.where he was selected for the Auckland Colts side, playing one game against Japan. Tonga‚Äôuiha was selected for the Auckland team in 2002 and 2003, playing 12 games and scoring one try. He first made his break at Bedford Blues as he shone in the 2005/06 season, helping Bedford to a second-place finish behind rugby giants Harlequins, and a Powergen Trophy final place. This, combined with his mobile aggressive ball-carrying, caused Northampton Saints to consider using him. He had also scored a try against Saints in Northampton's victory over Bedford Blues in the Powergen Cup game in December 2004. Tonga'uiha moved to Northampton Saints at the start of the 2006/07 season and at first ‚Äì being behind Scotland and British and Irish Lions legend Tom Smith- did not have too many starts in the Guinness Premiership. However, in the 2007/08 season, when Saints found themselves in National League 1, he excelled and earned a number of first team appearances as Northampton Saints cruised towards promotion at the end of the season. This upward trend in performances continued into the 2008/09 season when ‚Äì combined with Tom Smith's move towards coaching ‚Äì Tonga'uiha cemented his place in the match-day squad and has had his fair share of appearances in the starting XV. Tonga'uiha became something of a crowd favourite at Franklin's Gardens with the nickname 'Tiny' ‚Äì an ironic take on his size. On 27 January 2010, it was announced that Tonga'uiha would join Saracens at the start of the 2010/11 season. However, in April 2010, he changed his mind and signed a new three-year contract with the Saints. Soane Tonga'uiha left the Saints at the end of the season 2012-2013 to join the Top 14 Paris club Racing Metro. On 16 May 2014, Soane left Racing Metro to join Top 14 rivals Oyonnax from the 2014-15 season. On 30 June 2016, Tonga'uiha returned to England to join new Aviva Premiership side Bristol Rugby on a two-year deal, prior to the 2016-17 season. He was released by Bristol in April 2018. Shortly after Tonga'uiha took up a player/coach role at Ampthill RUFC. Ampthill were promoted to the Championship at the end of the 2018-19 season. https://www.ampthillrufc.com/tongan-international-soane- tongauiha-signs-for-2018-19/ In August 2020 it was confirmed that Tonga'uiha had signed for National League 1 side Chinnor as a player/coach. International career Tonga'uiha during 2011 World Cup =New Zealand= Tonga‚Äôuiha played for the New Zealand under 19 team in 2001, winning the World Cup. In 2003, he was selected for the New Zealand under 21 team and again won the applicable age grade World Cup. =Tonga= Tonga'uiha's international career began in 2004 with selection to the newly formed Pacific Islanders rugby union team, a composite team made up of the best players from Samoa, Fiji and Tonga. His career stalled after that as being a professional playing in Europe restricted him from summer tests for his native Tonga. His sights had been firmly set on the 2007 Rugby World Cup to be held in France ‚Äì ensuring his and other seasoned professionals playing Europe's participation. In 2007, he travelled to France as part of the Tongan national rugby team to take part in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, playing in all four games as Tonga upset the form book, beating the USA and arch rivals Samoa and pushing eventual winners South Africa and runners-up England all the way. By the end of the tournament, Tonga'uiha had seven caps for Tonga. Tonga'uiha was again part of his country's World Cup squad for the 2011 event, starting in three and featuring in all four of Tonga's matches, including the impressive 19-14 win in their final game over runners-up France. Personal life He often returns to Blues' home games at Goldington Road with his family; he is still a favourite figure at the club. Tonga'uiha married his wife Lucy in the summer of 2006.

The Nuclear power station Oskarshamn is one of three active nuclear power stations in Sweden. The plant is about north of Oskarshamn, directly at the Kalmarsund at the Baltic Sea coast and with one active reactor, producing about 10% of the electricity needs of Sweden. All reactors were built using BWR technology. Unit 1 had an installed output of 494 MW and Unit 2 664 MW; these are now decommissioned. Unit 3, the newest reactor block at the facility, has an installed output of 1,450 MW. Clab, the temporary storage facility for spent nuclear fuel from all Swedish reactors, is also located at the site. Operator The responsible utility is OKG, short for the Oskarshamnsverkets Kraftgrupp OKG, which was acquired by Sydkraft in 1993, (later: E.ON Sverige). Uniper owns 54.5% and the other partner Fortum 45.5% of OKG. History On July 25, 2006, Units 1 and 2 were shut down as a precaution after a safety-related incident at an identical reactor at the Forsmark plant. The incident related to a failure of diesel generators to automatically start up when required, after a blackout caused by a shortcut at the grindgear sections at the plant. Modifications were later made to all the plants to address the issue. On May 21, 2008, a welder was caught on the entrance security check with trace elements of explosives on a carrier bag and his hand. The same evening Reactor 1 of the facility was shut down to allow bomb teams to sweep the facility. With police investigations ongoing, Kalmar police spokesperson Sven-Erik Karlsson confirmed to the TT news agency that a welder on his way in to the plant on Wednesday morning was caught with a relatively small amount of a highly explosive substance. The substance was later shown to be from nail polish and the event had no relevance to the operation of the plant or nuclear safety. During 2010 Unit 2 underwent power and security upgrades. Unit 3 was after many upgrades the most powerful BWR in the world at approximately 1450 MWe. Due to the upgrade, the reactor had been on and off the grid with prolonged maintenance outages throughout 2010. Unit 2 will be upgraded in several steps and will reach maximum capacity of thermal power 2,300 MW and 840 MWe in 2011. On September 30, 2013, a portion of the plant (the third reactor) was closed when a group of jellyfish clogged the cooling water intake pipes. It was not indicated as to whether the event had been classified as a safety disturbance yet, and to what level on the scale used for nuclear plants. A decision on premature shutdown of units 1 and 2 was made in 2015. The decision entails that there will be no future investments at unit 2 and the reactor will not be restarted. Unit 1 was originally set for decommissioning on June 29, 2017, but it was closed prematurely due to an \\"operational disturbance\\" on June 17, 2017. It was decided not to restart the unit ahead of the shutdown scheduled for June 29, 2017. In December 2018 a strategy was outlined for the \\"radiological demolition\\" of units 1 and 2 to be carried out between 2020 and 2028. This will allow the land to be used for other nuclear power related purposes.

He became known as a fastball hitter who was used mostly against right-handed pitching, and played all three outfield positions well as a reserve. Midway through the season, he was traded to the Montreal Expos (1975‚Äì76). The following season, another midseason trade landed him with the New York Mets ().

Bath, The Holburne Museum.(Henrietta) Laura Pulteney, 1st Countess of Bath (26 December 1766 - 14 July 1808) was a British peeress and heiress. Early life Born Henrietta Laura Johnstone in Westminster, she was the only child of the wealthy William Johnstone, later Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet, and his wife, Frances Pulteney, daughter of Daniel Pulteney. They moved to Bath House on Piccadilly, where she was raised. On her mother's death in 1782, she inherited the Pulteney estates. Initially educated at home, Pulteney was educated at the convent of Montparnasse in Paris, completing it in 1783. There she was visited by her kinswoman, the Countess of Hopetoun, her friend Lady Belmore and the Countess of Dundonald, the latter of whom introduced her to Parisian society. As a young woman, Pulteney spent time at Sudborough in Northamptonshire (later endowing a school there as well as in Clewer, Berkshire) where her neighbour was Archibald Alison, to whom she agreed to be a godmother to his son, William. Peerage and marriage Although Pulteney's father never sought political office, he did procure a peerage for her and she was created Baroness of Bath, in the County of Somerset, in 1792, aged twenty- six. Despite her mother's family having previously held the earldom of Bath until its extinction in 1764, a marquessate of Bath had been created for the 3rd Viscount Weymouth in 1789. Some peers attempted to have her peerage cancelled due to the unprecedented use of the same place name in two separate peerages for separate people. This was rejected and she was further elevated as Countess of Bath, in the County of Somerset, in 1803, although it is a general rule that, wherever possible, peerage titles should not be duplicated. On 17 July 1794, she married her father's first cousin, Sir James Murray, 7th Baronet and he took the additional surname of Pulteney. Later years When Lady Bath's father died intestate in 1805, his personal estate was divided between her and his second wife. Lady Bath inherited two thirds and property in England and America. She died just over three years later in Brighton, possibly from consumption and was buried in the south cloister of Westminster Abbey. Her personal estate passed to her cousin, Elizabeth Evelyn Fawcett (daughter of Sir Richard Sutton, 1st Baronet and ex-wife of George Markham, Dean of York); she and her husband changed their name to Pulteney. Her landed estates passed to William Vane, 3rd Earl of Darlington. As she had no children, her titles became extinct. The town of Henrietta, New York, where her father invested in land, was named for her. Sources *Rowe, M. J. and McBryde, W.

It was formed in the 1960s and enjoyed success throughout most of the 1970s. The band members were Paulinho Boca de Cantor (vocals), Pepeu Gomes (electric guitar), Moraes Moreira (vocals and acoustic guitar), Baby Consuelo (vocals and percussion) and Luiz Galv√£o (lyrics). The group always counted on the collaboration of the band A Cor do Som, composed of Pepeu Gomes (guitar), Dadi (bass), Jorginho (cavaquinho, drums and percussion), Baixinho (drums and percussion) and Bolacha (percussion). Novos Baianos is considered one of the most important and revolutionary groups in Brazilian music. History Novos Baianos started in the 1960s, but they appeared in public for the first time in 1968 at the show \\"Desembarque dos bichos depois do dil√∫vio\\", presented in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. At the time, the group was composed of Moreira, Boca de Cantor, Consuelo and Galv√£o. In 1969, the group participated in V Festival de M√∫sica Popular Brasileira, playing the song 'De vera'. The origin of the name came up during a performance on the TV channel Rede Record. When the group was still nameless, the festival producer, Marcos Ant√¥nio Riso yelled (in Portuguese) \\"Bring up these new Bahians!\\", referring to the band's place of origin (\\"Novos Baianos\\" is Portuguese for \\"new Bahians\\"). This song was on the band's first album, √â ferro na boneca, recorded one year later. Initially their sound was a fusion of psychedelic rock with traditional folk sounds from Brazil. Originally, the group only played with Pepeu Gomes and Jorginho at their live shows. However, gradually, Gomes started to acquire an ever more important role in the group: after he married Consuelo, he became a fully fledged band member and song arranger along with Moreira. Novos Baianos, 1972. Their music began to gravitate more towards MPB, particularly due to Jo√£o Gilberto's influence, who frequently visited the group. Their second album Acabou Chorare contained the classics 'Brasil Pandeiro', 'Preta Pretinha', 'Mist√©rio do Planeta' and 'Besta √© tu'. It was recorded on the Som Livre label in 1972, and years later would be considered the best Brazilian music album by Rolling Stone magazine. It was around this period that the group incorporated A Cor do Som as an auxiliary band. Novos Baianos, 1972. In 1972, after recording Acabou Chorare, Novos Baianos moved to a community in Vargem Grande, Rio de Janeiro, in a garage where they lived, played and composed music, and played soccer. This was the reason for the name of their third album, Novos Baianos F.C., recorded on the label Continental in 1973. The group had a strong hippie image at this time. The band released records until their break- up in 1978. In 1974, they recorded the first album without Moreira, who decided to start his own solo career. As Moreira had previously composed songs with Galv√£o and arranged songs with Gomes for the band's previous albums, it was a great loss to the band. The members tried to continue and incorporated Gato F√©lix to the group. In 1976, Dadi left the group to start A Cor do Som. Novos Baianos substituted Didi, the brother of Pepeu Gomes, for the loss of Dadi. However, the group disbanded some years later due to members starting their solo careers. Despite the end of the band, Novos Baianos' members reunited many times to celebrate special events. In 1997, the composer of the group, Luiz Galv√£o, published the book Anos 70: Novos e Baianos for Editora 34. In the book he tells the history of the group and its importance to Brazilian music. After Galv√£o released the book, the group reunited to record a new album, named Infinito Circular, recorded live at Metropolitan, Rio de Janeiro. In 2007, Moreira also published a book about the group. It was written as a cordel text and was named A Hist√≥ria dos Novos Baianos e Outros Versos. In 2009, the band reunited without Moreira to celebrate 40 years of Novos Baianos and their revolutionary role in Brazilian music. They also plan to record an album with an unreleased song.

The siphonal canal is an anatomical feature of the shells of certain groups of sea snails within the clade Neogastropoda. Some sea marine gastropods have a soft tubular anterior extension of the mantle called a siphon through which water is drawn into the mantle cavity and over the gill and which serves as a chemoreceptor to locate food. In certain groups of carnivorous snails, where the siphon is particularly long, the structure of the shell has been modified in order to house and protect the soft structure of the siphon.

Also known as R3, it was the third nuclear reactor built in Sweden. Construction started in 1957 and ended in 1962, operations began in 1964 and continued until 1974. The station was built underground, used heavy water moderation and was fueled with natural uranium. The station primarily provided district heating (initially 60 MW then increased to 80 MW) for the Stockholm suburb Farsta, as well as a small amount of electricity, 12 MW. It is widely assumed that the underground reactors had military purposes, being able to produce plutonium.\\"Neutral Sweden Quietly Keeps Nuclear Option Open\\", The Washington Post, 25 November 1994. The cost of construction was estimated at SEK 50 million but the final cost was SEK 230 million. The companies Stockholms Elverk and Statens Vattenfallsverk were responsible for the building of the √Ögesta plant. Before it was finished, another larger reactor, the R4 nuclear reactor was built at Marviken. The R4 reactor was intended for both electricity and plutonium production but it was cancelled in 1970. The station operated reliably except for problems with fuel rods in 1968 and a flooding incident on 1 May 1969. 15 fuel assemblies failed in 1968, causing the reactor to be shut down for seven months. In 1969 errors in operating procedures caused a valve to fail leaking 400 cubic metres of cooling water. This overloaded the drainage system and caused short-circuits throughout the plant. The water short-circuited the Emergency Core Coolant System resulting in high pressure heavy water leaking out of the core and into the piping of the ECCS. The water caused one of the main busbars for one of the generators to short, shutting down a turbine. The short-circuits preventing flooding from being indicated on the control board. The Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate did not publicly release information about this failure until 1993. The √Ögesta reactor, with 10 MW, was much smaller than the later Swedish reactor types. The reactor was part of a project called \\"the Swedish line\\" (Svenska Linjen), an international initiative to use natural uranium (not enriched) for fuel in commercial power plants. The shutdown of the plant was mostly a result of low oil prices and poor economics. The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority approved demolition of the station in December 2019, with work expected to begin in 2020 and to be completed by 2025.

It was on the east bank of the Missouri River, near the mouth of Swan Creek.  History  LeBeau was the terminus of a branch line of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway (M&StL;) built westward in 1907 from Conde, South Dakota. For a time, LeBeau was a boom town, and a major cattle-shipping point for the large ranches on the opposite side of the Missouri. The M&StL; planned to continue building its line westward from LeBeau, and began initial work on a Missouri River bridge there. Those expansion plans never materialized, however, and LeBeau quickly went into decline after the competing Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad completed its own lines into the region west of the river. The M&StL; trackage to LeBeau was removed in 1924. In the summers of 1954 and 1955 the University of South Dakota fielded an archeological dig under the leadership of Dr. Wesley Hurt. They excavated a large earth lodge complex next to the old town of LeBeau. One of the student diggers, Tyler Bastian, spent weekends excavating in the cellar pits of LeBeau. Bastian went on to get his Ph.D. and become state archeologist for Maryland. LeBeau at that time was located on the ranch of Dean Boehmer.

He signed for Everton as a youngster but was released by the club. He returned to the professional game six years later with Watford, and went on to play for Charlton Athletic, Blackburn Rovers, Huddersfield Town, Workington and Hartlepool United. Youth career Born in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, Endean left school at the age of 15 with no plans to become a professional footballer, choosing instead to start an apprenticeship as a welder. He also played for a junior football team in Pelton Fell, where he was spotted by a scout from Football League First Division club Everton. The Liverpool-based club signed him to a youth contract, but after four days, unable to settle in the city, he asked to be released from his contract. He returned to his native North-East England, where he resumed work as a welder and played only local amateur football. Senior career By 1968, Endean was playing for a pub team, for whom he was a prolific goalscorer. In September of that year, he was spotted playing for an amateur team in a public park and was invited to sign for Watford of the Football League Third Division. He was soon a regular in the club's first team and, in January of the following year, he was part of the Watford team which held Manchester United, the reigning European Cup-holders, to a 1‚Äì1 draw in front of over 60,000 fans at Old Trafford in the third round of the 1968‚Äì69 FA Cup. He also scored the winning goal for the club against Liverpool in the sixth round of the 1969‚Äì70 FA Cup at Vicarage Road on 21 February 1970, covered by BBC Television's Match of the Day. In total he scored 28 goals for the \\"Hornets\\" in 77 Football League games, and helped the club gain promotion to the Second Division in the 1968‚Äì69 season. In February 1971, Endean was transferred to Charlton Athletic of the Second Division, where he spent eight months. He made 27 League appearances for the London-based club, but only scored one goal. He dropped back down to the Third Division when he joined Blackburn Rovers in October 1971. He had a more successful spell with the Ewood Park-based club, registering 18 League goals in 75 appearances. In March 1975 he moved to Huddersfield Town, but played only 12 times for the club, scoring a single goal. In late 1975 he was loaned out to Workington of the Fourth Division. In March of the following year he moved on to Hartlepool United, where he finished his professional career with a spell of 25 League games, during which he scored five goals.

Through the use of the sodium glucose cotransporter 1 protein, cells are able to obtain glucose which is further utilized to make and store energy for the cell.  Structure  The sodium glucose cotransporter 1 is classified as an integral protein that is made up of 14 alpha-helices constructed from the folding of 482-718 amino acid residues with both the N and C-terminal residing upon the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. It is hypothesized that the protein contains protein kinase A and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, which serve to regulate the proteins conformational shape through phosphorylation of amino acids with ATP.  Function  Glucose transporters are integral membrane proteins that mediate the transport of glucose and structurally related substances across cellular membranes. Two families of glucose transporter have been identified: the facilitated diffusion glucose transporter family (GLUT family), also known as uniporters, and the sodium-dependent glucose transporter family (SGLT family), also known as cotransporters or symporters. The SLC5A1 gene encodes the sodium glucose cotransporter protein that is involved in the facilitated transport of glucose and galactose into eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The role of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 is to absorb D-glucose and D-galactose from the brush-border membrane of the small intestines, while also exchanging sodium ions and glucose from the tubule of the nephron. The SGLT1 protein is able to uptake glucose through cellular membranes through coupling the energy generated from cotransporting 2 sodium ions with glucose through a symport mechanism. This protein does not use ATP as energy source.  Transport mechanism  The sodium glucose cotransporter is original arranged with an outward-facing conformation with open receptors in preparation for 2 sodium ions and glucose to simultaneously bind. Once bound, the protein receptor will change conformation to an occluded conformation, which prevents the dissociation of the sodium ions and glucose. The protein will then change conformations once more to an inward-facing conformation in which allows sodium and glucose will to dissociate. The protein then returns to the outward-facing conformation state, ready to bind more sodium ions and glucose.  Cloning  Co-transport proteins of mammalian cell membranes had eluded efforts of purification with classical biochemical methods until the late 1980s. These proteins had proven difficult to isolate because they contain hydrophilic and hydrophobic sequences and exist in membranes only in very low abundance (<0.2% of membrane proteins). The rabbit form of SGLT1 was the first mammalian co-transport protein ever to be cloned and sequenced, and this was reported in 1987. To circumvent the difficulties with traditional isolation methods, a novel expression cloning technique was used. Size-fractionation of large amounts of rabbit intestinal mRNA with preparative gel electrophoresis were then sequentially injected into Xenopus oocytes to ultimately find the RNA species that induced the expression of sodium-glucose cotransport.  Mutations  SLC5A1 is medically relevant because of its role in the absorption of glucose and sodium, however, mutations in the gene can cause medical implications. A missense mutation in the SLC5A1 gene of exon 1 can cause problems creating the SGLT1 protein, leading to a rare glucose-galactose malabsorption disease. This is because the mutation destroys the transport function. Glucose-galactose malabsorption occurs when the lining of the intestinal cells cannot take in glucose and galactose which prevents the use of those molecules in catabolism and anabolism. The disease has symptoms that consist of watery and/or acidic diarrhea which is the result of water retention in the intestinal lumen and osmotic loss created by non-absorbed glucose, galactose and sodium. Glucose-Galactose malabsorption can cause death due to loss of water from diarrhea if the disease is not treated. To counteract the disease and the effects of acute diarrhea and dehydration, the sodium glucose cotransporter 1 protein is targeted for its mechanistic benefits with ion transfers by oral rehydration therapy through increasing sodium, glucose, and water concentrations for intestinal reabsorption.  Tissue distribution  The SLC5A1 cotransporter is mainly expressed in the lumen of the small intestine, kidney, parotid glands, submandibular glands and in the heart.

Meanwhile, their values continue to make this group an important bellwether of the middle-class mood in America.

The book shows us how this subset of America, labeled the Middle-Class Millionaire, manages to thrive with one foot in the world they came from (the middle-class) and one foot in the world they now inhabit (the wealthy). The Middle-Class Millionaire is based on extensive personal interviews with more than 3,500 American households in 2006. It provides a three-dimensional portrait of a previously unrecognized demographic group: the emerging affluent middle class.  Key concepts  Millionaire‚Äôs Intelligence: There are four behaviors that middle-class millionaires exhibit that appear to be linked to their success. These qualities have origins in classic middle-class values but they have applied them in uncommon ways. The Influence of Affluence: Because the middle-class millionaire is both willing and able to try new things (products, services, places and ways to live, etc.) they are an important indicator for how the world might be changing in the years to come.

The issue is further compounded by the large number of autonomous Independent Baptist churches which are not part of an organization and have their own doctrinal statements and beliefs. Basic beliefs As with most issues, there is a diversity of views of members of Baptist churches on homosexuality. Some denominations remain more conservative, believing in what they describe as 'traditional' marriage between one man and one woman. Other more liberal denominations allow local and autonomous congregations to determine their own regional policies. Thus, denominations are generally divided on the issue and reflect a diversity of opinions. Nevertheless, Baptists generally believe that homosexuality must be an issue that is approached with compassion and love. Dr. Albert Mohler, President of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, emphasizes that: \\"Our response to persons involved in homosexuality must be marked by genuine compassion. But a central task of genuine compassion is telling the truth, and the Bible reveals a true message we must convey. Those seeking to contort and subvert the Bible‚Äôs message are not responding to homosexuals with compassion. To lie is never compassionate ‚Äî and their lie leads unto death.\\" A relatively small, albeit growing, number of Baptists and congregations are open to the acceptance of homosexual relationships.Network of Baptists affirming Lesbian & Gay Christians This openness may, however, be based on sustaining a beneficial relationship than a change in the teachings of the Holy Bible.

A subsequent position statement in 2014 prohibited the convention's chaplains from officiating same-sex marriages or civil unions stating that they \\"are not to participate in any activity that implies or condones same sex marriage or same sex union.\\"SAME SEX MARRIAGE AND RELATED ACTIVITIES National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. January 27, 2014. In 2006 the organization stated that a majority of their member churches would hold that homosexuality is not a legitimate expression of God's will and would be opposed to ordaining active homosexuals or lesbians for any type of ministry in their church.FAQ on nationalbaptist.com * The Australian Baptist Ministries supports the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, and rejects moves to extend the definition to include same sex relationships. * Independent Fundamental Baptist churches, while not an official denomination, largely are opposed to homosexuality in all of its forms and believe marriage is strictly between a man and a woman. =Neutral position= * The American Baptist Churches USA, a mainline US Baptist denomination of around 1.1 million members released a statement following the legalization of same-sex marriage by the Supreme Court of the United States saying that the denomination will \\"respect and will continue to respect congregational freedom on this issue.\\" While the General Board had previously voted to define marriage as \\"between one man and one woman,\\" the denomination did not adopt the policy statement. The ABCUSA \\"allows individual congregations to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy or perform same-sex marriages\\" and does not have a denomination-wide policy. * The Progressive National Baptist Convention, a mainline predominantly African American denomination, does not have an official position and, like many Baptist denominations, allows individual congregations to determine their own view. As a result, some congregations have performed blessings and marriages for same- sex couples. * The Baptist Union of Great Britain with 140,000 individuals holds a nuanced view. It says that same sex couples \\"should not suffer discrimination because of their sexual orientation\\", while affirming that Christians who believe that same sex relationships are wrong should not be forced to compromise on what they believe as a tenet of their faith.Issues raised by the Equality Act (sexual orientation on baptist.org.uk * The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a relatively small American-based network of Baptist churches, does not have an official policy on homosexuality (or other social issues). It allows individual organizations and churches to support or fund gay rights advocacy if they so choose, but it is not required or prohibited. =Liberal position= * The Network of Baptists affirming Lesbian & Gay Christians is a small UK network of Baptists who seek to support lesbians and gay men and people concerned about their sexuality in the church. * The Alliance of Baptists is a small theologically progressive, American Baptist denomination which supports same-sex marriage and is open to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender believers. Statement on Same Sex Marriage April 17, 2004 on allianceofbaptists.org * The Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists is made up of Baptist churches, organizations, and individuals who welcome and affirm people regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, and advocate for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender inclusion within Baptist faith communities.The Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists This group is made up of almost 100 churches and organizations among the American Baptist Churches in the USA and the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. * The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., American Baptist Churches USA, and Progressive National Baptist Convention also have congregations and ministers who take a liberal position on the issue.

The station broadcasts news and information, as well as country music 24 hours a day. KEYZ has a 5,000-watt signal that covers more than 20 counties and portions of two Canadian provinces. Additionally, it is heard in the immediate Williston area on FM translator K277DR, at 103.3 FM. The station also has two sister stations, KTHC and KYYZ. All three stations are owned by Cherry Creek Radio of Denver, Colorado, and are located at 410 6th Street East, on Williston's east side. History KWBM signed on in 1948 at 1450 kHz. The new station was owned by the Williston Broadcasting Company and was Williston's first licensed radio station, though KGCX of nearby Sidney, Montana, had opened a Williston studio in 1946. Its finances prevented the station from being an immediate success. On June 30, 1950, KWBM went silent, shortly followed by a bankruptcy petition. In February 1951, the Federal Communications Commission authorized its sale to Charles L. Scofield and James Caravaras for $100 and the assumption of more than $8,000 in station liabilities. Jack McGeehan, who later went on to be a state representative from Williams County in 1971, was an on-air personality at KWBM. Scofield would also serve in the state legislature. KWBM became KEYZ in 1955. The station established a second studio in Crosby, away, and it bought an aircraft to help it serve clients in its 100-mile trading radius. It was the only station in North Dakota to maintain its own aircraft. By 1960, the station was on its third plane: a Beechcraft Bonanza. In addition to sales calls, KEYZ's plane was put to use for news coverage, farm programming, promotional events, executive travel, and even search and rescue efforts. In 1957, KEYZ was approved to move to 1360 kHz, permitting a power boost from 250 to 5,000 watts. The company grew with the establishment of the Community Service Television cable system in 1967, and in 1979, the signing on of FM outlet KYYZ. In 1985, after a five-year hearing, Basin Broadcasters, owned by former KGCX general manager Duane Simpson, obtained the construction permit for a new station at 660 kHz in Williston, beating out KEYZ on diversification and integration criteria. Basin had also put on air the first commercial competitor to KEYZ-KYYZ, KDSR, which began operations on February 28, 1985. The permit was granted despite a petition to deny by the clear channel station on 660 being broken down: WNBC in New York, which claimed the new facility would cause objectionable skywave interference. The construction permit took the KQSR call letters. In 1987 Basin sold the construction permit to Scofield for nearly $72,000. In March 1991, KEYZ's intellectual unit moved to the new 660 facility, while 1360 was taken silent and its license surrendered. STARadio acquired Scofield's broadcasting holdings in 1996. In 2000, it sold its Williston-Sidney cluster and four additional Montana stations for $7.3 million to Commonwealth Communications. (This may be from the July 31, 2000 RBR) The Williston-Sidney cluster was sold to present owners Cherry Creek in 2003 as part of a $41 million, 24-station transaction. In 2018, KEYZ was granted an AM revitalization translator, giving it a 250-watt FM signal at 103.3 MHz.

The stated purpose of the Tallahassee Museum is \\"to educate the residents of and visitors to the Big Bend area about the region's natural and cultural history, from the nineteenth century until the present.\\" \\"Big Bend\\" refers to that portion of Florida where the Florida panhandle meets the peninsular portion of the state. Tallahassee, Florida's capital city, is centrally located in that region.  History  Discussions in 1957 led to the formation of the \\"Tallahassee Junior Museum,\\" a name which was eventually changed to \\"Tallahassee Museum,\\" although the earlier name is still occasionally used. The museum was moved to its current 52-acre (210,000 m2) location in 1962, lodged between Lakes Bradford and Hiawatha, in Leon County, Florida.  Facilities and exhibits  A major strength of the museum lies in the diversity of its exhibits and the multiple utilization capabilities of its facilities. =Big Bend Farm= A considerable portion of the grounds is devoted to the re-creation of rural life in north Florida in about 1880. Included in that effort are homes, gardens, farm buildings (with appropriate farm animals), a gristmill, and a turpentine commissary. Reconstructed farm houses from 1880, August 2007 A boardwalk over cypress habitat, August 2007. Bellevue Plantation, once the home of Catherine Murat, August 2007 =Wildlife Florida= Another major portion of the museum is devoted to Florida wildlife, with many animals in relatively large, well-vegetated areas, usually similar to native habitats. Of note are black bears, white-tailed deer, and bobcats, as well as several endangered species: red wolves and Florida panthers. There are also several aviaries, a snake exhibit, small mammals, and a \\"guest\\" animal habitat, which was introduced in 1988. Twice a day, there are \\"Animal Encounters,\\" during which a staff member shows and teaches about an animal. They may show birds of prey, snakes, a rabbit, or a skunk. Many of the animals used for education have been injured, especially birds of prey. Since these animals could not survive in the wild, in accordance with state laws, they must either be used for education or be put down. =Old Florida= Buildings of historical interest or importance comprise the Old Florida segment of the museum: the 19th century Bellevue Plantation (once the home of Catherine Murat, a relative of George Washington, and wife of Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew Achille Murat), the 1937 Bethlehem Missionary Baptist Church (founded by Rev. James Page, a slave preacher), the 1890s Concord schoolhouse, a reminder of early African-American educational facilities, and a 1920s caboose. =Florida & Beyond= This section includes the Fleischmann Natural Science Building with two freshwater aquaria and facilities for bird watching, the Phipps Gallery with changing exhibits of local art, culture and history, and the Discovery Center, a family interactive area with hands-on exhibits about the natural history and culture of North Florida. =Other= The museum also has several nature trails, one of which includes a boardwalk over normally flooded cypress habitat, and a number of special-use facilities for indoor exhibits and workspaces.

Overview The most common story involves a traveler who encounters a corpse of someone who never received a proper burial, typically stemming from an unpaid debt. The traveler then either pays off the dead person's debt or pays for burial. The traveler is later rewarded or has their life saved by a person or animal who is actually the soul of the dead person; the grateful dead is a form of the donor. The grateful dead spirit may take many different physical forms including that of a guardian angel, animal, or fellow traveler. The traveler's encounter with the deceased comes near the end of the traveler's journey. Classification The \\"grateful dead\\" story is Aarne‚ÄìThompson‚ÄìUther type 505.

In French academia, the archetype of the Gratetul Dead is known as Jean de Calais. Variants In many cultures there is the belief that when a person dies their soul is separated from their body thus giving someone a proper burial allows their spirit to carry on into the next life. An ancient Egyptian text explains the principle of reciprocity in which the deceased calls for a blessing on the person who remembers his name and helps him into a happy afterlife: > But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing and > causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who are > blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving (at the > end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for me, > Osiris.\\"The Burden of Isis, Being the Laments of Isis and Nephthys\\", James > Teackle Dennis, Dutton & Co, 1910 One variant of the motif is the Book of Tobit.Laura A.

Route description Located entirely in Grand County's Thompson Springs, SR-94 begins at a diamond interchange with exit 187 of I-70 and heads north as a two-lane undivided highway. The road turns to the northeast after passing a Shell gas station, intersecting a local road, and then the highway forms the western border of a Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) maintenance facility. After the maintenance facility the route turns north again and passes a mobile home court and comes to an end at an intersection with Old Cisco Highway. Across Old Cisco Highway is the former Thompson railroad depot of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. Every year, UDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, UDOT calculated that 740 vehicles traveled along the highway, with 51 percent of the traffic consisted of trucks. UDOT has classified the roadway as a minor collector route. History The former Thompson railroad depot at the end of SR-94 State Route 94 was formed in 1969 as a connector from I-70 to Thompson Springs.

The Rashidun army maintained a high level of discipline, strategic prowess and organization.Britain and the Arabs: Contributors: JB Glubb - author. Publisher: Hodder and Staughton. Place of Publication: London. Publication Year: 1959. Page Number:34 In its time, the Rashidun army was a powerful and very effective force. The three most successful generals of the Rashidun army were Khalid ibn al-Walid, who conquered Persian Mesopotamia and Roman Syria, and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah who conquered Roman Syria, and 'Amr ibn al-'As, who conquered Roman Egypt. Army Only Muslims were allowed to join the Rashidun army as regular soldiers. During the Ridda wars in the reign of Caliph Abu Bakr, the army mainly consisted of the corps from Medina, Mecca and Taif. Later on during the conquest of Iraq in 633 many bedouin corps were recruited as regular soldiers. During the Islamic conquest of Sassanid Persia (633-656), some 12,000 elite Persian soldiers converted to Islam and served later on during the invasion of the empire. During the Muslim conquest of Roman Syria (633-638,) some 4,000 Greek Byzantine soldiers under their commander Joachim (later Abdullah Joachim) converted to Islam and served as regular troops in the conquest of both Anatolia and Egypt. During the conquest of Egypt (641-644), Coptic converts to Islam were recruited. During the conquest of North Africa, Berber converts to Islam were recruited as regular troops, who later made the bulk of the Rashidun army and later the Umayyad army in Africa. =Infantry= Rashidun army relied heavily on their infantry. The infantry, rather than cavalry, was the bulk of the army and its most important component. Mubarizun were a special part of the Muslim army, composed of the champions. Their role was to undermine the enemy morale by slaying their champions. The infantry would make repeated charges and withdrawals known as karr wa farr, using spears and swords combined with arrow volleys to weaken the enemies and wear them out. However, the main energy had to still be conserved for a counterattack, supported by a cavalry charge, that would make flanking or encircling movements. Defensively, the Muslim spearman with their two and a half meter long spears would close ranks, forming a protective wall (Tabi'a) for archers to continue their fire. This close formation stood its ground remarkably well in the first four days of defence in the Battle of Yarmouk.Military History Online =Cavalry= The Rashidun cavalry was one of the most successful light cavalry forces, provided it was competently led. It was armed with lances and swords. Initially, the cavalry was used as a reserve force, with its main role being to attack the enemy once they were weakened by the repeated charges of the infantry. The cavalry would then make flanking or encircling movements against the enemy army, either from the flanks or straight from the center, most likely using a wedge-shaped formation in its attack. Some of the best examples of the use of the cavalry force occurred under the command of Khalid ibn Walid in the Battle of Walaja against the Sassanid Persians and in the Battle of Yarmouk against the Byzantines. In both cases the cavalry regiments were initially stationed behind the flanks and center. The proportion of cavalry within the Rashidun forces were initially limited to less than 20% due to the inability of the poor economic condition and arid climate of the Arabian Peninsula to support large numbers of warhorses. As the wealthy lands of the Near East were conquered, many Arab warriors acquired horses as booty or tribute, so that by the end of the Rashidun period half of the \\"Jund\\" forces were composed of cavalry. Mounted archery was initially not used by the Rashidun cavalry unlike their Byzantine and Persian opponents, this not being a traditional Arab fighting method. As the conquest of Persia progressed, some Sassanid gentry converted into Islam and joined the Rashidun cause; these \\"Asawira\\" were very highly regarded due to their skill as heavy cavalrymen as well as mounted archers. Weaponry A Rashidun elite soldier equipped for infantry warfare. He is wearing an iron-bronze helmet, a chain mail hauberk, and leather lamellar armor. His sword is hung from a baldric, and he carries a leather shield. Reconstructing the military equipment of early Muslim armies is problematic. Compared with Roman armies‚Äîor, indeed, later medieval Muslim armies‚Äîthe range of visual representation is very small, often imprecise and difficult to date. Physically very little material evidence has survived and again, much of it is difficult to date.The Armies of the Caliphs: Military and Society in the Early Islamic State.

Page Number:168 =Helmets= Muslim headgear included gilded helmets‚Äîboth pointed and rounded‚Äîsimilar to that of the silver helmets of the Sassanid Empire. The rounded helmet, referred to as ‚Äò‚ÄôBaidah‚Äô‚Äô (\\"Egg\\"), was a standard early Byzantine type composed of two pieces. The pointed helmet was a segmented Central Asian type known as ‚Äò‚ÄôTarikah‚Äô‚Äô. Mail armour was commonly used to protect the face and neck, either as an aventail from the helmet or as a mail coif the way it had been used by Romano-Byzantine armies since 5th century. The face was often half covered with the tail of a turban that also served as protection against the strong desert winds. =Armour= Hardened leather scale or lamellar armour was produced in Yemen, Iraq and along the Persian gulf coast. Mail armour was preferred and became more common later during the conquest of neighbouring empires, often being captured as part of the booty. It was known as Dir, and was opened part-way down the chest. To avoid rusting it was polished and stored in a mixture of dust and oil.Yarmouk 636, Conquest of Syria by David Nicolle Infantry soldiers were more heavily armoured than horsemen. =Shields= Large wooden or wickerwork shields were in use, but most shields were made of leather. For this purpose, the hides of camels and cows was used and it would be anointed, a practice since ancient Hebrew times.title During the invasion of the Levant, Byzantine soldiers extensively used elephant hide shields, which were probably captured and used by the Rashidun army. =Spears= Long spears were locally made with the reeds of the Persian gulf coast. The reeds were similar to that of bamboo. =Swords= The sword was the most prestigious weapon of the early Muslims. High quality swords were made in Yemen from Indian wootz steel.,Augus Mcbride while inferior swords were made throughout Arabia. Both the short Arab swords (similar to the Roman gladius) and Sassanid long swords were used and Rashidun horsemen as well as foot soldiers were often described as carrying both at the same time. All swords hung from a baldric. Another personal weapon was the dagger, a weapon used only as a last resort. =Bows= Bows were locally made in various parts of Arabia; the most typical were the hijazi bows. It could be one piece of wood or two pieces joined together back to back. The maximum useful range of the traditional Arabian bow used to be about 150 meters. Early Muslim archers were infantry archers. =Siege weaponry= Catapults were used extensively in siege operations. Under Caliph Umar siege towers, called dababah were also employed. These wooden towers moved on wheels and were several stories tall. They were driven up to the foot of the besieged fortification and then the walls were pierced with a battering ram. Archers guarded the ram and the soldiers who moved it. Organization of army as a state department Caliph Umar was the first Muslim ruler to organize the army as a state department. This reform was introduced in 637 AD A beginning was made with the Quraish and the Ansars and the system was gradually extended to the whole of Arabia and to Muslims of conquered lands. A register of all adults who could be called to war was prepared, and a scale of salaries was fixed. All registered men were liable for military service. They were divided into two categories, namely: # Those who formed the regular standing army; and #Those that lived in their homes, but were liable to be called to the colors whenever needed. The pay was given in the beginning of the month of Muharram. The allowances were paid during the harvesting season. The armies of the Caliphs were mostly paid in cash salaries. In contrast to many post-Roman polities in Europe, grants of land, or rights to collect taxes directly from the people within one's grant of land, were of only minor importance. A major consequence of this was that the army directly depended on the state for its subsistence which, in turn, meant that the military had to control the state apparatus.The Armies of the Caliphs: Military and Society in the Early Islamic State. Contributors: Hugh Kennedy - author. Publisher: Routledge. Place of Publication: London. Publication Year: 2001. Page Number:59 Movement When the army was on the march, it always halted on Fridays. When on march, the day's march was never allowed to be so long as to tire out the troops. The stages were selected with reference to the availability of water and other provisions. The advance was led by an advance guard consisting of a regiment or more. Then came the main body of the army, and this was followed by the women and children and the baggage loaded on camels. At the end of the column moved the rear guard. On long marches the horses were led; but if there was any danger of enemy interference on the march, the horses were mounted, and the cavalry thus formed would act either as the advance guard or the rearguard or move wide on a flank, depending on the direction from which the greatest danger loomed. When on march the army was divided into: *Muqaddima (ŸÖŸÇÿØŸÖÿ©) - \\"the vanguard\\" *Qalb (ŸÇŸÑÿ®) - \\"the center\\" *Al-khalf (ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÑŸÅ) - \\"the rear\\" *Al- mu'akhira (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ§ÿÆÿ±ÿ©) - \\"the rearguard\\" Divisions in battle The army was organized on the decimal system.Tabari: Vol. 3, p. 8 On the battlefield the army was divided into sections. These sections were: *Qalb (ŸÇŸÑÿ®) - \\"the center\\" *Maymana (ŸÖŸäŸÖŸÜŸá) - \\"the right wing\\" *Maysara (ŸÖŸäÿ≥ÿ±ÿ©) - \\"the left wing\\" Each section was under a commander and was at a distance of about 150 meters from each other. Every tribal unit had its leader called arifs. In such units, there were commanders for each 10, 100 and 1,000 men, the latter-most corresponding to regiments. The grouping of regiments to form larger forces was flexible, varying with the situation. Arifs were grouped and each group was under a commander called amir al-ashar and amir al-ashars were under the command of a section commander, who were under the command of the commander in chief, amir al-jaysh. Other components of the army were: *Rijal (ÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÑ) - \\"infantry\\" *Fursan (ŸÅÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÜ) - \\"cavalry\\" *Rumat (ÿ±ŸÖÿßÿ©) - \\"archers\\" *Tali'ah (ÿ∑ŸÑŸäÿπÿ©) - \\"patrols\\", who kept watch over enemy movements # 'Rukban (ÿ±ŸÉÿ®ÿßŸÜ) - \\"camel corps\\" # 'Nuhhab al-mu'an (ŸÜŸáŸëÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ§ŸÜ) - \\"foraging parties\\" Intelligence and espionage It was one of the most highly developed departments of the army which proved helpful in most of the campaigns. The espionage (ÿ¨ÿßÿ≥Ÿàÿ≥Ÿäÿ©) and intelligence services were first organised by Muslim general Khalid ibn Walid during his campaign to Iraq.Ibn Kathir, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, Dar Abi Hayyan, Cairo, 1st ed. 1416/1996, Vol. 6 P. 425. Later, when he was transferred to the Syrian front he organized the espionage department there as well.al-Waqdi Fatuh-al-sham page 61 Strategy The basic strategy of early Muslim armies setting out to conquer foreign land was to exploit every possible drawback of the enemy army in order to achieve victory with minimum losses as the Rashidun army, quality-wise and strength-wise, was sub-standard to the Sassanid Persian army and the Byzantine army. Khalid ibn Walid, the first Muslim general of the Rashidun Caliphate to conduct a conquest in foreign land, during his campaign against the Sassanid Persian Empire (Iraq 633 - 634) and Byzantine Empire (Syria 634 - 638) developed brilliant tactics that he used effectively against both the Sassanid army and the Byzantine army. The main drawback of the armies of Sassanid Persian Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire was their lack of mobility.A. I. Akram (1970). The Sword of Allah: Khalid bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns. National Publishing House, Rawalpindi. . Khalid ibn Walid decided to use the mobility of his own army to exploit the lack thereof in the Sassanid army and Byzantine army. Later the same strategy was adopted by all other Muslim generals throughout the period of military expansion. Though only part of the Rashidun army was actual cavalry, the entire army was camel mounted for movement. Khalid ibn Walid and then later Muslim generals were also able to make use of the fine fighting quality of the Muslim soldiers, the bulk of whom were bedouins and adept in swordsmanship. The Muslims' light cavalry during the later years of the Islamic conquest of Levant became the most powerful section of the army. The best use of this lightly armed and fast moving cavalry was revealed at the Battle of Yarmouk (636 A.D) in which Khalid ibn Walid, knowing the importance and ability of his cavalry, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage and disengage and turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign in Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name Tulai'a Mutaharrika (ÿ∑ŸÑŸäÿπÿ© ŸÖÿ™ÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉÿ©), or the mobile guard. This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that gave it an upper hand when maneuvering against any Byzantine army. With this mobile striking force, the conquest of Syria was made easy.Annals of the Early Caliphate By William Muir Another remarkable strategy developed by Al-Muthanna and later followed by other Muslim generals was not moving far from the desert so long as there were opposing forces within striking distance of its rear. The idea was to fight the battles close to the desert, with safe escape routes open in case of defeat.Tabari: Vol: 2, page no: 560. The desert was not only a haven of security into which the Sassanid army and Byzantine army would not venture, but also a region of free, fast movement in which their camel mounted troops could move easily and rapidly to any destination that they chose. Following this same strategy during the conquest of Iraq and Syria, Khalid ibn Walid did not engage his army deep into Iraq and Syria until the opposing army had lost its ability to threaten his routes to the desert. Another possible advantage of always keeping a desert at the rear was easy communication and reinforcement. Once the Byzantines were weakened and the Sassanids effectively destroyed, the later Rashidun generals were free to use any strategy and tactics to overpower the opposing forces but they mainly relied on the mobility of their troops to prevent the concentration of enemy troops in large numbers. Conduct and ethics The basic principle in the Qur'an for fighting is that other communities should be treated as one's own. Fighting is justified for legitimate self-defense, to aid other Muslims and after a violation of the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist.Patricia Crone, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, War article, p.456.

One of the victories of the mobile guard was at Battle of Hazir in 637 CE under the command of Khalid, in which not a single Byzantine soldier survived.Tabari: Vol. 3, p. 98. With this mobile striking force the Muslims easily conquered Syria with few casualties, including the Muslim victory at Battle of Iron Bridge which followed the surrender of Antioch. Khalid ibn Walid had organized a military staff ‚Äì a simple beginning of what later in military history would emerge as the general staff. He had collected from all the regions in which he had fought - Arabia, Iraq, Syria and Palestine - a small group of keen and intelligent men who acted as his 'staff officers', mainly functioning as an intelligence staff.Waqidi: Vol. 2, p. 47. They would collect information, organize the dispatch and questioning of agents, and keep Khalid up-to-date with the latest military situation. This was a personal staff rather than the staff of an army headquarters; wherever Khalid went, this staff went with him, and was part of the mobile guard. The Mobile guard remained under the personal command of Khalid ibn Walid for about four years (634-638 CE) until Khalid was dismissed from army by Caliph Umar after the completion of the conquest of the Levant. With the dismissal of Khalid this powerful cavalry regiment was dismantled. One of its brilliant commanders Qa'qa' ibn 'Amr al-Tamimi had been sent to the Persian front in 637 CE along with reinforcements for the Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah, in which he played an important part. A part of it was later sent to the Persian front as reinforcements for the Muslim conquest of Persia. Many of its members died in the plague during 639-640 CE which killed approximately 25,000 Muslims in Syria. This included many sub-commanders of the mobile guard like Zirrar ibn Azwar, those who survived accompanied the army under the command of Amr ibn al-'As to conquer Egypt.

The original highway, completed in November 1971, runs northeasterly from the state capital of Indianapolis, to the city of Fort Wayne, and then proceeds north to the state of Michigan (reaching its capital city, Lansing and beyond). This original section is also known as Segment of Independent Utility (SIU) 1 in the national plan for expansion of I-69. At present, the segment in Southwest Indiana temporarily begins at the interchange with U.S. Highway 41 (US 41) and Veterans Memorial Parkway in Evansville and temporarily ends just south of State Road 39 (SR 39) near Martinsville. Between I-64 and Bloomington four new terrain sections have opened in phases in 2009, 2012, and 2015 as part of the planned national extension of I-69 southwest from Indianapolis via Paducah, Memphis, Shreveport, and Houston to the international border with Mexico in Texas. The portion of I-69 between US 41 and I-64 is also known as the Robert D. Orr Highway and originally was designated I-164. Route description Interstate 69 in Indiana north of the US 35 interchange The northern stretch of I-69 in Indiana begins with an interchange at the northeast corner of I-465, the Indianapolis outer beltway, where Binford Boulevard, a four-lane divided surface arterial that formerly carried SR 37, transitions into the I-69 freeway. Southbound at this junction, most I-69 motorists take exit 200, which was formerly known as exit 0, to remain on a freeway and reach either I-465 south (with SR 37 south and the likely routing of future extended I-69) or I-465 west. Running in a northeasterly direction and concurrent with SR 37, I-69 turns east-northeast at the end of that overlap just past mile marker 205 (formerly marker 5) in Fishers. From there, the freeway turns more easterly through the Campus Parkway/Southeastern Parkway (former Greenfield Avenue and SR 238) interchange and remains on that general heading until it reaches the Pendleton area. After bypassing Pendleton to the west and north, SR 9 and SR 67 join I-69, which continues to the east-northeast into the Anderson area. There, SR 9 departs, and shortly thereafter I-69 begins two long curves to the northeast, and then the north. Between Daleville and Chesterfield, SR 67 departs I-69, bound for Muncie. From the Anderson‚ÄìMuncie region, I-69 continues north, running concurrently with US 35 between SR 28 east of Alexandria and SR 22 near Gas City. After passing SR 18 east of Marion, I-69 then heads more northeast, straight toward the Fort Wayne metro area. At the south junction of I-469, located at Lafayette Center Road near the General Motors truck assembly plant, US 33 joins I-69. US 24 used to be cosigned with I-69 from this point to the interchange at Jefferson Boulevard (originally known as Upper Huntington Road), even though it took travelers on that route several miles out of their way. However, in the mid-2010s, INDOT rerouted and resigned US 24 from its junction with I-469 in New Haven to use the northern leg of that beltway (concurrent with westbound US 30) to I-69, then south on the parent Interstate route to the aforementioned Jefferson Boulevard interchange. Now, eastbound US 24 joins northbound I-69 and US 33 there. US 33 continues on north to the Goshen Road interchange near Coliseum Boulevard on the northwest side of Fort Wayne, where it departs I-69, eastbound US 30 joins, and the freeway curves more to the east once again. The next junction is the US 27/SR 3 interchange at Lima Road on the north side of Fort Wayne. From the mid-1960s to 2001, US 27 was rerouted onto a concurrency with I-69 from here north to the Michigan border, but the route was thereafter truncated to this point as its national northern terminus. Past the next interchange at Coldwater Road, which was the original routing of US 27 north of town, the I-69 freeway curves back to a northerly heading. At the north junction of I-469, both US 30 and the present routing of US 24 now depart to the east along that beltway and shortly thereafter I-69 leaves the Fort Wayne metro area. I-69 then continues north, passing just to the west of Auburn, Waterloo, and Angola, before reaching the I-80/90 Indiana East‚ÄìWest Toll Road near Fremont. Very shortly thereafter, the route crosses into the state of Michigan at a point just northwest of Fremont. The southern stretch begins at an interchange with U.S. 41, briefly heading east then gradually curving to the north, bypassing downtown Evansville. Continuing through greater Bloomington, I-69 temporarily ends at a concurrency with S.R. 37 just south of S.R. 39. The portion of I-69 between Indianapolis and the Toll Road was first proposed in the seminal report Interregional Highways, released in January 1944. By March 1946, it was formally made part of the new National System of Interstate Highways by the U.S. Public Roads Administration. In 1958, its first extension was approved. This took the route into Michigan in order to connect with I-94 near Marshall. It was extended yet again, north to Lansing in the 1960s, and then east‚Äîfirst to Flint and finally to the border with Canada at Port Huron, Michigan‚Äîin the 1980s. The extreme southern portion of I-69 from I-465 to central Indianapolis was never built, though unpaved ghost ramps and overpasses for its connection to I-65 and I-70 can still be seen at the North Split/Spaghetti Bowl interchange just northeast of downtown Indy. =Configuration= Previously, all of I-69 in Indiana north of the Indianapolis metro area was four lanes, but INDOT has reconstructed and widened I-69 to six lanes through most of the Fort Wayne metro area by adding a travel lane in the median for each direction. Likewise, INDOT has widened I-69 from I-465 on the northeast side of Indianapolis to 116th Street/SR 37 in Fishers from the original six to eight through lanes, with additional auxiliary lanes between interchanges. A project to add a third travel lane in the median for each direction between 116th Street/SR 37 and SR 38 near Pendleton, as well as to completely rebuild the Campus Parkway/Southeastern Parkway junction (Exit 210) as a Divergent Diamond Interchange (DDI) without necessitating its closure to traffic, began in 2016 and was completed in early 2018. As part of the Next Level Roads initiative, INDOT began a project in mid-2018 to extend the 6-lane section north from Pendleton to SR 9 in Anderson and to rehab the existing 4-lanes of pavement from there to the junction of SR 67 and SR 32 near Daleville. =Services= Originally, there were seven rest areas and two weigh stations located along the original length of I-69 in Indiana. Of those, only four rest areas and one weigh station remain open at present. The Pipe Creek Rest Areas serve northbound and southbound travelers in Delaware County near mile marker 250 (formerly marker 50). Totally rebuilt in 2008, these areas also serve motorists on US 35, which is concurrent with I-69 along this stretch of freeway. Near mile marker 280 (formerly marker 80) in Huntington County, there were originally twin weigh stations for commercial vehicles; however, only the southbound facility is still used. Also in Huntington County, the northbound Flat Creek Rest Area once served those heading north near original mile marker 89 (now marker 289), but joined its southbound companion (which had closed in January 2009 and was located a couple miles to the north in Wells County, just south of the Wells‚ÄìAllen county line near original mile marker 92) on the list of permanently closed rest stops by late 2012. These areas were closed due to their age, cost of maintenance and operation, as well as their relative proximity to the Fort Wayne metro area. Two other rest areas just north of that city in DeKalb County were also closed by 2001 for similar reasons. There the twin Cedar Creek Rest Areas once served northbound and southbound traffic near original mile marker 123 (now marker 323). In July 2011 it was reported that INDOT had begun building a new northbound facility at that location. In November 2012, it replaced the aforementioned Flat Creek northbound rest area further to the south, which closed upon completion of this new facility at the Cedar Creek site. Finally, between Fort Wayne and the Michigan state line the Pigeon Creek Welcome Center serves southbound motorists in Steuben County near mile marker 345 (formerly marker 145). At present there are no rest stops or weigh stations on the southern segment. History =Pre-construction (1940s‚Äì1950s)= In the 1944 study titled Interregional Highways and again, in 1947 when the original Interstate routes were first officially designated, I-69 had its northern terminus listed as the Indiana East‚ÄìWest Toll Road. But in 1956, highway officials of the state of Michigan approached their Indiana counterparts about extending I-69 north from the Toll Road and into their state along the route of US 27 to reach the proposed I-94 near Marshall. After some further studies, both states requested this change and the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) approved their proposal on January 21, 1958, making the Michigan state line the new northern terminus of I-69 in Indiana and moving its national terminus permanently into the Wolverine State. The original southern termination point of I-69 was to have been located at the northeast corner of the inner loop (now known locally as the I-65/I-70 \\"North Split\\" interchange) near 13th and College Avenue in Indianapolis. Preliminary routing of the highway from SR 38 near Pendleton to Indianapolis had it generally following the SR 67 corridor southwest, joining I-70 near German Church Road on the east side of Marion County, where the two routes would then be cosigned into the city. Later route location studies in 1961 recommended a different path, heading generally west from Pendleton to SR 37 near Fishers, then southwest past the Indianapolis outer beltway concurrent with the new location of that state route (now known as Binford Boulevard). Once well into the city, it would turn south to cross Fall Creek and meet up with the inner loop at its northeast corner. In fact, the grading and overpasses for this never-built connection's ramps can still be seen at that location. However, in 1962 the BPR ruled that it would only approve funding for I-69 to be built to the first Interstate highway connection in the Indianapolis area, which was the I-465 outer beltway near Castleton. State officials later sought to designate the proposed Northeast Freeway connecting that I-69/I-465 interchange to the North Split interchange, approximately in length, as I-165 in order to get around this initial ruling. But after a political fight over the inner-city portions of I-70 and I-65 (part of the national freeway revolt), it was eventually decided in the late 1970s to scrap the Northeast Freeway altogether. In its place, the state was allowed to use federal funds to widen I-70 from its original six lanes to eight and ten lanes as well as to rework its east side interchange with I-465 in order to handle the additional traffic loads from I-69 and the northeastern suburbs it serves. =Construction (1960s‚Äì1970s)= Like all Interstate highways in Indiana, the original I-69 was constructed in segments which when all were complete, made up the route that exists today. There were eleven segments in the federally approved original route between I-465 in the Castleton neighborhood of northeastern Indianapolis and the Michigan state line. The first section of I-69 to be completed in Indiana was the stretch in Allen County around the west and north sides of Fort Wayne between the former Upper Huntington Road (now Jefferson Boulevard), which then carried US 24 and SR 37, and Coldwater Road, which at the time was US 27 (later SR 327, but now neither). This initial portion of I-69 freeway opened to traffic on October 23, 1962. The eleventh and final segment (of the original route) to be completed was the stretch between the north leg of I-465 in Indy and the split with SR 37 at Fishers, which fully opened to traffic on November 16, 1971. =Expansion on a national scale (1990s and beyond)= Long after the route's original completion, I-69 was divided into a number of sections of independent utility (SIUs) dealing with a proposed extension of the freeway to the Mexican border in Texas. The original section of I-69 in Indiana in its entirety is now part of SIU 1. When the United States Congress enacted the Intermodal Surface and Transportation Efficiency Act in the mid-1990s, it established High Priority Corridors 18 and 20. Together these corridors mandate the construction of an Interstate highway from Port Huron, Michigan to Brownsville, Texas. The new highway was designated I-69. The routing of the highway has proven to be controversial in Indiana, as it was to become a planned toll road in southern Indiana called Southern Indiana Toll Road, or SITR. After nearly 10 years of studies and close coordination between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Army Corps of Engineers (CoE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), the final route for I-69 between Indianapolis and Evansville was announced in March 2004. At that time it was still uncertain when the extension would be built, since no funds were available to construct the $1.8 billion highway. Nonetheless, the FHWA and INDOT have been extremely methodical in the environmental studies required for the SITR to be built. State and federal highway officials opted to use a two-tier environmental study along with close coordination with the CoE, the EPA, and other state and federal agencies to ensure the proposed route can withstand any legal challenge that may be brought forth by opponents. While officials have performed studies on dozens of possible alignments over the past 30 years, the most recent round of environmental studies for the SITR have been ongoing since 1992. =SIU 1= SIU 1 includes the entire length of I-69 in 1998, from the I-465 interchange on the northeast side of Indianapolis north to Lansing, Michigan, then east to Port Huron, Michigan. It was built in stages between 1956 and 1992, with the final gap between Charlotte, Michigan, and Lansing completed on October 22, 1992. SIU 1 also includes the Interstate 469 loop around the east side of Fort Wayne that opened in stages between 1989 and 1995. When the national I-69 extension project was conceived, SIU 1 was already long completed except for the northernmost portion of I-469 which was still under construction at the time, so all future work in this segment of the \\"new I-69\\" would be limited to mainline upgrades and operational improvements. Post-construction improvements A major project in the Fort Wayne metro area began in 2002, resulting in an additional travel lane in each direction, bridge and pavement reconstruction, and interchange reconfiguration. Plans for SIU 1 also included spot improvements and pavement rehabilitation to the I-469 loop around Fort Wayne and additional mainline and interchange improvements to I-69 northeast of Indianapolis. At the north end of the Fort Wayne section, a new dogbone interchange was built in 2012 at Union Chapel Road (exit 317) to serve the then-new Parkview Regional Medical Center campus, replacing an original grade separation without Interstate access at that location. Just to the south of the Parkview complex, the junction at Dupont Road (exit 316) was rebuilt and converted into Indiana's first diverging diamond interchange (DDI) by late October 2014. On October 24, 2007, INDOT announced a $600 million plan to reconstruct the I-69/I-465 interchange on the northeast side of Indianapolis that included the widening of about of I-69, I-465, and Binford Boulevard. Environmental studies and design work were subsequently undertaken, and construction on the I-69 portion of the project was initially expected to begin in 2012. However, that portion of the plan was later severely scaled back, with the I-69/I-465/Binford Boulevard interchange still awaiting most of the planned major improvements. In the mid 2010s, the I-69 portion of the Operation Indy Commute project addressed many of the capacity issues the 2007 plan was to have corrected, by adding two new travel lanes between 82nd Street and a rebuilt split with SR 37 as well as by adding auxiliary lanes between interchanges in this same area. In December 2015, another new plan was announced to rebuild the I-69/I-465/Binford Boulevard interchange. However, construction is not scheduled to begin until 2020. INDOT widened of I-69 from four to six lanes between the 116th Street/SR 37 interchange at Fishers and the SR 38/State Street interchange in Pendleton, a project that began in 2016 and was completed in early 2018. This contract also included the reconstruction and conversion of the interchange at Campus Parkway/Southeastern Parkway (exit 210) into I-69's second DDI while maintaining traffic flow and full access for all directional movements. As a follow-up, INDOT announced in 2018 that the six-lane section would be extended by another , from Pendleton to SR 9 in Anderson. The $79-million contract also includes pavement rehabilitation for another beyond that point, to the SR 67/SR 32 interchange in Daleville. A new interchange (exit 204) at 106th Street in Fishers, constructed between April and December 2016 (with final landscaping work extending into 2017), was opened to traffic on December 7, 2016. The original two-lane grade separation without I-69 access was replaced by two separate two-lane bridges over the freeway. Each bridge carries one direction of traffic in an oval-shaped roundabout that controls traffic on 106th Street and interchange ramps to and from both directions of I-69. =SIU 2= Since the beginning of the I-69 extension project, it has long been assumed that this Section of Independent Utility (SIU) would connect I-69 SIU 1 and SIU 3 by utilizing the eastern and southern legs of the I-465 beltway in Indianapolis, although INDOT has yet to make a formal announcement as to how I-69 will be routed in or around Indianapolis. Much of this stretch of I-465 was reconstructed during the first decade of the 2000s, with additional improvements scheduled for the 2010s, totally independent of the I-69 extension project. INDOT has strongly indicated that any concurrent signing of this route along I-465 will likely not be done until the southern (SIU 3, Section 6) portion of I-69 is connected (at new Exit 5, just west of the SR 37/Harding Street interchange on the southwest side of Indianapolis). That new system interchange, part of SIU 3's Section 6, is not presently scheduled to be completed and open to traffic until around 2024. The southern leg of I-465 is the last major portion of the beltway that has yet to be widened from its original 6-lane cross-section, and is the scene of chronic traffic congestion. In conjunction with the construction of the I-69/I-465 southwest interchange at the northern end of SIU-3, several miles of I-465 between I-70 to the west and I-65 to the east will be reconstructed and widened to handle the additional traffic expected to be generated on I-465 when the last section of I-69 is completed. Scheduled to begin in 2021, and expected to be completed along with the I-69 interchange in 2024, the I-465 south project will involve a complete reconstruction and widening of I-465 from I-65 to I-70: the roadway will be reconstructed and widened to accommodate additional travel lanes; bridges and overpasses will be replaced; and interchanges at SR-67 and US-31 will be reconfigured.https://fox59.com/2019/07/08/indot-to-hold-open-house- on-i-465-project/ Fox 59, July 8, 2019 Proposed alternatives to I-465 routing of SIU 2 On November 9, 2006, Governor Mitch Daniels announced plans for a outer loop around Indianapolis to be known as the Indiana Commerce Corridor (ICC). As proposed, that route would have been 100% privately funded, with a portion of the revenues possibly applied to constructing I-69 from Indianapolis to the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC). The remaining portion of the highway to Evansville, Indiana, was already funded with funds from the Major Moves initiative. Strong opposition from local residents and the then-Democratic-controlled House of Representatives forced Daniels to abandon the ICC plan on March 24, 2007, although House Democrats assured southwest Indiana residents that this decision would not affect construction on I-69 between Indianapolis and the Crane NSWC. , there was no timeline for funding or construction of any new-terrain sections for SIU 2. If built, the Indiana Commerce Connector or similar outer loop around Indianapolis has been proposed to be designated as either I-269 or I-470. =SIU 3= From I-465 on the southwest side of Indianapolis, I-69 will follow the route of SR 37 south via Martinsville to Bloomington, at which point a new terrain routing to the southwest now serves the Crane NSWC, Washington, and Oakland City. The route intersects I-64, at southern terminus of SIU 3. Beyond there, SIU 4 of I-69 continues south along the former I-164 freeway into Evansville, where a new toll bridge is planned to enter Kentucky and cross the Ohio River near the existing US 41 bridges (just north of which I-69 temporarily ends). Tier 1 studies INDOT has taken a two-tier approach to completing the environmental impacts documentation required for construction to proceed. During the Tier 1 studies, 14 route alternatives were analyzed and compared against the \\"No-Build\\" option. Of these alternatives, nine were eliminated from consideration as either having too great of an impact on the natural and human environment, failing to achieve the stated goals established for the I-69 extension, or both. The five alternatives that remained were as follows: Alternative 1 ran from US 41 to Terre Haute and along I-70 from Terre Haute to Indianapolis. This alternative was favored heavily by Terre Haute. Alternative 2 used US 41 to Vincennes and SR 67 from Vincennes to Indianapolis; it was favored by Princeton and Vincennes. Alternative 3 was one of the two mostly overland routes along SR 57, then cutting cross country on an alignment that roughly follows SR 45, to SR 37 near Bloomington and using SR 37 to Indianapolis. This proposal was largely supported by the Evansville area but opposed by a vocal minority in Bloomington. A modified version of Alternative 3 is the current path of I-69's construction. Alternative 4 followed SR 57 to US 231 near Bloomfield and US 231 from there to Spencer. Next it went cross country to Martinsville, and either followed SR 37 from Martinsville to Indianapolis, or continued north to I-70 and used I-70 to Indianapolis. This concept had more support from the Hoosier Hills Area. Alternative 5 was the last studied and used SR 57 to US 50 bypass just south of Washington. Afterwards, it followed US 50 eastward through Daviess and Martin counties to SR 37 just east of Bedford and then SR 37 from Bedford to Indianapolis. This alternative was favored mainly by Bedford. In 2003, INDOT presented the Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to the Federal Highway Administration, which identified Alternative 3C (following SR 37 between Indianapolis and Bloomington, then over new terrain to US 231 north of Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center, then following SR 57 south-southwest to the I-64/I-164 interchange northeast of Evansville) as the least environmentally damaging practical alternative. Subsequently, in March 2003 the FHWA issued a Record of Decision approving the Tier 1 EIS for SIU 3. In November 2005, Governor Mitch Daniels announced the Major Moves initiative, which would raise billions of dollars for transportation projects by leasing the Indiana East‚ÄìWest Toll Road. Legislation enacted in March 2006 authorized Governor Daniels to lease the Indiana Toll Road to a joint-venture between Macquarie Infrastructure Group and Cintra for $3.8 billion. The same legislation also authorized a similar public-private partnership for design, construction, and operation of of Interstate 69 between Martinsville and Evansville as a toll expressway. This came following new highway legislation by Congress in January 2006 that allocated over $58 million to upgrade Indiana 37 to a full expressway from Indianapolis to Bloomington, regardless of what happened with I-69. Nearly 15 years of environmental studies wrapped up on both the toll and free sections of the I-69 extension between Indianapolis and Evansville in 2006; the project was still being considered as a toll road by then. Project engineers and designers were by then identifying exact placement of interchanges, bridge structures, and connecting roads. In June 2006, officials revisited their decision from the Tier 1 EIS to account for the effects of tolling on the route, preparing a report that concluded that the previously selected route remained the preferred alternative, even with tolls; the report was approved by the Federal Highway Administration in the fall of 2006. In October 2006, Democratic State Representatives David Crooks and Trent Van Haaften proposed revising Major Moves legislation to make the entire length of I-69 between Evansville and Indianapolis part of the Southern Indiana Toll Road. Under their proposal the SITR would be operated by either the Indiana Department of Transportation, or a public authority to be established by future legislation. Additionally, the proposal called for the SITR construction bonds to be paid off 30‚Äì40 years following the road's completion, at which point the tolls would be removed. On November 9, 2006, Governor Daniels announced that I-69 between Evansville and Indianapolis would be built as a toll-free route, effectively canceling plans for the Southern Indiana Toll Road. Tier 2 studies and lawsuits =Studies= During Tier 2 studies, INDOT further divided SIU 3 into six smaller segments, allowing work on each subsegment to proceed at its own pace. On December 21, 2006, INDOT announced completion of the Tier 2 draft EIS for the section between I-64 and SR 64 near Oakland City. Officials further noted that they would accelerate the final EIS and construction on the southernmost section from I-64 to SR 68 to facilitate access to the Toyota's Princeton plant. On April 30, Governor Daniels signed the state's two-year $26 billion budget, which included $119 million to fund construction of the southernmost segment of I-69, ensuring that construction would begin as scheduled in the summer of 2008. The Final EIS for the southernmost section was issued on October 22, 2007. On February 10, 2008, INDOT and the FHWA issued the Tier 2 Draft EIS (DEIS) for two sections from Oakland City to Crane, totaling . Of the changes to the original alternative, the DEIS extended the bridge over the Patoka River from to minimize damage to the river and adjacent wetlands. Construction on two rural interchanges would be postponed to free up $30 million for the extended bridge. INDOT released the 5,000-page Tier 2 FEIS for Section 3 from US 50 in Washington to US 231 near Crane on December 10, 2009. The ROD for Section 3 was issued in March 2010 and construction began in April 2010. The ROD for Section 2 (Oakland City to Washington) was issued in May 2010. In May 2010, Governor Daniels announced plans for I-69 to be open from I-64 to Bloomington by 2014 (Sections 1 through 4). =Lawsuits= Opposition groups, including various community groups and local governments, cited environmental issues and the cost of extending I-69. Opponents of the Southern Indiana Toll Road protested the I-69 extension, including petition signing by more than 144,000 Hoosiers along the proposed I-69 corridor and mass mailings of opposition to Governor Daniels. Other acts of protest included the vandalizing of the Indiana State Capitol by protesters who spray-painted \\"I-69 is the enemy\\" and \\"No I-69\\" on the side of the limestone building. In 2005, environmental extremists opposed to the extension set fire to I-69 project offices near Bloomington. In 2007, a group performed a mock eviction of the I-69 project office in Oakland City. There have been mixed opinions of the project. The routing was strongly opposed in Bloomington and Martinsville, while there was strong support in Evansville and Washington. The United States Navy also supported the routing because it would provide access to the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center. The new route was also supported by the Teamsters union, which represents many truck drivers, the American Trucking Association, and several trade unions representing the construction industry. A vocal minority in Bloomington and Martinsville both opposed upgrading State Road 37 to Interstate 69. The greatest support for I-69 was in Indiana's far southwestern counties and Evansville. Since the southwest corner is the only region not served by an interstate highway to Indianapolis, officials in southwest Indiana alleged that highway opponents are blocking I-69 construction in an attempt to further isolate the region from the remainder of the state. To the west, communities along US-41 favored the presently selected alignment in lieu of the only other feasible routing: I-70 to Terre Haute, then US-41 south to Evansville. After the signing of Major Moves, highway opponents immediately filed two lawsuits to block the toll road lease legislation, arguing it violated the Indiana State Constitution. Among the arguments the plaintiffs contested that funds generated from the sale of a state public works asset must go to the state's General Fund In May 2006, St. Joseph County Superior Court Judge Michael Scopelitis issued a ruling declaring it a public suit (one that questions a public improvement) and as such required the plaintiffs to post a $1.9 billion bond to continue the suit. In response plaintiffs appealed the ruling to the Indiana Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court's ruling. With no means for the opposition to post the bond, Major Moves, and thus the proceeding of the Southern Indiana Toll Road, took effect with the closing of the deal on June 29, 2006. On October 3, 2006, protest groups, citing environmental concerns, along with six individuals who live along the I-69 corridor, filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that state and federal agencies rigged environmental studies and violated several federal laws in the selection of a new-terrain route for I-69. They further pressed the court for a summary ruling directing the FHWA and INDOT to route I-69 over I-70 and US 41. Judge David Hamilton disagreed, and on December 10, 2007, he issued a 58-page ruling upholding the selected route for I-69 and the Tier 1 ROD. His ruling did, however, leave open the possibility that the FHWA and INDOT could be forced to reconsider some or all of the previously-rejected Tier 1 alternatives if there are new significant findings during the Tier 2 studies that were absent from the Tier 1 EIS. Barring any new major findings in the Tier 2 studies, Judge Hamilton's ruling paved the way for construction to begin on the southernmost segment. Construction begins On December 12, 2007, the FHWA issued its ROD giving final federal approval for construction to begin on the section between I-64/I-164 and SR 64 near Oakland City. Retrieved December 11, 2007. INDOT awarded the first SIU 3 construction contract to Gohmann Asphalt and Construction Company of Sellersburg, Indiana, on February 6, 2008. This contract, completed on May 31, 2008, included the removal of buildings and vegetation from the I-69 right-of-way between I-64 and SR 68. Gohmann also won the construction contract for the first from I-64 to SR 68 with a $25 million bid. Construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony in Evansville on July 16, 2008. INDOT built this first section of the extension of I-69 using the design-build method. The first open segment On September 29, 2009, the first of the I-69 extension opened when traffic was shifted from the short segment of SR 57 between I-64 and SR 68 to the portion of the new I-69 route mentioned above. There was some initial confusion as the shift and detour were unannounced and poorly signed initially. This resulted in numerous accidents when motorists either drove through the dead end on the old SR 57 or inadvertently ended up in opposing lanes of traffic on I-164 in the days following the I-69 opening. State troopers directed traffic through the new I-69 segment until crews could install additional signage to more clearly mark the new route. The former SR 57 roadway between SR 68 and I-64 was closed off with a cul de sac and now serves as a local access road. Completion to Bloomington The remaining mileage in Section 1, along with all of Section 2 and Section 3, for a total of from SR 64 to US 231 near the Crane NSWC, was opened to motorists on November 15, 2012. Section 4, from Crane to SR 37 in Bloomington, approximately in length, was completed, and opened to traffic on December 9, 2015. The final link: Bloomington to Indianapolis =Section 5: Current construction status= Construction on Section 5 to upgrade SR 37 through Bloomington to Martinsville to Interstate standards at a cost of $425 million was completed October 31, 2018. Under a public-private partnership, I-69 Development Partners was originally responsible for construction of the section. However, the partnership experienced multiple delays from the original completion date of October 2016 due to financial and other difficulties, including several work stoppages by subcontractors who cited a lack of being paid in the agreed to manner by the private group. On August 14, 2017, the State of Indiana terminated the P3 arrangement with I-69 Development Partners, citing default on the contract terms and construction being delayed two years from the initial October 2016 completion deadline. INDOT assumed direct oversight of Section 5 construction, and contracted with Walsh Construction to serve as the prime contractor for the remainder of the project. Walsh is overseeing several subcontractors retained from the I-69 Development Partners P3 arrangement that are performing the earthworks, structure erection, paving, and other work to complete Section 5. As work wrapped up, the FHWA approved the designation of the highway as Interstate 69 up to Martinsville on September 18, 2018, and signage was installed. =Section 6= The routing of I-69 Section 6 from Martinsville to Indianapolis was again studied by INDOT, with five candidate finalist routes selected from nearly two-dozen options. On March 30, 2016, INDOT announced that I-69 would complete its route to Indianapolis following the current right-of-way of the SR 37 expressway. The interstate will be constructed along the path of SR 37 from Martinsville ‚Äî through Morgan, northwest Johnson, and southwest Marion counties ‚Äî connecting with I-465. The only significant deviation from the present alignment of SR 37 would be just south of the junction at I-465, where the freeway will deviate slightly to the west to allow the present Harding Street interchange of I-465 to remain, with only slight modification to its western ramps. INDOT reported that studies have shown that this preferred routing would reduce crashes and congestion the most, affect less forest and farm acreage, and result in the greatest decrease in travel time. The SR 37 routing also reduces the cost of the project by eliminating the need for a bridge over the White River between Martinsville and I-465. The path also impacts the most businesses, which had been a concern raised by Martinsville residents, business owners, and lawmakers. Unlike the P3 arrangement initially sought for Section 5, INDOT plans to complete Section 6 through traditional procurement methods, with multiple contracts scheduled to be let over several fiscal years. On February 8, 2018, a combined Tier 2 FEIS and Record of Decision (ROD) was published for Section 6. On September 4, 2018, $600 million in funding for I-69 Section 6 was announced by Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb, with a goal of speeding up I-69 Section 6 completion to 2024. Construction of access roads and improvements to local roads in the corridor began in Martinsville in 2019. Construction of the freeway itself will begin in Morgan and Johnson counties in 2020. INDOT plans to completely close SR 37 between SR 144 and SR 39 during a portion of 2021 to allow quicker progress. Start of construction in Marion County has not been determined, but could be as early as 2021. The freeway will have two lanes in each direction in Morgan County, three lanes in each direction from Smith Valley Road to Southport Road in Marion County, and four lanes each direction from Southport Road to I-465. Total cost of Section 6 is estimated to be $1.5 billion, which includes $700 to $800 million in actual construction costs. Financing construction To fund construction of this extension, Indiana Governor Daniels introduced a proposal known as \\"Major Moves\\" in early 2006. It provided $700 million from the Indiana Toll Road lease to be used to complete nearly 20 years of environmental studies and construct about half of the proposed extension (between the I-64/164 interchange and the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center). It also allowed for the construction of of the I-69 extension to Evansville to be constructed as the Southern Indiana Toll Road. Due to ongoing controversy over making this portion of the extension a toll- road, the governor announced in November 2006 that the entire stretch of the highway would be toll-free, subject to construction of the Indiana Commerce Connector (SIU 2). Officials with the INDOT have since stated that I-69 will be toll-free regardless of whether or not the Indiana Commerce Connector is constructed. Additionally, the U.S. Congress allocated an additional $14 million in the 2005 SAFETEA-LU authorization to construct I-69 Evansville to Indianapolis.Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), The 2014-2015 Indiana State budget placed $400 million in a \\"Major Moves 2020\\" fund, some of which will go towards completing I-69. INDOT and the Indiana Finance Authority released a request for qualifications on May 23, 2013, for a public-private partnership agreement to complete the of Section 5 of SIU 3, with four proposals shortlisted on July 31, 2013. When SIU 3 and the Indiana portion of SIU 4 are completed, I-69 in Indiana will be approximately long. Designation extension In April 2010, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) petitioned the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to change the designation of the I-69 extension from \\"Proposed Route 69\\" to \\"Interstate 69\\", citing the of the extension already open to traffic, and a total of out of from the southern terminus of the original I-69 to the Ohio River near Evansville that would be open by the end of 2012. The ruling would allow INDOT to erect I-69 signs on portions of I-465 between the current interchange with I-69 in the northeast and the proposed interchange on the southwest, and reset reference posts (RP) and renumber exits and reference posts on the original section north of Indianapolis (starting with RP 200 instead of the then-current RP 0). The latter task was accomplished by the end of 2012. =SIU 4= This section of I-69 in Indiana incorporates the former I-164 south from I-64 into the Evansville metro area. Eventually I-69 will deviate from the existing freeway to cross into the state of Kentucky on a new toll bridge over the Ohio River. At the October 18, 2013, AASHTO meeting, an INDOT request for re-designation of of I-164 to I-69 between US 41 and I-64 was approved, pending concurrence from the FHWA. Signage was changed to I-69 beginning the week of November 17, 2014. Ohio River crossing (ORX) The original plan (in a DEIS prepared by INDOT in 2004, but later dropped) was for I-69 to leave the now-former I-164 alignment somewhere just east of Green River Road (exit 3) and head south (instead of turning west with I-164) for approximately before crossing the Ohio at a point near the mouth of the Green River. This portion of the route had not then been funded, as construction of the new Ohio River crossing and its approaches in both states was expected to cost approximately $800 million. Indiana and Kentucky officials had said construction on the new Ohio River Bridge would not begin until at least 2020, after two new crossings near Louisville were completed. With Indiana then preparing to break ground on SIU 3, Kentucky officials indicated that collecting tolls might be the only feasible option for completing the I-69 bridge, as traditional federal and state funding for such projects were drying up. , neither Kentucky nor Indiana officials had yet come up with the money to plan and construct this I-69 bridge. In 2016, both states initiated a renewed push to build the bridge, and the present I-69 Ohio River Crossing (I-69 ORX) project was born. The process was broadened to study several alternative alignments for the river crossing, and the possibility of making it a tolled facility was approved. As of February 2018, a new DEIS was in the process of being prepared, a project website had been set up, public involvement and input were being solicited, and the preliminary routing alternatives had been narrowed to three. By June of that year, refinements had been made in all three proposed alternatives based on public input and additional engineering data. On December 14, 2018, the central corridor was chosen as the preferred route with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion for a new terrain bridge east of existing US 41. Controversies The routing for SIU 3 of I-69 in Indiana was particularly controversial. The planned extension to Evansville pitted cities, towns, and counties against one another. The greatest support for an extended I-69 was in Indiana's far southwestern counties and Evansville, while the greatest opposition was between Indianapolis and a vocal minority based in Bloomington. Some in Bloomington and Martinsville opposed upgrading SR 37 to I-69, while still others welcomed this improvement. The opposition led to Southwestern Indiana communities accusing highway opponents further north of trying to isolate this region from the rest of the state by blocking construction of a direct highway link to Indianapolis. To the west, communities along US 41 favored the selected alignment in lieu of the only other feasible routing: I-70 to Terre Haute, then US 41 south to Evansville. Terre Haute preferred the I-70/US 41 routing over the selected routing of I-69 for local economic reasons. Despite the SR 37 routing ultimately being chosen, an Interstate- quality bypass was built east of Terre Haute (SR 641), to connect US 41 and I-70. INDOT, current and past governors, and businesses and elected officials in Evansville and adjacent southwest Indiana communities, favored a direct route via Bloomington that would be built over new terrain from Bloomington to Evansville. Supporters argued that this direct route reduces the travel time to Indianapolis as well as improves access to Bloomington for residents of southwestern Indiana, something a route via Terre Haute would not achieve. INDOT officials also pointed out that SR 37 would eventually be upgraded from a four-lane expressway to full freeway status with or without I-69. After extensive review of the alternative routes as well as detailed environmental studies, the state selected the new terrain route via Bloomington. Environmentalists pointed out the construction of I-69 would lead to the destruction of of forest and more than of wetlands. The route selected passes through the Patoka River National Wildlife Refuge but on a corridor that the federal government purposely did not acquire for the refuge. This was because of an agreement with the state not to dispute the passage of a highway on this corridor. Environmental groups then filed suit in federal court on October 2, 2006, to block further study and construction of the route, but the lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Judge David F. Hamilton on December 12, 2007, clearing the way for construction to begin in 2008. Opponents had considered appealing Judge Hamilton's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (which could have possibly sent the case to the Supreme Court of the United States), but they ultimately abandoned further legal challenges to the proposed route. Instead, opponents tried to block construction through the legislative process, when Democrats in the Indiana House of Representatives stripped funding for the I-69 extension in their version of the 2008 two-year state budget. Money for I-69 was restored after budget negotiations with the Republican-controlled Indiana Senate. Another area of controversy arose in late 2005 when governor Mitch Daniels proposed levying tolls on the highway to finance its construction, either as a state project or a public-private partnership, in order to accelerate the project. As the route would overlay the existing SR 37 between Bloomington and Indianapolis, and there is no other free alternative route between Bloomington and Martinsville, this proposal has raised concerns among local residents and businesses. In March 2006, Daniels signed a bill known as \\"Major Moves\\" that leased the Indiana East‚ÄìWest Toll Road, but also included a compromise on constructing I-69 in southwest Indiana. As part of the deal, the legislation permitted the Governor to enter a similar public-private partnership for construction of of I-69 as the Southern Indiana Toll Road from Martinsville to the I-64/I-164 interchange, while the remaining from Martinsville to the I-465/SR 37 interchange in Indianapolis would remain toll-free. On June 20, 2006, the Indiana Supreme Court rejected a legal challenge brought on by I-69 opponents, upholding Major Moves legislation in a 4‚Äì0 decision. The toll road option was highly unpopular, even among many who supported the extension via Bloomington. As a result, Governor Daniels announced in December 2006 that I-69 through southwest Indiana would be toll-free. =Protests= While Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads had continued to rally crowds of opponents to appear at public hearings until it was apparent that their voice did not reflect the wishes of the majority of impacted Hoosiers, other organized protester groups conducted acts of vandalism, ranging from spray-painting graffiti on the Indiana Statehouse in June 2005; to attempted arson at the I-69 regional planning office in Bloomington in July 2005; to the breaking of windows of a private pro-I-69 business in Evansville in June 2008. In the case of the Statehouse incident, two-dozen protesters were arrested on charges from disorderly conduct due to an assault against a police officer. In addition to incidents in Indianapolis, numerous incidents have also occurred in and around the construction sites, while it was located in Gibson County. Especially active has been a group called Roadblock Earth First which imported protesters from out of state and which has been responsible for a number of vandalism incidents in Oakland City and at a Haubstadt asphalt yard given the contract for the first segment. In 2009, two protesters were arrested on charges of felony racketeering for disrupting public meetings in 2007 and 2008. These protests and acts of vandalism were widely viewed as an effort to intimidate proponents of I-69. Exit list Exit numbers on the new southern section of I-69 are a continuation of the old I-164 exit numbering. Starting on August 6, 2012, the state of Indiana began renumbering all exits and reference posts on the original route of I-69 from I-465 to the Michigan state line by adding 200 to each value; it was decided to add an even 200 despite the fact that the new extension is only in order to minimize confusion. Related routes =Auxiliary route= There is one auxiliary Interstate Highway for I-69 in Indiana, I-469, the beltway around the south, east, and north sides of Fort Wayne. =Indiana Commerce Connector= The Indiana Commerce Connector (ICC) was a proposed , Interstate-grade, partial outer beltway on the south and east sides of Indianapolis that was put forward by Governor Mitch Daniels in November 2006. The proposed road segment would have been numbered either I-269 or I-470 and connected four Interstate highways at six locations. Proposed as a privately built toll road, it would have extended southward from Pendleton at I-69, through Greenfield at I-70, Shelbyville at I-74, Franklin at I-65, Martinsville at SR 37 (future I-69), to a southern terminus at I-70 near Mooresville. On March 24, 2007, Governor Daniels withdrew the proposal for the ICC due to lack of public support. It has been suggested that the ICC be signed as either I-269 or I-470. In April 2014 the logistics group Connexus Indiana and others came out in favor of reactivating the proposal for the Indiana Commerce Connector. However, the Indy Chamber (formerly the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce) is among those who have stated opposition to the plan.

In 2003, Cream Abdul Babar released 2 split CDs, both recorded and engineered by Billy Anderson. The first, again released on At A Loss Recordings, was a split full-length LP & CD with Kylesa. The second was with Seattle-based art/noise/metal band Teen Cthulhu. This was released on Hyperrealist Records, based out of Savannah, GA. At this time, the band added their eighth member, Will Galloti, as second guitarist, moving Tradd Sanderson exclusively to noise / soundscapes. In 2004, the Public Guilt label, also based out of Baltimore, released a double-disc remastered re-issue of all of Cream Abdul Babar's older self-released material and out of print splits, 7\\" releases, remixes and live material. This compilation is entitled \\"Excavation 1995-1998. It includes \\"Backwater of Masculine Ethics,\\" \\"Buried in Broken Glass,\\" the I Guard The Sheep split 7\\", and a slew of other material, all remastered. Cream Abdul Babar continue to be an influential band in the avant- metal scene, and are known to play live on occasion. The band played a reunion show in Tallahassee, FL on April 8th, 2017, nearly 10 years after their previous show.

But his grandfather and father were killed during a fishing accident. Ten-year-old Tsukasa, who was also on the boat when the tragedy occurred, saw them speared by a giant swordfish. By chance, its eyes met Tsukasa's, leaving him with a phobia regarding fish eyes. Hence, Tsukasa was forced to give up sushi. Fifteen years later, Tsukasa, who had taken up on Jinenry≈´ (Ëá™ÁÑ∂ÊµÅ), a form of martial arts modeled to mimic nature's life-forms, is once again thrown into the world of sushi when he learns that to perfect the Jirenry≈´ is to be able to perfect sushi making (the kneading part) and vice versa.

It is defined mathematically as the sum of the closing volume and the residual volume. The alveoli lack supporting cartilage and so depend on other factors to keep them open. The closing capacity is less than the Functional Residual Capacity, the amount of gas that normally remains in the lungs during respiration This means that there is normally enough air within the lungs to keep these airways open throughout both inhalation and exhalation. As the lungs age, there is a gradual increase in the closing capacity (i.e. The small airways begin to collapse at a higher volume/before expiration is complete). This also occurs with certain disease processes, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary edema. Any process that increases the CC by increasing the closing volume (CV) can increase an individual's risk of hypoxemia, as the small airways may collapse during exhalation, leading to air trapping and atelectasis. A mnemonic for factors increasing closing capacity is ACLS-S: Age, Chronic bronchitis, LV failure, Smoking, Surgery. Alternatively, CLOSE: Cigarettes, LV failure, Old age, Surgery, Emphysema (& asthma). Often supine positioning will decrease functional residual capacity (FRC) but has no effect on closing capacity.

The epicenter was located on the Pacific coast in the Mexican state of Colima. The earthquake was felt as far away as Mexico City and in southern parts of the United States. Effects The 2003 Colima earthquake resulted in the death of 29 people and 300 injured. Additionally, approximately 10,000 were left homeless as the earthquake destroyed 2,005 homes and seriously damaged 6,615. Most of the deaths and damage occurred in Villa de √Ålvarez, a city which borders the northern part of the city of Colima. Extensive damage (rating VIII) occurred in the city of Colima and in Tecom√°n. Some deaths and damage occurred in the states of Jalisco and Michoac√°n and a few buildings were damaged as far away as Guanajuato and Morelos. The quake was felt strongly (rating VI) in parts of Mexico City. It was also felt in most of Mexico and in the United States in Corpus Christi, Texas, Dallas, Texas and El Paso, Texas. Occupants of high- rise buildings in Houston, Texas also reported feeling its effects. Landslides closed a segment of the Colima-Guadalajara Highway and the port of Manzanillo. Power and telephone outages occurred in Mexico City. A local tsunami of about 1 m (peak-to-trough) was recorded at Manzanillo. A seiche was observed on Lake Pontchartrain in the US state of Louisiana, and sediment was stirred up in several Louisiana wells. Tectonic summary This shallow earthquake occurred in a seismically active zone near the coast of central Mexico. The earthquake occurred near the juncture of three tectonic plates: the North American Plate to the northeast, the Rivera Plate to the northwest, and the Cocos Plate to the south. Both the Rivera Plate and the Cocos Plate are being subsumed beneath the North American Plate. The slower subducting Rivera Plate is moving northwest at about 2 cm per year relative to the North American Plate and the faster Cocos plate is moving in a similar direction at a rate of about 4.5 cm per year. Several significant earthquakes have occurred near the recent event. In 1932, a magnitude 8.4 thrust earthquake struck about 100 km to the north- northwest. On 9 October 1995, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck about 50 km to the northwest killing at least 49 people and leaving 1,000 homeless. The most deadly earthquake in the region occurred about 170 km to the south-east on 19 September 1985. This magnitude 8.0 earthquake killed at least 9,500 people, injured about 30,000, and left 100,000 people homeless.

He was born in Morganfield, Kentucky and was shipped to South Korea as a corporal in the U.S Army. Beginning in the 1960s, four American soldiers defected to North Korea. Larry Allen Abshier was the first to desert in May 1962 when he crossed the Demilitarized Zone and was apprehended by North Korea. Joe Dresnok, Jerry Parrish and Sergeant Charles Robert Jenkins would follow Abshier across the border. His reasons for defecting, according to Jenkins' autobiography The Reluctant Communist, were \\"personal, and [Parrish] didn't elaborate about them much except to say that if he ever went home, his father-in-law would kill him.\\"The Reluctant Communist. Charles Robert Jenkins (University of California Press) p. 34 Along with three other defectors, he was eventually granted citizenship. He married a Lebanese woman, Siham Shraiteh, and together they had three sons (two of them named Michael and Ricky), all of whom remain in North Korea. Jenkins, in his autobiography, claims that Siham and three other Lebanese young women were lured to North Korea under false pretenses, then married to the Americans. However, one of the girls had well-connected parents and got all four returned. Siham was already pregnant, though, so her family sent her back to North Korea. Siham appears in the film Crossing the Line, and vehemently denies the allegations that she was kidnapped or forced to go to North Korea, affirming that she is there by choice. Also according to the film, Parrish died after 20 years of kidney trouble. Siham and their children remain in North Korea.

GLUT5 allows for fructose to be transported from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte by facilitated diffusion due to fructose's high concentration in the intestinal lumen. GLUT5 is also expressed in skeletal muscle, testis, kidney, fat tissue (adipocytes), and brain. Fructose malabsorption or Dietary Fructose Intolerance is a dietary disability of the small intestine, where the amount of fructose carrier in enterocytes is deficient. In humans the GLUT5 protein is encoded by the SLC2A5 gene.  Regulation  Fructose uptake rate by GLUT5 is significantly affected by diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, fructose malabsorption, and inflammation.

It consists of a receiving antenna which receives the signal to be radiated in the tunnel, and a transmitting antenna installed in the tunnel, which is either a Yagi antenna or a line antenna. In principle, a tunnel transmitter can work purely passively, in which case the received signal is passed over a cable to the antenna in the tunnel. Active systems, however, are more often used. In some cases the radio frequency inside the tunnel is different from the one used by the broadcaster. More often the program inside is transmitted on the same frequency as outside, in which case the information signal should be demodulated or converted to an intermediate frequency in the outside receiver, and then modulated/shifted back in the transmitter. Otherwise feedback may occur. Tunnel transmitters are used in Germany only for audio transmitters working in FM-range and for further radio services, such as mobile phone services which also work in this frequency range. Elsewhere, there are also tunnel transmitters for audio broadcast transmitters, which work in the long and medium wave bands. An example of this is in the Dartford Crossing tunnel near London, where the programme \\"Virgin 1215\\" in the medium-wave band and the BBC's Radio 4 on 198 kHz long wave are rebroadcast in the tunnel.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. SS Alcoa Partner was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 493) on 9 June 1942 at Wilmington, California, by the Consolidated Steel Corp.; launched on 7 September 1942; sponsored by Dorothea Rasmussen Kunkel; acquired by the Navy on 16 March 1943; converted for naval service as a cargo ship by the Matson Navigation Co.; renamed Auriga on 29 March 1943 and designated AK-98; and placed in commission at San Francisco, California, on 1 April 1943, Lt. Comdr. John G. Hart in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Upon her commissioning, the cargo ship was assigned to the Naval Transportation Service. When the conversion work had been completed, she got underway on 6 June for Port Hueneme, California, to load cargo and departed the U.S. West Coast on 14 April, bound for the Fiji Islands. The vessel reached Viti Levu, Fiji Islands, on 3 May and began discharging cargo. Unloading was completed on the 28th, and she then reversed her course and proceeded back to the west coast of the United States. Upon her arrival in San Francisco, the ship entered a shipyard for repair work which was completed by early July when Auriga moved to Alameda, California, to load equipment and supplies for transportation to New Caledonia. = Serving the South Pacific bases = The vessel put out to sea on 19 July and, upon her arrival at Noum√©a on 7 August, unloaded her cargo. She completed this task on 21 August and sailed once more for the Fijis. The ship touched at Suva on the 24th; discharged equipment and supplies; and, three days later, began the voyage back to the United States. She arrived at San Francisco on 13 September, reloaded her holds, and moved to San Diego, California. On 1 October she stood out to sea, bound for the Ellice Islands. Auriga reached Funafuti on the 16th but, the next day, moved on to Wallis Island, Samoa, and remained in port there through 12 November. She then returned to Funafuti, where she carried out cargo operations into January 1944. On the 17th, the vessel got underway for Tarawa, Gilbert Islands, and spent the next week unloading cargo despite frequent enemy bombing attacks. She departed the Gilberts on the 24th and headed for Hawaii. = Ship repairs at Pearl Harbor = The ship moored at Pearl Harbor on 1 February and unloaded all her cargo before entering the navy yard there for repairs and alterations. On the 22d, Auriga moved to Honolulu for loading operations and got underway on the 29th for Eniwetok. She reached her destination on 11 March and began sending cargo and fresh water to various small craft. The ship took on Army equipment and got underway for Kwajalein on 8 April. The ship anchored off Kwajalein on the 10th and sailed two days later for Hawaii. = Saipan invasion operations = Shortly after returning to Pearl Harbor, Auriga was slated to take part in the invasion of Saipan in the Marianas. The vessel began taking on Army combat vehicles, ammunition, heavy artillery, and other supplies and embarked troops. On the morning of 1 June, the ship sortied with Task Group (TG) 51.18. After a pause at Kwajalein to refuel, TG 58.18 arrived off Saipan on the 16th; and Auriga began debarking troops and equipment. The next day, the ship retired from Saipan and, during the next eight days, steamed with various task groups while awaiting orders to return to waters off that embattled island. On 25 June, Auriga touched at Saipan and began unloading operations. Despite enemy air harassment, she completed the process on the 28th and left the area. She anchored at Eniwetok and remained there nearly one month. The ship weighed anchor on the 27th and set a course for Pearl Harbor. After her arrival there on 3 August, the ship entered the navy yard for repairs and alterations. = Invasion of the Philippines operations = On the 31st, Auriga sailed for Hilo, Hawaii, where she embarked marines, combat equipment, and ammunition. The ship headed back toward Pearl Harbor on 6 September and got underway again on the 15th, bound for Eniwetok. After briefly touching there, the cargo ship was routed on to Manus Island, Admiralties, a staging point for the invasion of the Philippine Islands. She left Manus on 14 October and, six days later, anchored in Leyte Gulf and commenced discharging cargo ashore. = Damaged by a Japanese plane attack = Still off the beachhead on 25 October, Auriga underwent a Japanese air attack during which her commanding officer and four other crew members were wounded. The next day, she set a course for Peleliu in the Palaus. After a one-day stop there, the vessel proceeded to Hollandia, New Guinea. = Delivering cargo at Leyte Gulf = Following a brief period in port, Auriga was assigned to a reinforcement group bound for Biak, Schouten Islands. Upon her arrival there, she began loading a cargo of vehicles and Army Air Corps equipment. She got underway on 14 November to return to Leyte. The vessel arrived in Leyte Gulf four days later and began sending her cargo ashore. In spite of heavy enemy air activity, Auriga completed her task on the 19th and left that evening to return to Hollandia. = Lingayen Gulf operations = The attack cargo ship remained there for a week before being ordered to Aitape, New Guinea, to take on equipment, ammunition, and Army troops. She got underway on 28 December and set a course for the Philippine Islands and the invasion of Luzon. Auriga was assigned to TG 78.5 whose ships reached Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945 and began unloading operations shortly after their arrival. Three days later, her holds were empty, and she sailed for Leyte. = Luzon invasion operations = While at Leyte, the cargo vessel was ordered to begin preparations for another assault on Luzon in the San Felipe-San Narcisco area. Auriga got underway for this operation on 26 January and arrived off the west coast of Luzon on the 29th. The unopposed landing was completed on the 31st, and the ship returned to Leyte where she remained in upkeep into March. = Okinawa invasion operations = On 13 March, Auriga began taking on cargo, and she got underway on the 27th. She entered Ulithi Lagoon three days later, awaited further orders, and set sail on 7 April for Okinawa. The vessel anchored off Hagushi beach on the 11th and immediately encountered stiff enemy air opposition, but managed to discharge all of her passengers and cargo by the morning of the 17th. Two days later, she left Okinawa and returned to Ulithi. = Final wartime operations = The ship paused there to refuel and to embark passengers for transportation to the United States. She got underway for home on 25 April, sailed into San Francisco Bay on 12 May, and shortly thereafter entered a shipyard for alterations and repairs. Her repairs and shakedown were completed on 26 June, and she resumed cargo operations. The ship got underway on 8 July, shaped a course for the Marshalls, and during the next month delivered cargo to both Eniwetok and Kwajalein. Auriga was then routed to Espiritu Santo to pick up more cargo. = End-of-war activity = Upon reaching Espiritu Santo on 15 August, the ship received word of the Japanese capitulation. She loaded supplies and equipment, got underway for Guam on the 23d, and entered Apra Harbor on 1 September. There, she took on cargo to support occupation forces in Japan. After a brief stop at Iwo Jima, Auriga sailed to Japan. The vessel reached Yokosuka on 12 October and began discharging supplies ashore. She later embarked Army and Navy personnel for transportation back to the United States. The ship left Japan on 27 November and proceeded to Pearl Harbor. She then sailed on to the Panama Canal Zone, transited the canal on 27 December, and continued on to the east coast of the United States. Auriga reached New York City on 3 January 1946; discharged her passengers, cargo, and ammunition; and began preparations for deactivation.  Post-war decommissioning  She was decommissioned at the New York Naval Shipyard on 22 January 1946 and was returned to the Maritime Commission for disposal. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 7 February 1946. She was sold later that year and was refitted for merchant service.

A tenth ship (Royal Frederick) was ordered on 29 October 1827 to the same design, but was launched in 1833 as Queen to a fresh design by Sir William Symonds. Armament In the original configuration, the armament of the Caledonia class was consistent for the first three ships of the class. The exception was an increase in firepower on the poop deck from 2 to 6 18-pounder carronades. Starting with the fourth ship, the armament of the class was significantly modified to adhere to the principle of a unified caliber of 32 pound. All guns on the middle and upper gun decks were replaced with the same number of 32-pounders. Except for two 24-pounders on the middle deck that were replaced by two 8 inch shell guns. Four of the 12-pounder guns on the quarterdeck were replaced with 32-pounder carronades. The remaining two were increased to 18-pounders, along with the two 12-pounders on the forecastle, and the carronades on the poop deck were removed. By 1847 the armament had been brought to the 32 pounder standard. Size The last five ships of the class were built to a slightly broadened version of the draught, and this sub-class was armed in the same way as the last of the standard Caledonias, . Except for Caledonia herself, all these ships were converted into steam-powered screw battleships during the 1850s.

Compared to a microwave radio relay station with active components, a passive repeater is far simpler and needs little maintenance and no on-site electric power. It also does not require additional frequencies, unlike active repeater stations which use different transmit and receive frequencies to prevent feedback. The corresponding disadvantage is that without amplification the returned signal is significantly weaker. Passive radio relay link deflection systems in the vertical level can be realized by receiving the signal with a parabolic antenna and leading it through a waveguide to a second parabolic antenna, where it is radiated. For passive microwave radio relay link deflections in the horizontal plane, flat surfaces of metallic material are used, arranged so that the angle of incoming beam corresponds to the angle of the outcoming signal. The resulting structure resembles a billboard. Similar systems are used also occasionally for TV relay transmitters or as tunnel transmitters. In these cases, a Yagi antenna receives the transmitted signal and supplies it by way of a coaxial cable to a second Yagi antenna.

It is the culmination of Nikon's rangefinder development which started in 1948 with the Nikon I, and was \\"arguably the most advanced rangefinder of its time.\\" Nikon SP It was manufactured by the Japanese optics company Nippon Kogaku K. K. (Nikon Corporation since 1988).http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/discontinue/filmcamera.htm#rangefinder. Further development of Nikon's S series ended with the introduction and success of the Nikon F. In 2005 2,500 models of a repro model were manufactured under the name of \\"Nikon SP Limited Edition\\". The camera was exclusively sold in Japan and came with a (modern multi-coated) W-Nikkor 3.5 cm f/1.8 lens.Nikon SP Limited Edition, by Nikon Features The Nikon SP has dual viewfinders providing frame lines for a total of six focal lengths. The main viewfinder has 1x magnification and has frame lines for 50 mm, 85 mm, 105 mm and 135 mm (selected by rotating a dial under the rewind crank). The frames are parallax-corrected and the focusing patch appears in the centre of the viewfinder. A separate, smaller viewfinder (less than life size) to the left of the main viewfinder has non-parallax corrected frame lines for 35 mm. The entire window acts as a frame for 28 mm lenses. The camera uses Nikon's 'S' bayonet lens mount which is a modified Contax 'C' bayonet and Contax 'C' lenses are physically compatible but do not accurately focus with the built-in rangefinder. In common with Contax, a small toothed wheel in front of the shutter release is used to focus lenses that use the internal bayonet. The camera does not have a flash sync on its hot shoe. Instead a pc sync socket is provided. The shutter on early models is a horizontally running mechanically timed rubberized silk fabric curtain. In 1959 the shutter curtain was changed to titanium similar to the Nikon F. The camera will advance film at a rate of 3 FPS with an added S-36 motor drive. This made the SP the first rangefinder to have motorized film advance.

Early life  Born 20 September 1982 in Sydney, Australia, Horton was raised in the city before moving to Liverpool, England, (the native home of his parents) as a teenager. His first season of cricket in England was played at Winstanley Park, a team based in Billinge, Wigan, with which he impressed and got noticed by Lancashire. The following season he played his club cricket at Sefton Park CC in Liverpool, as this league was of a higher standard. He then joined the Lancashire youth set up and captained the U17 and U19 teams. Retrieved on 28 September 2008. Cricket career =Lancashire= Horton joined the Lancashire first team squad in 2003. He came close to scoring his maiden first-class century in July 2005 when he scored 99 batting at number four against Essex in a drawn match; he was dismissed by Grant Flower two overs before the end of the day. After failing to cement a place in the Lancashire team Horton spent the winter of 2006/07 playing grade cricket in Australia to improve his batting. He spent the season playing for Ginninderra Cricket Club in Canberra. He also represented the Canberra Comets in the second tier Cricket Australia Cup which is a state second XI competition one level below first-class status. After several seasons of impressing in second XI cricket, Horton finally broke through and established himself in the first team. In May 2007 Horton hit his maiden century for Lancashire with 139 in a County Championship match against Worcestershire; his effort came on the final day of a drawn match and he spent 12 overs marooned in the 90s. A few weeks later in August, Horton bettered that with a 149 against their great rivals Yorkshire; this came in a partnership of 258 with Stuart Law for Lancashire's highest partnership for any wicket in first-class cricket against Yorkshire, beating the previous record of 247 set by Graham Lloyd and Ian Austin in 1997. Also in August the same year, Horton set another career best of 152 against Hampshire in a drawn match. A successful 2007 season for Horton was recognised by the club when he received his Lancashire Cap and was named Lancashire Player of the Year at the end of the season. He finished the season with 1,034 championship runs at an average of 49.23. As a result of his on field exploits, Horton was named the BBC North West Sports Awards Newcomer for 2007. In May 2008, Horton scored 108 against a Durham bowling attack including Steve Harmison, who had been dropped from the England side, before being run out. His century was part of a Lancashire victory by 232 runs as James Anderson and Andrew Flintoff shared 16 wickets in the match. Horton scored his sixth first-class century, and his second against Yorkshire, in May 2008. He scored 152, equalling his best score, and shared a partnership of 258 with Mohammad Yousuf who went on to score 205* as the match was drawn, equalling Lancashire's record for any partnership against Yorkshire. In July 2008, Lancashire captain Stuart Law expressed the view that Horton was playing well enough to play for England but that his batting could still improve After a series of good performances in the Lancashire's first-class side, Horton stated that he wanted to play more one day cricket. On 25 August 2008, Horton scored his maiden list A half- century. Batting at number three, he top scored for Lancashire with 56 from 75 balls against Sussex. Over the 2008/09 winter season, Horton played club cricket in Australia; he captained Gosnells cricket team in Western Australia. In March, Horton was part of the Lancashire squad which toured the United Arab Emirates and took part in the Pro ARCH Trophy. He scored a century against Sussex, and finished as the third-highest run-scorer of the tournament. Horton began the 2009 English season by scoring a century in Lancashire's opening first-class match. Opening the batting against Durham University, he scored 105 runs from 182 balls before being stumped. On 26 April 2009, Horton scored his maiden list A century after missing the first one-day game of the season through injury; opening the batting with Tom Smith, he scored 100 off 108 balls as Lancashire won by 6 wickets. Despite registering several low scores in the opening matches of Lancashire's county championship campaign, Horton' one-day form was good and he scored his second listA century on 4 May. Becoming only the fourth Lancashire player to score centuries in successive one-day matches, Horton scored 111 not out from 144 balls as Lancashire beat Derbyshire by 8 wickets. =Matabeleland Tuskers (2010‚Äì11)= In late 2010, Horton was signed by Zimbabwean side Matabeleland Tuskers. He described his role in the squad as \\"... to get runs in all forms of the game and also bring an approach and a dedication to the game that rubs off on the rest of the squad. To have that added responsibility on my shoulders can only make me a better person and a better cricketer in the forthcoming season for Lancashire.\\" In a match against the Mountaineers in November, Horton scored his first T20 half-century, beating his previous best of 44. He set another personal best two months later in a match against Southern Rocks; Horton scored his maiden first-class double-century. The innings of 209 beat his previous highest score of 173. =Leicestershire= In September 2015, it was announced that Horton had signed a three-year deal with Leicestershire.

It expands the broadcast range of a television or radio station beyond the primary signal's original coverage or improves service in the original coverage area. The stations may be (but are not usually) used to create a single-frequency network. They may also be used by an FM or AM radio station to establish a presence on the other band. Relay stations are most commonly established and operated by the same organisations responsible for the originating stations they repeat. However, depending on technical and regulatory restrictions, relays may also be set up by unrelated organisations ‚Äì such as community groups in areas that would otherwise not be served. Types =Broadcast translators= In its simplest form, a broadcast translator is a facility created to receive a terrestrial broadcast over the air on one frequency and rebroadcast the same (or substantially identical) signal on another frequency. These stations are used in television and radio to cover areas (such as valleys or rural villages) which are not adequately covered by a station's main signal. They can also be used to expand market coverage by duplicating programming on another band. =Boosters and distributed transmission= Relays which broadcast within (or near) the parent station's coverage area on the same channel (or frequency) are known in the U.S. as booster stations. Signals from the stations may interfere with each other without careful antenna design. Radio interference can be avoided by using atomic time, obtained from GPS satellites, to synchronize co-channel stations in a single-frequency network. Analog television stations cannot have same-channel boosters unless opposite (perpendicular) polarization is used, due to video synchronization issues such as ghosting. In the U.S., no new on- channel UHF signal boosters have been authorized since July 11, 1975. A distributed transmission system (DTS or DTx) uses several medium-power stations (usually digital) on the same frequency to cover a broadcast area, rather than one high-power station with repeaters on a different frequency. Although digital television stations are technically capable of sharing a channel, this is more difficult with the 8VSB modulation and unvariable guard interval used in ATSC standards than with the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) used in the European and Australian DVB-T standard. A distributed transmission system would have stringent synchronization requirements, requiring each transmitter to receive its signal from a central source for broadcast at a GPS-synchronized time. A DTS does not use broadcast repeaters in the conventional sense, since they cannot receive a signal from a main terrestrial broadcast transmitter for rebroadcast; to do so would introduce a re-transmission delay destroying the required synchronization, causing interference between transmitters. The use of virtual channels is another alternative, although this may cause the same channel to appear several times in a receiver ‚Äì once for each relay station ‚Äì and require the user to tune to the best one (which may change due to propagation issues such as weather). Although boosters or DTS cause all relay stations to appear as one signal, they require careful engineering to avoid interference. =Satellite stations= Some licensed stations simulcast another station. Relay stations in name only, they are generally licensed like any other station. Although this is unregulated in the U.S. and widely permitted in Canada, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates radio formats to ensure diversity in programming. U.S. satellite stations may request an FCC exemption from requirements for a properly staffed broadcast studio in the city of license. The stations often cover large, sparsely populated regions or operate as statewide non-commercial educational radio and television systems. =Semi-satellites= A television re-broadcaster often sells local (or regional) advertising for broadcast only on the local transmitter, and may air a limited amount of programming distinct from its parent station. Some \\"semi-satellites\\" broadcast local news or separate news segments during part of the newscast. CHEX-TV-2 in Oshawa, Ontario, aired daily late-afternoon and early-evening news and community programs separate from its parent station, CHEX-TV in Peterborough, Ontario. The FCC prohibits this on U.S. FM translator stations, only permitting it on fully licensed stations. In some cases, a semi-satellite is a formerly autonomous full- service station which is programmed remotely through centralcasting or broadcast automation to avoid the cost of a local staff. CBLFT, an owned-and- operated station of the French-language network Ici Radio-Canada T√©l√© in Toronto, is a de facto semi-satellite of its stronger Ottawa sibling CBOFT; its programming has long been identical or differed only in local news and advertising. A financially weak privately owned broadcaster in a small market can become a de facto semi-satellite by gradually curtailing local production and relying on a commonly owned station in a larger city for programming; WWTI in Watertown, New York, relies on WSYR-TV in this manner. Broadcast automation allows the substitution of syndicated programming or digital subchannel content which the broadcaster was unable to obtain for both cities. Some defunct full-service stations (such as CJSS-TV in Cornwall, Ontario, now CJOH- TV-8) have become full satellite stations and originate nothing. If programming from the parent station must be removed or substituted due to local sports blackouts, the modified signal is that of a semi-satellite station. =National networks= Most broadcasters outside North America, portions of South America, and Japan maintain a national network, and use relay transmitters to provide service to a region (or nation). Compared with other types of relays, the transmitter network is often created and maintained by an independent authority (funded with television license fees); several major broadcasters use the same transmitters. In North America, a similar pattern of regional network broadcasting is sometimes used by state- or province-wide educational television networks such as Kentucky Educational Television, UNC-TV, Vermont Public Television, PBS Wisconsin, Maryland Public Television, TVOntario or T√©l√©-Qu√©bec. A state or province establishes an educational station and extends it with several full-power transmitters to cover the entire jurisdiction, with no capability for local-programming origination. In the U.S., a regional network of rebroadcast sites may join the national Public Broadcasting Service as a member station. Relay transmitters by country =Canada= In Canada, \\"re-broadcaster\\" or \\"re-broadcasting transmitter\\" are the terms most commonly used by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Television A television re- broadcaster may sell local or regional advertising for broadcast only on the local transmitter. Rarely, they may air limited programming distinct from their parent station. Some \\"semi-satellites\\" broadcast local newscasts or separate news segments in part of a newscast. There is no strict rule for the call sign of a television re-broadcaster. Some transmitters have call signs different from the parent station (CFGC in Sudbury is a re-broadcaster of CIII), and others use the call sign of the originating station followed by a number (such as the former CBLFT-17 in Sarnia, Ontario). The latter type officially includes the television station's -TV suffix between the call sign and the number, although it is often omitted from media directories. The numbers are usually applied sequentially, beginning with \\"1\\", and denote the chronological order in which the station's rebroadcast transmitters began operation. Some broadcasters may use a system in which the number is the transmitter's broadcast channel, such as CJOH-TV-47 in Pembroke, Ontario. A broadcaster cannot mix the numbering systems under a single call sign; the transmitters are numbered sequentially or by their analogue channel. If sequential numbering reaches 99 (such as TVOntario's former broadcast transmitters), the next transmitter is assigned a new call sign and numbered \\"1\\". Translators which share a frequency (such as CBLT's former repeaters CBLET, CBLHT, CBLAT-2 and CH4113 on channel 12) are given distinct call signs. Digital re-broadcasters may be numbered by the TV channel number of the analogue signal they replaced. TVOntario's CICO-DT-53 (digital UHF 26, Belleville) is an example; the station was converted in 2011 to vacate an out- of-core analogue channel (UHF 53), and retains CICO-TV-53's former analogue UHF television call-sign numbering as a surviving TVO repeater. Low-power re- broadcasters may have a call sign consisting of the letters CH followed by four numbers; for example, CH2649 in Valemount, British Columbia, is a re- broadcaster of Vancouver's CHAN. Re-broadcasters of this type are numbered sequentially in the order they were licensed by the CRTC, and their call signs are unrelated to the parent station or other re-broadcasters. Although the next number in the sequence (CH2650 in Anzac, Alberta) is a re-broadcaster of CHAN, this is because CH2649 and CH2650 were licensed simultaneously; the following number, CH2651, is a re-broadcaster (also in Anzac) of Edmonton's CITV. A station's re-broadcasters are not necessarily named in the same manner; CBLT had re-transmitters with their own call signs (some used CBLT followed by a number, and some used CH numbers). CBC and Radio-Canada owned- and-operated re-transmitters were shut down on August 1, 2012, along with most TVOntario transmitters (which often were located at Radio-Canada sites) and some Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) transmitters in the far north. Private commercial broadcasters operate full-power re-broadcasters to obtain \\"must carry\\" status on cable television systems. Transmitters in small markets with one (or no) originating stations were, in most cases, not required to convert to digital even if operating at full power. Transmitters broadcasting on UHF channels 52‚Äì69 were required to vacate the channels by August 31, 2011; some (such as a CKWS-TV re-transmitter in Brighton, Ontario, and three TVOntario sites) went digital as part of a move to a lower frequency but do not provide high-definition television, digital subchannels or any functions beyond that of the original analogue site. Radio Like a TV station, a radio re-broadcaster may have a distinct call sign or use the call sign of the originating station followed by a numeric suffix. The numeric suffix, however, is always sequential. For a re-broadcaster of an FM station, the numeric suffix is appended to the FM suffix; re-broadcasters of CJBC-FM in Toronto are numbered CJBC-FM-1, CJBC-FM-2, etc. If an AM station has a re- broadcaster on the FM band, the numeric suffix falls between the four-letter call sign and the FM suffix; CKSB-1-FM is an FM re-broadcaster of the AM station CKSB, and CKSB-FM-1 would be a re-broadcaster of CKSB-FM. A broadcaster is limited to two stations on one band in a market, but a possible means to obtain a third FM signal in-market is to use a re-broadcaster of the AM station to move the signal to low-power FM. In Sarnia, Blackburn Radio owns CFGX-FM (99.9) and CHKS-FM (106.3); its third Sarnia station, CHOK (1070 kHz), uses an FM repeater for city coverage as Country 103.9 FM (although the AM signal remains the station's official primary transmitter). Low-power radio re-broadcasters may have a call sign consisting of VF followed by four numbers; however, a call sign of this type may also denote a low-power station which originates its own programming. Some stations licensed under the CRTC's experimental-broadcasting guidelines, a special class of short-term license (similar to special temporary authority) sometimes granted to newer campus and community radio operations, may have a call sign consisting of three letters from anywhere in Canada's ITU-prefix range followed by three digits (such as CFU758 or VEK565). Other stations in this license class have been assigned conventional Cxxx call signs. Former re-broadcasters have occasionally been converted to originating stations, retaining their former call sign; examples include CITE-FM-1 in Sherbrooke, CBF-FM-8 in Trois-Rivi√®res and CBAF-FM-15 in Charlottetown.http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Decisions/1994/DB94-339.HTM; compare with http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Notices/1993/PB93-136.htm where CBAF-FM-15 was considered by the CRTC as a rebroadcaster. =Mexico= In Mexico, translator and booster stations are given the call sign of the parent station. Television Most television stations in Mexico are operated as repeaters of the networks they broadcast. Translator stations in Mexico are given call signs beginning with XE and XH. Televisa and Azteca maintain two national networks apiece. Televisa's Canal de las Estrellas network includes 128 stations (the most in Mexico), and Azteca's networks have 88 and 91 stations. The stations may insert local advertising. Azteca's stations in larger cities may include local news and a limited amount of regional content; Televisa prefers to use its non-national Gala TV network and Televisa Regional stations as outlets for local production. A number of translators also serve areas with little or no signal in their defined coverage area, known as ('shadow channels'). Most shadow channels air the same programming as their parent station. The northern and central regional network Multimedios Televisi√≥n in Monterrey uses the same system to a smaller extent (its XHSAW- TDT is the shadow channel of main station XHAW-TDT in Monterrey), with regional output for local newscasts and advertising on a master schedule. There are two main national networks of non-commercial TV stations in Mexico. One is the Canal Once (or XEIPN-TDT) network, operated by the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional (IPN). Operating 13 transmitters, it airs its programs under a contract with the Quintana Roo state network. The other network, operated by the Sistema P√∫blico de Radiodifusi√≥n del Estado Mexicano (SPR), has 26 stations (16 operational); most are digital. The SPR transmitters are almost exclusively in cities where the IPN never built stations, and carry Canal Once as one of the five educational networks in the multiplex of the digital station. Twenty-six of Mexico's 32 states also own and operate television services, and 16 use more than one transmitter. The largest (by number of stations) is Telemax, Sonora's state network, with 59 transmitters. Many state-network transmitters broadcast at a low effective radiated power (ERP). A few stations are owned by municipalities or translator associations. Like state networks, they transmit at very low power. Transmitters re- broadcasting Mexico City stations to Baja California and other communities along the Pacific coast normally operate on a two-hour delay behind the originating station; there is a one-hour delay in Sonora, and Quintana Roo (one hour ahead of central Mexico in 2015) receives programs one hour later than they are broadcast to most of the rest of Mexico. Radio Ten to 15 FM shadow channels exist, and they are required to be co-channel with the stations they re-transmit. Quintana Roo has the most FM shadow channels (seven), about half the national total. Three more FM shadows are authorized: XETIA-FM/XEAD-FM (Ajijic, Jalisco) and XHRRR-FM (Tecolula, Veracruz). =United States= Radio In July 2009, the basic FCC regulations concerning translators were: * FM translators may be used for cross-band translation; this removed the restriction preventing FM translators from re- transmitting AM signals. * No translator (or booster) may transmit anything other than the simulcast of its licensed parent station, except for emergency warnings (such as EAS) and 30 seconds per hour of fundraising. * The parent station must identify all its translators and boosters between 7 and 9a.m., 12:55 and 1:05 p.m., and 4 and 6p.m. each broadcast day, or each must be equipped with an automated device (audio or FSK) for hourly identification. * Maximum power is 250 watts ERP for a translator, and 20 percent of the maximum allowable ERP for the primary station's class for a booster. There is no limit on height for fill-in translators within the service contour of the primary station. * A translator (or booster) must stop transmitting if the parent station's signal is lost; this helps prevent unauthorized re-transmission of other stations. There is one way programming may differ between a main station and an FM translator: an HD Radio signal may contain digital subchannels with different programming from the main analogue channel, and a translator may broadcast programming from the originating station's HD2 subchannel as the translator's main analogue signal. W237DE (95.3 MHz in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) broadcasts the format formerly carried by WTCY (1400 AM, now WHGB), receiving the signal from a WNNK (104.1 FM) HD2 digital subchannel for analogue rebroadcast from the WNNK tower site on 95.3. It is legally an FM repeater of an FM station, although each signal would be heard with unique content by users with analogue FM radio receivers. Commercial stations may own their translators (or boosters) when the translator (or booster) is in the parent station's primary service contour; they can only fill in where terrain blocks the signal. Boosters may only be owned by the primary station; translators outside a primary station's service contour cannot be owned by (or receive financial support from) the primary station. Most translators operate by receiving the main station's on-air signal with a directional antenna and sensitive receiver and re-transmitting the signal. They may not transmit in the FM reserved band from 88 to 92 MHz, where only non-commercial stations are allowed. Non-commercial stations may broadcast in the commercial portion of the band, however. Unlike commercial stations, they can relay programming to translators via satellite if the translators are in the reserved band. Translators in the commercial band may only be fed by a direct on-air signal from another FM station (or translator). Non-fill-in commercial-band translators may not be fed by satellite, according to FCC rule 74.1231(b). All stations may use any means to feed a booster. All U.S. translator and booster stations are low-power and have a class D license, making them secondary to other stations (including the parent); they must accept interference from full-power (100 watts or more on FM) stations, while not causing any of their own. Boosters must not interfere with the parent station in the community of license. Licenses are automatically renewed with that of the parent station and do not require separate applications, although the renewal may be challenged with a petition to deny. FM booster stations are given the full call sign (including an -FM suffix, even if there is none assigned) of the parent station plus a serial number such as WXYZ-FM1, WXYZ-FM2, etc. FM translator stations may use sequential numbered call signs consisting of K or W followed by a three-digit number (201 through 300, corresponding to 88.1 to 107.9 MHz), followed by a pair of sequentially-assigned letters. The format is similar to that used by numbered television translators, where the number refers to the permanent channel assignment. The largest terrestrial radio- translator system in the U.S. in October 2008 belonged to KUER-FM, the non- commercial radio outlet of the University of Utah, with 33 translator stations ranging from Idaho to New Mexico and Arizona.KUER-FM on-air broadcast statement, accessed Oct. 9, 2008 Television Unlike FM radio, low-power television stations may operate as translators or originate their own programming. Translator stations are given call signs which begin with W (east of the Mississippi River) or K (west of the Mississippi, like regular stations) followed by a channel number and two serial letters for each channel; the first stations on a channel are AA, AB, AC and so on). Television channels have two digits, from 02 to 51 (formerly 02 to 83); FM radio channels are numbered from 200 (87.9 MHz) to 300 (107.9 MHz), one every 0.2 MHz (for example, W42BD or K263AF). An X after the number in these call signs does not indicate an experimental broadcasting license (as it may in other services), since all 26 letters are used in the sequence. When the sequence is exhausted, another letter is added. This has already happened for translator on channels 7 and 13 in K territory; what is now KMNF-LD was assigned callsign K13AAR-D in September 2018 and K07AAH-D in May 2019. Numbered translator stations (a format such as W70ZZ) are typically low-power repeaters ‚Äì often 100 watts (or less) on FM and 1,000 watts (or less) on television. The former translator band, UHF television channels 70 through 83, was originally occupied primarily by low-powered translators. The combination of low power and high frequency limited broadcast range. The band was reallocated to cellular telephone services during the 1980s, with the handful of remaining transmitters moved to lower frequencies. Full-power repeaters such as WPBS-TV's identical-twin transmitter, WNPI-TV, are normally assigned TV call signs like other full- power stations. These \\"satellite stations\\" do not have numbered call signs, and must operate in the same manner as other full-power broadcasters. This simulcasting is generally not regulated by the FCC, except when a station owner seeks an exemption from requirements such as restrictions on owning several full-service stations in the same market, limits on overlap in coverage area between commonly-owned stations, or requirements that each full- service station have a local studio and a skeleton staff capable of originating programming locally. These exemptions are normally justified on the basis of economic hardship, where a rural location unable to support a full-service originating station may be able to sustain a full-power re- broadcaster. Some stations (such as KVRR in Fargo, North Dakota) are chains of as many as four full-power transmitters, each with its own call sign and license, covering a large, sparsely-populated region. LPTV stations may also choose a four-letter call sign with an -LP suffix (shared with low-power FM) for analog or -LD for digital; this is generally done only if the station originates programming. Class A television stations are assigned calls with -CA and -CD suffixes. Digital stations which use numbers receive a -D suffix, such as W42BD-D. All are despite the fact that most of the full-power digital television stations had their -DT (originally -HD) suffixes dropped by the FCC before -D and -LD were implemented. Digital LPTV stations have their digital RF channel numbers as part of their digital call sign, which may differ from the virtual channel (the analog number). Numbered broadcast translators which are moved to another frequency are normally issued new call signs to reflect the updated channel assignment. This is not true of displaced translators using another frequency temporarily under a special technical authority. Although K55KD could retain its call sign while it was displaced temporarily to channel 57 to resolve interference to MediaFLO users, W81AA would have received a new call sign when channel 81 was deleted from the bandplan. On the rare occasion that a station moves back to its original channel, it receives its old call sign (which is not reused by another station). =Digital transition= Low-power television stations are not required to simulcast a digital signal, nor were they required to cease analog operation in June 2009 like full-power stations. Full-power stations used for simulcasting another station were (like other full-service TV broadcasters) required to convert to digital in June 2009. The FCC defines \\"TV satellite stations\\" as \\"full-power broadcast stations authorized under Part 73 of the Commission's rules to re- transmit all or part of the programming of a parent station that is typically commonly owned\\". Since most satellite stations operate in small or sparsely- populated areas with an insufficient economic base to support full-service operations, many received FCC authorization on a case-by-case basis to flash cut from analog to digital on the same channel instead of simulcasting in both formats during the digital transition. Although no digital television mandates were forced on existing low-power television stations, Congress passed legislation in 2008 funding low-power stations which went digital by the conversion date or shortly thereafter. Some low-power stations were forced to change frequency to accommodate full-power stations which moved to UHF or operated digital companion channels on UHF during the transition period. By 2008, low- and full-power channel 55 licensees were encouraged to relocate early to free spectrum for Qualcomm's MediaFLO transmitters. By 2011, remaining LPTV broadcasters on UHF channels 52 through 69 were forced onto lower channels. Many transmitters on the original UHF 70‚Äì83 translator band had to move twice; channels 70‚Äì83 were lost to mobile phones in 1983, followed by channels 52‚Äì69 between 2009 and 2011. Many low-power translators were also directly affected by a parent station's conversion to digital television. Translators which received an analog over-the-air signal from a full-service television station for rebroadcast needed to convert their receiving equipment, like individual viewers used digital converter boxes. Although the signal transmitted by the repeater may have remained analog, the uplink had to be changed. Twenty-three percent of the 4,000 licensed translators received a $1,000 federal-government subsidy for a portion of the additional equipment. Many other translators went dark after the digital-transition deadline, or did not apply for new channels after UHF channels 52‚Äì69 were removed from the bandplan. Some small translators operated by directly converting a parent station's signal to another frequency for rebroadcast, without any other local signal processing or demodulation. W07BA (a 16-watt repeater for WSYR-TV in Syracuse, New York) was a simple piece of broadcast apparatus, shifting the main station's signal from channel nine to channel seven to cover a small valley in DeWitt. Syracuse became a UHF island, WSYR-TV's main ABC signal became a 100 kW digital broadcast on channel 17, and there is no longer a channel 9 signal to feed the repeater. Translators in remote locations with no commercial power were expected to have problems deploying equipment for a digital uplink. Although many translators continued analog broadcasts and a minority transitioned to digital, some rural communities expected to find all local translator signals gone as a result of the originating stations' transition. Controversy By law, full-service local broadcasters are the primary occupants of the FM broadcast band; LPFM and translators are secondary occupants, with theoretically-equal status. In practice, however, frequencies assigned to translators become unavailable to new LPFM stations or existing stations wishing to upgrade. Some distinctions place small, local LPFM operators at a disadvantage: * The maximum power for an LPFM station (10 or 100 watts, depending on station class) is less than that of the largest FM broadcast translators (250 watts), limiting the reach of the LPFM signal. * Minimum spacing (in distance and frequency) between stations is less strict for translators than for LPFM applicants. Although translator spacing is based on signal contour levels (accounting for terrain and obstacles), LPFM stations have a more restrictive minimum-distance requirement. * An LPFM broadcaster is required to generate local content; if there are several applicants for a frequency, those who agree to originate eight (or more) hours a day of local programming are favored. Translators are not required to originate anything locally. * LPFM licenses are normally issued to non-commercial educational entities (such as schools or municipalities), and are subject to requirements precluding several commonly-owned stations; this is not true of translators. A non-commercial translator with no local or educational content can occupy space in the non-commercial segment (below 92 MHz) of the FM broadcast band. During the narrow FCC filing windows for new applicants, applications for broadcast translators from the same (or related) entities can request every locally-available frequency in several communities. * An LPFM license or construction permit cannot be resold; this is not true for translators. Related entities can file applications for thousands of translator construction permits (using non-commercial status for exemption from FCC filing fees) and resell the construction permits, even if the transmitters have not yet been constructed. Broadcast translators for commercial stations are normally required to receive a signal from their parent full-service FM station over the air and re-transmit in the region covered by the main station, eliminating the need for a translator except where terrain shielding is a problem). This restriction does not apply to non-commercial educational stations. Any non-commercial station, even one with no local or educational content, can apply for an unlimited number of translators to be fed by any means (including satellite). All take spectrum from local LPFM stations or rebroadcasters of local full-service stations. Existing National Public Radio repeaters were displaced by new religious stations in Lake Charles, Louisiana, losing local and educational content. =2003 translator boom= A 2003 FCC licensing window for new translator applications resulted in over 13,000 applications, most from religious broadcasters. Due to the number of license applications, LPFM advocates called it the Great Translator Invasion. Some broadcasters have taken advantage of FM translator regulations allowing non- commercial stations to feed distant translators with satellite-delivered programming hundreds (or thousands) of miles from the parent station's coverage area. Not all translators can be fed by satellites, however; only translators in the non-commercial portion of the FM band (88.1 to 91.9 MHz) can be \\"satellators\\". All other translators must be directly fed off the air, except for \\"fill-in\\" facilities in a primary station's service contour. Translators may feed other translators, so it is possible to create small chains of translators fed from one distant station; if one translator failed, however, the network beyond the failed translator would go dark. The number of 2003 applications overwhelmed the FCC, which issued an emergency hold order on new translator applications until those already received were processed. The rules change sparked a series of lawsuits known as Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC. Religious broadcasting stations such as Calvary Chapel's KAWZ (Twin Falls, Idaho), the Educational Media Foundation and Family Radio's KEBR (Sacramento) were relayed by hundreds of FM \\"translator\\" stations across the country. Since the parent stations were owned by non-profit organizations and were on the non-commercial part of the spectrum, they were not required to have their translators receive their signal over the air. LPFM advocates allege that the proliferation of translators poses difficulties for non- translator station operators (particularly LPFM license applicants), who say that they cannot get stations on the air because translators occupy available channels in an area. Since \\"satcasting\\" translators are only permitted on the non-commercial part of the spectrum (where LPFM stations do not exist), they do not threaten the ability of LPFM licensees to expand their facilities. Non- satcasting translators may be a problem for LPFM stations; if an LPFM station is \\"bumped\\" from its channel by a new full-power station, there may be no available frequency to which to move. Proposed rules would revise the procedures by which nonprofit groups may apply for translators (prohibiting more than a certain number of translator applications to be owned by any one entity), and the FCC modified its channel requirements for LPFM broadcasters to free channel space. REC Networks petitioned the FCC to prioritize LPFM stations. =Satellite translator networks= Areas with no available FM spectrum for LPFM stations due to large, distant translator networks include Chicago (with several Calvary Chapel and Educational Media Foundation stations), Atlanta (with several Way-FM ‚Äì associated with K-Love and Salem Communications ‚Äì and Edgewater Broadcasting stations) and Dallas, Texas (with Calvary Satellite Network and American Family Radio). Smaller markets like Louisville, Kentucky, and Knoxville, Tennessee, lack LPFM channels due to distant translators by broadcasters such as Calvary Chapel and Way-FM. The largest satellite-fed translator networks were linked to Calvary Chapel (including Radio Assist Ministry, Horizon Broadcasting, Edgewater Broadcasting and REACH Media) and American Family Radio, owned by the American Family Association. The networks associated with Calvary Chapel have been a focus of translator-based networks; multiple applications were submitted by companies linked to Calvary Chapel for the same channel. At least four radio stations operated by Calvary Chapel churches and relaying Calvary Satellite Network programming have been identified as \\"home stations\\" for distant translators, and many home churches (in addition to the national Calvary Chapel concerns) applied for licenses. American Family Radio, in particular, has demonstrated a deliberate strategy to crowd out re-broadcasters of National Public Radio stations for political purposes. =Australia= Radio Australia's national radio networks (Radio National, ABC NewsRadio, Triple J, ABC Classic FM and SBS Radio) have relay transmitters which allow each service to be broadcast as widely as possible. The ABC and SBS allow community-based relay transmitters to rebroadcast radio or television in areas which would otherwise have no service. Commercial radio broadcasters normally have relay transmitters only if local geography (such as mountains) prevents them from broadcasting to their entire market. Television Since the early-1990s market aggregation, each television broadcaster uses multiple relays to provide consistent service throughout Australia's large markets. Although each market is subdivided due to the legacy of previous commercial broadcasters (Southern Cross Nine maintains two stations in the Victoria market: GLV and BCV), the only difference between these sub-markets in practice is news service and local advertising. Except in major cities, all major television broadcasters use the same network of transmitters (which may have dozens of relay stations in each market). As a result, some areas have had trouble beginning digital or HD service due to problems with regional transmitters. =Europe= Because most radio and television systems in Europe are national networks, the radio or television system in some countries can be considered a collection of relay stations in which each broadcaster uses a transmitter network (developed by the public broadcaster or maintained through a government-funded authority) to provide broadcast service to the entire nation. =Asia= In most parts of Asia, satellite is the preferred method of national signal coverage. Exceptions include Singapore (which bans civilian ownership of satellite receivers) and Malaysia, which only allows civilian ownership of receivers provided by Astro). Terrestrially, the scenario is similar to Europe's; the systems are considered national networks, and are a collection of relay stations maintained by a government-funded authority. In Japan, however, television stations are owned and operated by networks or are affiliates owned by other media companies.

The impetus for the bill was the \\"Philip Sheedy Affair\\". Sheedy's 1997 prison sentence was remitted in an irregular manner in 1998 by one judge after intervention from another judge acquainted with Sheedy's sister. The media broke the story in 1999 and the government responded to the controversy by asking the Chief Justice to make a report, which criticised the conduct of both judges, who each resigned after initially stating they would not. The ad-hoc nature of the investigation and the voluntary nature of the sanctions were considered unsatisfactory. In 2000, a report into the affair by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure declined to make recommendations regarding practice and procedure in criminal courts, because of \\"serious issue of a constitutional nature relating to the separation of powers\\". The bill was published on 27 March 2001, the same day as bills for amendments numbered 21, 23, and 24. The government wanted to expedite passage of all four bills through the Oireachtas to have simultaneous referendums on 7 June, before the summer holidays. The Twenty-second Amendment bill passed its second reading on 1 May 2001, and the committee stage was scheduled for the following day.D√°il debates Vol.535 cc.111‚Äì144 Overnight, the Minister for Justice John O'Donoghue tabled 14 amendments to the Bill, a procedure which the Opposition condemned as cavalier; in the absence of cross- party support the government withdrew the Bill from the Order Paper.D√°il debates Vol.535 cc.505‚Äì514 It lapsed when the 28th D√°il dissolved. The Twenty- third Amendment passed at referendum; there is therefore a gap in the numbering since there is no Twenty-second Amendment to the Constitution. In 2010, the Government announced the Judicial Council Bill 2010, which aims to address the same issues without amending the Constitution.

The school is a specialist Performing and Visual Arts College. From September 2007, the school admitted boys for the first time as it changed its status from a single sex girls' school to a co-educational community school. The Norwood School Website Its pupils travel from across the local education authority mainly from Brixton, Streatham and Vauxhall and a small proportion from neighbouring boroughs.Ofsted, (2002), Oftsed Inspection Report, 2002 History Norwood School for Girls was established in 1958 as a secondary school for girls aged between 11 and 16 by the London County Council.London County Council, (1962), Secondary Schools in Bermondsey, Lambeth and Southwark, Division 8, page 13 The school was originally based in Gipsy Road in West Norwood housed in a Victorian building built for the 1875 establishment of a London School Board school.1895 Kelly's London County Suburbs Directory (Southern Suburbs) It has always therefore been a quite separate institution from the Norwood School of Industry which dominated Elder Road, West Norwood during most of the 19th century. Original school uniform colour was Maroon. Became Norwood school for Girls and Boys in 2007. Although the buildings on Gipsy Road were originally designed to hold a large number of pupils (up to 1000) the premises were deemed to be insufficient to house the two schools during the 1960s and it was agreed that another site would have to be found to at least accommodate the senior year groups. Building began of a new Upper School on Crown Dale,Lawrence, Tucker, Scott, Varnava (1988), Norwood Was a Difficult School, p. 114. near the junction with Elder Road in West Norwood, opposite Norwood Park, a relatively short distance from the school‚Äôs current site on Gipsy Road, which ran down another side of the same park. In 1971, on 21 April, years three to six moved to the brand new and much vaulted Upper School, whilst the first and second years remained in Gipsy Road in what was now called the Lower School,Lawrence, Tucker, Scott, Varnava (1988), Norwood Was a Difficult School, p. 115. sharing this with a primary school, known as Norwood Park Primary School. The only piece of furniture allowed in the new building from the old was the kneehole desk from the Head‚Äôs room in Gipsy Road. The new site also had grounds that had been planted with a multitude of shrubs and flowers. A very clear attempt was made at this time to impress upon students and commentators alike that the name of the school was Norwood or Norwood School, to reflect its comprehensive nature and move away from the secondary modern nomenclature. However, the colloquial references to Norwood Girls' or Norwood Girls' School were as old as the school and remained.Lawrence, Tucker, Scott, Varnava (1988), Norwood Was a Difficult School, pp. 114‚Äì115. Eventually, the first and second years moved to the site on Crown Dale in the late 1980s where the school remains to the present day. In September 2005 the school was awarded Specialist Status in Performing and Visual Arts, areas in which the school had a tradition from its earliest times and reflected in the careers of its more illustrious alumni. From September 2007, the school‚Äôs admittance of boys as well as girls firmly relegated the Norwood Girl‚Äôs tag as the school changes its status from a single sex girls' school to a co-educational community school. This change has been reported as being in response to the needs and demands of Lambeth parents. Education The school originally provided five and six year courses in a variety of subjects. The first three years a general course was taken to provide a good foundation. From the fourth year three courses were available. The Academic: leading to the General Certificate of Education examination; The Commercial, including general clerical work, shorthand and typing, all leading to the relevant public examinations; and Technical leading to public examinations involving Housecraft, needle trades, pre-nursing, woodwork and metalwork. Outside of the academic the school had a number of societies and of particular pride were the choral and orchestral music, drama and dancing activities, a trend that continues today in the school‚Äôs designation as a Specialist in Performing and Visual Arts. The sports played were cricket and tennis in the summer, hockey and netball in the winter. Today, the school teaches the national curriculum but its specialist status in Performing and Visual Arts (awarded in September 2005) means that younger students receive weekly lessons in art, dance, drama and music, taught by specialist teachers in state-of-the- art studios. The school selects 10% of its year seven intake based on Arts aptitude, selected by audition / workshop, and interview. The school has benefited from an extensive building programme, and is equipped with a wide range of Visual Arts facilities; drama studios; a suite of music rooms, including a recording studio; and is one of the only schools in Lambeth to have the benefit of two purpose built mirrored dance studios; as well as a fully equipped theatre. Older students continue in one or more expressive arts subjects at key stage four, and students can continue their studies in the sixth form, as part of an Arts pathway, or in combination with other academic and vocational subjects. Outside of the arts and strong core curriculum subjects, students are offered courses including Health and Social Care, Business Studies, Psychology, Sociology, Film Studies, Media Studies and Government and Politics. The range of subject options in the sixth form means that The Norwood School also increasingly takes new students transferring from other schools in the area. Uniform In 1971, when the school moved to Crown Dale, a new airforce blue uniform was chosen as part of the range of ideas to mark a new start for the school. this remained the colour of the uniform until September 1989 In 1989 the uniform was changed to navy blue and in 2007 the purple uniform was adopted for years 7-11. Sixth form students do not wear uniform. Student Council and Organisation Every tutor group has a Form Captain and a Vice-Captain who act as the front line of contact for the tutor group. There is then a Student Council containing representatives from every Form Group in the school. The school also operates a system of having Head Girl or Head Boy who serve a term of office that lasts for a year, marking the student in question out as exemplary in all areas.

History The KFH-FM call letters were reprised from those of the Wichita station that began broadcasting on September 19, 1948, at 100.3 mHz as a simulcast partner of sister station KFH (AM) (1330 kHz). Around 1967, KFH-FM moved to 97.9 MHz and became known as \\"Channel 97.\\" Channel 97 broadcast with the \\"progressive rock\\" music format. It was also affiliated with ABC's American FM Radio Network. In late 1971, KFH-FM dropped the progressive rock format and switched to a \\"beautiful music\\" format and the call letters KBRA. (That station is now KRBB, and owned by iHeartMedia, Inc..) The KFH-FM calls were retired on October 12, 2016. 98.7 FM was issued a construction permit on March 27, 1992, issued as KSQB. The station signed on July 4, 1995 with a Country format as KSPG, \\"The Kansas Pig\\", and then a satellite-fed Hot AC format as KAYY. On March 24, 2000, 98.7 became the new home of Smooth Jazz KWSJ. The format was moved from its temporary frequency at 92.7 and was originally on 105.3 (Now Hot AC KFBZ-FM). KWSJ's Smooth Jazz format was dropped on March 25, 2002, and flipped to a simulcast with AM sister station KFH.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2002/RR-2002-03-22.pdf On May 9, 2011, KFH AM and -FM changed their format to sports talk. During the summer of 2016, KFH-AM began simulcasting on translator K248CY 97.5 FM in Wichita, enabling the station to be heard on 3 separate frequencies (97.5/98.7 FM & 1240 AM). However, it offered a more stable signal in the eastern part of the Wichita Metropolitan Area. Entercom announced in October of that year that KNSS would be taking over the 98.7 frequency, giving Wichita its first full-power FM news/talk station since May 2011, when KFH dropped News/Talk in favor of a Sports format. The switch has not come without controversy, though, as listeners in the Anthony, Harper, Hutchinson and Winfield/Arkansas City areas are not able to receive the 97.5 frequency well, if at all.

Channel 10 kept the KAKE-TV call sign, so AM 1240 had to slightly change its call letters to KAKZ. By the 1980s, as music listening to AM radio shifted to FM, AM 1240 added more talk shows. In 1985, the call sign changed to KRZZ. =KNSS= By the 1990s, the station became all-talk.

Porta is a two-time golden boot winner, having won the award whilst at River Plate and most recently at Nacional in Uruguay's Primera Divisi√≥n. His nickname is \\"El Canguro\\", which means \\"The Kangaroo\\" in Spanish. Early life Porta was born at Fairfield Hospital in Sydney, New South Wales to Uruguayan parents. Porta subsequently lived in Australia before relocating to Uruguay at the age of 1 for reasons as yet unknown. He spent his youth footballing career playing with River Plate. Club career =River Plate= Porta scored a record-breaking haul of 19 goals in 15 league appearances during the 2007‚Äì2008 Primera Divisi√≥n's Torneo Apertura. He was joint leading- goal scorer of the tournament along with Danubio's Christian Stuani, establishing a new domestic record which prompted Uruguayan agent Paco Casal to buy the rights of Porta's contract for $1.1 million. In January 2008 Porta was signed to Italian club A.C. Siena. =Siena= It was reported that Porta had signed a 5-year contract with Siena for approximately ‚Ç¨3 million. On 16 March 2008 Porta debuted for Siena in a 4‚Äì0 loss to Reggina Calcio when he was substituted onto the field for Tomas Locatelli on 62 minutes. The match proved to be his only appearance in the 2007‚Äì2008 Serie A season. =Belenenses= In August 2008 Porta joined Clube de Futebol Os Belenenses for the 2008‚Äì09 Primeira Liga season. He debuted for the club on 21 September in a 2‚Äì0 loss to Sporting CP. Two weeks later Porta scored his first goal for the club in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Naval 1¬∫ de Maio on 5 October, Porta had been substituted onto the field on 87 minutes for Gabriel Enrique G√≥mez Gir√≥n and scored the equaliser for Belenenses on 90 minutes. Porta appeared in 11 games for Belenenses during the 2008‚Äì2009 season, having scored just one goal, his last appearance was on 24 May in a 3‚Äì1 loss to Benfica. Porta made four appearances for Belenenses during the 2008‚Äì09 Ta√ßa de Portugal after losing to Naval 1¬∫ de Maio in the fourth round. =River Plate= In July 2009 Porta was loaned to former club River Plate de Montevideo where he replaced striker Henry Dami√°n Gim√©nez who left for Bologna. On 13 September Porta re-debuted for River Plate, scoring on 30 minutes in a 1‚Äì1 draw to Rampla Juniors. In September Porta played in River Plate's 2009 Copa Sudamericana clash with Brazil's Vit√≥ria as River Plate won 4‚Äì1 and drew 1‚Äì1 to advance to the next round. On 18 October he scored his second league goal after 15 minutes against Atenas in a 1‚Äì0 win. On 21 October River Plate faced San Lorenzo in the next round of the Copa Sudamericana as Porta played 87 minutes of the 1‚Äì0 loss. In the second-leg Porta would score for River Plate on 46 minutes which leveled the scores on aggregate. The match was decided by a penalty shootout which River Plate won 7‚Äì6 despite Porta failing to convert his spot kick. Progressing to the semi-final stage of the Copa Sudamericana, Porta put River Plate 1‚Äì0 in front after 9 minutes against LDU Quito as his side claimed a 2‚Äì1 victory at the Estadio Centenario on 12 November. In the second-leg on 19 November River Plate would lose 7‚Äì0 to Quito in a game which Porta did not take part in. On 31 January Ported scored River Plate's second goal in a 3‚Äì3 draw to Central Espa√±ol. On 25 February Porta received his first red card in a 3‚Äì0 win to Danubio when he was substituted on to the field on 59 minutes and was red carded in the same minute. River Plate finished the 2009‚Äì2010 season in fifth spot with 23 points as Porta had scored 3 goals in 20 league matches. =Nacional= 2010‚Äì2011 season In July 2010 Porta was loaned to Club Nacional de Football for the 2010‚Äì2011 season where he made his debut on 30 August in a 3‚Äì0 loss against F√©nix at Nacional's Estadio Gran Parque Central. On 12 February he scored his first goal for Nacional in a 2‚Äì1 loss to F√©nix at the Estadio Centenario. On 16 February Porta debuted for Nacional at the 2011 Copa Libertadores in a 2‚Äì0 loss to Mexico's Club Am√©rica when he was substituted onto the field on 46 minutes for Nicol√°s Vigneri. On 13 March in a 2‚Äì0 win against Liverpool Porta was substituted onto the field on 65 minutes for Jonathan Sebasti√°n Charquero and scored Nacional's second goal one minute later. Three days later Porta was substituted onto the field for Maximiliano Calzada on 64 minutes in Nacional's 1‚Äì0 Copa Libertadores win against Argentinos Juniors. On 21 March Porta scored a double for Nacional as they beat Cerro 3‚Äì0. On 29 May Porta scored his last goal for Nacional in the 2010‚Äì2011 season after 5 minutes in a 3‚Äì0 win against Defensor. Nacional finished in first place of the 2010‚Äì2011 Torneo Clausura with 34 points, claiming a spot at the 2012 Copa Libertadores given that they had finish in third position in their respective 2011 Copa Libertadores group, behind Fluminense and Club Am√©rica. Having scored 5 goals in 19 league appearances it was reported that at one stage during 2010 Porta was a recruiting target for Sydney FC. 2011‚Äì2012 season =Loan to Al Wasl= After five games of the Torneo Apertura, in October 2011, Porta announced that he was joining Diego Maradona in his new club Al Wasl FC in Dubai, the UAE. After three months in the Emirates, he returned to Nacional as his contract with Al Wasl was terminated. Even though he missed many games while in Al Wasl, Porta ended the Campeonato Uruguayo as the highest scorer with 17 goals in 16 games, including two consecutive hattricks, against Cerrito and Bella Vista. =Dubai Club= On 11 July 2012, it was reported that Porta had rejected an offer in England in favour of a two-year multimillion-dollar contract with UAE Pro- League side Dubai Club.http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/news/1112806/Porta- heads-to-the- UAEhttp://www.unoticias.com.uy/articulos/articulos_masinfo.php?id=8483&secc;=articulos&cr;=&path;=0.284 =Independiente del Valle= On 1 August 2014, Porta signed on to play with Ecuadorian Serie A club Independiente del Valle for the remainder of the season.http://www.futbolizados.com/30410/el-uruguayo-richard-porta-es-nuevo- jugador-del-independiente-del- valle/http://www.futbolecuador.com/stories/publica/46551 =Rentistas= Upon his departure from Independiente del Valle, Porta signed with Uruguayan football clubhttp://www.futbol.com.uy/auc.aspx?261830,1107 International career In 1999 Porta was called up to a one-week training camp for the Australia U-17 team in Montevideo but was not selected for the squad that went on to claim silver medals at the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Cup in New Zealand. Porta then went on to represent the Uruguay U-20 squad at the 2003 South American Youth Championship held in Uruguay where he scored in Uruguay's 4‚Äì1 win against Bolivia on 13 January. During 2006 and 2007 Porta was twice drafted into a home-based squad for the Uruguay national team without being capped, first in March 2006 for a friendly against Saudi Arabia which was later suspended and then in September 2007 for a friendly against South Africa where he was an un-used substitute. On 21 December 2007 it was reported by The Age that Porta, despite not speaking English, had stated that if someone from Australia asked him then he would not rule out \\"wearing the green and gold\\" for the Australia national side under coach Pim Verbeek. By 16 January 2008 it was again reported by The Age that Pim Verbeek was poised to invite Porta to join the squad for Australia's 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. On 3 April 2011 it was reported that Porta, having been ignored by Australia's former coach Pim Verbeek, declared that he would consider playing for Australia should someone ask him first. Despite a chronic shortage of strikers leading up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, it was reported that Verbeek became increasingly agitated whenever questioned about Porta's claims to represent the national side when Verbeek stated that Porta never officially contacted the FFA to express his interest in playing for Australia. However, Holger Osieck looked to have re-opened the door for Porta, to prepare for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, as Osieck's staff began to monitor Porta's progress following his switch from River Plate to Nacional. Osieck considered inviting Porta to Australia's training camp in Germany during April. Having become disillusioned by his treatment from Verbeek, Porta regained enthusiasm to play for Australia as his brother, Gonzalo, who lives in Sydney stated that Porta knew Osieck was a more serious coach than Verbeek and that he definitely wanted to play for Australia hoping that his chance would come soon. On 7 November, Holger Osieck stated in an interview that the paperwork to officially enable Richard to play for Australia was underway and that clarification from The Uruguayan FA and FIFA was imminent. This should ensure El Canguro is eligible to play for the Socceroos despite the fact that he has played for the Uruguay U-20 team.http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/osieck-opens-up-on- squad-and-porta/52213 As of May 2017, Porta has yet to be capped by either the Uruguayan or Australian national teams. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Porta effectively cut ties with the Australian national team; this came after he was repeatedly stood up by the FFA, despite clearly voicing his interest in playing for Australia. Personal life Although Porta and his parents moved back to Uruguay shortly after his birth, Porta's maternal grandparents, cousins and his brother still live in Sydney. Porta declared his allegiance to Australia during the decisive 2006 FIFA World Cup CONMEBOL ‚Äì OFC qualification play-off between Australia and Uruguay when he appeared as a television studio guest in Montevideo wearing a green and gold shirt. Porta is nicknamed 'El Canguro', translating to 'Kangaroo' in Spanish. During his period in Siena he thought to take the Italian citizenship because his maternal grandfather is Italian.

His arrest in 1906 for the alleged murder of a wendigo and his suicide before trial marked the beginning of the imposition of Canadian law on the Sucker People. Until then, Fiddler's people had been among the last aboriginal peoples living in North America completely under their own law and custom.  Background  Zhauwuno- geezhigo-gaubow was born in the boreal forests of the upper Severn River near Sandy Lake, Deer Lake, and North Spirit Lake in the 1830s or 1840s. His father Peemeecheekag (Porcupine [Standing] Sideways), a mysterious figure from the east who was adopted into the Sucker clan during the previous century, was a respected political and spiritual leader. The Suckers were not the only group in the area, as they were allied with the Pelican and Sturgeon clans, and had contact with the Cranes as well. The clans spoke a unique form of the Oji-Cree dialect of the Anishinaabe language and had contact with the Ojibwa at Lake Winnipeg and the Oji-Cree farther to the north and east. Zhauwuno-geezhigo- gaubow grew up during a period of difficulty. Over-trapping for the fur trade of the previous centuries had left the boreal forests of Northern Ontario depleted of animals. With declining numbers of furs, lower demand abroad, and more opportunities in the west, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) abandoned their post at Island Lake for much of the early 19th century, forcing the Suckers to travel to Big Trout Lake or Little Grand Rapids for trade. As a young man, Zhauwuno-geezhigo-gaubow likely worked on the York boats bringing furs to York Factory. By the 1860s, the number of fur-bearing animals increased enough for the HBC to re-open the Island Lake post, and Zhauwuno-geezhigo-gaubow emerged as one of the leaders of the Sucker people. At his brief visits at the posts, he developed the ability to fiddle and built quality instruments. HBC traders frequently gave English nicknames to individual Natives and designated whole clans by the name of a primary leader or an arbitrary English surname. Thus, the Sturgeons were known to traders (and later Canadian authorities) by the surname Rae or Mamakeesick, the Pelicans after their leader Meekis, and the Cranes after their leaders Kakegamic and Kakepetum. Zhauwuno-geezhigo-gaubow and his brother Pesequan became Jack and Joseph Fiddler, and the Suckers often appear in the records as the Fiddler tribe. Jack Fiddler took five wives: Kakakwesic, Nakwasasive, Nocome, Kaopasanakitiyat, and Kayakatopicicikec and had 13 children. Polygamy was common, out of necessity if for no other reason, as young men died often in the dangers of the times.  The wendigo  Like his father before him, Jack Fiddler became a famous shaman for his alleged ability to conjure animals and protect his people from spells. Most importantly to the people of the region, he could allegedly successfully defeat the wendigo, a cannibalistic spirit that would possess people during all-too-frequent bouts of famine and disease. In his life, Jack Fiddler claimed to have defeated fourteen wendigos. Apparently some were sent against his people by enemy shamans, and others were members of his own band who were taken with an insatiable, incurable desire to eat human flesh. In the latter case, Fiddler was usually asked by family members to kill a very sick loved one before they turned wendigo. In some cases, the \\"Wendigo\\" him or herself would ask to be euthanized according to the necessary rites. Fiddler's own brother, Peter Flett, was killed after turning wendigo when the food ran out on a trading expedition. HBC traders and Cree and missionaries were well aware of the Wendigo legend, though they often explained it as mental illness or superstition. Regardless, several incidents of people turning wendigo and eating human flesh are documented in the records of the company. Jack Fiddler's reputation also grew among these groups, and he was approached multiple times by Cree ministers at Island Lake and asked to bring Christianity to his people. Though he respectfully heard their requests, Fiddler did not convert. By the beginning of the 20th century, the Sucker people were among the only Indigenous people in North America living in a traditional manner with almost no government imposition on legal and religious matters.  Arrest and trial  In early 1907, two members of the North-West Mounted Police visiting Island Lake heard of Jack Fiddler's power against the wendigo from Norman Rae, an in-law of the Fiddlers. Seeking to introduce Canadian law in the North, the Mounties went to the Sucker camp at Deer Lake and arrested Jack and Joseph Fiddler for murder. Before leaving, they took an eyewitness and declared that each man must give up any extra wives. For most of the Sucker people, the Mounties were the first whites they had ever seen. The elderly brothers were charged with murdering Wahsakapeequay, Joseph's daughter-in-law, the year before. They were held at Norway House to await trial. Meanwhile, newspapers across Canada picked up the story and printed sensational headlines of murder and devil-worship. Across the country, people demanded convictions, while the police conducting the trial saw an opportunity for fame and advancement. On September 30, Jack Fiddler escaped captivity during a walk outside. He hanged himself nearby and was found dead later in the day. Robert Fiddler, son of Jack Fiddler and successor as chief of the Sucker people Joseph Fiddler still went to trial, however. Angus Rae, the eyewitness, testified that Wahsakapeequay was killed while in deep pain and incurably sick according to the custom of the people who were not aware of Canadian law. Pressed on the wendigo issue, Rae admitted that it was a belief among his people and that Jack and Joseph were the ones who were usually asked to euthanize the very sick and prevent wendigos. Despite some other unreliable testimony from Rae, and the pleas of missionaries and HBC traders, Joseph was convicted and sentenced to death by Aylesworth Perry, the stipendary magistrate.John Marlowe 'The Flesh-Hungry Wendigo' in 'Canadian Mysteries of the Unexplained' (London: Arcturus 2009) Further appeals secured his release, but the order came three days after his death in 1909.  Aftermath  Without their most prominent leaders, the people of the upper Severn River had no choice but to accept government rule. Robert Fiddler, Jack's son, signed an addition to Treaty 5 as \\"chief of the Deer Lake Band\\" in 1910 and chose to settle at Deer Lake. Later, several families including the Fiddlers, moved to Sandy Lake and became part of Treaty 9. Today, most of the descendants of Jack Fiddler live in the Sandy Lake First Nation with others at the Deer Lake First Nation, and North Spirit Lake First Nation in Ontario, and the three reserves at Island Lake in Manitoba.

It is the first private observatory in the United States to open in the 20th century.  History  MIRA was founded in 1972. The acronym \\"MIRA\\" was chosen because of the unusual star of that name and the reference to the astronomical-relevant Spanish word for ‚Äòlook‚Äô. The idea for an independent observatory came from Bruce Weaver and Craig Chester, then astronomy graduate students at Warner and Swasey Observatory, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio; the other founders were Donna Burych, Cynthia Irvine, Nelson Irvine, Albert Merville, Anne Merville, Hazel Ross, and Sandra Weaver. The group of \\"nearly penniless and doomed graduate students\\" were concerned how they would manage to work in astronomy. According to MIRA astronomer Arthur Babcock, during the early 1970s as \\"the glory days of space exploration were winding down\\" scientists decided they wanted a place where they could do long range research without the \\"demanding cycle of academia\\" and constant publishing. As observational stellar astronomers, they needed constant access to a large telescope. Working at the Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona was a possibility but opening their own observatory was even better, it started off as a joke but over time and in discussion with the other close-knit students it became serious contemplation. A meeting at a lecture with astronomer Bart Bok, who was very enthusiastic about the idea, encouraged the students. With Bok's influence and word-of- mouth, the Case students began to lecture at other campuses. During one lecture at the University of Maryland they \\"heard of a 36-inch mirror that was gathering dust at Princeton. It had been built by NASA as the backup for Stratoscope II ... and never used\\". Carl Sagan suggested that the Case students be invited to give a talk at the American Astronomical Society, where Weaver found Martin Schwarzschild who was then director of the Princeton Observatory, \\"eating breakfast alone and sat down with him\\"; this was an event known as '\\"the famous breakfast meeting\\"'. That discussion led to Princeton \\"indefinitely\\" loaning the mirror to the Case students. Because the Case students had now gained access to the mirror and had received pledges from the other students, and because they were not tied to any specific institution, they only needed to find the location. They knew that mountain ranges \\"along the west coast of a continent\\" where the air was smooth from the ocean, \\"resulted in small sharp star images\\". This knowledge led the students to eventually select the Santa Lucia Range. Lick Observatory astronomers had been interested in a new observing station in that area. Students Albert and Ann Merville were sent to investigate locations, and they selected Chews Ridge which had an elevation of . A dirt road and a fire tower nearby were other considerations in favor of the location. In 1972, the astronomers applied to the Forest Service for a use permit, and it was granted in 1974. Over the next couple of years, the Case students moved to Monterey County, and took part- time jobs in the area, in order to make a down-payment on in Cachagua Valley, near the Carmel foothills. Bruce Weaver recounts that the formation of Friends of MIRA happened in September 1978 \\"when 80 people assembled in Ansel Adams' house.\\" The influence of Bok and the nearness of Lick Observatory allowed MIRA to \\"receive a $76,000 grant from the Research Corporation ... to build a telescope around the 36-inch mirror\\". In 1975, as a training exercise, the Army Engineers finished the last half mile to the observatory. Bok and his wife ‚Äî astronomer Priscilla ‚Äî donated \\"their entire collection of journals and books\\". The library later received a \\"van full of professional journals\\" from astronomer Art Hoag. The 5-year mission of MIRA in its beginning was to do a \\"spectral and photometric study of the brightest 125,000 stars in the northern sky\\", which was meant to \\"yield the data base for a generation of astronomers\\". The group decided that they would focus on the \\"'nonglamour area in astronomy'\\" ‚Äî stars in our own galaxy. Studying how stars form and die as well as categorizing stars, \\"statistical studies and composition and properties of T Tauri stars ... and N-type Carbon stars. MIRA astronomer Nelson Irvine states \\"that is not the most glamorous area '... that means there's more chance to do important work'\\". When the observatory opened its doors officially in 1982, it was the first private observatory to open in the United States in the 20th century.  Facilities  MIRA's facilities are divided between its in-town offices and shops. They are located near the southern border of the city of Marina, and the northern edge of CSU Monterey Bay, and its research observatory is in the remote Los Padres National Forest, roughly half-way between the unincorporated settlement of Jamesburg and the Tassajara Zen monastery. Weaver Student Observatory is at: . MIRA's campus is contiguous with the campus of the California State University, Monterey Bay, but MIRA is independent from any parent institution, and not affiliated with the university. The Marina campus consists of the following: * The Richard Hamming Astronomy Center, which contains the offices and the Priscilla Bok library * The Ralph Knox Shops, which contains the mechanical, electrical, and optical shops * The Elma Ross Library * The Bette M. and William R. Weaver Student Observatory (WSO), which houses a computer-controlled 14 inch Schmidt- Cassegrain telescope for public and student use  Observatory  : The MIRA Bernard M. Oliver Observing Station in winter/ The MIRA research observatory is the Bernard M. Oliver Observing Station, and is located on Chews Ridge in the Los Padres National Forest at . Scientist Bernard Oliver gave the '\\"gift of a lifetime\\"' which was a quarter of the costs for construction of the Chews Ridge observatory. Chews Ridge was chosen for its cool weather and \\"steady airflow off the cold Pacific Ocean\\" giving astronomers \\"clear nights and sharp images\\". Also, the mountains block light pollution from the city of Greenfield allowing for \\"pitch-black conditions\\". The observatory has a full-time live in caretaker year-round. The building was designed by amateur astronomer, architect Lawrence Bernstein. Described as looking more like a \\"ski chalet than an observatory\\" the building was designed to allow for the best viewing conditions. There is a roll-off roof, to avoid turbulence, and the building is set on a hollow pier to avoid air currents that might affect the telescope. A separate control room for the operator is located north of the telescope. The Chews Ridge area is littered with gun shells, so the designers felt it was important that the building be bullet-proof, and have angled windows to prevent a direct view of the inside. In preparation for fire, the walls are filled with gravel; if the outer wall burns, then gravel will be released to smother the flames. The observatory houses a computer-controlled 36 inch Cassegrain telescope equipped with Spectrographs and direct cameras. The observatory is mostly self-sufficient with generators, batteries and solar panels. \\"A 16,000-gallon-tank collects rainwater, doing double duty by also helping to stabilize the telescope.\\" Power comes from a windmill on the ridge. The Oliver station is one of the few that does not use a dome with a slit to look through, the whole roof slides back to expose the room. This avoids the problem of turbulence that the wind can cause when using a retracted dome.

The game designer dropped the 1950s postmodern stylistic influences and references for a more 1970's B-Movie apocalyptic science-fiction feel, with a large dose of parodies, past and present. = GCG vs. Interplay Lawsuit = Glutton Creeper filed legal action against Interplay in late 2007 on the Fallout license for breach of contract after Bethesda served a cease and desist notice on the development of a pen and paper RPG in the Fallout universe. Bethesda attempted to attach itself on the lawsuit but they were dismissed from the suit. Glutton and Interplay settled out of court in April 2009 for an undisclosed amount. Glutton Creeper sought judgement against Interplay for failure to meet the terms of the settlement agreement between the two companies. Interplay breached the first part of the terms in May 2010 by failing to comply with those terms. The second part of the terms to remain in effect until December 2012 became null. In March 2013 GCG won a judgment claim against Interplay. Interplay has stated they will appeal but they failed to file an appeal within the set timeframe. As of September 2013 Interplay has failed to pay the adjusted judgment. = GCG Shutdown = In August 2014 GCG was acquired by 4 Hour Games.  Exodus setting  Exodus is set in southwest United States in the year 2042. The storyline of Exodus encompass an alternative history of 20th century from 1939 to 2012, which is the year of nuclear war's outbreak. In December 2012, on the winter solstice, a date prophesied by the Maya as the end of evolution, a date prophesied by Nostradamus as World's End, man chose to evolve by the process of natural selection through self extermination from nuclear fallout. The decade long War on Terror escalated to a series of short events between many warring nations that ravaged the known world on all sides in 24 short hours forcing man into an Exodus that would last 20 years for the chosen survivors, before they could return to the ruins of civilization and start a new era of man. The survivors are the lucky ones, the people that made it to fallout shelters, and those that somehow survived against all odds. Exodus is fully supported by a line of OPS (Organized Playable Scenarios) adventures, which most are free or are available for a price through the Glutton Creeper online store. All of these adventures take place in the Southwest United States, and are designed to play for roughly 4 hours of time.

It is taken from the Octopus album of 1995. \\"Filling Up with Heaven\\" was the third and final single to be taken from the Octopus album. It was jointly written by lead singer Philip Oakey and Producer Ian Stanley (formerly of Tears for Fears). It was released on 5 June 1995 in a variety of vinyl and CD single formats. These included various third-party remixes of \\"Filling Up With Heaven\\" and \\"John Cleese: is he Funny?\\", including mixes by Hardfloor. After the success of the previous two singles it was expected to equal the chart position of Tell Me When and One Man in My Heart. But unlike the two previous singles it was not play listed by BBC Radio 1 and received minimal national airplay, affecting sales. The single eventually peaked at number 36 in the UK singles chart, spending a total of two weeks in the charts.Human League Bio 1990-1999 > Music video Screenshot of Susan Ann Sulley in music video for \\"Filling up with Heaven\\" 1995 The music video for \\"Filling Up with Heaven\\" was filmed on a low budget and in a minimalist studio (London's Limehouse Studios), unlike the other music videos for Octopus which were higher end. With rich saturated background colours. It features a series of sweeping steadicam shots of Philip Oakey, with a mainly seated Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall. It is the only one of the Human League‚Äôs music videos which Susan Ann Sulley has a long blonde pony tail hairstyle, for the previous two she has short hair, suggesting that she had hair extensions for the video. For the instrumental sections a continual sweeping loop of Neil Sutton playing keyboards is featured. Post production the video was intentionally stylized by deeply enriching the colours and reducing the pixel resolution, giving a digital smudge effect (as illustrated). A licensing fee dispute between EastWest and Virgin Records would prevent the video from being featured on the 2003 Very Best of The Human League DVD. However, in 2016, a remastered version of the video was featured on a DVD included with the deluxe version of the box set A Very British Synthesizer Group.

A theory for the emergence of modern South Africa His major work, The Emergence of Modern South Africa: State, Capital, and the Incorporation of Organized Labour on the South African Gold Fields, 1902-1939, published in 1983, examined the labour movement in South Africa and takes into account aspects of Marxism and nationalism and applies it to the country. He examined the history of labour in the South African Gold Fields in the first half of the 20th century, combining philosophy and economic theory to understand this process. One important argument was the uncovering of the English roots of Apartheid in South Africa, moving its origins back from the National Party's victory in 1948. In it he christened Frederick Johnstone, Harold Wolpe and Martin Legassick as ‚Äòelder statesmen‚Äô of ‚Äòthe new school' and criticized their work. It remains the standard in its field as a point of departure for theories about the emergence of Modern South Africa. Hermann Giliomee referred to this work in his book The Afrikaners. \\"David Yudelman concluded in his study of the relationship between state, capital, and white labor in the 1920s, continuity in government policies before and after J. C. Smuts‚Äô South African Party (SAP) government was defeated by a coalition led by General J. B. M. Hertzog‚Äôs National Party in 1924 generally overshadowed the important differences between the two governments.[10] However, in applying a similar argument to 1948, it is not suggested here that the policy differences before and after 1948 were inconsequential.\\" Canada On arrival in Canada he dedicated himself to work on economics. He began in banking and also wrote speeches for Matt Barrett and Bill Mulholland, bank chairmen, and for various Ontario ministers.http://www.ontla.on.ca/committee- proceedings/transcripts/files_html/2004-08-19_F025.htm Subsequently, he was a consultant on the Toronto Stock Exchange. He published a work entitled The Scorpion and the Frog: A Consumer View of Canadian Financial Services and Ways to Transform Them in 2001. Yudelman was critical of the financial services industry's ability to regulate itself in the 150-page report which was funded by the federal government. He felt that at stake were the retirement savings of millions of Canadians, who had made a massive shift of assets from safe traditional savings vehicles to more volatile investments tied to the stock market.https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jrpoli/v12y1986i2p152-153.html as retrieved on 25 Jun 2007 01:10:57 GMT. On Thursday 19 August 2004 Yudelman testified before the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs in Canada. His presentation focused on the overall relationship between consumers and financial services. His son Jonathan Yudelman is also an author who has been published in Azure and resides in Israel.

He wrote mainly about the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and Royal Air Force (RAF) operations in the First and Second World Wars, and about cricket. Life and career He was educated at Hounslow College, and on leaving school joined the Sporting Life in 1934. Subsequently, he went into banking. He had started writing, and several of his sketches were used in West End revues.Obituary of Ralph Barker, The Daily Telegraph, 20 June 2011. Following the outbreak of World War II, in 1940 he joined the RAF as a wireless operator and air gunner. He flew with Nos. 47 and 39 squadrons on torpedo missions against Axis ships bringing supplies to Rommel's forces in the Western Desert in North Africa. These missions, from bases in Malta and North Africa, led to heavy losses amongst the Bristol Beaufort aircraft carrying them out. Barker's time in this theatre of war was ended by a crash in which his pilot and navigator died. He returned to Britain, and switched to flying transport aircraft. He completed two thousand flying hours before he was demobilised in 1946. He briefly went back to banking, before going into civil aviation as a radio operator. At the end of 1948, he rejoined the RAF and went to Germany as a public relations officer in connection with the Berlin Airlift. He spent two years in service broadcasting at BFN Hamburg. He was then posted to the Air Ministry to work on official war narratives. His first book, Down in the Drink, was published in 1955, the first of many on the subject of military aviation. Barker left the RAF in 1961 to write full-time. He was a frequent contributor of feature articles to the Sunday Express. He turned to cricket writing in 1964, with Ten Great Innings. John Arlott, reviewing Ten Great Bowlers, its follow-up, described Barker as \\"a master of the reconstruction of past cricket matches\\". His most substantial book on cricket is a history of Tests between England and Australia, published in 1969, which included a report of every match and a summary of each series. The statistics were provided by Irving Rosenwater. The cricket historian David Frith said that his most significant contribution to cricket might have been his research into the death in 1912 of the former England fast bowler Tom Richardson, which proved that the rumours that he had committed suicide were untrue.Wisden Obituaries ‚Äì 2011: BARKER, RALPH HAMMOND CECIL, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2012 edition. Retrieved 22 September 2016 Barker played regularly for the RAF's cricket club, the Adastrians, and subsequently for several clubs in Surrey, including West Surrey, whom he captained for a number of years. Barker was married to performer Diana Darvey from 1995 until her death on 11 April 2000. Barker died on 16 May 2011, aged 93.

The station was assigned the KGEO call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on May 18, 1981. KWAC (AM) operates from KGEO's transmitter site and uses its tower. History The station signed on in 1945 as KERO. At that time, it broadcast from the El Tejon hotel in Downtown Bakersfield. In 1953, it spawned Bakersfield's second television station, which still bears the KERO-TV calls. Original local owner Kern County Broadcasters sold off the radio station in 1955, and the call letters were changed to KGEE. It supported a mix of talk and popular music. Its moniker was \\"KGEE, the talk of the town\\". In 1981, it changed the call letters to KGEO, and became one of Bakersfield's first stations to program an \\"oldies\\" format, consisting of music from 1954 to current. The station was known as \\"KGEOldies\\". During the 1980s, it advertised itself as playing 4 decades of hits. It switched to an all talk format in the late 1990s. At that point KGEO experimented with \\"hot talk\\" carrying such syndicated programs as the \\"Phil Hendrie Show\\" and \\"the Tom Leykis Show\\". Until 2006, KGEO was an all-sports station and carried an extensive lineup from ESPN Radio. KGEO is no longer the flagship station for the Bakersfield Blaze of the California League of Minor League Baseball and the Bakersfield Condors in the ECHL.

History  Bhawal National Park was established and maintained as a National Park in 1974; it was officially declared in 1982 under the Wildlife Act of 1974. By origin, it was the forest of Madhupur under the rule of Bhawal Estate. It is located in Gazipur, Dhaka Division of Bangladesh, approximately 40 km north of Dhaka city, only 20 km drive from Gazipur and 20 km from Kapasia. The core area of the park covers 940 hectares but extends to 5,022 ha of surrounding forest. Its purpose is to protect important habitats as well as to provide opportunities for recreation. It has been kept under IUCN Management Category V, as a protected landscape. The most common flora is the unique coppice sal forest. The area was noted for peacocks, tiger, leopard, black panther, elephant, clouded leopard and sambar deer. However much of the wildlife had disappeared and only a few species remain. Also, most of the forest has been denuded and is now occupied by forestry companies or displaced people. Most of this area was covered by forests fifty years ago and the dominant species was Sal (Shorea robusta). Illegal deforestation has left only 600 km¬≤ of the forest and new trees and woodlands have been planted.  Ecology  The park has 345 plant species, including 152 different tree species, 53 shrubs, 106 herbs and 34 climber species. The wildlife in the park includes 13 mammals, 9 reptiles, 5 birds and 5 amphibians. In addition the Forest Department has recently introduced peacocks, deers, pythons, and cat fish.

Henry Sargent's father was a prosperous and public- spirited merchant. Henry was sent as a young boy to Dummer Academy, South Byfield, and then, the family having moved to Boston, he continued his studies under local teachers. After a period in the counting house of Thomas Handasyd Perkins, he continued his commercial apprenticeship with his father, but suddenly, as he was attaining his majority, without having previously shown special partiality for the arts of design, he determined to become an artist. An elder brother's efforts in this direction seem to have stimulated him, and his mother encouraged him. John Trumbull, who visited Boston in 1790, saw some of his work and found it promising. Career In 1793, Sargent went to London, where he studied with Benjamin West and had courteous treatment from John Singleton Copley. A letter of Sargent's dated March 27, 1795Julia DeWolf Addison, \\"Henry Sargent: A Boston Painter,\\" Art in America, vol. 17 (October, 1929), p. 279. shows that he found living in London expensive and the painter's profession much depressed. He returned to Boston in 1799, still strongly conscious of \\"the apathy then existing towards the arts\\".Dunlap, William. A History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States, vol. II, p. 192. Ed. F. W. Bayley and C. E. Goodspeed, 1918. =Public service= After his return to Boston in 1799, he took a commission in the national army then being raised under the command of Alexander Hamilton. This service was brief, but it gave Sargent a taste for military life which motivated his long connection with the Massachusetts militia. In or shortly after 1799, he joined the Boston Light Infantry, which had been organized the year before and of which his brother, Daniel Sargent, was captain. Records of the adjutant-general's office in the Massachusetts State House show that Henry Sargent became first lieutenant of this company on October 1, 1804, and captain on March 31, 1807. Of a tall, thin, Yankee build, he was a handsome officer and an efficient drill master. During the War of 1812, his company aided in the fortification of Fort Strong, and on May 31, 1815, he was appointed aide-de-camp to the governor, with the rank of Colonel. In 1812, 1815, 1816, and 1817 he was a member of the Massachusetts Senate. =Later career= In the course of the following decade, growing deafness caused him gradually to withdraw from public services and to devote himself entirely to his painting and to mechanical inventions. He developed a plan for an elevated railway, but his inventions gained him no particular fame. His painting was that of a diligent and gifted artist whose talent fell short of genius. His portraits were less masterful than those of his fellow townsman, Gilbert Stuart, with whom he was personally intimate. Like Copley, whom he somewhat resembled as a painter, Sargent enjoyed intensive elaboration of textures and accessories. He had a capacity for doing canvases that required sustained effort. The well-known Landing of the Pilgrims, at Pilgrim Hall, Plymouth, attributed to him,In 1820 Sargent's Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers of Plymouth in 1620 appeared on exhibit in Boston \\"in the building lately erected in the N.W. corner of Dock Square and in the rear of the Brattle Street meeting house;\\" cf. The Repertory; Date: 09-07-1820 is not representative of his best work. Far better are the two conversation pieces, The Dinner Party (ca. 1821) and The Tea Party (ca. 1824), owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. These have something of the exquisiteness of the so- called Little Dutchmen and they give fascinating glimpses of social life in Boston homes of the early 19th century. An altar painting, The Christ Crucified, which Sargent made for the Holy Cross Church, Boston, won contemporary favor. The full-length portrait of Peter Faneuil, in Faneuil Hall, if by Sargent, to whom it is ascribed, must be a copy after John Smibert.Dunlap, vol. II, p. 196. Sargent's self-portrait is at the Museum of Fine Arts; his likenesses of Jeremy Belknap, D.D., and John Clarke, D.D., both friends of his parents, are at the Massachusetts Historical Society. Continuing to paint at intervals down into old age, he was elected in 1840 an honorary member of the National Academy of Design and in 1845, president of the newly organized Boston Artists' Association. Personal life On April 2, 1807, Sargent married Hannah Welles (1779‚Äì1841), the daughter of Samuel and Isabella (n√©e Pratt) Welles, of Boston. Together, they had two daughters who died in infancy and two sons: * Henry Winthrop Sargent (1810‚Äì1882), who married Caroline Olmsted. * John Turner Welles Sargent (1814‚Äì1877), who married Amelia Jackson Holmes (1843‚Äì1889), only daughter of Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., and Harriet Lydia Boardman Parker (1830‚Äì1868) Sargent died on February 21, 1845.

As an actor, he is probably best known for his role as Dr. Stanley Riverside II on the television series Trapper John, M.D. which he portrayed from 1979 to 1986. Although he still occasionally works as an actor, after 1986 Siebert's career has focused on working as a director for episodic television for such shows as Xena: Warrior Princess, and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. Biography Siebert studied acting at Marquette University under legendary teacher Fr. John J. Walsh, S.J. and later at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). He began his career appearing in regional theatre productions throughout the United States during the 1960s with such companies as Shakespeare in the Park in New York City, the Lincoln Center Repertory Company, the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut, the Guthrie Theater, the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, Chicago's Goodman Theatre, and Baltimore's Center Stage. He spent seven summers at the Williamstown Theatre Festival and is a charter member of the American Conservatory Theater. He made his Broadway debut in 1967 in Bertolt Brecht's Life of Galileo followed by the role of Michael Leon in John Sebastian and Murray Schisgal's 1968 musical Jimmy Shine with Dustin Hoffman in the title role. Subsequent Broadway appearances included Neil Simon's The Gingerbread Lady, with Maureen Stapleton, David Storey's The Changing Room, David Rabe's Sticks and Bones, and the 1974 revival of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof starring Elizabeth Ashley, Fred Gwynne, and Keir Dullea. Notable Off-Broadway appearances include Colette starring Zoe Caldwell, and Rubbers directed by Alan Arkin. Siebert began appearing regularly on New York television during the late 1960s and early 1970s, mostly in soap operas like Another World, As the World Turns, Search for Tomorrow, The Nurses, and One Life to Live. Moving to Los Angeles in 1976 Siebert made his first feature film appearance in the horror cult classic Blue Sunshine. He then began appearing as a guest artist on numerous television programs such as One Day at a Time, The Blue Knight, The Rockford Files, and Mancuso, F.B.I. starring Robert Loggia. Also, he was a regular on the comedy program Husbands, Wives & Lovers. In 1987, he was cast alongside Hayley Mills as her husband on the NBC pilot Good Morning, Miss Bliss; however, NBC passed on the program and it was then picked up by the Disney Channel, which made numerous casting changes including dropping Siebert's role. The program would evolve into the Saturday morning hit Saved by the Bell. Film roles throughout the mid to late 1970s included ...And Justice for All with Al Pacino, Michael Crichton's Coma, All Night Long with Barbra Streisand and Gene Hackman, and White Water Summer with Sean Astin and Kevin Bacon. In 1979 Siebert was cast in his most important role to date, Dr. Stanley Riverside II, on Trapper John, M.D. where he also began his directing career. He played a major supporting role as the mayor of Los Angeles, Frank Baldwin, in the 1990 television miniseries The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake, a disaster thriller. Siebert was a regular on game shows in the 80s, appearing on $25,000 Pyramid, $100,000 Pyramid, Match Game, Super Password (in which he appeared with Jo Ann Worley, Vicki Lawrence, Jackee Harry, Edie McClurg, Patricia Klous, and Bert Convy), and Blackout. His directing career, which began with seven episodes of Trapper John, M.D., eventually resulted in numerous episodes of Xena, Warrior Princess, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Silk Stalkings, Renegade, Pacific Blue, and Vanishing Son, as well as episodes of Knots Landing, The Pretender, Lifestories, Palace Guard and Jack's Place.

It has the distinction of being the first Spanish aircraft to harness jet propulsion. The German aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt can be largely credited for his role in designing the HA-200, which reused a substantial portion of the earlier piston-powered HA-100 Triana. On 12 August 1955, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. It was not until 1962 that the first production aircraft performed its first flight. That same year, deliveries of the trainer aircraft commenced to the Spanish Air Force. It would be used in this capacity by the service for multiple decades. The HA-200 was later further developed into the Hispano Aviaci√≥n Ha-220 \\"Super Saeta\\", which functioned as a dedicated ground attack platform, armed with rockets, bombs, and other munitions. The HA-220 served in the Spanish Air Force throughout the 1970s, seeing action during the Polisario uprisings against insurgents. The HA-200 was also exported, the type being produced under license by Egypt, where it was designated as the Helwan HA-200B Al-Kahira. During the 1980s, the more capable CASA C-101 was introduced to Spanish service, supplementing and eventually succeeding the older HA-200 in both trainer and light attack roles. Development =Background= The origins of the HA-200 Saeta are heavily intertwined with the German aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt, who was responsible for producing a significant proportion of its design. Following the end of the Second World War, Messerschmitt emigrated from Germany and begun offering his services to various other nations, including South Africa. During 1951, he had settled in Francoist Spain and shortly thereafter begun to design aircraft for the government in conjunction with local aircraft manufacturer Hispano Aviaci√≥n. During the early 1950s, Messerschmitt worked on the HA-100 Triana, a piston- powered prototype trainer aircraft; while never attaining production, this design would subsequently serve as the basis for the HA-200. In fact, the two aircraft directly shared many design features, including the wing, tail unit, and tricycle undercarriage; original elements were largely confined to the area forward of the cockpit.Forsgren 2017, p. 25. As early as 1951, Messerschmitt had promoted the idea of Spain developing its independent aviation industry, as well as suggesting the pursuit of both an indigenous jet fighter and jet engine. Throughout the 1950s, progress on the HA-200 programme was supervised by Messerschmitt from Hispano's office in Seville.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 342. It would be Spain's first indigenously- developed aircraft to be powered by the turbojet engine. On 12 August 1955, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, flown by Major Fernando de Juan Valiente, the company's chief test pilot. Valiente later praised the prototype's handling qualities, stating them to be light and responsive, including \\"viceless and straightforward\\" stall characteristics.Lambert 3 February 1956, p. 131. Early on, the French Turbomeca Marbor√© turbojet engine had been selected to power the type; Spain had successfully negotiated a license to locally produce this engine.\\"Military Aircraft of the World...\\" Flight International, 20 June 1958. p. 862. Development was protracted, the first production aircraft, which was designated by the manufacturer as HA-200A, first flew during October 1962. Shortly thereafter, the initial version of the aircraft were delivered to the Spanish Air Force; in service, it was operated under the service designation E.14. =Further development= The initial trainer model of the aircraft was shortly followed on by a single- seat version, designated as the HA-220, which was designed to perform ground attack missions. On 25 April 1970, this new model made its first flight. During the early 1970s, the ground attack-orientated HA-220 entered into service with the Spanish Air Force, which designated the type as C.10. It remained in service for barely a decade, all of the C.20s being withdrawn from Spanish service by the end of 1981. During the late 1950s, the emerging HA-200 had drawn the attention of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser;Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 339. around this time, Nasser was passionate on the subject of developing Egyptian industrial and military capabilities alike, which included the domestic production of modern jet aircraft. Negotiations between Spain and Egypt were facilitated by Messerschmitt, who acted as a key go-between for the two parties. During 1959, an arrangement was reached that led to the HA-200 being produced under license in Egypt at the Helwan Air Works. Hispano provided documentation pertaining to the aircraft's design and manufacture to support these efforts. Both the airframe and the engines were locally manufactured.\\"Egypt: development spearhead.\\" Flight International, 13 March 1975. p. 417. According to aerospace periodical Flight International, a total of 65 HA-200s were reportedly constructed at Helwan between 1960 and 1969.\\"Saudia Arabia axes Egypt's aerospace plans.\\" Flight International, 26 May 1979. p. 1716. In Egyptian Air Force service, the type was commonly referred to as the Helwan HA-200B Al-Kahira.\\"UAR Fighters.\\" Flight International, 11 April 1963. pp. 488-489. According to Flight International, during the early 1960s, Egypt and Spain were collaborating on the development of a six-seater business jet directly derived from the HA-200. Around this time, the two nations jointly worked on various aviation projects, including the Helwan HA-300, a cancelled supersonic fighter aircraft. Design Close- up view of the nose intake The HA-200 Saeta is a jet-powered trainer aircraft. In terms of its configuration, it is a low-winged monoplane, featuring all- metal construction and a retractable tricycle undercarriage arrangement. Structurally, it was relatively conventional for the era, using semi-monocoque lightweight alloy construction. The cockpit of the HA-200 accommodated a crew of two in a tandem seating configuration; however, the ground-attack orientated HA-220 was furnished with a single-seat cockpit instead. For greater crew comfort, this cockpit was pressurised, the HA-200 being the first Spanish aircraft to possess this facility. The HA-200's propulsion consisted of a pair of Turbomeca Marbor√© turbojet engines, which were installed in a side-by-side arrangement inside the forward fuselage and mounted on a stressed-skin structure that forms the outer surface of the fuselage's underside. Air was fed to the engines via a large intake on the front of the nose; this particular intake arrangement has been described as being unique amongst jet aircraft.\\"Hispano HA-200 Cairo.\\" Smithsonian, Retrieved: 20 August 2019. The engine's exhaust nozzles were located upon the lower fuselage, just aft of the trailing edge of the wing.Lambert 3 February 1956, pp. 131-132. A maximum of 261 gallons of fuel could be carried across a pair of fuselage tanks, two wing tanks and two permanently-attached tip tanks; provisions were made for jettisoning fuel in emergency situations.Lambert 3 February 1956, p. 132. For weapons training purposes, the HA-200 featured provisions for the carriage of armaments. Operational history In 1970, the HA-200 replaced the aging CASA 2.111 (a Spanish development of the Heinkel He 111) in Escuadr√≥n 462 on the Canary Islands. From there, they frequently flew on detachments to Spanish Sahara. Late in 1974, during the Polisario uprisings, the HA-200 conducted its first combat missions against the Polisario Front. In one instance, guerillas ambushed a police patrol from higher ground and caves, keeping them pinned from their protected positions. In response, several T-6D fighters and UH-1 helicopters strafed the Polisario positions with machine gun fire, but had little effect; additional air strikes by a pair of Saetas, armed with 2.75\\" FFARs, were more successful. Diving at a 45 degree angle at the cave entrances, the HA-200's qualities proved itself most suitable for the role. Following these rocket attacks, ground troops attempted to take the caves but were pushed back. The next morning, the Saetas returned to perform more air strikes in the company of more T-6s and UH-1 troop carriers. The attack pattern was repeated with success again, aided by a Forward Air Controller that directed ground fire to where it would be most effective. Multiple rockets entered the caves through the 5‚Äì10 foot entrances, few reported missed their target. It is believed that one of the rockets set off some stored mortar rounds, as there were several large explosions. Afterwards, ground troops advanced upon the caves again, this time facing hardly any resistance as most of the guerillas had been killed by the rockets from the Saetas.

The bridge is long and above the river. Construction work began on July 5, 1906 and it was ready for service on May 8, 1908. At the time it was the longest bridge for its height in the world. It currently remains one of the longest and highest single track railroad viaducts in the United States, and was designated as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2005. The Northern Pacific Railroad designed and built the bridge to avoid the steep grades into and out of the Sheyenne River valley. At one time, this was a main link in the railroad's coast-to-coast system and was important during both World Wars. To prevent sabotage during the wars, it was guarded by soldiers. The bridge is still used today by freight trains in the BNSF Railway system. The 61 spans of the bridge are supported on 30 steel towers, each of which is 45 feet long at the top. The distance between towers at their tops is either 60, 75, or, for three of the spans, 101 feet. Two of these long spans are above the Sheyenne River and the third crosses over tracks of the former Soo Line Railroad, now part of the Canadian Pacific Railroad. Each of the steel towers is supported on four concrete foundation piers measuring 6 feet square at their tops, and expanding to 14 to 18 feet square at their bases, depending on subsurface conditions. Approximately one million rivets were used in construction of the bridge.Barnes County Historical Society, public information kiosk, Chautauqua Park, Valley City, North Dakota.

Commentators have often grouped it with Blood Wedding and Yerma as a \\"rural trilogy\\". Lorca did not include it in his plan for a \\"trilogy of the Spanish land\\" (which remained unfinished at the time of his murder).Maurer, Christopher. (1992). Introduction. Three Plays. By Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. Trans. Michael Dewell and Carmen Zapata. London: Penguin. p. ix . Lorca described the play in its subtitle as a drama of women in the villages of Spain. The House of Bernarda Alba was Lorca's last play, completed on 19 June 1936, two months before Lorca's death during the Spanish Civil War. The play was first performed on 8 March 1945 at the Avenida Theatre in Buenos Aires. The play centers on the events of a house in Andalusia during a period of mourning, in which Bernarda Alba (aged 60) wields total control over her five daughters Angustias (39 years old), Magdalena (30), Amelia (27), Martirio, (24), and Adela (20). The housekeeper (La Poncia) and Bernarda's elderly mother (Mar√≠a Josefa) also live there. The deliberate exclusion of any male character from the action helps build up the high level of sexual tension that is present throughout the play. Pepe \\"el Romano\\", the love interest of Bernarda's daughters and suitor of Angustias, never appears on stage. The play explores themes of repression, passion, and conformity, and inspects the effects of men upon women. Plot summary Upon her second husband's death, domineering matriarch Bernarda Alba imposes an eight-year mourning period on her household in accordance with her family tradition. Bernarda has five daughters, aged between 20 and 39, whom she has controlled inexorably and prohibited from any form of relationship. The mourning period further isolates them and tension mounts within the household. After a mourning ritual at the family home, eldest daughter Angustias enters, having been absent while the guests were there. Bernarda fumes, assuming she had been listening to the men's conversation on the patio. Angustias inherited a large sum of money from her father, Bernarda's first husband, but Bernarda's second husband has left only small sums to his four daughters. Angustias' wealth attracts a young, attractive suitor from the village, Pepe el Romano. Her sisters are jealous, believing that it's unfair that plain, sickly Angustias should receive both the majority of the inheritance and the freedom to marry and escape their suffocating home environment. Minerva Mena in La casa de Bernarda Alba Youngest sister Adela, stricken with sudden spirit and jubilation after her father's funeral, defies her mother's orders and dons a green dress instead of remaining in mourning black. Her brief taste of youthful joy suddenly shatters when she discovers that Angustias will be marrying Pepe. Poncia, Bernarda's maid, advises Adela to bide her time: Angustias will probably die delivering her first child. Distressed, Adela threatens to run into the streets in her green dress, but her sisters manage to stop her. Suddenly they see Pepe coming down the street. She stays behind while her sisters rush to get a look, until a maid hints that she could get a better look from her bedroom window. As Poncia and Bernarda discuss the daughters' inheritances upstairs, Bernarda sees Angustias wearing makeup. Appalled that Angustias would defy her orders to remain in a state of mourning, Bernarda violently scrubs the makeup off her face. The other daughters enter, followed by Bernarda's elderly mother, Maria Josefa, who is usually locked away in her room. Maria Josefa announces that she wants to get married; she also warns Bernarda that she'll turn her daughters' hearts to dust if they cannot be free. Bernarda forces her back into her room. It turns out that Adela and Pepe are having a secret affair. Adela becomes increasingly volatile, defying her mother and quarreling with her sisters, particularly Martirio, who reveals her own feelings for Pepe. Adela shows the most horror when the family hears the latest gossip about how the townspeople recently tortured a young woman who had delivered and killed an illegitimate baby. Tension explodes as family members confront one another and Bernarda pursues Pepe with a gun. A gunshot is heard outside. Martirio and Bernarda return and imply that Pepe has been killed. Adela flees into another room. With Adela out of earshot, Martirio tells everyone else that Pepe actually fled on his pony. Bernarda remarks that as a woman she can't be blamed for poor aim. A shot is heard, immediately she calls for Adela, who has locked herself into a room. When Adela doesn't respond, Bernarda and Poncia force the door open. Soon Poncia's shriek is heard. She returns with her hands clasped around her neck and warns the family not to enter the room. Adela, not knowing that Pepe survived, has hanged herself. The House Of Bernarda Alba by the senior generation of Hamazkayin ‚ÄúArek‚Äù Theatre. The closing lines of the play show Bernarda characteristically preoccupied with the family's reputation. She insists that Adela has died a virgin and demands that this be made known to the whole town. (The text implies that Adela and Pepe had an affair; Bernarda's moral code and pride keep this from registering). No one is there to cry.

Extractive Industries Review  In July 2001 the World Bank launched an independent inquiry called the Extractive Industries Review (EIR). The review was headed by Salim. Salim held consultations with a wide range of stakeholders in 2002 and 2003. The EIR recommendations were published in January 2004 in a final report entitled Striking a Better Balance. The report concluded that fossil fuel and mining projects do not alleviate poverty and recommended that World Bank involvement with these sectors be phased out by 2008 to be replaced by investment in renewable energy and clean energy. The World Bank published its Management Response to the EIR in September 2004. The EIR served to alter the World Bank's policies on oil, gas and mining. Following the EIR process, the World Bank also issued a revised Policy on Indigenous Peoples.

Licensed to Sparks, Nevada, United States, the station is part of Tom Quinn's Reno Media Group and serves the Reno area. The station is currently owned by Americom Limited Partnership. The station's studios are located on Matley Lane in East Reno, and its transmitter is located east of Sparks. History The station went on the air as KROI on November 1, 1979. On February 11, 1984, the station changed its call sign to KORY, then on March 1, 1985 to KPLY, on March 5, 2001 to KBZZ, on March 15, 2018 to KSGG, and on March 23, 2018 to KZTQ. KPLY enjoyed great local and regional success while being hosted by long time sports announcer \\"Bob D.\\" (Robert Dirosario), and his sports sidekick, \\"Truckee\\" Mike Leach. Frequent guest Reno sports experts included sportsbook director John Pinto of the Silver Legacy Reno, the late Paul Sonner, who was the owner of Bully's Sports Bars, sportsbook manager Eric Brownlee of the Club Cal Neva, sports handicapping expert and bookmaker Chris Andrews, (who is now the sportsbook director with The South Point in Las Vegas), and Friday night horse racing coverage and analysis with \\"Pony\\" Bob Wilkie. The Bob D KPLY daily sports morning program offered extensive information on sports and sports wagering for the average fan, and also the more knowledgeable fan. The Jim Rome syndicated show was a long running staple on KPLY, as was the Sports Fan Radio Network. Prior to that time, the call letters KBZZ (1400 on the AM dial) were used by a long-standing news and music station in La Junta, Colorado, now KBLJ. In early 2001, after adopting the KBZZ call letters and the nickname \\"The Buzz\\", the station added Howard Stern in mornings, followed by a local show with Bob Garrison, the syndicated Don and Mike show and then the syndicated Tom Leykis program in late afternoons. Tom Quinn, president of Americom Broadcasting (owner of KBZZ), had selected the \\"hot talk\\" format after his success with Stern in Las Vegas. KBZZ immediately became the top-rated AM station in Reno, beating long-time news/talk station KKOH. However, after a decade of success, a number of factors hurt KBZZ. Stern's move to satellite radio, Don Geronimo's decision to quit his show and CBS' decision to drop the Tom Leykis syndicated program, those changes severely damaged KBZZ's ratings.

Early life Henry Winthrop Sargent was born in Boston, the first child of Hannah (Welles) Sargent and artist Henry Sargent (1770‚Äì1845), formerly of Gloucester, Massachusetts. His younger brother, John Turner Welles Sargent (1814‚Äì1877), was married to Amelia Jackson Holmes (1843‚Äì1889), the only daughter of Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. He was the grandson of Daniel Sargent Sr. and Mary (n√©e Turner) Sargent (1744‚Äì1813). He was the nephew of author Lucius Manlius Sargent (1786‚Äì1867), and merchant Daniel Sargent (1764‚Äì1842), who were cousins of American Revolutionary War soldier Paul Dudley Sargent (1745‚Äì1828). Sargent was educated at the Boston Latin School and at Harvard College, where he graduated in the class of 1830. Career Henry Winthrop Sargent & Family, circa 1852 Sargent studied law in the Boston office of Samuel Hubbard and then but never practiced law. He next became a partner in the banking house of Gracie & Sargent in New York City, agents of his uncle, Samuel Welles, a Paris banker. In 1841, Sargent retired and moved to \\"Wodenethe\\", an estate of about on a plateau overlooking the Hudson River just above Fishkill Landing (now Beacon), New York, which soon became famous for its distant views and its vistas cut through the native forest to the Hudson and the mountains, and for its extensive plantation of coniferous trees. He was an early friend of the great landscape gardener, Andrew Jackson Downing, from whom he derived his earliest lessons, and he edited one of the editions of Mr. Downing's work.Meehan, Thomas. The Gardener's Monthly And Horticulturist V24, Charles H. Merot, 1882 The poet William Cullen Bryant was a visitor to \\"Wodenethe\\", named for the Saxon for \\"sylvan promontory\\".Meehan, Thomas. The Gardener's Monthly And Horticulturist V24, \\"Wodenethe\\", Charles H. Merot, 1882 While \\"Wodenethe\\" was their primary residence, the Sargents also kept a house at 5 Marlborough Street in Boston.\\"5 Marlborough Street\\", Bosarchitecture =Literary works= In 1847-49, Sargent travelled with his family in Europe and the Levant, primarily to gather plants and to study the design of parks and country places. As a result, he later published a comprehensive garden guide entitled Skeleton Tours (1870), which included the British Isles, the Scandinavian Peninsula, Russia, Poland, and Spain. He was a frequent contributor to horticultural papers, especially to the Horticulturist, and in 1873 with Charles Downing he wrote a supplement to Andrew Downing's Cottage Residences (1842). Sargent's most important literary contribution is his supplement to the sixth (1859) and subsequent editions of Downing's A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening (1841). In this he gave an account of the newer deciduous and evergreen plants and told in considerable detail of the development of his own \\"Wodenethe\\" and of the estate of his relative, Horatio Hollis Hunnewell, in Wellesley, Massachusetts. A second supplement, added in the edition of 1875, gives a brief account of trees and shrubs introduced since 1859. In a period which marks the beginning of the professional practice of landscape architecture in the United States, this book and its supplement exerted a great influence on popular taste. Sargent's influence may also be seen more directly in the horticultural interests of his kinsmen, Hunnewell and Charles Sprague Sargent. Personal life On January 10, 1839, Sargent married Caroline Olmsted (1819‚Äì1887), daughter of Maria (n√©e Wyckoff) and Francis Olmsted of New York. There were three children of this marriage, two of whom predeceased their father, including: * Winthrop Henry Sargent (1840‚Äì1916), who married Aim√©e Rotch (1852‚Äì1918) * Francis Sargent (1844‚Äì1869) Sargent died on November 11, 1882 and was buried at Saint Lukes Church Cemetery in Beacon, New York.

It was defeated by a margin of 56% to 44%. In 2006, the Washington State Legislature required Sound Transit and the Regional Transportation Investment District or RTID planning committee to jointly submit to voters a transportation financing plan in the 2007 general election. RTID and Sound Transit began working together on the Roads & Transit plan in June 2006. Along with regional planning and transportation agencies, they conducted years of engineering and design work. They also informed the public and collected public comments through open houses, surveys, letters, meetings and hearings. Content Roads and Transit proposed to expand mass transit and improve roads in the most heavily traveled corridors in Snohomish, King and Pierce counties. It is a unified program of investments in highways, light- and commuter-rail, HOV lanes, park-and-ride lots, and express and local bus service. Working together, Sound Transit and RTID combined two plans in order to create a comprehensive and balanced Roads and Transit package. Sound Transit's portion of the Roads and Transit package, ST2, was intended to extend the Puget Sound region‚Äôs light-rail system to , created thousands of new Park and Ride slots, and expanded bus and commuter- rail service. It was projected to cost approximately $24 billion over twenty years, to be financed by extending a regional sales tax of 0.4% and adding an extra 0.5% sales tax. RTID's portion of the Roads and Transit package, Blueprint for Progress, would have invested in state highways, bridges, and local roads in Snohomish, King, and Pierce counties in order to ease choke- points and improve safety. Increasing sales tax by 0.1% and the motor vehicle excise tax by 0.8% was projected to fund the package's twenty-year cost of $14 billion. People and Organizations Involved =Supporters= Supporters of Roads and Transit argue that the package provides a balanced and comprehensive approach to solve the traffic problem in the Puget Sound region. The plan provides commuters with options for when they travel. For instance, it extends the region's light rail system to , which helps lift commuters out of congestion and make the environment cleaner. Additionally, nearly 12,000 park and rides slot will be created. Supporters concerned with the safety of roads have also endorsed the Roads and Transit proposal because it replaces and retrofits overpasses and bridges vulnerable to earthquakes. Moreover, by reducing congestion, first responders and emergency services will be able to move more quickly on roads. By reducing congestion, Roads and Transit plans to help the Puget Sound region's economy, allowing people and goods to move more quickly and reliably. Improving freight mobility will help the region compete in an expanding global economy. Endorsers Organizations that endorsed the Yes on Roads and Transit proposal include: * Washington Conservation Voters * Washington State Labor Council * City of Bellevue * Futurewise.org * American Council of Engineering Companies ‚Äì Washington * Downtown Seattle Association * Puget Sound Energy * Washington Association of Realtors * City of Edmonds =Opponents= King County Executive Ron Sims was the most well- known opponent of the plan. He charged in a Seattle Times op-ed on September 19, 2007 that the plan did too little to deal with the problem of global warming and relied too heavily on a single technology, rail. Prominent in the opposition against the Roads and Transit proposal was Kemper F.

She was named after the constellation Bo√∂tes. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. Construction Bootes was laid down on 24 April 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1656, as the Liberty ship SS Thomas Oliver Larkin, by California Shipbuilding Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California; launched on 16 May 1943; sponsored by Larkin‚Äôs granddaughter Mrs. H. Toulmin; renamed Bootes and designated AK-99 on 27 May 1943; delivered to the Navy on 29 May 1943; and commissioned on 15 July 1943, Lieutenant Commander Howard P. Bacon, USNR, in command. Service history After conversion and outfitting at San Diego, California, Bootes got underway for the New Hebrides Islands on 28 August. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 2 October, and remained there nine days. On 11 October, the cargo ship stood out of Segond Channel on her way to Melbourne, Australia. She entered Melbourne harbor on 20 October, and began a week-long sojourn. Bootes embarked upon the voyage back to the United States on 27 October, and arrived in San Francisco, California, on 24 November. The ship loaded cargo at San Francisco and, on 13 December, laid in a course for Australia. Bootes was one of five Navy manned Liberties assigned 8 December 1943, to the Southwest Pacific Area for service under operational control of the Commander, Seventh Fleet in meeting US Army requirements. She reached Australia in mid-January 1944 and, by 6 February, was operating between Australian ports and various locations on the eastern coast of New Guinea. = Invasion of Aitape = During her operations between Australia and the coast of eastern New Guinea, Bootes took part in her only amphibious assault of the war. On 23 April, the day after the initial landings at Aitape, on the northeastern coast of New Guinea, she arrived off the invasion beaches there. The ship carried cargo and equipment for reinforcements belonging to the Army's 127th Regiment, 32d Infantry Division. She remained there for three days but saw no action. = Etamin gets hit with a torpedo = In fact the only enemy air reaction came a little before midnight on 27 April, when three Japanese aircraft scored a single torpedo hit on . When Bootes departed Aitape on 29 April, she had Etamin in tow for Langemak Bay located just to the south of Finschhafen on the Huon Peninsula of eastern New Guinea. = Supplying Navy ships with ammunition = From there, the cargo ship continued on to Brisbane, Australia, where she arrived on 28 May. About a month later, she returned to the New Guinea coast to begin service as an ammunition issue ship at various locations on the island. Early in September, Bootes moved to Seeadler Harbor, Manus, where she resumed duty issuing ammunition to ships of the 7th Fleet. The cargo ship served at Seeadler Harbor from 7 September until 20 October, at which time she set sail for Australia. She arrived at Brisbane on 28 October, and remained there until 14 November. = Issuing ammunition at Leyte = On that day, Bootes put to sea bound ultimately for Leyte in the Philippines. She made stops on the New Guinea coast and, during the transit from New Guinea to Leyte, saw action against several Japanese air attacks. The cargo ship claimed two kills during those attacks while suffering no damage herself. She arrived safely at Leyte on 6 December, and began a six-month tour of duty as an ammunition issue ship. = End-of-war operations = Bootes concluded her assignment at Leyte on 12 June 1945, when she put to sea for Manus. She stopped at Seeadler Harbor from 22 June to 16 July, before continuing on to Australia. The cargo ship arrived in Brisbane on 22 July, and remained there for a month. On 23 August, she got underway for the Philippines. Bootes entered Leyte Gulf on 3 September, and stayed there until late November. She embarked upon the voyage back to the United States on 27 November, and reached Pearl Harbor in mid-December. Decommissioning  Bootes was decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 22 April 1946. She was towed to San Francisco, California, in the spring of 1947, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 August 1947. The ship was returned to MARCOM on 11 September 1947, and she was berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California.

He distinguished himself as a missionary, an author and a church official. He was the founder of Anglo Chinese School in Singapore in 1886. Early life William was born in Bangalore, India, the son of James and Mary Elizabeth Oldham. James was a British officer commanding Sepoy troops in India. William's ancestry was primarily Irish-English, with some Indian blood, it was said, on his mother's side. Although he was baptized a Roman Catholic, his earliest religious contacts came from Protestant military chaplains and the headmaster of the Madras Christian College. His father, though a Catholic, had turned anti-Romanist, and Oldham had absorbed the religious teachings of the Protestants when attending Anglican schools. He recollected that as a child of six, missionaries had taught him the childs prayer, \\"O Lord save me, O Lord Christ convert me\\" which remained with him to adulthood and helped transform his faith. The young Oldham studied Paley's Evidences of Christianity so well he won a competitive prize for this subject. Oldham's keen abilities in apologetics came to the fore in Madras Christian College where non-Christians frequently presented strong counter-arguments against Christianity. Yet Oldham claimed that during this time he did not yet have a true Christian faith. Education and conversion Oldham earned a B.A. degree from Boston University and an M.A. from Allegheny College, and became a government surveyor. He was handpicked for the Great Trigonometric Survey of India, a key 19th century survey of India and its adjoining lands. It was in 1873, in the midst of this secular work, that Oldham was invited to the preaching tents of visiting American Daniel O. Fox. The teachings of these Methodist missionaries, led by Bishop William Taylor, were strange yet attractive to Oldham. Bishop Taylor himself had served in far-flung mission fields including the Americas and Australia, and had been brought to India through the invitation of Bishop James Thoburn. Bishop Thoburn also had a Chinese background, and he was to be an influence on Oldham's decision to serve in Southeast Asia and thereafter to assume the mantle of the Bishopric. Oldham later compiled Thoburn's biography in a work entitled Thoburn Called of God (1918), testifying to the influence of his mentor. He thus was converted and became a Methodist at Poona while attending evangelistic services held by Taylor. In 1879, married and living in Bangalore, he committed himself to work as a Methodist missionary and traveled to Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, for training. In 1885 he was sent to Singapore to initiate a Methodist mission. There he found access to the Chinese merchant population through schools; he established what became the first of a large number of Methodist schools in what was then British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), as well as the first Methodist Church in Singapore. Missionary ministry Oldham entered the Michigan Annual Conference of the M.E. Church in 1883. He also served for a time under the auspices of the Ohio Conference. He was the founder of a mission. Ministry in Singapore The Oldhams were then appointed to accompany Bishop Thoburn to begin pioneering Methodist work in Singapore. They arrived on 7 February 1885 on the SS Khandalla, and was welcomed by Charles Phillips. The Oldhams' work included English services at the Town Hall, talks in homes, evangelistic meetings at The Christian Institute at Waterloo Street and regular street preaching. Sometimes pelted by rotten eggs during his outdoor preaching, this gifted orator nevertheless attracted a following, and on Oldham's 32nd birthday in 1886, the first local Methodist Church held its dedication service. In due time, it became known as the Wesley Methodist Church. At its stone-laying ceremony in 1907, Oldham remembered, with pride, how the church had been self-sufficient from the day it was established, funded mainly by a small band of believers united by the English language and their faith. The first Chinese to join the Methodist Church led Oldham to participate in the Celestial Reasoning Association, a debating society which the Straits Chinese formed to help develop their skills in English and moral thinking. At a meeting held in the home of Tan Keong Saik, Oldham gave a talk on astronomy. The Association, presided by the Chinese Consul to Singapore, thus introduced Oldham to educated and well-to-do Chinese merchants who were keen to have their sons and themselves educated in English and Western culture. With 36 boys in a shophouse and strong funding from these Chinese merchants, Oldham began the Anglo-Chinese School at 70 Amoy Street on 1 March 1886. The first boys included Tan Keong Saik's sons and Tan Jiak Kim's brothers. Within a year he had an enrolment of more than 100 boys. Oldham was greatly encouraged when half of the $12,000 required to build the new school building at Coleman Street was almost wholly raised by the Chinese largely through the influence of Tan Jiak Kim. Thus began Oldham's educational mission in Singapore. In addition to founding the Anglo-Chinese School, Oldham also established the Anglo-Tamil School in September 1885 with the help of the first foreign recruit, M Gnanamuthoo, a Tamil teacher who had been a resident in Rangoon. It was, however, the education of girls that Oldham was keen to leave his mark. With strong help from Sophia Blackmore, an Australian missionary who had arrived in Singapore via India in 1887, the Fairfield Methodist Girls' School as well as the Methodist Girls' School were subsequently established. Although these schools were built as American Methodist institutions, the Englishman had good support from the British government in Malaya. In the setting up of these institutions, Oldham had also received much help from fellow missionaries and educationists such as Dr Shellabear, Rev. W. T. Cherry, Rev. G. F. Pykett and Rev. W. E. Horley. These schools extended English education to the locals and thus laid the foundation of an English-speaking workforce. Some of Oldham's noteworthy pupils included Rev Goh Hood Keng, one of the earliest local preachers. Oldham also continued Ms Cooke's ministry for seamen, holding Sunday services on-board ships. With his fluency in Tamil, he held regular services for jailed Tamil prisoners at the Bras Basah jail. Oldham went on to appoint Benjamin Pillai to serve the Tamil community. Work amongst the Tamils grew steadily under the leadership of C. W. Underwood who had come to Singapore via Jaffna, Ceylon in 1887. Oldham was also instrumental in helping to set up the publishing industry in the Methodist church, which he did by purchasing a printing press and by sending W. G. Shellabear, a noteworthy Malay scholar, for training in printing. This eventually led to the establishment of the Methodist Publishing House (MPH). Oldham was also involved in the early beginnings of medical missions which was spearheaded by Dr B. F. West, with Oldham bringing medical supplies from India. Unfortunately, with a full day teaching at school and preaching on weekends, the work soon took its toll on Oldham who, after four years of labour, had to take leave for the United States in 1889. Oldham was a member of M.E. General Conferences in 1880, 1900, 1904, 1908 and 1912. He was a delegate to the Second and Fourth Ecumenical Conferences in 1891 and 1911, as well as the Edinburgh Convention in 1910. Episcopal ministry Even in America, Oldham continued to served actively, leading churches, lecturing and encouraging future church leaders to work in Southeast Asia. He established a vibrant ministry while serving as a pastor in Butler Street Church in Pittsburg, and was also the Chair of Missions at the Ohio Wesleyan University. At Pittsburg, a revival drew more than 60 young men. Among them was Titus Lowe who later succeeded Oldham as Bishop to Malaysia. In 1895, at Ohio Wesleyan University, Oldham founded the Chair of Missions and Comparative Religions, and taught about Southeast Asia from his years of experience. When he was appointed in 1904 as Missionary Bishop of Southern Asia, Oldham used Singapore as his base for his travels to the Philippines, Indonesia and parts of Malaya. He was officially welcomed as bishop in Singapore on 23 February 1905. Under his episcopacy, he extended the missions to the Malay Peninsula and Java and Sumatra. Oldham also organised the missions into the four key language groups, namely English, Tamil, Malay and Chinese - a structure that continues to exist in the Methodist churches of Singapore today. Continuing his work in educational missions, Oldham pushed for a higher level of education and mooted for an Anglo-Chinese College but this did not materialised until the founding of the Raffles College decades later. He also saw to the founding of the Jean Hamilton Memorial School, the first local institution to train Asian ministers. On 4 February 1909, Oldham officially opened the Wesley Methodist Church. During this time, Oldham published his reflections on Malaya in a book entitled Malaysia: Natures wonderland (1907). He also served as an Assistant (Corresponding) Secretary of Missions for his denomination, beginning in 1912. During his term, Oldham also faced difficult challenges. In 1909, Nicholas Zamora, an eloquent leader in the Methodist Church in the Philippines, led an attempt to secede from the episcopacy which Oldham had been heading. The painful split in the Filipina Methodist Church was a difficult matter for the Bishop. Ministry beyond Asia He was elected a bishop of the M.E. Church in 1916, serving until his death. His office was at 150 Fifth Avenue, New York City and his residence was in Leonia, New Jersey. He was also a trustee of the Union Missionary Institute in Brooklyn, New York. He also served as an Assistant (Corresponding) Secretary of Missions for his denomination, beginning in 1912. Despite his popularity and success, Oldham's term as bishop in Asia came to an abrupt in 1912 when he was appointed a coordinate secretary to the Methodist Board of Foreign Missions in New York. His abilities in fundraising and networking were needed to reduce the financial crisis the Board was facing. Oldham rose to the occasion and settled the crisis in four years. Whilst in this position, he also encouraged more indigenous leadership. Oldham went on to take charge of the Methodist work as Bishop to South America in Buenos Aires in 1916. Even there, he and his wife continued to establish schools. In Asia, Oldham saw two major losses to his missions: the Java missions was discontinued in 1928, and the Methodist Publishing House was relinquished to a secular company in 1927. The Oldhams ended their term of service in 1928 where Oldham retired to Broad Street Church in Columbus, Ohio, before returning to Bangalore in 1933. In November 1934, Oldham and his wife returned to Singapore from Bangalore to celebrate the Golden Jubilee (50th anniversary) of the founding of the Methodist Church in Singapore which was to be held in January the following year. By this time the Oldhams had become American citizens. This was to be Oldham's last visit to Singapore. He died 27 March 1937 in Pasadena, California, at the age of 83. Today, Oldham is remembered annually on 1 March, designated as Founder's Day at the Anglo- Chinese Schools. In memory of him, the Wesley Methodist church also erected an apse in 1957 to commemorate its 50th anniversary. The stained-glass window at the apse shows the life of Oldham and the church's milestones. Oldham Lane near Dhoby Ghaut, is named after him. Death and burial Oldham died on 27 March 1937 in Glendale, California. He was buried in Forest Lawn cemetery. Selected writings * Translated from Malaysia, Charles A.

Formerly the site of a Cherokee village and Appalachian community, the valley's bottomland is now home to the main entrance to the North Carolina side of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Oconaluftee area parallels the Oconaluftee River as its basin gradually broadens from Smokemont in the north to the southern tip of the Qualla Boundary. The Qualla Boundary, commonly known as Cherokee, North Carolina, comprises the bulk of a federal trust that acts a reservation for the Eastern Band of the Cherokee. The national park lands in Oconaluftee are home to the Oconaluftee Visitor Center, Mingus Mill, and the Mountain Farm Museum. Much of the area is part of the Oconaluftee Archaeological District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geology Deep Creek Valley, part of the Oconaluftee watershed Near Newfound Gap, several small creeks converge to form Beech Flats Prong. This stream flows south along the southern base of Mount Kephart, dropping 2,000 feet (600 m) over before merging with Kephart Prong, Kanati Fork, and Smith Branch to form the Oconaluftee River. The Oconaluftee continues southward, cutting a valley between the Richland Mountain massif to the east and the Thomas Ridge massif to west. The confluence of the Oconaluftee River and Bradley Fork at Smokemont strengthens the river considerably, with the valley broadening as a result. Near the park boundary, a large and relatively flat bottomland has been created by the river's junction with Raven Fork, which flows down from the northeast. Past Cherokee, the river turns west en route to its mouth along the Tuckasegee River, near Bryson City. The rock formation underlying the area around the Oconaluftee-Raven Fork junction contains some of the oldest exposed rocks in the Eastern United States. This formation, which is composed primarily of an Early Precambrian basement rock known as granite gneiss, was formed over a billion years ago from the gradual accumulation of marine sediment and igneous rocks.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 45, 101. The upper elevations of the Oconaluftee Valley are underlain by a Late Precambrian metamorphic rock of the Ocoee Supergroup, which is the dominant rock class in the Great Smokies. These rocks were formed from ocean sediments nearly 400 million years ago, and were thrust upward during the Appalachian orogeny, when the North American and African plates collided.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 23‚Äì27. The Greenbrier Fault, which crosses the Oconaluftee River between Tow String Creek and Mingus Creek, divides the basement formation from the Late Precambrian formation.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 32. Exposures of both rock formations can be seen along U.S. Route 441 between Newfound Gap and Cherokee.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 98‚Äì101. History =Early history= The Oconaluftee bottomlands, with Rattlesnake Mountain rising in the distance. The Cherokee considered the waters of the Oconaluftee sacred. Dora Woodruff Cope, who lived in the Oconaluftee valley near Smokemont around 1900, recalled a legend her Cherokee neighbors told her: > ... part of the river was called Ya'nu-u'nata wasti'yi, \\"Where the bears > wash.\\" It was a deeper part of the river, where all the animals came to wash > and heal their wounds when they had been hurt by hunters. No white person > had ever seen this place because evil had blinded us to its existence. The > animals knew how to find it, and diving into it meant instant > healing.Florence Cope Bush, Dorie: Woman of the Mountains (Knoxville: > University of Tennessee Press, 1992), 18. The term \\"Oconaluftee\\" comes from the Cherokee village name Egwanulti, which means \\"by the river\\", and appears in the journals of John Bartram in 1775.James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972), 517. Where along the river this village was located is unknown, although anthropologist James Mooney believed it to be situated near modern Birdtown, between Cherokee and Bryson City. Archaeological evidence, however, has identified a Cherokee settlement along the Oconaluftee north of the Qualla Boundary, just inside the present-day national park. While the Cherokee roamed the Smokies far and wide, this is the only known permanent Cherokee settlement within the park boundaries.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 18. This village was probably destroyed in 1776 by the army of General Griffith Rutherford during the American Revolution.James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972), 49. =19th century= Enloe Barn at the Oconaluftee Mountain Farm Museum Messer's Applehouse; apples, a staple crop in the area, were eaten raw or converted into apple butter or apple cider. 19th century fence at Mountain Farm Museum Meat storage house, used mostly for pork, at the Mountain Farm Museum See also Cherokee, North Carolina John Jacob Mingus (ca. 1774‚Äì1852), who arrived in the Oconaluftee in the 1790s, was the first Euro- American settler in the valley and the first within the boundaries of what is now the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.Daniel Pierce, The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), 9. Mingus purchased the land from Felix Walker, a land speculator and later North Carolina Congressman. While Mingus roamed from county to county in the Southern Appalachians, his descendants would remain in the area until the establishment of the park. Mingus was followed by Abraham Enloe (1770‚Äì1840), who settled downstream from the Mingus plot. Due to Enloe's resemblance to Abraham Lincoln, many locals believed he was the president's father. Later Euro-American arrivals included Isaac Bradley (1772‚Äì1855), whose family settled in the vicinity of the stream that now bears their name, and Aden Carver (1844‚Äì1945), who lived near Smokemont. In 1831, Enloe entered into a partnership with William Holland Thomas (1805‚Äì1893) to form the Oconaluftee Turnpike Company. The company widened the Indian Gap Trail from Oconaluftee to the crest of the Smokies, allowing wagon access to saltpeter mines on Mount Le Conte. The road's first tollkeeper, Robert Collins, would later guide Arnold Guyot on surveying expeditions across the crest of the Smokies. Mount Collins, between Clingmans Dome and Newfound Gap, is named for him.Michael Frome, Strangers In High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 107. Thomas, the son of caucasian parents who was adopted by Cherokee peace chief Yonaguska, took control of Cherokee business affairs in the 1830s. His land purchases for the tribe included the Qualla Boundary, which became the backbone of the federal trust for the Eastern Band of the Cherokee. After the 1835 Treaty of New Echota ordered the Cherokees' removal from all eastern lands, Thomas went to Washington and successfully argued that since the Oconaluftee Cherokees were North Carolina citizens, the treaty didn't apply to them. In 1868, the Eastern Band was recognized as a separate tribe.Vicki Rozema, Footsteps of the Cherokees (Winston-Salem: John F. Blair Publisher, 1995), 58‚Äì60. =20th century= In the late 19th-century, innovations in the band saw and logging railroad led to a logging boom in Southern Appalachia. With base camps at Smokemont, the Three M Lumber Company and later the Champion Fibre Company cut much of the Oconaluftee valley before its tract was bought out by the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission in the 1930s. In 1925, a massive forest fire quickly swept across the dried brush left over from the extensive logging, scorching much of the southern slopes of the Smokies.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg, Tennessee: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 125, 325. After the establishment of the national park, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was set up at Smokemont to construct roads and trails in the area. In 1937, the CCC restored Mingus Mill, a large turbine-driven gristmill on Mingus Creek. In the 1950s, several log structures were moved to an area adjacent to the Oconaluftee Visitor Center to form the Mountain Farm Museum, which provides an exhibition of pioneer life in Appalachia. Present day Bradley Fork at Smokemont Mountain Farm Museum The John Davis Cabin Students on field trip at the John Davis Cabin (July 2012) Along with the historic sites in the vicinity of the Oconaluftee Visitor Center, the park service maintains a large campground at the former logging camp of Smokemont. The small mountain hamlet of Tow String is sandwiched between the national park and Qualla Boundary, just above Oconaluftee. The southern terminus of the Blue Ridge Parkway is at the valley's southern tip, near the river's confluence with Raven Fork. A leg of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail connects Oconaluftee with the Appalachian Trail near the summit of Clingmans Dome. The Bradley Fork Trail follows Bradley Fork north from Smokemont to the Cabin Flats area between Hughes Ridge and Richland Mountain. From here, the Dry Sluice Gap Trail continues north to the crest of the Smokies, emerging near Charlies Bunion. In 1982, the Oconaluftee area was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Oconaluftee Archaeological District. =Mingus Mill= Mingus Mill was built in 1886 by the millwright Sion Thomas Early of Sevier County, Tennessee. Early did the work for John Mingus, a son of John Jacob Mingus. Early completed the mill in three months for a cost of $600. The mill operated at wholesale and retail levels until the National Park Service purchased the property in 1934. The mill was restored in 1937, closed during World War II, and reopened in 1968. Water diverted from Mingus Creek via a sluice (canal) and a wooden flume turns two turbines which provide power to the mill. An iron shaft connects the turbines to grindstones on the first floor and a wheat cleaner and bolting chest on the second floor (the latter two via a series of pulleys). Wheat or corn is first transported by bucket belt to the wheat cleaner, which is essentially a fan which clears the grain of dirt and excess material, and then drops it back to the first floor. The cleaned grain is then fed into the grindstones, which break it down into flour (or cornmeal). The flour is then transported back to the second floor and fed into the bolting chest, which uses bolts of progressively coarser cloth to separate the flour into different grades. While the mill's turbine is not as photogenic as the overshot wheels that power mills such as the Cable Mill at Cades Cove, it was more efficient and required less water power to operate. The turbine generated approximately turning at 400 rpm. Aden Carver, who arrived in Oconaluftee in the mid-19th century, helped Early build the mill in 1886. When the mill was restored in 1937, Carver, then in his 90s, aided in its restoration.Information in this section obtained from interpretive signs provided by the National Park Service at the Mingus Mill site, July 2007. =Oconaluftee Visitor Center= The original visitor center at Oconaluftee was built in 1940 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) as a ranger station and magistrate's courtroom. The stone-and-log cabin was designated a \\"temporary\\" visitor center in 1947, and stayed that way until 2011, when a brand-new center was built in just two months in late winter and early spring, and dedicated on April 15.http://www.nps.gov/grsm/parknews/ovc-dedicated.htm The Great Smoky Mountains Association paid three million dollars for the buildings (the other being a highly efficient restroom facility between it and the original center), and Friends of the Smokies donated over half a million more for the exhibits inside. Trotter & Associates Architects, LLC was the architect of record for the new visitor center. No government or taxpayer money was allocated for the project, so construction costs had to come entirely from donations to the two groups, which in turn donated the center to the National Park Service. The center and restrooms are open year-round, and after 64 years of \\"temporary\\" use, the original building has finally been reverted to its original administrative use, though its rustic and historic \\"parkitecture\\" remains untouched on the outside. Just to the south on U.S. 441 is the southern end of the Blue Ridge Parkway, which unlike GSMNP and 441, is normally closed in winter. =Mountain Farm Museum= Adjacent to the Oconaluftee Visitor Center is the Mountain Farm Museum. The museum is a collection of several log buildings from various places around the park, the purpose of which is to depict a typical mountain farm in pioneer Appalachia. Gardens are planted during the spring and summer, and barn fowl roam the premises. Since most of the structures were not moved from their original locations intact, they are not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The park service maintains them by the same standards, however. Structures at the Mountain Farm Museum:Unless otherwise noted, information in this section obtained from: Tom Robbins, Mountain Farm Museum Self-Guided Tour (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, date not given). John Davis Cabin, built in 1900. This cabin was originally located on Indian Creek several miles to the west above Bryson City. John Davis moved to the area in 1885 to free-range his livestock.Ed Trout, Historic Buildings of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1995), 12. The cabin was constructed with matched chestnut logs joined with dove-tail notches. Enloe Barn, built around 1880 by Abraham Enloe's grandson, Joseph, who owned the land where the museum is now located. The Enloes sold their farm to the Floyd family in 1917.George Ellison, \\"Mountain Farm Museum Celebrates 50th Anniversary.\\" Smoky Mountain News, 21 May 2003. Retrieved: 18 August 2007. This relatively large barn housed livestock in its lower stalls and grain and fodder in its lofts. This is the only structure that was originally located in Oconaluftee, being moved only from its native spot. The roof consists of over 16,000 hand-split shingles.Ed Trout, Historic Buildings of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1995), 47. Messer Applehouse, built by Will Messer of Cataloochee, a valley located within the park on the other side of Cataloochee Mountain to the east. At its original location, the applehouse was partially underground to help insulate it from the summer heat and winter cold. The meathouse, located just behind the cabin, was moved to the site from Cataloochee. To cure meat (usually pork) and give it flavor, a small fire was built just inside the meathouse, exposing the meat to several hours of smoke. The Baxter/Jenkins Chickenhouse, built by Willis Baxter in the late 19th century, was originally located at the base of Maddron Bald between Greenbrier and Cosby, Tennessee.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 264‚Äì266. Baxter's cabin is still located at its original site. Chickenhouses were used to protect chickens from carnivorous animals. The blacksmith shop was built around 1900 and moved to the site from Cades Cove. The springhouse, moved from Cataloochee, was used by farmers for refrigeration. Two corn cribs, built around 1900, were moved from Thomas Divide, just north of Bryson City. Corn crib roofs were often raised to place the recently cut corn crop inside. A large pitchfork was used to remove the corn via the small square doors when it was time to take the corn to the mill. Other buildings include a hog pen, a sorghum press and still (used to draw sorghum from cane and boil it into syrup), an ash hopper (water was filtered through the ashes to extract its lye, which was then mixed with hog lard to make soap), a woodshed, and native fencing. =Oconaluftee Indian Village= The Oconaluftee Indian Village is operated by the Cherokee Historical Association on the slopes of Rattlesnake Mountain inside the reservation. The outdoor museum is a replica of a typical Cherokee village from the mid-18th century.

Biography Davis left school at 15, and later graduated from the University of Dundee with an MA in criminology. As a postgraduate she received a diploma in adult and community education from the University of Edinburgh. In 1998, she left Scotland and moved to the south of England, where she lives today.Review, by Lisa DuMond Writing Her first three novels are set in the Marchmont district of Edinburgh, where she lived for many years. Her d√©but novel, Shrouded, has a trainee funeral director as protagonist. It charts his alcohol-fuelled descent into necrophilia and sexually motivated murder. It was followed by Safe As Houses, which explores the murders of a sadistic white-collar psychopath and his unsuspecting wife and child. Also set in Edinburgh, Noise Abatement is the most autobiographical of Davis's novels, in that she, like the protagonist, endured neighbours from hell when a band moved into the flat above her. She fantasized about killing them, but the hitherto law-abiding, but sleep-deprived man in the novel carries out this out. Davis set her fourth novel, Kiss It Away, in Salisbury, where she had moved. It is an unsettling exploration of male-on-male rape and of how society ignores or makes light of this violent crime. The venue of her fifth novel, Sob Story, is her birthplace, Dundee. It charts the journey of an isolated university student and her pen-pal, a violent inmate of Maidstone Prison. It was followed by Extinction, which is set in the world of bereavement counselling and features a white collar psychopath. This, in turn, was followed by Near Death Experience, a novel which draws on the author's awareness of Munchausens-by-proxy and the havoc wreaked by nurses who are personality disordered. Between novels, Carol Anne Davis has written several books on crime, each profiling a killer's childhood and formative experiences. For Women Who Kill: Profiles of Female Serial Killers, she interviewed the clergyman who heard Myra Hindley's confession, and arrived at what has been called a fair assessment of a complex case. She also contributed to the anthology, Masters of True Crime (Prometheus Books 2012). Children Who Kill: Profiles of Preteen and Teenage Killers includes details of her friendship with the then-youngest boy in Scotland ever to be charged with attempted murder. She also interviewed the detective who caught Britain's youngest serial killer, Peter Dinsdale, and found unique details about the case. In Couples Who Kill: Profiles of Deviant Duos, she met one of the surviving victims of Fred and Rosemary West, as well as corresponding with a convicted British serial killer and with a journalist who had spent time with one of America's cruellest torture-killers, now on death row. Sadistic Killers: Profiles of Pathological Predators, included input from a psychiatrist who successfully treated imprisoned psychopaths by helping them come to terms with their brutalizing childhoods. Becoming aware that sexually dominant men in consensual relationships were often dismissed by society in the same way as criminal sadists, she included a chapter on consensual sadomasochism for which she interviewed a female masochist. Youthful Prey: Child Predators Who Kill profiles some British, US, Canadian and European homicidal pedophiles and has chapters on treatment options and child protection. An excerpt appeared in The Sunday Times. \\"Masking Evil: When Good Men And Women Turn Criminal\\" includes interviews with a psychologist and two criminologists and profiles 37 pillars of the community who were murderers, paedophiles or repeatedly abusive parents. Crime, horror, erotic and literary short stories by Davis have appeared in anthologies, and humorous, crime and lifestyle features in magazines. She also writes in-depth features for Serial Killer Quarterly, a subscription-based e-magazine.

Early life and career Billing is said by Fuller to have been a native of Northamptonshire, where two villages near Northampton bear his name, and to have afterwards lived in state at Astwell in that county. Lord Campbell says he was an attorney's clerk; but this seems doubtful. He was, at any rate, a member of Gray's Inn. Writing to one Ledam, Billing says : 'I would ye should do well, because ye are a fellow of Gray's Inn, where I was fellow ' (Paston Letters, i. 43, 53), and, according to a Gray's Inn manuscript, he was a reader there. His social position was sufficient to enable him to be on terms of intimacy with the families of Paston and of Baron Grey de Ruthyn. He was Burgess (Member of Parliament) for Northamptonshire, 1445‚Äì46; Burgess (Member of Parliament) for London, 1449, and Recorder of London, 1450‚Äì1454. Along with seven others he received the coif as serjeant- at-law in 2 January 1453 ‚Äì 1454, and in the Hilary term of that year is first mentioned as arguing at the bar. Thenceforward his name is frequent in the reports. King‚Äôs serjeant Lord-chancellor Waynflete appointed him king's Serjeant 21 April 1458, and Lord Campbell, citing an otherwise unknown pamphlet of Billing in favour of the Lancastrian cause, says that with the attorney-general and solicitor-general he argued the cause of King Henry VI at the bar of the House of Lords. The entry in the Parliamentary Rolls, however, indicates that the judges and king's Serjeants excused themselves from giving an opinion in the matter. About the same time Billing appears to have been knighted, and on the accession of Edward IV his patent of king's Serjeant was renewed, and in the first parliament of this reign he was named, along with Serjeants Lyttelton and Laken, a referee in a cause between the Bishop of Winchester and some of his tenants. He is said by Lord Campbell to have exerted himself actively against King Henry, Queen Margaret, and the Lancastrians, and to have helped to frame the act of attainder of Sir John Fortescue, chief justice of the king's bench, for being engaged in the Battle of Towton, and to have advised the grant of a pardon, on condition that the opinions of the treatise ‚ÄòDe Laudibus‚Äô should be retracted. Judge of the King's Bench At any rate, in 1464 (9 Aug.), Billing was added to the three judges of the king's bench, but by the king's writ only: and the question being thereupon raised, it was decided that a commission in addition to the writ was required for the appointment of a justice of assize. Baker in his Chronology,' and Hale in his ‚ÄòPleas of the Crown,' says that on the trial of Walter Walker for treason in 1460, for having said to his son, 'Tom, if thou behavest thyself well, I will make thee heir to the Crown' i.e. of the Crown Inn, of which he was landlord, Billing ruled a conviction, and Lord Campbell accepts the story. But it would seem from the report of the judgment of Chief- justice Bromley in the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, 17 April 1554, that the judge at that trial was John Markham, afterwards chief justice next before Billing, and that he directed an acquittal. Chief Justice of the King‚Äôs Bench Billing succeeded Markham as chief justice of the king's bench in 23 January 1468 ‚Äì 1469, having precedence over Yelverton and Bingham, justices of the king's bench; and this office he retained in spite of political changes. For when Henry VI for a few months regained the throne new patents were at once issued, 9 October 1470; and when Edward IV overthrew him, 17 June 1471, he, along with almost all the other judges, was confirmed in his seat. It is suggested that he may have owed this less to his legal talents than to the support of the Earl of Warwick. In 1477 Billing tried Burdet of Arrow, Warwickshire, a dependent of the Duke of Clarence, for treason, committed in 1474, in saying of a stag, 'I wish that the buck, horns and all, were in the king's belly,' for which he was executed. Billing is also said to have been concerned in the trial of the Duke of Clarence himself. He continued to sit in court until 5 May 1481, when he died testate and was buried in Bittlesden Abbey, Buckinghamshire. His tombstone is now in Wappenham Church, Northamptonshire. His successor was Sir William Hussey. Family life He married (1st) Katherine Gifford, who died 8 March 1479. They had five sons, including Thomas, his heir, who died in 1500 without male issue, and four daughters. He married (2nd) Mary Folville, widow successively of William Cotton, Receiver-general of the Duchy of Lancaster, Treasurer of the Queen‚Äôs Household (killed at the 2nd Battle of St. Albans in 1461), and Thomas Lacy, of Grantchester, Cambridgeshire (died 1479), and daughter and co-heiress of John Folville, Esq., of Sileby, Rotherby, Queniborough, etc., Leicestershire, by Joan, daughter of Robert Wesenham (died 1399), of Conington, Huntingdonshire. She was born about 1423 (aged 54 in 1477). In 1483 his widow and executrix, Mary, sued William Stokker, Knt., Mayor of the Staple of Calais, in the Exchequer of Pleas regarding a debt. She was pardoned 20 Nov. 1484. Mary died 14 March 1499/1500, and was buried on the south side of the altar of the church of St. Margaret, Westminster, Middlesex by her 1st husband.

Before the armistice between Italy and the Allied armed forces on 8 September 1943, Albania had been in a de jure personal union with and was de facto under the control of the Kingdom of Italy. After the armistice and the Italian exit from the Axis, German military forces entered Albania and it came under German occupation, creating the client-state, the Albanian Kingdom. The Germans favoured the nationalist Balli Komb√´tar over King Zog I's Legalists and the occupation was marked by collaboration between them and the Germans. Albania under German occupation retained control of the areas it had received during Italian rule, including most of Kosovo, as well as Western Macedonia, the town of Tutin in Central Serbia and a strip of Eastern Montenegro. It was the policy of the Balli Komb√´tar to have all Albanian populated territories under one state.  History  =German invasion and construction of a German Albania= In anticipation of such invasion, the Wehrmacht drew up a series of military plans for action against Italian holdings in the Balkans code-named Konstantin. And for a more direct nature, units of German Military Intelligence (Abwehr) section II were sent to Mitrovica (present day Kosovo) in April 1943 in an attempt to gain some influence among the growing number of Albanians disaffected with the Italians. Even more directly, in July and August 1943, the German army occupied Albanian airports and ports, ostensibly to protect Italian Albania from the possibility of an Allied invasion. By mid- August there were some six thousand German troops in Albania. The first political move made by the Foreign Ministry prior to the invasion was the appointment of Hermann Neubacher, a former mayor of Vienna, as Ribbentrop's special representative for southeastern Europe. Neubacher, already active in the Balkans as Hitler's representative for economic concerns, would become the key German figure in the Balkans during the second half of the war, although he was not officially assigned Albania as part of his responsibility until 10 September. Apart from the appointment of Neubacher, Major Franz von Scheiger was dispatched to Mitrovica. Scheiger, who had been to Albania before as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army, was acquainted with many Albanian interwar politicians of influence on a personal basis. The Germans planned to construct an independent neutral Albania controlled by a government friendly to the Germans. After the Mukje Agreement was broken by the Albanian Partisans, war broke out between the Albanian Partisans (who were backed by the Yugoslav Partisans, who in turn were backed by the Allies) and the Balli Komb√´tar. After the capitulation of Italian forces on 8 September 1943, German troops swiftly occupied Albania with two divisions. The Germans formed a 'neutral government' in Tirana. =An independent state of Albania= The Germans were intent on setting up an autonomous administration and endeavored to persuade Albanian leaders to form a government to take over the administration of the country themselves. Many hesitated, in particular when rumors spread that British forces were preparing to invade Albania. Kosovo Albanian leaders, however, realizing that a German defeat would mean a return to Yugoslav rule, were more willing to cooperate. On 14 September 1943, an Albanian government was then set up under Ibrahim Bi√ßaku of Elbasan, Cafo Beg Ulqini Bedri Pejani and Xhafer Deva of Kosovo. The national assembly, composed of 243 members, began to function on 16 October 1943, electing a four-member High Regency Council (K√´shilli i Lart√´ i Regjenc√´s) to govern the country. German promises to preserve the 1941 borders of Albania, assurances of \\"non- interference\\" with the new Albanian administration and a general Pro-German outlook of most Albanians (dating from the years before and during the First World War where Austro-Hungarian foreign policies were supportive of an independent Albanian state), ensured that the new government initially enjoyed a large amount of support from the people. The new government, which promised to remain neutral in the war, succeeded in restoring a good deal of stability. The administration and justice systems functioned once again, and Albanian schools were reopened throughout northern and central Albania. Steps were also taken to implement a land reform. The Germans made a genuine effort, often to their own disadvantage, to leave the Albanian people the impression that they possessed at least some level of autonomy. There was no effort to forcibly recruit labour from Albania for the Reich, as it was incompatible with the notion of Albanian independence. The regent Frash√´ri also came to an agreement with Germans in February 1944 which stipulated that Albanian prisoners would not be transported out of the country, however the Germans did not always live up to this particularly towards the end of 1944. In line with Neubacher's policies towards Albania, reprisals on the civilian population for attacks on the German army were uncommon and certainly not as brutal as in other occupied territories. Frash√´ri negotiated for as much independence as he could extract from the Germans and was able to convince Neubacher to recognise Albania's \\"relative\\" neutrality and \\"relative\\" sovereignty. Albania had a status similar to that of Croatia and Slovakia, having relative sovereignty under Nazi Germany. In late November 1943 the Albanian government asked the Germans to help them convince the Kingdom of Bulgaria to extend recognition to the new state; the Germans agreed. At the same time Frasheri began negotiations for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Switzerland and Turkey. This caused some alarm at the German foreign ministry who argued that these neutral states should not be approached, but that states under German control might be asked to extend recognition. Soon after Ante Pavelic's Ustashi regime in Croatia extended their recognition to the Albanians. =Partisan resistance and Civil War= The new government and the Germans had to contend with the increasingly Communist dominated NLM and were subsequently able to coerce much of the nationalist resistance into its camp. The Germans launched a series of offensives against the Partisans, who were primarily concentrated in Southern Albania and to a lesser extent in Central Albania. The first offensive, operation \\"505\\", started in early November 1943 to clear Partisan units from the Pez√´ region and remove the threat to the Durr√´s-Tirana road. Within eight days the Germans declared the campaign a success having killed some 100 \\"bandits\\" and having taken over 1,650 prisoners, all of whom were, by earlier agreement turned over to the Albanian civil authorities. The Balli Komb√´tar was also involved in fighting the Partisans during the Winter offensive and by late winter the NLM found itself in considerable difficulty. The NLM came perilously close to being destroyed by the German and Nationalist forces, with the units that managed to escape encirclement suffering from lack of food, clothing and ammunition (as the allies were unable to resupply them from the air). German figures put the number of partisan casualties at 2,239 by the end of January, 401 dead in February and 236 in March. By then all prefectures of the new state, except Gjirokstra in the south, remained in the hands of the Albanian government. Enver Hoxha himself acknowledged that \\"the situation is difficult\\". =End of World War II and the beginning of Communism= The success of the Winter campaign proved to be short lived, and the Partisans proved to be much more resilient than the Germans, British and many Albanians had anticipated. With the Grand Alliance established, the Germans began losing the war. With the current situation favouring the communists, the partisans began a full-scale attack on the Germans and Balli Komb√´tar. British Liaison officers in Albania noted that the Communists were using the arms they received to fight fellow Albanians far more than to harass the Germans. The west noted that the Communists could not have won without the supplies and armaments from the British, America and Yugoslavia, and that the LNC were not afraid of murdering their country men.  Collaboration  =Government= Members of Regency Council ‚Äì From left to right: Fuat Dibra, Mihal Zallari, Mehdi Frash√´ri, Father Anton Harapi, Rexhep Mitrovica and Vehbi Frash√´ri After the Union with Italy was officially dissolved; many of the laws passed after Italian invasion were revoked, and Albania was declared free, neutral and independent. At the same time, the assembly revoked the draft law of June 1940 that declared Albania to be a co-belligerent with Italy. The assembly announced that Albania would be governed by a regency of four, one representative from each of Albania's four major religious communities, for the remainder of the war. The Germans had created a government similar to the one that had ruled after the retreat of Prince Wied in September 1914, demonstrating an appreciation for not only Albanian history but also for Albania's religious makeup. Lef Nosi was chosen as the Orthodox representative. Representing the Sunni Muslims, the Germans were able to attract Fuat Dibra, a landowner from new Albania who, like Nosi, had a long and distinguished record. Unlike the others, Dibra had served in the collaborationist cabinet of Mustafa Kruja, but in November 1942 he had been elected to the central committee of the Balli Komb√´tar and was therefore something of a catch for the Germans, he was replaced by Cafo Beg Ulqini. Albanian Catholics were represented by the prior of the Franciscans in Shkod√´r, Father Anton Harapi, who maintained connections with both the Kosovars and the Albanian partisans. Learning of his appointment, partisan emissaries unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade him from accepting. Hermann Neubacher seemed to have developed a warm personal relationship with Harapi, in part because Harapi had received some of his education at the monastery school of Meran and Hall in the Tyrol. Mehdi Frash√´ri, a Bektashi Muslim, was one of the most respected living Albanians. He agreed to head the Council of Regency. The leadership of the council was originally designed to rotate, but Lef Nosi declined for health reasons and Anton Harapi argued that as a Catholic monk he could accept no position in which he would be forced to sanction the death penalty. Once committed, the regency moved to form a permanent government, which would begin the process of ending the chaos and stabilizing Albania. Following hurried negotiations, on 5 November, a government headed by the Kosovar, Rexhep Mitrovica was introduced. Mitrovica's cabinet, most of whom had credentials as nationalists as well as some German or Austrian connection, included Xhafer Deva, who had studied at the Robert College of Istanbul and in Vienna, as minister of the interior and Rrok Kolaj, a Catholic from Shkod√´r who had studied at the University of Graz, as minister of Justice. Austrian educated Vehbi Frasheri was appointed as foreign minister. The Orthodox Elbasaner, Sokrat Dodbiba, the nephew of Lef Nosi, became minister of finance. =Military= German soldiers next to an Italian tank in Albania in September 1943 In line with the German policy of \\"non- interference\\" and a desire to save their own troops for deployment elsewhere an Albanian Army commanded by General Prenk Pervizi was formed soon after the new government was set up. The Germans added to the strength of several units of the regular Albanian army and also increased the effectiveness of the gendarmerie. Many units which had collaborated with the Italians were preserved and subsequently utilised by the Germans in anti-partisan operations, with the staunchly anti-communist Balli Kombetar (National Front) also being used. Soon after the Ballists and German forces pressed hard against the Communists. The Ballists destroyed a fairly large Communist partisan group south-west of Tirana. The partisan force of about 2,000 strong had been annihilated. With other major partisan forces losing, the Albanian Communists tactically retreated, establishing guerrilla warfare to fight the Balli Kombetar. The Ballists, along with the Germans, occupied the region of Chameria (Cham Albanian collaboration with the Axis). The Balli Kombetar forces were subsequently declared to be \\"co-operating with the Germans, who are exploiting them with arms in large quantities\\" according to a British Special Operations Executive report from December 1943. In Kosovo and western Macedonia, when it was a part of the independent state of Albania, the German and Ballist forces had occasional skirmishes with Yugoslav partisans. When Maqellar√´, midway between Debar and Peshkopi, was recaptured by the Fifth Partisan Brigade, the Germans with the assistance of the Ballist forces of Xhem Hasa launched an attack from Debar, defeating the partisans. Fiqri Dine, Xhem Hasa and Hysni Dema as well as three German Majors directed military campaigns against the Albanian and Yugoslav partisans. By early November the newly established forces were engaged in fighting Macedonian and Albanian Partisan units in the town of Kicevo. After 7 days of fierce fighting, the Partisans were defeated and forced to retreat from the city. A volunteer militia known as the Vulnetari were also used as frontier guards of the re- organised Albanian state. Fighting in their own local areas (in Kosovo and Macedonia), they fought against both Partisans and Chetniks, \\"against whom they showed themselves skilled and determined fighters\\". This unit often carried out cross-border raids in Nediƒá's Serbia against civilian and military targets. The Albanian and Yugoslav partisans were the main threat to Albania, but not the only force. In the Sandzak regions that were part of the independent state of Albanian, Chetnik forces harassed the local populace. D≈æemail Koniƒçanin and Ballist forces under Shaban Polluzha successfully repelled Chetnik forces back from Novi Pazar and crushed their stronghold in Banja. =Police= German column in Tirane Xhafer Deva was the Minister of the Interior and therefore the head of the police and gendarmerie in the country. A native Kosovar Albanian and deemed the most \\"effective and reliable\\" by the Germans, Deva's forces were involved in targeting the internal enemies of the state. On 4 February 1944, police units under his authority were implicated in the massacre of 86 residents of Tirana suspected of being anti-fascists and other excesses committed by the Gestapo in collaboration with the Albanian gendarmerie. Large number of Serbs were killed across Kosovo or deported to camps in Albania starting from 1942. Local Albanian fighters (Ballists) saw an opportunity to take their revenge upon their Serbian neighbours for the suffering they had endured over previous two decades (Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars, Colonisation of Kosovo). The Ballists attacked the Serb colonists, burning perhaps as many as 30,000 houses belonging to Serb and Montenegrin settlers. Roma (Gypsies) were also targeted by the gendarmerie and police force. To maintain the military occupation in the new German state of Albania, the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS sought to utilise local manpower to maintain law and order, and fight off Yugoslav Partisan and communist Albanian Resistance activity in the region. For their part Albanian leaders hoped to form an \\"army, which will be able to safeguard the borders of Kosovo and liberate the surrounding regions\\". Led by German officers, in May 1944, some troops from the division were stationed in the Gjakova area to guard the mines.  Demographics  Using Italian estimates from July 1941 the population of the Albanian Kingdom was estimated at 1,850,000. The total population of \\"old Albania\\" (encompassing pre 1941 borders) stood at 1,100,000, while \\"new Albania\\" (consisting of Kosovo, Debar and parts of Montenegro) was 750,000. The Kingdom consisted of approximately 1,190,00 Muslims (Sunni and Bektashi) and 660,000 Christians (Catholic and Orthodox). The new state consisted of two main minority groups, the Serbs of Kosovo and recent Italian Colonists scattered across Albania.  Economy  Albanian 20-franc note When Germans entered Tirana, they had hoped to find enough money in the national bank to pay their troops. This was to be considered a loan. However, they only found thirty million francs and overhead expenses for the German army in Albania proved to be about forty million francs a month. With some degree of urgency, they turned to the German authorities in Rome, where an SS commando raid had recently captured 120 million francs in notes, the plates, twenty-three sacks of gold coins and twenty-nine cases of gold bars from the main branch of the National Bank of Albania. The gold was sent to Berlin and the notes were sent to Tirana. The substantial sums were immediately transferred to the National Bank of Albania in Tirana. The money was used to pay German troops in Albania and Montenegro. It was also used to finance German construction projects such as buildings, roads, road repairs, airports and coastal gun emplacements. =Influences of Nazi Germany= In the Albanian Kingdom, which Nazi Germany formally treated as a sovereign state, much of the industrial and economic activity was either monopolised, or given a high priority for exploitation, by Germany. Almost all of the export companies operating were managed by the Germans, and mostly by the German military. The chrome ore, magnesite and lignite mines and the oilfields present across Albania were under direct German control. The most important ore reserves for the Wehrmacht in Albania were chrome ore. Chrome was found both in Old Albania and in Kosovo. In the former, there were chrome ore deposits in Kuk√´s, Klos and Pogradec. When the Germans entered the Kosovo region, there were functioning chrome mines in Gjakova and Letaj. From October 1943 to the end of August 1944 a total of 42,902 tons of Chrome were extracted from these mines, of which 28,832 tons were exported to Germany. Magnesite mines in Golesh were also of significance. From mid September 1943 to the end of August 1944 an amount equalling 2,647 tons of processed and unprocessed Magnesite were exported to Germany. Aside from Romania, Albania was the only country in southeastern Europe that had substantial oil reserves. In Devoll roughly one million tons of crude oil were processed after the oilfields were up and running by May 1944. =Currency= The currency used in Albania was the Albanian Gold Franga.

There were three battalions within the Brigade, the 1st in West Belfast, the 2nd in North Belfast and the Third in East Belfast. Most of the Brigade's attacks on Crown forces were carried out by an Active Service Unit within the 1st battalion, led by Roger McCorley. The Brigade was strengthened during the period between the end of hostilities between the IRA and British forces in July 1921 and the outbreak of the Irish Civil War in June 1922. During this time, Michael Collins, head of the new Irish Free State sent arms and money to the IRA in Belfast in an effort to de-stabilise the newly created Northern Ireland. By May 1922, the IRA in Belfast possessed over 600 rifles. They carried out many attacks on British and Northern Ireland forces during this period. In addition, they were often faced with the task of trying to defend Catholic areas of Belfast from attack by Ulster loyalist and state forces. As well as defence, though, the Brigade was also guilty of sectarian attacks, including assassinations of Protestants and the bombing of trams taking Protestant workers to workplaces that had expelled Catholics. In May 1922, the IRA in Belfast assassinated Ulster Unionist Party MP William Twaddell. In response, the next day, the UUP government of Northern Ireland interned over 200 Irish republicans in Belfast and 350 throughout Northern Ireland. Over 750 IRA men were interned by 1923. This was a damaging blow to the Belfast Brigade, but more damaging still was the outbreak of the Irish Civil War on June 28. This meant that the IRA in the south of Ireland was now split into warring factions. In addition, the aid which the Free State government had given to the northern IRA was cut off after the death of Michael Collins in August 1922. On top of this, Joe McKelvey, the leader of the IRA in Belfast, left the city to side with the Anti-Treaty IRA in the civil war. He was captured and subsequently executed by the Free State. Most of the other IRA leaders in Belfast supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty, as they had been persuaded that it would ultimately result in a united, independent Ireland. In addition over 1,000 IRA men in Belfast had to flee Northern Ireland to escape the repression there and around 500 of them were recruited into the pro-treaty National Army during the civil war. As a result of these factors, the IRA in wartime Belfast lacked the will and resources to mount a renewed armed campaign. Remarkably, however, the Brigade developed a \\"Protestant squad\\", an intelligence unit, largely recruited by John Graham, a Church of Ireland devout, from Denis Ireland's Ulster Union Club.. While Graham and others in the Belfast command continued to debate the merits of a new northern campaign, in April 1942 a diversionary action, intended to draw the RUC from an illegal 1916, developed into a gun battle in Cawnpore Street. A police constable, father of four Thomas James Forbes, was killed, in consequence of which six of the eight members of the active unit were sentenced to hang. In the event all but one were reprieved.. On 2 September 1942 Tom Williams, nineteen, was hanged the first, and only, Irish Republican to be judicially executed in the North... In the IRA Border Campaign of the 1950s, there were no actions in Belfast. It took the formation of the Provisional IRA and its Belfast Brigade in 1969 before republicans were again in a position to carry out attacks in Northern Ireland's capital city. The Official IRA also had a Belfast brigade which was commanded by Republican Billy McMillen, just like the Provisionals it carried a guerrilla campaign against the British forces in Ireland but they called a ceasefire in May 1972, but still carried out a handful of attack in 1973, 1974 & 1975, and they also became involved in a feud with the Provisionals, 11 people were killed in the feud & many more injured, the vast majority of attacks by both sides happened in Belfast.

Early life Portrait of Sargent's mother, Mary Turner, by John Singleton Copley, 1763 Sargent was born in Boston, the youngest of seven children of Daniel Sargent Sr. (1730‚Äì1806) and Mary Turner (1744‚Äì1813), daughter of John Turner of The House of the Seven Gables. His father was a merchant dealing in fishermen's supplies who had moved from Gloucester to Boston and profited so much by his industry, prudence, and popularity that he occupied what was for those days a conspicuously expensive mansion, although his character was notable for thrift and dread of ostentation. He was the brother of businessman politician Daniel Sargent and artist Henry Sargent (father of Henry Winthrop Sargent), cousin of the early advocate of women's equality Judith Sargent Murray, and the nephew of American Revolutionary War soldier Paul Dudley Sargent. His paternal grandfather was Epes Sargent, a Representative to the General Court of Massachusetts. =Education= Lucius Manlius attended a number of elementary and secondary schools, including Phillips Exeter Academy, from which he passed to Harvard in 1804. He did not complete his studies there, for a pamphlet published by him in 1807, No. 1 of the New Milk Cheese, pours furious scorn on an official of the college with whom he had had a dispute about the quality of the food at the commons table. He studied law after leaving college and was admitted to the bar on February 19, 1811, but he never practised to any extent, for he inherited wealth and greatly increased it by conservative speculation. Career He turned to literature as a vocation, publishing The Culex of Virgil; with a Translation into English Verse and a collection of Latin riddles in 1807 and Hubert and Ellen, a volume of poems, in 1812. At the Boston peace celebration on February 22, 1815 (following the War of 1812), an ode of his, \\"Wreaths for the Chieftain,\\" was sung. He wrote constantly for the newspapers and became well known for his literary interests. =Temperance= He found a popular subject in temperance reform, which he took up with characteristic assertiveness. From 1830 till the approach of the Civil War he spoke and wrote on this theme so frequently and vigorously that he became one of the most uncompromising and conspicuous leaders in the crusade against liquor. He wrote Three Temperance Tales (2 vols., 1848), twenty-one stories of a tract-like nature bearing such titles as \\"My Mother's Gold Ring\\", \\"I Am Afraid There Is A God\\", \\"Groggy Harbor\\", and \\"An Irish Heart\\", first published in separate issues between 1833 and 1843. These were widely distributed by religious and temperance societies as well as by Sargent himself. His temperance tales were translated into several languages. =Antiquarian= He also achieved prominence as an antiquarian. In 1848 he began a series of weekly articles in the Boston Evening Transcript entitled \\"Dealings with the Dead\\" (published in book form in 1856), which in spite of their name did not lack light touches. Under such pseudonyms as Sigma, Amgis, Saveall, and others, he wrote for numerous other publications, and he aroused considerable interest by attacking the coolie trade of the British in India (Evening Transcript, April 16-October 3, 1856) and by assailing Thomas Babington Macaulay for statements derogatory to William Penn (Dealings with the Dead, I, pp. 231‚Äì69). Though he showed enthusiasm for the past, his efforts were generally directed towards blasting something offensive to him out of existence. At seventy-five he published The Ballad of the Abolition Blunder-buss (1861), which abuses Ralph Waldo Emerson and others for their antislavery views as violently as his Temperance Tales do the saloonkeeper. Even one of his obituaries refers to him as a man of \\"harsh prejudices\\", though it acknowledges the urbanity of his manners in his ordinary dealings and the warmth of his attachment to his family and friends. He also wrote Reminiscences of Samuel Dexter (1858) and The Irrepressible Conflict (1861). His numerous poems were never printed in book-form. Personal life On April 3, 1816, he married Mary Binney (1786‚Äì1824), a sister of Horace Binney of Philadelphia. Her sister, Susan Binney was married to John Bradford Wallace and were the parents of Horace Binney Wallace. Before her early death, they had three children together, including: * Mary Turner Sargent (1818‚Äì1841) * Horace Binney Sargent (1821‚Äì1908), who married Elizabeth Little Swett (1822‚Äì1866) After the death of his first wife in 1824, Lucius Manlius married Sarah Cutler Dunn (1797‚Äì1868) on July 14, 1825. Their son: * Lucius Manlius Sargent, Jr. (1826‚Äì1864) Sargent died in Boston on June 2, 1867. =Descendants= His son, Horace, graduated from Harvard in 1843, and from the law school there in 1845. At the opening of the Civil War he was senior aide on the staff of Gov. John A. Andrew, was commissioned lieutenant- colonel of the 1st Regiment, Massachusetts Cavalry, in 1861, became colonel of the same regiment in October 1862, was on duty with the forces in South Carolina, in the Army of the Potomac and the Department of the Gulf, participating in the engagements of Secessionville, Culpeper, and Rapidan Station, and in the battles of Antietam, South Mountain, Chancellorsville, and in the Red River campaign under Gen. Banks, where he was wounded in action, March 21, 1864. He was brevetted brigadier general for \\"gallantry and good conduct,\\" and on September 29, 1864, was mustered out on account of wounds received in action. He was a frequent contributor to periodical literature and the press, and delivered numerous addresses. His younger son, Lucius Jr., graduated at Harvard in 1848, and at the medical school there in 1857, becoming house surgeon and dispensary physician at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He was commissioned surgeon in the 2nd Massachusetts Volunteers in May 1861, but resigned in October of that year, and became captain in the 1st Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry, was ordered to the Army of the Potomac, and participated in the battles of Kelly's Ford, Antietam, South Mountain, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. He became major in his former regiment, January 2, 1864, lieutenant colonel, September 30, and was mortally wounded in an engagement on Meherrin River. =Honors= In 1842, Harvard conferred the degree of A.M. on him, thereby recognizing his public services and condoning his undergraduate rebellion, for the violence of which he often expressed regret. He was preeminently a good hater, but he was a conspicuous man in his day and helped to develop a sentiment in favor of prohibition, besides making rather valuable contributions to local history.

Cecil is head of the Global Defense Agency, a secret U.S. government agency charged with protecting the world from planetary level threats. His most distinguishing characteristic is scarring on the lower right side of his face, the only bit of his original face skin left after a terrible accident. When his face was rebuilt, he had it left as a reminder. In Invincible #9, Cecil reestablished the Guardians of the Globe under the leadership of Robot. In Invincible #13, he offered Mark a job with the G.D.A.; the same position his father Omni-Man once held. In Invincible #36, Cecil arrested D.A. Sinclair for the crimes he committed while creating his \\"Reanimen\\" only to offer him a job with the G.D.A. to create more \\"Reanimen\\". His secret history is revealed in Invincible #50, after the falling out between him and Mark Grayson. As a young agent, Cecil was held captive by a brother-sister team of supervillains called The Order of the Freeing Fist, who were intent on sparking a revolution by using a highly corrosive gas called chemical X to destroy an entire city. The superhero Brit was sent in to stop them and rescue Cecil, but was too late to prevent the siblings from setting off the canisters of chemical X, which Cecil was tied to. In the ensuing fight, Cecil is horribly burned and loses most of his skin. A few weeks later, Brit visits a fully recovered Cecil in a hospital and Cecil tells Brit that now most of his skin is in fact artificial, and the scarring on his face was the only part of his skin that was salvageable. Cecil chose to keep it as a reminder that failure of his job got people killed. Years later, The Lizard League launches an assault on the Pentagon. Cecil and his boss (the current director of the GDA) are attacked by Komodo Dragon, only to be saved by the same villains responsible for almost killing Cecil. Cecil's boss reveals that he faked their deaths and has been using them as both bodyguards and to train an elite force, far more useful than keeping them behind bars. Cecil shows his gratitude by shooting both of them. This is witnessed by the Guardians of the Globe and Cecil is sent to Stronghold Penitentiary. Months later, Cecil's boss comes to him with an offer: replace him in the Global Defense Agency, or rot in prison. After some debate, Cecil accepts. A year later, Omni-man comes to Earth.

His successors ruled the kingdom until 1853. Origin The Bhonsale family were originally headmen from Deor or Deur under the forts Chandan Vandan ,(presently in Koregaon Taluka, District Satara and was under Deshmukhi rights of Bhoite Clan), a village in Satara District. Raghoji's grandfather and his two brothers had fought in the armies of Shivaji, and to the most distinguished of them was entrusted a high military command and the collection of chauth (tribute) in Berar.  Nagpur Kingdom  Nagpur was then the capital of a Gondwana Kingdom ruled by the Gond house of Devagad, who had moved the capital to Nagpur from Deogarh. On Raja Gond's death in 1739, there were disputes as to his succession, and his widow invoked the aid of Raghoji, who was governing Berar on behalf of the Maratha. Raghoji, on being called in by the contending Gond factions, replaced the two sons of Raja Gond on the throne from which they had been ousted by a usurper, and retired to Berar, with a suitable reward for his assistance. Dissensions, however, broke out between the brothers, and in 1743 Raghoji again intervened at the request of the elder brother and drove out his rival. But he had not the heart to give back a second time the country he held within his grasp. Burhan Shan, the Gond Raja, though allowed to retain the outward insignia of royalty, became practically a state pensioner, and all real power passed to the Marathas.

Bold and decisive in action, Raghoji was the archetype of a Maratha leader; he saw in the troubles of other states an opening for his own ambition, and did not even require a pretext for plunder and invasion. Twice his armies invaded Bengal, and he obtained the cession of Cuttack. Chanda, Chhattisgarh, and Sambalpur were added to his dominions between 1745 and 1755, the year of his death. He was succeeded by Janoji Bhonsle. Battle of Damalcherry Dost Ali Khan ordered Chanda Sahib to march against the Rajah of Tirusivapuram. There upon the Rajah invited the assistance of the Maratha Empire. Soon afterwards took place the battle of Damalcherry, which was a major confrontation between the Mughal Empire's Nawab of the Carnatic, Dost Ali Khan and his Maratha opponent Raghoji I Bhonsale. The battle concluded with the fall of Dost Ali Khan and three years of Maratha occupation in the Carnatic. Expeditions in Bengal The Expeditions in Bengal was taken by the Maratha Empire after the successful campaign in Carnatic at the Battle of Trichinopolly. The leader of the expedition was Maratha Maharaja Raghuji of Nagpur. Raghoji was able to annex Orissa and parts of Bengal permanently as he successfully exploited the chaotic conditions prevailing in the region after the death of their Governor Murshid Quli Khan in 1727.SNHM.

In 2007, it received its exempt organization status from the IRS and now brings in $348,750 in annual inc that focuses on the issues of right to work, education reform, balanced budget amendment, judicial reform, and tax reform. Organization The Adam Smith Foundation was formed as a nonprofit corporation in the State of Missouri on February 21, 2007. Jo Mannies, in a blog entry in the St. Louis Post Dispatch, noted that the organization was founded by a group of Missouri Republican activists.

This process is known as the \\"Missouri Nonpartisan Court Plan,\\"Missouri Nonpartisan Court Plan Your Missouri Courts and the Missouri Plan. Shortly after its launch the Foundation sponsored a series of radio adsMissourinet: Quiet Process of Choosing Supreme Court Judge Anything But and billboards critical of the Missouri Plan method for the nonpartisan selection of judges. =Right to Work= The Adam Smith Foundation supports \\"Right to Work,\\" the principle that employees should not be forced to join unions or to pay union dues. = Tax Reform = The Adam Smith Foundation believes in low taxes and making sure that the government lives within its means. In an Op-Ed piece published in the Southeast Missourian, John Elliott, the President of the Adam Smith Foundation, argued that the recent state surplus should be given back to the public either through tax cuts or through a large refund.John Elliott. \\"Excessive Tax Haul Belongs to the People.\\" Southeast Missourian July 21, 2007.

The organization's former Secretary, Tom Shupe, wrote, \\"Why not focus on making the existing system better by letting doctors and other health care professionals, not politicians, tell us what works?\\" In 2010, the Foundation attracted attention by contributing nearly half a million dollars to California's Proposition 23 effort, which would have suspended stricter greenhouse gas emissions standards until California's unemployment rate dropped below 5.5% for a full year. The Foundation's Executive Director said that the Foundation contributed to the effort over fears that stricter air quality standards in California would affect Missouri, remarking, \\"Craziness out in California will have an impact here in Missouri.\\" In 2013, the Foundation was opposed to efforts that would have changed franchise law in Missouri to protect one company's market share. Criticism =Involvement with California's Proposition 23= The Adam Smith Foundation's contribution of $498,000 in support of California's Proposition 23 led to questions from members of the press.

Biography  Charles Downing was born in Newburgh, New York on July 9, 1802. He began helping his father, Samuel Downing, with his nursery business when he was a teen. In 1822, his father died and Downing took over the business, later partnering with his brother, Andrew Jackson Downing, in 1835. The partnership lasted until 1839 when Charles sold his interest to start his own business. As a nurseryman, Downing was known for his cultivation skill and trustworthiness. Published in 1845, he worked with his brother to write The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America. After Andrew's death in 1852, Downing edited and added new material and reissued The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America. Each new edition greatly enlarged the book and it was the best publication of the kind in the United States. In 1850, left his nursery and began to research and experiment with fruit varieties. His test orchard contained 1,800 varieties of apples and 1,000 varieties of pears. He also worked with cultivating a variety of grapes in New York state. He was regarded as one of the foremost pomologists of his day. He also wrote many articles upon horticultural subjects under the initials \\"C. D.\\" His work throughout was conscientious and accurate, and he was internationally recognized as an authority upon pomology, horticulture, and tree growths. Quiet, modest, and retiring, although an active member of horticultural societies, he would never make a public speech. In 1870, Downing traveled with Marshall P. Wilder, Patrick Barry, and George Ellwanger to California and published about their journey in Tilton's Journal. The California Farmer and Journal of Useful Sciences printed their report in seven articles. Their report transformed the horticultural landscape through the realization of the optimal growing conditions, vast acreage, large fruits, and exotic plants of California.  Death and legacy  While in New York City in 1883, Downing was knocked down and run over by a horsecar. He never completely recovered from the injuries he received and died two years later on January 18, 1885. He was married to Mary Wait, daughter of Samuel Wait of Montgomery, New York.

Rocky heads to the weather bureau and meets up with now-meteorologist Captain Peachfuzz. Bullwinkle is appointed the island's wizard, but he quickly proves to be a terrible one. The three heroes will be burned at the stake unless they find the Oogle Bird. Controversy This story arc attracted the ire of the network. ABC objected to the heroes being burned at the stake, claiming this was tantamount to cannibalism. Jay Ward humorously noted the difference between humans and moose & squirrels, and the story was allowed to continue. This is reflected in the Narrator's comment: \\"While the network-approved flames climbed higher and higher...\\" This would later resurface in a joke in the Season 5 story arc involving the Bumbling Brothers Circus, in which an Indian has Rocky tied to a stake and plans to set fire to it. Rocky interjects that the network says what he is doing is wrong. However, the Indian claim that they are merely 'roasting' Rocky, and that makes the situation ok.

Based on Magellan radar images. The surface of Venus is dominated by volcanic features and has more volcanoes than any other planet in the Solar System. It has a surface that is 90% basalt, and about 65% of the planet consists of a mosaic of volcanic lava plains, indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. There are more than 1,000 volcanic structures and possible periodic resurfacing of Venus by floods of lava. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Venus has an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, with a density that is 90 times greater than Earth's atmosphere. Even though there are over 1,600 major volcanoes on Venus, none are known to be erupting at present and most are probably long extinct.Volcanoes on Venus Retrieved on 2007-08-18 However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank. Although many lines of evidence suggest that Venus is likely to be volcanically active, present-day eruptions at Maat Mons have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, other more recent studies, in January 2020, suggests Venus is currently volcanically active.  Types of volcanoes  Venus has shield volcanoes, widespread lava flows and some unusual volcanoes called pancake domes and \\"tick-like\\" structures which are not present on Earth. Pancake dome volcanoes are up to in diameter and less than in height and are 100 times larger than those formed on Earth. They are usually associated with coronae and tesserae (large regions of highly deformed terrain, folded and fractured in two or three dimensions, are unique to Venus). The pancakes are thought to be formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure. Radar mosaic of two wide (and less than high) pancake domes in Venus's Eistla region The \\"tick-like\\" structures are called scalloped margin domes. They are commonly called ticks because they appear as domes with numerous legs. They are thought to have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. Sometimes deposits of debris can be seen scattered around them. Computer-generated perspective view of pancake domes in Venus's Alpha Regio On Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes. The shield volcanoes, for example those in Hawaii, eject magma from the depths of the Earth in zones called hot spots. The lava from these volcanos is relatively fluid and permits the escape of gases. Composite volcanos, such as Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates. In this type of volcano, the oceanic crust of one plate is sliding underneath the other in a subduction zone, together with an inflow of seawater, producing a gummier lava that restricts the exit of the gases, and for that reason, composite volcanoes tend to erupt more violently. thumbleft241 pxArachnoid surface feature on Venus On Venus, where there are no tectonic plates or seawater, volcanoes are mostly of the shield type . Nevertheless, the morphology of volcanoes on Venus is different: on Earth, shield volcanoes can be a few tens of kilometres wide and up to high in the case of Mauna Kea, measured from the sea floor. On Venus, these volcanoes can cover hundreds of kilometres in area, but they are relatively flat, with an average height of . Large volcanoes cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward because of their enormous vertical loads, producing flexural moats and/or ring fractures around the edifices.[McGovern and Solomon, 1998] Large volcano edifice loading also causes magma chambers to fracture in a sill-like pattern, affecting magma propagation beneath the surface. Other unique features of Venus's surface are novae (radial networks of dikes or grabens) and arachnoids. A nova is formed when large quantities of magma are extruded onto the surface to form radiating ridges and trenches which are highly reflective to radar. These dikes form a symmetrical network around the central point where the lava emerged, where there may also be a depression caused by the collapse of the magma chamber. Arachnoids are so named because they resemble a spider's web, featuring several concentric ovals surrounded by a complex network of radial fractures similar to those of a nova. It is not known whether the 250 or so features identified as arachnoids actually share a common origin, or are the result of different geological processes.A New Episode of Volcanism on Venus. ESA: Science and technology. December 2, 2012  Recent volcanic activity  Volcanism on Venus has taken place within the last 2.5 million years; however, there is no absolute proof that any volcano on Venus has erupted recently. Recent radar imagery shows more than 1,000 volcanic structures and evidence of possible periodic resurfacing of the planet by floods of lava. In addition to the radar images, there is supporting evidence that volcanism has taken place, including an unusual change in the amount of sulphur dioxide gas in the upper atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide is an important component of volcanic outgassing. However, the sulphur dioxide in the lower atmosphere remains stable. This could mean that a change in the global atmosphere caused the sulphur dioxide concentration to increase above the clouds. Even though the change in the atmosphere may be evidence that there have been volcanoes that erupted in Venus, it is difficult to determine whether they occurred or not. In March 2014, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was located, in the form of infrared \\"flashes\\" over the edges of rift zone Ganis Chasma, near the shield volcano Sapas Mons. These flashes were detectable during two or three consequent Earth days in 2008 and 2009 and are thought to be caused either by hot gases or lava released from volcanic eruptions. Scientists suspect that there are three volcanoes that may be active: Maat Mons, Ozza Mons and Sapas Mons.Venus Volcano Watch. Mattei, M. F.

In 2020, a study by University of Maryland supported by Swiss National Science Foundation and NASA discovered that 37 of Venus coronae show signs of ongoing activity. Maryland professor Laurent Montesi said, \\"we are able to point to specific structures and say ‚ÄòLook, this is not an ancient volcano but one that is active today, dormant perhaps, but not dead...\\" The active coronae are clustered near each other, so positioning geologic survey instruments would now be easier. =Lightning= Lightning on Venus may serve as a diagnostic of volcanism or atmospheric convection, so some effort has been devoted to detecting possible lightning on Venus.Lightning detection on Venus: a critical review.

It is the eastern two-thirds of the Ganges and Brahmaputra river delta plain stretching to the north from the Bay of Bengal. There are two small areas of slightly higher land in the north-centre and north-west composed of old alluvium called the Madhupur Tract and the Barind Tract, and steep, folded, hill ranges of older (Tertiary) rocks along the eastern border. The downwarping of the basement rocks under central and southern Bangladesh result from the pressure of sediments that have been accumulating since the Cretaceous period, mostly a large quantity of carbonate. In the Late Eocene epoch the conditions in the Bay of Bengal changed and these deposits ceased. Structural and tectonic geology In the late Cretaceous, the Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate, after the Indian and African Plate split to form the Indian Ocean during the Triassic. The tectonic collision in the Cretaceous separated the Gulf of Assam and the Gulf of Burma, while narrow channels from the ocean fed water into the two gulfs. As ridges formed in the Tethys Ocean on the other side of the Shillong and Dinajpur Shields, small island arcs formed locally. The Tura sandstone, Sylhet limestone and Kopili shale were all deposited during an intermediate shall marine depositional environment in between these tectonic changes. A renewed period of collision and tectonic activity began with the Himalayan orogeny in the Eocene. The gulfs became shallower and the east-west Sylhet strike affected sedimentary rocks along with the Bogra strike. As tectonic activity slowed somewhat, a river delta environment deposited of the other significant Cenozoic sedimentary units. Renewed tectonism in the Pliocene formed the Dinajpur Shield into a graben, relative to the horst of the Shillong Plateau and Mikir Hills. The Pliocene orogeny led into the Pleistocene ice age, resulting in regional extinction of many large mammals. A final period of uplift raised the red clay table lad 30 to 100 feet, along with St. Martin's Island in the Pleistocene. Geologic history Surface rocks and stratigraphy in Bangladesh were formed during the Cenozoic and rock units date to all epochs of the Cenozoic except for the Oligocene, which is poorly preserved. Drilling and mineral prospecting has revealed deeper rock units that record the geologic history of Bangladesh prior to the Cenozoic as far back as the Precambrian. =Precambrian= Two wells, drilled in 1959 and 1960 in search of oil by the Standard Vacuum Oil Company near Kuchma and in the northern Bogra district first revealed Precambrian rocks beneath Bangladesh. The Precambrian Basement Complex is composed of gneiss, granite, granodiorite and smaller sequences of schistose, amiphibolite and gabbro. Precambrian rocks are preserved in northwest Bangladesh as the Dinajpur Platform and Dinajpur Shield. The Dinajpur Platform is contiguous with the Indian Shield while a graben and faulting along the Ganges and Jamuna separates the Dinajpur Shield from the Shillong and Chhotonagpur plateaus. =Paleozoic= In the Permian period, Bangladesh was part of the supercontinent Gondwana. The existence of Gondwana was first theorized by Rupert Jones, a European coal mine operator who in 1829 published a hypothesis about coal fields beneath Bangladesh. Gondwana came into use in the 1870s, named after the Gond people. The Kuchma formation preserves the early Permian, with a sequence of sandstone, shaly sandstone, black carbonaceous shale and white sandstone. These sediments are highly porous and hold extensive water reserves, but because of their depth are highly saline and poor quality for agriculture. The late Permian Paharpur formation was first recognized through 11 boreholes in 1965 near the Paharpur coal field. The formation is primarily gray, feldspathic sandstone and some deposits of kaolin material. =Mesozoic= The Late Jurassic Rajmahal formation differs from other primarily sedimentary sequences, with hornblende basalt, olivine basalt and andesite as well as associated ash beds, tuff and agglomerate and small one meter thick sedimentary bed which preserve fossilized plants. The early Cretaceous Sibganj formation includes white kaolinite sandstone, iron-rich trapwash sandstone, red shale, claystone, clay, tuff, and sedimentary beds fossilized plants. Ostracod fossils were used to establish its age. =Cenozoic= The Tura sandstone is a very thick unit, formed during the early and middle Cenozoic. It is named after the Tura range in the Tura district. Very little of the sandstone is visible at the surface. It forms three small hills at Takerghat, although these are blanketed in alluvium. A small pillar in Lalghat and an exposure by a stream are the only places where the Tura sandstone is visible. Early efforts to date the sandstone with microfossils in the 1960s failed but other researchers had better luck with pollen. The Sylhet limestone preserves additional rock units such as shale and sandstone, indicative of a shallow marine environment and contains 69 species of foraminifera, while the Upper Eocene Kopili formation contains pollen from mangrove swamps. Oligocene units like the Burdwaran formation and Memari formation show signs of ocean transgression, and an estuarine environment. Stratigraphy The stratigraphy of Bangladesh begins with Precambrian units below ground. Geologists have found an unconformity between Precambrian and Paleozoic units. Gondwanan sedimentary units, including the early Permian Kuchma and late Permian Paharpur range between 494 meters and 1.2 kilometers in thickness. Ascending the stratigraphic column, a second unconformity separates Permian units from late Jurassic Rajmahal basalts and early Cretaceous Sibganj sedimentary rocks, with thicknesses between 131 and 546 meters. The late Cretaceous is absent due to an unconformity. The coal, limestone and shale-laden Tura sandstone, deposited from the Paleocene to the Eocene is 377 meters thick, and lies beneath the middle Eocene Sylhet limestone and late Eocene Kopili shale. An additional unconformity separates Eocene and Oligocene Jennum and Renji sanstone and shale sequences, which are 646 meters in thickness. Lower Bhuban, Middle Bhuban, Upper Bhuban and Boka Bil are ascending units of early Micoense siltstone and sandstone, which give way to the middle Miocene Tipam Sandstone and Girujan Clay. An unconformity occurs before late Miocene sequences including the Dupi Tila sandstone and claystone, with another unconformity between the Dupi Tila units and Pliocene Dihing claysone and silty sandstone. Pleistocene St. Martin's limestone and Madhapur clay are separated from Pliocene units by an unconformity as well from Holocene sand, silt, clay, peat and coral alluvium. History of geologic research The Geological Survey of India did not focus much on geological mapping in Bengal during the British Raj. The Geological Survey of Pakistan, when Bangladesh was East Pakistan focused on searching for mineral deposits and the Bengali government has continued that pattern. Compared to many countries, the geology of Bangladesh is poorly mapped and understood. Natural resource geology Most natural resources in Bangladesh have been discovered since independence from Britain, many in the 1950s and 1980s. Geologists found deltaic peat deposits in 1953, the St. Martin limestone in 1958, coal, glass-quality sand and the Takerghat limestone in 1959 as well as additional coal, limestone, kaolin and sand along with Precambrian rocks in the Rajshahi Division from 1963 to 1982. Thirteen gas fields and an oil field were discovered between 1959 and 1987.

The crimes On November 1, 1987, Steven Oken, then 25, murdered Dawn Marie Garvin (nee Romano). She was found by her father on the bed in her White Marsh apartment, naked, with a condiment bottle protruding from her vagina and blood streaming from her forehead. Despite efforts of her father and paramedics to administer CPR, she was dead. An autopsy later revealed that she had died as the result of two contact gunshot wounds; one of the bullets entered at her left eyebrow and the other at her right ear. Less than two weeks after Oken murdered Dawn Garvin, he sexually assaulted and murdered his sister-in-law, Patricia Hirt, at his White Marsh townhouse, dumping her body along White Marsh Boulevard. He then fled to Kittery, Maine, where he murdered Lori Ward, the desk clerk at the motel in which he was staying. He was arrested in Maine on November 17, 1987, and was ultimately convicted and sentenced to life without parole in Maine for the first-degree murder of Ward. Oken was then returned to Maryland where he faced separate prosecutions for charges arising out of the other two murders. Trial and execution Oken was found guilty and sentenced to die for the killing of Dawn Garvin on January 18, 1991. Following his conviction for Garvin's murder Oken pleaded guilty to killing Patricia Hirt, and received an additional life sentence.

He played college football at Trinity University. Logan, whose nickname was \\"The Little O\\", was the last person in the NFL to wear the single digit 0 before its use was discontinued by the league. Early years Obert attended Gonzales High School, where he competed in football, basketball, baseball and track. Originally recruited to Trinity University as a defensive back, he was the best athlete on the team, so his coaches persuaded him to play both ways. He was a four year starter, playing defensive back, flanker and halfback. In his first 2 seasons he led the team in rushing and in his last 2 years he led them in receiving. As a senior, he set a school and Southland Conference record with 11 receiving touchdowns. He set a school mark with an 81 yard run against Southwest Texas State College. He set a school record with a 79 yard reception against McMurry University. He also set school marks with 23 kickoff returns for 465 yards. He finished his college career with 33 kickoff returns (school record) for 690 kickoff return yards (school record). He received honorable-mention Little All-American honors as a senior, was a three-time member of the All-Texas team and a three- time All-Southland Conference selection. He also practiced basketball, baseball and track. In 1999, he was inducted into the Trinity University Hall of Fame. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys (first stint)= Logan was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1965 NFL Draft. The team tried him first at flanker, before moving him to safety, where he would end up surprising observers by making the Cowboys opening day roster for the 1965 season. As a rookie, he was a reserve playing behind Mel Renfro, until the fifth game when he was named the starter at free safety. Early in his first season, he forced a kickoff fumble that resulted in a touchdown. One of his 3 interceptions came against the Philadelphia Eagles, when he picked off a Norm Snead goal-line pass with two minutes left to secure a 21-19 win. Against the San Francisco 49ers, Larry Stephens blocked a field goal that Logan returned to the Cowboys 47-yard line, helping the Cowboys set up a last minute touchdown to end a 5-game losing streak. In the last game of the season against the New York Giants, he returned a blocked field goal by Cornell Green 60 yards for a key touchdown, helping his team win the game, complete the first non-losing season in franchise history and advance to the Playoff Bowl. In 1965, he was a key member of the special teams unit which blocked nine field goals (three times as many as other team in the NFL and Logan blocked two of those), 5 extra points and 1 punt, totaling 15 kicks blocked. In 1966, between Renfro being switched to the offense and also experiencing some injuries, Logan was able to start in 6 games and finished with 2 interceptions. He also played in the 1967 NFL Championship Game (commonly known as the Ice Bowl). Logan was small for an NFL player, being and while listed at 182 pounds, appeared to weigh closer to 160. He also possessed good but not overwhelming speed. What set him apart was tremendous courage and a full out style of play that gave evidence of his knowledge and love for the game. =New Orleans Saints= Logan was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the 1967 NFL Expansion Draft, becoming the franchise's first starting free safety. He was released on August 25, 1968. =Dallas Cowboys (second stint)= On August 28, 1968, he was claimed by the Dallas Cowboys. On September 4, he was released and later signed to the taxi squad, where he spent the rest of the season. On August 30, 1969, he was released after being tried out as a flanker. He would spend his last 2 years of professional football in the Texas Football League. Personal life Logan was well liked and respected by his teammates and his courage and attitude toward the game. After the NFL, Logan spent one season as an assistant player-coach for the San Antonio Toros of the Continental Football League. He then held the same position for one year the Fort Worth Braves of the Texas Football League, which was serving as a farm club for the Kansas City Chiefs. He was trying his hand in the rodeo business as a rancher, when he accepted the Athletic Director and his last coaching job for the St. Paul Cardinals of Shiner, Texas. He contracted colon cancer and died in Luling, Texas at his home at the age of 61 on January 21, 2003. He would often tell friends that the most memorable thing about playing football for the Cowboys was Coach Tom Landry. Logan remembered that the first thing Landry told the rookies at training camp was that his priorities were \\"God, family and the Dallas Cowboys\\". He recalled being surprised that football was not Landry's first priority. At his funeral many of his Cowboy's teammates served as his pall bearers, among them were Lee Roy Jordan, Walt Garrison, Bob Lilly, Don Meredith, and Tex Schramm. Logan had maintained lifelong friendships with all of these men. After his death Cowboy great Lee Roy Jordan said of him, \\"Obert was just a nice guy. I loved being around him. He was undersized and under-everything else but he proved right away that he was a great competitor. He represented the Dallas Cowboys well\\". Logan was survived by his mother Fannie Mae Logan, wife Patricia, and brother James.

Its goal is to find out a logging method that best balances the demand for wood products with forest preservation. Researchers from the Missouri Department of Conservation, the U.S. Forest Service, and Missouri universities are participating in the project. The project uses of state forest land as experimental tracts. That land is divided into nine compartments. One group of three compartments is a control group and experiences no logging. The second group is logged in an \\"even-aged\\" manner, with swaths comprising ten percent of each compartment logged every ten years. The third group is logged in an \\"uneven-aged\\" manner, with selective logging of trees throughout the three compartments in that group. The uneven-aged management style creates a forest with trees of various ages and sizes. In the two groups that are cut, 10% of trees are left uncut, to preserve them as old growth forest. In both groups, researchers expect all tracts of cut forest to regenerate by the end of the project. The uncut control group, of course, remains unaffected. The project has spawned twelve studies to assess the flora and fauna of the forest as it reacts to various logging methods. Although the project only started in 1995, researchers have already released some preliminary results of the study. The project's expected completion date is 2095.

It was broadcast on the NBC network during the 1963‚Äì1964 television season. Summary When two scouts see Bullwinkle tossing Rocky, Rocky and Bullwinkle are offered scholarships to Wossamotta U., a school with a dreadful football record. Bullwinkle's passing skills enable Wossamotta to consistently win, so Boris concocts the fiendish plan of having his team of brutal thugs and murderers, the Mud City Manglers (coached by Fearless Leader), compete ‚Äî disguised as girls. Since the latter are certain to lose, Boris can safely bet the Pottsylvania treasury on their winning, and rake in a fortune at 200:1 odds. The Big Game is played following Civil War (\\"Tha's War between the States!\\") battle plans, and proceed to play on until Bullwinkle scores the decisive touchdown to presumably win the game. Even moreso than other Rocky and Bullwinkle episodes, this story arc contains numerous editing errors and inconsistencies, including a final score that actually left Mud City ahead by a single point; the show's dialogue made it clear that Wossamotta was the intended winner. The dialog includes one of the series' most memorable exchanges.

Fuidge were Thomas's first cousins, once removed.Grazebrook and Rylands Part I, p.77-8 However, Thomas Bromley's own beginnings were not auspicious, as his family was a cadet branch of a then relatively minor family. The dates of his legal training suggest he was born in the early years of the 16th century, probably at the Shropshire home of his parents. He was the second son of :* Roger Bromley, third son of Roger Bromley of Mitley, Shropshire :* Jane Jennings, daughter of Thomas Jennings of Walliborne Hall, Church Pulverbatch. =Family tree: the Bromley dynasty= The relationship between the Bromley politicians and lawyers of the 16th century, and between them and their allies in the Hill, Corbet and Newport families, is illustrated in the family tree Family tree: the Bromleys and their allies, c.1450‚Äì1650 Based primarily on the Heraldic Visitations of Shropshire and Cheshire, with assistance from the History of Parliament Online. Legal training The Bromleys were already involved with the Law. George Bromley, Thomas's elder cousin, was an important member of the Inner Temple and had been appointed Autumn Reader for 1508Inderwick, p.11 and Lent Reader for 1509,Inderwick, p.12 although he recused himself when so honoured for Lent 1515.Inderwick, p.35 The first evidence of Thomas Bromley's legal career dates from May 1519, when he was suspended by the parliament of the Inner Temple for offensive behaviour toward the chief governor: :‚ÄúOrder that Widdon and Brumley, the younger, be sent out of commons because they evilly behaved themselves towards Master Sutton, the chief governor, at the time of the last vacation.‚ÄùInderwick, p.46 His penitence was duly recorded in the Law French still widely employed by lawyers at the time: :‚ÄúThomas Bromele permitte et graunte all compeney de le Inner Tempell de paier mes commons et auteres duetes en le dit Tempell, et de etre goveryn et redresse par les governers et par le dit compeney, et de obaier et performer totes maners ordnaunces de le compeney de le dit Tempell, sur payne detre oust a tous jourz. Pleg, John Whiddon, Thomas Newton‚ÄùInderwick, p.47 This was followed by a similar undertaking from Whiddon. Despite his \\"youthful indiscretion,\\" Bromley rose fairly quickly to positions of trust and responsibility at the Inn, while presumably making a living primarily from private practice and, increasingly, public appointments to judicial posts. In 1526 the parliament of the Inn appointed him one of the auditors for the building of a wall by the River Thames.Inderwick, p.85-86 In November 1528, as Whiddon, his former accomplice, was reappointed Reader for the following Lent, Bromley was appointed as one of the auditors to the Treasurer of the Inner Temple.Inderwick, p.91 After attending the Lent Reader for two successive years,Inderwick, p.99Inderwick, p.101 in May 1533 Bromley was at last elected Reader for the following autumn.Inderwick, p.102 By February 1534 his standing was such that the Inn admitted one William Walter on his recommendation, free of all charges apart from the cost of his wine.Inderwick, p.110 In June 1539 Bromley was appointed serjeant-at-law by Henry VIII. He was immediately declared the next Autumn Reader, as was the custom. The records of the Inner Temple show that he refused the honour and was fined ¬£10.Inderwick, p.123 However the entry recording this is crossed out, and it is not recorded whether Bromley retracted and performed the office or was pardoned. In November 1539, he was appointed Reader for Lent 1540, but two others were nominated as reserves.Inderwick, p.124 All three were honoured in this way in recognition of their appointment as serjeants-at-law. In the event, Bromley did not lecture for the full term but was replaced by one of his attendants after the second week, :\\"in consideracion that it apperyd suche debylete in the seyde Thomas Bromley that he was not lyke too have keppyd owte the hole redyng in the seyde vacacion of Lente.\\"Inderwick, p.125 The precise nature of his \\"debility\\" is unknown but it appears to have affected him often.

It seems that Cromwell's distrust acted as a brake on Bromley's career. His judicial promotion and property speculation both forged ahead as Cromwell's power came to an end. It seems likely that Bromley served as an MP in the English Reformation Parliament of 1529‚Äì36. This was first suggested by the historian Albert Pollard. The History of Parliament Online suggests that he might even have served in the succeeding parliaments, a view made plausible by the scantiness of records on the identity of members. The main evidence for his sitting in the English House of Commons is a list of MPs drawn up by Thomas Cromwell, the powerful chief minister and parliamentary fixer of Henry VIII, in 1533. It is headed by Sir George Throckmorton, a prominent religious conservative, and those on it were either of similar opinions or heavily committed to the wool trade, both groups being generally opposed to a break with the Papacy.Bindoff: Appendix VII: Members opposed to a bill in 1533 ‚Äì Author: S. T. Bindoff Hence it probably lists those likely to oppose the Statute in Restraint of Appeals, a key piece of Reformation legislation. Bromley is listed twice: an entry near the head has been crossed out and he is named again at the foot of the list. His presence on the list means that he had displeased Cromwell. It is also fairly certain evidence that he did sit as an MP for at least some of the parliament after being returned in a by-election. His constituency is unknown but Lostwithiel and Lancaster have been suggested. = A local power base= However, Parliament was not to be the main theatre of Bromley's political life. His own native county offered opportunities for gaining political advantage. As there was no resident aristocracy, the Shropshire gentry were the main power in the county and also exercised considerable influence in the cloth town of Shrewsbury, where merchants and lawyers ruled.Coulton, p.40 Once again, his cousin George had beaten the path, becoming Recorder of Shrewsbury and High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1522.Grazebrook and Rylands Part I, p.78 Thomas Bromley secured the freedom of Shrewsbury in 1528 and in 1529 admission to the Drapers' Company of Shrewsbury. Chartered by Edward IV in 1461,Coulton, p.19 it was one of the two guilds that dominated this cloth town (the other being the Mercers).Bindoff: Shrewsbury ‚Äì Author: N. M. Fuidge Around 1532 he became Warden of the Company, and at about the same time he was made an alderman ‚Äì one of the council of 12 that assisted the two bailiffs in running the town.Coulton, p.17 ‚Äì a post he was to hold until his death. In 1536 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace in Shropshire. By 1537 he had been appointed Recorder of Shrewsbury: its senior legal and judicial officer. As this carried a heavy responsibility for representing the interests of the town in London, it fitted well with his activities at the Inner Temple, requiring him to spend only a little time in Shrewsbury itself. Bromley was a close friend of Rowland Hill, who was an uncle of George Bromley. Hill's career ran parallel to Bromley's but with even greater success, pairing a regional power base in Shropshire with a spectacular career as a mercer in London: by 1541, the year before he was knighted, he was paying at least 5000 marks a year in tax and in 1549 became the first Protestant Mayor of London.Bindoff: HILL, Sir Rowland (by 1498‚Äì1561), of London and Hodnet, Salop. ‚Äì Author: Helen Miller Between 1539 and 1547, Hill invested a substantial part of his commercial wealth in great quantities of landed property in Shropshire and the neighbouring counties that had been made available by the dissolution of the monasteriesBaugh and Elrington (1989): Domesday Book: 1540‚Äì1750 or the abolition of chantries and colleges. Bromley speculated in some of Hill's deals and, like other prominent lawyers, built up considerable estates in his native county, including land at Wroxeter, which became his seat. Among properties he purchased in the area were Eyton on Severn and Aston, both manors formerly belonging to Shrewsbury Abbey. On its sale to Bromley by the Crown in 1540, Aston was attached as a member of Eyton and was passed on along with it to his heirs.Baugh and Elrington (1985): Wellington: Manors and other estates Similarly, near Stanton Long, he bought Oxenbold, partly in the parish of Monkhopton, and a former manor of Wenlock Priory, from John Jennings,Currie: Monkhopton and in 1545 added to it the neighbouring estate of Patton.Currie: Stanton Long As his status nationally rose through judicial preferment, Bromley was able to shift and consolidate his regional power. He became a Justice of the Peace in the Marcher counties of Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire during 1540‚Äì1. At the succession of Edward VI his importance in government reached a stage where the recordership of Shrewsbury was no longer appropriate and he relinquished it to Reginald Corbet, another Hill ally. By this time he had been appointed Custos Rotulorum of Shropshire, the senior post in the county's civil government. By 1552 he had joined the Council in the Marches, the regional representative of central government in much of Wales and the border counties. =Judicial promotion= From 1534 Bromley was Justice in Eyre for South Wales. At about the same time, Thomas Cromwell installed Rowland Lee, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, as Lord President of the Council in the Marches of Wales.Jones, p.63 Lee was a ruthless reformer, determined to stamp out corruption and to establish a reputation for the organs of justice in his region. Seeing Bromley as a natural ally, he wrote to Cromwell in 1536 and 1537, recommending him for promotion. Lee was the former tutor of Cromwell's children and had considerable influence with him but could not win his support for Bromley, so his continued preferment came only with the loosening of Cromwell's grip on power. Bromley received his call to the coif, i.e. his writ to become a serjeant-at-law, in the summer of 1539, although it was not to take effect until the day after the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, i.e. 25 June, in 1540. Significantly, another Inner Templar so-honoured at the same time was William Coningsby, an older lawyer who had also earned the hostility of Cromwell and had recently spent ten days in prison.Bindoff: CONINGSBY, William (by 1483‚Äì1540), of the Inner Temple, London and Lynn, Norf. ‚Äì Author: Roger Virgoe The parliament of the Inner Temple decreed a traditional ceremony of leave-taking for them. :\\"Memorandum that att this parlement it is orderyd that Master Conysby and Master Bromley, wiche procedit serjant crastino Johannis, shall have, every off them, fyve pounde and a pere off glovys off iijd., accordynge too the ancient use, wiche wer delyveryd unto them, etc., att ther departynges att the hall dore of Temple, after ther proposission and leve takyn att the fyer.\\"Inderwick, p.127 Coningsby was dead within three-month but Bromley was promoted still further, to King's Serjeant, by November of the same year. He was made Justice of the Peace across five more Midland counties and in Norfolk and Suffolk, his responsibilities now literally spanning the country. On 4 November 1544 he succeeded Sir John Spelman as a judge of the King's Bench.Foss, p.356 =The years of power= Sir Edward Montagu. He was browbeaten into approving the succession of Lady Jane Grey, along with Bromley. Edward Foss, the judicial biographer, contrasts their respective treatment by Queen Mary. Bromley was held in favour by Henry VIII, who made him one of the executors of his will, and bequeathed him a legacy of ¬£300. Hence he was one of the council of regency to Edward VI and a Privy Counsellor; but, although he succeeded in avoiding political entanglements for some time, at the close of the reign he became implicated in Northumberland's scheme for the succession of Lady Jane Grey. The duke summoned to court Montagu, chief justice of the common pleas, Bromley, Sir John Baker, and the attorney- and solicitor-general, and informed them of the king's desire to settle the crown on Lady Jane. They replied that it would be illegal, and prayed an adjournment, and next day expressed an opinion that all parties to such a settlement would be guilty of high treason. Northumberland's violence then became so great that both Bromley and Montagu were in bodily fear; and two days later, when a similar scene took place, and the king ordered them on their allegiance to despatch the matter, they consented to settle the deed, receiving an express commission under the great seal to do so and a general pardon. Bromley, however, adroitly avoided witnessing the deed. Consequently, when Mary sent the lord chief justice to gaol, she made Bromley chief justice of the King's Bench, in place of Sir Roger Cholmeley, on 4 October 1553. Burnet says of him that he was 'a papist at heart,'Burnet, p.384 contrasting his treatment with that of Montagu, who was imprisoned and fined, although he had sent an armed force to support Mary's uprising. The statement is repeated by FossFoss, p.357 and by the Dictionary of National Biography (DNB), but it is pointedly absent from the recent Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and is specifically contradicted by the History of Parliament. =Fall from favour?= Tomb of Thomas Bromley and Isabel Lyster, Wroxeter. Effigies of Thomas Bromley and his wife, Isabel Lyster, Wroxeter, Shropshire. Bromley presided over the trials of a number of those implicated in Wyatt's rebellion. On 17 April 1554 Sir Nicholas Throckmorton and others were indicted for a plot and treason at Baynard's Castle on 23 November 1553, and for a rising and march towards London with Sir Henry Isley and two thousand men. Bromley presided at the trial, and allowed the prisoner such unusual freedom of speech as to provoke complaints from the queen's attorney, and threats of retiring from the prosecution. Yet Bromley was not throughout impartial, but even refused the prisoner leave to call a witness, though he was in court, and denied him inspection of a statute on which he relied. His summing up was so defective, 'for want of memory or goodwill,' that the prisoner supplied its defects, as if he had been an uninterested spectator. Yet the prisoner was acquitted: so much to Mary's annoyance that the jury were punished for their verdict. Foss comments that \\"Sir Thomas Bromley cannot escape from the charge of undue severity, though probably he was complained of at the time for giving too great license to the prisoner.\\"Foss, p.358 Sir William Portman succeeded Bromley as chief justice on 11 June 1555. The exact date, even the year, of Bromley's death was not known when the DNB account of his life was written, leaving the impression that the Queen's displeasure might have led to his disgrace and dismissal. However, recent sources concur in dating his about four before Portman's succession, making this supposition unnecessary. Death Bromley's death occurred on 15 May 1555. In his will, admittedly dating from 1552, in the reign of Edward VI, he names as executors his wife and Sir Rowland Hill, his friend and business partner, a noted Protestant. He commends himself to God's care, \\"by the merits of the blood and passion of our Saviour Jesu Christ\\" and there are no specifically Catholic provisions, undermining Burnet's assessment of his religious beliefs. He left considerable sums to provide for the poor in and around Shrewsbury. He left just a gold piece for Hill as a keepsake of the \\"olde love and amytie\\" between them. There were also bequests to relatives, including 40 shillings a year for ten years for the young Thomas Bromley, the future Lord Chancellor, on condition that he continued his legal studies. The remainder was divided between his widow and daughter. Bromley was buried in St Andrew's Church, Wroxeter. An alabaster monument was constructed there, portraying him in judicial robes alongside his wife. Marriages and family Margaret, daughter of Thomas Bromley and his wife, Isabel Lyster, portrayed on the Bromley tomb, Wroxeter. Arms of Thomas Bromley impaled with those of his wife, Isabel Lyster. The Visitation of Shropshire gives Elizabeth Dodd as Bromley's first wife. She was the daughter of John Dodd of Chorley, also given as Cloverley, which is a short distance south-east of Calverhall in north Shropshire. Nothing further is known of the marriage and some sources question its existence. By 1526 he was married to Isabel Lyster or Lister, daughter of Richard Lyster of Rowton, Shropshire. She survived him and acted as an executor of his will, inheriting half of his residual property. Thomas and Isabel Bromley left one daughter, Margaret. As there was no male heir the greater part of Bromley's property ultimately passed to Margaret. Descendants Margaret Bromley married Sir Richard Newport, an important local landowner whose seat at High Ercall Hall lay just to the north-east of Wroxeter, in sight of the Wrekin. Margaret and Richard Newport had four sons, of whom two died in infancy, and three or four daughters. :*Sir Francis Newport, the eldest son and heir, married Beatrix Lacon. Their son and heir was ::*Richard Newport, 1st Baron Newport, whose title was a reward from Charles I for his financial support at the beginning of the English Civil War. His heir was: :::*Francis Newport, 1st Earl of Bradford, an important regional enforcer for Charles II and a Whig politician. Through him Bromley became ancestor of subsequent Earls of Bradford, although the title later passed through the female line to the Bridgeman family. :*Andrew Newport, the fourth son, was MP for Shrewsbury :*Mary Newport, married William Gratewood, nephew of Rowland Hill. However, the entry for the Newports in the Visitation of Shropshire features Mary twice, initially as a sister of Sir Richard, and only afterwards as a daughter. Moreover, there has been understandable confusion between Mary and Magdalen, her sister or niece. Placing her as a sister of Sir Richard seems more plausible chronologically, but the issue is uncertain. She is omitted from the family tree below. :*Isabel Newport married Sir Charles Foxe, whose father of the same name was an Inner Templar, MP for Ludlow and Much Wenlock and secretary to the Council in the Marches. The elder Sir Charles tried to provide for the sons of his second marriage and illegitimate son in his will and the younger contested the will unsuccessfully.Hasler: FOXE, Charles (d.1590), of Bromfield, Salop ‚Äì Author: Patricia Hyde :*Elizabeth Newport married first Francis Lawley and later his cousin, Thomas Lawley. The former marriage produced the line of Lawley baronets. :*Magdalen Newport, married Richard Herbert (d.1597), and was a friend of the poet John Donne, as well as mother of the poet George Herbert. =Family tree: descendants= The main lines of descent from Thomas Bromley and Isabel Lyster through their daughter Margaret are shown on the following family tree.

He became a Soviet activist after the annexation of Western Ukraine in 1939. He was arrested during the Stalinist Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee affair in 1949 and died in the prison, reportedly of heart attack. Biography Parnas was born in 1884 in Tarnopol, at that time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in the province of Galicia (now split between Poland and Ukraine), to Jewish parents. He graduated from the Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg in 1904. From 1920 to 1941, he was head of the Institute of the Medical Chemistry at Lviv University. He traveled across Europe, collaborating with universities in Cambridge, Naples, Strasbourg, Ghent and Zurich. He was a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, Corresponding Member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, as well an honorary doctor of Sorbonne University and the University of Athens. After the Soviet invasion of Poland and annexation of Western Ukraine in 1939 by the Soviet Union, Parnas remained in Lviv to continue his work in the institute. He also started collaborating with the Soviet authorities by taking on a political role in the communist District Soviet Worker's Delegation. In 1941, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Parnas was evacuated deeper into the USSR and remained there for the rest of his life. Only a few days after his departure Lviv was occupied by the Nazi Germany army, who massacred approximately 45 Lw√≥w professors. In the Soviet Union, Parnas met Joseph Stalin, and received his own laboratory. He became an Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and a founding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR. Despite his achievements and popularity, Parnas was falsely accused of being a spy of the West and arrested by the KGB on January 28, 1949. According to KGB's archives, he died during his first interrogation at Lubyanka prison \\"from a heart attack\\" on January 29, 1949.

He has also been cited for his contributions to the theory of large transients in computer systems and packet networks, and his universal law of computational scalability.Microsoft developer blog comparing Amdahl's law with Gunther's law (2009)Computer Measurement Group Interview part 1 and part 2 (2009)Springer author biographyOracle performance expertsLa Trobe University alumnus profile Interview with John C. Dvorak (1998) Gunther is a Senior Member of both the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), as well as a member of the American Mathematical Society (AMS), American Physical Society (APS), Computer Measurement Group (CMG) and ACM SIGMETRICS. He is currently focused on developing quantum information system technologies. Biography Gunther is an Australian of German and Scots ancestry, born in Melbourne on 15 August 1950. He attended Preston East Primary School from 1955 to 1956, and Balwyn North Primary School from 1956 until 1962. For his tenth birthday, Gunther received a copy of the now famous book entitled The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments from an older cousin. Inspired by the book, he started working on various experiments, making use of various chemicals that could be found around in his house. After he spilled some potassium permanganate solution on his bedroom carpet his mother confined him to an alcove in the garage which he turned into a small laboratory, replete with industrial chemicals and second-hand laboratory glassware. Gunther was interested in finding out how things like detergents and oils were composed by cracking them in his fractionating column. He took particular interest in mixing paints for his art classes, as well as his chemistry classes in Balwyn High School. His father, being the Superintendent of Melbourne's electrical power station, borrowed an organic chemistry text from the chemists in the quality control laboratory. This ultimately led to an intense interest in synthesizing Azo dyes. At around age 14, Gunther attempted to predict the color of azo dyes based on the chromophore-auxochrome combination. Apart from drawing up empirical tables, this effort was largely unsuccessful due to his lack of knowledge of quantum theory. =Post-Doc years= Gunther taught physics at San Jose State University from 1980‚Äì1981. He then joined Syncal Corporation, a small company contracted by NASA and JPL to develop thermoelectric materials for their deep-space missions. Gunther was asked to analyze the thermal stability test data from the Voyager RTGs. He discovered that the stability of the silicon-germanium (Si-Ge) thermoelectric alloy was controlled by a soliton-based precipitation mechanism. JPL used his work to select the next generation of RTG materials for the Galileo mission launched in 1989. =Xerox years= In 1982, Gunther joined Xerox PARC to develop parametric and functional test software for PARC's small-scale VLSI design fabrication line. Ultimately, he was recruited onto the Dragon multiprocessor workstation project where he also developed the PARCbench multiprocessor benchmark. This was his first fore into computer performance analysis. 1989, he developed a Wick-rotated version of Richard Feynman's quantum path integral formalism for analyzing performance degradation in large-scale computer systems and packet networks. =Pyramid years= In 1990 Gunther joined Pyramid Technology (now part of Fujitsu Siemens Computers) where he held positions as Senior Scientist and Manager of the Performance Analysis Group that was responsible for attaining industry-high TPC benchmarks on their Unix multiprocessors. He also performed simulations for the design of the Reliant RM1000 parallel database server. =Consulting practice= Gunther founded Performance Dynamics Company as a sole proprietorship, registered in California in 1994, to provide consulting and educational services for the management of high performance computer systems with an emphasis on performance analysis and enterprise-wide capacity planning. He went on to release and develop his own open-source performance modeling software called \\"PDQ (Pretty Damn Quick)\\" around 1998. That software also accompanied his first textbook on performance analysis entitled The Practical Performance Analyst. Several other books have followed since then. Current research interests =Quantum information systems= In 2004, Gunther has embarked on joint research into quantum information systems based on photonics. During the course of his research in this area, he has developed a theory of photon bifurcation that is currently being tested experimentally at √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne. This represents yet another application of path integral formulation to circumvent the wave-particle duality of light. In its simplest rendition, this theory can be considered as providing the quantum corrections to the Abbe-Rayleigh diffraction theory of imaging and the Fourier theory of optical information processing. =Performance visualization= Inspired by the work of Tukey, Gunther explored ways to help systems analyst visualize performance in a manner similar to that already available in scientific visualization and information visualization. In 1991, he developed a tool called Barry, which employs barycentric coordinates to visualize sampled CPU usage data on large-scale multiprocessor systems. More recently, he has applied the same 2-simplex barycentric coordinates to visualizing the Apdex application performance metric, which is based on categorical response time data. A barycentric 3-simplex (a tetrahedron), that can be swivelled on the computer screen using a mouse, has been found useful for visualizing packet network performance data. In 2008, he co-founded the PerfViz google group. =Universal Law of Computational Scalability= The throughput capacity X(N) of a computational platform is given by: :X(N) = frac{gamma N}{1 + alpha (N-1) + beta N (N-1)} where N represents either the number of physical processors in the hardware configuration or the number of users driving the software application. The parameters alpha, beta and gamma respectively represent the levels of contention (e.g., queueing for shared resources), coherency delay (i.e., latency for data to become consistent) and concurrency (or effective parallelism) in the system. The beta parameter also quantifies the retrograde throughput seen in many stress tests but not accounted for in either Amdahl's law or event-based simulations. This scalability law was originally developed by Gunther in 1993 while he was employed at Pyramid Technology. Since there are no topological dependencies, C(N) can model symmetric multiprocessors, multicores, clusters, and GRID architectures. Also, because each of the three terms has a definite physical meaning, they can be employed as a heuristic to determine where to make performance improvements in hardware platforms or software applications. At a more fundamental level, the above equation can be derived from the Machine Repairman queueing model: > Theorem (Gunther 2008): The universal scalability law is equivalent to the > synchronous queueing bound on throughput in a modified Machine Repairman > with state-dependent service times. The following corollary (Gunther 2008 with beta = 0) corresponds to Amdahl's law: > Theorem (Gunther 2002): Amdahl's law for parallel speedup is equivalent to > the synchronous queueing bound on throughput in a Machine Repairman model of > a multiprocessor.

The resulting knowledge model can only be computer interpretable when it is expressed in some knowledge representation language or data structure that enables the knowledge to be interpreted by software and to be stored in a database or data exchange file. Knowledge-based engineering or knowledge-aided design is a process of computer-aided usage of such knowledge models for the design of products, facilities or processes. The design of products or facilities then uses the knowledge model to guide the creation of the facility or product that need to be designed. In other words, it used knowledge about a kind of object to create a product model of an (imaginary) individual object. Similarly, the design of a particular process implies the creation of a process model, which design activity can be guided by the knowledge that is contained in a knowledge model about such a kind of process. The resulting process model, product model or facility model is typically also stored in a database. Usually the knowledge representation language only allows to represent knowledge (about kinds of things), whereas another language or data structure is required to represent and store the information models about individual things. If the knowledge representation language enables to express both, then the knowledge model and the information model can be expressed in the same language (or data structure). An example of a language that enables the expression of knowledge as well as information about individual things is Gellish English. The basis of a knowledge model of an assembly physical object is a decomposition structure that specifies the components of the assembly and possible the sub-components of the components. For example, knowledge about a compressor system includes that a compressor system consists of a compressor, a lubrication system, etc., whereas a lubrication system consists of a pump system, etc. Assume that this knowledge is expressed in a knowledge representation language that expresses knowledge as a collection of relations between two kinds of things, whereas in that language a relation type is defined that is called . Then a part of a knowledge model about a compressor system will consist of the following expressions of knowledge facts: * compressor system shall have as part a compressor * compressor system shall have as part a lubrication system * lubrication system shall have as part a pump system * pump system shall have as part a pump Such a knowledge model will be further extended with knowledge and specifications about the properties of the components, their fabrications and possibly testing and maintenance requirements. Similarly, a knowledge model of a process is basically a specification of the sequence of process stages. This sequence is determined by the fact that a kind of stream is output of a kind of process stage, whereas that same type of stream in input in the next process stage. So the defined streams have roles as inputs to process stages, whereas the same streams are outputs of other process stages. For example: * water shall be input in a boiler * steam shall be output of a boiler * steam shall be input in a heater * condensate shall be output of a heater * etc. Explicitation of document content Knowledge modeling includes the explicitation of knowledge and requirements that is available in documents, such as design manuals, (international) standard specifications and standard data sheets. In order to make such knowledge computer interpretable it needs to be expressed in a formal knowledge representation language and thus transformed into a computer interpretable form. For example, in the form of an expressions Gellish English. This enables that the knowledge and requirements are related to the objects in the knowledge model, whereas the whole model is again stored in a Database. The knowledge that is contained in documents can be modeled at various levels of explicitation. A low level of explicitation keeps large parts of the specifications in the form of natural language text. This means that the text is only human interpretable, but is nevertheless related to the objects in the knowledge model. Thus software can still present the information to users when knowledge about that object is requested. The other extreme is that the content of each sentence in a documents is converted in the formal knowledge representation language and thus the objects that are mentioned in those sentences become an integral part of the computer interpretable knowledge model. For example, the knowledge that the API 617 standard contains a standard specification for compressors can be linked to the concept compressor in the knowledge model of a compressor system. This can be expressed in a knowledge representation language (using the relation type as follows: * compressor API 617 A higher level of explicitation means that paragraphs or sentences in natural language are related to components in the knowledge model. A full explicit model means that the natural language sentences are completely transformed into data in a database structure. For example, a specification of a minimum shaft diameter might be included in the knowledge model as follows: * shaft diameter 20 mm The above described explicitation process results in Knowledge Models and Standard Specifications Models that enable their use for computer supported knowledge-aided design as well as for automated verification of designs.

The full name of the unit is 30th Independent Mechanized Brigade \\"Konstanty Ostrogski\\".Ukrainian President decree ‚Ññ646/2015  History  = World War II = Between September 1 and October 1, 1941, the 83rd Cavalry Division was formed in the city of Samarkand, Uzbekistan. The division consisted of the following units: * 215th Cavalry Regiment * 226th Cavalry Regiment * 231st Cavalry Regiment * Separate Chemical Squadron From September 5, 1941, the commanding officer of the division was Lieutenant General Selivanov. On November 7, 1941, the division was sent to the Volga Military District where it was assigned to the newly forming Cavalry mechanized group of the 61st Army. Until December 28, 1941, the division was fortifying near the station of Lysi Gory Saratov Oblast. The first battle that the division took part in was near the city of Ryazhsk, Ryazan Oblast as part of the Cavalry mechanized group of the 61st Army as part of the Bryansk Front and the Soviet winter counter offensive in front of Moscow. In January 1942 the division was assigned to the 7th Cavalry Corps and was assigned to be a Mobile Group in the Moscow Defense Zone for the 61st Army. The division remained with the 7th Cavalry Corps for the rest of 1942 and when the Corps was redesignated as the 6th Guards Cavalry Corps in January 1943 the division became the 13th Guards Cavalry Division on 19 January 1943.Red Sabers, Soviet Cavalry Corps, Divisions, and Brigades, 1941-1945, Charles C. Sharp The division was under the command of General Major Pyotr Zubov. The 13th Guards Cavalry Division fought at Dubno in 1944, as well as at the Battle of Debrecen and was with 6th Guards Cavalry Corps of the 2nd Ukrainian Front in May 1945. = Cold War = Feskov et al. trace the unit's history as follows. At the beginning of June, the division relocated to Novohrad-Volynskyi. On 1 August 1945, the division was converted into the 11th Guards Mechanized Division. During November and December 1956, the division fought in the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. 44 soldiers of the division were killed during the campaign in Hungary. The division moved back to Novohrad-Volynskyi in January 1957. On 4 June 1957 it became the 30th Guards Tank Division, part of the 8th Tank Army. In 1960, the division's 58th Separate Tank Training Battalion was disbanded. On 19 February 1962 the 335th Separate Missile Battalion and the 108th Separate Equipment Maintenance and Recovery Battalion were activated. In 1968 the 151st Separate Guards Sapper Battalion became the 151st Separate Guards Engineer-Sapper Battalion. The 1043rd Separate Material Supply Battalion was created from the motor transport battalion in 1980. During the Cold War, the division was maintained at 25% strength. In November 1990, the division was equipped with 224 T-72 main battle tanks. = 1990‚Äìpresent = The 30th Guards Tank Division, along with the rest of the 8th Tank Army and the Carpathian Military District, became part of the Ukrainian Ground Forces according to the order of Ukraine About Armed Forces of Ukraine from December 6, 1991. In February 1992, all units of the division pledged their allegiance to Ukraine. It was still designated a tank division as of Decree N 350/93 (August 21, 1993). On October 20, 1999, the division was awarded the Novohrad-Volynskyi designation. On July 30, 2004, the division was reformed into a brigade. Currently the brigade is the only mechanized brigade that does not have any conscripts. It is also a part of Joint Rapid Reaction Forces. Over a hundred soldiers from the brigade have served in peacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone, Lebanon, Iraq and Kosovo. A battalion of the brigade was part of POLUKRBAT in the 2006 rotation. As of October 12, 2007, the 2nd Mechanized Battalion of the brigade is deployed in Kosovo as part of the POLUKRBAT. The current commander of the brigade served as a commander of the 5th Separate Mechanized brigade in Iraq.

(echoing, perhaps, Calder√≥n's classic Golden-Age comedy Life is a Dream), but he completed only the first act.

The play tackles \\"issues of class and ideological division, of intolerance and hatred, all of them acted out in a theatre where the actors are as much the audience as the audience the actors.\\"Edwards (1994, xxxv). Lorca's experiments in this direction echo the work of Pirandello (whose Six Characters in Search of an Author (1921) attempted to stage a similar transgression), though Lorca develops the effect in a far more politically orientated, almost Brechtian direction.

It caused severe hardships in economic terms and living conditions in a country still recovering from the Second World War. There were massive disruptions of energy supply for homes, offices and factories. Animal herds froze or starved to death. People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When warm weather returned, the ice thawed and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas. Beginning on 23 January 1947, the UK experienced several cold spells that brought large drifts of snow to the country, blocking roads and railways, which caused problems transporting coal to the electric power stations. Many had to shut down, forcing severe restrictions to cut power consumption, including restricting domestic electricity to nineteen hours per day and cutting some industrial supplies completely. In addition, radio broadcasts were limited, television services were suspended, some magazines were ordered to stop publishing, and newspapers were reduced in size. These measures, on top of the low temperatures, badly affected public morale and the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, became a scapegoat; he received death threats and had to be placed under police guard. Towards the end of February, there were also fears of a food shortage as supplies were cut off and vegetables were frozen into the ground. Mid-March brought warmer air to the country which thawed the snow lying on the ground. This snowmelt rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10% of the year's industrial production, 10 to 20% of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The governing Labour Party began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party at the 1950 general election; on top of other factors. That winter is also cited as a factor in the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80 and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to rebuild war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.  Fuel shortage  Emanuel Shinwell The effects of the cold winter were exacerbated by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed under the control of the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war.. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).. These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity ‚Äì the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.  Timeline  = January = The winter began with two periods of cold weather in December 1946 and January 1947, but the coldest period did not begin until 21 January 1947. The main cause of the cold weather was an anti-cyclone which sat over Scandinavia from 20 January. This high-pressure area blocked the progression of depressions across the Atlantic Ocean and forced them to the south of the United Kingdom, resulting in strong easterly winds which brought snow to eastern and south-eastern England before progressing across the entire country. This cold spell continued and by 30 January the Isles of Scilly were under of snow and the overnight temperature at Writtle, Essex, was . Throughout January the highest recorded temperature in England and Wales was and the minimum was . = February = Low pressure over the UK on 3 February The easterly winds continued into February, which developed into one of the coldest months on record. At Kew Observatory there was no recorded temperature above for the month and only twice was the overnight temperature above . No sunshine at all was recorded at Kew for twenty days from 2 February, whilst across England and Wales the month was the second-dullest February since records began in 1929, with only 30.8 hours of sunshine or 1.1 per day.Met Office; Monthly ranked England and Wales sunshine In contrast, West Scotland was near-record dry and unusually sunny,Met Office; Symon's British rainfall, 1947, p. 48 though still extremely cold. On 20 February the ferry service across the English Channel between Dover and Ostend was suspended due to pack ice off the Belgian coast. In some places snow fell on 26 days out of 28 in the month and a temperature of was recorded at Woburn, Bedfordshire, on 25 February. As a result, railways were badly affected by drifts of light powdery snow and three hundred main roads were made unusable.. Several hundred villages were cut off. Ice floes were also seen off the coast of East Anglia, causing a hazard to shipping. This cold weather exacerbated the fuel problem. Stockpiles of coal at the pits and depots froze solid and could not be moved. The snow also trapped 750,000 railway wagons of coal and made roads unusable, further hampering transport. A force of 100,000 British and Polish troops and German prisoners of war were put to work clearing snow from the railways by hand, while desperate attempts were made to get fuel to power stations by coal-carrying ships which risked storms, fog and ice to reach their destinations. Despite such expedients, lack of fuel forced many power stations to shut down or reduce their output. The Royal Navy launched Operation Blackcurrant, which used diesel generators aboard submarines to provide supplementary power to coastal towns and dockyards. Shinwell acted to reduce consumption of coal by cutting the electricity supply to industry completely and reducing the domestic supply to 19 hours per day across the country. In consequence factories across the country were forced to shut and up to four million people claimed unemployment benefits. Although so many people were made redundant there was little unrest and no major public disorders. Television services were suspended completely, radio broadcasts were reduced, some magazines were ordered to stop being published, and newspapers were cut in size to four pages or one sheet. Food rations, still in use from the Second World War, were cut to levels lower than in the war years. These measures made little difference to the rate of coal consumption but served to reduce public morale. Despite Shinwell's actions the fuel supply remained insufficient and blackouts occurred across large swathes of the country, forcing even the staff at Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and London's Central Electricity Board to work by candlelight. A trade meeting with representatives from Russia and Iceland was also held without light or heating; one of the items discussed was the purchase of coal from Britain. The public was reduced to queuing at gasworks to collect coke for use as fuel. Supplies of aspirin also ran low as it was then a product of coal-tar, thousands of chickens in poultry farms died of the cold, and public transport services were cut to save fuel. Shinwell became increasingly unpopular with the general public and received a bomb threat, after which a four-man police guard was stationed at his house in Tooting. Despite this, he remained very popular with the miners, which made the government wary of dismissing him in case it caused industrial action. By 27 February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes at the power stations, easing the fuel crisis. During this period there was a fear that, despite the rationing, food supplies could run out owing to the effects of the cold on vegetables, livestock and delivery vehicles. In response, the government started a largely unsuccessful campaign to popularise Snoek, an inexpensive South African variety of fish; the public found the fish unpalatable and its stocks were eventually used as cat food. Many winter root vegetables could not be harvested as they were frozen into the ground, and in some areas pneumatic drills were used to excavate them. Frost destroyed of potatoes and, as a result, potatoes were rationed for the first time. = March = Milder air moving over the UK on 10 March On 4‚Äì5 March came heavy snow which left drifts across much of the country with some lying deep in the Scottish Highlands. On 5 March one of the worst British blizzards of the 20th century occurred. Food supplies were again affected by the snow-bound roads and in some places the police requested permission to break into delivery lorries stranded by the snow. On 10 March milder air of began to move north across the country from the south-west, rapidly thawing the snow lying on low ground. However, after such a long frost the ground stayed frozen. The frozen ground caused much surface run off which resulted in widespread flooding. Further heavy snowfalls occurred as the milder air pushed northwards. On 14 March the deepest ever recorded depth of snow lying in an inhabited location of the UK was measured at Forest-in-Teesdale in County Durham at . On 15 March a deepening depression moved in from the Atlantic, bringing heavy rain and gales. It was the start of the wettest March for 300 years. By 16 March winds reached with gusts, causing breaches in dykes in East Anglia that resulted in the flooding of of land, and blowing many trees down. The rivers Thames and Lea flooded in London, causing the Windsor borough engineer Geoffrey Baker to remark: \\"We could only cope if we had a spare Thames, or two.\\" A bulldozer towing a sledge delivers bread to the snowbound village of Llanwddyn, Montgomeryshire, on 15 March 1947. Flooding from the River Trent in West Bridgford near Nottingham On 17‚Äì18 March the River Trent overtopped its banks in Nottingham. Large parts of the city and surrounding areas were flooded, in which 9,000 properties and nearly a hundred industrial premises were affected ‚Äì some to first-floor height. The suburbs of Long Eaton, West Bridgford and Beeston suffered particularly badly. Two days later, in the lower tidal reaches of the river, the peak of the flood combined with a high spring tide to flood villages and 2,000 properties in Gainsborough. River levels dropped when the floodbank at Morton breached, resulting in the flooding of some of farmland in the Trent valley. The flooding subsided in the west of the country by 20 March but rivers in the east were still rising and the Wharfe, Derwent, Aire and Ouse all burst their banks in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Selby was also badly affected with 70 per cent of houses being flooded. More than 100,000 properties were affected by the flooding and the Army worked to prevent the spread of the floodwater, particularly at pumping plants and power stations. Royal Engineers on national service handed out milk to families with babies and the Australian Red Cross assisted in Gloucester. The people of Canada sent food parcels to villages in Suffolk and the Premier of Ontario, George A. Drew, offered to help distribute them personally. The flooding lasted for about a week, with some waters taking an additional ten days to subside.  Legacy  The winter had a lasting effect on Britain's industry; by February 1947 it was already estimated that that year's industrial output would be down by 10 per cent. The effects of the March floods added a further ¬£250‚Äì375 million (equivalent to ¬£‚Äì billion in ) in damage. Farming was particularly badly hit with cereal and potato harvests down 10 to 20 per cent on the previous two years. Sheep farmers lost one quarter of their flocks and it would be six years before sheep numbers recovered. In Wales a disaster fund of ¬£4,575,000 was partly allocated to assist farmers who lost about 4 million sheep.Jones (2012) pp 46, 48. The winter had political ramifications and caused the public to lose faith in a Labour government who could not maintain food and electricity supplies. Shinwell never publicly admitted that the crisis had resulted from low coal supplies, instead blaming the climate, the railway system, or capitalism generally. But the public blamed the long-time Labour activist, and Shinwell was forced to resign in October.Kenneth O. Morgan, The people's peace: British history, 1945‚Äì1990 (1992) pp 68‚Äì69. Shinwell's resignation did not absolve the party: Labour lost a large number of seats to the Conservative Party in the following election (but retained a slim majority). Youngs et al. conclude that, \\"Probably more than anything else, the fuel crisis of 1947 led to a loss of public confidence in the Labour government.\\"Frederic A. Youngs Jr, et al. The English Heritage ‚Äì Vol. 2 (1999) 2:425. The effects of the winter came at a time of heavy government spending with 15 per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new National Health Service and post-war reconstruction. This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and push through the Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more snow was recorded.  Outside the United Kingdom  Women in Germany collecting fuel in 1946 The winter affected many other European countries. Similar cold periods and snowfalls were seen in much of Central Europe and the southern Baltic region. De Bilt, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands, experienced its worst winter since 1790. Because of the anticyclone to the north of the United Kingdom, several incoming Atlantic depressions which would otherwise have hit Britain tracked south to the Mediterranean region, resulting in Portugal, Spain, and Southern France having more rain than usual while remaining relatively warm. For example, the February rainfall at Gibraltar was , three times the average. As a result, France experienced both the extreme cold in the north and much rain in the south. The winter caused 150 deaths from the cold and lack of food in Berlin, which was still recovering from its devastation during the final stages of the Second World War. It caused schools in the Netherlands to be closed, led to a mob attack on a goods train carrying coal in Copenhagen, and caused the closure of businesses and the restriction of domestic gas supplies in Ireland.

It consisted of armed and unarmed actions of resistance groups against the Wehrmacht forces in Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Bulgaria authorities. It was mainly communist and pro-Soviet Union. Participants in the armed resistance were called partizanin (a partisan) and yatak (a helper, or a supporter, someone who provides cover for someone else). Background The Communists had long despised the pro-German policy of Prime Minister Bogdan Filov and even campaigned in 1940 for a political pact with Moscow (the Sobolev action). German forces entered Bulgaria on 1‚Äì2 March 1941 as a result of Bulgaria's adhesion to the Axis.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 15th edition. Macropaedia. Vol.29.

At the start of World War II, the Comintern supported a policy of non- intervention, arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes, but when the Soviet Union itself was invaded on 22 June 1941, the Comintern changed its position. The resistance movement was set up in August 1941 by the Bulgarian Communist Party to oppose the pro-Nazi government. Beginning The German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 sparked the rage of Communists and Russophiles in Bulgaria. The same day the BCP spread a brochure among the people urging them \\"to hinder by all means the usage of Bulgarian land and soldiers for the criminal purposes of German fascism\\". Two days later, on 24 June, the BCP called for an armed resistance against the Wehrmacht and the Bogdan Filov government. On 23 July 1941 an illegal radio station ‚Äî \\"Hristo Botev\\" (\\"–•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ –ë–æ—Ç–µ–≤\\") ‚Äî began broadcasting.–ì–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏ —Ä–∞–¥–∏–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—è ¬´–•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ –ë–æ—Ç–µ–≤¬ª (23 —é–ª–∏ 1941 ‚Äî 22 —Å–µ–ø—Ç–µ–º–≤—Ä–∏ 1944). —Ç. 1 ‚Äî 7. –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1950‚Äî1952 In the first year of the resistance the BCP used mainly its combat groups. They carried out a number of actions, including arson and demolition of arms, clothes and fuel warehouses, communications, factories and transport lines. The combat groups assassinated prominent Bulgarian politicians, army and police leaders, and Wehrmacht officers. The combat groups' activities impaired the image of Hitler's supporters in Bulgaria but a great number of their members were captured or killed. The first known partisan in Bulgaria was Ivan Kozarev. The first guerrilla group (cheta) was created on 26 June 1941 near Razlog, the first partisan commander was Nikola Parapunov. The second group was created in August 1941. Other guerrilla detachments were created in the late summer and autumn of 1941.–ò. –ö–∏–Ω–æ–≤, –ò. –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤, –®—Ç. –ê—Ç–∞–Ω–∞—Å–æ–≤ –∏ –¥—Ä. –í–∫–ª–∞–¥ –±–æ–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞ –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–≥—Ä–æ–º —Ñ–∞—à–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π –ì–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω–∏–∏. –ú., –í–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 1967. —Å—Ç—Ä.27 The first guerrilla detachments were relatively small.

In September 1941, Bulgarian communist emigr√©s arrived on Soviet submarines and aircraft to boost the resistance movement. 55 experienced communist fighters were sent by the Foreign Bureau of the BCP, according to one version. According to another version, they were sent by order of the NKVD, of which the Bulgarian Communists in Moscow were not aware. The landing of the so-called \\"paratroopers\\" and \\"submariners\\" turned out to be precipitate and most of them were captured or killed.

This destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the German army, and showed that the blitzkrieg in the Soviet Union had failed. In April 1942, a map titled \\"The Danube area\\" was published in Germany, where the so-called \\"new annexed territories\\" of Bulgaria in Macedonia and Thrace were described as \\"territories under temporary Bulgarian administration\\". This was a failure for Sofia's official propaganda, which claimed to have completed the national unification of the Bulgarians. These events led to a rise in the partisans' manpower and prestige. In July 1942, Georgi Dimitrov announced the creation of the Fatherland Front (FF), on the underground radio station \\"Hristo Botev\\". It was a major anti-fascist coalition between the Communists, the Agrarians and the \\"Zveno\\" party. The FF demanded the non-participation of Bulgarian forces in the war against the USSR, the immediate return of Bulgarian occupation forces from Greek and Yugoslav territory, the repudiation of the union with Germany, a halt of the export of grain to Nazi Germany, friendly relations with the USSR, the United Kingdom and the United States, the restoration of civil freedoms, denunciation of non-constitutional laws, cessation of military actions against civil population, dismissal of all pro-fascist organizations and eradication of racial hatred. Despite the arrest and later execution of most of the Central Committee of the BCP (through betrayal by one of its members), the strength of the partisans continued to grow. In August 1943 the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party joined the FF. Fierce fighting Due to the growing number and manpower of combat groups and partisan detachments, in April 1943 they were organized into the People's Liberation Rebel Army (Narodoosvoboditelna vastanicheska armija, NOVA). NOVA divided Bulgaria into 12 Rebel Operative Zones which implied BWP's intention of seizing power. The Bulgarian authorities responded by intensifying the persecution of resistance members. Thousands of opposition activists were killed, imprisoned or interned. The government created a special gerndarmerie force which received almost unlimited power to pursue the partisans. The gendarmes became notorious for carrying out atrocities against captured partisans and their yatatsi. Gendarmerie and the police also became increasingly involved in harassment, arson and murders of partisans' families. Partisans staged attacks on railroads and warehouses, used by the German or the Bulgarian forces. When that was possible, they captured villages to organize meetings in support of the FF, destroy police and tax archives and supply themselves with food and arms. BCP increased its activity among Bulgarian soldiers. A frequent result was the army's low effectiveness in fighting partisan detachments. A significant number of soldiers deserted to join the partisans. Such events were mainly observed in the Bulgarian forces in Yugoslavia and Greece. Seven partisan detachments were created from former army battalions which sided with the partisans. The most prominent soldier- partisan commanders were Ditcho Petrov and Atanas Rusev. In the spring of 1944, the Bulgarian government decided to crush the partisans and mobilised about 100,000 soldiers, policemen and gendarmes, which were thrown into mass actions against the guerrillas. The result was the opposite of that desired. As the Red Army advanced towards the Balkans, even more people joined the resistance. NOVA grew as a significant military force. In the Tran, Rhodopes and Sredna Gora regions, the partisans were a constant threat to the government. Takeover of the government On 2 September 1944, the pro-German government of Ivan Bagryanov stepped down in response to the Red Army's advance towards Bulgaria. A pro-Western government of the former legal opposition came to power. It ordered the army not to resist Soviet forces, demanded that the Wehrmacht leave, repudiated the union with Germany and started negotiations with the NOVA commander Dobri Terpeshev. The right wing Agrarians, who controlled the government, offered the FF some ministerial positions. In the meantime, the police and the army continued to pursue the partisans, unchecked by civil authority. Advancing Soviet troops gave the Communists self-confidence and they rejected the Agrarians' offer. Between 6 and 9 September 1944, 170 Bulgarian towns and villages were captured by the partisans. On 9 September, Terpeshev ordered all partisans to descend from the mountains and seize power in all of Bulgaria - '\\"All brigades, battalions and cheti of the people's liberation army are to capture the villages and towns and install FF committees in them\\"'. In Sofia, \\"Zveno\\" mobilised its influence in the military and strong army detachments, including the Tank brigade, sided with the FF and staged a coup on the night of 8/9 September. Soon after FF's seizure of power, the partisans became the first forces to resist the attempted return of the Wehrmacht in Bulgaria on its western and northwestern border. Bulgarian partisans also participated in the liberation from Nazi occupation of some towns and villages in Yugoslavia and Greece. After 9 September and prior to Bulgaria's army joining the Allies' fight against the Axis, former partisans were placed in key positions in the Bulgarian military to ensure its loyalty. Former partisans also built up the new People's Militia, which replaced the Bulgarian police. They allegedly participated in mass retaliation which took the lives of thousands of former civil servants, policemen and gendarmes.  Strength of partisan forces  The ultimate number of partisans according to the official historiography of People's Republic of Bulgaria was around 30,000. However, researchers after the transition to democracy point to a figure of around 9,900. In addition, there were foreign members of Bulgarian resistance movement during World War II - 68 Soviet citizens and ex-soldiers (former prisoners of war, who escaped from Nazi concentration camps),–ê–Ω—Ç–∏—Ñ–∞—à–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è —Å–æ–ª–∏–¥–∞—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤ –≥–æ–¥—ã –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã, 1939-1945 / —Ä–µ–¥–∫–æ–ª–ª., –ê.–ù. –®–ª–µ–ø–∞–∫–æ–≤, –í.–ê. –í—Ä–æ–¥–∏–π –∏ –¥—Ä. –ö–∏–µ–≤, \\"–ù–∞—É–∫–æ–≤–∞ –¥—É–º–∫–∞\\", 1987. —Å—Ç—Ä.157 several Russian white √©migr√©s (former participants in the White movement),–†.–¢. –ê–±–ª–æ–≤–∞. –°–æ—Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏ –±–æ–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –≤ –±–æ—Ä—å–±–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ —Ñ–∞—à–∏–∑–º–∞ (1941-1945 –≥–≥.). –ú., 1973. —Å—Ç—Ä.294 several Serbs and 1 Czech communist.–ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ—Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ö–ü–°–° –∏ –ë–ö–ü: –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∏ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. / —Ä–µ–¥. –ê.–ì. –ï–≥–æ—Ä–æ–≤, –î. –ï–ª–∞–∑–∞—Ä. –ú., –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 1985. —Å—Ç—Ä.88 At the beginning of September 1944, the NOVA partisan units comprised one partisan division, 9 partisan brigades, 37 partisan detachments and several combat groups (cheti).–ë–æ–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è // –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è (–≤ 8 —Ç—Ç.) / –ø–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–¥. –ù. –í. –û–≥–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∞. —Ç–æ–º 1. –ú.: –í–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 1976. —Å—Ç—Ä.549 In the clashes with government and German forces and as a result of torture and executions 2 740 people died between 1941 and 1944.Debating the Past: Modern Bulgarian History: from Stambolov to Zhivkov, Rumen Daskalov, Central European University Press, 2011, , p. 193.

Heilmeier's work is an IEEE Milestone. Biography Heilmeier was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School there, received his BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and his M.S.E., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees in solid state materials and electronics from Princeton University. In 1958 Heilmeier joined RCA Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked on parametric amplification, tunnel diode down-converters, millimeter wave generation, ferroelectric thin film devices, organic semiconductors and electro-optic effects in molecular and liquid crystals. In 1964 he discovered several new electro-optic effects in liquid crystals, which led to the first working liquid crystal displays based on what he called the dynamic scattering mode (DSM). Heilmeier spent much of the 1970s in the United States Department of Defense. From 1970-71 he served as a White House Fellow and special assistant to the Secretary of Defense, performing long-range research and development planning. In 1971 he was appointed Assistant Director for Defense Research and Engineering, Electronic and Physical Sciences, overseeing all research and exploratory development in electronics and the physical sciences. In 1975 he was named Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and initiated major efforts in stealth aircraft, space-based lasers, space- based infrared technology, and artificial intelligence. In December 1977 Heilmeier left government to become vice president at Texas Instruments; in 1983 he was promoted to Chief Technical Officer. From 1991-1996 he was president and CEO of Bellcore (now Telcordia), ultimately overseeing its sale to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). He served as the company's chairman and CEO from 1996-1997, and afterwards as its chairman emeritus. Heilmeier had received numerous awards, held 15 patents, and was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the Defense Science Board, and the National Security Agency Advisory Board. He served on the board of trustees of Fidelity Investments and of Teletech Holdings, and the Board of Overseers of the School of Engineering and Applied Science of the University of Pennsylvania.

The modern village was founded in 1923 near the confluence of the Arkhyz and Pshish rivers. It is located in a mountainous region in the vicinity of the eponymous aul sitting at an altitude of 1,450 meters. The elevation of the surrounding mountains is more than 3,000 meters above the sea. The population is  Zelenchuksky Churches  The Zelenchuksky Churches are an archaeological preserve extending for around the ruins of Nizhnearkhyzskoe gorodishche, tentatively identified as the medieval capital of Alania, a Christian state destroyed by the hordes of M√∂ngke Khan in the 13th century. No Byzantine document mentions the name of this city, whereas al-Mas'udi refers to it as Ma'as, or Maghas. The most remarkable feature of the site is a cluster of three early medieval churches, whose construction is associated with the missionary activities of Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos in the Northern Caucasus. These structures bear much resemblance to the Shoana Church and Senty Church, situated in the neighbouring valleys. In the 19th century the churches were affiliated with the monastery of St. Alexander Nevsky. A monastic community was revived there after the fall of the Soviet Union. The North Church is supposed to have been the cathedral of the diocese of Alania between the 10th and 13th centuries. The dome rises to a height of 21 meters; the western wall is twice as long. The narthex formerly contained a baptistery. A 19th-century traveller described the faded Byzantine frescoes that were still visible on its walls. The Central Church appears to have been conceived somewhat earlier than the two others, in the form of a regular cross, but was extended to the west during or shortly following the construction. It is much larger than the South Church, which was built of coarse rubble masonry, extensively restored by the monks in 1899, fell into disuse during the Soviet years, and was reconsecrated to St. Elijah in 1991. The South Church bears the distinction of being the oldest functioning church in all of Russia.Information about the church, from the Arkhyz Observatory website. Within 30 km from Nizhny Arkhyz a short grave inscription was discovered in 1888. Although it is written in Greek characters, the inscription (alternatively dated to 941 or 963) was interpreted by Vasily Abayev as the earliest preserved text in the Ossetic language. Another tourist attraction in the valley is a mandylion-type rock painting of Christ, datable to the 10th century but discovered only recently.  Observatory  Arkhyz is also the site of a Soviet astrophysical observatory which formerly boasted the world's largest solid-mirror reflecting telescope (6 meters in diameter).The Encyclopedia Americana.

Mugar (March 5, 1901 ‚Äì October 16, 1982) was the founder of the Star Market chain of supermarkets in New England. He was also a philanthropist and the most prominent member of the Mugar family of Greater Boston. Early life Mugar was born March 5, 1901, in Kharpert (Harput) in the Mamuret-ul- Aziz Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey), of Armenian parents. His father, Sarkis, and mother, Vosgitel, and his two sisters, Alice and Mary, whose family name was shortened from Mugardichian, were Armenians who came to the United States from the Ottoman Empire in 1906 to join his father's brothers who owned a restaurant on Massachusetts Avenue in Boston. Another sister, Helen, was born after their arrival in Massachusetts. The 1910 United States Census shows the family in the 19th Ward of Boston and lists Sarkis Mugar's occupation as \\"waiter in restaurant.\\" In 1916, Sarkis Mugar paid $800.00 for the Star Market, a small grocery store, at 28 Mt. Auburn Street in Watertown and Stephen eventually went to work for his father in the store. Early career In 1922, Stephen's father was killed at age 49 from complications from an automobile accident, leaving Stephen to take over the Star Market to support his mother, himself and his sisters. The second Star Market was opened in Newtonville in 1932 and the third one was opened in Wellesley in 1937.http://www.ci.watertown.ma.us/DocumentView.asp?DID=643 Later career After the war ended and wartime restrictions and shortages were over, Stephen worked with his younger cousin John M. Mugar to expand Star Market throughout Greater Boston to meet the increased affluence and consumer demand. The second Star Market in Newtonville opened in 1948 and was the Mugar's first supermarket. It was the prototype of the other modern supermarkets that Stephen and John opened during this period. Meats and produce were packaged in cellophane wrappers to make them more appealing to consumers. A conveyor belt carried bags of groceries to a central pickup station by the parking lot. Customers tired of no self-service at stores such as A&P; or self-service but little else at First National Stores Finast came from miles around to patronize the new Star Market.

It was introduced by Christopher Longuet-Higgins in 1981 for the case of the essential matrix. In theory, this algorithm can be used also for the fundamental matrix, but in practice the normalized eight-point algorithm, described by Richard Hartley in 1997, is better suited for this case. The algorithm's name derives from the fact that it estimates the essential matrix or the fundamental matrix from a set of eight (or more) corresponding image points. However, variations of the algorithm can be used for fewer than eight points.  Coplanarity constraint  Example of epipolar geometry. Two cameras, with their respective centers of projection points OL and OR, observe a point P. The projection of P onto each of the image planes is denoted pL and pR. Points EL and ER are the epipoles. One may express the epipolar geometry of two cameras and a point in space with an algebraic equation. Observe that, no matter where the point P is in space, the vectors overline{O_L P}, overline{O_R P} and overline{O_R O_L} belong to the same plane. Call X_L the coordinates of point P in the left eye's reference frame and call X_R the coordinates of P in the right eye's reference frame and call R, T the rotation and translation between the two reference frames s.t. X_R = R (X_L-T) is the relationship between the coordinates of P in the two reference frames. The following equation always holds because the vector generated from T wedge X_L is orthogonal to both T and X_L : : X_L^T T wedge X_L - T^T T wedge X_L = (X_L-T)^T T wedge X_L = 0 Because I = R^T R , we get : (X_L-T)^T R^T R T wedge X_L = 0 . Replacing (X_L-T)^TR^T with X_R^T, we get : X_R^T R T wedge X_L = X_R^T R S X_L = X_R^T E X_L = 0 Observe that T wedge may be thought of as a matrix; Longuet-Higgins used the symbol S to denote it. The product R T wedge = R S is often called essential matrix and denoted with E . The vectors overline{O_L p_L}, overline{O_R p_R} are parallel to the vectors overline{O_L P}, overline{O_R P} and therefore the coplanarity constraint holds if we substitute these vectors. If we call y, y' the coordinates of the projections of P onto the left and right image planes, then the coplanarity constraint may be written as : y'^T mathbf{E} y = 0  The basic algorithm  The basic eight-point algorithm is here described for the case of estimating the essential matrix mathbf{E} . It consists of three steps. First, it formulates a homogeneous linear equation, where the solution is directly related to mathbf{E} , and then solves the equation, taking into account that it may not have an exact solution. Finally, the internal constraints of the resulting matrix are managed. The first step is described in Longuet- Higgins' paper, the second and third steps are standard approaches in estimation theory. The constraint defined by the essential matrix mathbf{E} is : (mathbf{y}')^{T} , mathbf{E} , mathbf{y} = 0 for corresponding image points represented in normalized image coordinates mathbf{y}, mathbf{y}' . The problem which the algorithm solves is to determine mathbf{E} for a set of matching image points. In practice, the image coordinates of the image points are affected by noise and the solution may also be over-determined which means that it may not be possible to find mathbf{E} which satisfies the above constraint exactly for all points. This issue is addressed in the second step of the algorithm. = Step 1: Formulating a homogeneous linear equation = With : mathbf{y} = begin{pmatrix} y_{1}  y_{2}  1 end{pmatrix} and mathbf{y}' = begin{pmatrix} y'_{1}  y'_{2}  1 end{pmatrix} and mathbf{E} = begin{pmatrix} e_{11} & e_{12} & e_{13}  e_{21} & e_{22} & e_{23}  e_{31} & e_{32} & e_{33} end{pmatrix} the constraint can also be rewritten as : y'_1 y_1 e_{11} + y'_1 y_2 e_{12} + y'_1 e_{13} + y'_2 y_1 e_{21} + y'_2 y_2 e_{22} + y'_2 e_{23} + y_1 e_{31} + y_2 e_{32} + e_{33} = 0 , or : mathbf{e} cdot tilde{mathbf{y}} = 0 where : tilde{mathbf{y}} = begin{pmatrix} y'_1 y_1  y'_1 y_2  y'_1  y'_2 y_1  y'_2 y_2  y'_2  y_1  y_2  1 end{pmatrix} and mathbf{e} = begin{pmatrix} e_{11}  e_{12}  e_{13}  e_{21}  e_{22}  e_{23}  e_{31}  e_{32}  e_{33} end{pmatrix} that is, mathbf{e} represents the essential matrix in the form of a 9-dimensional vector and this vector must be orthogonal to the vector tilde{mathbf{y}} which can be seen as a vector representation of the 3 times 3 matrix mathbf{y}' , mathbf{y}^{T} . Each pair of corresponding image points produces a vector tilde{mathbf{y}} . Given a set of 3D points mathbf{P}_k this corresponds to a set of vectors tilde{mathbf{y}}_{k} and all of them must satisfy : mathbf{e} cdot tilde{mathbf{y}}_{k} = 0 for the vector mathbf{e} . Given sufficiently many (at least eight) linearly independent vectors tilde{mathbf{y}}_{k} it is possible to determine mathbf{e} in a straightforward way. Collect all vectors tilde{mathbf{y}}_{k} as the columns of a matrix mathbf{Y} and it must then be the case that : mathbf{e}^{T} , mathbf{Y} = mathbf{0} This means that mathbf{e} is the solution to a homogeneous linear equation. = Step 2: Solving the equation = A standard approach to solving this equation implies that mathbf{e} is a left singular vector of mathbf{Y} corresponding to a singular value that equals zero. Provided that at least eight linearly independent vectors tilde{mathbf{y}}_{k} are used to construct mathbf{Y} it follows that this singular vector is unique (disregarding scalar multiplication) and, consequently, mathbf{e} and then mathbf{E} can be determined. In the case that more than eight corresponding points are used to construct mathbf{Y} it is possible that it does not have any singular value equal to zero. This case occurs in practice when the image coordinates are affected by various types of noise. A common approach to deal with this situation is to describe it as a total least squares problem; find mathbf{e} which minimizes :  mathbf{e}^{T} , mathbf{Y}  when  mathbf{e}  = 1 . The solution is to choose mathbf{e} as the left singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value of mathbf{Y} . A reordering of this mathbf{e} back into a 3 times 3 matrix gives the result of this step, here referred to as mathbf{E}_{rm est} . = Step 3: Enforcing the internal constraint = Another consequence of dealing with noisy image coordinates is that the resulting matrix may not satisfy the internal constraint of the essential matrix, that is, two of its singular values are equal and nonzero and the other is zero. Depending on the application, smaller or larger deviations from the internal constraint may or may not be a problem. If it is critical that the estimated matrix satisfies the internal constraints, this can be accomplished by finding the matrix mathbf{E}' of rank 2 which minimizes :  mathbf{E}' - mathbf{E}_{rm est}  where mathbf{E}_{rm est} is the resulting matrix from Step 2 and the Frobenius matrix norm is used. The solution to the problem is given by first computing a singular value decomposition of mathbf{E}_{rm est} : : mathbf{E}_{rm est} = mathbf{U} , mathbf{S} , mathbf{V}^{T} where mathbf{U}, mathbf{V} are orthogonal matrices and mathbf{S} is a diagonal matrix which contains the singular values of mathbf{E}_{rm est} . In the ideal case, one of the diagonal elements of mathbf{S} should be zero, or at least small compared to the other two which should be equal. In any case, set : mathbf{S}' = begin{pmatrix} s_1 & 0 & 0  0 & s_2 & 0  0 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix} , where s_1, s_2 are the largest and second largest singular values in mathbf{S} respectively. Finally, mathbf{E}' is given by : mathbf{E}' = mathbf{U} , mathbf{S}' , mathbf{V}^{T} The matrix mathbf{E}' is the resulting estimate of the essential matrix provided by the algorithm.  Determining R and t from E  This topic is covered in the page on the Essential matrix (section on determining R and t from E).  The normalized eight-point algorithm  The basic eight-point algorithm can in principle be used also for estimating the fundamental matrix mathbf{F} . The defining constraint for mathbf{F} is : (mathbf{y}')^{T} , mathbf{F} , mathbf{y} = 0 where mathbf{y}, mathbf{y}' are the homogeneous representations of corresponding image coordinates (not necessary normalized). This means that it is possible to form a matrix mathbf{Y} in a similar way as for the essential matrix and solve the equation : mathbf{f}^{T} , mathbf{Y} = mathbf{0} for mathbf{f} which is a reshaped version of mathbf{F} . By following the procedure outlined above, it is then possible to determine mathbf{F} from a set of eight matching points. In practice, however, the resulting fundamental matrix may not be useful for determining epipolar constraints. = The problem = The problem is that the resulting mathbf{Y} often is ill-conditioned. In theory, mathbf{Y} should have one singular value equal to zero and the rest are non-zero. In practice, however, some of the non-zero singular values can become small relative to the larger ones. If more than eight corresponding points are used to construct mathbf{Y} , where the coordinates are only approximately correct, there may not be a well- defined singular value which can be identified as approximately zero. Consequently, the solution of the homogeneous linear system of equations may not be sufficiently accurate to be useful. = What's causing the problem = Hartley addressed this estimation problem in his 1997 article. His analysis of the problem shows that the problem is caused by the poor distribution of the homogeneous image coordinates in their space, mathbb{R}^{3} . A typical homogeneous representation of the 2D image coordinate (y_{1}, y_{2}) , is : mathbf{y} = begin{pmatrix} y_{1}  y_{2}  1 end{pmatrix} where both y_{1}, y_{2} , lie in the range 0 to 1000‚Äì2000 for a modern digital camera. This means that the first two coordinates in mathbf{y} vary over a much larger range than the third coordinate. Furthermore, if the image points which are used to construct mathbf{Y} lie in a relatively small region of the image, for example at (700,700) pm (100,100) , , again the vector mathbf{y} points in more or less the same direction for all points. As a consequence, mathbf{Y} will have one large singular value and the remaining are small. = How it can be solved = As a solution to this problem, Hartley proposed that the coordinate system of each of the two images should be transformed, independently, into a new coordinate system according to the following principle. * The origin of the new coordinate system should be centered (have its origin) at the centroid (center of gravity) of the image points. This is accomplished by a translation of the original origin to the new one. * After the translation the coordinates are uniformly scaled so that the mean distance from the origin to a point equals sqrt{2} . This principle results, normally, in a distinct coordinate transformation for each of the two images. As a result, new homogeneous image coordinates mathbf{bar y}, mathbf{bar y}' are given by : mathbf{bar y} = mathbf{T} , mathbf{y} : mathbf{bar y}' = mathbf{T}' , mathbf{y}' where mathbf{T}, mathbf{T}' are the transformations (translation and scaling) from the old to the new normalized image coordinates. This normalization is only dependent on the image points which are used in a single image and is, in general, distinct from normalized image coordinates produced by a normalized camera. The epipolar constraint based on the fundamental matrix can now be rewritten as : 0 = (mathbf{bar y}')^{T} , ((mathbf{T}')^{T})^{-1} , mathbf{F} , mathbf{T}^{-1}, mathbf{bar y} = (mathbf{bar y}')^{T} , mathbf{bar F} , mathbf{bar y} where mathbf{bar F} = ((mathbf{T}')^{T})^{-1} , mathbf{F} , mathbf{T}^{-1} . This means that it is possible to use the normalized homogeneous image coordinates mathbf{bar y}, mathbf{bar y}' to estimate the transformed fundamental matrix mathbf{bar F} using the basic eight-point algorithm described above. The purpose of the normalization transformations is that the matrix mathbf{bar Y} , constructed from the normalized image coordinates, in general, has a better condition number than mathbf{Y} has. This means that the solution mathbf{bar f} is more well- defined as a solution of the homogeneous equation mathbf{bar Y} , mathbf{bar f} than mathbf{f} is relative to mathbf{Y} . Once mathbf{bar f} has been determined and reshaped into mathbf{bar F} the latter can be de-normalized to give mathbf{F} according to : mathbf{F} = (mathbf{T}')^{T} , mathbf{bar F} , mathbf{T} In general, this estimate of the fundamental matrix is a better one than would have been obtained by estimating from the un-normalized coordinates.  Using fewer than eight points  Each point pair contributes with one constraining equation on the element in mathbf{E} . Since mathbf{E} has five degrees of freedom it should therefore be sufficient with only five point pairs to determine mathbf{E} . Though possible from a theoretical point of view, the practical implementation of this is not straightforward and relies on solving various non-linear equations. Kaveh Fathian et al. proposed algorithms for five, six and seven points that circumvent the computation of the essential matrix by computing the rotation quaternion directly.

It contains the proteins RNA helicase B, RNase E and Polynucleotide phosphorylase. The store of cellular RNA in the cells is constantly fluctuating. For example, in Escherichia coli, Messenger RNA's life expectancy is between 2 and 25 minutes, in other bacteria it might last longer. Even in resting cells, RNA is degraded in a steady state, and the nucleotide products of this process are later reused for fresh rounds of nucleic acid synthesis. RNA turnover is very important for gene regulation and quality control. All organisms have various tools for RNA degradation, for instance ribonucleases, helicases, 3'-end nucleotidyltransferases (which add tails to transcripts), 5'-end capping and decapping enzymes and assorted RNA- binding proteins that help to model RNA for presentation as substrate or for recognition. Frequently, these proteins associate into stable complexes in which their activities are coordinate or cooperative. Many of these RNA metabolism proteins are represented in the components of the multi-enzyme RNA degradosome of Escherichia coli, which is constituted by four basic components: the hydrolytic endo-ribonuclease RNase E, the phosphorolytic exo- ribonuclease PNPase, the ATP-dependent RNA helicase (RhIB) and a glycolytic enzyme enolase. The RNA degradosome was discovered in two different laboratories while they were working on the purification and characterization of E. coli, RNase E and the factors that could have an influence on the activity of the RNA-degrading enzymes, concretely, PNPase. It was found while two of its major compounds were being studied.  Structure  The composition of this multienzyme may vary depending on the organism. The multiprotein complex RNA degradosome in E. coli consists of 4 canonical components: * RNase E: a large hydrolytic endo-ribonuclease that can be divided into the N-terminal half of RNase E, that contains the catalytic domain and is the place where the nucleotical activity resides; and the C-terminal half, which is a large chain unstructured protein without a known function that provides the scaffold needed for assembling the degradosome. This region is very flexible, which makes it easier for the components of degradosome to interact. In E. coli, RNase E is located in the cytoplasmatic membrane and can be observed by fluorescence microscopy. Its structure is conformed by 1061 amino acids and it has a molecular mass of 118 kDa. * PNPase: a phosphorolytic exo- ribonuclease that degrades RNA. Its chain has 421 amino acids and its molecular mass is 47 kDa. * Enolase: a glycolytic enzyme enolase formed by 432 amino acids, so its molecular mass is 46 kDa. * RNA helicase (RhlB): a big family of enzymes, this type has 711 amino acids and it weighs 77kDa. The identification of this DEAD-box protein (this type of proteins are involved in various metabolic processes that usually implicate RNAs) in the degradosome of E. coli was one of the first indicators that RNA helicases could possibly take part in the degradation of mRNA. There are some alternate forms of the RNA degradosome with different proteins that have been reported. Supplementary alternate degradosome components are PcnB (poly A polymerase) and the RNA helicases RhlE and SrmB. Other alternate components during cold shock include RNA helicase CsdA. Additional alternate degradosome components during stationary phase include Rnr (RNase R) and the putative RNA helicase HrpA. Ppk (polyphosphate kinase) is another constituent that has been reported to be part of the complex, the same as RNA chaperone Hfq, PAP (prostatic acid phosphatase), other kinds of chaperones and ribosomal proteins. These have been found in cell-extracted degradosome preparations from E. coli. This would represent the basic structure of RNA Degradosome. The structure has been drawn symmetrically, however, it's a dynamic structure so the noncatalytic region of RNase E would form a random coil, and each of these coils would act independently from the other ones. The structure of RNA degradosome is not as rigid as it seems to be in the picture because this one is only a model to understand how it works. The RNA degradosome's structure is dynamic and each component interacts with the components that are close to it. So the structure is like a molecular domain where RNA can interact as a substrate with each of the components and when this happens, it is really difficult for RNA to scape from the complex. Functions The RNA degradosome is a huge multi-enzyme association that is involved in RNA metabolism and post-transcriptional control of gene expression in numerous bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis. The multi-protein complex also serves as a machine for processing structured RNA precursors in the course of their maturation. RNA helicase is considered to help in the process of degradation to develop the double helix structure in RNA stem-loops. Occasionally, copurification of rRNA with degradosome is appreciated, which suggests that the complex may take part in rRNA and mRNA degradation. There is very little clear information about the role of degradosome. Looking into the steps of the degradation of a transcript in E. coli, what is known is that in the first place the endoribonucleases can cleave the substrates so that later the exoribonucleases can work on the products. RhIB has very little activity by itself but the interaction with RNAse E can stimulate it. The role of enolase in the degradation process of RNA is still not properly described, apparently it helps the complex to be more specific during the process of degradation. One particularly intriguing aspect of the bacterial RNA degradosome is the presence of metabolic enzymes in many of the studied complexes. In addition to the enolase enzyme present in the E. coli degradosome, the metabolic enzymes aconitase and phosphofructokinase have been identified in the C. crescentus and B. subtilis degradosomes respectively. The reason for the presence of these enzymes is currently unclear.  Degradosome activation  This multi- protein complex is stimulated by a non-coding RNA, called miRNA in Eukaryotic cells and sRNA in bacteria. Small sequences of aminoacid are usually used to target mRNA for its destruction. From here, there are two ways to do it: targeting translation-initiation region (TIR) or coding DNA sequence (CDS). Firstly, to attach sRNA to targeted mRNA a Hfq (chaperone protein) is needed. Once the attachment is done, if the complex Hfq-sRna ends on TIR, it blocks ribosome binding site (RBS) so ribosomes can not translate, and activates nucleases (RNase E) to eliminate mRNA. Another possibility is ending on another region, that makes the complex work as a finisher point of the translation. This way, the ribosomes can do their job of decoding, process that stops when they arrive to the complex, where all the destruction procedure is switched on.This picture shows RNA's degradation process with the specific phases.  RNA degradation  The RNA's destruction process is very complicated. To make it easier to understand, we use as an example the mRNA degradation procedure in Escherichia coli because it is the best known process. It is mediated mainly by endo- and ribo- nucleases. The enzymes RNase II and PNPase (polynucleotide phosphorylase) degrade mRNA in a 3'‚Üí5' way. The degradosome has 4 compartments that have several ribonucleases. Initially, the synthesized RNA is a polyphosphate structure. This is why the dephosphorylation is needed, in order to obtain monophosphate by the action of a RNA pyrophosphohydrolase PppH. The transcripts have two parts: the phosphate terminal (P-terminal) and a stem-loop structure as an end. The P-terminal is endoribonucleolytically cleavaged by RNase E, while the stem-loop is digested by RNA helicases. If there are any secondary structures, the performance of polymerase PAP is needed to simplify the reduction by exoribonucleases such as PNPase. Finally, the scraps are processed by oligoribonucleases. The process is analogous in other species and only changes in the enzymatic machinery. For example, bacillus subtilis instead of using RNase E as the endo-ribonuclease, it uses RNase Y or RNase J or in the archaea is used an exosome (vesicle) to this job. Evolution The degradosome, which is dynamic in conformation, variable in composition and non-essential under determined laboratory conditions, has nevertheless been maintained throughout the evolution of many bacterial species (Archaea, Eukaryote, Escherichia coli, Mitochondria, etc.), due most likely to its diverse contributions in global cellular regulation. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the presence of degradosome is a selective benefit for E. coli. Degradosome-like structures have been thought to be part of many Œ≥-proteobactria and have actually been found in other remote bacterial lineages. They are built upon RNase E. However, the composition of these degradosome-like assemblies is not always the same, it may be different on some proteic components. The RNA degradosome of E. coli Humans and other animals have E. coli as a commensal in their intestinal tract. It is one of the most studied organisms at laboratories and it has been a useful model for understanding genetic regulation in bacteria and other domains of life. The RNA degradosome of E. coli is a structure that plays diverse roles in RNA metabolism. It shares homologous components and functional analogy with similar assemblies found in all domains of life. One of its components is an ATP-dependent motor that is activated through protein- protein interactions and cooperates with the ribonucleases in an energy- dependent mode of RNA degradation. E. coli does not have a 5'‚Üí3' degradation pathway. Its mRNA does not have 5' capped ends and there are not any 5'‚Üí3' exonucleases known. The same thing happens to other eubacteria, hence the 5'‚Üí3' degradation pathway could be an exclusive treat of eukaryotic cells.

Little is known about his childhood. He is thought to have been born in or near the city of Cherkasy in Ukraine and that he learned to play the kobza and lute at the Hlukhiv Music Academy in Ukraine. He had an excellent voice and great musical aptitude. In 1725 he was invited to St Petersburg to sing in the Imperial Church Capella. In 1733 Tsarina Anna sent Bilohradsky to Dresden in the retinue of the ambassador Count Keyserlinck to perfect his lute playing under the tutelage of Silvius Leopold Weiss - the most important lutenist-composer of the 18th century. He also studied voice with Faustina Bordoni-Hasse, and castrato Domenico Annibali. Bilohradsky eventually became one of the highest trained musicians in the Russian Court Capella. In 1739 Bilohradsky returned to St Petersburg, where he continued to work as a court musician. In 1741 he returned to Germany where he became known as a virtuoso lutenist and singer and for some time lived in K√∂nigsberg where he had a number of students - notably Johann Reichardt (father of Johann Friedrich Reichardt), and Johann Georg Hamann, the Sturm-und-Drang philosopher. In his last years he lived in Petersburg. The \\"Moscow Weiss Manuscript\\" is ascribed to Bilohradsky or his circle. As a composer Bilohradsky is known for a set of songs and romances to the texts by Sumarokov that enjoyed considerable popularity in the 18th century. His niece Yelizaveta Belogradskaya became famous as a first Russian opera-singer, she sang at the Imperial St. Petersburg opera and was also known as a composer.

Guru Gobind Singh makes a reference to this battle in his victory letter Zafarnama. Preamble to the battle After Guru Gobind Singh left Anandpur Sahib on the night of December 5 and 6, 1704, they crossed the Sarsa river and while they were crossing the mughals and hill chiefs broke their oath and attacked the Sikhs. Many of the Sikhs had gotten scattered. They asked permission of the city chief for shelter to rest for the night in their garhi or haveli. The older brother thought giving him shelter would be dangerous so he refused. But the younger brother gave permission to let them stay there for the night. The battle Despite giving assurance of safe conduct, the Mughals soldiers were looking for Guru Gobind Singh, to take his head as a trophy. After learning that the party of Sikhs had taken shelter in the haveli, they planed laid siege upon it. The Sikh were aware of this so they went to the fort of chamkaur before the attack so they can be ready to fight the mughals. Aftermath When the Sikhs won the war the Mughals all ran away Guru Ji let them run and didn't chase them. Guru Gobind Singh made a last stand against the Mughals at Muktsar, but by then arungzeb was already defeated The Battle of Muktsar was the last battle fought by Guru Gobind Singh. The Guru emphasized how he was proud that his sons had died fighting in battle, and that he had 'thousands of sons ‚Äì the Singhs'. He also said that he would never trust Aurangzeb again due to his broken promises and lies. Zafarnama Zafarnama or \\"Epistle of Victory\\" is a letter that was written by Guru Gobind Singh to the then Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Zafarnama vividly describes what happened at Chamkaur, and also holds Aurangzeb responsible for what occurred and promises he broke: :13: Aurangzeb! I have no trust in your oaths anymore. (You have written that) God is one and that He is witness (between us). :14: I don't have trust equivalent to even a drop (of water) in your generals (who came to me with oaths on the Quran that I will be given safe passage out of Anandgarh Fort).

He has also developed activities as a curator, assistant curator and cultural manager. Juan Pablo Ballester graduated in 1990 from the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) in Havana, Cuba, and was member of the artistic group Grupo ABTV from 1988 to 1991. In 1992 he left Cuba and went into exile in Spain. In 1995 he co- organized the event and curated the exhibition Cuba: La Isla Posible (Cuba: The Possible Island) , the first multidisciplinary event that brought together Cuban artists, writers and intellectuals from the island and exile to debate the future of Cuban Culture, Centre de Cultura Contempor√†nia de Barcelona (CCCB), Barcelona, Spain. He was a recipient of Cintas Fellow 1998-99.Cintas Fellow 1998-99 https://cintasfoundation.org/component/tags/tag/1998-99 Since 2011 he lives in Miami.  Career  In his formative years, Juan Pablo Ballester trained within the ironic tactics to dismantle the official representations of national identity that the so-called Renaissance of the visual arts used to redefine the parameters of \\"revolutionary\\" art in Havana in the late 1980s. During his student years in the Fine Arts Faculty of the Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana, he developed well-known projects among which are El que imita fracasa (He Who Imitates Fails), 1988 (with Ileana Villaz√≥n); \\"Nosotros\\": Exposici√≥n Antol√≥gica de la obra de Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez (\\"We\\": An Anthological Exhibition of the Work of Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez), 1989 (with Grupo ABTV), and Homenaje to Hans Haacke (Homage to Hans Haacke), 1989 (with Grupo ABTV), an exhibition that despite having been censored by the Cuban authorities hours before its opening, still circulates among the island's artists as a legend. In his first years in Madrid, Ballester experienced the difficult experience of emigration and the need for integration, at the same time that he came into contact with the exotic tropical that surrounds the Spanish and European vision of his birthplace. During these years Ballester began working on a series of photographs documenting an ephemeral performance event about his identity, for which he used strategies such as appropriation, collage, manipulation and the use of the artist's body as a visual symbol. In his approach to photography Ballester does not undertake a critique of modernity and its foundations of unity and originality, but rather deconstructs the social rites behind the images, he distances himself from Cartier-Bresson's \\"decisive moment\\" to break the opacity of the historical narratives that take photography as proof of plausibility and social product. For Spanish critics and curators Juan Vicente Ali√°ga and Mar Villaespesa, ‚ÄúBallester's photographs taken in the 90s have been developed together with his subject (from the first one that refers to the insularity of Cuba and its social situation until its representation of the contingent subject) while at the same time exploring different crossroads, such as the condition of exile and sexual identity; crossroads between the public and the private, between the subject subject and the social self. The experiences reflected in his photographs refer to complex formulations that mix the physical, the biographical and the intimate but placing special emphasis on the sexed nature of all actions and on the consideration that even the most private aspect has a political or ideological interpretation\\". In 1994 he moved to Barcelona, where his experience of emigration would intensify when he was confronted with a society engaged in the search, construction and reaffirmation of an National identity encouraged from within government structures to differentiate itself from the Spanish state and the European context in which it finds itself submerged. Two large series of works are due to this time under the name Basado en hechos reales (Based on real events) and Enlloc, a Catalan language word that can be translated as Nowhere. During his years in Barcelona, Ballester carefully examined the institutional and aesthetic means by which a monolithic Catalan nationalism is communicated. In these works, Ballester reveals the iconography of internal, external Catalans and Xarnegos as fundamental to the visual definition of national identity that is supported by a variety of photographic genres, from advertising to postcards of monuments and snapshots of tourists. Ballester also used casting models from advertising agencies dressed as Mossos d'Esquadra (local police) as a fashion report in landscape settings - idyllic and idealized - prototypical of Catalan Noucentisme painting but using techniques that are common to many neo- objectivist photographers: long shots and centered camera positions, geometric composition, occasional subjects, as well as the symbolic load of the spaces chosen to transmit multiple layers of meaning. In these photographs Ballester addresses topics such as the (re) construction of identity, the temptation of the ethnographic, fictionalizations and historical patrimonializations, the invention of traditions, the resemantization and idealization of the common imaginary, or the exoticization and exoticism, it configures a framework of thought that clearly makes it impossible to read an image as a simple retinal effect alone. His photographic series are great fictional devices that do not demand a viewer as an author but a viewer as a producer of meaning. ‚ÄúThe result of this display of variety is a rhetorical stress on the role of photography in the taxonomic evaluation of a given territory and its people. Ballester is not attempting to engage the sympathies of viewers toward his band of outsiders ‚Äì he addresses the question of inclusion at another level, in a far more analytic manner. His work speaks from an outsider‚Äôs point of view, but does not cry out 'see me', but rather, 'see yourselves and what you look for.‚Äù Coco Fusco Selected Solo Exhibitions NoWhere (2013), Farside Gallery, Miami, FL; Enlloc (2005), Museo Pablo Serrano.

He did not participate in the 4000 metre steeplechase. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1900. Grant then dominated American distance running, as the national champion in the 1500 meter race from 1901 to 1903, the 5000 meter event in 1903 and 1904, the 10000 meter event in 1902 as well as the 3000 meter steeplechase in 1900. His record time in the 1500 meter event went unbroken in the U.S. for twenty years and in the world for ten years. He then went on to become a teacher at the Berkley School in New York, Detroit University, The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and then from 1914 on, at Episcopal Academy. Grant, along with George Orton and Josiah MacCracken, founded Camp Tecumseh, an all-boys summer camp in Moultonboro, New Hampshire. The camp opened in 1903. Grant continued as director of Camp Tecumseh until his death in 1946. After Grant's death, Camp Tecumseh became a not-for-profit organization run by a Board of Trustees. In 2003, Camp Tecumseh celebrated its 100th birthday.

It was recorded in 1971 and released the same year by record label Philips. It is also the only album on which producer Conny Plank is credited as a member.  Recording  Recorded in January 1971, Cluster began a transition away from the discordant industrial sound of their earlier group Kluster towards softer atmospheres. Thom Jurek of AllMusic describes Cluster as \\"a dislocating, disorienting meld of random space music, industrial noise, proto-ambient atmospherics, feedback and soundwash\\". Instrumentation included a pair of organs, Hawaiian guitar, cello and audio generators, all played by Moebius and Roedelius and all of which were electronically treated by Conny Plank. Spencer Grady of BBC Music stated that \\"far from providing mere background ambience, [the album's] rolling waves of hypnosis are continually exposed to perforation by disorienting surges of energy, imparting wake-up calls to comfort.  Release  Cluster was released in 1971 by record label Philips; Cluster's only release for the label. The album was reissued with new artwork and a new title, Cluster 71, by Sky Records in 1980. Cluster 71 was digitally remastered (from a vinyl source, not a tape) and reissued on CD in 1996 by Sky with new artwork: a total of three different cover designs for the album to date. It received its first U.S release in 2006 on the San Francisco based Water label. The Water reissue restored the original Philips cover art but retains the Cluster 71 name. A 1,000 copy limited remastered edition of Cluster 71 with the original Sky LP cover art was reissued by the Japanese Captain Trip label as a CD on September 20, 2007.

The town of Glenamaddy is reputed to get its name from the shape of the lake in winter, which is said to resemble a dog. Wildlife Many thousands of waterfowl come here each winter for food and shelter. Most numerous are the golden plover, which can be seen wheeling about in huge flocks. The Greenland white-fronted goose also comes but they number only 70 to 100 each winter. They breed in Greenland and over half their world population winters in Ireland.

Among the earliest women in the UK to pursue a career in surgery, at that time an almost entirely male-dominated profession, she was also the co-founder of the South London Hospital for Women and Children. Early life Born at Petworth in Sussex, her father, John Neville Colley Davies-Colley, was a surgeon at Guy's Hospital; her maternal grandfather, Thomas Turner, was also treasurer of that hospital. Her elder sister was the painter Frances Baker, and the feminist and publisher Harriet Weaver was her cousin. She studied at Baker Street High School for Girls and Queen's College, London. After leaving school, she at first worked with poor children in London's East End. Medical education and career Davies-Colley studied medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women (1902‚Äì7), achieving the MB BS degree in 1907, and was awarded the MD degree by the University of London in 1910. In 1911, she became the first female fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Davies-Colley's career as a surgeon spanned almost thirty years. On graduating in 1907, she became a house surgeon under Maud Chadburn (with whom she was to live and work for twenty-five years) at the New Hospital for Women, founded by Elizabeth Garrett Anderson; renamed the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital after Garrett Anderson's death in 1917, it is now part of the University College London Hospitals. She then became demonstrator in anatomy at the London School of Medicine and surgical registrar at the Royal Free Hospital. In addition to her work at the South London Hospital, in later life she was also a surgeon at the Marie Curie Cancer Hospital and senior obstetrician at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital. In 1917, she was one of the founding members of the Medical Women's Federation. South London Hospital for Women and Children Davies-Colley and her colleague Maud Chadburn began raising funds in 1911 for a new South London Hospital for Women and Children. At that time, such hospitals served the dual purpose of improving medical care for women and enhancing career prospects for female medical practitioners, as many hospitals refused to employ women. Aided by her cousin Harriet Weaver and other feminists, enough money was raised to open an outpatients' department in Newington Causeway in 1912. A purpose-built eighty-bed hospital on Clapham Common, staffed entirely by women, was opened by Queen Mary on 4 July 1916. Davies-Colley worked at the South London Hospital for Women and Children from its foundation until her death, holding various positions including senior surgeon. The hospital remained open until 1984. It was unusual in retaining the women-only staffing policy, initiated by Davies-Colley and Chadburn, right up until closure. Death and legacy Davies-Colley died suddenly of thyroid toxaemia in London in 1934. One of the Royal College of Surgeons' lecture theatres at Lincoln's Inn Fields was refurbished and dedicated in Eleanor Davies-Colley's memory in 2004, with the aim of celebrating the role of women in surgery and encouraging more women to enter the profession. A major fundraising drive (led by another pioneering woman surgeon, Averil Mansfield, the first woman to become a professor of surgery in the UK) raised nearly a quarter of a million pounds for the project. The lecture theatre contains a visual representation featuring Eleanor Davies-Colley and other pioneering female surgeons.

It is one of the service agencies of the Department of Science and Technology. PHIVOLCS monitors volcano, earthquake, and tsunami activity, and issues warnings as necessary. It is mandated to mitigate disasters that may arise from such volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other related geotectonic phenomena. History This government organization was formed after a historical merging of official functions of government institutions. One of its first predecessors is the Philippine Weather Bureau created in 1901 when meteorological, seismological and terrestrial magnetic services of the Manila Observatory were transferred from the Roman Catholic Church to the American Colonial Government. It performed earthquake monitoring in the country and has inherited and maintained the early earthquake catalogue at that time. By 1972, the Philippine Weather Bureau was reorganized under Presidential Decree No. 78 into the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). A UNDP-funded project for PAGASA established a twelve-station earthquake monitoring network in the country. The other predecessor to PHIVOLCS, the Commission on Volcanology (COMVOL) was created on June 20, 1952 by Republic Act no. 766 after the disastrous eruption of Hibok-Hibok Volcano in 1952. Under Executive Order no. 784 of March 17, 1982, the umbrella department of COMVOL, the National Science Development Board (NSDB) was reorganized into the National Science and Technology Authority (NSTA), and COMVOL was restructured to become the Philippine Institute of Volcanology or PHIVOLC. The seismological arm of PAGASA was officially transferred to PHIVOLC on September 17, 1984, renaming the institute as the Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology or PHIVOLCS. NSTA, the umbrella department for PHIVOLCS and PAGASA, became the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in 1987. The technical staff and the 12-station earthquake monitoring network was fully integrated to PHIVOLCS in 1988. PHIVOLCS was headed by Raymundo Punongbayan from 1982 to 2003, and it is currently headed by Renato U. Solidum Jr. from 2003 to the present.

Georges produced $1 billion of damage to the island and killed over 380 people. 7000 people evacuated to six shelters in the capital city of Santo Domingo. Supplies came from countries including the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Canada, Chile and others. Hurricane Georges had just recently reached Category 3-status when it made landfall on the island and became the worst storm to affect the island since Hurricane David made a direct landfall in 1979. Background alt=A map of a path across a portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The track starts near the Cape Verde Islands, and heads generally west-northwestward. South America is depicted on the lower-left side of the map. Hurricane Georges began as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September 16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September 20 with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Over the following five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, causing over 600 fatalities, mainly in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. By September 25, Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm made landfall three days later near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed to an eastward drift. Georges dissipated on October 1 near the Atlantic coast of Florida.  Preparations  As Hurricane Georges proceeded westward, the National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Watch for the island late on September 20. The hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning soon after which persisted until September 23 when Georges passed. The civil defense, national emergency response team, the Red Cross, police, firefighters and the Health Ministry were dispatched for Hurricane Georges preparations. Air traffic was halted and ships were told to stay in their ports. Dominican Republic residents boarded up their windows and doors to protect against the oncoming hurricane. The National Hurricane Center had predicted that as the eye of the storm moved across the island there would be rains of 5-10 inches with more in certain areas. The storm surge was predicted to be 4‚Äì7 feet high and expected to batter the coastline. Isolated tornadoes were also predicted on September 22.  Impact  Georges dumped major amounts of rainfall over the island, peaking at 53 centimeters in Polo. The National Hurricane Center did not get an official amount, but estimates recorded an amount around on the island alone. In the Dominican Republic, Georges brought very strong winds, heavy rains and a moderate storm surge. Nearly 10 hours of rainfall created mudslides and overflown rivers across the mountainous country, damaging many cities along the southern coast, including the capital, Santo Domingo. 120 mph (195 km/h) winds downed and uprooted trees across much of the country, littering streets with debris and mud. Thousands of houses were destroyed, while many were completely destroyed from the flooding and winds. The whole country was stripped of electricity during the aftermath of the storm, which damaged water and communication systems. Toppled trees blocked hundreds of streets in Santo Domingo After Georges passed over the Dominican Republic, 438 people were confirmed dead or missing with another 155,000 people to be homeless. Six women and children were killed when a youth hostel fell into the Ozama River, which was overswelling. 20 people were reported dead in the Azua Province in the Dominican Republic. Rescue workers were also searching for 30 children who went missing at a school in Cambita, which is from Santo Domingo. 500,000 people were left injured. 2000 people went missing in the town of Mesopotamia, which is surrounded by the Yaque del Sur and San Juan Rivers after the republic's officials opened the nearby dam without evacuating villagers beforehand. Water damage left many of the island's roads inpassable, which left people isolated in villages without the correct necessities. 70%,or 112, of bridges in the Dominican Republic were destroyed. A Dominican economist, Felix Calvo estimated that the storm did about $6 billion (1998 USD) in damage to the island. The island's agriculture and tourism system suffered greatly. In the Dominican Republic, 55% of the agricultural system was lost, partly from mudslides, flash floods and river valleys. 90% of all of the plantations in the area were destroyed. Rice, bananas and cavassas, the most basic foods on the island, were hit hard. Large pastures for animals were destroy as well as poultry and other necessities. The damage to farmland and agriculture would total out to about $434 million (1998 USD). Damage and repairs to houses and public buildings was to reach over $400 million. Damage to the electrical system on Dominican Republic totalled out to $107 million (1998 USD). Flooding and wind damage from Hurricane Georges caused major damage to the island's major airport in Santo Domingo.  Aftermath  After Georges had passed by, the Dominican government declared that waterborne diseases, malaria, and dengue fever were major health concerns. The Dominican Republic Tourism Association found that less than the feared amount of tourism facilities were affected by Georges. The BHR/OFDA assisted in helping out the Dominican Republic to repair after Georges. One Chargee d'Affaires declared the island as a disaster area. The organization sent $25,000 (1998 USD) to support purchasing of water purifying supplies, emergency construction materials and many chainsaws. They then sent three airplane flights to deliver body bags, plastic sheeting, five-gallon water jugs, water bladders and chainsaws. Two of the planes arrived on September 25, 1998 while the last one arrived the day after. The supplies sent by BHR/OFDA were controlled by the Dominican Red Cross. More plastic sheeting was sent on September 27 by a United States Military aircraft. The BHR/OFDA also supplied money for eight helicopters, six of which were blackhawks. The helicopters were used for two weeks and cost $1.2 million. On September 29, the organization contributed $300,000 at a request by PAHO. Part of that money was transferred to support a Peace Corps project to send 21,000 packages of pre- prepared foods for the island. 150,000 cubic meters of garbage was spread around the country's capital of Santo Domingo. The armed forces in the country went to clean up the mess, as well as an inter-institutional committee, which was formed just for the case. The BDR/OFDA obligated another $260,000 for a set of 100 500-gallon water tanks, 10 generators to power municipal water pumps, and many seeds to replant the country's agricultural system. The BDR/OFDA's assistance in the Dominican Republic ended on October 8, 1998 with control being taken over by the USG Corporation. Most impacted by Hurricane Georges was the agricultural industry. The areas hardest hit by the hurricane coincided with the country's main crop-growing areas, including the provinces around Santo Domingo. After a severe drought in 1997, extreme rainfall damaged around of food crops. Substantial amounts of tobacco and sugar plantations were severely damaged. The extreme flooding caused great losses in the poultry industry, an important economy in the area. The island had to import significant amounts of rice and other crops to compensate for the losses from other countries. The World Bank donated $111 million to a $125 million project which was to re-stabilize the Dominican Republic after Hurricane Georges. The World Bank had concluded that a lack of emergency management skills were used during Hurricane Georges. The population was not warned correctly of the impending storm, causing the preparations to be insufficient. The first component of the project was to quickly disperse $60 million for necessary items of recovery such as medicine, housing materials and chemical products. Another component was to fix the bridges and roads in the Dominican Republic, irrigation issues, electricity and hurricane preparedness.

Biography Grindley was born November 8, 1864 in Laxey on the Isle of Man. He was educated there and immigrated to Canada in 1882. He moved to the country's west as a trading agent for the Chipman Brother of Halifax. He joined the military and took part in suppressing the North-West Rebellion in 1885, serving under Sam Steele. In 1886, he left the Chipam Brothers and opened a general store in Fort Saskatchewan, where he also served as a school trustee. The following year, he became buyer and manager for Ross Brothers Hardware Company, co-owned by James Ross. In 1888 he married Mary Jane Furnivale, with whom he would have two children. In 1903 he left the Ross Brothers to join the Revillon Brothers, where he remained until 1905 when he established Gorman, Clancey & Grindley, a mercantile house in Edmonton. In the 1904 municipal election, Grindley ran for alderman on Edmonton City Council. He finished ninth of seventeen candidates, and was defeated. He was more successful in the 1910 election, when he finished second of eleven candidates and was elected to what was intended to be a two year term. However, Edmonton's merger with Strathcona necessitated an entire new Council to be elected in February 1912, and Grindley's term was truncated. He was unsuccessful in his attempts to win it back, as he finished fourteenth of eighteen candidates. While residing in Edmonton, Grindley built a large mansion, now known as the Grindley Suites, on 121 Street and 102 Ave. Although his ownership of the building was short lived, the building itself has a rich history, which includes housing the Edmonton Grads, an internationally successful women's basketball team. Grindley was involved with the Anglican Church, the Freemasons, and the Liberal Party.

The Texas Military Forces have a budget of $101.1 million as of 2017. Current forces include the Texas Army National Guard, Texas Air National Guard, and Texas State Guard of the Texas Militia. Former forces include the Texian Militia, Texian Army, Texian Navy, Texas Army, Texas Navy, and Texas Marines. It also included the Texas Rangers from their inception until 1935. The Texas Military Forces are administered by the Texas Military Department under command of the Adjutant General of Texas, who is appointed by and subordinate to the Governor of Texas, the Commander in Chief.  History  Texas Military Forces are inextricably linked and have served an integral role in the development, history, culture, and international reputation of Texas. They were established with the Texian Militia in 1823 (thirteen years before the Republic of Texas and twenty-two years before the State of Texas) by Stephen Austin to defend the Old Three Hundred in the Colony of Texas. Texas Military Forces sparked the Texas Revolution at the Battle of Velasco and became legendary at the Battle of Gonzales (the \\"Lexington of Texas\\"). Their legend continued at their defeat by Mexican forces at Siege of the Alamo, with events such as the Immortal 32 and To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World, which resulted in one of the most notable last stands in history. As of 2018, the Alamo Mission is the most visited tourist attraction in Texas and one of ten manmade UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United States. The Texas Military's legend was sealed at the Battle of San Jacinto when they defeated Santa Anna's army in eighteen minutes, achieving independence from the Centralist Republic of Mexico and establishing the Republic of Texas; one of three colonies to win independence without foreign aid in world history and the only American state (the Thirteen Colonies were aided by France, and the California Republic and Republic of Hawaii were aided by the United States). The artillery used during the battle, the Twin Sisters, are considered the \\"Holy Grail of Texas\\". During the 19th Century, the Texas Rangers service in the Texas-Indians Wars and fighting outlaws significantly contributed to the folklore of the \\"Wild West\\". During the American Civil War, Texas Military Forces served under the command of Union and Confederate militaries. When the first units reached Virginia, Jefferson Davis greeted them by declaring: \\"Texans! The troops of other states have their reputations to gain, but the sons of the defenders of the Alamo have theirs to maintain.\\" The Texas Brigade achieved distinction as Confederate shock troops, while the Davis Guards maintained Texas as the only Confederate State unconquered by the Union with their victory at Second Battle of Sabine Pass. It is referred to as the \\"Thermopylae of the Confederacy\\" and the most one-sided Confederate victory of the war. Texas Military Forces also achieved distinction fighting and winning the last engagement of the war at the Battle of Palemito Ranch. Texas Military Forces have not waged a domestic combat operation since the 19th century. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, they have been primarily engaged in military operations other than war, including manmade and natural disaster operations, search and rescue operations, counterdrug operations, and border security operations. Most notably, the Mexican Drug War, Texas City Disaster, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, Bastrop County Complex Fire, Operation Jump Start, Operation Phalanx, and Operation Faithful Patriot. Under command of the United States Department of Defense, Texas Military Forces have served in the Mexican War, Spanish War, Philippine War, Mexican Expedition, World War I, World War II, Cold War (Korea and Vietnam campaigns), and War on Terror. Since the September 11 attacks, Texas Military units have been deployed for the War on Terror more than any other state.  Administration  Texas Military Forces are administered by the Texas Military Department under command of the Adjutant General of Texas, who is appointed by and subordinate to the Governor of Texas, the Commander in Chief.  Authority  Texas Military Forces exist under civilian control. Since 1903, Texas Military Forces are authorized by Title 32 of the United States Code and Article 4 of the Texas Constitution to \\"execute the laws of the State, to suppress insurrections, and to repel invasions.\\" Texas Army National Guard and Texas Air National Guard units are also subject to Title 10 of the United States Code, which legally empowers the United States government to mobilize them when more resources are needed than available in the United States Armed Forces for war, national emergency, or national security. Under Title 10, operations are conducted under command of the United States Department of Defense by the Secretary of Defense.  Award and decorations  Awards and decorations of the Texas Military are the medals, ribbons, badges, tabs, trophies, plaques, certificates, memorials, and monuments that recognize service and achievement while serving in the Texas Military Forces.  Conflicts  The history of conflicts involving the Texas Military Forces spans nearly two centuries, from 1823 to the present, under the command authority (the ultimate source of lawful military orders) of four governments including the Texan government (in 3 incarnations), the U.S. government, the Mexican government, and the Confederate regime.  Units  Texas Military Forces have undergone many re-designations, reorganizations, and reformations since 1823. Since 1846, Texas Militia units constitute the entirety of the Texas Military Forces. = Current forces = Texas Army National Guard The Texas Army National Guard is the current land warfare branch of the Texas Military Forces for the State of Texas. Its major units include the 36th Infantry Division, the 56th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 72nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, the 36th Combat Aviation Brigade, the 71st Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, the 36th Sustainment Brigade, the 176th Engineer Brigade, the 136th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, the 136th Expeditionary Signal Battalion, and the 136th Regiment (CA) (RTI). Texas Air National Guard The Texas Air National Guard is the current air warfare branch of the Texas Military Forces for the State of Texas. It is composed of the 149th Fighter Wing, the 136th Airlift Wing, the 147th Attack Wing, the 254th Combat Communications Group, the 272nd Engineering Installation Squadron, and the 204th Security Forces Squadron. The 149th Fighter Wing prepares pilots for combat, the 136th Airlift Wing flies C-130s in-and out of theater and the 147th Reconnaissance Wing has recently acquired Predators to be the eyes in the hostile sky. Texas State Guard The Texas State Guard is the current state defense force branch of the Texas Military Forces for the State of Texas. It assists and augments Texas military and civil authorities in times of state emergencies, and in on-going support of National Guard units and local communities. = Former forces =  Texian Militia  The Texian Militia was the militia forces of the Texian Colony from 1823 to 1835 and the inaugurate force of the Texas Military. It was established by Stephen F. Austin on August 5, 1823 for defense of the Old Three Hundred colonists against the Karankawa, Comanche, and Cherokee tribes; among others. Its most notable unit, the Texas Rangers, remained in continuous service of Texas Military Forces until 1935.  Texas Rangers  The Texas Rangers were established as a unit of the Texian Militia in the Texian Colony. During the Texas Revolution, it served as a unit of the Texian Army providing cavalry and conducting special operations such as demolition of Vince's Bridge. During the Republic of Texas, it continued to serve as a special forces unit employing guerrilla warfare in the Texas-Indian Wars.  Texian Army  The Texian Army, also known as the Revolutionary Army and Army of the People, was the land warfare branch of the Texian armed forces during the Texas Revolution. It spontaneously formed from the Texian Militia in October 1835 following the Battle of Gonzales. Along with the Texian Navy, it helped the Republic of Texas win independence from the Centralist Republic of Mexico on May 14, 1836 at the Treaties of Velasco. Although the Texas Army was officially established by the Consultation of the Republic of Texas on November 13, 1835, it did not replace the Texian Army until after the Battle of San Jacinto.  Texian Navy  The Texian Navy, also known as the Revolutionary Navy and First Texas Navy, was the naval warfare branch of the Texian armed forces during the Texas Revolution. It was established by the Consultation of the Republic of Texas on November 25, 1835. Along with the Texian Army, it helped the Republic of Texas win independence from the Centralist Republic of Mexico on May 14, 1836 at the Treaties of Velasco. It was replaced by the Texas Navy on March 23, 1839.  Texas Army  The Texas Army, officially the Army of the Republic of Texas, was the land warfare branch of the Texas Military Forces during the Republic of Texas. It descended from the Texian Army, which was established in October 1835 to fight for independence from Centralist Republic of Mexico in the Texas Revolution. The Texas Army was provisionally formed by the Consultation in November 1835, however it did not replace the Texian Army until after the Battle of San Jacinto. The Texas Army, Texas Navy, and Texas Militia were officially established on September 5, 1836 in Article II of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. The Texas Army and Texas Navy were merged with the United States Armed Forces on February 19, 1846 after the Republic of Texas became the 28th state of America.  Texas Navy  The Texas Navy, officially the Navy of the Republic of Texas, also known as the Second Texas Navy, was the naval warfare branch of the Texas Military Forces during the Republic of Texas. It descended from the Texian Navy, which was established in November 1835 to fight for independence from Centralist Republic of Mexico in the Texas Revolution. The Texas Navy, Texas Army, and Texas Militia were officially established on September 5, 1836 in Article II of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. The Texas Navy and Texas Army were merged with the United States Armed Forces on February 19, 1846 after the Republic of Texas became the 28th state of America.  Texas Marines  The Texas Marines, officially the Marine Corps of the Republic of Texas, were the naval infantry of the Texas Navy tasked with enforcing discipline aboard ships, providing security at shore stations, sharpshooting, and naval boarding. It was officially established on January 14, 1836 and modeled after the United States Marines Corps.  Texas Militia  Since 1846, Texas Militia units have constituted the entirety of the Texas Military Forces. Current units are the Texas Army National Guard, Texas Air National Guard, and Texas State Guard. Former units include the Texas Home Guard/State Troops (1861-65), Texas Volunteer Guard (1871-1904), Texas Reserve Militia (1905-1913), Texas Home Guard (1914-1918), Texas Reserve Militia (1919-1940), Texas Defense/State Guard (1941-45), and Texas State Guard Reserve Corps (1945-1965).

Using a combination of restriction enzymes some of which are specific to DNA modifications, the technique can be used to visualize differences in methylation levels across the genome of a given organism. RLGS employs direct labeling of DNA, which is first cut by a specific series of restriction enzymes, and then labeled by a radioactive isotope (usually phosphorus-32). A two-dimensional electrophoresis process is then employed, yielding high- resolution results. The radioactive second-dimension gel is then allowed to expose a large sheet of film. The radiation produced by the radioactive labeling will cause the film to be exposed wherever the restriction fragments have migrated during electrophoresis. The film is then developed, yielding a visual representation of the results in the form of an autoradiograph. The same combination of restriction enzymes will produce the same pattern of 'spots' from samples from the same organisms, but different patterns for different types of organism. For example, human and mouse DNA will produce distinctly different patterns when treated with the same combination of enzymes. These finished auto-rads can be examined against each other, revealing any changes in gene expression that lead to visual differences in the film. Each autoradiograph contains thousands of spots, each corresponding to a labeled DNA restriction landmark. RLGS becomes useful when doing whole- genome scans, and can effectively do the work of thousands of polymerase chain reactions at once. It readily detects alterations deviating from normal, and thus is exceptionally effective in identifying hyper/hypomethylation in tumors, deletions or amplifications of genes, or simply changes in gene expression throughout the development of an organism.

He was the father of Sir Leander Starr Jameson, South African statesman and prime minister, and the nephew of Professor Robert Jameson of the University of Edinburgh. Born in Edinburgh in 1805, Robert William was the son of Thomas Jameson, a wealthy shipowner, merchant and burgess of the city of Edinburgh, as recorded in Colvin, Vol. 1: 1-2 (1922). Colvin writes of Robert William's father and grandfather, both of whom were named Thomas Jameson, that: \\"These Jamesons came, so the tradition goes, from the Shetland Islands; and both their origin and their crest, a ship in full sail, with Sine Metu for motto, suggest that they once followed a seafaring life. But they had been long settled in Leith and Edinburgh.\\" (Colvin, 1922, Vol.1:1). In 1835 Robert William Jameson married Christian Pringle, daughter of Major-General Pringle of Symington and his wife Christian Watson. The Jamesons had eleven children, of whom Leander Starr was the youngest, born on 9 February 1853. Having first pursued a career as a Writer to the Signet in Edinburgh, Robert William's interest in journalism was recognised by his Whig friend and patron the Earl of Stair, who in 1854 made him Editor of the Wigtownshire Free Press, the headquarters of which was based in Stranraer, to which the family moved from Edinburgh, remaining there until 1860. Robert William was a radical and free thinker, author of the dramatic poem Nimrod, published in 1848 and of the play Timolean, a tragedy in five acts, published and performed at the Adelphi Theatre in Edinburgh in 1852. Timolean, inspired by liberal anti-slavery views of the era, was popular with audiences and ran to a second edition within the first year of publication. In 1854 Jameson published the novel The Curse of Gold. Writing for The Scotsman in 1922, W.Forbes Gray observed of Robert William Jameson that: \\"There was probably no better known man in Edinburgh in the earlier part of the last century than Robert William Jameson, W.S., the father of the South African statesman whose biography is reviewed in your columns to-day. When the agitation for Parliamentary and municipal reform was at its height, Jameson, who was a sturdy Radical and a violent opponent of the Corn Law, ranged himself alongside of Adam Black, and was able as well as indefatigable in his advocacy of the policy of the 'clean slate'. Lord Chancellor Campbell considered Jameson the best hustings speaker he ever heard. Jameson was prominent at most of the public meetings of that time, and when the citizens of Edinburgh gave their feelings over the rejection of the first Reform Bill by the House of Lords, Jameson was one of the speakers at a mass meeting in the King's Park, attended by about 50,000 people. He was also an ardent municipal reformer, and was among those chosen at the first election of the reformed Town Council of Edinburgh. In 1835 Councillor Jameson opposed a proposal that the College Committee of the Town Council should supervise the teaching given in the University.\\" Robert William and his family moved to Chelsea and Kensington in London in 1861, where he died in 1868.

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle ran for re-election to a fourth term, but was narrowly defeated by Republican John Thune. Daschle was the only incumbent U.S. Senator to lose re-election in the 2004 election cycle.  Major candidates  = Democratic = * Tom Daschle, incumbent U.S. Senator and Senate Minority Leader = Republican = * John Thune, former U.S. Representative and nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2002  Campaign  In the 2004 Congressional elections, Daschle lost his seat to Republican challenger and former U.S. Representative John Thune in a bitterly contested battle. Thune prevailed by a narrow 50.6‚Äì49.4% margin, of 4,508 votes. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that one party's leader in the Senate would not campaign directly for the other's defeat. Daschle's loss resulted in the first ousting of a majority or minority leader since 1952 when Arizona Senator Ernest McFarland lost his seat to Barry Goldwater. He was the only incumbent Senator from either party to lose reelection in 2004. Throughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President George W. Bush, and Vice President Dick Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the \\"chief obstructionist\\" of Bush's agenda and charged him with using filibusters to block confirmation of several of Bush's nominees to the federal judiciary. Thune also used moral values such as issues surrounding same-sex marriage and abortion to convince South Dakota voters that Daschle's positions on such topics were out-of-sync with the state's residents. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the President while blasting Daschle for his vehement opposition to Bush. He attempted to sway voters by remembering that Bush won South Dakota in a landslide in 2000 and had a very high job-approval rating among South Dakotans. His opponent, the Minority Leader, repeatedly argued that he was funneling money into South Dakota for vital federal highway and water pet projects. Daschle responded to Thune's claim that he was a partisan anti-Bush obstructionist by pointing to his action just nine days after the September 11 attacks when he hugged President Bush on the Senate floor following Bush's address to Congress and the nation. He also hit back by alleging that Thune wanted to \\"rubber stamp what the administration is doing.\\" Daschle's use of the video of his embrace of Bush forced the Republican National Committee to demand that the ad be pulled, claiming that it suggests that Bush endorses Daschle. Shortly following the airing of the ad, in a nationally televised debate on NBC's Meet the Press, Thune accused Daschle of \\"emboldening the enemy\\" in his skepticism of the Iraq War. Daschle also noticeably relied very heavily on the power of incumbency to win a fourth term. Some also argued that Stephanie Herseth's election to the state's only House seat hurt Daschle, as voters may not have been comfortable sending an all-Democratic delegation to Congress for the first time in many decades. Accusations that Daschle was possibly considering no longer being an official resident of South Dakota was believed to have offended voters there. Others have analyzed that Daschle's lengthy consideration and eventual rejection of a potential run for the presidency in 2004 took a toll on South Dakotans, who felt betrayed and used by Daschle as a result. When the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7 points in January and February. By May, his lead minimized to just 2 points and into the summer polls showed a varying number of trends: either Daschle held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or Thune held a slim 1- to 2-point lead or the race was tied right down the middle. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2 to 5 percent while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49-49 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins. Thune was an aide to former Senator James Abdnor, the man Daschle defeated in 1986 to gain his seat in the Senate. Daschle spent a great deal of time and energy campaigning for his fellow Democrat Tim Johnson in 2002, who barely defeated Thune by 524 votes. He argued that by re-electing Johnson, South Dakota would be better off because Johnson would help to keep Daschle Majority Leader. However, in the end, while Johnson won, other states voted for enough Republicans that Daschle was no longer majority leader. Furthermore, Thune's whisker-close defeat in 2002 freed him up to run against Daschle in 2004. Had Daschle not put his considerable weight to re-electing Johnson, it seems very likely that Thune would have beaten Johnson, leaving Daschle without a strong challenger for the upcoming election and making his re-election a certainty. During Daschle's farewell Address on November 19th, 2004, he received a standing ovation from the Senate floor. His term as South Dakota‚Äôs senator expired on January 3rd, 2005, with the commencement of the 109th Congress. Harry Reid took over as Minority Leader, and became Majority Leader in 2007.

It is the historical seat of the Pope of Alexandria, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church. On Palm Sunday, 9 April 2017, an Islamic State operative detonated his suicide belt in the cathedral, killing 17 people and wounding 48. Beginning The cathedral is said to stand on the site of the church founded by St. Mark the Evangelist in AD 42. St. Mark the Evangelist (author of the second Gospel) has been connected with the city of Alexandria since earliest Christian tradition. Coptic Christians believe he arrived in Alexandria around AD 42 and stayed for about seven years. During this time, Mark converted many to Christianity and performed many miracles. He is considered the founder of the church in Alexandria and the first Bishop of Alexandria. According to tradition, St. Mark was arrested during a festival of Serapis in AD 68 and martyred by being dragged through the streets. He was buried under the church he had founded. Relics of Saint Mark In 828, relics believed to be the body of St. Mark were stolen from Alexandria by Venetian merchants and taken to Venice. Copts believe that the head of St. Mark remains in a church named after him in Alexandria, and parts of his relics are in St. Mark's Cairo's Cathedral. The rest of what are believed to be his relics are in the St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Italy. Every year, on the 30th day of the month of Paopi, the Coptic Orthodox Church celebrates the commemoration of the consecration of the church of St. Mark, and the appearance of the head of the saint in the city of Alexandria. This takes place inside St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, where the saint's head is preserved. The head of St. Mark was moved around a great deal over the centuries, and has been lost for over 250 years. Some of the relics from the body of St. Mark, however, were returned to Alexandria from Rome in 1968 during the papacy of Coptic Pope Cyril VI. The present St. Mark's Coptic Cathedral is of recent date, but is said to stand on the site of church founded by St. Mark himself. History Facade of the cathedral. In AD 311, before the martyrdom of Pope Peter the Last of Martyrs, he prayed a last prayer on the grave of Saint Mark, the church was then a little chapel on the eastern coast, and it contained bodies said to be of Saint Mark and some of his holy successors. The church was later enlarged in the days of Pope Achillas, the 18th Pope. The church was greatly ruined in 641 when the Arabs invaded Egypt. In 680 Pope John III rebuilt the church. In 828, the body of Saint Mark was stolen by Italian sailors and was taken from Alexandria to Venice in Italy. However, Saint Mark's head remained in Alexandria. The church was destroyed again in 1219, during the time of the crusades, then it was rebuilt once more. Sixteenth-century French explorer Pierre Belon mentions the founding of the church in 1547. The church was pulled down during the French invasion of Alexandria in July 1798. The church was rebuilt and opened in 1819 by Pope Peter El Gawly in the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha. The church was renewed in the time of Pope Demetrius II and by the supervision of Bishop Marcos of El Behira in 1870. Between the years 1950‚Äì1952, in the time of Pope Yusab II, the church building was pulled down and another, larger building was built with reinforced concrete after the basilique style. The six marble pillars were transferred into the outer entrance of the church. The icon carrier was accurately cut into parts, each part given a number, and then it was cautiously returned to where it was originally. The two bell tower were not pulled down as they were reinforced with concrete and were decorated with beautiful Coptic engravings. Two new bells ‚Äì brought from Italy ‚Äì were provided, one for each bell tower. Between 1985 and 1990, the church was widened from the western side after the former style with great accuracy, keeping the two bell tower in their places, so the entire area of the church was doubled. The six pillars were transferred to the new western entrance of the church supervised by Pope Shenouda III.

This created town of Calumet was chosen to be the film's central location so that it could be related to almost anywhere in the US, an ambiguous American township with deliberately vague landmarks and names.

He also competed in the first four Boston Marathons, one of only two athletes (the other being Lawrence Bragnolia) to have done so. Grant was the son of a Presbyterian minister, born in the small farming community of Dufferin, in Haldimand County, Ontario, about three miles east of the Six Nations reserve where Tom Longboat lived. The community no longer exists, although it continued to act as a New York Central Railway stop before that line was decommissioned. As a result, Grant's birthplace is sometimes incorrectly attributed to other locations in Canada with the same name. The family moved to St. Mary's, Perth County, Ontario in the 1880s. Grant attended the University of Toronto as an undergraduate, and was a member of the Toronto Lacrosse Club. He then attended Harvard University Medical School in Cambridge, Massachusetts beginning about 1895, and enrolled in the track team there as a miler, running 4:25 for the distance. Grant's education at Harvard was self-funded, and he had to work in order to earn his tuition. His enrollment at the Medical School had frequent interruptions as a result. Grant entered the inaugural Boston Marathon in 1897 with a solid background in track racing, but without having previously engaged in any long runs. His entry contravened orders he had received from his track team at Harvard, which wanted him to be fresh for a dual meet with the University of Pennsylvania. He was the only man in a field of eighteen runners without a handler accompanying him on a bicycle to provide him with water and to attend to his needs. Grant nonetheless took the lead immediately. He was joined by cross-country runner Hamilton Gray from New York City, and they shared the lead for about twelve miles until John J. McDermott caught the pair on the downhill into Newton Lower Falls. Gray stopped to walk, but Grant gave chase for a mile until the base of the next hill was reached. There, Grant walked to the top of the hill. Seeing a street-watering cart, used to keep the dust down on the dirt streets, he asked the driver to run water over him. Once his legs had cooled down, he tried to run again, but his feet were too blistered to continue, and he dropped out with about nine miles to go. McDermott continued on to win the race. He was effusive in his praise for Grant; \\"He is the hardest man I ever beat,\\" he said. \\"He held me for a mile, although he was all pumped out. If he had trained for the race he would have given me a hard race. As it was it was hard enough to shake him. He ran the pluckiest race I ever saw.\\" Grant had lost twelve pounds in weight over the race, and his feet were so blistered he was unable to walk for several days afterward. Grant returned to the Marathon the following year, having taken leave of absence from Harvard and having joined the Cambridgeport Gymnasium Association. He finished in seventh place with a time of 3:08:55. Grant's best result at the Boston Marathon came in 1899. Now running for the Knickerbocker Athletic Club of New York, Grant was once more in the early lead, which he held for about sixteen miles, but the runners had to cope with a significant headwind. Lawrence Bragnolia, a 161-pound blacksmith, was always close behind, and his stocky frame was better suited to coping with the headwind than was Grant's. The two entered into a spirited battle in the Newton Hills, with Bragnolia ultimately prevailing. Grant finished half a mile and three minutes behind Bragnolia, with a time of 2:57:46. Bragnolia's remarks after the race echoed McDermott's two years before; Grant was the pluckiest runner he had ever encountered, and knowing that he would be a bad man to beat, decided to \\"run him out\\" in the first fifteen miles, and was surprised when at the eighteenth mile he was not then sure of victory. Grant's last appearance at the Boston Marathon was in 1900. The race was noted for the entry of a team of five runners from Hamilton, Ontario, including Jack Caffery and Billy Sherring, who led from the start. Grant followed the Hamilton runners closely, leading the local contingent. He worked his way through the Hamilton runners, taking second place and approaching within 100 yards of Jack Caffery, the leader. But turning onto Commonwealth Avenue at about the sixteen-mile mark, Caffery put in a burst of speed that Grant could not match. Grant had overextended himself in his attempt to catch Caffery, and was passed by several runners in the Newton Hills. He finished in eighth place with a time of 3:13:57. Caffery set a course record. Canada did not form an Olympic Committee until 1904, and so when Canadian expatriates Dick Grant and Ronald McDonald entered the Marathon at the 1900 Olympic Games at Paris, along with Arthur Newton, they represented the United States. Only seven out of seventeen entrants finished the race, held on July 19; Newton was fifth, and Grant and McDonald, who ran together for most of the race, filled the last two positions, although reports disagree as to the order of their finishes. The last finisher, whoever that might be, had a time of about 4:24. The race was marred by suggestions of course cutting by the leaders, and McDonald later claimed that only he and Grant actually ran the whole course. The Olympic race was Grant's last marathon, but he continued to race at shorter distances. He left the Harvard Medical School in 1903, and in 1908 accepted a position as track and field coach at the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis. When the First World War broke out in 1914, Grant attempted to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, but was rejected because of his age. In 1916 he accepted an appointment as Director of Athletics at the University of Havana in Cuba. He later became chief of the Department of Athletics in the Cuban Government. Grant married Edith Hutchings in 1909. She was born at St. Mary's, was eighteen years younger than Grant, and was working in Toronto as a stenographer. They had five children born in Minneapolis, Toronto, and Havana. Edith and the children returned to Canada in 1926. Grant returned to Canada from Cuba in 1947 after having lost his sight; he lived for a while with his sister Anna McIlwraith and her family at Aurora, Illinois, but US Immigration deemed him Liable to become a Public Charge (LPC) and denied him Permanent Residence status in that country. He died in 1958 at St. Catherine's, Ontario. Grant had four siblings. An older brother, Rev. William Harvey Grant, served as a missionary at Henan, China for over fifty years. A younger brother, Alexander Grant, was an Olympian runner and US champion in a range of middle-distance and distance events.

As a player, he spent most of his career playing as a forward. Darby has made over 400 senior appearances in English football and scored over 100 goals. He played a significant number of games for Torquay United and Hull City, and also helped both Rushden & Diamonds and Shrewsbury Town gain promotion from the Conference to the Football League. Early career Prior to signing for a professional club, Darby played as a youth for Halas Hawks Junior F.C, a junior football club based at Halesowen in the West Midlands. His manager at that time, Graham Barrett, was instrumental in obtaining his position at Torquay. Darby began his career as an apprentice with Torquay United, making his league debut while still a trainee, scoring in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at home to Reading having come on as a substitute, and he went on to make a further 13 league appearances that season. He turned professional on 3 July 1992 and went on to score 26 times in 108 league games for the Gulls. On 19 July 1995 he moved to Doncaster Rovers, but stayed less than a year, moving to Hull City on 27 March 1996 for a sum of ¬£25,000.Stats and profile at oncloudseven.com He was a great success with the Tigers, scoring regularly and broke the Hull record for most goals in a competitive game when he scored 6 times against Whitby Town in an FA Cup 1st Round Replay in November 1996. After scoring 27 times in 78 league games he moved on a 'Bosman' to newly promoted Notts County on 2 July 1998, but missed most of his first season with the Magpies through injury. He returned to Hull City on loan on 25 March 1999. He started the following season for Notts County in top form, but was surprisingly placed on the transfer list in March 2000 and finally left Notts County on 21 June 2000, joining Conference side Rushden & Diamonds for a fee of ¬£100,000. Promotions from the Conference In his first season at Nene Park, he won the Conference Golden Boot award, his goals helping Rushden win the Conference and with it promotion to the Football League. In November 2000 he was charged with assault after an incident in the players tunnel at the end of the local derby against Kettering Town.Darby pays for derby madness In November 2003, Shrewsbury Town, recently relegated to the Football Conference signed Darby in order to bolster their striking force.Shrews finally bag Darby The signing was well received, with Shrewsbury fans hoping that Darby's experience and proven goalscoring record in the lower leagues would assist them towards promotion, especially when linked with highly regarded striker Luke Rodgers. The strike partnership with Rodgers never quite took off as Darby's time at Shrewsbury was punctuated with injuries, meaning he was unable to get a consistent run in the team. However, Darby's goals in the 2003‚Äì04 season were to prove vital as Shrewsbury made the Conference play-off final. In the final, Darby scored an equalising goal against Aldershot Town at Stoke City's Britannia Stadium. With the game finishing level at 1‚Äì1, Shrewsbury eventually won the final on penalties. Post-Football League With Shrewsbury back in the Football League, Darby struggled to get into the Shrewsbury side. The arrival of new manager Gary Peters did not help Darby's cause, as Peters aimed to rebuild the squad with younger players. Unable to command a regular first team place, Darby was released by Shrewsbury in February 2006Shrewsbury release Lyng and Darby and joined Nuneaton Borough, also becoming Nuneaton's Football in the Community coach.Darby set for Boro debut He scored on his Nuneaton debut, a 2‚Äì2 draw at home to Moor GreenDebut boy Darby salvages a draw and was a regular for Nuneaton, but was released in May 2007.Darby allowed to go On 3 August 2007, Halesowen Town confirmed that Darby had joined the club along with two other former league players, in the shape of Terry Fleming and Stephen Cooke. Triple coup for ambitious Yeltz After a short spell at The Grove, he moved to local rivals Bromsgrove Rovers, taking over as caretaker player-manager just days after arriving at the club after Rod Brown's departure. He could not keep Rovers in the Southern League Premier Division, and was sacked in August 2008 as they were relegated at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. He joined Stourbridge Swifts as a player and finished the 2009‚Äì09 season with Hednesford Town. After a brief spell with Evesham United, he joined Midland Football Alliance club Alvechurch on 19 October 2009, scoring on his debut.

Pantazi, and Ghaki;CƒÉlinescu, p.390, 515 15 March 1831 ‚Äì 17 July 1882) was a Wallachian, later Romanian politician and lawyer, also known as a dramatist, poet, short story writer, and literary critic. A prominent representative of the liberal current, he was the younger brother and lifelong collaborator of Ion Ghica, who served as Prime Minister of the Romanian Kingdom in 1866-1867 and again in 1870-1871. Pantazi Ghica began his political career as a participant in the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, a collaborator of the Romantic historian and activist Nicolae BƒÉlcescu, and a member of the radical grouping headed by C. A. Rosetti. Although twice involved in the administration of BuzƒÉu County, Ghica lived much of his life in exile or in Bucharest, and was also a soldier for the Ottoman Empire during the Crimean War. After 1875, he was a prominent member of the National Liberal Party. Generally seen as a mediocre writer, he was foremost noted for his associations with the literary figures Nicolae Filimon, Vasile Alecsandri, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, Alexandru Odobescu and Alexandru Macedonski, as well as for his extended polemic with the conservative literary society Junimea. Ghica's work and political convictions were criticized and often ridiculed by Junimist intellectuals such as Titu Maiorescu, Mihai Eminescu, and Ion Luca Caragiale. He is most likely one of the unnamed liberal politicians who are negatively portrayed in Eminescu's poem Scrisoarea a III-a. Pantazi Ghica suffered from kyphosis. Notably, this physical defect is mentioned for satirical effect in Eminescu's poem and in Caragiale's autobiographical work, Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur. Biography =Early life and revolutionary activities= Pantazi was born into the Ghica family, a prestigious group of Phanariote hospodars and boyars in the Danubian Principalities, whose origins were Greek and Albanian.Neagu Djuvara, √éntre Orient ≈üi Occident. ≈¢ƒÉrile rom√¢ne la √Ænceputul epocii moderne, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1995, p.90-91. He was the twelfth of fifteen children born to Ban Dimitrie Ghica and his wife Maria C√¢mpineanu (a boyaress of the C√¢mpineanu family).CƒÉlinescu, p.381, 386 Ion, Pantazi, Temistocle and Maria Ghica were the only four children to survive into adulthood.CƒÉlinescu, p.381 Like his siblings, Pantazi Ghica studied at the Saint Sava College in Wallachia's capital.CƒÉlinescu, p.386 It was around that time that he befriended the poet Bolintineanu, who was twelve years his senior and by then already a friend of Ion Ghica.CƒÉlinescu, p.229 His mother later took him to France, where he is known to have been enlisted in a boarding house.CƒÉlinescu, p.387 Upon his return to Wallachia in 1847, together with his brother, Ghica was involved in the agitation leading up to the 1848 uprising, and became BƒÉlcescu's secretary. Andrei Pippidi, \\"AcasƒÉ la Pantazi Ghica\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 164, March 2007 Before the revolution toppled Prince Gheorghe Bibescu and created a new administration, BƒÉlcescu sent Pantazi Ghica as an agitator, in service to the revolutionary organization FrƒÉ≈£ia. Ghica was assigned the task of spreading propaganda in the counties of BuzƒÉu and Prahova. A common Russian-Ottoman intervention quelled the rebellion in autumn of the same year, to reestablish the Regulamentul Organic government. Both Ghica brothers, like most other revolutionaries, were arrested and exiled from Wallachia. =Exile= Ion Ghica (seated) and Vasile Alecsandri, photographed in Istanbul (1855) The younger Ghica again settled in Paris, were his mother Maria was still residing. Following her death, he moved to Istanbul, joining his brother Ion (who was soon after offered protection by Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I). Again in Paris by 1849, he became close friends with a group of Wallachian revolutionaries in exile, including D. Berindey, the physician Iatropolu, Alexandru Zissu and George Cre≈£eanu; the five exiles signed a blood brotherhood pact. Ghica attended high society meetings, and befriended a tenor at the Op√©ra National de Paris. He later claimed to have maintained close contacts with famous Parisian literary figures such as Alexandre Dumas and Alfred de Musset, and to have introduced them to Romanian culture‚Äîthis was to be disputed by his Romanian adversaries, who noted that the account provided inaccurate details.Alexandru Odobescu, Scene istorice. Pseudo-cynegetikos, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1984, p.241-242. Reportedly, he also associated with literary critic Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr, composers Daniel Auber and Fromental Hal√©vy, and playwright Eug√®ne Scribe. He probably studied for a while at the University of Paris' Law Faculty, but it is unclear whether he ever completed his education. His detractors later claimed that Pantazi Ghica had spent more time in the debtors' prison than among students, while Ion Ghica is known to have objected to his brother's lifestyle and to have asked BƒÉlcescu to supervise him. Around 1850, he fell in love with Camila de Fernex, who was related to the family of his French host, Aim√© Guyet de Fernex. They were married in March 1852, when the Catholic Camila obtained a matrimonial dispensation from Marie-Dominique-Auguste Sibour, the Archbishop of Paris. Records of the events show that the matter of his marriage was only settled at the end of a long debate: the Romanian Orthodox Ghica had initially consented to have his children baptized Catholic, and then retracted his statement, leaving Archbishop Sibour to consent after obtaining a less compelling verbal agreement from him. The wedding ceremony took place at a Greek Orthodox church in Marseille. The brothers Ghica returned to Bucharest separately during the late 1850s. Their arrival coincided with the outbreak of the Crimean War: Pantazi Ghica joined the Ottoman Army, serving as a Y√ºzba≈üƒ± in the Cossack Corps (part of the Imperial Guard). Decorated and promoted, he was again present in Bucharest as Russia was defeated and the Treaty of Paris allowed Wallachia to decide a new administration. Ion Ghica, who was promoted Bey of Samos Island in 1854, unsuccessfully applied for the office of Wallachian Prince during 1858, and later rose to ministerial offices.CƒÉlinescu, p.383 =Prosecutor, lawyer and journalist= Members of the Citizens' Guard in Bucharest, 1866 In 1856-1858, he was a prosecutor in D√¢mbovi≈£a County, before starting a private practice as a lawyer on Bucharest's Podul Mogo≈üoaiei. Pantazi Ghica subsequently became one of the main liberal activists, and rallied with its most radical wing, that headed by Rosetti.Vianu, Vol.II, p.85, 347 This came at a time when Wallachia's united with Moldavia under the rule of Alexandru Ioan Cuza (proclaimed in 1859, and effected in 1862). Following Cuza's election in both countries, Ghica joined the civil service: he first replaced his friend George Cre≈£eanu as inspector in the Ministry of Justice (April‚ÄìSeptember 1859) and department head in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (before 1860). He returned to his practice, and, in 1861, was a legal representative for people arrested during the anti-unionist riots in Craiova.CƒÉlinescu, p.391 In 1862, he was appointed attorney for the Ministry of Education. In 1859, Pantazi Ghica joined Dimitrie Bolintineanu in editing the journal D√¢mbovi≈£a, but, just a year later, his articles were the subject of a scandal, and he was arrested for allegedly breaking the ethics of journalism.CƒÉlinescu, p.341, 387, 388 He shared a cell with his colleague, N. T. OrƒÉ≈üanu, a noted adversary of Carol's rule.CƒÉlinescu, p.341 He was also an associate of the writer Alexandru Odobescu, and, after 1861, collaborated on his monthly literary magazine Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ.Vianu, Vol.I, p.99-100 It was here that he published a critical review of Ciocoii vechi ≈üi noi, a novel by his friend Nicolae Filimon, which upset the latter (as a consequence, relations between the two soured). \\"Introductory note to Nicolae Filimon, Ciocoii vechi ≈üi noi, at the Bucharest Municipal Library; retrieved August 19, 2007 For a while during those years, Ghica edited two satirical magazine, PƒÉcalƒÉ (named in honor of the eponymous folk hero) and Scr√¢nciobul.Adamescu, \\"Epoca lui Alecsandri. b\\" In 1863, he went on a trip to Moldavia, where he notably visited his relative Cleopatra Ghica (married into the Russian Trubetskoy family). He was again involved in a trial for calumny, but he was able to prove that the incriminated article was not his. Ghica also took interest in the activities of Iacob Negruzzi, a Moldavian-born writer who arrived in Bucharest around 1865‚Äîit was Ghica who introduced Negruzzi to the Rosetti circle.Vianu, Vol.II, p.85 By the 1870s, he was also contributing articles to Rosetti's journal Rom√¢nul.Ornea, p.293 During the same period, he began publishing his literary pieces in Revista ContimporanƒÉ.Cazimir, p.150 In 1866, Domnitor Cuza was replaced with Carol of Hohenzollern. Apparently, Pantazi Ghica had played a secondary part in the conspiracy that toppled Cuza, as a local commander of the Citizens' Guard.CƒÉlinescu, p.387 Ghica was subsequently assigned the office of BuzƒÉu County prefect by the first of his brother's cabinets. The appointment was welcomed by Vasile Alecsandri, who was keeping a detailed correspondence with both brothers. However, his time in office was cut short, allegedly because he came to be disliked by Carol. He returned to the capital, where he purchased a villa on Cometei Street (the present-day CƒÉderea Bastiliei Street), nearby Pia≈£a RomanƒÉ. For a second time in eight years, he was exposed to public scrutiny for having failed to honor his debts: in 1868, his possessions in BuzƒÉu were sequestrated. Late in the year, he was Alecsandri's representative during a legal conflict with the peasants residing on his domain (after winning the trial, Alecsandri reciprocated by introducing Ghica to his friend, Minister of the Interior Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu).CƒÉlinescu, p.388 =Final years= His new Bucharest residence became a meeting spot for literary figures. Ghica notably associated with the much younger Symbolist poet Alexandru Macedonski, who was also his neighbor.Adamescu, \\"Epoca lui Alecsandri. b\\"; Vianu, Vol.II, p.347 In 1875, Pantazi Ghica was witness to a scandal involving the Romanian Army and Ion Emanuel Florescu, the Minister of War. That year, the officer Ioan Crainic, who considered himself insulted by Florescu, handed in his resignation from the military and challenged the Minister to a duel (asking Ghica to serve as both his courier and witness); the problems were eventually avoided after Florescu ordered his subordinates to arrest Crainic. At the time, Macedonski engaged in liberal politics, and, in 1876, co-founded the short-lived newspaper Stindardul, alongside Ghica, Bonifaciu Florescu, and George FƒÉlcoianu.Vianu, Vol.II, p.347 The publication was inspired by the renowned journalist Nicolae Moret Blaremberg. Later, Ghica also published essays in Macedonski's newly founded and more prestigious magazine, Literatorul.Adamescu, \\"Epoca lui Alecsandri. b\\"; Ornea, p.301-302 He was for long a member of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, representing the \\"Red\\" liberal tendency and, late in life, the National Liberals. In June 1876, shortly after the first concentrated National Liberal cabinet came to power, he and Nicolae Fleva spearheaded the effort to prosecute the former \\"White\\" Conservative ministers. In opening the case, Ghica stated: \\"It wasn't just us who condemned those ministers, but public opinion in general, the entire country, cast a blame on them, and we are the expression of that blame\\".Bulei, p.26 The effort pitted Pantazi Ghica against his main literary rival, outgoing Education Minister Titu Maiorescu, who was called in for questioning.Bulei, p.29 The attempt to stage a trial was ultimately defeated by moderates in Ghica's own party, who ignored his vocal protests.Bulei, p.30 In June 1881, promoting the designs of one Traian Theodorescu, Pantazi Ghica unsuccessfully presented Parliament with a proposal to have a submarine built for the Romanian Navy.Florin Manolescu, Literatura S.F., Editura Univers, Bucharest, 1980, p.47. During the same year, he was a cabinet-appointed inspector of historical monuments in Moldavia. In spring of 1882, shortly before his death, Ghica, like many of his fellow National Liberals, spoke out against I. Filibiliu, a teacher at the Matei Basarab High School who had administered a mild form of corporal punishment to one of his pupils.Perpessicius, p.242-244 Pantazi Ghica died at his house on Cometei Street, and was buried at his family's estate in Ghergani. Camila Ghica survived him by 21 years: reportedly afflicted by dementia in old age, she died in 1908, at the age of 80. In culture =Works= Wallachian Romantic aesthetics in an illustration to Nemesis, one of Dimitrie Bolintineanu's poems Ghica published the first of his many Romantic novellas by the 1860s, when he collaborated on Odobescu's magazine. Literary critic Tudor Vianu noted that some of his works had a strong connection with Bohemianism,Vianu, Vol.II, p.237 while others are thought to be influenced by the Romantic author Dimitrie Bolintineanu.CƒÉlinescu, p.389, 390 With time, however, Ghica moved away from Romanticism, and developed his own brand of Realism, which did not exclude imagination and speculation, and which hailed Alecsandri as a prime example of writing. He was also opposed to Macedonski's notion of \\"sublime absurdity\\", arguing that the definitive criterion for creating poetic imagery was significance, and proposing elements of didacticism to feature in every work.CƒÉlinescu, p.388, 391 In one instance, he argued that beauty \\"must absolutely be united with the good\\". Ghica's work of hidden memoirs, the novella Un boem rom√¢n (\\"A Romanian Bohemian\\"), was a tale of adventure and unrequited love: its main character, Paul, whose adventures mirror many in Ghica's life, elopes with a married woman, only to find that she is not faithful to him either. The plot is probably the first one in Romanian literature to discuss the topic of free love. \\"Lecturi la zi. ≈ûapte teme\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 8/2003 In 1850, Ghica authored a piece in honor of the deceased poet Vasile C√¢rlova, titled O lacrimƒÉ a poetului C√¢rlova (\\"One of Poet C√¢rlova's Tears\\"). It depicted C√¢rlova drinking from a skull-shaped cup with the inscription Lina, adu-≈£i aminte! (\\"Lina, remember!\\", allegedly in honor of a nun he had loved).CƒÉlinescu, p.389 In addition, Pantazi Ghica wrote a lengthy satire the high society in his day (Schi≈£e din societatea rom√¢nƒÉ, \\"Sketches of the Romanian Society\\"), and, as a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, the play RƒÉni≈£ii rom√¢ni (\\"The Wounded Romanians\\").CƒÉlinescu, p.390, 391 Ghica was outraged to find that the National Theater did not accept his play, and, as a consequence, issued a formal protest. He contributed several romantic comedies, including, among others, Iade≈ü (\\"Wishbone\\") and Sterian PƒÉ≈£itul (roughly, \\"Sterian Who Has Learned\\"). He is also the most likely author of a piece sometimes attributed to his brother, in which the author explores the literary legacy of Don Juan.CƒÉlinescu, p.390 =Be≈£ia de cuvinte= By the close of the 1860s, Pantazi Ghica was among the main targets of early criticism from Junimea‚Äîa literary society which expressed a conservative vision and was opposed to the cultural and political tenets of liberalism. Ghica's works were among those discussed by Junimeas Titu Maiorescu in his famous essay of 1873, Be≈£ia de cuvinte. The title, meaning literally \\"inebriation with words\\", attacked Romantic liberals over their experiments with Romanian language, their Romantic nationalist aesthetic guidelines, and their emphatic prose. The influential Maiorescu saw these as a main source for the widespread cultural and social problems facing Romania during its process of Westernization.Ornea, p.291-292 Thus, Revista ContimporanƒÉ contributors such as Ghica, V. A. Urechia, August Treboniu Laurian, and Gheorghe Sion are listed by Maiorescu as negative examples in Romanian literature, for their use of coined neologisms, as well as for their tautologies and contradictions. Titu Maiorescu, Be≈£ia de cuvinte √Æn \\"Revista ContimporanƒÉ\\" (wikisource)Ornea, p.292 Maiorescu sarcastically recorded that Ghica was introducing new words to the Romanian lexis, through the means of Francization. Among other samples, the author used as illustrations several fragments from Pantazi Ghica's novella Marele vistier C√¢ndescu (\\"The Great Treasurer C√¢ndescu\\"). He noted the implicit tautology in Ghica's term silen≈£iu lugubru (\\"lugubrious silence\\"), pointing out that the first word covered the meaning of \\"silent\\" (thus leaving the notion to be read \\"silent silence\\"). A more complex one, listing several synonyms on end, read: > \\"[...] all left in silence but their faces showed the same pain, the same > exasperation, the same desperation.\\" Pantazi Ghica, Urechia, Dimitrie August Laurian and Petru GrƒÉdi≈üteanu decided to issue a common reply to Maiorescu's accusations, using Rom√¢nul as their venue. The Junimist intellectual believed that their answer was an ignoratio elenchi, and dismissed their defense as \\"beside the point\\" (nu e la chestie). Titu Maiorescu, RƒÉspunsurile \\"Revistei Contimporane\\" (wikisource) On the occasion, he also presented Ghica with more of his own mistakes. Although not a Junimist, Odobescu himself agreed with such views, and pointed out further inexactitudes in the works of Pantazi Ghica‚Äîthese comments are featured in a chapter of his major book, the Pseudo-cynegetikos, in its revised edition of 1887.Vianu, Vol.II, p.249 Odobescu recorded the polemic between Ghica and the contributors to Junimea's magazine Convorbiri Literare‚Äîthe former stood accused of having embellished his own biography by claiming to have won the interest of French writers during his stay in Paris. Odobescu hinted that he agreed with this assessment, stressing that Alexandre Dumas and Alfred de Musset had since died, and thus could not confirm that Pantazi Ghica had befriended them. He also noted, like the Junimists, that the chronological order indicated by Ghica was spurious. The latter argument referred to Ghica's statement that, in 1852, Dumas and de Musset had listened to his rendition of Vasile Alecsandri's poem √én≈üirƒÉ-te MƒÉrgƒÉrite, which had in fact been completed in 1856, and first made available for the public four years later. Ghica was unnerved by Maiorescu's reaction to his work, and verbally attacked the younger literary critic in several contexts spanning his career. This was the case in 1878, when both of them stood in the Chamber for opposite camps, and when Ghica heckled Maiorescu, who was giving a speech. On one occasion, Pantazi Ghica depicted Maiorescu as \\"a sort of a literary trickster\\", and himself claimed that his adversary was \\"at odds with grammar\\". Elsewhere, he claimed that Maiorescu's style \\"entirely lacks the conditions of serious criticism\\". With time, the conflict between Ghica and Convorbiri Literare degenerated into open hostility. Thus, in an unsigned piece of 1875, the magazine claimed to translate Victor Hugo's Chansons des rues et des bois: instead of the hunchback Mayeux, whom Hugo had placed at the end of a cortege grouping all animals, the Convorbiri Literare version had introduced \\"Pantazi\\" and adapted the rhyme accordingly. Maiorescu's verdicts on Pantazi Ghica were shared by more modern Romanian critics. Tudor Vianu called Ghica \\"prolific, but not gifted\\".Vianu, Vol.I, p.100 Elsewhere, he backed Ghica's inclusion among the \\"victims of Inebriation with words [italics in the original]\\", as well as Maiorescu's criticism of his Francized speech. Vianu's generation colleague George CƒÉlinescu defined Pantazi Ghica as \\"untalented\\" (although he acknowledged his \\"vast literary culture\\"), while ≈ûtefan Cazimir likened his writings for the stage to what he believed was Ion Luca Caragiale's worst play, the melodrama O soacrƒÉ. CƒÉlinescu referred to Marele vistier C√¢ndescu as featuring \\"annoying neologisms\\" and \\"the lack of any intuition, no matter how modest, for historical color.\\" Two exceptions among commentators were Gheorghe Adamescu, who valued several of Ghica's works (including his 1850 piece about Vasile C√¢rlova),Adamescu, \\"Epoca lui Alecsandri. a\\" and ≈ûtefan Sihleanu, who credited Ghica with having single-handedly introduced Alessandro Manzoni's type of historical novels to local literature, in their adapted novella form. =Ghica's politics and the Junimists= The conservative groupings were especially critical of Pantazi Ghica's politics. Iacob Negruzzi, who eventually rallied with the Junimists, resented Rosetti's radical circle, and left an unflattering memoir of its meetings. Several other writers who associated with Junimea attacked the two brothers Ghica for their alleged corruption and demagogy. In Mihai Eminescu's lengthy poem Scrisoarea a III-a, an entire section elaborates a virulent anti-liberal discourse. Of it, a group of lyrics are believed to refer to Pantazi Ghica (identified by his appearance and his kyphosis) or, alternatively, to a composite portrayal of the two brothers.Ornea, p.197-198 They read: Eminescu followed Ghica's political career with interest. In one of his articles for the Conservative journal Timpul, published in early 1882, he examined the Filibiliu affair, he took the teacher's side, arguing that both Ghica and Filibiliu's other National Liberal detractor, Petru GrƒÉdi≈üteanu, were exaggerating.Perpessicius, p.243 He commented that the scandal was largely owed to the victim's father having made use of his political connections with the Ion BrƒÉtianu cabinet, and protested when the teacher assigned a provincial post as a punitive measure.Perpessicius, p.242-248 This was one of several polemics between Eminescu and various associates of Rosetti: literary historian Perpessicius argued that they were partly responsible for the \\"super-tensed\\" relations between Rom√¢nul and Timpul.Perpessicius, p.246-247 George CƒÉlinescu identified other, less-known, poems by Eminescu, which also allude to Ghica's style, politics and personal life. The dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, who wrote many of his works under the influence of Junimist principles, developed his own thesis on the political shortcomings of the liberal trend. As part of it, he argued that there was an essential difference between, on one hand, the major liberal figures of the 1848 revolution (Nicolae BƒÉlcescu, Ion C√¢mpineanu and Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu) and, on the other, members of the National Liberal Party such as Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail PƒÉt√¢rlƒÉgeanu.Ornea, p.203 In his view, the latter group usurped the revolutionary legacy, while the former could have found itself best represented by the emerging Conservative Party. =Anecdotes= A socialite, Ghica was famed for his hectic lifestyle and his eclectic culture, which earned him the moniker Fantazaki (a pun on his two names, it originated in fantezie, the Romanian word for \\"fantasy\\") and the colloquial title of \\"king of the Romanian Bohemia\\". Among his recorded eccentricities were the contrast in his attitudes toward dogs and cats (a lover of the former, he despised the latter), and his refusal to travel anywhere except by coach. A rumor which probably made it into Eminescu's poetry had it that Pantazi Ghica, the alleged lover of famed and usually foreign actresses, sold tickets to their shows in front of coffee houses.CƒÉlinescu, p.387, 388 Nonetheless, others knew him as a gentleman, praising him for his kindness and sociability.CƒÉlinescu, p.387-388 At some stage in their lives, Pantazi Ghica and his friend C. A. Rosetti briefly associated with a circle of actors meeting in the house of theater manager Iorgu Caragiale (Ion Luca's uncle). Ion Luca Caragiale, Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur (wikisource) Ion Luca Caragiale's 1907 work, Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur, featured an anecdote about Pantazi Ghica and Iorgu Caragiale, recounting how the former had fallen in love with an unnamed actress. According to the story, Ghica, who had asked the group of actors to facilitate an amorous meeting with the object of his affection, was the target of a prank: Iorgu Caragiale reportedly arranged for his colleague, a certain Matache Pi≈£irigƒÉ, to dress up in female clothes and meet Ghica in an unlit room. The story went that the Pantazi Ghica caressed Pi≈£irigƒÉ, causing the latter to become indignant and thus reveal his true identity. According to Ion Luca Caragiale, a shocked Pantazi Ghica ran out of the room and into the Fialcowsky coffee house. The amused reaction of the public surprised him, and he subsequently found that, in the dark, Pi≈£irigƒÉ had smeared his face with soot.CƒÉlinescu, p.267, 387 In its initial unpublished version, Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur simply described Iorgu Caragiale's victim as \\"a hunchback\\". Caragiale later added to his own text: > \\"...When, a couple of years back, I was adding the lines above to my > notebook, the cheated young man was still alive; today he is dead‚Äîmay God > forgive all the lyrics and all the prose with which he has enriched our > young literature, all the speeches he has held in succession in front of the > two Chambers and during public meetings!‚Äîand since ¬´one should only speak > well of the dead¬ª, here is name pure and simple: Pantazi Ghica.\\" Another anecdote of the time had it that Pantazi Ghica was deeply resented by Domnitor Carol. According to the story, this was sparked by one of Carol's hunting trips in the vicinity of BuzƒÉu. Ghica, who was charged with organizing the event, allegedly thought he could gain more favor with the monarch by using a bear which, unbeknown to Carol, had been previously tamed by Romani trainers (see Ursari). Carol found out that this was the case, and, feeling insulted, ordered Pantazi Ghica to be relieved from his office of prefect. The short-lived magazine Satyrul once accused Ghica of having plagiarized for his Iade≈ü, and of having only added a dog as a character to separate his text from the source. As a result, a series of satirical lithographs, with Pantazi Ghica as their subject, showed a hunchback man in the company of a hunchback dog. Jokes about his medical condition even made it into the Chamber: a fellow deputy once made a public reference to Pantazi Ghica's arched spine, to which Ghica replied that it seemed arched because he only presented such colleagues with his back. In 2010, researcher Radu CernƒÉtescu proposed that Pantazi Ghica is the inspiration behind Gore Pirgu, the prototype social climber depicted in Craii de Curtea-Veche novel. Cosmin Ciotlo≈ü, \\"Cum grano salis\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 44/2010 The work, a Romanian classic, was written in the 1920s by Caragiale's estranged son Mateiu, and, CernƒÉtescu notes, shows Ghica in company with decadent aristocrats from the Cantacuzino and Soutzos clans.

Lead up to Battle Toward the end of the Kongo Civil War, the religious leader Dona Beatriz had successfully started a movement to reoccupy the abandoned capital of S√£o Salvador and attempt to bring an end to the bloodshed between the ruling kandas of Kongo. During her resettlement of Kongo, she had attracted the support of Pedro Constantino da Silva also known as Kibenga. Seeking to exploit the movement, Kibenga lent his support to it while at the same time undermining King Pedro IV. King Pedro IV had been working toward restoring Kongo after decades of civil war, even going so far as to name Kibenga Prince of Kongo. Kibenga, who had switched allegiance on more than one occasion, betrayed King Pedro and threw his military support behind the Antonians. When Dona Beatriz was captured and executed by Pedro IV, Kibenga was left in charge of a religious movement he didn't really believe in. King Pedro IV had issued a pardon to all partisans (Kinlaza and Kimpanzu alike) in hopes of forestalling further bloodshed. When this as well as Pedro's Capuchin allies were unable to rein in Kibenga, Pedro IV led a sort of holy war to retake the capital and stamp out the Antonians once and for all. The Battle and Aftermath Brandishing only a cross and going with the support of the church, Pedro IV marched on S√£o Salvador with an army of 20,000 men against Kibenga and his Antonians. In the engagement that followed, the Antonians were utterly routed. Kibenga tried to appeal to the pardon, but was killed and decapitated in the chaos of battle. At long last, Pedro IV was back in the capital for good. The battle marked the end of the period where rival claimants ruled in name only from fortified positions throughout the kingdom. King Pedro IV continued his policy of peaceful resolution engaging in only one more major battle before his death in 1718.

Many of Level's stories have been translated into American newspapers since 1903, notably his well-known tale \\"The Debt-Collector\\" (at least eight different translations). Between 1917 and 1919 the literary editor of the New York Tribune, William L. McPherson (1865-1930), translated seventeen war tales (three of them anonymously), seven of them being collected in Tales of Wartime France (1918). In 1920, English journalist, editor and publisher Alys Eyre Macklin (ca. 1875-1929) arranged a treaty with Level to be his official literary agent for all English-language countries .Jean-Luc Buard, \\"Alys Eyre Macklin, Maurice Level's English Friend and Translator\\", afterword to Crises, vol. 1, Tales of Mystery and Horror, Mad Sheep, 2017., and translated a selection of 26 tales as Crises, Tales of Mystery and Horror (1920). Nine of them have been first published by Hearst's Magazine in New York in 1919-1920. Some other tales appeared later in various newspapers or magazines in England or in the USA, such as Pan (London), or in the well-known pulp magazine Weird Tales.Stefan R. Dziemianowicz, \\"Introduction\\", to 100 Wild Little Weird Tales,edited by Robert Weinberg, Dziemianowicz and Martin H. Greenberg, Barnes and Noble, 1994 (pp. xvii-xix). . H. P. Lovecraft observed of Level's fiction in his essay Supernatural Horror in Literature (1927): \\"This type, however, is less a part of the weird tradition than a class peculiar to itself ‚Äî the so-called conte cruel, in which the wrenching of the emotions is accomplished through dramatic tantalizations, frustrations and gruesome physical horrors\\". Critic Philippe Gontier wrote: \\"We can only admire, now almost one hundred years later, the great artistry with which Maurice Level fabricated his plots, with what care he fashioned all the details of their unfolding and how with a master's hand he managed the building of suspense\\". Thanks to Lovecraft, Maurice Level has been recognized in the United State and also in Japan as a little master of the horrible, when he was forgotten in his own country, France during the major part of the XXth century. He was still in print in both these countries in the years 2000. Since 2017, various new editions of his works have been reissued in France, with new critical material.

Plot Whilst Tom is sleeping, Jerry and Nibbles, standing on a chimney top, decide to play mean tricks on Tom. Nibbles uses a fishing line to lower Jerry to the bottom of the chimney. Jerry hits Tom with a fly swatter, leaving it in Tom's hand, and Nibbles quickly reels him in, making Tom believe that he hit himself in his sleep. Tom goes back to sleep without thinking of it anymore. Later, Jerry is lowered down the chimney holding a revolver. Jerry places the gun in Tom's hand while he's asleep and has a string tied to its trigger. As Jerry is reeled up, he pulls the string to the gun's trigger, firing the gun and waking Tom up, who is surprised to think he shot at himself in his sleep. Panicking at this, he attempts to get rid of the gun, setting it off and creating a long scar on his head. Unable to figure it out, he just goes back to sleep. But as he does, the mice pull off their next trick. They drill a hole through the ceiling and lower a noose on Tom. Tom wakes up and looks around, getting the noose around his neck. Just as he goes back to sleep, the mice lower the other end of the rope onto Tom's hand, which he takes notice. He peers at the rope on the chandelier and then he tugs it slightly twice and it slightly pulls his neck. He quickly panics as he gets the noose off of his head, but after he gets it off, the chandelier unexpectedly unscrews itself from the ceiling and it falls right on top of Tom's head. Tom then gives a quick laugh before he faints and falls flat on his back. The two mice prepare their next trick. As Tom is going back to sleep, the mice place a knife in his hands. Then Jerry opens a bottle of ketchup and pours some onto the end of the knife and then some onto Tom's chest. When Tom wakes up, he sees the stained knife in his hand and thinks that the knife is covered in blood, so he panics and leans against the wall. Then he clenches his chest and sees ketchup on his hand. Thinking that it's blood, he quickly concludes that he had stabbed himself in his sleep. Tom rushes into the bathroom and grabs a tourniquet, which he uses to tighten his neck. When he does, he inflates himself like a balloon and floats up onto the ceiling. As he does, he floats out of the bathroom and back in the living room where he notices the bottle of ketchup on the table. Then he tastes the ketchup on his chest and realizes it's a trick and starts laughing, but as he does, the tourniquet loosens and he starts to deflate, flying around the room until he lands on his pillow. As Jerry makes fun of Tom's predicament, Nibbles notices a bow and arrow on the ground. This time, they set Tom inside the bow as he is asleep. After Jerry signals Nibbles to pull him back up, Tom stretches, which stretches the bow and causes it to launch him through the hallway, crashing through a vent in the wall, down a pipe, into the furnace, getting Tom launched through another pipe and then out the stovepipe chimney on the roof. The two mice watch Tom as he flies in the air and down the chimney they are standing on. Then they look down the chimney to see the aftermath of their latest prank. However, Tom sees the two mice and angrily points the gun straight at them, meaning that he has had enough of their tricks. Later, Jerry and Nibbles are trapped in a bottle with the revolver facing them. If they remove the cork to get out, it will pull a string which the other end is tied to the trigger of the gun, and they would be killed or injured by the gunshot. Jerry and Nibbles can only sit there and sulk angrily at their predicament while Tom, basking in unexpected victory, takes his peace and quiet nap, using his tail to cool himself off with a fan.

(1960), ‚ÄúA Comparison of the Meaning and Uses of Models in Mathematics and the Empirical Sciences,‚Äù Synthese 12: 287‚Äì301. as a reaction against the received view of theories popular among the logical positivists. Many varieties of the semantic view propose identifying theories with a class of set-theoretic models in the Tarskian sense,Suppes, P. (1960) and da Costa, Newton C. A., and Steven French (1990), ‚ÄúThe Model-Theoretic Approach in the Philosophy of Science‚Äù, Philosophy of Science 57: 248‚Äì265. while others specify models in the mathematical language stipulated by the field of which the theory is a member.van Fraassen, Bas C. (1980), The Scientific Image. Oxford: Clarendon. and Suppe, Frederick (1989), The Semantic Conception of Theories and Scientific Realism. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. Semantic vs. syntactic views of theories The semantic view is typically contrasted with the syntactic view of theories of the logical positivists and logical empiricists, especially Carl Gustav Hempel and Rudolf Carnap. On the contrast between syntactic and semantic views, Bas van Fraassen writes: > The syntactic picture of a theory identifies it with a body of theorems, > stated in one particular language chosen for the expression of that theory. > This should be contrasted with the alternative of presenting a theory in the > first instance by identifying a class of structures as its models. In this > second, semantic, approach the language used to express the theory is > neither basic nor unique; the same class of structures could well be > described in radically different ways, each with its own limitations. The > models occupy central stage.van Fraassen B. 1980. The Scientific Image. > Oxford University Press, p. 44. In this same book, van Fraassen, a key founder of the semantic view of theories, critiques the syntactic view in very strong terms: > Perhaps the worst consequence of the syntactic approach was the way it > focused attention on philosophically irrelevant technical questions. It is > hard not to conclude that those discussions of axiomatizability in > restricted vocabularies, 'theoretical terms', Craig‚Äôs theorem, 'reduction > sentences', 'empirical languages', Ramsey and Carnap sentences, were one and > all off the mark‚Äîsolutions to purely self-generated problems, and > philosophically irrelevant. (p. 56) The semantic view of theories has been extended to other domains, including population genetics.Lloyd, EA. 1994. The Structure and Confirmation of Evolutionary Theory.

(1653) was the first to observe and describe a free-living nematode, which he dubbed the \\"vinegar eel;\\" and Tyson (1683) used a crude microscope to describe the rough anatomy of the human intestinal roundworm, Ascaris lumbricoides. Other well-known microscopists spent time observing and describing free-living and animal- parasitic nematodes: HookeHooke, R. (1667). Micrographia: etc. London. (1683), LeeuwenhoekLeeuwenhoek, A.

Nouvelles recherches sur les decouvertes microscopiques, etc. Londres & Paris. (1769) are among these. Observations and descriptions of plant parasitic nematodes, which were less conspicuous to ancient scientists, didn't receive as much or as early attention as did animal parasites. The earliest allusion to a plant parasitic nematode is, however, preserved in famous writ. \\"Sowed cockle, reap'd no corn,\\" a line by William Shakespeare penned in 1594 in Love's Labour's Lost, Act IV, Scene 3, most certainly has reference to blighted wheat caused by the plant parasite, Anguina tritici.Thorne, G. (1961). \\"Introduction\\", pp. 1‚Äì21 in Principles of Nematology. McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., New York. Needham (1743) solved the \\"riddle of cockle\\" when he crushed one of the diseased wheat grains and observed \\"Aquatic Animals...denominated Worms, Eels, or Serpents, which they very much resemble.\\" It is likely that few or no other recorded observations of plant parasitic nematodes or their effects are to be found in ancient literature.Steiner, G. (1960). \\"Nematology-An Outlook\\", pp. 3‚Äì7 in Nematology: Fundamentals and Recent Advances. J. N. Sasser and W. R. Jenkins, eds. The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill. From 1750 to the early 1900s, nematology research continued to be descriptive and taxonomic, focusing primarily on free-living nematodes and plant and animal parasites.Van Gundy, S. D. (1987). \\"Perspectives on Nematology Research\\", pp. 28‚Äì31 in Vistas on Nematology. J. A. Veech and D. W. Dickson, eds. Society of Nematologists, Inc. Hyattsville, Maryland. During this period a number of productive researchers contributed to the field of nematology in the United States and abroad. Beginning with Needham and continuing to Cobb, nematologists compiled and continuously revised a broad descriptive morphological taxonomy of nematodes.  History: 1850 to the present  KuhnKuhn, J. (1874). \\"Ubers das Vorkommen von Ruben-Nematoden an den Wurzeln der Halmfruchte\\". Landwirts. Jahrb. 3:47‚Äì50. (1874) is thought to be the first to use soil fumigation to control nematodes, applying carbon disulfide treatments in sugar beet fields in Germany. In Europe from 1870 to 1910, nematological research focused heavily on controlling the sugar beet nematode as sugar beet production became an important economy during this time in the Old World. Although 18th and 19th century scientists yielded a considerable amount of important fundamental and applied knowledge about nematode biology, nematology research really began to advance in quality and quantity near the turn of the 20th century. In 1918, the first permanent nematology field station was constructed in the U.S. Post Office in Salt Lake City, Utah under the direction of Harry B. Shaw, after scientists observed the sugar beet nematode in a field south of the city. In this same year, Nathan Cobb (1918) published his Contributions to a Science of Nematology and his lab manual \\"Estimating the Nema Population of Soil.\\"Cobb, N. A. (1918). \\"Estimating the nema population of soil\\". U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bur. Plant. Indrusty, Agr. Tech. Cir. 1:1‚Äì48. These two publications provide definitive resources for many methods and apparatus used in nematology even to this day. Of Cobb's far-reaching influence on nematology research, Jenkins and TaylorJenkins, W. R., and Taylor, D. P. (1967). \\"Introduction\\", p. 7 in Plant Nematology. Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York. write: :Although many workers have played important roles in development of plant nematology, none have had a greater impact, particularly in the United States, than N.A. Cobb. In 1913 Cobb published his first paper on nematology in the United States. From [1913] to 1932 he was the undisputed leader in [nematology] in this country. Through his efforts the widely renowned [USDA] nematology research program was initiated and developed. Many of his students and colleagues developed into the leaders in plant nematology in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. In addition, during his productive career he contributed major discoveries in the areas of nematode taxonomy, morphology, and in methodology. Many of his techniques are still unsurpassed! Perhaps no one person has had as favorable an impact on the field of nematology as has Nathan Augustus Cobb. From 1900‚Äì1925 various state-run agricultural experimental stations investigated important problems relating to agro- economy, though few stations devoted much attention to plant-parasitic nematodes. Accounts of the history of nematology (the few that exist) mention three major events occurring between 1926 and 1950 that affected the relative importance of nematodes in the eyes of farmers, legislators and the U.S. public in general. These same events had profound worldwide effects on the course of nematology research over the next fifty to seventy-five years First, the discovery of the golden nematode in the potato fields of Long Island led to a trip by U.S. quarantine officials to the potato fields of Europe, where the devastating effects of this parasite had been known for many years. This excursion allayed all skepticism about the seriousness of this agricultural pest. Second, the introduction of the soil fumigants, D-D and EDB made available for the first time nematicides that could be used effectively and practically on a field scale. Third, the development of nematode-resistant crop cultivars brought substantial government funding to applied nematology research.Christie, J. R. (1960). \\"The Role of the Nematologist\\", pp. 8‚Äì11 in Nematology: Fundamentals and Recent Advances. J. N. Sasser and W. R. Jenkins, eds. The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill. These events contributed to a shift from broad taxonomy-based nematology research to deep, yet focused investigations of plant parasitic nematodes, especially the control of agricultural pests. From the early 1930s until recently, the bulk of researchers studying nematodes have been plant pathologists by training. Consequently, nematological research leaned heavily toward answering plant pathological and agro-economical questions for the last three-quarters of the 20th century.

The division was formed on the mobilization of the German Army in August 1914.33. Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) The division was disbanded in August 1918. The division began the war as part of the central reserve of Fortress Metz (Hauptreserve/Festung Metz). Although designated a reserve division, it was initially composed of one active and one reserve infantry brigade. The active brigade was the 8th Bavarian Infantry Brigade, which had been detached from the 4th Bavarian Infantry Division. The rest of the division's troops came primarily from the Prussian Rhine Province and the Province of Westphalia. Combat chronicle The 33rd Reserve Division began the war on the Western Front, where it fought in the Battle of the Frontiers and advanced to the Verdun region. From September 1914 to August 1916, it occupied the line in the region between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers. In late 1916, it suffered heavy losses in the later phases of the 1916 Battle of Verdun. After a few months in the trenches in Lorraine, it went to the Chemin des Dames region and fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also known as the Third Battle of Champagne (and to the Germans as the Double Battle on the Aisne and in the Champagne), and again suffered heavy losses. In September 1917, the division was transferred to the Eastern Front, arriving shortly before the December armistice on that front. It returned to the Western Front in January 1918, where it fought in several engagements, including the Aisne and the Champagne-Marne offensives against French and American forces, after which it was disbanded and its troops distributed to other divisions. Allied intelligence rated it as a good division in 1917, but before its dissolution in 1918, it was rated as fourth class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 405-408.

The Naim-Andonian Documents on the World War I Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians: The Anatomy of a Genocide. International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 18, No.3, August 1986, p. 550 Scottish historian Niall Ferguson, professor of history at Harvard University, senior research fellow of Jesus College, University of Oxford, and senior fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and Richard Albrecht among others also point to the fact that the court did not question the authenticity of the telegrams in 1921‚Äìwhich, however, were not introduced as evidence in court‚Äìand that the British had also intercepted numerous telegrams which directly \\"incriminated exchanges between Talaat and other Turkish officials\\", and that \\"one of the leading scientific experts, Vahakn N. Dadrian, in 1986, verified the documents as authentic telegrams send out by [...] Talat Pasha\\". He adds: Turkish historian Taner Ak√ßam mentions similarities between the telegrams published by Andonian to extant Ottoman documents. In a book published in 2016, named ‚ÄúThe Naim Efendi Memoirs and Talat Pasha Telegrams‚Äù, he states that the memoir and the telegrams are real. Ak√ßam states that throughout his research he has discovered some serious new information and documents supporting his claim. Ak√ßam summarizes them as following: * There was, in fact, an Ottoman officer named Naim Efendi. The original Ottoman documents that prove this exist, and some of them are published in Ak√ßam's book. * There is a memoir that belongs to Naim Efendi. The microfiche copies of it, which he wrote in Ottoman in his own handwriting, are currently in Ak√ßam‚Äôs possession. In his book he presents these pages as they are. * The memoir is genuine and the information it provides is correct. It is possible to find documents in the Ottoman archives referring to the same events and people as the memoir does. * Turkish historians ≈ûinasi Orel and S√ºreyya Yuca stated that the use of lined paper in a telegram indicates that the document is a fake, because, according to them, the Ottoman bureaucracy did not use lined paper. Ak√ßam presents evidence that during this particular time period the Ottoman bureaucracy did use lined paper and there are many documents in the Ottoman archives that show that the Internal Ministry‚Äôs numerous agencies were ordering lined paper. * The telegrams that Naim Efendi sold to Andonian consist of two and three-digit codes. Orel and Yuca claim that during the war years the Ottoman government only used coding techniques that consisted of four and five-digit codes. Thus, they said, the telegrams were fake. Ak√ßam presents evidence that during the war years the Ottoman government used numerical codes consisting of various different digit groupings to send orders via telegram. The texts he has discovered in the Ottoman archives used a series of two, three, four, and five-digit codes.

MacDonald wrote that Lewy is content to rely on the work of \\"Turkish deniers ≈ûinasi Orel and Sureyya Yuca\\": \\"Lewy's conception of shaky pillars echoes the work of Holocaust deniers, who also see Holocaust history resting on pillars... This is a dangerous proposition, because it assumes from the start that genocide scholarship rests on lies which can easily be disproved once a deeper examination of the historical 'truth' is undertaken\\". Other opinions include Dutch professor Erik-Jan Z√ºrcher (professor of Turkish studies at Leiden University) ; Z√ºrcher does however point to many other corroborating documents supporting the Andonian Telegrams assertion of core involvement and premeditation of the killing by the central CUP members.

The station was between Featherston and Cross Creek stations on the Wairarapa Line. The station was bypassed when the Rimutaka Tunnel was opened.  History  During work on the Incline Contract for the Rimutaka Incline, land was taken just north-east of Lucena's Creek (known today as Owhanga Stream) for a road diversion around what was to become the yard for a station identified on plans as Lucena's. By the time the station was opened in 1878, its name had been changed to Pigeon Bush. It had a passenger platform and shelter shed, loading bank, portable sheep loading ramp, a loop siding and a crossing loop. The chief traffic through this station was sheep, but its main purpose was to provide a crossing point for trains. H class Fell locomotives were used occasionally to bank trains from Pigeon Bush to Cross Creek until about 1943. The station was fully signalled in 1922. As a result of the derailing of a mixed train that had just departed Pigeon Bush for Featherston on 19 January 1888 due to severe wind gusts, windbreak fences and rows of willow trees were erected along the length of line most prone to the wind. However, on 8 October 1936, the Wairarapa railcar Mamari was overturned by a strong wind gust just north of the Pigeon Bush windbreak, coming to rest on its side. There were no fatalities, but several of the passengers required hospital treatment in Featherston. This incident led to the extension of the windbreak fence during the following three months. The station was closed on 30 October 1955 when the old line over the Rimutaka Ranges was closed while the Rimutaka Deviation was prepared for being opened to traffic. Once the old line and station facilities had been removed, the road reverted to its original course.  Today  There are no obvious signs of the station remaining today, save for the road deviation which is still visible and now provides access to a neighbouring farm. The railway house that was on site and outlasted the station by several decades has been removed. The piles of the rail bridge south of the station that once crossed the Owhango Stream are still in situ.  Future  The Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust aims to restore the original line over the Rimutaka Ranges from Maymorn. At this stage, they have made no firm plans regarding a line between Cross Creek and Featherston.

Biography Morgan was born in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, received his M.S. in Mechanics and Hydraulics 1951 from the University of Iowa, and a doctorate in Naval Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1961, and devoted his entire professional career to the Carderock Division (David Taylor Model Basin), Naval Surface Warfare Center, Bethesda, Maryland. Morgan started working with UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II computers in 1954. He introduced computers into naval engineering and thereby revolutionized propeller design. He published numerous studies of sub- cavitating, super-cavitating, and contra-rotating propellers; annular airfoil and ducted propeller theory; propeller blade strength; hydrodynamic properties of blade sections; and propeller cavitation, ventilation and noise. Perhaps most significantly, he led development of the highly skewed propeller with its superior vibration and acoustic properties. Morgan ultimately was named head of the hydromechanics directorate, David Taylor Model Basin, responsible for all hydromechanic research concerning U.S. Navy ships and submarines, and managing three hundred employees, a $70 million budget and Navy testing facilities estimated at almost $2 billion nationwide. He directed the acquisition of major facilities including the Maneuvering and Seakeeping Basin, Rotating Arm, 36-inch Variable Pressure Water Tunnel, and the Large Cavitation Channel (now named in his honor). Morgan was given numerous awards from national and international technical societies, academia, and the Navy. He is the only U.S. citizen to receive the William Froude Medal from the Royal Institute of Naval Architects.

Rogosin worked in political cinema, non-fiction partisan filmmaking and docufiction, influenced by Italian neorealism and Robert Flaherty. Biography =Early life= Born and raised on the East Coast of the United States, he was the only son of textile industry mogul and philanthropist Israel Rogosin. Lionel Rogosin attended Yale University and obtained a degree in chemical engineering in order to join his father's business. He served in the United States Navy during World War II. Upon his return, he spent his free time traveling in war- ridden Eastern Europe and Western Europe and Israel as well as a trip to Africa in 1948. He then worked in his father's company until 1954, while teaching himself film with a 16mm Bolex camera. Concerned with political issues including racism and fascism, Rogosin participated in a United Nations film titled Out, a documentary about the plight of Hungarian refugees. =Career change= At this juncture, Rogosin devoted himself to promoting peace and confronting issues such as nuclear war, imperialism, and racism. Apartheid was his first target, but in order to make a film against it, he decided to learn by filming the Bowery, New York's skid row, an effort influenced by the documentaries of Robert J. Flaherty. Thus he made On the Bowery in 1955-1956 in the tradition of neo-realism. The film was the first American film to receive the Grand Prize for Documentary at the Venice Film Festival in 1956. It also received a British Academy Film Award in 1956, and was nominated for an Academy Award. On the Bowery received critical acclaim and made a great impression in Eastern Europe and England. The newly formed Free Cinema in London, founded by Lindsay Anderson, Lorenza Mazzetti, Karel Reisz, and Tony Richardson, invited Rogosin for its second program. Turning to the struggle against Apartheid, Rogosin, with a small crew and under the pretense of making a commercial film on African music, clandestinely documented the life of a black South African migrant worker in Johannesburg. Completed in 1958 with nonprofessional actors and a young African singer named Miriam Makeba, Come Back, Africa won the Critics' Film Award at the Venice Film Festival. Rogosin arranged for Makeba to leave South Africa by bribing officials. He placed her under contract and arranged her first appearance on American television, on The Steve Allen Show. Rogosin supported Makeba financially, paying for her trip and living expenses when she left South Africa and traveled throughout Europe and the United States. =Film exhibition and distribution= Aware of the difficulties of distributing independent films in the United States, Rogosin purchased the Bleecker Street Cinema in New York City in 1960. The Bleecker became one of the most important independent art houses in New York, [along with the New Yorker and the Thalia] and a form of cinema university for emerging filmmakers such as Milo≈° Forman and Francis Ford Coppola as well as many critics and cineastes. In the same period, he was a founding and active member of the New American Cinema movement and The Film-Makers' Cooperative, along with Jonas and Adolfas Mekas, Shirley Clarke, Robert Downey Sr. and many others, whose films were shown at the Bleecker Street Cinema. Between 1960 and 1965, Rogosin traveled the world to gather material for his antinuclear war film Good Times, Wonderful Times, which was presented as the British entry at the Venice Film Festival in 1965. It was also shown at many American universities during the Vietnam War. Rogosin founded Impact Films in 1965 to distribute many political and independent films. The same year, Rogosin organized, along with others including Bertrand Russell, the British Artists' Protest, in August 1965, and the European Artists' Protest, in December 1965, against the Vietnam War. In 1966, he tried his hand at comedy by filming two short, low-budget films called How Do You Like Them Bananas and Oysters Are in Season while running the Bleecker Street Cinema and Impact Films. =Final films= In the 1970s, with rising financial difficulties, Rogosin made low-budget films supported by European television stations. Two of them, Black Roots and Black Fantasy, dealt with economic and social hardships faced by African-Americans. He made Woodcutters of the Deep South about a black and white cooperative, and finally Arab-Israeli Dialogue, an attempt to give a voice and meeting ground to both parties through a discussion between a Palestinian poet and an Israeli journalist. Rogosin sold the Bleecker Street Theater in 1974 and brought Impact Films to an end in 1978. Though he continued to develop many film projects on subjects such as Navajo Indians, police brutality, Paul Gauguin, and a musical about street children in Brazil, he never was able to raise enough money to film them. Despite critical success in Europe and among other American independent filmmakers, he was by and large neither recognized nor supported in the US. He moved to England in the 1980s where he turned to writing. With his health deteriorating, he went back to Los Angeles in the late 1990s. He died in Los Angeles in December 2000. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood, California.

Internet services provided by the three major Internet service providers (ISPs) are subject to regulation by the MDA, which requires blocking of a symbolic number of websites containing \\"mass impact objectionable\\" material, including Playboy, YouPorn and Ashley Madison. The civil service, tertiary institutions and Institute of Technical Education has its own jurisdiction to block websites displaying pornography, information about drugs and online piracy. History In 1996, the Singapore government's Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) began monitoring Internet activity and content. Under their guidelines, all ISPs are licensed by the SBA and therefore are subject to the Internet Code of Practice that outlined prohibited online material. Prohibited material was any content or activity that could be seen as \\"objectionable on the grounds of public interest, public morality, public order, public security, national harmony, or is otherwise prohibited by applicable Singapore laws.\\" Political and racially sensitive content is frequently censored in Singapore, resulting in a chilling effect on bloggers and academics active on social media. The early to mid-2000s saw the rising popularity of satire websites such as TalkingCock.com and blogs like YawningBread and mrbrown, which offered alternative perspectives on socio- political issues from government-friendly mainstream media. These websites are often under scrutiny and potential targets of censorship. = Cases = In July 2001, Dr Tan Chong Kee, the founder of Sintercom, was asked to register the website under the nascent Singapore Broadcast Authority Act (now Media Development Authority). Dr Tan chose to shut down Sintercom due to concerns over the ambiguity of the Act.Tan Chong Kee. 'The Canary and the Crow: Sintercom and the State Tolerability Index' in Kenneth Paul Tan ed. Renaissance Singapore? Economy, Culture, and Politics. Singapore University Press 2007.Singapore-window.org Interview with Dr Tan Chong Kee, Singapore- Window, Accessed: 23-Dec-2006. In July 2006, mrbrown's weekly column in newspaper Today was terminated after he highlighted the immediate price hikes after the 2006 Singapore general elections. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said mrbrown's column had ‚Äò‚Äòhit out wildly at the government and in a very mocking and dismissive sort of tone‚Äô‚Äô and Minister for Information, Communication and the Arts sent a letter saying his article could undermine national stability, and that it was \\"not the role of journalists or newspapers in Singapore to champion issues, or campaign for or against the government\\". In 2012, blogger Alex Au was made by the Attorney General's Chambers and prime minister Lee Hsien Loong to remove his blog posts and apologise several times for various issues, including his questioning of the judicial sentencing of doctor Woffles Wu for a traffic offence, as well as his observations of the saga involving the sale of the ruling party's town councils' software to an IT firm. He was subsequently charged for scandalising the judiciary in 2015 for suggesting judicial partiality towards two constitutional challenges against the Singapore law criminalising sex between men in his blog posts. In 2015, a video made by the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), titled \\"Pappy Washing Powder\\", was deemed a party political film and thus prohibited under the Films Act.Today Online, 17 August 2015  Legislation  =Sedition Act= The Sedition Act inherited from the colonial era is also used to charge internet users deemed to have promoted feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the law was necessary to preserve Singapore's racial and religious harmony as ethnic tensions in South-east Asia may give rise to Islamic terrorism. There is continuing debate on whether the use of the Act will have a chilling effect on public debate on the Internet. A 2012 survey from Blackbox Research showed that 75% of the respondents felt that there was no need for legal action against racist online commenters, with 59% saying a formal warning should suffice for a first-time offender, and 16% indicating that it was sufficient to publicly shame them online. In September 2005, three people were arrested and charged under the Sedition Act for posting racist comments on the Internet.Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2005, United States Department of State, retrieved 20 March 2006. It was the first time the Act was invoked in Singapore for a decade and the first use by the government against individuals. In 2012, an assistant director at National Trades Union Congress membership department was fired for racist comments in Facebook. In a separate incident, a Chinese student was fined for his abusive comments towards Singaporeans.NTUC sacks staff for inappropriate Facebook comments, channelnewsasia.com, 8 October 2012., indiatimes.com, 2 January 2013. In the same year, Singaporean cartoonist Leslie Chew was charged with sedition for alleging official discrimination against the Malay population, on his Facebook page Demon-cratic Singapore. He was charged again for contempt of court for several cartoons questioning Singapore courts for their differential treatment, based on status of nationality and political affiliation of the defendants. The Sedition Act carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a fine of S$5,000 (US $3,939) if found guilty. However the government later withdrew the charge. Chew states that he ‚Äúwas interrogated for over 30 hours and placed under island arrest for 3 months and (had) to report for bail extension 6 times during that period.‚ÄùCartoonists Rights, 31 July 2013 In other incidents, teenagers and expatriates were arrested by the Singapore police over derogatory, offensive, abusive or threatening comments posted on social media., indiatimes.com, 2 January 2013.Bloomberg, 26 July 2015New York Times, 24 March 2016 Academic Cherian George noted that in most cases, state action to prosecute individuals was instigated by complaints from members of the public, and the offensive content were spread further by those reporting the offence. He argued that internet users should be able to partake in open debates and opinion leaders can make a collective stand against ideas contrary to Singaporean ethos, without the need for government to intervene and censor or punish. = Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) = In 2017, the Singaporean government said it was considering laws targeting online misinformation and fake news websites. In May 2019, Parliament approved the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), in which ministers are given powers to stop certain falsehoods from spreading through media and internet platforms. For example, articles can be declared to contain falsehoods and the publisher directed to insert a link to the ministry's reply and 'corrections' - alongside the said article. Readers will still have access to the original article. Only in serious cases will offending articles be required to be taken down immediately. Individuals and organisations can appeal POFMA directives to the minister issuing them and then the courts, if their appeals are rejected. Google raised concerns that the law could hurt innovation, and rights groups said the government could use it to stifle online discussion. The law came into effect on 2 October 2019, and a few days later, The Online Citizen editor Terry Xu wrote a Facebook post saying the ruling could use POFMA to suppress whistleblower complaints during an election. The Ministry of Communications and Information disputed this post, saying appointed senior civil servants would enforce POFMA during election periods. = Broadcasting Act = In 2013, Singapore enacted a law requiring licenses for news sites that report regularly on the country, a move that critics of the ruling People‚Äôs Action Party see as an attempt to silence online dissent.Reuters, 26 July 2013 Sites which satisfy the criteria must also put up a performance bond of $50,000, and are expected to remove content that is perceived by the MDA to be against the public interest, public security, or national harmony within 24 hours. Aside from the online websites of state-owned newspapers, socio-political websites and news providers such as Yahoo Singapore, The Online Citizen, Mothership.sg, The Independent Singapore, The Middle Ground were all approached to register for the class license. =Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act= The Computer Misuse Act (CMA) was introduced in 1993 and its offence provisions are based primarily on the United Kingdom‚Äôs 1990 legislation of the same name.An Overview of Cybercrime Legislation and Cases in Singapore, Gregor Urbas, Asian Law Institute (ANU), October 2008. In the years since, the government has taken a much tougher stand on Internet-related matters, including censorship. Amendments to the Penal Code in 2006 hold Internet users liable for \\"causing public mischief\\", and give the authorities broader powers in regulating Internet content.Mixing welfare and elitism in Singapore, Alex Au, Asia Times Online, 23 November 2006.Consultation Paper on the Proposed Penal Code Amendments , Ministry of Home Affairs, 8 November 2006 Following the 2013 Singapore cyberattacks, the Computer Misuse Act was renamed to Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act. = Copyright Law = On 8 July 2014, Singapore passed amendments to its existing copyright law. The amendments allow copyrights holders to apply for court injunctions, making it compulsory for internet service providers block access to websites that \\"flagrantly-infringe\\" intellectual property. The new law took effect in December 2014 and in September 2016, at the request of the Motion Picture Association of America(MPAA), Solarmovie.ph became the first website to be blocked under the amended act. In May 2018, 53 torrent and streaming websites including The Pirate Bay, KickassTorrents and Solarmovie.sc were blocked following an application by the MPAA, after 4 years of discussions. = Remote Gambling Act = On 7 October 2014, the government passed the \\"Remote Gambling Act\\". Under the new law it is an offence, punishable by jail terms and fines, for people to place bets on overseas gambling websites from Singapore. Advertisements for gambling websites are also outlawed. The law took effect on 1 February 2015 when several hundred remote gambling websites were blocked.\\"Singapore Blocks Access to Overseas Gambling Websites\\", Agence France-Presse (AFP), 3 February 2015. Retrieved 26 April 2015. Banned websites The IMDA (previously the MDA) maintains a list of more than 100 banned websites. When trying to access a blocked site, visitors are usually greeted by an IMDA or error message depending on the individual ISP and web filtering service. The MDA message is only applicable to public places and office buildings. The Site Blocked message is applicable to most homes.

Mendel) from 1901 to 1914, and Bebb and Gould (with Carl F. Gould) from 1914 to 1939. Bebb was also important in the development of the architectural terra cotta industry in Washington State, and he was an early participant in the Washington State Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (predecessor to today's AIA Seattle Chapter). Biography Eldest son of solicitor Henry Charles Lewis Bebb and Jessie Green (daughter of John \\"Paddy\\" Green of Evans Hotel, Covent Garden), Charles was born on 10 April 1856 at 11 Silchester Road, Kensington, London, England, where he spent his childhood. Notting Hill, London, England. He later claimed he was born 10 April 1856 on his US Naturalisation papers (8 December 1920). He was educated privately and he stated that he attended the University of Lausanne, and then studied at the School of Mines in London. In 1881 he was listed on the UK census as a Law Student living with his Aunt, Alice Green in Lee, London. After a stint in South Africa as a railroad construction engineer, Bebb returned to London (17 February 1885) aboard R.M.S. \\"Athenian\\" and instead of going to Australia to join his father, he came to the United States as an Engineer (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 15 April 1885 aboard \\"British Prince\\") and lived as a boarder in Chicago, listing as a Surveyor. He said that he joined the Illinois Terra Cotta Lumber Company where he became involved in the development of fireproofing materials. In 1887, Bebb went to work for Chicago architects Adler and Sullivan as a superintending architect at 118 Dearborn Street (1887), Takoma Building (1889) and 1600 Auditorium Building (1890). He came to Seattle in 1891 (Griffith House) to superintend construction of the firm's Seattle Opera House, but the project did not go forward and Bebb returned to Chicago. While in Chicago, he married (21 November 1888) Virginia Rutler Bush (n√©e Burns) adopting her son Joseph Crispia Bush (Bebb). Bebb came permanently to Seattle in 1893 and went to work for the Denny Clay Company, which, with his assistance, began to produce architectural terra cotta. Bebb always saw himself as an architect, and he was an early member of the Washington State Chapter of the AIA, founded in 1894. By 1898, Bebb opened his own architectural practice. His early projects reflected the influence of Louis Sullivan in the use of terra cotta ornament with \\"Sullivanesque\\" designs. In February 1901, Bebb joined with Louis L. Mendel to form Bebb and Mendel. Over the next thirteen years their firm was one of the leading architectural practices in Seattle, designing homes, hotels, office buildings and institutional, commercial and industrial structures. The Hoge Building (1909‚Äì11) was Seattle's tallest when it was completed, but it was passed three years later by the Smith Tower. In early 1914 Bebb and Mendel dissolved their partnership. By mid-1914, Bebb had formed a new partnership, Bebb and Gould with Carl F. Gould. Their partnership agreement gave primary responsibility for management, engineering, specifications and construction to Bebb; planning and design, though the responsibility of both partners, were primarily allocated to Gould. The firm's early success in winning the commission for the University of Washington campus plan propelled it to prominence and Bebb and Gould won many significant institutional commissions over the next two decades. Bebb was among the early members of the Washington State Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. He served as the Chapter president in 1902, 1903 and 1904. He was elected a Fellow of the AIA in 1919. Bebb was never directly involved in architectural education, but several years after Carl F. Gould became head of the architecture program at the University of Washington, Bebb provided funds for an award for an annual student competition called the \\"Bebb Prize.\\" In 1924, when Bebb was 68, he began to gradually reduce his participation in the firm. However, he remained a partner with a share in the practice until Gould's unexpected death in 1939. Bebb carried on by taking draftsman John Paul Jones into partnership and renaming the firm Bebb and Jones. This partnership was short-lived as Bebb died in June 1942. Thereafter Jones continued the firm as Jones and Bindon with new partner Leonard Bindon.  References  * Booth, T.

He was an expert in releasing agunot from their husbands, who abandoned them without divorce. The Poisic (also Poisik, Posek, Possek) family is a rabbinical family originated in the Shapira family and connected to it in marriage relationships. The Poisic members were active in Ukraine. Rabbi Hillel Poisic's father, Rabbi Elijah Poisic (1859-1932), was one of the most important Rabbis in Ukraine. He served as rabbi in Mohlika and in Zlatopol and composed Responsa and halakhic books about Sukkot, Maimonides and the letter of divorce (get). His expertise was in circumcision law. His mother, Matalia, daughter of Zwi Sonik, was the granddaughter of Rabbi Chaim Chaikel Shapira from Kalininblatt (in Kiev district), father of Rabbi Judah Josef Loeb Shapira, president of the rabbinical court in Rakhmistrivka, and R. Israel Volodarsky, president of court in Petrikovka (in Kherson district). Rabbi Hillel studied Torah with his father and grandfather, Rabbi Moshe Zvi Poisic. He received his ordination as rabbi by the most important rabbis in south Russia, Rabbi Moshe Nathan Rubinstein from Vinnitsa and the Rabbi Yosef Halperin, president of the court of the Jewish community in Odessa. Biography In 1898 Rabbi Hillel Poisic was married to Gitel (Tovah), the daughter of his uncle R. Selig Shapira. In 1899-1921 R. Hillel served as rabbi in Zlatopol and was elected by both the Jewish community and the Ukrainian authorities as a religious rabbi and a formal rabbi. When the pogroms began in Ukraine (in 1920) and the different gangs of robbers oppressed him much and threw him to the jail for several times, he decided to move to Romania. In 1921 he escaped together with his family from the revolt, pogroms and religions suppression in Russia. He went through many tribulations of travel till he arrived in 1921 to Bessarabia (east Moldova), which belonged to Romania that time. He served one year as rabbi in Markulshty and later on in Tatarbunary, Bessarabia (Akkerman district, Romania-Bessarabia). He was received there as a \\"Romanian citizen\\" and as a formal rabbi. He was also a Jewish religions teacher in the governmental high schools. There he began again to be engaged in communal work; he founded charity institutions and distributed the Torah amongst the poor. During 1921-1935 he was active in favor of Zionism and served as communal worker of \\"Ha-Mizrachi\\" in Romania. In 1925 he organized a group of Jews from his community to acquire land in Bnei Brak through the company \\"New Palestine\\" from Kishinev. In 1929 and 1932 his wife visited in Israel, each time for approximately a whole year, and visited in all kinds of institutes and settlements. In 1935, as the situation in Romania deteriorated and as the antisemitism was strengthened, Rabbi Hillel decided to immigrate to Israel, and on Passover evening 1935 he arrived to Israel together with his family and influenced successfully many other from his community to immigrate to Israel. He settled in Tel-Aviv and devoted himself to arrange his works in Torah issues and to complete parts of his works that were lost during his wanderings in Russia. In 1938 he established an association/office in order to help to free agunot (in Hebrew, sing. agunah), namely deserted (abandoned) wives, whose husbands have disappeared without divorcing them. In 1940-1953 he edited and composed the monthly magazine Ha-Possek for Halakha and Aggadah issues, including responses in these issues. Besides he also compiled and edited the works of his father, prepared a book about civil marriage and divorce in Russia (1952) and published about Torah and Judaism issues.

The engagement was part of a military campaign to break the power of Soyo in the region. The Portuguese won a decisive victory, inflicting heavy casualties and killing the Soyon leader. Pre-Battle Situation and the Kongo Civil War In 1665 the Kingdom of Kongo clashed with their one-time allies the Portuguese at the Battle of Mbwila.Thornton, John K: \\"Warfare in Atlantic Africa 1500-1800,\\" 1999. Routledge. Page 103. The engagement resulted in a crushing Portuguese victory ending in the death of the Mwenekongo Ant√≥nio I and most of the kingdom's nobility. Afterwards, Kongo erupted in a brutal civil war between the House of Kinlaza, which had ruled under the dead king, and the House of Kimpanzu.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 69. Cambridge University, 1998 Soyo, home to many Kimpanzu partisans, was eager to take advantage of the chaos.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684-1706\\", page 78. Cambridge University, 1998 Within a few months of the national tragedy at Mbwila, the Prince of Soyo invaded the capital of S√£o Salvador and installed his prot√©g√©, Afonso II on the throne. This happened again in 1669 with the placement of √Ålvaro IX on the throne.Gray, Richard: \\"Black Christians & White Missionaries\\", page 38. Yale University, 1990 By this time both the Portuguese and the central authorities in Kongo were growing tired of Soyo's meddling. While the Kinlaza and others in Kongo lived in fear of a Soyo invasion, the governor of Luanda was afraid of the growing power of Soyo. With access to Dutch merchants willing to sell them guns and cannons plus diplomatic access to the Pope, Soyo was on its way to becoming as powerful as Kongo had been before Mbwila. Committing to the unthinkable, the weak central authority in Kongo asked Luanda to invade Soyo.Birmingham, David: \\"Portugal and Africa\\", page 61. Palgrave Macmillan, 1999 In return, Portugal was promised money, mineral concessions and the right to build a fortress in Soyo to keep out the Dutch. Engagement The Kingdom of Kongo showing major factions in the civil war Responding to a plea by King Rafael I, a Portuguese colonial army from Luanda was dispatched to conquer Kongo's rebel province of Soyo in June 1670. The Count of Soyo Est√™v√£o da Silva and his brother Prince Paulo da Silva moved with a force of BaKongo musketeers intermixed with heavy infantry holding the shields for which BaKongo soldiers were famous to meet the force.Thornton, John K: \\"Warfare in Atlantic Africa 1500-1800\\", page 121. Routledge, 1999 The armies met just north of the Mbidizi River. The Portuguese were immediately successful, just as they had been in earlier engagements against Kongo at Mbwila and Mbumbi. The Portuguese use of grapeshot inflicted many casualties on the Soyo army and forced them to retreat. Est√™v√£o da Silva was among the dead. Enthused by their victory, the Portuguese captured the enemies' shields and marched further anticipating further combat at another location and hoping for a chance to show off their own talents in swordsmanship.Thornton, John K: \\"Warfare in Atlantic Africa 1500-1800\\", page 105.

Triangulum was named after the constellation Triangulum. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. Construction Triangulum was laid down 14 May 1943, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull No. 1669, as the Liberty ship SS Eugene B. Daskam, by California Shipbuilding Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California; renamed Triangulum 27 May 1943; launched 6 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. D. H. Mann; acquired by the Navy on 19 June 1943, from the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on a \\"bareboat\\" basis; converted to Navy use at the Destroyer Base, San Diego, California; and commissioned on 30 July 1943, Commander Eugene J. Kingsland, USNR, in command. Service history  The ship was one of five Navy manned Liberties assigned 8 December 1943, to the Southwest Pacific Area for service under operational control of the Commander, US Seventh Fleet in meeting US Army requirements. Assigned to the Naval Transportation Service (NTS), the auxiliary cargo ship moved up the coast to load cargo at San Francisco, California, and stood out to sea with a convoy on 28 August, bound for the New Hebrides. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 2 October, and, for the next five months, shuttled troops and cargo between ports in Australia and New Guinea. = Landing troops at Humboldt Bay = Triangulum embarked part of a battalion of Army combat engineers at Lae and sortied on 14 April 1944, with Task Group (TG) 77.1, the Western Attack Group, for the invasion of Hollandia. On the morning of 22 April, she began landing her 700 troops on the beaches of Humboldt Bay. The ship completed discharging cargo by 18:00 the next day and departed in a convoy bound, via Buna, for Milne Bay. She then resumed her supply runs between Australia and New Guinea. = Supplying the troops during the Philippine invasion = The ship loaded combat cargo at Manus and got underway for Hollandia on 7 November, to rendezvous with a convoy proceeding to the Philippines. She arrived at Leyte Gulf on 19 November, and began discharging supplies. During her visit there, Japanese planes frequently attacked Allied shipping; and, during a raid on Thanksgiving Day, four of her men were wounded by friendly antiaircraft fire. = End-of-war activity = On 4 December, she departed the area for Australia and, after calling at Hollandia, arrived at Brisbane, Australia, on 17 December 1944. Triangulum shuttled supplies from Australia to South Pacific bases, mostly in New Guinea, for the next year. The supply runs were broken by three voyages to the Philippines: in January, May, and August 1945. On 8 November, she stood out of Leyte to load cargo at Hollandia, Biak, Milne Bay, and Manus to be transported to the United States.  Post-war decommissioning  On the last day of 1945, the ship arrived at San Francisco, where she was stripped for inactivation and ordered to join the Reserve Fleet in Hawaii. Triangulum arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 February 1946, and was decommissioned there on 15 April. In May 1947, she was towed back to San Francisco and returned to MARCOM on 2 July. Triangulum was struck from the Navy list on 17 July 1947. On 19 March 1973, she was sold to Nicolai Joffe Corporation, for $168,113, to be scrapped within 24 months. She was withdrawn from the fleet 27 July 1973. Awards Triangulum received two battle stars for World War II service.

Entom. de Belgique, Iv, pp. 192‚Äì197, 1911) summary > translation in Entomological News. 1911 Vol. xxii:467. History of discovery The larvae of the tumbu fly, Cordylobia anthropophaga, were first described in Senegal in 1862, and Blanchard first described the adult and gave it its name in 1872. In 1903, Gr√ºnberg placed the tumbu fly in a new genus, Cordylobia. Life cycle Female tumbu flies deposit around 300 eggs in sandy soil, often contaminated with feces. The hatched larvae can remain viable in the soil for 9‚Äì15 days, at which time they need to find a host to continue developing. If a larva finds a host, it penetrates the skin and takes 8‚Äì12 days developing through three larval stages before it reaches the prepupal stage. It then leaves the host, drops to the ground, buries itself, and pupates. It then becomes an adult fly able to reproduce and begin the cycle all over again. Clinical presentation in humans Successful penetrations in humans results in furuncular (boil-like) myiasis, typically on the backs of arms or about the waist, lower back, or buttocks. C. anthropophaga rarely causes severe problems, and mainly causes cutaneous myiasis. Geary et al. describe the presentation of cutaneous myiasis caused by the tumbu fly: \\"At the site of penetration, a red papule forms and gradually enlarges. At first the host may experience only intermittent, slight itching, but pain develops and increases in frequency and intensity as the lesions develop into a furuncle. The furuncle's aperture opens, permitting fluids containing blood and waste products of the maggot to drain.\\" Transmission Female tumbu flies lay their eggs in soil contaminated with feces or urine or on damp clothing or bed linens. Damp clothing hanging to dry makes for a perfect spot. The larvae hatch in 2‚Äì3 days and attach to unbroken skin and penetrate the skin, producing swelling and infection. If the larvae hatch in soil, any disturbance of the soil causes them to wriggle to the surface to penetrate the skin of the host. Reservoir and vector A natural reservoir is defined as an organism that can harbor a pathogen indefinitely with no ill effects. Although C. anthropophaga larvae can cause ill effects for animal hosts, relative to myiasis in humans, animal hosts are reservoirs. Many animals are hosts of C. anthropophaga. The dog is the most common domestic host and several species of wild rats are the preferred field hosts. Domestic fowl are dead-end hosts; the larvae cannot develop when they enter the tissue of a fowl. Humans are in fact accidental hosts; tumbu fly larvae do not usually infect humans and are not necessary for the transmission cycle of the fly. A vector is an organism that carries the parasites (the larvae) from one host to another. The tumbu fly itself is the vector in a loose sense, because the female deposits the eggs in soil or on damp cloth, where the larvae can hatch and attach to human or animal skin. Diagnostics Cutaneous myiasis caused by the tumbu fly should be suspected when a patient who has just spent time in Africa presents with ulcers or boil-like sores. Definitive diagnosis is only possible when the larvae are found. They should be removed and allowed to develop into adult flies for identification and examination purposes. Treatment When C. anthropophaga causes cutaneous myiasis, the larvae more often than not can be removed without any incision. Covering the punctum (the breathing hole) with petroleum jelly or similar substances cuts off the air supply and forces the maggot to the surface, where it is easy to capture with forceps. If this does not work, local anesthetic can be administered and an incision made to widen the punctum and remove the maggot. Another treatment discussed in the March 2014 Journal of the American Medical Association is to inject a combination of anaesthetic and epinephrine into the insect's chamber. Less drastically, because larvae of C. anthropophaga have smaller hooked bristles on the cuticle than those of Dermatobia hominis, it often is practical just to push on each side of the hole to squeeze the maggot out, especially after first enlarging the punctum. It is important not to burst the larva to prevent the risk of granulomatous or serious inflammatory reaction. Patients should be monitored for additional and subsequent lesions, as development does not occur in unison and some larvae may take longer to reach the prepupal stage. Antiseptics or antibiotics may be useful to prevent bacterial infection after removal of the larvae, but in practice are not often necessary; the secretions of the larva tend to discourage bacterial growth. As a rule, the wound may be expected to heal readily. Epidemiology The tumbu fly is endemic to the tropical regions of Africa, south of the Sahara. Myiasis caused by C. anthropophaga is the most common cause of myiasis in Africa, but can be seen worldwide because of air travel, as human movements carry infestation outside endemic areas. Public health and prevention strategies The fly commonly infects humans by laying its eggs on wet clothes, left out to dry. The eggs hatch in one to three days and the larvae (which can survive without a host for up to 15 days) then burrow into the skin when the clothes are worn. A prevention method is to iron all clothes, including underwear, which kills the eggs/larvae.

As of 2018, Iran has an estimate Internet penetration rate of between 64% to 69% out of a population of about 82 million. As of 2012, an average of 27% of Internet sites were blocked at a given time and as of 2013 almost 50% of the top 500 visited websites worldwide were blocked, including YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Blogger. The Iranian government and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Sepah are interested in block all social media such as Netflix , YouTube , Facebook and Hulu. The blocked sites have a wide range of topics including health, science, sports, news, pornography and shopping. The Internet in Iran is managed by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Supreme Council of Cyberspace of Iran. The head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of IRI is elected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. The Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei believes that the Internet is just an invention by the enemies of Iran to use it against the Iranian people. The sixth president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and Ayatollah Khamenei agreed on internet censorship in Iran. Therefore Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ordered to increase internet censorship. Also in 2005 - 2018, Ayatollah Khamenei sent letters one after another to the Iranian government, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of IRI , and especially the Revolutionary Guards (Sepah) ordered the formation of a national intranet, that called the National Information Network. However, Ayatollah Khamenei and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad post a lot on filtered or blocked social networks in Iran such as Facebook and Twitter, and that has made the tourists have traveled to Iran and even the Iranian people more dissatisfied. National Information Network (NIN) was unveiled during the 2019 Iranian protests. The National Information Network works like the Great Firewall of China, but with stricter monitoring and controlling watchfully of users. The business of selling virtual private networks (VPNs), SOCKS, and proxy servers in Iran is worth millions of U.S. dollars due to the large demand. The twelfth minister of Iran Communication State announced that the lucrative business of selling VPNs and proxies has had huge profits for it manufacturers and retailers, and there are efforts to stop some of the businesses. At the beginning of March 2012, Iran began implementing an internal intranet. This effort is partially in response to Western actions to exploit its Internet connectivity, such as the Stuxnet cyberattack, which have fueled suspicions of foreign technologies. The government's and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Sepah response has included requiring the use of Iranian email systems, blocking popular webmail services, inhibiting encryption use by disabling VPNs and HTTPS, and banning externally developed security software. Iran is one of the countries most strongly identified with internet censorship. Beginning on November 17, 2019, in response to the 2019 Iranian fuel protests, an internet shutdown reduced internet traffic in the country to 5% of normal levels. The internet is now being gradually reactivated in some areas.  History  When first introduced, the Internet services provided by the government within Iran were comparatively open.

The body which is called The Supreme Council of Virtual Space will consist of the president, culture and information minister, the police and Revolutionary Guard chiefs. Their task will be to define policy and coordinate decisions regarding the Internet. This is thought to be the country's authorities strongest attempt at controlling the Internet so far. Internet service providers Every ISP must be approved by both the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI) and the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, and must implement content-control software for websites and e-mail. ISPs face heavy penalties if they do not comply with the government filter lists. At least twelve ISPs have been shut down for failing to install adequate filters.Reporters Without Borders. \\"Report on Iran\\" . Retrieved December 9, 2006. The state blocklist consists of about 15,000 websites forbidden by the Iranian government.

As of 2006, Iran's SmartFilter is configured to filter local Persian-language sites, and block prominent English-language sites, such as the websites of the BBC and Facebook. The software effectively blocks access to most pornographic sites, gay and lesbian sites, reformist political sites, news media, sites that provide tools to help users cloak their Internet identity, and other sites nebulously defined as immoral on various grounds. Iran has been accused by its critics of censoring more Internet sites than any other nation except China. Iran has since developed its own hardware and software for filtering purposes. The architecture of the Iranian Internet is particularly conducive to widespread surveillance as all traffic from the dozens of ISPs serving households is routed through the state-controlled telecommunications infrastructure of the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). The Kurdish Wikipedia was blocked for several months in 2006, according to Reporters Without Borders. American proxy server Iranians can sometimes access 'forbidden' sites through proxy servers, although these machines can be blocked as well. In 2003, the United States began providing a free proxy server to Iranian citizens through its IBB service Voice of America with Internet privacy company Anonymizer, Inc. The proxy website changes whenever the Iranian government blocks it. However, even the U.S. proxy filters pornographic websites and keywords. \\"There's a limit to what taxpayers should pay for,\\" an IBB program manager was quoted as saying.Poulson, K.

Retrieved 6/23/09. The company has denied that what it sold to TCI had such capacity but only lawful intercept capacity relative to child pornography e.g.; Andrew Lighten, a NSN employee, however, states that the company does not have products for Deep Packet Inspection, and only provided Iran lawful interception capability for 3G UMTS mobile networks, which he states, is a fundamental requirement of the UMTS network as defined by the ETSI standards. Iran is reported to use deep packet inspection to detect connections to TLS- based VPNs, and TCP reset attacks to interfere with them. Internet connection speed restrictions Iranian government uses speed throttling as a means of frustrating users and limiting communication. Significant speed drop of Internet communications in the days following the 2009 Iranian presidential election, weeks leading to 2013 election, and during times of international political upheaval, including during the Arab Spring are examples of such behavior. In October 2006, the Iranian government ordered all ISPs to limit their download speeds to 128kbit/s for all residential clients and Internet cafes. Although no reason for the decree was given, it is widely believed the move was designed to reduce the amount of western media (e.g. films and music) entering the country.Reuters. (2006.) \\"Iran cuts Internet speeds to homes, cafes\\"\\" . Reuters.com. There is also a newfound state awareness of how domestically produced content considered undesirable can pervade the Internet, highlighted by the 2006 controversy over the appearance of a celebrity sex tape featuring a popular Iranian soap opera actress (or a convincing look- alike). (See the Iranian sex tape scandal) As of 2010, most major ISPs in Tehran offer 1 Mbit/s for 2,190,000 rials/month (around 60 dollars/month), 2Mbit/s for 3,950,000 rials/month (around 115 dollars/month) for unlimited data traffic. 1 Mbit/s with 2 GB traffic limitation costs 189,000 rials/month (around 9 dollars/month). Note these prices are just for Tehran. Prices are usually higher in other cities. Restriction for the residential client speed of 128kbit/s is still in place and the speeds mentioned above are just for offices and commercial firms. However, the situation got better in the years afterward, and as of Oct. 2019 a major ISP provided 40Mbit/s Internet with 100GB of data per month, only for 850,000 IRR (about 8 USD). Others provide unlimited data traffic plans with up to 16Mb/s speed, just for 260,000 IRR/month (about 2.25 USD) Monitoring According to the American newspaper The Washington Times, Iran is using lawful intercept capabilities of telecommunications system to monitor communications by political dissidents on the Internet. A \\"monitoring center\\" installed by Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) for Irantelecom intercepts Web-based communications and archives them for Iranian law enforcement officials. Lily Mazahery, a human rights and immigration lawyer who represents Iranian dissidents, reported that one of her clients was arrested because of instant messaging he had participated in with Ms. Mazahery, > He told me he had received a call from the Ministry of Intelligence, and > this guy when he went to the interrogation, they put in front of him printed > copies of his chats with me. He said he was dumbfounded, and he was sent to > prison. According to a newly passed legislation, Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Iran are required to store all the data sent or received by each of their clients. ISPs may delete the data no sooner than 3 months after the expiry of each client's contract. Out of country protests following the 2009 elections resulted in Iran increasing their monitoring of online social networks, especially targeting Facebook. Upon re-entry to the country, citizens that have lived abroad have been questioned and detained due to the contents of their personal Facebook pages. Post 2009-election developments Following the 2009 election protests, Iran ratified the Computer Crimes Law (CCL) by 2010. The CCL codified into law regulations for Internet censorship. Notable provisions of the CCL include: Article 10 which effectively prohibits Internet users and companies from using encryption, or protecting data, in a manner that would ‚Äúdeny access of authorised individuals to data, computer and telecommunication systems‚Äù; Article 14 which criminalises ‚Äúproducing, sending, publishing, distributing, saving or financially engaging in obscene content‚Äù; Article 21 which imposes a sweeping requirement for ISPs to maintain records of Internet traffic data and the personal information of their Internet users; and Article 48 that requires Internet Service Providers to record data from telephone conversations over the internet. In April 2011, a senior official, Ali Agha-Mohammadi announced government plans to launch a \\"halal internet\\",Peccia, T., Meda, R., (2016) The Impact of Social Media in Modern Societies: Highlighting New Ideological Barriers, Geostrategic Divisions and Future Prospects, Scienza e Pace, Research Paper, University of Pisa. which would conform to Islamic values and provide \\"appropriate\\" services.

In May 2012 Iran criticized Google for dropping the name \\"Persian Gulf\\" from its maps, leaving the feature unlabelled. Six days after Khamenei's statement, Iran announced that Google and Gmail would be added to the list of banned sites, to be replaced by a domestic Internet network largely isolated from the World Wide Web. Iranian media reported that the new system would be ready by March 2013. The new network already hosts some government and academic sites. The isolation of the separate network was also touted as an improvement to network security, in the wake of the Stuxnet worm attack on Iranian's main uranium enrichment facility. A computer virus was also found in Iran's major Kharg Island oil export terminal in April.

In August 2019, access to free services on Github, Gitlab, as well as Amazon Cloud services were suspended for users inside Iran. The Amazon Cloud suspension has had particularly severe collateral impacts, as Amazon Cloud hosts the majority of circumvention tools needed to bypass the government filters restricting access to online content. This development has forced developers working inside Iran to use unsafe hosting tools, leaving their websites vulnerable to cyberattack and risking users‚Äô security. In December 2018, the platform Slack temporarily suspended access to its services for all users who had ever connected to the platform from Iranian IP addresses. Slack reinstated those accounts under public pressure, while continuing to suspend its services to users connecting directly from Iran. Since March 2018, Apple has made the App Store unavailable in Iran, with significant impacts on the ability of people in the country to communicate online. The blocking of Telegram in April 2018 resulted in collateral blocking of WhatsApp and the disabling of many VPNs.

As a student music project at Macquarie University, the band assembled a group of songs reworked from The Cockroaches as well as arrangements of children's music. It is the only album to feature the fifth wiggle Phillip Wilcher. The album sold 100,000 copies, and received Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) and Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) awards. Background and development Phillip Wilcher, who was an early member of the Wiggles and \\"contributed the most musically to the debut album\\". In 1991, while working with the early childhood music department at Macquarie University, Phillip Wilcher met musician and former member of the Australian rock group The Cockroaches, Anthony Field, who was studying child development. According to Wilcher, Field asked him to join The Wiggles, which would become \\"Australia's foremost children's entertainment act\\", and to help them produce the album. The album was dedicated to the memory of Paul Field's infant daughter, Bernadette, who had died of SIDS in 1988. Wilcher financed and \\"contributed the most musically to the debut album\\", composing 75% of the music. Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album. They needed a keyboardist \\"to bolster the rock-n-roll feel of the project\\", so Field asked his old bandmate Fatt, for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project.According to Field, the four original members of The Wiggles, with Page's \\"mellifluous voice\\" and \\"perfect children's music instrument\\", Cook's knowledge of child development, Fatt's \\"incredible musicianship and gentle persona\\" that appealed to children, and Field's energy, balanced each other (Field, p. 44). Recording sessions were held at Wilcher's home,Sams, Christine. (1 August 2005). \\"The Fifth Wiggle speaks out\\". The Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 2007-01-22. and the album cost approximately A$4,000 to produce. The group reworked a few Cockroaches tunes to better fit the genre of children's music; for example, according to Field, a Cockroaches song he wrote, \\"Mr. Wiggles Back in Town\\" became \\"Get Ready to Wiggle\\" and inspired the band's name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance. There was also a piece by Phillip Wilcher, \\"Summer Dance\\", that appeared on the album, as \\"Archie's Theme\\". Promotion and release At first, The Wiggles filmed two music videos with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to promote their first album; they also decided to create a self-produced, forty-minute long video version of their album. Finances were limited, so there was no post-production editing of the video project. They used Field's nieces and nephews as additional cast, and hired the band's girlfriends to perform in character costumes. Cook's wife made their first costumes. They used two cameras and visually checked the performance of each song; that way, according to Paul Field, it took them less time to complete a forty-minute video than it took other production companies to complete a three-minute music video. Jeremy Fabinyi, The Cockroaches' former manager, became The Wiggles' first manager. Using connections gained during The Cockroaches years, he negotiated with the ABC to air their TV show and to help them promote their first recording. Field distributed copies of their album to his young students to test out the effect of the group's music on children; one child's mother returned it the next day because her child would not stop listening to it, having listened to the track Dorothy the Dinosaur 40 times. The album sold 100,000 copies in 1991. Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) awarded the band members, including Wilcher, with gold and platinum certificates for the album. In 1992, Wilcher left The Wiggles and submitted a letter of resignation because he wanted to continue composing classical music. According to fellow member, Greg Page, \\"Archie had considerable input into the arrangement of some songs on that first CD ... he is quite a musical genius ... his creative flair suited those kinds of pieces ... However ... the musical direction of The Wiggles was changing\\".

It is subtitled \\"or The Language of the Flowers\\" and described as \\"a poem of 1900 Granada, divided into various gardens, with scenes of song and dance\\".Garc√≠a Lorca (1970, 133). It was written in 1935 and first performed in the same year. \\"The theme of the play\\", suggests Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, \\"is the passage of time\\" (which Lorca had developed in a different form in his experimental surrealist play When Five Years Pass in 1931).Garc√≠a Lorca (1963, 18). Do√±a Rosita is a young woman who falls in love with a man who is called to South America to join his parents. He swears to return and Rosita waits, but learns that he has married someone else. Lorca portrays what he called \\"the grotesque treatment of women\\" in Spain.Leslie Stainton (1999). The action is set in Granada, Spain in three different years, portraying the bourgeois life of the 1880s and the social modernization and beginning of World War I of the early 1900s. Lorca draws parallels between Do√±a Rosita's life and these historic periods, beginning with the vitality of her youth, the attainment of maturity, and finally the loss of all hope. The key moment in the play occurs when a young relative addresses Rosita as Do√±a Rosita. This form of address signals her change of status. Works cited * Garc√≠a Lorca, Federico. 1970.
