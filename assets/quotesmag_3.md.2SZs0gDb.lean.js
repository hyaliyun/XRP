It premiered at the Freemason's Hall at the 1957 Edinburgh Festival to a sold-out house and an overwhelming success.

Geommu is performed with special costume, dance moves, and music. The dance is known for its grace in performance. Extra emphasis is placed on the movement of the costuming, notably the sleeves, in harmony with the movements of the dancer. The symbolic use of ssang dan geom, i.e. a replica of dual short swords, keeps to the militaristic origins of this dance. Geom-mu has become a dance of great beauty and is treasured as the South Korea's 12th Important Intangible Cultural Property. History Detail from an early-19th-century Korean painting titled \\"Ssanggeom daemu\\" (ÈõôÂäçÂ∞çËàû) by Hyewon, depicting a kisaeng performing Geommu. According to legend, Geommu originated during the later portion of the Three Kingdoms of Korea with estimates placing it near 660 AD. At that time, Korea was divided into the three kingdoms, Silla, Baekje, and Goguryeo. The legend of Geommu states that a young boy in Shilla named Hwangchang had an unusual talent for sword dance. His talent brought him great fame, even in the enemy kingdom, Baekje. One day, a king of Baekje invited him to his court to perform his great skill. The boy performed but in an act of great defiance killed the king before the royal assembly. Hwangchang was executed by the Baekje military. People in Shilla expressed their respect and sorrow at Hwangchang‚Äôs death by dancing in imitation of Hwangchang‚Äôs abilities, adorning a mask which was made to resemble his face. Thereafter, people named this dance \\"Hwangchangmu‚Äù. Surviving as a folk dance and cultural asset, Geommu was considerably changed during the Joseon Dynasty period from 1392 through 1910. At that point Geommu was rearranged by the Royal Court and recreated by the Kisaeng. The Kisaeng learned the formalized dance through the Gwonbeon, a pre-Korean War performance institution comparable to the Geisha tradition of Japan. One major change was the Kisaeng performers discontinued wearing the traditional mask while dancing Geommu. Geommu has remained a Court dance in the form of Jinju Geommu but has also retained its status as a primarily female dance. Geommu was also modified to use a replica sword while performing to prevent accidental injuries to the performer and audience. Costume and sword Swords Dancers of Geommu wear Hanbok, Kwaeja (overcoat), Jeon-Dae (belt), and Jeon-Rip (military style cap). Hanbok is the traditional Korean dress that consists of Chima (a skirt) and Jeogori (a jacket). These elements combine to form a stylized version of the Joseon Dynasty military uniform. The costume traditionally has the colors of blue, red, yellow, green and black but many regional variations exist. The Jinju region has a blue Chima and a jade green Jeogori. Gwangju in the Jeolla province has a red Chima and a light green Jeogori. The knife or Kal (Ïπº) is the replica sword used in Geom-mu, also referred to as a short sword, dan geom or dan do (Îã®Í≤Ä/Îã®ÎèÑ). Between the blade and the handle of a Kal are three rings. These three rings have varying sizes and make sounds when performers dance the Geom-mu. Performing Geommu Geommu is a group dancing activity performed by 6 to 8 performers. It has two unique characters which are Chum-sawi, a dance motion, and 'Changdan, rhythmic cycle or ‚Äòlong and short‚Äô. There are three typical motions, Ipchum-sawi, Anjeon-sawi, and Yeonpungdae. In Ipchum-sawi the dancers form two rows and stand face to face. Anjeon-sawi is to dance kneeling down while maintaining the two rows of Ipchum-sawi. The last motion, Yeonpungdae, the dancers form a circle and rotate in pattern. Variations Geommu is a compound of the Korean words \\"Geom\\", meaning sword, and \\"mu\\", meaning dance. This name applies to the base martial form of the dance. The dance is also known by the term Hwangchangmu in reference to its origin story. The royal court version of the dance is called Jinju Geommu. Geommu and Changdan rhythmic patterns In Geommu, special rhythmic cycles called Changdan appear. Changdan is usually made by Janggu, a double-headed hourglass drum and Buk, a barrel drum. In Korea there are many variations of Changdan with each name designating a certain type of meter, tempo, and beat. Basic nature of Korean rhythmic patterns may be described as having these four main characteristics (Garland encyclopedia of world: East Asia- China, Japan, Korea, p. 901). * A length of time, short enough to be held easily in memory and quickly recognized. * A sense of speed (not tempo, which is related to beat) * A typical meter, which fills the length of time * Characteristic events the rhythmic pattern Types of traditional Korean music in Geommu The traditional Korean music of Geommu is Samhyeon-Nyukgak. Originally, Samhyeon designated three chordophones, Geomungo, Gayageum, and Hyangbipa and Nyukgak designated Buk, Janggu, Haegeum, and Piri at the Unified Shilla period from 654 to 780. The significance of Samhyeon had disappeared and remained the import of Nyukgak. Nowadays Samhyeonnyukgak indicates the wind instrumental music. It is used to accompany marching and dancing with 6 instruments, Haegeum, Janggu, Buk, Daegeum, and two Piri. Haegeum is a string instrument, resembling a violin. [Jangu] and [buk] are drums. Janggu is made from a hollow wooden body and two leather skins. The two sides produce sounds of different pitch and tone. Puk is a barrel-shaped with a round wooden body covered on both ends with animal skin. It is played with both an open hand and a wooden stick in the other hand. Daegeum and Piri are aerophones. Daegeum is a large bamboo transverse flute and Piri is a double reed instrument made of bamboo. Its large reed and cylindrical bore gives it a sound mellower than that of many other types of oboe. Preservation Many parts of Geommu have been lost over time. South Korea established a law in 1962 named the Cultural Properties Protection Act in order to protect Geommu and other intangible cultural properties. Geommu was named as the 12th intangible cultural property by law in 1967. Geommu is actively preserved and practiced primarily in the Jinju, Gyeongsangnamdo, South Korea.

The massacre of Vassy () was the murder of Huguenot worshippers and citizens in an armed action by troops of Francis, Duke of Guise, in Wassy, France, on 1 March 1562. The massacre is identified as the first major event in the French Wars of Religion. The series of battles that followed concluded in the signing of the Peace of Amboise (or Pacification Treaty of Amboise) the next year, on 19 March 1563. The events surrounding the massacre of Vassy were famously depicted in a series of forty engravings published in Geneva seven years later.Jean Ehrmann, \\"Massacre and Persecution Pictures in Sixteenth Century France\\" in Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, vol. 8, (1945), London: The Warburg Institute, pp. 195-199 Background= Religious politics  Beginning in the reign of Francis I, Protestants who followed the teachings of John Calvin, known as Huguenots, faced state-backed persecution in France. This persecution continued under his two successors, Henry II and Francis II the latter of whom died young in 1560. Catherine de' Medici, regent of Charles IX, proposed the Edict of January (or Edict of Saint-Germain) with the hopes that providing a measure of toleration to Calvinism would help France avoid further chaos of the kind that had engulfed the south-west of the country. The Parlement of Paris would however resist registration of the edict until 6 March 1562, as such it would not be in force at the time of the Duke's entry into Wassy.  Wassy and the Guise  Feudal overlords = The town of Wassy at the time of the massacre was home to a population of roughly 3000 and was a royal town. Despite being royal it possessed feudal ties to the Guise family, having been the Dower of Mary, Queen of Scots, the Duke of Guise's niece. The Guise also possessed part of the town in the form of the castle district overseen by the Captain Claude Tondeur, in which the Protestant meeting house where the massacre would occur was located. The region at large was the families power base, with their princely title coming from the seat of Joinville which was located only a few miles away from Wassy. These connections would play a role in Guise's justification for his actions after the fact. = The Growth of Protestantism = Despite its small size the town would see strong Huguenot activity beginning early. In 1533 Antoinette of Bourbon, the Duke of Guise's mother who managed his estates, would oversee the burning of a man caught preaching in the town. Despite persecution, the community would grow, aided by the sister church at Troyes with whom the town had many economic links. In 1561 the community would hold their first officiated service inside the town in the house of a draper, with an attendance of around 120. As the community continued to grow beyond 500, the pastor of Troyes, Gravelles would perform the towns first baptism on 13 December. The Christmas service would be attended by 900, making the town a Huguenot stronghold, with a higher percentage of Huguenots than Troyes or any other town in the region. In January Gravelles would depart the town back to his home, with a dedicated preacher named L√©onard Morel being sent out for the town from Calvin's base of Geneva. = Attempts at repression = This growth would not however be uncontested. News of public preaching reached Guise in November, and he despatched several gendarmes to the area with the aim of snuffing out the heresy, with little success. The town Cur√© Claude le Sain voiced his concerns about the public preaching to Antoinette, however she was unwilling to take action without the support of the Duke and the regions provincial governor, Francis I, Duke of Nevers who was a Protestant. In the wake of Gravelle's open baptism, Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, the Duke of Guise's brother intervened, sending a delegation under his client the bishop Jer√¥me Bourgeois to bring the community back into the Catholic fold. His attempt to break up the Protestant service would however end in humiliation, being chased out the meeting house under insult, only increasing the size of the community by the time of their Christmas service. Massacre= Prelude  In the opening months of 1562, France slipped increasingly close to civil war. Conscious of this and anxious to avoid a coalition of German princes in favour of the Huguenot Louis, Prince of Cond√© should war break out, the Duke of Guise met with Christoph, Duke of W√ºrttemberg promising to promote the confession of Augsburg in France in return for the Dukes neutrality. This achieved Guise began the return to Paris to which he had been called on 28 Feb by the Lieutenant-General Antoine of Navarre to aid him in opposing Catherine's Edict of January. Stopping on the way at the family seat of Joinville, his mother Antoinette complained to him about the spread of heresy among their estates and urged him to act against it. Setting out from Joinville with 200 gendarmes the next day, Guise intended to stop next at his estates at √âclaron, passing by Wassy to pick up several reinforcement gendarmes that were mustering in the town. Reaching Brousseval a short distance away he heard the Church bells of Wassy ringing, at a time in the day which occluded the possibility it was for a Catholic service, enraging him. He summoned a council of his leading gentlemen to decide how to proceed, with the hardline faction of Jacque de la Montaigne and Jacque de la Brosse leading the council towards intervening in the town. On the pretext of desiring to hear mass in the town, Guise and his entire gendarme company, entered Wassy by the South gate and headed for the church.  Massacre  Heading towards the church, Guise was further incensed to find that the location of the Protestant meeting house was both so close to the town church and in the Castle district which constituted his property. He entered the church, convening with the towns leading opponents of Protestantism, the priest and provost, who urged him to act and disperse the assembly. Heading out towards the meeting house he sent Gaston de la Brosse out ahead of him with two pages to announce his arrival, inside the barn 500 worshippers sung psalms. Gaston attempted to gain entry to the barn but was resisted by those at the door, overpowering them he began to kill those nearest. The rest of Guise's company now rushed forward, trumpets blaring for the attack, then Guise himself either unwilling or unable to stop what had begun. Many worshippers fled through the hole in the roof, some escaping others picked off by sharpshooters, those who fled down the streets were met by arquebusiers stationed at the cemetery, the pastor Morel was wounded and captured. After an hour the massacre ceased, of the 500 parishioners, 50 lay dead, of whom 5 were women and 1 a child. Aftermath= Word spreads  News of the massacre would quickly spread both around France and internationally, with tracts printed and woodcuts made for the illiterate from England to the Holy Roman Empire. The exact nature of the events, in particular in relation to whether it had been a Huguenot or a member of Guise' party who had begun the violence at the door, immediately became a source of disagreement between Protestant and Catholic polemics and contemporary histories. In the Protestant Histoire des Martyres, it is an act of pre-meditated violence on the part of the Catholic gentlemen who cry upon entering the temple \\"let us kill them all\\". In Guise' recollections to the Duke of W√ºrttemberg, which would form the basis for the Catholic account, he reports that upon trying to inspect the temple he was resisted, and arquebusiers were fired from the inside at his men, who had only swords to defend themselves. The word massacre, which had prior referred in French to the butcher's block and knife, would enter the lexicon with a new meaning.  Further massacre and revolt  The massacre inspired further religious violence in its immediate wake. On 12 April the people of Sens would massacre over 100 of the town's Huguenots, throwing their corpses into the Seine. Further massacres would occur in Castelnaudary and Bar-sur-Seine in early 1562. Huguenots involved in the attempted or successful seizure of towns such as Rouen and Troyes would assert that their actions were necessary to prevent themselves being massacred like the parishioners of Wassy.  Spiral to war  Having committed the massacre, and despite resulting instructions from Catherine to immediately come to court, Guise continued on to Paris, where upon hearing the news of his actions he was given a heroes welcome by the Catholic population. Catherine, as regent, seeing the dangerous potential of the magnates in the city, ordered him and the leader of the Huguenot party, the Prince of Cond√© to vacate Paris, Guise however refused to do so. In response to this and the massacre Cond√© marched on Orl√©ans seizing it on 2 April and several days later releasing a manifesto which in justifying his rebellion would cite the \\"cruel and horrible carnage wrought at Vassy, in the presence of M. de Guise\\". Several days later at the Calvinist Synod of Orleans he would be proclaimed the protector of all Calvinist churches in the Kingdom.  First French war of religion  The major engagements of the war occurred at Rouen, Dreux and Orl√©ans. At the Siege of Rouen (May‚ÄìOctober 1562), the crown regained the city, but Antoine of Navarre died of his wounds. In the Battle of Dreux (December 1562), Cond√© was captured by the Guises, and Montmorency, the governor general, was captured by those opposing the crown. In February 1563, at the Siege of Orl√©ans, Guise was shot and killed by the Huguenot Jean de Poltrot de M√©r√©. As he was killed outside of direct combat, the Guise considered this an assassination on the orders of the duke's enemy, Admiral Coligny. The popular unrest caused by the assassination, coupled with the resistance by the city of Orl√©ans to the siege, led Catherine de' Medici to mediate a truce, resulting in the Edict of Amboise on 19 March 1563. In fiction The massacre is depicted in Ken Follett's 2017 novel A Column of Fire.

Created by head writers Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina and Leah Laiman, he has been portrayed by Stephen Nichols since 1985. Storylines=1985‚Äì1990 Steve served in the Merchant Marines with Bo Brady and they were good friends until they both fell for a woman named Britta. They competed for her, sometimes violently, and went along with her when she asked them to get tattoos. They didn't know that the tattoos were a code for secret bonds she was hiding. As the competition accelerated, Bo and Steve got in a knife fight which ended with Steve losing his eye. They split up and Steve returned to Salem to work for Victor Kiriakis. He was deployed to get a piece of film from Kimberly Brady, but the film found its way to Melissa and Pete Jannings who promptly went on the run when they figured out how dangerous it was. Bo and Hope Brady went off in pursuit, sure that the film would give them the evidence they needed to convict Kiriakis for his crimes. Although Victor and Steve were both arrested, they managed to get free thanks to Victor's blackmailing Larry Welch to taking the blame. Steve's next project went even worse. He held a mysterious man covered in bandages and planned to sell him to Victor. The plan fell through when the man escaped. Things got even uglier for him when Britta walked back into his life. Although they began seeing each other, she wound up injured after someone tried to shoot him and shot her in the crossfire. Once she recovered, she walked out. This left him with the chance to meet and fall in love with Kayla Brady. After they hooked up, he began having disturbing memories and became increasingly distant from her. He soon found himself enmeshed in a host of problems. After he discovered that his sister‚ÄîAdrienne‚Äîkilled their father in self-defense, he decided to shield her and take the blame. All the while she had blocked the incident from her mind, but as the memories returned, she confessed just before he could be sentenced for the crime. Next, Steve got mixed up with Harper Deveraux, helping him to fake his death so that he could escape while battling with Steve's old boss Victor. Learning of the plot, Victor had the blanks in Steve's gun changed for live ones and Harper ended up in a coma after being shot by Steve. Grabbing Kayla, Steve went on the run only to be cleared of the charges while he was away. When he returned to Salem with Kayla, things would take an unexpected turn. He and his sister had recently discovered that Jack Deveraux was their long lost brother. Because Jack was dying at the time they didn't bother him with this fact. At the same time, Kayla became Jack's nurse and he fell madly in love with her. Seeing this, Steve started to push her away so that she could spend her time with Jack and make him happy. This proved effective and Jack married Kayla, but the plan quickly collapsed after that. Steve had discovered that Harper was poisoning Kayla so he kidnapped her to save her life. Although she was already ill, she refused to believe him and ran. This was enough to spark things up between them, however, and they began an affair which they tried to shield from Jack. The affair was publicly exposed in the newspaper. Jack was crushed, raped Kayla and had Steve beaten. Steve went after him and wound up pushing him off a roof. The fall resulted in severe injuries and Jack needed a kidney transplant to live. Since Steve, as his brother, was a match, he agreed to give up a kidney for him, though only at his mother's prompting. The nightmare wasn't over for Kayla though. Harper was on the loose and he kidnapped her and Kimberly when they realized that he was the Riverfront Knifer. Steve saved them, but Kayla was injured in the fallout and suffered from deafness and loss of speech. After a successful surgery, she could hear again and Steve asked her to marry him. They did and her speech returned just in time for her to say 'I do.' The happy couple went off to the Orient for their honeymoon. There they encountered a deaf boy named Benjy. They returned to Salem with the child but his mother soon came after them. She told them that his father was a nasty man but let them look out for him, hoping that they could protect him. She was found dead soon after. The mysterious father turned out to be the nefarious Stefano DiMera but, to ease their burden, Benjy's grandfather, Orion, arrived to take him away to live in secrecy. Danger ended up coming at Steve and Kayla from another source soon after. Harper had escaped prison and kidnapped her once again, but Steve managed to save her and put Harper back in prison. The next year, Steve became mixed up with Nick Corelli after he found his severely burned body. Steve hid Nick while he recovered and had to bring Kayla into the fold to help out. When Nick was sufficiently recovered, he left them but his bad luck followed him. Steve would have to come to his rescue when he needed help trying to get rid of Eddie who was trying to steal his secret fortune. When Eddie was shot in a standoff, Nick gave Steve and Kayla his mansion as a token of his thanks. Later that year, Steve joined the ISA and was sent to track an arsonist who had been torching black churches in the south. His investigation brought him to Saul Taylor's revivalist camp, which just happened to be set up right outside Salem. After undergoing some facial surgery and getting a glass eye, he infiltrated the group under the alias of Brother Daniel Lucas. He soon discovered that Taylor was using the camp as a front for stolen goods and that he was behind many of the bombings which included an explosion that killed his best friend's parents. The investigation ended when Taylor's partner shot him and then went off a cliff during a fight. Returning to focus his attention on Kayla, Steve found that she was expecting a child. Their happiness was complicated by the arrival of Marina Toscano, who claimed to be Steve's wife. While he had indeed married her, he had thought her long since dead, confessing to Kayla that he believed that he'd killed her during a seaboard fight. Marina made it clear that she didn't want Steve back, she just needed his help getting a key that they'd thrown into the sea. Hoping for a quick divorce, he agreed to help her and went to Italy to get the key. While there, he had to fight off Kiriakis' henchmen when they tried to get the key from him. The fight left him with a broken glass eye. Meanwhile, in Salem, Kayla had had enough of Marina putting her husband and family in danger and the pair got in a fight. Later, Marina turned up dead and Kayla became a key suspect. To make things worse, Kiriakis kidnapped her in a bid to get the key. She was released when Isabella gave the key to Victor. The couple then rushed to get married before she gave birth and she was arrested for Marina's murder during the wedding. Kayla stood trial, thanks largely to doctored evidence that Kiriakis had sent to John Black. She was convicted and gave Steve their newborn daughter, Stephanie, to raise. He hired a nanny, Kelly Parker, who, unfortunately, turned out to be quite crazy and kidnapped the child when Kayla escaped from prison. Steve and Kayla went in pursuit of her, tracking her to Australia where they were lucky enough to find Bo and Hope who helped them track her down. After getting Stephanie back, they had the additional good news that Kayla had been cleared of the murder conviction and they all returned to Salem. Unfortunately, Harper Devereaux wasn't finished with the couple and escaped from prison once again for revenge. Harper tried to shoot Steve while he and Kayla were married, but his son, Jack, learning of the plot, stopped him and pushed him from the bell tower from which he took aim. After he plummeted to his death, the wedding continued. Now Steve decided to turn over another leaf in his life and become a police officer. While out on patrol one night, he investigated a boat where he discovered a card from Lawrence Alamain. The boat then promptly blew up and left him severely injured. He went into a coma but recovered. Fearing what he knew, Lawrence had Steve's IV poisoned. When Steve died, Lawrence then had his casket switched before it could be buried and rushed Steve's body off. 2006‚Äì2009 Sixteen years later, Steve reappeared suffering from severe amnesia and calling himself Nick. He was discovered by Jack, who took him back to Salem, shocking Kayla by showing up at Jennifer Horton and Frankie's wedding. He had no idea who she was, but she tried her best to make him remember. After the pair was attacked by a lethal biological agent, they recuperated in the hospital but her recovery was complicated by a reaction to the antidote. Steve faked his memories in a bid to help Kayla recover, giving her the confidence to get better. She soon realized that he'd been faking and distanced herself from him. From then on, he tried hard to take back the life that he'd lost and get her back. It took a lot of effort to convince her that he was his old self again, but they eventually reunited. The reunion was far from smooth, however. In Steve's absence from Salem, he was held by the DiMeras who tortured and brainwashed him into being one of their soldiers. As Steve began to realize this, he tried to resist and to kill the man who was controlling him: Stefano's son, EJ DiMera. This has proved difficult and EJ managed to force Steve into kidnapping John Black‚Äîso that he could steal his kidney‚Äîand in committing other illegal acts. Steve began pushing Kayla away to protect her and went in and out of mental hospitals where he was still at the mercy of EJ and his agents. Later, Steve helped Hope Brady get out of the DiMera house by telling Stefano DiMera that they were having an affair. Stefano believed it and let Steve and Hope leave. Steve has been involved in helping end the vendetta including assisting in faking Stefano's death, but when Andre killed Benjy, Steve lost control. He kidnapped Stefano and demanded Andre bring Roman Brady‚Äîwho Andre had kidnapped‚Äîto the television stations where he was holding Stefano. Andre did as Steve said and released Roman. Realizing Steve was out of his mind with grief, Stefano dropped all charges against Steve for the kidnapping, doing so to honor Benjy's memory. Steve was then kidnapped by his old lover Ava Vitali. Steve and Kayla's baby boy, named Joe, was born prematurely. After Kayla survived being accidentally shot by Hope, she and Steve quietly left town. As of 2014, Steve has rejoined the ISA as an undercover agent, and Kayla has returned to Salem where she serves as a doctor. They are currently estranged. 2015‚Äìpresent In August 2015, Steve abruptly returned to Salem after Joey (now a teenager) showed up on his doorstep, having run away from his boarding school. He resigned from the ISA, rescued Bo from the clutches of an as-yet-unknown group who had captured and tortured Bo as a means of trying to find the secrets behind Dr. Salinas's miracle drug, and returned him to Salem in time to save Hope from a murderous Aiden Jennings. He is currently attempting to heal his relationship with Kayla and his family, and has entered into a partnership with John Black, another ex-ISA agent, to start a new private investigation business, tentatively called \\"Black Patch\\".

The Australian Energy Market Operator used RiverLink in its proposal for this interconnector, but the transmission companies in South Australia (ElectraNet) and New South Wales (TransGrid) now call it EnergyConnect. South Australia and New South Wales already each have connections to Victoria, which also has a connection across Bass Strait to Tasmania, and New South Wales also has connections to Queensland. The proposed connection between New South Wales and South Australia would provide resilience and redundancy to the network. It is aimed to provide increased security of supply to South Australia and better access to renewable energy generation to New South Wales. Construction of the new interconnector is expected to cost . It will be long, from Robertstown to Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. It is proposed to have a spur from Buronga to Red Cliffs in Victoria. Assessment of the Regulatory Investment Test for Transmission (RIT-T) began in June 2019. The link endpoints are at Robertstown in South Australia where major transmission lines connect to the north and south of the state, and Wagga Wagga, the furthest west in New South Wales that the high voltage lines reach. The new high-voltage line is expected to improve the feasibility of more solar and wind farms in the areas traversed by the line. The Australian Energy Market Commission changed its rules in April 2019 to streamline the regulatory process for several network upgrades including Project EnergyConnect. The change allows the Australian Energy Regulator to consider the proposals concurrently. ElectraNet established information hubs near the South Australian part of the route to consult the public about the detailed route. One of the concerns is that the proposed route crosses Calperum Station which is home to a critically endangered species, the black- eared miner. New South Wales put the project on a fast-track development process by assigning it \\"critical infrastructure\\" status.

He played three seasons in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the Detroit Wolverines in 1881 and 1882 and for the Buffalo Bisons in 1883. Derby won 29 games and led the National League in both strikeouts and shutouts as a 24-year-old rookie in 1881. However, after pitching 55 complete games and almost 500 innings in 1881, Derby developed shoulder problems that reduced the velocity of his pitches. His career was cut short, and he played in his final major league game in July 1883 at age 25. Early years Derby was born in Webster, Massachusetts, in 1857. He began his professional baseball career at age 19 in 1877 with the Hornellsville, New York team in the League Alliance. He next played for the Syracuse Stars of the International Association in 1878 and the Washington Nationals of the National Association in 1879 and 1880. In 1880, he compiled a 10‚Äì7 record and a remarkable 0.57 earned run average (ERA) in 158 innings for the Nationals. Major League Baseball=Detroit Wolverines1881 season= Derby signed with the newly formed Detroit Wolverines for the 1881 season. He was described as \\"a compactly built, blonde haired, blue- eyed, pleasant-voiced gentleman who was to do all the pitching, and right well did he do his work.\\" During his rookie season, Derby led the National League in both strikeouts (212) and shutouts (9). He also established a franchise record for the Detroit Wolverines that was never broken with 494-2/3 innings pitched in 1881; Derby started 55 games for Detroit, all complete games, and also had one relief appearance. The Detroit Free Press described Derby's rise to stardom in the first part of the 1881 season: > \\"His speed was moderate, but he was the master of all the crooks and curves > that can be imparted to the aerial projectiles. In obedience to his will, > the ball twisted out or in, up or down. He held batsmen at his mercy to a > degree equalled by no other pitcher. He was the wizard of the pitcher's box, > and within a month George H. Derby had risen from obscurity to fame in base > ball circles.\\" He finished the 1881 season with a 29‚Äì26 record, a 2.20 earned run average (ERA), and an Adjusted ERA+ of 131. However, late in the 1881 season, Derby's dominance waned, and opposing teams began hitting him more freely. When the Detroit team included him on its reserve list at the end of the 1881 season, some questioned the decision. The Detroit Free Press noted that there were suspicions that Derby's decline had been intentional: > \\"For three months [Derby and Bennett] formed the most effective battery in > the League, playing game after game without error. Wild pitches, wild > throws, and passed balls were almost unknown to them. Then they began to > make errors . . . In plain words, they both, for some incomprehensible > reason, began playing badly . . . Suspicion was common, and it sometimes > found a voice, that Detroit's famous battery were 'playing for a release.'\\" It was revealed the next year that Derby had begun experiencing shoulder problems late in the 1881 season. Derby complained that he had been unable to \\"give force to the ball\\" and therefore pitched fewer games in August and September 1881. =1882 season= In 1882, Derby proved fairly effective in the beginning of the season, but his velocity was off. In 1881, Derby had relied on the combination of speed and deceptive delivery. Without the speed, \\"batters had got accustomed to slow curve pitching, [and] he was hit freely and heavily.\\" Derby started 39 games and pitched 362 innings in 1882 (down from 55 and 494 the year before) and compiled a 17-20 record. His ERA jumped by more than a point from 2.20 in 1881 to 3.26 in 1882. On September 14, 1882, the Detroit team suspended Derby for playing poorly. The Detroit Free Press wrote that Derby's star had sunk \\"beneath the base ball horizon\\" but questioned the fairness of a suspension: \\"If he [played poorly] intentionally, the sentence is just; if not, it is severe in the extreme. . . . He was wild in his delivery and had so little speed that the batters experienced little difficulty in hitting balls that came across the plate.\\" Buffalo Bisons In October 1882, the Buffalo Bisons announced that Derby would join their team in 1883. Derby's performance in 1883 at Buffalo continued the slide. He started only 13 games for Buffalo and compiled a 2-10 record with a 5.85 ERA. He appeared in his final major league game on July 3, 1883, at age 25. Career statistics Over his three major league seasons, Derby compiled a 48‚Äì56 record in 110 appearances, with a 3.01 ERA and 428 strikeouts. Later years Derby died in Philadelphia at the age of 67. He was buried at Wellsboro Cemetery in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania.

Pothigai hills is a highly divine and spiritual center. There is a story that when Shiva and Parvati entered into divine matrimony at Mount Kailash in the north, the place was unbalanced because of the multitude of holy beings witnessing the wedding. Lord Shiva asked Agastya Maharishi to proceed to southern India to balance the world. Agastya Maharishi then proceeded to Pothigai hills and balanced the world. Agastya Maharishi was able to visualise the wedding of Lord Shiva and Parvati on a Shivalingam that was at Tiru Kalyana Teertham at Pothigai hills. These hills are visited by several saints and sages from Himalayas particularly on a full moon day. The striking similarity between the profiles of Mt.

It also uses the unofficial name . Saga Airport is located on the edge of the Ariake Sea, in what is best called a polder, 35 minutes from JR Saga Station by bus. History Spring Airlines check-in counter in Saga Airport The governor of Saga Prefecture announced the construction of Saga Airport in January 1969, and after years of studies and negotiations, construction commenced in 1992. https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/ The airport opened in July 1998, with hours initially limited to 8.30 a.m. to 8 p.m. At the airport's outset, All Nippon Airways operated flights to Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya and Japan Air System operated a daily flight to Osaka. JAS suspended service to Osaka in September 2001; ANA suspended service to Nagoya in February 2003 and to Osaka in January 2011. Due to the slump in mainline service to the airport, Saga Prefecture began several programs aimed at promoting usage of the airport, including ground transportation subsidies for local companies that used the airport for business travel. By fiscal year 2011 these subsidies totaled 4.2 billion yen, while landing fees payable to the prefecture had been slashed to one-third of their original level. The prefectural government also embarked on a promotional effort targeting foreign low-cost carriers. In 2004, the airport's hours were extended to allow service between midnight and 4 a.m., and ANA began overnight cargo service between Saga and Tokyo, initially using passenger aircraft but switching to Boeing 767 freighter aircraft in 2006. The flight is used by overnight delivery services to send parcels to and from destinations in Kyushu. The airport accommodated 313,200 outbound domestic passengers in 2012. It has also accommodated charter flights to a number of domestic and international destinations in the past, although the only such flights during fiscal year 2012 were Spring Airlines \\"program charter\\" flights to Shanghai, China. Construction commenced on new facilities for international passengers in March 2013; these facilities are to be completed by December 2013. Saga was a candidate destination to receive an additional pair of Haneda Airport slots in November 2013, but its bid was rejected by the government due to its existing four-daily service and its proximity to Fukuoka Airport. The airport adopted the name \\"Kyushu Saga International Airport\\" in January 2016 in order to improve its appeal to foreign airlines, particularly Asian low- cost carriers, as a gateway to other destinations in Kyushu. The prefectural government's 10-year plan calls for adding flights to Hong Kong, Taipei and Southeast Asia, doubling the terminal capacity to two domestic and two international gates, increasing parking and check-in space, and potentially extending the main runway to 2,500 m.

Seiko Epson has also used the airport for weekly employee charter flights to and from Matsumoto since 1997. In December 2012, an ANA flight landing from Tokyo overran the runway at Shonai. There were no fatalities, but the airport was closed for the following day.

The square is dominated by the Volksb√ºhne and by the Karl-Liebknecht-Haus, the headquarters of the German Left Party. The party's predecessor, the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), opened its headquarters on the square in 1926. The square was previously named Babelsberger Platz (1907-1910) and B√ºlowplatz (1910-1933), and was the focus of one of the last mass demonstrations in Berlin against the Nazi Party on January 25, 1933‚Äîfive days before Adolf Hitler was appointed German Chancellor. Later that year, with the rise of the Third Reich, it was renamed Horst-Wessel-Platz (1933-1945) after National Socialist martyr Horst Wessel. Following the fall of Berlin and Soviet occupation, the square, then part of communist-controlled East Berlin, was renamed Liebknechtplatz (1945-1947) after German communist Karl Liebknecht. It was then renamed Luxemburgplatz (1947-1969) after communist leader Rosa Luxemburg, until it was given the name Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz by the East German regime in 1969. German policemen lay a wreath on the monument to Captains Anlauf and Lenck during the Day of the German Police, January 16, 1937. In 1951, Erich Mielke, one of the murderers, ordered the demolition of the monument. The square is noted as the scene of the murders of Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck, police captains who were the victims of a double homicide in 1931 at the hands of members of the KPD. A monument created by Hans Dammann commemorating Anlauf and Lenck was erected in the square in 1934; although a metal statue of Anlauf and Lenck was melted down during the Second World War as part of a metal recycling campaign (\\"Metallspende des deutschen Volkes\\"), the rest of the monument was destroyed in 1950 on the orders of Erich Mielke, one of the murderers, who was by then a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and a State Secretary in the newly formed Ministry of State Security.Michael Stricker: Letzter Einsatz.

Construction Joseph Ridges, designer and builder of the original Salt Lake Tabernacle organ, and William H. Folsom, Young's father-in-law, worked together to draw the plans and superintend the construction. Folsom, who had been LDS Church Architect from 1861 to 1867, had played a vital role in the design and construction of the Salt Lake Theatre, Salt Lake Tabernacle, St. George Tabernacle, Salt Lake Temple, Manti Temple, St. George Temple, and many private residences. He was also the father of Harriet Amelia Folsom Young. Located in Salt Lake City at 70 E. South Temple,Legal description: East half of Lot 6, Block 75, Plat A the structure was built to the south of Brigham Young's Beehive House, and directly east of the 1855 LDS Church historian's office. Construction began in 1873; after completion, it was dedicated on February 22, 1883. The finished home had four levels, including the basement, with a tower on the northwest corner. The foundation and basement were made of granite. The exterior walls were of 2 x 6 studs infilled with adobe bricks, with lath and plaster on the inside and two layers of lath and stucco on the outside. The interior woodwork, which included a spiral staircase, paneling, and decorative trim, was carved in black walnut by local artists. Elegant furnishings, paintings by local artists, and mirrors imported from Europe graced all the rooms.Levi Edgar Young, \\"Historic Buildings of Salt Lake City,\\" Young Women's Journal 6 (1922): 309-11. Several writers estimated that the church expended between $30,000 and $50,000 to finish the building and furnish its interior. Wilford Woodruff estimated the cost at $15,000.Wilford Woodruff, Wilford Woodruff's Journal, 1833-1898, 9 vols. (Salt Lake City, Signature Books, 1989), January 2, 1882 entryJournal History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, September 2, 1873, gives the dimensions of the house. The Salt Lake Tribune claimed that Ralph Ramsay, a famous Utah woodcarver, did some of the woodwork in the Gardo.The Salt Lake Tribune, February 3, 1957. Ramsay had done woodwork in the Beehive House and Lion House and had carved the eagle on the original Eagle Gate. However, he moved from Salt Lake City to Richfield in 1874, which may have precluded him from working on the Gardo House. In addition, it has been noted that the style of the woodwork in the Gardo was dissimilar to known examples of Ramsay's work.  History  During the last years of his life, Brigham Young perceived a need for a place where he could receive official callers and entertain the dignitaries who traveled great distances to see him. This idea goes as far back as the Nauvoo Era, in which Joseph Smith proposed a similar idea under the name of the Mansion House. The Mansion House was to act as a place for travelers to come and stay in Nauvoo with hospitality in mind. Young was fond of naming his homes; one source claims that he borrowed the name Gardo from a favorite Spanish novel.Susa Young Gates, \\"The Gardo House,\\" Improvement Era 20 (1917): 1099-1103Journal History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, September 2, 1873 (microfilm, LDS Church Historical Department, Salt Lake City)Clarissa Young Spencer and Mabel Harmer, Brigham Young at Home (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1972), 219-21.Other accounts say that the house was called \\"Gardo\\" because it seemed to stand \\"guard\\" over the city. Progress on the mansion was slow. There were numerous delays in obtaining the necessary lumber, plaster, granite and glass.George Reynolds, Salt Lake City, June 6, 1876, to Brigham Young, Letter Books, Brigham Young Papers, LDS Church Archives, Salt Lake City, Utah. Young, who was often away on church business, was seldom available to sign requisitions or make important decisions. However, on one occasion, after returning to Salt Lake City from a visit to St. George, he expressed displeasure with the style of the home, calling it his \\"tabernacle organ.\\"Joseph Heinerman, \\"Amelia's Palace,\\" Montana: The Magazine of Western History 29 (1979): 54-63. The mansion was dedicated on February 22, 1883. After three years of construction, the Gardo House was nearing completion when an unfortunate accident occurred near Arsenal Hill (now Capitol Hill), a repository for gunpowder and explosives. On April 5, 1876, two young hunters fired their guns into one of the powder magazines. The resulting explosion showered the city with 500 tons of boulders, concrete, and pebbles. Many persons were injured; some, including the hunters, were killed.Melvin L. Bashore, \\"The 1876 Arsenal Hill Explosion,\\" Utah Historical Quarterly 52 (1984): 247-49; Salt Lake Herald, April 6, 1876. The explosion also broke several of the glass windows in the Gardo House, and new glass had to be ordered from the East. By May 20 the windows were reinstalled and construction had resumed.George Reynolds, Salt Lake City, May 20, 1876, to Brigham Young, Letter Books, Brigham Young Papers. Brigham Young never lived to see the completed mansion; he died on August 29, 1877. The settlement of Young's estate was divided into three parts: church properties in Young's name, properties belonging to his private estate, and properties where legal ownership was unknown. In his will, Young had provided both Mary Ann Angell Young and Harriet Amelia Folsom Young a life tenancy in the Gardo House, and in order to secure their claims, the two women occupied the mansion briefly while it was still under construction. Although the legal ownership of the mansion was in question, the settlement credited it to Young's heirs instead of to the church, at the highly inflated figure of $120,000. Of this sum, approximately $20,000 was paid to Mary Ann Angell Young and Harriet Amelia Folsom Young.Leonard J. Arrington, \\"The Settlement of Brigham Young's Estate, 1877-1879,\\" in Pacific Historical Review 21(1952): 11-13. According to Arrington, it was discovered during probate of the estate that Young owed one million dollars to the church. One of the credits the church granted the estate against this indebtedness was a $120,000 credit for the Gardo House.Interview by Sandra Dawn Brimhall with Dr. Dee L. Folsom, Salt Lake City, Utah, September 23, 1990; notes in Ms. Brimhall's possession. Harriet Amelia Folsom Young resided the rest of her life at a house at 1st West and South Temple. She never remarried. She is buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. John Taylor succeeded Young as church president. His counselor George Q. Cannon and other church leaders suggested that Taylor occupy the Gardo House after its completion, but he repeatedly refused. However, when church members unanimously voted on April 9, 1879, to make the Gardo House the official parsonage for LDS Church presidents, Taylor reluctantly accepted their decision.Brigham H. Roberts, The Life of John Taylor: Third President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon & Sons Co., 1892), 331. Moses Thatcher, William Jennings, and Angus M. Cannon were appointed as a committee to oversee completion of the mansion.Journal History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, December 27, 1881 On December 27, 1881, the Deseret News published a letter from John Taylor announcing a public reception and tour of the Gardo House on January 2, 1882, from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. More than two thousand people attended the reception and toured the home. Taylor greeted all the visitors, who were entertained by two bands and several renditions by the Tabernacle Choir. An early visitor to the mansion was Oscar Wilde, whom Taylor introduced to the residence while showing Wilde around Salt Lake on April 10, 1882. Wilde spoke well of the house saying it \\"had a good deal of feeling in it in the pleasing works of art and good furniture.\\" \\"Art and Aesthetics\\", interview with Wilde, Denver Tribune, April 13, 1882. A year later, on February 22, 1883, the mansion was dedicated as a \\"House unto the Lord\\" in a dedicatory prayer offered by Apostle Franklin D. Richards.Journal History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, January 3, 1882. Moses Thatcher, William Jennings, Angus M. Cannon, and their wives were particularly noted as being among the guests. Also noted were Joseph F. Smith, Franklin D. Richards, Francis M. Lyman, John H. Smith, and Daniel H. Wells.Matthias F. Cowley, ed., Wilford Woodruff: History of His Life and Labors (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1964), 545. By the time John Taylor became church president, the Edmunds- Tucker Act was putting intense pressure on him to observe this anti-bigamy law. He sought to comply with the law by moving into the Gardo House with his sister, Agnes Taylor. She took over management of the mansion while he continued his duties as president. The Victorian mansion was demolished on November 26, 1921.  Controversy = \\"Amelia's Palace\\"  There were widespread rumors that the Gardo House was built for Harriet Amelia Folsom Young; allegedly she was Brigham Young's favorite wife. It was indeed Young's intent that Amelia would act as the official hostess for the building. According to his daughter Susa Young Gates, family members agreed that Amelia, who was young, childless, mannerly, and talented, was well suited to assume such a responsibility.Susa Young Gates, The Life Story of Brigham Young (New York: Macmillan Company, 1930), 350-53.l Since the Gardo House's intent was to welcome visitors to and also to promote a positive perception of the Latter- day Saints. Thus the claim that the house was built solely for Amelia's pleasure, as an act of favoritism, is a misinterpretation, when it was actually a specific calling for her upon which the family apparently agreed. Since Harriet Folsom Young's father was the chief architect it is reasonable to insist that there was extra attention given to the detail of the home by her father, though this would be the act of a loving father and not Brigham Young.  John Taylor  John Taylor succeeded Young as church president. His counselor George Q. Cannon and other church leaders suggested that Taylor occupy the Gardo House after its completion, but he repeatedly refused. However, when church members unanimously voted on April 9, 1879, to make the Gardo House the official parsonage for LDS church presidents, President Taylor reluctantly accepted their decision.Brigham H. Roberts, The Life of John Taylor: Third President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon & Sons Co., 1892), 331. Some believed that the Gardo House was built too extravagantly for church leaders to live in, considering the persecutions and generally humble origins of the church. In March 1885, soon after John Taylor's final public appearance, federal marshals made a massive raid on the mansion to capture him. This and subsequent raids were unsuccessful, and his \\"tough-minded sister ... often held raiding marshals and deputies at bay at the front door of the mansion, admitting no one unless he presented papers properly signed by a federal judge.\\" After her brother's 1887 death, Taylor vacated the house.\\"Letter from Wilford Woodruff to Agnes T. Schwartz.\\" August 20, 1887 First Presidency Letterpress Copy Books. 1887‚ÄîAugust‚ÄìSeptember. Rachel Emma Woolley Simmons recorded in her journal her personal discontent not with John Taylor moving into the home but citing the \\"... great expense to furnish it in the style it had to be ...\\". She also believed that Taylor was not pleased with moving or were his wives.Kate B. Carter, ed., \\"Journal of Rachel Emma Woolley Simmons,\\" in Heart Throbs of the West, 12 vols. (Salt Lake City: Daughters of Utah Pioneers, 1939-51), 11:179. \\"Brother John Taylor gives a reception in the Gardo House. ... I have no fault to find with him for moving into that house, but I think it would have been more becoming if he had stayed in his own home. It was a great expense to furnish it in the style it had to be. ... I don't believe he is enjoying it much. I heard that his wives were not pleased with the move\\" The Salt Lake Daily Tribune was extremely critical of the affair and of the church in general. In an editorial published the day before the reception, the newspaper wrote, \\" The favored saints have received an invitation to call upon President John Taylor at the Amelia Palace tomorrow. ... We want the poor Mormons ... to mark the carpets, mirrors, the curtains and the rest, and then to go home and look at the squalor of their own homes, their unkempt wives, their miserable children growing up in despair and ignorance, and then to reflect how much better it would have been for them, instead of working hard for wages ... if they had only started out as did Uncle John, determined to serve God for nothing but hash.\\" The Tribune went on to accuse the church of attempting \\"to build up an aristocracy in Utah, where the few are to rule in luxury, while the many, to support the luxury, are to toil and suffer.\\"Salt Lake Daily Tribune, January 1, 1882. On January 5, 1882, the Deseret News published a rebuttal to the Tribune's scathing editorial. The newspaper pointed out Taylor had taken up his residence in the Gardo House in response to the vote of the Mormon people and that he, as church president, should be taken care of considering the adversity which he personally endured, he was with Joseph Smith the day he was killed back in 1844, and hoped to do so at a level that those in \\"Church and State elsewhere\\" were.The Deseret News, January 5, 1882. \\"[He should] be at least as well housed and cared for as prominent men in Church or State here or elsewhere. ... We are pleased to see that one of the veterans of the latter-day work, who has traveled from land to land and from sea to sea, who has suffered with the exiles and bled with the martyrs, forsaken all things for the truth ... is now surrounded with comfort, and has a place to lay his head and to receive his friends.\\" Taylor himself also wrote a letter, published in the Deseret News, expressing his feelings about the situation. He reminded critics of his initial reluctance to move to the Gardo House and his concern that his occupancy of the mansion would place an intolerable barrier between him and church members. Taylor acknowledged that his family had also been opposed to the move, preferring their own homes and familiar surroundings. He explained he had eventually been persuaded that \\"Zion should become the praise of the whole earth, and that we in this land should take a prominent and leading part in the arts, sciences, architecture, literature, and in everything that would tend to ... exalt and ennoble Zion. [It is the president's duty] to take the lead in everything that is calculated to ... place Zion where she ought to be, first and foremost among the peoples.\\" Both newspapers were correct in implying that the issue of the Gardo House was much broader than the mere occupation of the mansion by a Mormon leader. To Mormons, who had celebrated their church's jubilee in April 1880, the house was a symbol of achievement. It was tangible proof that the persecutions and hardships they had endured over the past fifty years were not in vain.Deseret News, January 5, 1882. On the other hand, many non-Mormons viewed Taylor's installation in the home as a threat in the continuing struggle for economic and political supremacy. Prophecy John Taylor's move to the Gardo House was regarded by some Mormons as the fulfillment of a prophecy. Legend had it that some years before, when Taylor's financial circumstances had been the poorest, Heber C. Kimball had boldly prophesied that Taylor would someday live in the largest and finest mansion in Salt Lake City.Roberts, Life of John Taylor, 331.

Malang Regency is the second largest regency in East Java after Banyuwangi Regency, with a total area of 3,534.86 km¬≤. Malang is rich in potential for agriculture, medicinal plants and tourism. It had a population of about 2,446,218 people (2010 census). This census did not include the areas and populations of the two autonomous cities of Malang and Batu which lie within the regency, but are administratively independent. The capital of the regency is Kepanjen. Most of the population resides in the Greater Malang (Malang Raya) area, a metropolitan area that includes the cities of Malang and Batu and 15 other districts within the regency in a valley between the two cities. The distance between Malang and Batu is approximately 20 km. This metropolitan area covers 1,200.43 km¬≤; it has a population of 2,325,109 (2010 census), with a density of 1,936.9/km¬≤ (5,016/sq mile).The Malang Regency is not completely metropolitan, but only the 15 kecamatan close to Malang are metropolitan, despite that claim in the Wikipedia Indonesian page - see reference under List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia.  History  Historical and archaeological records from Hindu temples suggest that the Kanjuruhan Kingdom emerged in the region during the 8th and 9th Centuries. An inscription on the Dinoyo shrine at Badhut places the shrine's inauguration on Friday, Legi 1st, Margasirsa 682 Saka in the Javanese calendar or November 28, 760 AD. The date is celebrated as an anniversary for Malang. At one time, the Kanjuruhan kingdom was under the leadership of Akuwu Singhasari Ametung, who was married to Ken Dedes. At that time the Kingdom was under the rule of the Kingdom of Kediri, and the Singhasari Government Center was in Tumapel. Only after Ken Arok killed Akuwu Ametung and married Ken Dedes did the centre of control move to the Malang Kingdom, and this only after defeating the Kingdom of Kediri. Kediri at that time fell into the hands of Singhasari. During its peak, the Mataram Kingdom fell into the hands of Mataram, as well as the Kingdom of Majapahit. The government moved to Demak as Islam was introduced, brought by the Wali Songo. The government was then under the reign of Duke Ronggo Tohjiwo. In the time of the collapse, according to folklore, legendary heroes appeared against Raden Panji Pulongjiwo. He was caught by Mataram soldiers in the village now called Kepanjen Panggungrejo (Kepanji's). The destruction of the town was known as Malang Kutho Bedhah. In the era of the Dutch East India Company, Malang was a base for the Trunojoyo resistance (1674-1680) against the Company-assisted Mataram. In the early nineteenth century, the government was headed by the Governor-General. The first Malang Regent was Raden Tumenggung Notodiningrat. He was elected by the Dutch government by resolution of the Governor-General on May 9, 1820. Since 1984, Malang Regency Hall has had a traditional ceremony, of the time from the Kanjuruhan Kingdom, wherein attendees are encouraged to wear traditional costumes of Malang.

It took place in Washington, D.C. on October 6, 1943, three days before Yom Kippur. It was organized by Hillel Kook, nephew of the chief rabbi of Mandatory Palestine and head of the Bergson Group, and involved more than 400 rabbis, mostly members of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada,The Silver Era in American Jewish Orthodoxy: Rabbi Eliezer Silver and his Generation from New York and cities throughout the Eastern United States. It was the only such protest in Washington during the Holocaust. The rabbis were received at steps of the Capitol by the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the Speaker of the House. After prayers for the war effort at the Lincoln Memorial the rabbis marched to the White House to plead with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were informed that the President was busy all day and were instead received by Vice President Henry Wallace. It was later learned that Roosevelt had several free hours that afternoon, but had avoided meeting the delegation out of concern regarding diplomatic neutrality and on the advice of some of his Jewish aides and several prominent American Jews, many of whom thought the protest would stir up anti-Semitism. Both Stephen Wise (head of the World Jewish Congress) and Samuel Rosenman (the President's advisor, speech writer and head of the American Jewish Committee) claimed that the protesting rabbis, many of whom were both Orthodox as well as recent immigrants (or first- generation Americans), \\"were not representative of American Jewry\\" and not the kind of Jews he should meet. In the November 1943 issue of his journal Opinion, Wise referred to the march as a \\"painful and even lamentable exhibition\\", calling it \\"propaganda by stunts\\" and accused the rabbis of offending the dignity of the Jewish people.\\"Propaganda By Stunts\\" (editorial), Opinion, November 1943, p. 4.https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/1943-hundreds-of- rabbis-march-on-washington-1.5446138 Disappointed and angered by the President's failure to meet with them, the rabbis stood in front of the White House where they were met by Senator William Warren Barbour and others, and refused to read their petition aloud, instead handing it off to the Presidential secretary, Marvin McIntyre. The march garnered much media attention, much of it focused on what was seen as the cold and insulting dismissal of many important community leaders, as well as the people in Europe they were fighting for. The headline in the Washington Times Herald read: \\"Rabbis Report 'Cold Welcome' at the White House.\\" Editors of The Jewish Daily Forward commented, \\"Would a similar delegation of 500 Catholic priests have been thus treated?\\" Participants Participating rabbis included the leading rabbinical figures of the era, including Rabbi Eliezer Silver and Rabbi Avraham Kalmanowitz of the Vaad Hatzalah. One of the participants was Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who become one of the most important and famous American Orthodox rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer Poupko, a prominent figure in the orthodox rabbinic world. Holocaust museum petitions On 29 July 2007, relatives of the rabbis who marched on Washington sent a letter to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, urging the inclusion of information about the Bergson Group and the Rabbi's March in the museum's permanent exhibit. A similar petition, signed by 100 public figures, was delivered to Yad Vashem. ReferencesSources * David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies. The Day the Rabbis Marched * Jewish Virtual Library.

His name suggests a connection with Bury St. Edmunds Abbey in Suffolk, but there is no direct evidence.Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 212. He was the chaplain of Hugh of Evesham, another Englishman, from the diocese of Worcester, who in 1282 was made Presbyter-Cardinal of St Laurence in Lucina by Pope Martin IV.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 238. After Hervey de Dundee, bishop-elect of Caithness, died while seeking confirmation at the Roman curia, the pope chose Alan - still in Rome - for the bishopric. Alan was provided by Pope Martin on 13 April 1282.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 59. For the remainder of the 1280s his activities are largely obscure. After the death of King Alexander III of Scotland, Alan was one of the figures who pushed for a marriage between Alexander's granddaughter and heiress Margaret, Maid of Norway and Edward of Caernarfon, heir to King Edward I of England.Ross-Harper, Notable Bishops, p. 10. He was one of the three men appointed to negotiate the marriage, the other two being Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, and John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch.Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 211. Although the deal was made, Margaret's death in 1290 put an end to this plan, and the ensuing succession debate was mediated by King Edward, now temporary ruler of Scotland. King Edward showed his fellow Englishman Alan favour, and on 12 June 1291, appointed him Chancellor of Scotland and handed over to him the Seal of Regency. Edward provided one of his own clerks, Walter de Agsmundesham, as an assistant, and ordered the Chamberlain Alexander de Balliol to pay every month to Bishop Alan 20 merks and to Agsmundesham 10 merks. On 26 October Edward ordered that 40 pieces of oak be provided to Alan from the forest of Ternaway in Moray to be used in Dornoch Cathedral.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 239. Bishop Alan, however, was dead by 12 December, and is last attested on 5 November.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 239; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 59. King Edward, in honour of Alan's services, ordered that all Alan's bona et catalla, goods and chattels, which Edward was entitled to by Scottish custom, be delivered to the Prior of Coldingham - Henry de Horncastre - and to Alan's brother Adam de St Edmund, who was parson of the church of Restalrig.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 239; Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 212.

Elliott Hughes took Phil's terminal emulation and used it as a base upon which he could experiment with advanced terminal emulator features and continues to actively develop Terminator. Martin Dorey ported Terminator to Cygwin.  Features  *Automatic Logging - Complete logs are automatically generated of all of the user's terminal sessions. * Drag & Drop - Text and URLs, and even files from Finder/Nautilus/Windows Explorer can be dropped on Terminator to be inserted as text, with automatic quoting of filenames containing shell meta-characters. * Find - Terminator provides you with a find function so users can search for text and regular expressions within their terminal (including the scrollback) in the style of less, and offering quick movement to the next or previous match. * Horizontal Scrolling - Most terminal emulators wrap text when it intrudes upon the right margin. Terminator instead provides a horizontal scrollbar when necessary. * Multiple Tabs - Like tabbed browsing, only with terminals, tabbed terminals. * Number Reinterpretation - Terminator will recognize numbers in a variety of bases as the current selection, and add informational menu items to the pop-up menu showing the same number in other bases. No more man ascii or resorting to bc. * Portability - Written mostly in Java, with a small POSIX C++ part (for pseudo-terminal support) and a Ruby invocation script, Terminator should compile out of the box on most modern desktop operating systems. * Tab Character Handling - Many terminal emulators translate tab characters into strings of spaces. If a section of text is then copied or pasted from the terminal into a text editor, it appears as spaces rather than tabs; Terminator remembers them as tab characters. * Unlimited Scrollback - Terminator does not throw away output when it scrolls off the top of the screen, nor when it reaches any arbitrary limit. The user must manually clear the scrollback. * Intelligent Vertical Scrolling - Terminator's scrollbar won't keep jumping when there's output if you've deliberately scrolled back to look at part of the history, but as soon as you scroll back to the bottom again, it will resume auto-scrolling. * Safe Quit - Terminator knows when you still have processes running, and brings up a dialog rather than just letting those processes die. * UTF-8 - Terminator does not mangle accented characters, and it copes well with languages such as Greek where there's a mix of normal and wide glyphs.

Early career, 1962‚Äì1965 Born in Mapperley, Nottinghamshire, Rowberry entered the Newcastle-upon-Tyne blues and jazz music scene in the early 1960s, when he was at Newcastle University. He joined The Mike Cotton Jazzmen (later The Mike Cotton Sound) in 1962, who made a living backing American blues and pop acts touring England, including Solomon Burke, Stevie Wonder, the Four Tops and Gene Pitney.Bruce Eder, Biography of the Mike Cotton Sound; Allmusic. Retrieved 2017-03-10.Pierre Perrone, Dave Rowberry Obituary; The Independent, June 8, 2003. Retrieved 2017-03-114. Rowberry played on the group's singles from 1962‚Äì1965, including their hit, \\"Swing That Hammer\\", as well as their self-titled album. The Animals, 1965‚Äì1966 The Animals were already one of the major British Invasion groups in May 1965 when founding keyboardist Alan Price suddenly left due to fear of flying and other issues. According to lead singer Eric Burdon, Rowberry, while considered a good musician, was chosen partly because of his passing physical resemblance to Price. Keyboardist Zoot Money, who became a full-time member of a later configuration of the band, claims that he was approached first, and Rowberry only selected as a second choice. Rowberry played many of the group's big hits, including \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\", \\"It's My Life\\", \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\", \\"Inside-Looking Out\\", and \\"See See Rider\\". For a number of songs, including the last of these, Rowberry was credited as the arranger. He was prominent on Animalisms and Animalization, often considered two of the most consistent albums of the group's recording career. He also sang backing vocals and did occasional songwriting for the group. After The Animals, 1966‚Äì1999 The original incarnation of The Animals collapsed in September 1966, after which Rowberry became a session musician. Until 2001, he was not invited to participate in any subsequent group reunions involving Eric Burdon. He did reunite a few times on projects with his former bandmates from the Mike Cotton Sound. The most notable reunion was The Kinks' album, Everybody's in Show-Biz. Rowberry played on the single \\"Celluloid Heroes\\" and some keyboard instruments on the album. He also appeared with the Kinks on television during this time on the song, \\"Supersonic Rocket Ship\\". Rowberry also played on many albums by blues singer Dana Gillespie in the 1980s and 1990s. When the first incarnation Animals reformed in December 1968 and 1976, Rowberry was excluded, in favour of Price. When a second keyboardist was added to the original group's third reunion in 1983 to early 1984, it was Zoot Money, rather than Rowberry, who was chosen. When The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, only the original five members were honored. Despite attempts by some fans to have Rowberry, as well as drummer Barry Jenkins, another later member of the \\"first\\" lineup, inducted with the other members, their efforts were unsuccessful. Rowberry was present at the May 2001 reunion concert on Burdon's birthday, along with John Steel and Hilton Valentine.

Pervious concrete is made using large aggregates with little to no fine aggregates. The concrete paste then coats the aggregates and allows water to pass through the concrete slab. Pervious concrete is traditionally used in parking areas, areas with light traffic, residential streets, pedestrian walkways, and greenhouses. Report No. 522R-10. It is an important application for sustainable construction and is one of many low impact development techniques used by builders to protect water quality.  History  Pervious concrete was first used in the 1800s in Europe as pavement surfacing and load bearing walls. Cost efficiency was the main motive due to a decreased amount of cement. It became popular again in the 1920s for two storey homes in Scotland and England. It became increasingly viable in Europe after WWII due to the scarcity of cement. It did not become as popular in the US until the 1970s. In India it became popular in 2000.  Stormwater management  The proper utilization of pervious concrete is a recognized Best Management Practice by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for providing first flush pollution control and stormwater management.\\"Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet: Porous Pavement.\\" United States Environmental Protection Agency, EPA 832-F-99-023, September 1999. As regulations further limit stormwater runoff, it is becoming more expensive for property owners to develop real estate, due to the size and expense of the necessary drainage systems. Pervious concrete lowers the sites SCS Curve Number by retaining stormwater on site. This allows the planner/designer to achieve pre-development stormwater goals for pavement intense projects. Pervious concrete reduces the runoff from paved areas, which reduces the need for separate stormwater retention ponds and allows the use of smaller capacity storm sewers. This allows property owners to develop a larger area of available property at a lower cost. Pervious concrete also naturally filters storm water and can reduce pollutant loads entering into streams, ponds and rivers. Pervious concrete functions like a storm water infiltration basin and allows the storm water to infiltrate the soil over a large area, thus facilitating recharge of precious groundwater supplies locally. All of these benefits lead to more effective land use. Pervious concrete can also reduce the impact of development on trees. A pervious concrete pavement allows the transfer of both water and air to root systems allowing trees to flourish even in highly developed areas.  Properties  Pervious concrete consists of cement, coarse aggregate (size should be 9.5 mm to 12.5 mm) and water with little to no fine aggregates. The addition of a small amount of sand will increase the strength. The mixture has a water-to-cement ratio of 0.28 to 0.40 with a void content of 15 to 25 percent. The correct quantity of water in the concrete is critical. A low water to cement ratio will increase the strength of the concrete, but too little water may cause surface failure. A proper water content gives the mixture a wet-metallic appearance. As this concrete is sensitive to water content, the mixture should be field checked. Entrained air may be measured by a Rapid Air system, where the concrete is stained black and sections are analyzed under a microscope. A common flatwork form has riser strips on top such that the screed is 3/8-1/2 in. (9 to 12 mm) above final pavement elevation. Mechanical screeds are preferable to manual. The riser strips are removed to guide compaction. Immediately after screeding, the concrete is compacted to improve the bond and smooth the surface. Excessive compaction of pervious concrete results in higher compressive strength, but lower porosity (and thus lower permeability). Jointing varies little from other concrete slabs. Joints are tooled with a rolling jointing tool prior to curing or saw cut after curing. Curing consists of covering concrete with 6 mil. plastic sheeting within 20 minutes of concrete discharge. However, this contributes to a substantial amount of waste sent to landfills. Alternatively, preconditioned absorptive lightweight aggregate as well as internal curing admixture (ICA) have been used to effectively cure pervious concrete without waste generation.Kevern, J.T. and Farney, C. ‚ÄúReducing Curing Requirements for Pervious Concrete Using a Superabsorbent Polymer for Internal Curing.‚Äù Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board (TRB), Construction 2012, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington D.C.  Testing and inspection  Pervious concrete has a common strength of though strengths up to can be reached. There is no standardized test for compressive strength.\\"Specification for Pervious Concrete.\\" ACI 522.1-08. American Concrete Institute, Farmington Hills, MI, 7pp. Acceptance is based on the unit weight of a sample of poured concrete using ASTM standard no. C1688.ASTM International. \\"Standard Test Method for Density and Void Content of Freshly Mixed Pervious Concrete.\\" Standard No. C1688. An acceptable tolerance for the density is plus or minus of the design density. Slump and air content tests are not applicable to pervious concrete because of the unique composition. The designer of a storm water management plan should ensure that the pervious concrete is functioning properly through visual observation of its drainage characteristics prior to opening of the facility.  Cold climates  Concerns over the resistance to the freeze-thaw cycle have limited the use of pervious concrete in cold weather environments. National Concrete Pavement Technology Center. Report No. 2006-01. The rate of freezing in most applications is dictated by the local climate. Entrained air may help protect the paste as it does in regular concrete. The addition of a small amount of fine aggregate to the mixture increases the durability of the pervious concrete. Avoiding saturation during the freeze cycle is the key to the longevity of the concrete. Related, having a well prepared 8 to 24 inch (200 to 600 mm) sub-base and drainage will reduce the possibility of freeze- thaw damage. Using permeable concrete for pavements can make them safer for pedestrians in the winter because water won't settle on the surface and freeze leading to dangerously icy conditions. Roads can also be made safer for cars by the use of permeable concrete as the reduction in the formation of standing water will reduce the possibility of aquaplaning and porous roads will also reduce tire noise.  Maintenance  To prevent reduction in permeability, pervious concrete needs to be cleaned regularly. Cleaning can be accomplished through wetting the surface of the concrete and vacuum sweeping.

Life Kris was born in 1900 to Leopold Kris, a lawyer, and Rosa Schick in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. Kris not only practiced as a psychoanalyst, he also worked as an art historian and published articles on art history. As a psychoanalyst, he made some important contributions to the psychology of the artist and the psychoanalytic interpretation of works of art and caricature. In the review Imago he published his first psychoanalytic study, \\"Ein geisteskranker Bildhauer\\" (A mentally ill sculptor) on Franz Xaver Messerschmidt. During the end of the 1910s and the beginning of the 1920s, Kris studied art history under Max Dvo≈ô√°k and Julius von Schlosser at the Department of Art History at the University of Vienna, from which he received his doctorate in 1922. One of the professors was Emanuel Loewy, a friend of Sigmund Freud. In 1927 Kris married Marianne Rie, the daughter of another friend of Freud, Oscar Rie. They had two children. Kris and his wife both became psychoanalysts and Kris began to publish psychoanalytic papers. A year later, in 1928, Kris intensified his working relationship with Freud, and he became a member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. Between 1930 and 1938, Kris worked as a lecturer at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1933, Freud asked Kris to become editor of the Imago magazine, in which he published a paper relating art to psychology in 1936. He argued that the difference between the artist and the psychotic is that the artist can return from the world of his imagination to the real world, while the psychotic cannot. In 1938, Kris fled to England, after Hitler invaded Austria. In England he became a lecturer and training analyst at the London Institute of Psychoanalysis, until 1940. In London, he also established a working relationship with art historian Ernst Gombrich concerning the art of caricature.E. H. Gombrich (with Ernst Kris), \\"The Principles of Caricature\\", British Journal of Medical Psychology, Vol. 17, 1938, pp. 319-342. At the same time, Kris analyzed Nazi radio broadcasts for the BBC, as his friend Gombrich also did. In 1940, Kris and his family moved to New York, where he became a visiting professor at the New School for Social Research, where he founded the Research Project on Totalitarian Communication (1941‚Äì44) alongside Hans Speier. In 1943 he began to work as a lecturer at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and the College of the City of New York. In 1945 he co-founded the journal The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child with Anna Freud and Marie Bonaparte. In 1946, Kris became a fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and an associate of the American Psychological Association. He also became a member of the editorial board of the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association. Kris dedicated the last years of his life to the psychoanalytic theory, ego psychology, early childhood development and a theory of psychoanalytic technique. Kris was one of the first developers of the new ego psychology, a school of psychoanalysis that originated in Freud's ego-superego-id model. He proposed a new way to enter the unconscious; not via a fast and immediate entrance, but via exploration by the surface. It consists of exposing defense mechanisms and not of exploring the id.

It was written as a counterpoint to his story \\"2430 A.D.\\" with the intention of refuting, rather than illustrating, the same quotation by writer and social commentator J. B. Priestley. It was published in the January 1972 issue of Analog and reprinted in the 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories. The quotation by Priestley runs: \\"2430 A.D.\\" had been commissioned by Think, the house magazine of IBM, but was rejected because it confirmed Priestley's quote. Think requested another story refuting the quote. The rejection of \\"2430 A.D.\\" came when Asimov's marriage to his first wife was coming to an end. On July 3, 1970, he moved out of his house in West Newton, Massachusetts and took up residence in the Cromwell Hotel in New York City. After settling in, Asimov felt the need to write something, to prove to himself that the disruption of his life had not impaired his writing ability. Thus, on July 8, he wrote \\"The Greatest Asset\\", mailing it to Think the following day. On July 22 Asimov received word that Think had rejected \\"The Greatest Asset\\" and would, instead, be running \\"2430 A.D.\\". Having the first piece of writing he produced after moving to New York rejected came as a blow to Asimov. On July 27 he visited John W. Campbell, editor of Analog magazine, and told him of Thinks rejection of \\"The Greatest Asset\\". Campbell told him that his own needs and judgment were different from Thinks and asked to see the story. Within a week Campbell accepted it, and \\"The Greatest Asset\\" appeared in the January 1972 issue of Analog. Plot summary The action takes place on a future Earth that has established a totally controlled and balanced ecology. The Secretary-General of Ecology, Ino Adrastus, controls all the ecology with the aid of massive computers. He is visited by Jan Marley, a science writer, to whom Adrastus claims to be no more than a clerk whose sole task is to sign the directives produced by the computers. Marley is invited to witness a meeting between Adrastus and Lou Tansonia, a medical researcher from the moon colony, whose proposal involving setting up experimental ecologies has been rejected by the computers. After Tansonia explains his proposal, Adrastus approves it against the recommendation of the computers. This leads Marley to think that he was there specifically to witness this act. After Tansonia leaves, Adrastus explains to Marley that a common saying attributed to Tansonia is slightly misquoted as being, \\"Man's Greatest Asset is a balanced ecology.\\" Whereas it should say that \\"Man's greatest *need* is a balanced ecology. Man's greatest *asset* is the unsettled mind.\\" This is because unsettled minds are a necessary prerequisite for \\"man to be man - which is more important than merely to live.\\" Adrastus is then revealed to have almost certainly engineered this encounter to correct this misattribution.

Marin began his career in his native Cuba, working as a groom and an exercise rider at the Oriental Park Racetrack, in Havana. In 1935, he signed on as the agent for Fernando Fern√°ndez, and the rider was Cuban champion for the next seven years. In 1943, the pair moved to Mexico City to compete at Hipodromo de Las Americas, and Fern√°ndez led the nation's riders there for three years straight. When a riding contract for Mexican president Avila Camacho expired, the pair headed to the United States, where Fernandez became a leading rider on the East Coast circuit until 1953. Retiring that same year, Fernandez ranked seventh on the list of world's winningest riders, with over 2,500 career wins. Agent Harry Silbert, Bill Shoemaker, and Marin, Chicago, 1967 For the next several years, Marin represented riding stars Don Brumfield and Manuel Ycaza, both future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductees, as well as \\"Milo\\" Valenzuela, winner of the 1958 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes on Tim Tam, for Calumet Farm. In 1960, Marin discovered Panamanian jockey Braulio Baeza while on vacation, secured a riding contract for him with Alabama sportsman Fred W. Hooper, and represented him for the next four years. During this time together they won the 1963 Kentucky Derby aboard Chateaugay, two Belmonts, two Jeromes and a host of other stakes . Baeza was elected to the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame in 1976. Trainer Chuck Parke, Braulio Baeza and Marin,at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack, 1961 In 1966, Marin introduced nineteen-year-old Laffit Pincay Jr. to the American Turf.

He has held this post since October 2013. In 2017 he applied for Head coach of Indian cricket team. Born in the North-East of England, Pybus grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne till the age of 12 when his parents emigrated to Australia, attending Normanhurst Boys' High School in Sydney. In 1979 his family returned to the UK to the North West of England. Pybus finished his school education at Ulverston Victoria High School in Cumbria. He completed a BA.Hons at Portsmouth University and a postgraduate Certificate of Education at Greenwich University, London. He is a cricket coach and former coach of the Pakistan and Bangladesh national cricket teams, he was consultant coach to Pakistan during the 1999 Cricket World Cup when they progressed to the final. He is currently the most successful coach in South African first- class cricket having guided the Titans and the Cape Cobras to nine championship titles over six seasons, winning the Supersport Series Four Day Competition four times. He has completed the domestic double three times in a row as a coach, twice with the Titans and once with the Cape Cobras. He was awarded the South African Cricket Coach of the year in 2008‚Äì09 and 2010‚Äì11 by Cricket South Africa. Pybus' cricketing ambitions as a right-arm fast-medium bowler were ended by injury. He played both rugby and minor county cricket for Suffolk, cricket from 1986 to 1991 (cite) cricket archive, and Worcestershire's 2nd XI in 1990. He turned to coaching in his early twenties after five surgeries.  Early coaching career  Pybus began his professional coaching career at Selborne College in East London, South Africa. Professional Cricket Coach from 1991 to 1995 where he developed Mark Boucher as a wicket keeper. He was Border U-19 Coach in this period and brought through Makhaya Ntini and Justin Kemp in a side unbeaten at the National U-19 week, captained by Boucher. Pybus joined Border Cricket in 1995 and ran the Youth Cricket department, before going on to set up Border Cricket's first cricket academy, The Mercedes Benz Border Cricket Academy, of whom Ntini was a graduate.  Senior coaching career  In 1998 Pybus took up the position of Border Cricket head coach, with Ntini and Boucher being key players in this side. In his first season in charge they got to the finals of the Supersport first-class four day competition [2] and Standard Bank One day competition [3], it was the first time in Border cricket's history that they had competed in a first-class final. He was approached by Pakistan to work with them for the 1999 Cricket World Cup where they went on to be losing finalists to Australia. This led to his dismissal. He was then invited to coach Pakistan full-time during the later half of 1999 on a two-year contract, one day into his new contract there was a military coup and the cricket board that had appointed him was dissolved. He was sacked one month into the job, along with Wasim Akram after they lost the Test series to Australia. In 2000‚Äì2001, on a one-year contract with Border cricket he again took them to the Supersport four day final and the Standard Bank One day cup semi-final. At the end of the South African season he re-joined Pakistan for a third time at the inception of Waqar Younis's captaincy, they toured England, tying the Test series with England 1‚Äì1 and losing the One day triangular final to Australia at Lords in a re-run of the 1999 World Cup Final. He was not willing to come to Pakistan but he was persuaded and continued with Pakistan in September 2001 with the Asian Test Championship, beating Bangladesh in Multan. At the end of the Multan Test, Pakistan were due to play a Test series against New Zealand in Pakistan, the series was called off because of the 11 September terrorist attacks and foreign nationals were told to leave the country because of security concerns. Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman General Tauqir Zia appointed Pybus to coach Pakistan for a fourth time in September 2002 after a series of poor results. The side were fractured with divisions in the dressing room that characterised so much of Pakistans turbulent cricket troubles. They had mixed results, losing the Test series to Australia in Colombo and Sharjah, beating Zimbabwe in Tests and ODI's in Zimbabawe and losing the Test series and ODI's to South Africa in South Africa. It led up to a disappointing Cricket World Cup in 2003 where Pakistan were eliminated in the first round, it was a bridge too far for an aging Pakistan team, coming at the end of an era with the retirements of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar. In 2005 Pybus took over as Head Coach and Professional Cricket Manager at Titans between 2005 and 2009. In 2005 they were joint Supersport four day champions and losing finalists in the Standard Bank One Day competition. In the 2006-7 season the Titans won the SuperSport four day competition with a record of played 10, won 8 and were unbeaten during the competition, it is the second best four day record in a season in South African cricket history title=Richard_Pybus&action;=edit&editintro;=Template:BLP_editintro# after the Transvaal 'Mean Machine' played 10 and won 9 in the Currie Cup. During this period Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Albie Morkel and Paul Harris came through from the Titans and established themselves as regular South African players. Pybus was appointed 1st XI coach of Middlesex in February 2007. However, on 17 July 2007 Middlesex announced he had left the club with immediate effect \\"for personal reasons\\". On 1 August 2007 he re-joined Titans as coach on a two-year contract.[5] From 2007 to 2009 the Titans built on the success of the previous two years and the side cemented their place as the dominant side in South African first-class cricket. They did the domestic double in 2007-08 where they won the MTN One Day competition and the Pro20 competition. In 2008‚Äì09 the side repeated their success by again winning the Supersport four day competition and the One Day competition, Pybus was acknowledged for this success by being awarded the South African Cricket Coach of the year in 2009. Faf du Plessis, Imran Tahir and Farhaan Behardien came through in this period and established their South African credentials. Having won 6 titles in four years at the Titans, including the Supersport four day competition 3 times in four years, Pybus chose not to re-new his contract and took a sabbatical year. He trained as an Executive Coach and did consultancy coaching work with the Natal Dolphins and with Eastern Province cricket. On 25 September 2009 it was confirmed that Richard Pybus will be the coach of Kolkata Knight Riders (A team in IPL) Two days before the announcement KKR player Sourav Ganguly had stated that the coach of KKR was decided and would be announced soon. Pybus wasn't the new KKR coach, he was appointed the coach of the Cape Cobras in South Africa and over the next two seasons would help the Cobra's take over the Titan's mantle of the most successful cricket side in the country. He would again do the domestic double for the third coaching year in a row, this time with a team under his former Border player, Justin Kemp's leadership. The side won the Supersport four day competition and the Pro20 competition to qualify for the Champions League. Vernon Philander and Richard Levi emerged in this period as South African cricketers. In 2011-12 the Cape Cobras won the One Day competition against the Warriors at Newlands and Pybus had three of his original Border U-19 side on the field, Justin Kemp and Mark Boucher playing for the Cobras and Makhaya Ntini playing for the Warriors. The Cobras having led the Supersport competition for much of the season, lost out to the Titans in the final match of the competition and ended as runners up. On 30 May 2012, it was announced that he would be the new coach of the Bangladesh cricket team [6], during his tenure they played T20 cricket in a buildup to the T20 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka where they played 16 and won 12 during this period. Pybus left them after five months after a contract dispute with the Bangladesh cricket board.

The stream is believed to have been named by an 18th-century trapper and hunter named John Simpson, who encountered herds of elk along the stream. Geography Elk Creek rises approximately southwest of Philippi in western Barbour County and flows generally west-northwestwardly into Harrison County, where it passes through the communities of Stonewood and Nutter Fort; it flows into the West Fork River in the city of Clarksburg.DeLorme (1997).

Bernstein. cdb acts as an on-disk associative array, mapping keys to values, and allows multiple values to be stored for a single key. A constant database allows only two operations: creation and reading. Both operations are designed to be very fast and highly reliable. Since the database does not change while it is in use, multiple processes can access a single database without locking. Additionally, since all modifications create a replacement database, it can take advantage of UNIX filesystem semantics to provide a guarantee of reliability. Record positions, key and value lengths, and hash values are 32-bit quantities and therefore must fit into 4 gigabytes.CDB specification cdb is used by djbdns, fastforward, mess822, qmail and ucspi-tcp to provide highly efficient, reliable, and simple data access. Structure A database contains an entire data set (e.g. a single associative array) in a single computer file. It consists of three parts: a fixed-size header, data, and a set of hash tables. Lookups are designed for exact keys only, though other types of searches could be performed by scanning the entire database. Lookups are performed using the following algorithm: * Hash the key. * Determine at which hash table and slot this record should be located. * Test the indicated slot in the hash table. ** If the slot is empty, the record does not exist. Abort the search. ** If the slot's hash matches the key's hash, seek to the record. Read and compare the key. If it matches, the data has been found, so end the search. ** The record is not in this slot. Proceed to the next slot, wrapping around to the beginning of the hash table if necessary. For lookups of keys with multiple values, additional values may be found by simply resuming the search at the next slot. Format All numbers‚Äîoffsets, lengths, and hash values‚Äîare unsigned 32-bit integers, stored in little endian format. Keys and data are considered to be opaque byte strings, and have no special treatment. The fixed-size header at the beginning of the database describes 256 hash tables by listing their position within the file and their length in slots. Data is stored as a series of records, each storing key length, data length, key, and data. There are no alignment or sorting rules. The records are followed by a set of 256 hash tables of varying lengths. Since zero is a valid length, there may be fewer than 256 hash tables physically stored in the database, but there are nonetheless considered to be 256 tables. Hash tables contain a series of slots, each of which contains a hash value and a record offset. \\"Empty slots\\" have an offset of zero. Hashes are unsigned 32 bit integers, and start with a value of 5381. For each byte of the key, the current hash is multiplied by 33, then XOR'ed with the current byte of the key. Overflow bits are discarded. Slots and tables are trivially computed from hashes. The target table is simply the lowest eight bits of the hash (i.e. hash modulo 256), and the slot within the table is the remaining bits of the hash modulo the table length (i.e. hash divided by 256 modulo table length). Library The official cdb library code is public domain: the individual source files are marked as such, and are also available in the public domain djbdns package. However, the rest of the cdb package used to be license-free software, meaning it must be distributed verbatim. The unusual licensing and simplicity of the format has prompted others to re-implement the library and release it under more common terms, such as Michael Tokarev's TinyCDB library, available under the public domain. In 2009, all of cdb was put in the public domain. Notably, the creator of cdb does not intend for cdb to be used as a shared library. This differs from virtually all similar dbm- like databases, such as Berkeley DB.

In journeying through the wilderness, and having crossed the > Cheat river at the Horse shoe, a quarrel arose between Simpson and one of > the Pringles; and notwithstanding that peace and harmony were so necessary > to their mutual safety and comfort; yet each so far indulged the angry > passions which had been excited, as at length to produce a separation. > Simpson crossed over the [Tygart] Valley river, near the mouth of Pleasant > creek, and passing on to the head of another water course, gave it the name > of Simpson's creek. Thence he went westwardly, and fell over on a stream > which he called Elk: at the mouth of this he erected a camp, and continued > to reside [there] for more than twelve months. During this time he neither > saw the Pringles nor any other human being; and at the expiration of it went > to the South Branch, where he disposed of his furs and skins and then > returned to, and continued at, his encampment at the mouth of Elk [present- > day Clarksburg], until permanent settlements were made in the > vicinity.Withers, Alexander Scott (1831), Chronicles of Border Warfare, or, > A History of the Settlement by the Whites, of north-western Virginia: and of > the Indian wars and massacres, in that section of the state; with > reflections, anecdotes, &c.;, Clarksburg, Va.: J.

Hypervideo is thus analogous to hypertext, which allows a reader to click on a word in one document and retrieve information from another document, or from another place in the same document. Hypervideo combines video with a non-linear information structure, allowing a user to make choices based on the content of the video and the user's interests. A crucial difference between hypervideo and hypertext is the element of time. Text is normally static, while a video is necessarily dynamic; the content of the video changes with time. Consequently, hypervideo has different technical, aesthetics, and rhetorical requirements than a static hypertext page. For example, hypervideo might involve the creation of a link from an object in a video that is visible for only a certain duration. It is therefore necessary to segment the video appropriately and add the metadata required to link from frames‚Äîor even objects‚Äîin a video to the pertinent information in other media forms. History Kinoautomat (1967) was the world's first interactive movie. Modern Hypervideo systems implements some of core concepts of this movie such as non linear narrative and interactivity. Video-to-video linking was demonstrated by the Interactive Cinema Group at the MIT Media Lab. Elastic Charles was a hypermedia journal developed between 1988 and 1989, in which annotations, called \\"micons\\", were placed inside a video, indicating links to other content. When implementing the Interactive Kon-Tiki Museum, Liestol, Gunner. Aesthetic and Rhetorical Aspects of linking Video in Hypermedia Listol used in order to represent video footnotes. Video footnotes were a deliberate extension of the literary footnote applied to annotating video, thereby providing continuity between traditional text and early hypervideo. In 1993, Hirata et al. Hirata, K., Hara, Y., Shibata, N., Hirabayashi, F., 1993, Media- based navigation for hypermedia systems, in Hypertext '93 Proceedings. considered media based navigation for hypermedia systems, where the same type of media is used as a query as for the media to be retrieved. For example, a part of an image (defined by shape, or color, for example) could link to a related image. In this approach, the content of the video becomes the basis of forming the links to other related content. HotVideo was an implementation of this kind of hypervideo, developed at IBM's China Research Laboratory in 1996. Navigation to associated resources was accomplished by clicking on a dynamic object in a video. In 1997, a project of the MIT Media Lab's Object-Based Media Group called HyperSoap further developed this concept. It was a short soap opera program in which a viewer could click with an enhanced remote control on objects in the video to find information on how they could be purchased. The company Watchpoint Media was formed in order to commercialize the technology involved, resulting in a product called Storyteller oriented towards interactive television. Illustrating the progression to hypervideo from hypertext, Storyspace,Storyspace a hypertext writing environment, employs a spatial metaphor for displaying links. It utilizes 'writing spaces', generic containers for content, which link to other writing spaces. in 1996 HyperCafe,HyperCafe: Narrative and Aesthetic Properties of Hypervideo, Nitin Nick Sawhney, David Balcom, Ian Smith, UK Conference on Hypertext a popular experimental prototype of hypervideo, made use of this tool to create \\"narrative video spaces\\". It was developed as an early model of a hypervideo system, placing users in a virtual cafe where the user dynamically interacts with the video to follow different conversations. In 1997, the Israeli software firm Ephyx Technologies released a product called v-active, one of the first commercial object based authoring system for hypervideo. This technology was not a success though: Ephyx changed its name to Veon in 1999, at which time it shifted focus away from hypervideo to the provision of development tools for web and broadband content.. eline Technologies, founded in 1999, developed a hypervideo solutions called VideoClix. Today VideoClix is a used SaaS (Software as a Service) solution to distribute and monetize clickable video on the web and mobile devices. With the advantage that its videos can play back in popular video players such as QuickTime and Flash as well as multiple online video platforms such as Brightcove, ThePlatform, and Ooyala. VideoClix also offers technology that can be integrated into any 3rd party players based on Quicktime, Flash, MPEG-4 and HTML5. Rise of hypervideo As the first steps in hypervideo were taken in the late 1980s, it would appear that hypervideo is taking unexpectedly long to realize its potential. Many experiments (HyperCafe, HyperSoap) have not been extensively followed up on, and authoring tools are at the moment available from only a small number of providers. As the amount of video content increases and becomes available, the possibilities for linking video increase even faster. Digital libraries are constantly growing, of which video is an important part. News outlets have amassed vast video archives, which could be useful in education and historical research. Direct searching of pictures or videos, a much harder task than indexing and searching text, could be greatly facilitated by hypervideo methods. Concepts and technical challenges Hypervideo is challenging, compared to hyperlinked text, due to the unique difficulty video presents in node segmentation; that is, separating a video into algorithmically identifiable, linkable content. Video, at its most basic, is a time sequence of images, which are in turn simply two dimensional arrays of color information. In order to segment a video into meaningful pieces (objects in images, or scenes within videos), it is necessary to provide a context, both in space and time, to extract meaningful elements from this image sequence. Humans are naturally able to perform this task, but it's desirable to do so algorithmically. Developing a method to achieve this, however, is a complex problem. At an NTSC frame rate of 30 frames per second,NTSC Basics even a short video of 30 seconds comprises 900 frames. The identification of distinct video elements would be tedious if human intervention were required for every frame. For moderate amounts of video material, manual segmentation is clearly unrealistic. From the standpoint of time, the smallest unit of a video is a single frame. Node segmentation could be performed at the frame level‚Äîa straightforward task as a frame is easily identifiable. However, a single frame cannot contain video information, since videos are necessarily dynamic. Analogously, a single word separated from a text does not convey meaning. Thus it is necessary to consider the scene, which is the next level of temporal organization. A scene can be defined as the minimum sequential set of frames that conveys meaning. This is an important concept for hypervideo, as one might wish a hypervideo link to be active throughout one scene, though not in the next. Scene granularity is therefore natural in the creation of hypervideo. Consequently, hypervideo requires algorithms capable of detecting scene transitions. One can imagine coarser levels of temporal organization: scenes can be grouped together to form a narrative sequence, which in turn are grouped to form a video. From the point of view of node segmentation, however, these concepts are not as critical. Even if the frame is the smallest time unit, one can still spatially segment a video at a sub-frame level, separating the frame image into its constituent objects. This is necessary when performing node segmentation at the object level. Time introduces complexity in this case also, for even after an object is differentiated in one frame, it is usually necessary to follow the same object through a sequence of frames. This process, known as object tracking, is essential to the creation of links from objects in videos. Spatial segmentation of object can be achieved, for example, through the use of intensity gradients to detect edges, color histograms to match regions, Smith, Jason and Stotts, David, An Extensible Object Tracking Architecture for Hyperlinking in Real-time and Stored Video Streams, Dept. of Computer Science, Univ. of North Caroline and Chapel Hill motion detection, Khan, Sohaib and Shah, Mubarak, Object Based Segmentation of Video Using Color, Motion and Spatial Information, Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Central Florida or a combination of these and other methods. Once the required nodes have been segmented and combined with the associated linking information, this metadata must be incorporated with the original video for playback. The metadata is placed conceptually in layers, or tracks, on top of the video; this layered structure is then presented to the user for viewing and interaction. Thus the display technology, the hypervideo player, should not be neglected when creating hypervideo content. For example, efficiency can be gained by storing the geometry of areas associated with tracked objects only in certain keyframes, and allowing the player to interpolate between these keyframes, as developed for HotVideo.U.S. Patent 6912726 Furthermore, the creators of VideoClix emphasize the fact that its content plays back on standard players, such as Quicktime and Flash. When one considers that the Flash player alone is installed on over 98% of internet-enabled desktops in mature markets,Adobe - Flash Player Statistics this is perhaps a reason for the success of this product in the current arena. Commentary User replies to video content, traditionally in the form of text or image links which are not embedded into the playback sequence of the video, have been allowed through such video hosting services as Viddler to become embedded both within the imagery of the video and within portions of the playback (via selected time lengths inside the progress slider element); this feature has become known as \\"video comments\\" or \\"audio comments\\". Commercial exploitation Perhaps the most significant consequence of hypervideo will result from commercial advertising. Devising a business model to monetize video has proven notoriously difficult. The application of traditional advertising methods‚Äîfor example introducing ads into a video‚Äîis likely to be rejected by the online community, while revenue from selling advertising on video sharing sites has so far not been promising. The Economist, Aug 31st 2006, The trouble with YouTube. Hypervideo offers an alternate way to monetize video, allowing for the possibility of creating video clips where objects link to advertising or e-commerce sites, or provide more information about particular products. This new model of advertising is less intrusive, only displaying advertising information when the user makes the choice by clicking on an object in a video. And since it is the user who has requested the product information, this type of advertising is better targeted and likely to be more effective.

Given his name, it is likely that he came from Evesham, Worcestershire. University career Hugh studied at Oxford University in the 1260s. At some point in his student career he became friends with John Peckham, future Archbishop of Canterbury. According to the manuscript of John Bale's mid-16th century Index Britanniae Scriptorum Reginald Lane Poole (ed.), Anecdota Oxoniensia 9 (Oxford 1902), p. 170.), he was a Doctor of Medicine and the author of Quaestiones on Isaac's liber febrium.A.

Little, The Grey Friars at Oxford (Oxford 1892), Appendix C, pp. 76-77 and 331, 333. By 1275 Master Hugh was Archdeacon of Worcester,John Le Neve, Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae III, p. 74; the appointment was made by Bishop Godfrey Giffard (1268-1302), brother of Archbishop Walter Gifford of York. and on 9 June 1275, Archdeacon Hugh was granted permission by Bishop Gifford to go to \\"parts beyond the sea\\" for the purpose of study.J. W. Willis Bund (editor), Episcopal Registers, Diocese of Worcester. Register of Bishop Godfrey Giffard, September 23rd, 1268 to August 15th, 1301 Volume II (Oxford 1902), p. 74. This meant that he went to study in Continental Europe. On 16 September 1275, however, Hugh was still in the Diocese of Worcester, for he received a mandate from the Bishop to proclaim the forthcoming ceremony of purgation of a criminal of his crime.Register of Bishop Godfrey Gifford II, p. 85. Royal Clerk and Diocese of York By the early 1270s he was working as a royal clerk, giving his services to King Edward I of England. By the end of the decade he had gained a wide reputation as a great physician.

He is the \\"Magister Hugo de Ewesan\\", canon of York, who participated in the election of William de Wickwane, Chancellor of York, as Archbishop of York, on 22 June 1279. Chancellor William, who received all the votes except his own, voted for Hugh.Jules Gay (editor), Registres de Nicolas III (Paris 1898), 559; W. H. Bliss (editor), Calendar of Papal Registers I (London 1893), p. 459; Le Neve Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae III, p. 103.

Brown (ed.), The Register of William Wickwane, Lord Archbishop of York (1279-1285) (Surtees Society 1907), p. 22. Rome and a Cardinalate Hugh and Archbishop Wickwane preserved their friendship, even after he went to Rome. On 12 September 1280 Archbishop Wickwane named Master Hugh of Evesham, Canon of York, and Stephen Patringtone his proctors at the Papal Curia, and so notified Cardinals Giacomo Savelli and Matteo Rosso Orsini The Register of William Wickwane, p. 183. In 1282 he was asked to assist the Archbishop in disputes with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Durham. While at Rome, he probably became a personal physician to Pope Martin IV and was entrusted with finding a cure to an epidemic that was then current in the city of Rome. He seems to have become friends with another English physician at Rome, Cardinal John of Toledo. Hugh became a successful Papal courtier and received a numerous rewards. On 12 April 1281 he was made a Cardinal-Priest with the title of San Lorenzo in Lucina  and his chaplain, Alan de St Edmund, was made Bishop of Caithness after the bishop-elect, Hervey de Dundee, died at Rome while seeking Papal confirmation.Registres de Martin IV, no. 132, p. 50; Bliss, Calendar of Papal Registers I, p. 464 Conclave of 1285 Cardinal Hugh participated in the conclave of 1‚Äì2 April 1285, at Perugia, where he had found refuge after being driven out of Orvieto. In the Conclave Cardinal Giacomo Savelli, Cardinal Deacon of S. Maria in Cosmedin, was elected on the first ballot.Sede Vacante and Conclave of 1-2 April 1285 (Dr. J. P. Adams). He took the name Honorius IV. When Honorius IV died on Holy Thursday, 3 April 1287, Cardinal Hugh was one of the thirteen cardinals who participated in the Conclave, which took place in Rome at the papal residence near Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill.Conrad Eubel Hierarchia Catholica medii aevi I second edition (1913), 10 n. 11. He was the senior cardinal-priest. The Conclave opened in April, but the cardinals had one difficulty after another. The plague broke out in the Conclave, and a number of cardinals died; the rest retreated for a time to their private residences. Six cardinals, the sources say, died in 1287. One of them was Cardinal Hugh. The survivors finally elected a new pope on 22 February 1288, Cardinal Girolamo Masci d' Ascoli, OFM, the Bishop of Palestrina, who took the name Nicholas IV.Sede Vacante and Conclave of 1287--1288 (Dr. J.

He is a pioneer for the revival of the authentic, uncompromised natural trumpet. Biography After studying at Hofstra University, New York University, Columbia University and the University of Oxford, where he was awarded a D. Phil. (Ph.D.) in the history of music in 1967, Smithers became associate professor at Syracuse University and, thereafter, Docent for the History of Music and Musical Performance at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague in 1975. As a music historian, Don Smithers has conducted groundbreaking research on the baroque trumpet, having contributed a number of articles and books on its social and historical contexts, as well as its allegorical role in music from the Renaissance and Baroque. Special interests of his research include the work of J.S. Bach and Bach's parts for brass instruments. He has played a decisive role in the revival of a historically based performance practice employing appropriate playing techniques with historically relevant instruments and mouthpieces. Besides his main topics of trumpet and Bach research, Smithers has been influential for the rediscovery of many important musical works, amongst them the seventeenth-century trumpet music preserved at the residence of the Bishops of Olomouc in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic), which include compositions by Biber, Schmelzer and Vejvanovsky. In 1968, during the height of the cold war, he even managed to establish a copy of the whole collection on microfilm, which was deposited in the University Library at Syracuse, New York. More recently, he was also responsible for the filming of the entire musical Mss. in the Schloss archives at Sondershausen, which includes most of the surviving cantatas of Gottfried Heinrich St√∂lzel. Following early recordings with ensembles like the New York Pro Musica, Musica Reservata, and the Studio der fruehen Musik, Smithers began to record a number of works for trumpet and cornetto with ensembles in Britain, Italy, West Germany and the former German Democratic Republic. Besides several soloistic recordings on trumpet and cornetto, Smithers took part in the first complete recording project of Bach cantatas with Gustav Leonhardt and Nikolaus Harnoncourt. He was the first to authentically perform and record trumpet parts, like those of cantatas Du sollt Gott, deinen Herren, lieben, BWV 77, and Es rei√üet euch ein schrecklich Ende, BWV 90, on an uncompromised copy of a Baroque-era natural trumpet and an original 18th-century mouthpiece. His last recording on LP, released in 1980, includes the difficult sonatas of C.H. and H.I.F. Biber and Mozart's Divertimento KV 188. Smithers‚Äô style of playing has often been described as \\"singing.\\" The similarities in sound production of singing to brass instrument playing have been crucial for his performing from the very beginning. Smithers is nearing the completion of a comprehensive work on the history of trumpets and related instruments from antiquity until the era of Beethoven.

Description The word Maval is derived from a Marathi word Maval, meaning the direction in which the sun sets. This region is towards the west of Pune area. It is hilly terrain and part of the Sahyadri range/western ghats. The Sahyadri range goes from north to south. On the western part of the range lies the Konkan area and on the eastern side 'Maval'. Many rivers originate from this region and travel from west to east. Broadly speaking, Maval is subdivided into 12 subregions. Each subregion is mostly identified by the name of a river. The names of the subregions are Andar Maval, Kanad Maval (Kanad Khore), Korbarse Maval, Gunjan Maval, Nane Maval, Pavan Maval, Paud Maval (Paud Khore), Mutha Khore, Muse Khore (or Mose Khore), Rohid Khore, Velvand Khore, Hirdas Maval etc. The highest point of this region is the Mahabaleshwar area, which is approximately 4500 feet above sea level. Maval is one of the world's highly biodiversified regions. It was the first abode of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who formed an army of the local inhabitants called 'Mavale'.Raeside, I. (1978).

It was designed and manufactured at British aviation company Airco. Development was led by the aircraft designer Geoffrey de Havilland as a replacement for the obsolete Airco DH.2. The DH.5 was one of the first British fighter designs to include the improved Constantinesco gun synchronizer, which allowed a forward-firing machine gun to fire through the propeller faster and more reliably than the older mechanical gears. It was also one of the earliest biplanes to feature a marked \\"back-stagger\\" of its wings. Despite these advances, by the time the DH.5 was fielded, it was already notedly inferior to other fighters that had entered into production and thus proved to be both unpopular and unsatisfactory amongst the pilots of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). As such, the type was quickly withdrawn from service as soon as supplies of the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 permitted. Design and development=Origins Shortly after completing work upon the twin-seat Airco DH.4 light bomber, Captain Geoffrey de Havilland commenced work on a new single-seat fighter aircraft to replace the obsolete Airco DH.2 fighter, which was designated at the DH.5.Bruce 1966, p. 3. The design sought to combine the superior performance of a tractor biplane with the excellent forward visibility of a pusher type. The resultant aircraft was a relatively compact single-bay biplane, while the construction was that of a conventional tractor biplane, the mainplanes were given 27 inches of backward stagger, so that the lower wing was positioned forward of the upper wing.Jackson 1962, p. 49. This configuration enabled the pilot to be positioned underneath the leading edge of the wing, providing uninterrupted forward and upward views; aviation author J.M Bruce refers to this approach as having been radical for the era. The first prototype emerged during late 1916, and underwent manufacturer's trials at Hendon Aerodrome in the hands of test pilot B.C. Hucks. It was powered by a single Le Rh√¥ne 9Ja rotary engine, capable of providing up to 110hp of thrust, which drove a twin-bladed propeller. The fuselage had flat sides aft of the wings and featured relatively short fairings either side of the circular engine cowling; towards the rear of the airframe, the fuselage tapered to the tail, which comprised a small fin and horn-balanced rudder arrangement. The equal-span single-bay wings were outfitted with atypically large ailerons on both the upper and lower mainplanes, a rubber bungee cord attached to the upper ailerons to return them to their standard position. At one early stage, it was known that the prototype was outfitted with a small hemispherical spinner. As the pilot was seated forward of the centre of gravity, the main fuel tank was necessarily behind the cockpit, below the oil tank. An auxiliary gravity fuel tank was fitted over the top mainplane, offset to the right. Into flight Initial test flights with the prototype determined that it lacked sufficient directional control, a finding which led to a revised and enlarged fin and rudder combination being adopted. Early on, the first prototype had been flown in an unarmed state. Around the same time as the revised tail unit was installed, it was also decided to arm the aircraft in preparation for official trials. Upon being armed, the prototype armament installation comprised a single forward-firing .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun, which was either fixed to fire upward at an angle or possibly mounted so that its elevation could be adjusted in flight; in the production installation the gun was given a more conventional fixed mounting on top of the cowl, offset to the left, to fire in the line of flight.Bruce 1965, p. 129.Lamberton 1960, p. 42. Bruce notes that it appeared that the DH.5 was designed with the intention of typically attacking enemy planes from below, a decision that he described as ironic considering its limited operational ceiling in comparison to its contemporaries. On 9 December 1916, the first DH.5 prototype commenced its service trials at the Central Flying School. The official report compiled from the observations of its pilots was largely favourable, stating that it possessed satisfactory stability and controllability, its favourable qualities for reconnaissance and agility, but also observed a poor view to the rear.Bruce 1966, pp. 3-4. The type's speed was a significant advance over its DH.2 predecessor, but it was also recognised that some existing fighters were already capable of exceeding its capabilities, especially its climbing abilities. It has been speculated that performance may have been negatively impacted via the adoption of an alternative four-bladed propeller during testing.Bruce 1966, p. 4. Production By the time that trials had commenced in France, superior types such as the Sopwith Camel and the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 were not far behind. The performance of the new fighter was also inferior in most respects to the earlier Sopwith Pup. The provision of a single machine gun at a time when most fighters carried two also meant the aircraft was considered to be somewhat under-armed for operations in 1917. Nevertheless, on 15 January 1917, the DH.5 was ordered in quantity production in the form of two contracts for a combined 400 aircraft. A total of four manufacturers were involved in producing the type: Airco (200), British Caudron (50), Darracq (200) and March, Jones & Cribb (100).Bruce 1957, p. 185. The design of the DH.5 was subject to extensive changes prior to entering mass production. A substitute fuel system was adopted, which included an additional five-gallon gravity tank mounted above the upper wing and a pressured main tank directly behind the pilot's seat. The appearance of the aircraft was drastically changed via the revised fuselage, which now had an octagonal cross section and featured additional stringers around the area of the engine cowling. Directional control was also altered, introducing a rudder that lacked a horn balance. Unusually, some of these changes made the aircraft more complex to manufacture. In terms of its construction, the main fuselage structure was produced in two sections that were butt-joined at an attachment point upon the rear-section struts. Extensive use was made of plywood across the structure, while the remainder used conventional wire-braced wooden box-girden. While some DH.5s were built with the original rubber bungee return springs on the ailerons, later-built examples used a system of pulleys and balance cables.Bruce 1966, pp. 4-5. A major positive feature of the aircraft was its great structural strength, which was revealed during April 1917 in destructive testing.Bruce 1966, p. 5. Operational history The introduction of the DH.5 to squadron service with the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was protracted; according to Bruce, these delays, which had been mainly generated as a result of Airco's focus having been centered upon the more successful DH.4, had greatly hindered the type's prospects.Bruce 1966, pp. 5-6. On 1 May 1917, the first DH.5 arrived with No. 24 Squadron of the RFC; deliveries were slow, as the squadron had only a handful of the type by 7 June. The DH.5 was not well regarded by the squadron, and this negative attitude would not be a unique outlook.Bruce 1966, p. 6. Soon after entering service, the DH.5 quickly proved to be most unpopular amongst the RFC. Its unconventional appearance led to rumours (that were largely unfounded) of handling difficulties. There were also claims that the DH.5 had gone into service against the wishes of its designers.Bruce 1966, p. 7. What was true was that the DH.5's performance would rapidly drop off at altitudes in excess of and that while it was very manoeuvrable, it tended to lose altitude quickly in combat. The unusual position of the upper mainplane resulted in an unfortunate blind spot above and to the rear (which was the very direction from which a single-seater would generally be attacked from). A DH.5 serving with the Australian Flying Corps in September 1917 The robust construction, good performance at low altitude and the pilot's good forward field of view made the aircraft a useful ground- attack aircraft. In this capacity, the type served with distinction in the Battle of Cambrai. During the battle, the DH.5 had, in conjunction with Sopwith Camels, provided airborne mobile machine gun coverage to friendly troops on the ground, strafing enemy trenches and leading to extensive losses. However, the process of replacing the type had already commenced beforehand, and the meritorious performance at Cambrai did little to halt this withdrawal.Bruce 1966, p. 8. The DH.5 has the historical distinction of having formed the initial equipment of No. 2 Squadron Australian Flying Corps, the first Australian fighter squadron. It did not prove satisfactory, incidents in which enemy twin-seater planes were able to escape the single-seat DH.5 were not uncommon. It served mainly in the ground-attack role until December 1917, when the type was replaced by the S.E.5a. By this time, the withdrawal of the type from the Western Front was already almost complete - the last DH.5 squadron receiving the S.E.5a in January 1918.Taylor 1969, p. 339. DH.5s issued to training units proved unpopular and the type soon vanished from RFC service.Jackson 1962, p. 52. A number of retired aircraft were reused as trials machines, some of these tests included alternative gun mountings, jettisonable fuel tanks and plywood coverings.Bruce 1966, p. 9.

It is designed for the quantitative measurement of equal-spreading of the spots on the chromatographic plate and is one of the Chromatographic response functions. Formula Retention uniformity is calculated from the following formula: R_{U} = 1 - \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{6(n+1)}{n(2n+1)}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\\\left(R_{Fi}-\\\\frac{i}{n+1}\\\\right)^2}} where n is the number of compounds separated, Rf (1...n) are the Retention factor of the compounds sorted in non-descending order.  Theoretical considerations  The coefficient lies always in range <0,1> and 0 indicates worst case of separation (all Rf values equal to 0 or 1), value 1 indicates ideal equal-spreading of the spots, for example (0.25,0.5,0.75) for three solutes, or (0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8) for four solutes. This coefficient was proposed as an alternative to earlier approaches, such as D (separation response), Ip (performance index) or Sm (informational entropy). Besides its stable range, the advantage is a stable distribution as a random variable, regardless of compounds investigated. In contrast to the similar concept called Retention distance, Ru is insensitive to Rf values close to 0 or 1, or close to themselves. If two values are not separated, it still indicates some uniformity of chromatographic system. For example, the Rf values (0,0.2,0.2,0.3) (two compounds not separated at 0.2 and one at the start ) result in RU equal to 0.3609.

History=Early history Taney's origins go back to the early Irish saint Nathi, who in the 6th century established a centre for monastic life. This centre may have been on what is now the site of St. Nahi's Church in Dundrum. The derivation of the parish name, Taney, suggests that it derives from the Irish Teach Nahi or Nahi's house. Another possible source is Tamhnach, meaning a green field or arable spot. While there are no details available, there seems little doubt that religious worship was taking place here for some considerable time before the Anglo-Norman Invasion of 1169-1171, which made use of a Papal Bull asserting Rome's rights to all islands off the coast of Europe. The Rural See (seat of a Rural Bishop) of Taney is mentioned in a report of Cardinal Paparo in 1152. The next record is as \\"the Deanery of Tanhy\\" in a taxation list sent from Rome to the Diocese of Dublin. When Henry II granted Leinster to Strongbow, Tacheny was one of two areas held back, being allocated to Hugh de Clahull, who later passed his Dublin lands to the Archbishop of Dublin. In a Papal Bull of 1179, there is a reference to \\"the middle place of Tighney\\" (annotated in the Liber Niger of a later Archbishop, Alen, as \\"alias Tawney\\"), with a church and three subsidiary chapels (at Donnybrook, Kilgobbin and Rathfarnham). In 1235, the Rural Dean of Taney was J. Matthew. Archbishop Luke (1228‚Äì1255) established Taney as a prebend of St. Patrick's Cathedral and until 1851, the Archdeacons of Dublin held the Prebendary and the post of Rector of Taney, and the parish was chiefly overseen by curates-in-charge. Taney in the Church of Ireland At some point between the separation between Henry VIII and Rome and the reign of Elizabeth I, the parish became part of the State Church. The Roman Catholic heritage of the district eventually became part of a Union Parish, overseen from Booterstown (the Church of Ireland parish also spent much of the ensuing centuries as part of a Union, that of St. Peter's in the south inner city). In a reference of 1546, there is mention of Taney Rectory, and annual rentals totalling 19 pounds, which formed the salary of the resident curate. By 1615, Archbishop Thomas Jones reported in a royal visitation record that there was a resident curate, Robert Pont (also taking services in Donnybrook and Rathfarnham), that the \\"Church and Chancel\\" (of St. Nahi) were in good repair, and that prayer books were available. By 1630, when Richard Prescott became curate, the rentals had risen in value to 100 pounds a year but Archbishop Bulkeley reported in that year that the church was in poor condition and that there were only two attending householders (most of the local population still adhered to the Roman Catholic Church). The next curate was John Sankey, also responsible for Donnybrook, Rathfarnham, Kilgobbin, Cruagh and Whitechurch. In 1753, one A. Archball became curate, moving from service in Howth and Kilbarrack, and Jeremy Walsh took office in 1758, supervising the rebuilding of Taney Church in 1760, as attested to by a chalice still held there, presented by Archdeacon Isaac Mann. The new building was consecrated on 8 June of that year. Walsh was succeeded by William Dwyer (1787) and Matthew Campbell (1787‚Äì1814). The parish school appears to have been started during Reverend Campbell's time, with references found to \\"the Charity School of Tanee\\" back to 1890. There is also reference to a George Horan as curate in 1792, possibly the first of a number of Curates Assistant. The earliest original parish records, deposited in the Library of the Representative Church Body,RCB library and dating back to 1791, are useful for determining the population and activities of the parish over time. Early 19th century In 1802, Taney still held the status of a Rural Deanery, including the churches of Taney itself (St. Nahi's), Kilgobbin, Rathfarnham, Stillorgan, Crumlin and Tallaght. As the local population (notably of Dundrum and Churchtown) and the parish membership grew, the old church became too small, and by 1809, discussions were well underway on replacing the parish church with a new and more spacious structure. The first formal proposal, for the site now occupied by Christ Church, was considered by the Select Vestry on 22 October 1809, but failed. However, after discussion with the leaseholder and the landowner, and other representations, moneys were sought from the Board of First Fruits, and ¬£4,300 were lent. The decision to build was finally made in 1814, after a visit to the new church at Monkstown, which design was used as a model. Richard Ryan became curate in that year and oversaw construction, which commenced in mid-1815, with additional funds being raised by the sale of pews in 1816, as the budget was exceeded. Christ Church, ca. 1895 Christ Church was completed and opened for worship in 1818, with a licence issued, unusually, by the Archbishop of Cashel, and an initial consecration took place on 21 June 1818. This original Christ Church was rather smaller than the current building. Henry Hunt was curate from 1820‚Äì1821, followed by W. Vance (1821) and James Bulwar (1821‚Äì1824). Easter Vestry accounts of 1824 show costs for a vestry room, a 5-hundredweight bell and a sexton's house. Henry Hamilton became non- resident curate in 1824, and in 1825, A. Campbell replaced him, as resident curate, followed in 1830 by Dr. Thomas Prior. In 1829, an Infant School was launched, and at some point in that period, part of the old church was converted into a Boys School (another part was used for funeral services), and a Girls Charity School established in a cottage at one end of the burial ground. In the later 1820s, and again in 1832, work was done to improve the roof of Christ Church, the South Gallery was added in 1833 and in 1835 the Ecclesiastical Commissioners gave 256 pounds towards interior decoration. In 1836, when C.A. Schoales became curate, a Sunday School was opened (later this held the Infant School and teacher's residence, and then a sexton's residence). William Stanford was curate from 1837 to 1851. Mid- to late 19th century In 1850, the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum was opened (now the Central Mental Hospital) and when, in July 1851, Taney was established as an independent parish, the chaplaincy of this facility was attached to the post of rector. Taney's independence marked the beginning of the end of arrangements which had seen the Archdeacons of Dublin holding office additionally as vicars of the large St. Peter's Parish in the south city, and Rectors of Taney, Rathfarnham (also independent in July 1851) and Donnybrook (made independent in 1864). The first rector was Andrew Bredin and he was succeeded in 1857 by Busteed Moeran. On the first Sunday of May, 1859, following a petition to the rector and the issue of a licence by the Archbishop of Dublin, services for the coastwards part of the parish were begun in a cottage in the grounds of a house called Seafield in Stillorgan, local families contributing 30 pounds for fitting of a room, and 30 towards an attending curate's salary. William Hamilton became rector in 1867. Hamilton, who was also a Rural Dean, Prebendary of Harristown, and then of St. Michan's and Chaplain to the Lord Lieutenant, led the parish until 1895. At Christ Church, the stained glass east window, paid for by the Roe family, was dedicated in March 1871, and a new organ bought by Henry Roe, who also famously paid for the restoration of Christ Church Cathedral. After Mr. Roe paid off all remaining building finance, it was possible to fully consecrate Christ Church, which the Archbishop of Dublin did on 10 June 1872. By 1873, the cottage at Seafield was too small for the eastern congregation, and the landlord, the Earl of Pembroke, offered a site at the corner of Fosters Avenue and Stillorgan Road, in Mount Merrion. After much fund-raising, the modern parish's third church, St Thomas', was built there in 1874, operating initially as a chapel-of-ease. In 1867, a licence was granted for the performance of Divine Service at what was then still known as the 'Dundrum Lunatic Asylum' and Church of Ireland services are held regularly at the Central Mental Hospital to this day, though the original Church of Ireland chapel was donated to the local Catholic parish in the later 19th century. In 1895, Messrs. Hamilton and Ball published a work on the Parish of Taney Dublin: 1895, Hodges, Figgis and Co.; Ball, Elrington Francis and Hamilton, Everard: \\"The Parish of Taney: A History of Dundrum, near Dublin, and its Neighbourhood\\" ‚Äì at this time, the old Church of St. Nahi was in disuse but services did resume there by the early 20th century. Also in 1895, John J. Robinson became rector, overseeing the building of the parochial hall from 1897 to June 1898. In 1897, a new Church of Ireland School was established at Eglinton Terrace, paid for by Lord Pembroke, with all parochial school activities moving there. This became a National School in 1898. In addition, in 1898, a parish magazine was launched, lasting until 1913. By the turn of the 20th century Taney Parish comprised the following townlands: Balally, Ballinteer, Churchtown, Drummartin, Dundrum, Farranboley, Friarsland, Kingstown (D√∫n Laoghaire), Mount Anville, Mount Merrion or Callary, Rathmines, Roebuck, Ticknock and Trimlestown or Owenstown. Taney Parish from 1900 to 1956 In 1901, W. Monk Gibbon, founder of the first Boys‚Äô Brigade Company in Dublin while a curate at St. Mattias in 1890, was appointed as rector. Gibbon would serve for over 34 years, becoming a canon of Christ Church Cathedral in 1923. He founded a Dundrum Company of the Boys‚Äô Brigade also, which was replaced in 1922 by troops of Boy Scouts (SAI, now Scouting Ireland) and Girl Guides. 1901 also saw the establishment of the local branch of the Mothers' Union. The school was extended in 1905. In 1909, services in St. Nahi's Church were suspended due to the dangerous condition of the roof, which had to be replaced. The rector led much other restoration work on the old church also, including making of new flooring and seats, with main rebuilding completed in 1910. A. W. F. Orr became was rector from 1935 to his retirement in 1958; he was made a canon of Christ Church Cathedral in 1946. Canon Orr died in 1964 and the oak stair at Christ Church was erected in his memory. In 1945, a special meeting was held to address the decline of parish organisations and parochial hall use, and sixteen groups were started or restored. The separation of the Parish of Mount Merrion St. Thomas's became the parish church for a new Parish of Mount Merrion in 1956, after conclusion of discussions that had begun in 1948. Trevor Hipwell, senior curate of Taney, was appointed as its first Rector, occupying a newly built rectory by the church. A few years later, in 1965, the church was extended. In 1994, Mount Merrion Parish was placed in a Group with the Parish of Booterstown (which had previously absorbed Carysfort Parish), and the two parishes, still with separate Select Vestries, share a rector, at the St. Thomas Rectory. The Joint Parish Office is also at the Mount Merrion site, and services are celebrated at both sites. Taney Parish from 1956 Walter Burrows became rector in 1959, having established a new church at Crumlin, and in 1968, the 1897 school was superseded by one at Sydenham Villas. Desmond Harman served as curate assistant from 1967 to 1973; he later became Dean of Christ Church Cathedral (an office he held until December 2007). Desmond Sinnamon succeeded Rev. Burrows as rector in 1983. After some debate, it was decided in 1989 to sell the old Parochial Hall (which raised 433000 pounds) and to build a new Parish Centre in the church grounds (whose freehold was bought out). The foundation stone of the new centre (beside Christ Church) was blessed on 11 November 1990, with the centre, with classrooms, meeting spaces and offices, was completed in September 1991 and opened by the President of Ireland on Thursday 21 November 1991. Significant work was also done on the Parish National School in the closing years of the 20th century. At the beginning of the new millennium, the present parish is bounded by those of Milltown to the north, Ticknock to the south, Churchtown to the west and Goatstown to the east. With over 800 families and more than 2000 parishioners, Taney is now the largest Church of Ireland parish in Ireland in numerical terms. Also in 2000, the Church was selected as the location for the old peal of change-ringing bells from St George's Church in Dublin City. The Rector of Taney Parish is Canon Robert Warren who succeeded Canon Desmond Sinnamon (also Chancellor of St. Patrick's Cathedral) in 2012. Rev. John Tanner was curate from 2003 (as Deacon from 2003 to 2004, then as Priest) to 21 September 2007, when he became Rector of Tullow Parish, in the Carrickmines area. Rev. Stephen Farrell became Rector of Zion parish in 2011, Rev. Niall Sloane took up the Rectorship of Killiney parish in 2012 and was elected Dean of Limerick Cathedral in 2017. Christ Church organ The organ of Christ Church Taney was originally built by Forster and Andrews. However, the majority of its current pipework comes from a Telford organ. This instrument was installed in Christ Church, Bray some time in the 19th Century and then moved to St. Paul's, Bray. St. Paul's eventually became redundant and in 1989, the organ was brought to Taney and installed by Kenneth Jones and Associates. Most of the original Forster and Andrews pipes were discarded or used by Jones in other projects.

Mohiniraj Temple The city of Nevasa is mainly famous for the Mohiniraj temple, the avatar(incarnation) of Lord Vishnu who beheaded Rahu and Ketu while distributing nectar. Every year a big festival of Shri Mohiniraj gets celebrated on the full moon day (Pournima) in the month of Magha of the Hindu calendar, which corresponds to January‚ÄìFebruary, in remembrance of Lord Vishnu's Mohini Avatar after Samudra manthan. The elegantly designed Mohiniraj Temple in Ahmednagar is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The new structure of this temple was constructed in 1773 at a cost of about Rs. 5 Lakhs by Gangadhar Yashwant Chandrachude. The 75 feet tall temple is decorated all over with ornamental work. The shrine houses an image of Mohiniraj, better known as Lord Vishnu. Also, in the Sabhamandap (Meeting Room), several images of other gods and goddesses such as Ganesh, Shiv ‚Äì Parvati, Shani and Hanuman are displayed for their devotees. According to a legend associated to this place, at the time when the sea was churned to get nectar, Lord Vishnu appeared in the form of Mohini(a beautiful and enchanting damsel) to distract the demons and deprive them of nectar. The demons stared at Mohini while Lord Vishnu distributed nectar to the gods and water to demons. Throughout the year three fairs are held in the town of Nevasa in honour of Mohiniraj. About fifty thousand people attend these fairs. Also part of this area is called Dandakaranya. The place where Lord Ram killed Marich is now a village called Toka, named after the arrow which Lord Rama used to kill Marich. Before Marich was killed by Lord Rama, he threw a Sura(Knife) towards Rama. This village is called Suregaon. After that he threw Bhala (spear), and hence that place is called Bhalgaon. Soon after that Marich shot an arrow, that place is called Banganga. At Banganga, the path of the river Godavari is shaped like a DhanushyaBan(Bow and arrow), so this place is called BANGANGA.  Other information  The remains of a multilevel settlement dating from the Paleolithic period to the Middle Ages have been discovered at Navasa. Excavations were conducted by H. D. Sankalia in the 1950s and by G. Karve- Corvinus in 1967. Nevasa's Aeneolithic layer reveals a settled agricultural culture characterized in the second millennium B.C. by implements (elongated plates) similar to those of the Harappa civilization. Newasa is also famous as sasurvadi (in laws) of Lord Khandoba, The First wife of Lord Khandoba is from Newasa bk name Mahalasa so khandoba is called Mhalasakant.

Often this is in the form of a match for which all the ticket proceeds are given to the player in question. However hosting one of these matches is a risk for the player in question as he/she is responsible for paying any relevant receipts and collects any excess income from the match, therefore income from such matches is more often than not reliant on attendance. Sometimes, the \\"beneficiary\\" can opt to give part or all of the money to charity. An example of this is Paul Collingwood's 2007 benefit with Durham County Cricket Club. This may also occur when sportsmen unite for a cause, for example the Rafael Nadal vs Roger Federer \\"Match for Africa\\" (2010) where more than $2.6 million was raised for the Roger Federer Foundation, enabling children living in poverty to realise their potential.  History  Benefit matches originated in English county cricket in a time period where playing sport, in particular cricket, for a living didn't offer as big of an income as it does in modern society (2015), holding a benefit at a player's 10 year service mark or retirement mark was considered a form of retirement/insurance policy. Benefit matches are confused with Testimonial matches, it's important to note that this is a direct gift from the club where income is guaranteed unlike in a benefit where income is often dependent on attendance. Similar events were organised in Baseball in the 1860s, these events often occurred at season end involving the stars of the sport to acknowledge a significant member of the sport. However a rule established by the NABBP in 1859 prohibited any player compensation, the basis of this rule was to maintain fair game in competition and avoid professional vs. amateur situations arising.

It is calculated from the following formula: R_D = \\\\Bigg[(n+1)^{(n+1)} \\\\prod^n_{i=0}{(R_{F(i+1)}-R_{Fi})\\\\Bigg]^{\\\\frac{1}{n}}} where n is the number of compounds separated, Rf (1...n) are the Retention factor of the compounds sorted in non-descending order, Rf0 = 0 and Rf(n+1) = 1.  Theoretical considerations  The coefficient lies always in range <0,1> and 0 indicates worst case of separation (all Rf values equal to 0 or 1), value 1 indicates ideal equal-spreading of the spots, for example (0.25,0.5,0.75) for three solutes, or (0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8) for four solutes. This coefficient was proposed as an alternative to earlier approaches, such as delta-Rf, delta-Rf product or MRF (Multispot Response Function). Besides its stable range, the advantage is a stable distribution as a random variable, regardless of compounds investigated. In contrast to the similar concept called Retention uniformity, Rd is sensitive to Rf values close to 0 or 1, or close to themselves. If two values are not separated, it is equal to 0. For example, the Rf values (0,0.2,0.2,0.3) (two compounds not separated at 0.2 and one at the start ) result in RD equal to 0, but RU equal to 0.3609. When some distance from 0 and spots occurs, the value is larger, for example Rf values (0.1,0.2,0.25,0.3) give RD = 0.4835, RU = 0.4066.

While such ships have been proposed in the past by both the United States and the Soviet Union, none has ever been built (though at least one of the larger Soviet designs did start construction). Converted or standard submarines have often been used to transport small groups of soldiers or supplies, however.SS / SSG / APSS / LPSS 282 Tunny (submarine datasheet from the Globalsecurity.org website). In the Soviet Union The Soviet Union had some experiences using submarines to shuttle weapons, supplies and special forces into besieged areas or behind enemy lines in World War II, specifically during the siege of Sevastopol.The First Soviet Giants - Polmar, Norman, book excerpts adapted for Undersea Warfare, Fall 2001, Issue 4, Vol 1 Project 621 After the war, in 1948, Project 621 was proposed as a landing ship-transport submarine to set down troops behind enemy lines. With some 5,950 tons, the underwater giant would have been one of the largest submarines of its day. On its two vehicle decks, it was to carry a full infantry battalion of 745 troops, 10 T-34 tanks, 12 trucks, 12 towed cannons, and 3 catapult-launched La-5 fighter aircraft for air cover. The troops and vehicles meanwhile would be unloaded over a bow ramp when the submarine beached on the surface. Project 664 While Project 621 was not built, follow-up designs got even larger and even more ambitious, though this was eventually to be their downfall as well. The additional capabilities, from being expected to do underway replenishment for other submarines to being capable of providing submarine rescue tended to delay the projects which were otherwise considered fully feasible. At least one, Project 664, started construction at Severodvinsk in 1964, but the mixed requirements of replenishment, transport, and mine-laying caused major complications in combination, even with the proposed nuclear propulsion. Project 748 In the late 1960s, another proposal, Project 748, neared construction, a nuclear- powered assault transport (with less added requirements than previous designs) of up to 11,000 tons. This submarine was to carry up to 20 amphibious tanks and BTR-60P armored personnel carriers, and up to 470 troops, with the vehicles stored in double-deck hulls contained to both sides of the main hull, all three within an outer shell. The submarine was to be equipped with a torpedo armament of four bow 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes (18 to 20 torpedoes stored) as well as anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles. It also was to have mine-laying capabilities. In the end, while the shipyards had already begun to prepare for the production of five submarines of the 748 type, this project was also scrapped in the early 1970s, as the manufacturing capacity was needed for new ballistic missile submarines. The ideas proposed during these projects helped drive the proposals for nuclear-powered merchant submarines by Russian design offices in the 1990s. In the United States The U.S. Navy has in the past also undertaken some preliminary design of submarine transports, but never the extent of the Soviet design efforts. In the 1950s a 10,000-ton submarine was proposed, 220 meters (720 ft) long, and with a beam of 38 meters (124 ft). It was to carry 2,240 Marines, landing them using 'amphibious flying platforms' with an undefined propulsion method, supposed to move at 100 mph (160 km/h).

Current jurisdictional error issues for NCAT In February 2017, the New South Wales Court of Appeal issued a declaration that the NSW Administrative and Civil Tribunal (NCAT) (which handles a range of small civil disputes), has no jurisdiction if one party lives in another state. This issue is currently under discussion in the NSW Parliament and is likely to be subject to amending legislation shortly. History The tribunal was created by the Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal Act 2001 (NSW). It replaced the former Fair Trading Tribunal of New South Wales and the Residential Tribunal of New South Wales. The former tribunals had been criticised in the New South Wales Parliament for being unresponsive and slow. The current tribunal is the latest attempt to improve consumer dispute resolution in New South Wales. Constitution The tribunal consists of a Chairperson and Deputy Chairpersons. Senior Members and Members are also appointed to the tribunal. Senior members hear more complex cases. The tribunal may also use assessors to determine particular issues. Assessors are generally experts in the field that there is a dispute in. Structure The Tribunal has eight Divisions, i.e. General, Motor Vehicles, Tenancy, Home Building, Commercial, Strata and Community Schemes, Residential Parks, and Retirement Villages. Some of the Divisions limit the amount of money that may be claimed (e.g. $25,000 in the General Division and $500,000 in the Home Building Division), but others have no upper limit. Registries of the tribunal are located in Sydney, Parramatta, Hurstville, Penrith, Liverpool, Newcastle, Wollongong and Tamworth. Applications may lodged at those registries. The tribunal also sits at other country venues depending on the amount of work in those areas. Divisional structure The General Division deals with consumer claims in relation to goods and services, which may include faulty goods and work by traders not performed properly. The tribunal can award a maximum of $25,000. The Motor Vehicles Division handles disputes about new and used motor vehicles (including motor boats) and repairs. There is no maximum claim in the vehicle is new and used for private use. The Tenancy Division deals with breaches of leases, excessive rent increases, termination of the rental agreement, and the return of rental bonds. An order can be made up to $20,000 with respect to a rental bond or $10,000 for other matters. The Home Building Division deals with matters under The Home Building Act 1989 (NSW). The tribunal has jurisdiction to $500,000. The Commercial Division deals with disputes over credit contracts under the Consumer Credit (New South Wales) Act 1995 (NSW)(which is also known nationally in Australia as the Consumer Credit Code of Australia) and the Credit Act 1984 . The Division also deals with disputes over the licensing and conduct of travel agents under the Travel Agents Act 1986 (NSW), and commission fees charged by real estate agents licensed under the Property, Stock and Business Agents Act 1941 (NSW). The Strata and Community Schemes Division deals with disputes under the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 (NSW). These disputes relate to strata by-laws, maintenance levies, reallocation of unit entitlements, and alterations to common property. The Retirement Villages Division deals with disputes under the Retirement Villages Act 1999 (NSW). It deals with issues such the terms of a retirement village contract, the legality of a village rule, and the sale or lease of premises by a resident. The Residential Parks Division deals with disputes under the Residential Parks Act 1998 (NSW). Issues for dispute may involve the terms of the residential tenancy agreement, notices of termination, alterations and additions to dwellings, rent issues, rental bonds, and so on. The Residential Parks Division is rather unusual as it is one of the few divisions that has group hearings. Group hearings often have large numbers of applicants, and these applicants are usually represented by an advocate. These advocates normally work for organisations like the Tenants Advice Services, the Affiliated Residential Park Residents Association or the Northern Alliance of Park Residents Association. Procedure Parties are normally expected to run their own cases and pay their own costs, although legal representatives are allowed and costs may be awarded in certain circumstances. These restrictions are intended to make the Tribunal process quick, informal and affordable. Parties usually appear in person, but may also appear by telephone in certain circumstances. Review A party who disagrees with the determination of the Tribunal can apply for a rehearing if specific criteria are met. An appeal may be lodged with the District Court of New South Wales on a question of law. Peer Review Panel The Peer Review Panel consists of the two Deputy Chairpersons and one other person appointed by the Minister for Fair Trading. The panel reviews matters referred to it by the Chairperson, Director-General of the Department of Fair Trading or the Minister, and in due course, provides advice in response. Matters considered by the Panel may include the investigation of complaints against Members, taking disciplinary action against them, and the educational and training needs of Members.

He held canonries in the dioceses of Aberdeen and Caithness when, in 1263, he was elected Bishop of Caithness. The decree of election was presented to Pope Urban IV by Roger de Castello, a canon of Aberdeen. The election was declared contrary to canon law, but the Pope took into account the poverty of the diocese of Caithness with the costs of the journey to Rome from such a distant diocese, and delegated the authority to judge the fitness of Walter to the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and Ross.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 226. As is usual with bishops of Caithness, very little is known about Walter's episcopate. It is known he received a subsidy from the king taken from the profits of justice in the province.

This ritual is also practiced by the Kshatriya and Vaishya community, who are dvijas and therefore have the rights to do Sandhyavandanam, the daily ablution ritual. UpƒÅkarma is conducted once a year during the shravana or Dhani·π£·π≠hƒÅ nak·π£atra of the Hindu calendrical month ≈örƒÅvana, when Brahmins ritually change their upanayana thread accompanied by relevant ≈õrauta rituals, making ≈õrƒÅddha offerings to the rishis, whom Hindus believe composed the Vedic hymns.http://www.hindu- blog.com/2007/08/significance-of-avani-avittam.html The day, also called ≈örƒÅvana P≈´rnima \\"Full Moon of ≈örƒÅvana\\" in other parts of India, usually occurs the day after the ≈öravana n√°k·π£atra, which also marks the Onam festival of Kerala. On the following day, usually coinciding with the Raksha Bandhan festival in Northern and Central India, the Gayatri Mantra is recited 1008 times. Brahmins belonging to the Samaveda do not perform upakarma rituals or change their thread on this day but rather on BhƒÅdrapada tritiya, the third day of the month BhƒÅdrapada with Hastaa nakshatra. Shukla Yajurvedic Brahmins of North India and Odisha do upakarma the previous day if the full moon spans two days.  When Upakarma is Observed  The day on which upakarma is performed differs between various sects. Traditional learners of Yajurveda observe the Yajur upakarma in the month of Shraavana (August‚ÄìSeptember), on the full moon day;http://www.ramanuja.org/sv/rituals/upakarma/significance.html more particularly, Yajur upakarma is held on the full-moon day that comes before the new-moon day of the month of Shraavana (Aavani in Tamil calendar). Rig Vedic Upakarma is observed on that day of Shraavana month which has Shravana nakshatra and falls in the sukla paksha (waxing moon period). Rig Vedic Brahmins change the sacred thread on that day, irrespective of whether it is a full-moon day (purnima) or not. Shukla Yajurvedic bramhins of North India and Odisha do upaakarma on the previous day if Purnima spans two days (shukla chaturdashi yukta Purnima). Sama Vedic Upakarma is observed on the day after Shravan Amavasya on Hastha nakshatra thruteeya. Sometimes this might occur on Ganesh Chaturthi. Irrespective of the Veda, Gayatri Japa is observed on the day after Yajur Upakarma by all. Upakarma Variation According to Nirnaya Sindhu following conditions should be taken care for deciding the date of upakarma * Rigveda Upakarma:Should be done on the day in shraavana where shravana is the star and spans at least from sunrise to mid day. But not in Uttara Ashadha if present during sunrise. * Samaveda Upakarma: Should be done on hasta nakshatra on bhadrapada shuklapaksha * Krishna Yajurveda: i.e. Taittiriyas & Maitrayanis should do on shravistha, dhanistha,(avittam in Tamil), on shraavana month, whether it falls on purnima yukta Pratipada (Pratipat)during sunrise (Telugu- paadyami) or prathama. * Shukla Yajurveda: i.e. Vajasaneyi Kanvas and Madhyandinas do in purnima day if purnima is present up to evening.But if punima and pratipada both are present on next day(para viddha) they should do on previous day when chaturdashi stays in day and then purnima comes after mid day(purva viddha).Under no condition they should do/avoid doing in krishna paksha pratipat or broadly speaking they should finish upakarma before approach of krishna paksha.but they postpone upakarma to the next day if purnima is having Uttara Ashadha nakshatra. * Atharva Veda: They do on the day when purnima lasts during sunrise.(udaya vyapini tithi) Upakarma in Eclipse/Solar Sankramana * If there occurs Eclipse and sankranti when sun enters Leo (masa pirrapu/avani 1st in Tamil) during purnima, the people having upakrama for that day should be finished prior to punima when hasta nakshatra is available (generally shravana shukla Panchami/shashti.and for samaveda, if there is sankramana (purattasi 1st) to kanya in bhadrapada then shraavana month's hasta should be considered. * If shraavana sudha Panchami(hast) day is having sankramana/sankranti and purnima is having eclipse then upakarma is postponed to Samaveda upakarma day, i'e. bhadrapada hasta nakshatra but only Vajasaneyi Shukla Yajurveda people can do upakarma on the Panchami(hasta) having simha sankramana and avoid upakarma on purnima having eclipse. * No one should do upakarma on a day having uttarashadha nakshatra or a lunar eclipse Legend Upakarma is usually held on the full moon day of the month of Sravana. The significance of this day is that Lord Vishnu took the form of a horse and restored the Veda that was stolen from Lord Brahma by the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. As lord Vishnu took the form of a horse, this incarnation is called Hayagriva or \\"horse-head\\". After lord Vishnu created lord Brahma, he taught Brahma the all eternal Vedas. Once lord Brahma had mastered the Vedas, he was filled with pride that he was the only entity that had the knowledge of the all eternal and holy Vedas. Lord Vishnu thought otherwise and created demons Madhu and Kaitabha from two water drops on the lotus that he mounts. He then instructed them to steal the Vedas from Lord Brahma and hide it. Thus, Lord Brahma was in a fix that he was not able to save the holy and all eternal Vedas from theft and prayed to Lord Vishnu to do the needy. Lord Vishnu took the form of Hayagriva or Hayavadana and restored the all pervading Veda to safety,. thus curbing the pride of Brahma. So the day of upakarma is also celebrated as Hayagriva utpatti. As the Vedas were restored on this day, Upakarma is performed on this day to mark a new beginning. Significance The learning of the Vedas begins in the month of Shraavana with a Upakarma and is temporarily terminated in Magha with an Utsarjana ritual, to be restarted in the next Shravan. However, it was found that six months in a year results in a very long period to complete the study of Vedas. In order to overcome this difficulty, Brahmins started skipping the Utsajana ritual and studied Vedas through all the months of the year. On this day, a Prayachittam is performed on two counts - to pardon the sin of learning Vedas in the prohibited period of the year and a general request to pardon all the sins committed by them during the year. Homams are held and Poonal, the sacred thread, is changed on this day.http://www.keralaiyers.com/festivals.html More details:http://www.raksha- bandhan.com/avani-avittam-upakramam.html The first step is a 'prayashchita', A prayer to atone the sins. It says, \\"For the removal of all my sins and thereby to secure a divine blessing and for qualifying myself to perform the essential duties of Brahmanas as prescribed in the vedas and smritis and adopted by the really good in their conduct I put on this Yagnopavita (the sacred thread, called poonool in Malayalam and Tamil)\\". Then a new Yagnopavita is worn. When the thread is worn another mantra is recited which means -\\"I put on the sacred thread which is highly pure, is inseparable from God, is capable of prolonging life and is the foremost in the accomplishment of a Brahmana. May such pure Yagnopavita bring strength and dignity.\\" While removing the old thread, the mantra means -\\"I remove with respect, the old broken thread by wear and tear, may the new one bring on long life and Brahmana's brilliance.\\" Procedure of Avani Avittam The procedure of upakarma varies from state to state. However there are two main procedures one followed in the old Carnatic Region and other in the Dravida region. Carnatic Region procedure is followed in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and parts of Maharashtra. According to the Rig Veda Upakarma, first they start with Punyahvaachana followed Saptarshi Pooja, Utsarjana Homa and later by Upakarmaanga Saptarshi pooja, tarpana and homa. In Yajur Veda Upakarma of Karnataka region, the procedure begins with Punyahavaachana, Pahi Trayodasha Homa, utsarjana and then Upakarma. Here they worship nava (nine) Kaanda Rishis who were the pioneers in the veda. Distinct feature of Karnataka's Upakarma is rishi pooja in detail, and utsarjana. The Dravida version of the same does not have them. After Yagnyopavitadhaaranana, new Yagnyopavita (the sacred thread) is worn and later Veda Aarambham is done. Following the same will be Viraja Homa and Brahma Yagna. In the first year of Upakarma, Nandi is also performed. Bachelors Brahmacharis will perform Agni Kaarya or Samhida Daanam. The prasadam of the day is specially made Satvada hittu made out of all fruits (banana, guava, grapes, custard apple, apple, dry fruits), milk, ghee, til, jaggery, cucumber and rice flour. This is said to be very good for the rishis who are considered to be old and don't have teeth. * Brahmin bachelors perform 'Samitha Daanam' and 'kamo karshith japam' after Mahasankalpam. * Thereafter, Kaanda Rishi tharpanam is performed with the help of family priest or elders. * As per the rituals, all the male members should have a light meal at night. * Next day after an early bath, 'Gayathri Japam' is done by everyone. Thereafter, Appam & Idli are served. * Green Gram, Dhal or Kondai Kadalai Sundal are offered as Neivedhyam for the Homam (Fire ritual). * The Homam is performed either in the house or in temples and the Arti is performed after everyone returns home. * Neivedhyam - Payasam, Vada, Gingely seeds, Rice. The other items that are served on this day are Curd Pachadi, Kosumalli Curry, Koottu, Pitlay, buttermilk, soup, rasam, dhal and chips, appalams. Inner meaning This day is also auspicious as the Brahmins offer libations of water to their ancestors to whom they owe their birth and to the great Rishis to whom they are highly indebted for spiritual knowledge and the Vedas themselves.

It is headed by the Archbishop of Dublin, who is also styled the Primate of Ireland. The diocesan cathedral is Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. Overview and history Diocese Highlighted Early Christianity in Ireland The broad Dublin area was Christian long before Dublin had a distinct diocese, with monasteries such as Glendalough as well as at Finglas, Glasnevin, Rathmichael, Swords, Tallaght. Several of these functioned as \\"head churches\\" and the most powerful of all was Glendalough. In the early church in Ireland, the church had a monastic basis, with greatest power vested in the Abbots of the major communities. There were bishops but not organised dioceses in the modern sense, and the offices of abbot and bishop were often comprised in one person. Some early \\"Bishops of Dublin,\\" back to 633, are mentioned in Ware's Antiquities of Ireland but the Diocese of Dublin is not considered to have begun until 1038, and when Ireland began to see organised dioceses, all of the current Diocese of Dublin, and more, was comprised in the Diocese of Glendalough. The Norse Diocese of Dublin Following a reverted conversion by one Norse King of Dublin, Sitric, his son Godfrey became Christian in 943, and the Kingdom of Dublin first sought to have a bishop of their own in the 11th century, under Sitric MacAulaf, who had been on pilgrimage to Rome. He sent his chosen candidate, Donat (or Donagh or Donatus), to be consecrated in Canterbury in 1038, and the new prelate set up the Diocese of Dublin as a small territory within the walled city, over which he presided until 1074. The new diocese was not part of the Church in Ireland but of the Norse Province of Canterbury. Sitric also provided for the building of Christ Church Cathedral in 1038 \\"with the lands of Baldoyle, Raheny and Portrane for its maintenance.\\"Dublin: Catholic Truth Society, 1911: Bishop of Canea: Short Histories of Dublin Parishes, Part VIII, p. 162 At the Synod of Rathbreasail, convened in 1118 by Gillebert (Gilbert), Bishop of Limerick, on papal authority, the number of dioceses in Ireland was fixed at twenty-four. Dublin was not included, the city being described as lying in the Diocese of Glendalough, but the Norse Bishops continued, still attached to Canterbury. The Reorganisation of the Church in Ireland, 1152 Then, in 1151, Pope Eugene III commissioned Cardinal Paparo to go to Ireland and establish four metropolitans, and at a general synod at Kells in 1152, Armagh, Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam, were created archiepiscopal sees. In a document drawn up by the then Archbishop of Tuam in 1214, the cardinal is described as finding both a bishop based in Dublin, who at the time exercised his episcopal office within the city walls only, and \\"He found in the same Diocese another church in the mountains, which likewise had the name of a city (Glendalough) and had a certain chorepiscopus. But he delivered the pallium to Dublin which was the best city and appointed that the diocese (Glendalough) in which both these cities were should be divided, and that one part thereof should fall to the metropolitan.\\" The part of North County Dublin known as Fingall was taken from Glendalough Diocese and attached to Dublin City. The new Archdiocese had 40 parishes, in deaneries based on the old senior monasteries. All dependence upon English churches such as Canterbury was also ended. The Early Archbishops The founding Archbishop of the larger Dublin Diocese, consecrated at Lambeth, was Gregory, with the Bishops of Kildare, Ossory, Leighlin, Ferns, and Glendalough reporting to him. The second Archbishop, from 1161 to 1179, was Saint Laurence O'Toole, previously Abbot of Glendalough, who had previously been elected as Bishop of Glendalough but had declined that office. During his time in office, the presence of the Church grew in Dublin city (by 1170 there were six churches other than the cathedral within the walls\\"dedicated to St. Michael, St. Olave, St. John, St. Mary del Dam, St. Martin and St. Nicholas (Within) - Dublin: Catholic Truth Society, 1911: Bishop of Canea: Short Histories of Dublin Parishes, Part VIII, p. 162) and religious orders from the continent came to Ireland (Augustinians, Dominicans, Franciscans and Carmelites had houses in Dublin, and the great convent of Grace Dieu, near Donabate, was an example of women's religious life and education). As part of this trend, Laurence installed a community of canons to minister according to the Aroasian Rule in the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, later known as Christchurch. The important house of Abbey of Saint Mary was founded in Dublin at that time, first under the Benedictine Rule, then passing to the Cistercians. Not only was the Irish Church transformed in that 12th century by new organisation and new arrivals from abroad, but Ireland's political scene was changed permanently by the coming of the Normans and the influence of the English Crown. Saint Laurence's successor was a Norman, and from then onward to the time of the Reformation in Ireland, Dublin's Archbishops were all either Norman or English.  Merge of Dublin and Glendalough  In 1185, the Lord of Ireland, John Lackland, granted the merger of the dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough. This was initially without effect as the charter lacked papal approval. When the bishop Macrobius died in 1192, a synod was held in Dublin under the direction of the papal legate Metthew O Enna. William Piro was elected as bishop of Glendalough and remained in office at least until 1212. Robert de Bedford was elected as successor in 1213 or 1214 but he had never the opportunity to take possession of the diocesan seat. Instead, John, now King of England, reissued a grant to join Glendalough to Dublin which was finally approved by Pope Innocent III in 1216 and confirmed by his successor Honorius III in the same year. Reformation When the Church in England broke communion with the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England was established by the state as the established church. Later, by decree of the Irish Parliament, a similar new body became the State Church in the Kingdom of Ireland. It assumed possession of most Church property (and so retained a great repository of religious architecture and other items, though some were later destroyed). The substantial majority of the population remained faithful to the Latin Rite of Roman Catholicism, despite the political and economic advantages of membership in the state church. They were obliged to find alternative premises and to conduct their services in secret. The English-speaking minority mostly adhered to the Church of Ireland or to Presbyterianism. In 1833, the two provinces of Dublin and Cashel were merged. Over the centuries, numerous dioceses were merged, in view of declining membership.

His services to the VFL were honoured by the awarding of VFL Life Membership, and his subsequent induction into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. Collingwood  Bruce Andrew was light framed wingman, and the 321st player to play for Collingwood's senior team.AFL Statistics: Bruce Andrew He was considered to be one of the fastest wingmen in the competition, and had good all round skills, although he was rather injury prone. He played his first senior game for Collingwood, on the wing, against Fitzroy in round 13 of the 1928 season on 14 July 1928, having been promoted from the Seconds to replace an out of form Jack Beveridge;Club Notes, The Argus, (Friday 13 July 1928), p.5. the match report in The Argus noted that \\"the new man, Andrew, from the second eighteen, fully justified his inclusion\\".Collingwood too strong: vigorous game at Fitzroy, The Argus, (Monday, 16 July 1928), p.6. He played from 1928 to 1932; and, then, as Club Vice-President, he returned to the football field at the end of the 1934, playing 4 games because the team was depleted due to injuries to the regular 1934 players. He played a total of 62 senior games in his VFL career. He was a member of the 1928 Collingwood premiership team; he played on Stan Judkins and received six free kicks.Free Kicks, The Argus, (Monday, 1 October 1928), p.12. In October 1928, after the 1928 season had finished, he badly damaged his neck whilst bathing at Mornington. He dived too deeply, and struck his head on the bottom. The injury was serious enough for the doctor who examined him at Mornington, to have him taken immediately by ambulance from Mornington to St Vincent's Hospital at Fitzroy.Dived too deep; footballer's neck injured,The Argus, (Monday, 22 October 1928), p.8.

On one occasion his individual brilliance and intelligent initiative was his downfall. Collingwood coach Jock McHale always insisted that his players remained in their position's set location at all times. Twice during one match, Bruce Andrew raced away from his position on the wing, and ran deeply into the forward line to kick two scintillating goals. Rather than being congratulated, he was immediately taken off the field by McHale; which meant, in those days, before the concept of \\"interchange\\", that Andrew was off the ground for the rest of the match.

He was born in Yorkshire, England in 1948, but emigrated to Australia at the age of 15. He is best known for his development of the Ewbank System, used in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa for grading climbs. Climbing Having learned to climb in his native country, he quickly became involved in the fledgling Australian rockclimbing scene, and went on to pioneer hundreds of new routes on crags around the country, particularly in the Blue Mountains in his home state of New South Wales. Many of Ewbank's first ascents are still regarded as classics of Australian climbing such as the Totem Pole in Tasmania and Janicepts (21) at Mount Piddington, which stood as the hardest climb in Australia for many years. Legacy His most lasting legacy was the development of the Ewbank System, ubiquitous throughout Australia, New Zealand and South Africa for grading climbs. It was an entirely new system, aimed at overcoming the problems at that time with English grades being limited to Extremely Severe, and American (YDS) grades being limited to 5.9. At the time these grades were thought to be the hardest humanly possible, and as people progressed they became unwilling to grade new climbs as harder and old grades became sandbagged. Ewbank proposed an open ended numeric-only grading system starting at 1 and (as at December 2013) extending as high as grade 35 (in Australia) / grade 37 (worldwide). This was the world's first open ended grading system. In addition to climbing, Ewbank also established Australia's first rockclimbing magazine, Thrutch. Later life Ewbank retired from active climbing in the early 1970s, disheartened by bolting wars and ethical changes, though he never truly gave it up. He was still involved in putting up major new routes in the Blue Mountains in the 1990s, and continued climbing recreationally. He pursued a career in music, releasing 2 albums while living in New York. His 1993 song \\"Bleeding to Death in America\\" was recorded by Tuli Kupferberg for his public access TV show Revolting News. He died in New York City after a long illness on 2 December 2013. He said of his career; \\"Young climbers today have their own lists of new names, and a lot of the indefinable attraction of the whole racket is somehow woven into the connecting thread that unites the eras and places these various names represent. Even now, as a broken-down old fart, I feel a tremendous kinship with some of these young climbers, though they are doing stuff technically far harder than anything we were doing in the Jurassic period. At the same time I feel an unbreakable bond with climbers of my own and previous generations. The central focus of the fetish of most young contemporary climbers may have moved closer and closer to the pure beauty and sheer technical difficulty of a single move, whereas the central focus of my fetish was how far back the last runner was. But it‚Äôs all relative, or at least it can be. From Tricounis to modern slippers, if you‚Äôre truly interested in taking a walk on the wild side you still can; and it doesn‚Äôt really matter what you‚Äôre wearing on your feet when you‚Äôre shitting in your pants.\\"  References  Australian rock climbers English emigrants to Australia 1948 births 2013 deaths ","title":"John Ewbank (climber)"},{"id":"9607865","text":"Shirur Kasar is a tehsil in Beed subdivision of Beed district in the Indian state of Maharashtra.

In 1979 he was introduced to the Serge modular synthesizer by Kevin Braheny who owned a 15-panel system (dubbed \\"The Mighty Serge\\"), which he used on Morning Jewel. He then built his own 12-panel Serge. With this he performed electronic music that was evocative of space. Planetary Unfolding was recorded around 1981, when Michael left Conrad's Continuum Studio. The musical ideas that Michael had been performing on the Serge were combined and developed, giving birth to 52 minutes of music divided into two parts, each part featuring three segments. The album was first released on Stearns' own label, Continuum Montage. It was reissued on CD from 1985 to 1991 by Sonic Atmospheres and is since unavailable: , the cd has not seen reissue on Stearns's 2000-launched label Earth Turtle. However, it is available as a high quality download from Michael Stearns' page https://michaelstearns.bandcamp.com/.

The vertices of odd degree in a graph are sometimes called odd nodes or odd vertices; in this terminology, the handshaking lemma can be restated as the statement that every graph has an even number of odd nodes. Proof Euler's proof of the degree sum formula uses the technique of double counting: he counts the number of incident pairs (v,e) where e is an edge and vertex v is one of its endpoints, in two different ways. Vertex v belongs to deg(v) pairs, where deg(v) (the degree of v) is the number of edges incident to it. Therefore, the number of incident pairs is the sum of the degrees. However, each edge in the graph belongs to exactly two incident pairs, one for each of its endpoints; therefore, the number of incident pairs is 2E. Since these two formulas count the same set of objects, they must have equal values. In a sum of integers, the parity of the sum is not affected by the even terms in the sum; the overall sum is even when there is an even number of odd terms, and odd when there is an odd number of odd terms. Since one side of the degree sum formula is the even number 2E, the sum on the other side must have an even number of odd terms; that is, there must be an even number of odd-degree vertices. Alternatively, it is possible to use mathematical induction to prove that the number of odd-degree vertices is even, by removing one edge at a time from a given graph and using a case analysis on the degrees of its endpoints to determine the effect of this removal on the parity of the number of odd-degree vertices. Regular graphs The degree sum formula implies that every r-regular graph with n vertices has nr/2 edges. In particular, if r is odd then the number of edges must be divisible by r, and the number of vertices must be even. Infinite graphs An infinite graph that does not obey the handshaking lemma The handshaking lemma does not apply to infinite graphs, even when they have only a finite number of odd-degree vertices. For instance, an infinite path graph with one endpoint has only a single odd-degree vertex rather than having an even number of such vertices. Exchange graphs Several combinatorial structures listed by may be shown to be even in number by relating them to the odd vertices in an appropriate \\"exchange graph\\". For instance, as C. A. B. Smith proved, in any cubic graph G there must be an even number of Hamiltonian cycles through any fixed edge uv; used a proof based on the handshaking lemma to extend this result to graphs G in which all vertices have odd degree. Thomason defines an exchange graph H, the vertices of which are in one-to-one correspondence with the Hamiltonian paths beginning at u and continuing through v. Two such paths p1 and p2 are connected by an edge in H if one may obtain p2 by adding a new edge to the end of p1 and removing another edge from the middle of p1; this is a symmetric relation, so H is an undirected graph. If path p ends at vertex w, then the vertex corresponding to p in H has degree equal to the number of ways that p may be extended by an edge that does not connect back to u; that is, the degree of this vertex in H is either deg(w) ‚àí 1 (an even number) if p does not form part of a Hamiltonian cycle through uv, or deg(w) ‚àí 2 (an odd number) if p is part of a Hamiltonian cycle through uv. Since H has an even number of odd vertices, G must have an even number of Hamiltonian cycles through uv. Computational complexity In connection with the exchange graph method for proving the existence of combinatorial structures, it is of interest to ask how efficiently these structures may be found. For instance, suppose one is given as input a Hamiltonian cycle in a cubic graph; it follows from Smith's theorem that there exists a second cycle. How quickly can this second cycle be found? investigated the computational complexity of questions such as this, or more generally of finding a second odd-degree vertex when one is given a single odd vertex in a large implicitly- defined graph. He defined the complexity class PPA to encapsulate problems such as this one; a closely related class defined on directed graphs, PPAD, has attracted significant attention in algorithmic game theory because computing a Nash equilibrium is computationally equivalent to the hardest problems in this class. Other applications The handshaking lemma is also used in proofs of Sperner's lemma and of the piecewise linear case of the mountain climbing problem. NotesReferences *. *.

Folk arts In Indian mythology the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu are collectively known as Dashavatara. To preserve the universe from destruction Vishnu took ten different forms (avatars) from time to time. They are Matsya (fish), Katchha (turtle), Varaha (boar), Narsimha (half man, half lion), Waman (a Brahman boy), Purshuram, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, and Kalki. In Sindhudurg Dashavatar is the most popular art form. Dance ritual dramas are held in most of the temples during festive occasions. Interesting characters in these dramas are Apsaras (heavenly maidens), whose roles are played by men in women's attire. There are nine original Dashavatara performing groups in Sindhudurg, and Walawalkar group is believed to be the first. Credit also goes to the pioneer Shymnaikji kale who introduced Dashavatar to Sindhudurg in the 11th century. The, same Dashavatar is today known as Adivere Dashavatar in which ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu are presented one after the other on the stage.

Dodamarg is a hilly region broken by valleys and surrounded by mountains. The main rivers flowing across the taluka is Tilari. Tilari dam is constructed on this river. Kalne river is one of the tributary of this river. There is a village named Mangeli at the eastern end Dodamarg taluka as well as on the border of Karnataka state. There are viewing points at Unneyi Bandharam, inter-state project of Tilari Dam, Rock Garden, the fort of Pargad and Hunumant Gad, Tervan Medhe, Kasainath Hill, Devotional places of faith like Nagnath Temple and elsewhere. The interstate dam project taken up under the auspices of Irrigation Dept. of Goa and Maharashtra State Govt. The Dam is constructed on Tilari river in Dodamarg Taluka. There is a large lake or reservoir formed by the Tilari Dam. Now-a-days, a number of wild elephants take shelter in the surroundings of Tilari. The dam and the lake at the distance of 45 km from Goa State, attract tourists as well as observers. The Wirdi fall in Dodamarg Taluka is so far an untouched site, at the distance of 20 km from Dodamarg Taluka place. For the last 10 to 15 years, people from Kerala have done deep study of land, water, and environment of this area and started plantation of Pineapples along with Banana. Now pineapple is one of the main products of taluka. Recent years elephants are also marking entry into Dodamarg taluka from Karnataka state through Khanapur jungle. This is the first time, elephants have found habitation in Maharashtra State. Tilari major irrigation project area (Dodamarg Taluka) is the main habitat.

However, in September 2003, the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, criticised the society, saying:Legal Services Complaints Commissioner (2005) p.5 As a result, in February 2004 the Lord Chancellor exercised his powers under the Access to Justice Act 1999Access to Justice Act 1999, ss.51-52/ Sch.3 to appoint a Legal Services Complaints Commissioner to regulate the society. In response to the commissioner's criticisms, in 2005, the Law Society divided its functions among the society, the Solicitors Regulation Authority and the Legal Complaints Service but by May 2006, the society's efforts to remedy its own deficiencies were still giving concern to the commissioner.Legal Services Complaints Commissioner (2006) p.6 As a result, a penalty of ¬£220,000 was levied.Legal Services Complaints Commissioner (2007) p.7 The commissioner subsequently recognised that progress was being made and on 22 February 2007, the service came into being. In April 2007, the commissioner advised the society that their Complaints Handling Plan adequately addressed the concerns. However, in April 2008, the commissioner reported that \\"Results show that despite some improvements in all target areas set, there are still failures ... to consistently apply their policies, processes and customer standards.\\"Legal Services Complaints Commissioner (2008) p.13 On 3 June 2008, the commissioner fined the Law Society ¬£275,000 over the inadequacy of its complaints handling plan for the forthcoming year. The Service The Service was a complaints-handling body, quasi-independent of the Society. It was part of the Law Society, but operated independently. The services offered to consumers were confidential and free at the point of use, the profession having rejected the idea of charging a flat fee as do some other professional complaints services, for example, that of architects. Where a complaint was upheld the firm complained of may have been required to make a contribution to the costs incurred by the Service in dealing with the complaint. Each case was said to have been looked at impartially, the Service working to find a solution acceptable to everyone concerned, including the lawyer. The Service's Chief Executive, Deborah Evans, said: The Service and Chief Executive are both steered by the Board for the Legal Complaints Service, chaired by Shamit Saggar. Further criticism and reform Chief Executive Evans was criticised as actively-seeking complaints about solicitors and as showing an excess of zeal in making work for her organisation in a bid to attract more funding. Complaints handling was further criticised in Sir David Clementi's 2004 report into regulation of legal services. When the Legal Services Act 2007 fully came into force, the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner was abolished and replaced with an Office for Legal Complaints which supervises the complaints-handling of solicitors, barristers and other legal professionals.Legal Services Act 2007, ss.114-159/ Sch.15 ReferencesBibliography  External links Legal ethics Organizations established in 2007 Legal organisations based in England and Wales Consumer protection in the United Kingdom Solicitors 2007 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Legal Complaints Service"},{"id":"9608002","text":"Edson Luiz da Silva (born 15 March 1977) is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as left-back, who could also adapt to play in midfield.

Leaves vary, they may be needle-like or flat and sometimes forked, curved or straight ending in a sharp point between long. Smooth woody fruit are either egg-shaped or elliptic long and wide. Taxonomy and naming The species was first described in 1868 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the specific epithet orthorrhyncha which is derived from the Greek orthos \\"straight\\" and rhynchos \\"beak\\" alluding to the straight beak on the seed capsules. The common name, bird beak hakea, is presumed to be a confusion between the Greek words for straight and bird. There are two varieties of the species, based on differing foliage characteristics: * Hakea orthorrhyncha var. filiformis F.Muell. ex Benth. has a spreading rounded growth habit to high, finely textured needle-like dark green leaves often divided up to long with a groove on the underside of the leaf.

A membership of approximately 39,000 (as of December 2015) dictates the Bank's policies and direction. The Board of Directors is elected annually by members, who are each allowed only one share in the bank. JAK Members Bank does not offer any interest on saved money. All of the bank's activities occur outside of the capital market as its loans are financed solely by member savings. Administrative and developmental costs are paid for by membership and loans. JAK banking employs the \\"Saving Points\\" system: members accumulate Saving Points during saving periods and use them when applying for a loan. The concept is that one is allowed to take out a loan for oneself to the same extent as one allows other people to be granted loans, saving into one's account. For this reason (applying for a loan), earned Saving Points must be equal to spent Saving Points to ensure sustainability. If a member is borrowing more saving points than they currently possess, they are obliged to continue accumulating \\"aftersavings\\" during the repayment period. Aftersavings are a fixed quota of money that a member must save after one's loan was made, so they can continue to earn Saving Points. This way, at the end of the repayment period, Saving Points earned will be equal to Saving Points spent, and at that time they will be able to have back all their aftersavings. JAK also offers a couple of loans where you do not need any saving points. History The co-operative society Jord Arbejde Kapital was founded in Denmark during the Great Depression in 1931. The society issued a popular local currency which was subsequently outlawed by the Danish government in 1933. In 1934 it founded an interest-free savings and loan system and a Local Exchange Trading System. Though both systems were forced to close, the savings and loan system re-emerged in 1944. The experience of JAK-banking in Denmark inspired a group in Sweden to develop a non-profit organisation named Jord Arbete Kapital - Riksf√∂rening f√∂r Ekonomisk Frig√∂relse (National Association for Economic Emancipation) in 1965. This pioneers' group developed a mathematical system based on Saving Points, designated the \\"balanced saving system\\". The association grew slowly at first. In 1997, a legislative amendment required the association to receive a banking license from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority in order to continue operating as a financial institution, which was granted in that year. The bank's deposits are insured by the government. Philosophy According to JAK's philosophy, economic instability arises out of and is a consequence of the levying of interest. JAK operates under the following principles: * Interest moves money from the poor to the rich * Interest favours projects which yield high profits in the short term The main aim of the bank is to provide its members with a viable, feasible financial instrument, sustainable for the environment and serving the local economy. Membership Marketing for JAK is done primarily by volunteers and word-of-mouth advertising. Deposits are accepted and loans are given in Swedish Krona (SEK). Mortgages or personal guarantees may be made only if the property or the guarantor is Swedish. It is compulsory to have Swedish residency to apply for a loan from JAK. The savings of members are covered under the deposit guarantees of the Swedish banking system. JAK in other countries JAK organisations exist in Denmark, Germany and Italy, in addition to Sweden. There was also an earlier attempt to start such a bank in Norway. The Danish organisations, which date back to 1931, are known as J.A.K. Andelskasser, and there are 14 independent organisations which hold the legal status of andelskasse, which is a form of bank in Denmark. They are all members of Landsforeningen J.A.K., the association of JAK organisations.

The house has an entrance designed by Thomas Hopper and interiors by James Wyatt. It is surrounded by of parkland, which includes a crescent-shaped lake covering . The parkland is Grade II listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. History The original Tudor house, owned by the Napier family, was largely destroyed in an accidental fire in 1742 and was rebuilt by John Bastard of Blandford and Francis Cartwright for Sir William Napier.John Cornforth notes payments, starting in 1744, to Bastard and also to Francis Cartwright (Cornforth, \\"The Building of Crichel\\" Architectural History 27, Design and Practice in British Architecture: Studies in Architectural History Presented to Howard Colvin [1984], pp. 268-269). Humphrey Sturt, of Horton, in Dorset, acquired the estate in 1765 on his marriage with Diana, the aunt and heir of Sir Gerard Napier, the 6th and last baronet and extensively remodelled the house. The Bastard family collaborated to enlarge the shell of Crichel in 1771-73; the new interiors were designed by James Wyatt (1772‚Äì80), with painted decor by Biagio Rebecca, chimneypieces by John Devall, and furniture by John Linnell (1778‚Äì79) and Ince and Mayhew (1768‚Äì78).Cornforth 1984 noted payments to Wyatt 1772-80, \\"R. Biagio\\" 1776, J. Devall, Linnell and Ince and Mayhew. Further construction in the 19th century included an entrance designed by Thomas Hopper in 1831, and alterations by William Burn,.Colvin, 1995 sub \\"William Burn\\", \\"Thomas Hopper\\". A wing on the north side of the house was demolished in the 20th century, when many country houses were reduced in size. From 1946 to 1961, Crichel House was the home of Cranborne Chase School, a boarding independent school for girls, which relocated to New Wardour Castle, near Tisbury in Wiltshire. Ownership The Crichel Estate is notable for the Crichel Down Affair, where the owners, Toby and Mary Anna Marten took on the Government and won the right to buy back land bought by compulsory purchase. The house and estate is part owned by the Marten family, direct descendants in the female line of the 3rd and last Baron Allington. Other landowners with an interest in the estate are Richard Chilton and the Phillimore family.  Relocation of Moor Crichel  The remodelling by Humphrey Sturt involved moving the village of Moor Crichel a mile to the south and many of the villagers were moved to Witchampton. This was so that the parkland could be landscaped and the original site of Moor Crichel is now submerged beneath the lake. Humphrey Sturt stopped short of moving St Mary's Church, which remains today.  Notable residents  George IV, while Prince Regent, stayed at Crichel House. Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales, the only child of his loveless marriage with Caroline of Brunswick, made Crichel House her home for a time under the care of Lady Rosslyn and Lady Ilchester.

D. Richardson, 'Mitchell, David Scott (1836‚Äì1907)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 5, Melbourne University Press, 1974, pp 260‚Äì261. Retrieved 8 October 2009. Early life Mitchell was born in Sydney, the son of Dr James Mitchell and his wife Augusta Maria Frederick, n√©e Scott. James Mitchell came to Australia in 1821 as an army surgeon, and two years later was appointed assistant surgeon at the military hospital, Macquarie Street, Sydney, of which he became head in 1825. James Mitchell afterwards became the owner of 50,000 acres (200 km¬≤) in the Hunter River valley which included rich coal-bearing land. James and Augusta are commemorated by a window in the Garrison Church. David Mitchell was born at Sydney Hospital, grew up in Cumberland Street, Sydney and in October 1852, aged 16, became one of the first seven undergraduate students in the newly established University of Sydney in 1852. Mitchell won scholarships in mathematics and graduated B.A. in 1856 with honours in classics, and M.A. in 1859. Mitchell was called to the bar but did not practise law or any other profession. It was said that he declined the position of attorney-general. Mitchell assisted in the management of the Hunter River estates. Mitchell was a good cricketer and dancer, a skilful whist player, and a good amateur actor. Allegedly, he broke off a romance with Emily Matilda Manning, daughter of William Montagu Manning. Mitchell was already forming a collection of books. Mitchell's father died in 1869 and there was a lawsuit over the will. Publication of the family affairs was humiliating to a man of Mitchell's sensitive disposition. Book collector Mitchell's lorgnette spectacles Mitchell was affected by the death of his mother greatly and began to withdraw from the world; his health was never robust. The formation of his library became his chief interest. He began to build up a fine library of English literature, specialising in poetry and sixteenth and seventeenth century books. In 1866, perhaps on the encouragement of George Robertson of Angus & Robertson, he began to collect early Australian books and manuscripts. In his search for books he was \\"largely indebted to the efforts of booksellers who knew Australiana, including George Robertson, Fred W. Wymark, William Dymock and James R. Tyrrell\\".Geoffrey Chapman Ingleton, \\"Australiana\\", in: The Australian Encyclopedia, The Grolier Society of Australia, 1963, Vol. 1, p. 340. Once a week, he went the round of the bookshops; by now, book collecting had become all-consuming. Mitchell had a good memory and discrimination, but as time went on he saw that even the most obscure and apparently worthless pamphlet might throw some light on its time. Though withdrawn from society, he welcomed genuine students such as Arthur Wilberforce Jose and Bertram Stevens, especially if they were interested in Australian problems. Mitchell also purchased books from other collectors, most notably Mitchell purchased the 3,300-volume Australian collection of Alfred Lee in 1906. Mitchell's grave at Rookwood Cemetery Library foundation Mitchell was anxious that the (then) colony of New South Wales might have the benefit of his collections. Eventually, after a conference with the Sydney public librarian, he informed the trustees on 17 October 1898 that he was willing to bequeath his collection to the library, if a suitable building were provided and if the books would be available to students. The offer was accepted. However, there was a long delay in starting a building and Mitchell suggested that the bequest would be cancelled if the books were not housed a year after the owner's death. In June 1905, the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Carruthers, instructed the government architect to prepare designs for a library and the work was begun early in 1906. Mitchell died on 24 July 1907 and his entire collection became the property of the state. Additionally, a sum of ¬£70,000 was bequeathed, the income from which has been spent in adding to the collection. Other activities Mitchell was the first patron of the Royal Australian Historical Society in 1901. Later life, death and legacy Mitchell's reclusiveness did not allow him to agree to having his portrait painted. The portrait prefixed to the centenary volume was painted from a photograph, after his death. He would never be interviewed and his kindliness was only known to a few students. He did not marry, but was glad to think that the library would be a permanent memorial of his family. Mitchell was buried in Rookwood Cemetery. In 1936, the centenary of Mitchell's birth, the trustees of the Public Library of New South Wales published The Mitchell Library, Sydney, Historical and Descriptive Notes. Written by the librarian Miss Ida Leeson, this publication describes some of the original manuscripts and books that may be found in the library. Further reading James R.

Atpadi is located north-east of Sangli District and shares borders with the adjacent Solapur and Satara Districts. The town has a taluka administrative office (that is, a Panchayat samiti local government body), a courthouse, a police station, a government-run primary hospital, various schools and colleges and a theater. Atpadi's economy is based on the cultivation and sale of agricultural products, with pomegranates and cotton constituting the core of the industry. The town is also home to the Manganga Sahakari Sugar factory, a Pomegranate auction center and various small scale industries in fields such as manufacturing, processing, servicing and repairs. The town can also lay claim to a literary connection, with four prominent Marathi authors originating from Atpadi. History The history of Atpadi before the 15th/16th century is not documented. Some editions of the Stahala Purana mention the town Atpade (‡§Ö‡§ü‡§™‡§°‡•á), but the date of the writing is undocumented. In historic times, Atpadi was part of the Manank yadav kingdom of Mandesh, ruled from the nearby village of Devapur. In the 16th century Atapdi was part of the Adilshahi kingdom of Bijapur. Later in the 19th century it became part of the princely state of Aundh as well as a palace city, hence it was called Atpadi Mahal. After Indian independence and the merging of Aundh into the Republic of India, Atpadi was in Khanapur Taluka in the Satara district till the new district Sangli was formed. After the formation of the new district, Atpadi was separated from Khanapur Taluka and made an administrative division (Taluka). Prominent Marathi writers like the late G.D.Madgulkar (‡§ó‡§¶‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ), the late Vyankatesh Madgulkar, the late Shankar Rao Kharat, the late N.S. Inamdar, the late Arun Kamble and the former petroleum minister of India, Ram Naik were from Atpadi.

They lack commercial markets or higher education schools. The surrounding areas depend on the Atpadi town for trading agricultural produce and for education. Their proximity to the town area, the expansion of the town with a growing population, infrastructural needs and well connected roads are making surrounding areas become part of the town. *Bhingewadi: Bhingewadi is a small Grampanchat Village located 3 kilometers to the north-west of the Atpadi Town. Bhingewadi is populated mostly by farmers whose surname is Bhinge, thus the name Bhingewadi. Bhingewadi is a small village of 2000 people with much farmland. Wheat, Jowar, Bajara, and pomegranate are the main produce from the farmlands. It is adjacent to Swatantrapur. *Bombewadi: Located on the East Side of Atpadi City *Awalai: Situated in between Dinghachi village and Atpadi slightly near to village Nimbawade. *Deshmukhwaadi: Situated to the east of Atpadi *Yamaji Patalachi Wadi: Located on the Atpadi-Sangola road *Mapate Mala: Located on the Atpad-Nimbawade road to the north-west *Sonarsiddhnagar: Located on the Atpadi-Kouthuli road.

The late Prof. Arun Kamble, a prominent Marathi writer, was born in Atpadi Taluka. The Marathi book, 'Mandeshi Manase' (People of Mandesh), written by Venkatesh Madgulkar, is based on characters in Atpadi and is set in Atpadi and its surrounding areas. The autobiography of Shankar Rao Kharat Taral-Antaral has a detailed chapter on Atpadi before the independence of India. *MaanDarshan: A magazine published from Atpadi. *Vyatha Pinjryatil Pakhranchya: Kavi Shriram Anuse who is the Mandeshi poet. *Punha Ek Navi Disha: Author Nitinraje Anuse whose full name is Nitin Machhindra Anuse.

Agriculture and cattle *Agriculture: Jowar, maize, wheat, cotton, sugarcane, bajari and pomegranate are the main agricultural produce in Atpadi. Pomegranate plantations are quite new and modern irrigation techniques, like drip irrigation, have helped local farmers to grow pomegranate fields. Being an export product to Middle-East and Arab nations, pomegranate has given higher yields to farmers than traditional crop- based farming. The low monsoon rainfall is advantageous to farmers as the pomegranate is a desert tree. *Khillari bull (Atpadi Mahal)- The breed is well adapted to the tropical and drought prone conditions present in this part of the world and are favoured by the local farming community due to their ability to handle the hardships of farming pretty well. *Buffalo, sheep and goat are also raised.

He won two All-Ireland medals with Meath in 1987 and 1988 and has also won two All Star awards. He won the Meath Senior Football Championship with Summerhill in 1986. He has generally played at the full-back position for his county. Early life Lyons is from Summerhill, Co. Meath, an area close to the Kildare border. His grandfather Captain Pat Giles was a long serving TD for Meath. His father Paddy actually played against Meath in the 1949 Leinster Championship for Kildare. On the Meath team of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mick played alongside his brother Paraic (corner back) & cousin Liam Harnan (centre back). He is also a cousin of another Meath football great, Trevor Giles. Playing career=Meath Lyons made his Championship debut for Meath in 1979 against Kilkenny, playing at centre back. He became well known playing full back for Meath, following other notable Meath full backs Tommy \\"The Boiler\\" McGuiness, Paddy O'Brien and Jack Quinn. He was one of the central figures of Se√°n Boylan's All Ireland winning Meath teams of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Legend has it that on Se√°n Boylan's first training sessions as Meath Manager, Lyons told Boylan to \\"put your shyness in your a*se pocket.\\" Lyons won two Senior All Ireland medals in 1987 and 1988, captaining the team in 1987 (Meath's first win for 20 years), as well as five Leinster medals and two National League medals. He also played on the Meath teams which lost the All Ireland finals of 1990 and 1991. In 1984 he was part of the Meath team which won the Centenary Cup, a competition which was contested to celebrate the GAA's 100 year anniversary. He has won two All Star awards for the full back position in 1984 and 1986. Surprisingly, despite enjoying most of his success after 1986, he failed to get another All Star. Some put this down to his reputation as a \\"hard man\\" on the football pitch. During Lyons' playing career, Meath's greatest rivals were Dublin and Cork. Meath played Dublin in the Leinster Championship most seasons, including four times alone in the famous saga of 1991, and played Cork in the All Ireland finals of 1987, 1988 (where the final went to a replay) and 1990. He retired from the Meath Senior team in 1992 after Meath suffered a surprise defeat to Laois. This marked the end of an era in Meath football with many older players not featuring on the Meath team again. Lyons later served as one of Se√°n Boylan's selectors of the Meath Team in 1994 and 1995. In the last game of Meath's four game saga with Dublin in 1991, Dublin were awarded a penalty, which Keith Barr took. Lyons ran alongside Barr while he was taking the penalty, and Barr missed. The penalty was never retaken as it should have been. This incident got much coverage at the time and led to GAA changing the official pitch markings to include a semi circle exclusion zone around where a player takes a penalty from. No players other than the penalty taker are allowed inside this zone while the penalty is being taken. During Lyons' career, injuries have had an impact. Hopes were very high for Meath for the 1984 season; in 1983 Meath had run Dublin, the eventual All Ireland Champions, very close, being beaten in extra time in a replay and they had won the Centenary Cup at the start of 1984. Meath were geared up for the Dublin game in 1984, but Lyons was missing due to injury (broken wrist) and Meath went on to lose. Again in 1989 Meath faced Dublin without Lyons. He had broken his leg playing club football and missed the season. Meath lost to Dublin and their \\"three in a row\\" All Ireland dreams were gone. Between 1984 and 1991, Dublin and Meath met in the championship eight times, of which Dublin won twice. Both of these times Lyons was injured, and in all the remaining he was guarding the square. In the 1991 All Ireland final Lyons had to leave the field with a knee injury, his injury compounding an injury crisis for Meath that day. Meath lost the final to Down. Compromise Rules During his Meath career, Lyons was picked to play in the first three Test Series (1984, 1986 and 1987) for Ireland in Compromise Rules. In the first Compromise Rules match (First Test, 1984 Series) to be played he had to be taken from the field after a tackle from an Aussie rules player. In subsequent matches he was involved in several disagreements with Australian players. Post playing career In recent years, Lyons and his cousin Austin Lyons have been involved in developing Rathcore Golf & Country Club in Co. Meath.

It was built by the Order of St. John between 1757 and 1760, on the site of an earlier courthouse which had been built in 1572. The building was built in the Baroque style to design of the architect Francesco Zerafa, and completed by Giuseppe Bonici. It is a prominent building in Merchants Street, having an ornate fa√ßade with an elaborate marble centrepiece. Features of the interior include former court halls, a chapel, prison cells, a statue of Lady Justice at the main staircase and an ornate fountain in the courtyard. From the late 18th to the early 19th century, the building was also known by a number of names, including the Palazzo del Tribunale, the Palais de Justice and the Gran Corte della Valletta. By the mid-19th century the building was deemed too small, and the courts were gradually moved to Auberge d'Auvergne between 1840 and 1853. The Castellania was then abandoned, before being briefly converted into an exhibition centre, a tenant house and a school. In 1895, the building was converted into the head office of the Public Health Department. The department was eventually succeeded by Malta's health ministry which is still housed in the Castellania. The building's ground floor contains a number of shops, while the belongings of Sir Themistocles Zammit's laboratory are now housed at the second floor and is open to the public by appointment as The Brucellosis Museum. History=Institution The Magna Curia Castellania (; ), was the courts and tribunals during the rule of the Order of St. John. The institution was founded for the first time in Palestine in 1186, then established in Rhodes when it became known as Pragmatic√¶ Rhodi√¶, and remained active there until the expulsion of the Order from the island in 1522. The institution was established in Malta after the arrival of the Order on 5 September 1533, during the magistracy of Grandmaster Philippe de L'Isle-Adam and it is sometimes distinguishably known as the Magn√¶ Curi√¶ Ca≈øtellani√¶ Meliten≈øis. It was among the first institutions that was found to require reforms. Johannes Quintinus was given responsibility to prepare the first set of laws for Malta, which were later established by the Grand Master. The institution followed the Sicilian legal system, known as the Ritus Magn√¶ Curi√¶ Sicili√¶. It was headed by a Castellan, also known as the President of the Castellania, who was a knight of the Order. He was ceremonially always followed by a page boy carrying a rod on a cushion when walking in public, with the rod symbolising his position, earning him the nickname captain of the rod. Composition The institution included two judges, one for the civil court and one for the criminal court. In the same building were the Office and Court of Appeals. The judges of the Castellania were native Maltese and dealt with cases that took place in the district of Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities. Other districts, such as those under the courts of Mdina and Rabat, followed the same model and had to adopt decisions taken at the Castellania. On three days per week, the Fiscal Prosecutor brought cases before the judges. A Head Notary liaised for decisions taken by the institution. There was a Cancelliere, who was responsible for receiving and preserving judicial acts, registering the sentences meted out by the judges and supervising the other workers in the courts. There was a Gran Visconte (the Chief of police) who coordinated the police, and the Capitani di notte who implemented the sentences. Other workers included an official who saw that prisoners were treated fairly, those who were responsible for the archives and advocates for legal aid. ‚Äì Translation. Advocates were generally Italian-speaking Maltese, as most knights and foreigners considered the position as for the inferior people. A report was drafted weekly and sent to the palace of the Grand Master, informing about occurrences presented to the Castellania. The Castellania was the supreme court of justice of the islands, hence called Gran Corte or the variants in legal documents. The Grand Master had the absolute power to preside over the institution. The Papacy quarreled for a superior decision, such as when there was conflict with the court of the Bishop, but citing sovereignty of the princely Grand Master it was never conceded. The Castellania originally had decision over every aspect of life, including public morality and religion, but having the Islands been visited by an official of the Holy See in the 16th century and found lack of enforcement by the knights in religious aspects, the Inquisition was established. With the presence of the Inquisition, the Holy See considered Malta similar to a colony, but through the Castellania the Order kept rigid control and sovereignty over Malta. Though the Inquisition had the power to issue a death penalty in cases related to religion, such as heresy, fornication and sodomy, it generally left it at the discretion of the Castellania. Religious monks, including the Bishop of Malta, were not to be subject of decisions taken by the Castellania but there were instances of having to make exceptions as per offense to the state. In the late eighteenth century, under Grand Master de Rohan, Giovanni Nicolo‚Äô Muscat has trigerred significant controversy over his views on church-state separation in matters which are not religious in nature. In its time, the Castellania was considered to be a secular court. Cases generally consisted of secular parties, with secular accusations, for cases of secular nature. Officially it treated people with more equity; religious courts in Malta under Roman Catholicism would refer to non-Christians and people with diverse abilities as creatures, because of their \\"imperfection\\", whereas the Castellania considered all people as humans. However the Castellania distinguished the non-Christians by considering all others as aliens, of which difference also has had negative impact in terms of equality before the law, and in practice it was still theocratic. Women had same rights as men to institute for court action. In military context the knights were not subject to the Castellania, and were instead prosecuted at the Military Tribunal (Tribunale Militare), however it received assistance from the higher hierarchy of the Castellania such as from the judge of the criminal court. The law was amended with the issue of a Bando by the Grand Master. Particular bandi regulated the procedures of medicating a seriously wounded person, where the Castellania had to be informed by medical practitioners within less then a day from the assistance. From Birgu to Valletta The courts and tribunals were initially housed in a building in Birgu. After the Order moved their headquarters to Valletta, the Castellania moved as well. The Castellania building in Birgu was handed to the Inquisition for free. In Valletta, it was initially housed inconveniently in Strada Stretta, at the back of the Treasury of the Order, in a building belonging to Bailiff Bandinelli. It was sometimes known as baglio, an Italian architectural reference to courthouses, or Tribunale della Giustizzia. Grand Master Jean de la Cassi√®re bought the present site of the Castellania in Valletta for the courts to have an adequate location. Meanwhile, the original Castellania in Birgu was converted into the Inquisitor's Palace in 1574. The building of a Castellania was made in the original plans of Valletta. Republished in One of the plans for the Castellania was also to be built within the reserved area of the auberges of the knights, known as the Collacchio, but limiting access to a vast area in Valletta was found to be unpractical and the initiative was abandoned. The first purposely built Castellania in Valletta was built in 1572 by la Cassi√®re, and was likely designed by Girolamo Cassar, similar to other Valletta buildings of the late 16th century. The building had a military appearance, with the corners designed with massive quoins, typical of Cassar. Though the building had only one actual corner on St John Street crossing with the Square, the other ends touched the adjoining buildings. The Castellania made use of a bell, became popularly known as the ruffiana, to convey messages to the people and inform about an event. A chapel was located in the building for the spiritual services of prisoners. Similar to other prominent buildings, the Castellania was provided with water within its courtyard by connection to the Wignacourt Aqueduct. In 1646, Pierre Garsin was commissioned to execute works within the prison section of the first Castellania which constituted of works on the walls that were examined to be in a state close to collapse. People in prison were generally those awaiting trial by the Castellania, but also by the Inquisition. Regulated visits to captives were allowed. The building had a main front door which was used for official purposes such as by the Castellan of the Gran Corte della Castella. The Magistrato degli Almamenti or Tribunale degli Armamenti, founded by Grand Master Wignacourt, was initially housed in the first Castellania building but moved to a separate location during the rule of Grand Master Perellos, who had established the Consolato del Mare in 1697. The first Castellania of Valletta was demolished in the mid-18th century on orders of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, as he despised its austere architecture and wanted a symbolic building of his absolutism. Pinto continued on similar steps of his predecessor, Grand Master Wignacourt, by taking several initiatives and make stately projects, and a new Castellania was one of the main prospects. There are claims based on word of mouth that in the 18th century the courts and tribunals were housed at 254, St. Paul's Street (now known as Europe House, and occupied by the offices of the European Commission and the European Parliament), plausibly between 1757 and 1760, however this is considered as a hearsay. Construction Inscription commemorating the reconstruction of the Castellania Knights Giacomo de Blacas d'Aups and the Giorgio Valperga di Masino were given monopoly rights for four decades over the use of wind-power machines for the production of marble, metals, limestone and timber in Malta by Pinto in 1752. As a benefit of granting such license, Pinto secured the benefit that service for the construction of public and private projects would cost a quarter less than if handmade. The limestone used was from Misra(h) il-Barrieri in Santa Venera. A new Baroque building was constructed on site of the first Castellania, creating significant employment, with works commencing in 1757. Throughout the course of construction, prisoners were held in a tower near Valletta's Porta Reale, probably the tower of Saint James Cavalier. The new Castellania was built to a design by the architect Francesco Zerafa, but he died during its construction on 21 April 1758. His work was completed by then Engineer Giuseppe Bonici. Zerafa is accredited for the main design, and for the subjected building he has post mortem established himself as a respected architect. The edifice was completed in 1760, and saw the last finishes in October of that year, after which on 23 of that month was able to accommodate its intended functions. As a general rule, by the Officio delle Case (Officium Commissariorum Domorum), the buildings in Valletta were required to be ready within three-years period from start to completion. The Castellania was built in conformity with the Officio delle Case. The chapel was consecrated on 15 November of that year, which also marked the official inauguration. The main commemoration for the opening is an inscription above the central doorway which praises Grand Master Pinto for his achievement in rebuilding the courthouse. The prisoners were transferred to the new prison three days later, on 18 November 1760. Local hard limestone was used for construction, however the main portico was decorated with Carrara marble. Some of the marble used was cannibalized from the ruins of the Temple of Proserpina, an ancient Roman temple in Mtarfa which had been discovered in 1613. A craftsman who worked on the decorative sculpture of the Castellania's fa√ßade's central-piece and chapel was Maestro Giovanni Vito, the Puglisi (from P√πglia), a Neapolitan buonavoglia (a rower on the galleys). Journal. He would become the first man to be convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging in the new Castellania on 15 December 1760. With the remodelling of the edifice, Pinto has ubiquitous besprinkle his heraldic symbolic couchant crescents, in the interior and exterior of the architecture of the building, to convey a message of his absolutism and opulence. Sometimes after its completion, artist Tiepolo Favray took record of the notorious building. Disseminated information among European monarchies compared it to be of proportionate to the expectations of the most powerful nations. Courthouse During the 18th century, by hosting the courts and the tribunals, it was known as the Corte della Castellania (or the variants) and sometimes as the Palazzo del Tribunale. Journal archive. Among the common public was, however, simply known as the Court of the Grandmaster, probably to simply distinguish it from the courts of the inquisition and of the Bishop. Some judges of the Castellania, such as Vincenzo Bonavita (1752-1829), served during four different periods being the Order of St John, the French Republic, during the British Protectorate and the under the British Empire. The locals preferred to be subjected to the Court of the Bishop or the Inquisition, rather than Castellania. Order of St John Interior of the Castellania Civil and criminal cases commenced after its completion, as was intended. Court sittings already started to be heard at the remodeled Castellania prior its inauguration. Conflict between the court of the Grand Master and that the court of the Bishop was a common issue during the reign of Pinto. The Bishop of Malta continuously lobbied against sentences by the Castellania when the accused is a monk. Several instances went as far as Rome to be settled. Pinto believed that it was justified to take a decision when state interest is threatened. Homosexual practice was punishable by death by the Castellania. In an uncommon case heard in 1774 was when an intersex person, 17-year-old Rosaria \\"Rosa\\" Mifsud, a.k.a. Primitiva, from Luqa petitioned for a sex change to wear as a man, instead of the female clothing worn ever since born. Two medical experts were appointed by the court to perform an examination. This case gives detail of the use of experts in the field, similar to the late modern period. The examiners were the Physician-in- Chief and a senior surgeon, both working at the Sacra Infermeria. The Grandmaster took the decision for Mifsud to wear only men clothes from then on. The decision was taken to the court of appeals, which appointed other seven medical experts that agreed with the observations of the previous two experts. Following the Rising of the Priests in 1775, three of the rebellion's leaders were executed without receiving fair trial. The death penalty was signed by the Castellano under the orders of Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada. Prior to judgement, some of the rebellions were locked up in the secretive prisons near the courtroom of the Castallania, some at the Castellania dungeons, and in other Valletta buildings. All those arrested were recorded on the Libro del Carcerati Della Magna Curia Castellania. Among them was Gaetano Mannarino, the leader of the rebellion. Some of them were condemned to death by strangulation in the dungeons of the Castellania. The whole process went against the conformity of the courts in Malta as the priests were not to be subjected to the Castellania but to the court of the Bishop. However the Inquisition had already determined in previous decision- making that crimes of serious nature were not to have ecclesiastical immunity from criminal prosecution at the Castellania. Some sources say that only the laymen were prosecuted at the Castellania, while the priests were tried at Fort St Elmo. Ximenes died a natural death within weeks after the sentences, with some locals believing it was a divine providence for his merciless judgement against the clergy. In 1777, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc introduced the Supremum Justiti√¶ Magistratum (Collegiate Tribunal of the Jury's Supreme Magistrate) in order to establish more separation of powers in judicial decisions. Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan to address issues related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law book to be used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicol√≥ Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to challenge it and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations.Bonello (2000), v. 1, p. 160. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, a humane set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal approach. It also set standard regulations for advocates, with some flexibility. It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Code de Rohan clarified the role and powers of the \\"Giudice Criminale della Gran Corte della Castellania\\". It gave judges the right to decide on cases presented before them, instruct for investigations of serious nature, conduct inquiries, take action as themed necessarily.Diritto Municipale di Malta, Libro 1, Capo III, Para. Vet seq. in . The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a more lenient Criminal Code. During his magistracy, Grand Master de Rohan sentenced the Castellan, allegedly for practicing conflict of interest considering his position, to a life in prison but was allowed to escape and lived in exile. Giuseppe Elia Pace, an advocate and close friend of Mikiel Anton Vassalli, was found guilty of treason during the reign of de Rohan and was sentenced for flogging in Valletta followed by a permanent exile out of Malta. in Vassalli was imprisoned at the Klistanija at the end of the rule of the Order of St. John, and was accused of plotting revolutionary ideas during the magistracy of Grand Master Hompesch. Vassalli denied the accusations and remained imprisoned. Meanwhile, he received visits from the father of Fortunato Panzavecchia. While dining together around a table with prison guards, Panzavecchia took notes from conversations he had with Vassalli. These notes shed more light on the life of Vassalli, who after his death became the national Maltese linguistic. Though given a life sentence, he either managed to escape or was released after the expulsion of the Order from Malta. French Republic Malta was invaded by the French First Republic in June 1798, and the Order was expelled from the island, resulting in the French occupation of Malta. Grand Master Hompesch was pressured to capitulate, as the Maltese nobility and the Magistrate of the Castellania, together with influential and high ranking figures made it clear to the Fiscal of the Castellania that, unless he surrenders, those resisting the French would have to simultaneously face an internal revolution. The French reformed the legal system with the country being divided into provinces for roughly each 3,000 inhabitants, all with their own civil and criminal jurisdiction for the Justice of Peace: this included the use of the Castellania. Corporal punishment, which was leniently used at the end of the rule of the Order of St John, was officially abolished by the French. Religious figures, such as Franciscan Prelate Monsignor Axisa, were prosecuted at the Castellania and also kept there under arrest if required. Alt URL The institution of the Castellania was replaced by the Tribunale Provisorio and the Tribunale Civile di Prim'Instanza. The post of Castellano was abolished, and judges were nominated by the Commission de Gouvernement. By 6 July public buildings in Valletta were renamed, with the Castellania renamed as Palais de Justice. The creation of the newly introduced court in Malta according to republican ideals, on 16 July 1798, saw the abolition of the Order's Courts and Tribunals together with the abolition of the Courts of the Bishop and the Inquisition. Giovanni N. Muscat was made a judge and president of the court during the French period but was soon dismissed bynthe French. Not less than three full cases of silver secured at the Castellania, were taken by the French on 8 November 1798, and were melted to create coins to remunerate the Jacobins. It was one of a series of similar reasons that consequently triggered a Maltese revolt. The French law system did not last enough to influence the Maltese courts at the time. British protectorate After a successful Maltese uprising against French rule, in 1800 Malta became a British protectorate, with the Castellania becoming known as the Gran Corte della Valletta. It was amongst the first public institutions to be reestablished. The documents of the Tribunale della Gran Corte della Castellania were given by Government Alexander Ball to the Gran Corte Vescovile (Court of the Bishop) with other documents of the church and the Inquisition at the request of the ecclesiastic authorities. Apart from those of the Court of the Bishop, the others (including those of the Castellania) were all found to be irrelevant to the church and were transferred to the Palace of the Inquisition in Birgu. The documents of the Tribunale della Valletta were likely transferred to the palace of the Inquisition by mistake but those arriving there never saw their way back to Valletta since. On 8 March 1805, a proclamation declared the restoration of the Courts of Justice. In February 1806, Ball gave instructions to presumably guarantee independence of the Judiciary, whereas the Judges could not be removed at a simple request, and legal persons would not be threatened to be jailed if they disagree with signing legal documents. At the request of the Maltese National Congress, the law was once again reformed to the ancient rights and the Code De Rohan. Vassalli was imprisoned again during the siege, and was kept at the Castellania from 16 September 1800 until he was exiled during the British Protectorate on 15 January 1801. While in jail at the Castellania, Vassalli read in Arabic, and vocally translated to Maltese, passages of the Quran to other inmates among him. The Quran, with a leather cover, was discovered when Vassalli had a spot check by the British in the whereabouts of Porta Reale. Between 1810 and 1811 most Valletta buildings were given addresses. The first address of the main door of the building was in Italian as istrada Mercanti, No.15, La Castellania. ƒ†ampatist Gatt was engaged with the Criminal Court as an interpreter and translator, to and from English, from 1 August 1810 to 30 June 1814. The death penalty was used during the British Protectorate and the decapitation of the body after execution remained in use by the Castellania. In the early 19th century the building housed the Maltese Vice-Admiral Court. It was founded in June 1803. John Stoddart (1773-1856) served as the first Advocate to the British monarchy from 1803 to 1807. By 1811, during the protectorate, this court was flagged as being abusive in its early stages of establishment. The conduct of this court has been raised in the British parliament. It was replaced by another court and abolished in the 1890s. Literature and objects related the Vice-Admiralty Court in Malta are now exhibited at the Malta Maritime Museum in Birgu. British colony Maltese courts became British subject on 5 October 1813, months before the Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony. Soon after, in 1813, Civil Commissioner Alexander Ball terminated and transferred the judicial power of the Corte Capitanale of Mdina to the Castellania in Valletta. Similar to other public buildings, the Castellania was closed down during the plague outbreak of 1813‚Äì14, and it was only used for emergency cases relating to the plague itself. Two people were sentenced to death for not revealing themselves of being infected of plaque to relevant authorities and putting at risk the people around them. Both were fired by squad to death outside the courthouse in the street. When the plague ended, the Castellania was once again used as a courthouse and gaol for accused who were still awaiting trial. Under Governor Thomas Maitland, the British adopted a codification of a mixed system of Civil Law, which included Roman Law, Code Napol√©on and continental law. Crown Advocate Adrian Dingli was trusted with the task of reforms. These reforms remain the basic of Maltese law today. By 1814 all forms of torture were abolished, however any freedom possibly leading to a revolt could be suppressed with physical force. In 1814, the College of Auditors (Segnatura) was abolished and was replaced by the Supreme Council of Justice. The purpose of this reform was to see more equity at law at a time when the governor observed that there were questionable judicial cases, and thus gave an opportunity for review. The Government Gazette started to report prominent cases of the court after the visit of the Commissioners Austin and Lewis. Language Tuscan Italian, and to some extant Latin, was used as the main functioning language of the courts throughout the periods of the knights, French occupation, British periods, until at least 1879 when the courts had already moved out of the building. Though Maltese has always remained in use throughout the Knights period among all classes of society, the Councillor of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice Francesco Saverio Farrugia implied that Italian was considered as the maternal language which connects the country with the rest of Europe. The French language was established as the sole official language during the French occupation, however an exception was given to the courts as Italian prevailed for legal jargon. Journal archive Efforts by the British to use English during the protectorate and the early colonisation of Malta failed, mostly due to the resistance by the minority educated class. The supreme court proceedings were suggested to take place with the use of English, to encourage the study and use of English by judges and lawyers, but the efforts were futile. Both during the French occupation and English period, the supreme court decisions were published in Italian and the other preferred language of the government; French during the French period and English during the British periods. The Maltese language was never discussed to be used at the courts, when housed in the Castellania. However, some documents presented to the courts were sometimes written with Italian and a mix of Sicilian or Maltese words. The language question was not solved until the 20th century, when the building had for long changed purpose. Prison A prison cell in the Castellania Apart from a courthouse, the Castellania also served as a prison where suspects and convicts were imprisoned. The entrance of the former prison from St John Street and is locally known as Prisoner's Street (Triq il-Kalzrati) or Hook's Street (Triq il-Ganc). Serious criminal offenders from Gozo would be taken to the court in Gozo, and on the decision of the administrative Castellan would be sent to a temporarily prison in Fort Chambray, before traveling by sea to Valletta and kept locked at the Castellania until his case is heard. It was common to restrain political prisoners by locking them in the secure prison of the Castellania during the magistracy of the Order of St John. Prisoners not awaiting trial were allowed to have visits from non-inmates every day. Prisonors could be sentenced to row on the galleys and for a lifetime exile as far as Australia, such was the case in June 1790 of John Pace. The British used to arrest males dressing as women during carnival celebrations despite being a normal custom, and those caught by police were held overnight at the Castellania for gender conformity reeducation. On 15 March 1849, Lorenzo Bonello was assigned by the Governor to give service as the \\"Keeper of the Castellania\\" at of the prison. The prison was permanently closed and moved to the \\"Palace of the Courts of Justice\\" in 1853. Lorenzo Aguis, a public official working as a porter, was catering for the prison before and after it became vacant. Other uses While the Castellania was in use as a courthouse and a prison, parts of the building were also used for a number of other purposes. The Castellan resided in an apartment in the same Castellania. The building hosted the Chamber of Commerce and the sittings of the Consulato del Mare in the eighteenth century, which were next to each other. It also housed the Monte di Sant'Anna until 1773, a decision taken by Grand Master Ximenes. Individuals or groups could petition at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing a license to perform their occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed the largest number of clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues. Clerks were not required to be Maltese, but had to be fluent in Italian which appealed to Sicilians. Sea vessels were required by law to register at the Castellania to operate in Maltese waters and each had to pay a minimum ten grani, depending on the size of the vessel and its purpose. With the Registri Patentarum, the Castellania issued legal patents for galleys to travel from the port of Valletta to other ports and vice versa. The patents gave details subject to health inspections which included the names of the merchants and the description of the belongings for trade. Those galleys coming from non- European ports or from places subjected to possible disease were withheld in quarantine for days and only given permission to mix with the rest of the people once a Pratica was issued by the Commission of Public Health. The Clean Bill of Health continued to be issued and gradually reformed during the British period, under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer. The Castellania imposed a charge for those not having health assurance and having to lodge at the Lazzaretto. Titles of nobility were required to be recognized by the Cancelleria and then registered at the Castellania. Alt URL Each noble title was subject to review by the judges or the Castellan. Most services at the edifice of the Castellania, such as court cases and office work, were against payment which balanced the expenses of the institution. At any given point, the Castellania could request for the valuation of goods to determine facts. Francesco Rivarola, the commandant of the police, had his office of the Deputy Inspector General of Executive Police stationed within the Castellania since 1814 when Malta was gradually adapting as a British colony. The police office vacated the premises in the 19th century and was moved to the Palace of the Governor. As published on the Malta Government Gazette, on 21 October 1829, Malta saw the introduction of a jury system in cases related to murder.The Sunday Times of Malta - Newspaper Print Later and present use The building was no longer regarded as being adequate to function as a courthouse by 1840, during the Government of Sir Henry Bouverie, and that year the Civil Courts were moved to Auberge d'Auvergne. The courts of criminal jurisdiction and the office of the police were moved to the auberge in 1853. The police office fully moved out around 1860, as initial criminal proceedings were still addressed at the Castellania by that year.Castagna (1865), p. 102. Court archives and registrations documents of the Castellania were relocated for safekeeping in the auberge. Mess By a Governor Ordinance No. 11 of 5 May 1852 the Castellania had to be converted into a military mess for the Maltese Militia Force. It is known to have been occupied by the military stationed in Valletta and Floriana by at least 1854. Exhibition centre The building later housed an exhibition centre. Despite the efforts of originality in science subjects it failed to attract crowds to sustain it. Division into three parts It was eventually split into three parts a tenants living quarters () in the former prison, a Government High School for Girls in the former courthouse and the Gas Office in the former police office. The Malta and Mediterranean Company Limited terminated its operations with a parliamentary approval of the Gas Act of November 1952. The latter later served as the headquarters of the St. John Ambulance Association. In 1894, the Malta Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (established in 1852) housed a temporary exhibition at the Castellania. The building was considered ideal to showcase the works of the society by local artisans. However, Gerald Strickland handed the artisans society another building in St John Street opposite St John's Co-Cathedral, the Palazzo Xara (destroyed in WWII) so that the Castellania can be vacated for a more permanent use. *Expand section Department and Ministry for Health The Brucellosis Museum within the Castellania The building became the seat of the Chief Government Medical Officer in 1895. This took place on 10 April 1895, when Gerald Strickland transferred into the building the head office of the Public Health Department, which in 1937 combined them as the Medical and Health Department. Between 1904 and 1906, the Malta Fever Commission (MFC) worked in the Castallania, and on 14 June 1905 the physician Sir Themistocles Zammit discovered the cause behind the Mediterranean fever (known also by various names) while working there. The fever was first traced in Malta among British soldiers during the French occupation of Malta. In June 1904, during the experiments, Zammit learned that a Maltese family of five members became simultaneously ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats. Republished in He went on to purchase healthy goats and tested them, and at one point also kept them on the first floor of the Castellania (then known as the public health building or the variants). Zammit was successful in the discovery of the disease. Journal archive David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded in the discovery, Bruce tried to discredit Zammit by taking the merit for himself. Journal archive Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. The fever was renamed after Bruce, as brucellosis. The MFC managed to find cure and ways to eradicate the fever, but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers and consumers of milk; some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of infected animals continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995. Restoration in process in September 2017 The laboratory on the Castellania's second floor, intiailly used by the Malta Fever Commission, was restored and converted into The Brucellosis Museum in 1980, and it is now open to the public by appointment. During WWII, the Health Department dealt with several contagious illnesses attributed to the mass sharing of buildings and war shelters. The buildings close to the Castellania were hit by air bombings. The Castellania was damaged together with the next door Casa Dorell during one of the bombardments on 4 April 1942. The Castellania suffered damage on the side of the prison up to a fraction of the front fa√ßade. Since the British period some of the prison cells were modified and converted into government offices, and currently still serve this purpose. Other parts of the Castellania's interior, including the chapel and one of the prison cells, were restored in the 1990s. The restored cell appears on the front cover of the book Kissing the Gallows: A Cultural History of Crime, Torture and Punishment in Malta, 1600‚Äì1798, authored by William Zammit. There were further plans to restore the fa√ßade in the late 1990s, but nothing materialized. The fa√ßade was again restored as part of a number of projects for Valletta 2018 ‚Äì European Capital of Culture. Original language; A detailed study for the restoration of the fa√ßade took place, which gave the way to call for a public tender, and work began in June 2017. Works were completed in January 2018, in time for Valletta's inauguration as European Capital of Culture. Some sculpture of the fa√ßade have weathered or broke off during the years but were faithfully reconstructed during the restoration. The building appears in a late 19th century photo, when the section on St. John Street was used to house the gas office, as well as shops on Merchant's Street. The photo forms part of the Richard Ellis collection, a set of images named for the photographer. The building appears in an early 20th century photo, with the photograph named as Castellania (Old Court-House), and appears on a British period postcard. By the late 19th century, calesse drivers were required to register their vehicles at the Castellania and obtain number plates. In the early 20th century, socialist patriot Manwel Dimech was imprisoned by the British at the Castellania, unbeknownst to the public or his family, until a well planned forced exit from the country on 5 September 1914. This took him to exile, and he was never to return to Malta again. A plaque in the whereabouts of the Victoria Gate, where Dimech had to pass before boarding on a ship, commemorates the episode. The imprisonment of Dimech at the Castellania, and his exile abroad, is considered as a landmark injustice during the British period. The building housed Malta's Public Health Department (id-Dipartiment tas-Saƒßƒßa Pubblika) from 1921 to 1998. As a consequence of the given Self-Government (1921‚Äì1934) a number of high-profile health decisions were taken. It was later decided to house the Ministry for Health, which has been known by a number of names throughout the years. The Ministry has been operating at the Castellania, after moving out from Casa Leoni in Santa Venera, since 7 October 1998. Under the remit of the Health Ministry, there are now around 6,000 workers operating around the country. The ground floor hosts a number of shops which were intended in the original design to generate employment. The rest of the building is not normally open to the public, except for some special occasions such as the Notte Bianca event. The Richmond Foundation in Malta has used the Notte Bianca opportunity to disperse information about psychiatric conditions by setting a stand at the Castellania. Since the 1990s on the feast of Saint Luke, at the discretion and budget of the Ministry, a reception is held at the building were high ranking medical officials are invited for a gathering. On 10 November 1995, the participants of the Malta Lithium Symposium from 18 different nationalities were hosted at the Castellania by Minister for Social Development, Louis Galea, to meet with government employees of different ministries and departments. In 2007, Minister Austin Gatt suggested the establishment of a museum of Maltese legal and political history in the building, but to date this is yet to materialise. The Castellania serves as an authority for the permission of burials and the selling of government owned burial sites. Related to the matter, on 19 December 2017, numerous people were given an appointment on the same day which resulted in a crowding at the customer care section at the former prison's courtyard of the Castellania. Most clients were told to leave premises after being given another appointment. In December 2019, messages related to Government corruption in Malta and the death of Daphne Caruana Galizia were left attached to the door of the Castellania, together with symbolic coal on the doorstep.https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/activists-place-coal-on- ministries-doorstep-in-yuletide-protest.759269 Architecture It is common for prestigious buildings in Valletta, such as the Castellania, to be used as government ministries. The Castellania is regarded as an iconic building in Maltese architecture. It is a historical and architectural landmark in Valletta, a World Heritage Site city. The highly decorated building differs from other nearby buildings, to an extent that may lack harmony in the street which is in. Exterior The ornate marble centrepiece The Castellania is considered as the masterpiece of architecture projected by Grand Master Pinto, being the most original intact of secular High Baroque architecture and a relic of the early modern period, under the rule of the Order of St. John. Alt URL It has an elaborate fa√ßade designed to be imposing, of similar proportions to an auberge, and it is a prominent building in the area. It is two stories high, being built on three sides of proportionate courtyard in the centre. Another small courtyard is found at the backside, which is intended to give more natural light to the rear. Although the building has an asymmetrical plan, the main fa√ßade in Merchants street is symmetrical. The design prominently includes sumptuous edges, spread over the exterior. The main fa√ßade includes a distinctive portal, with a jotting out symmetric triple concave, and clustered pilasters, of which features are typical of Sicilian Baroque. Above the portico is a cornice and an iron-railed balcony which opens into the former criminal hall. Similar to other courts in Malta, the balcony was purposely used to read to the present public the major verdicts and newly introduced bandi. Heraldic crescents from Pinto's coat of arms decorate the main portal, and a cartouche with the following inscription is found beneath the balcony. It reads: Side fa√ßade facing St. John's Street, with the pillory on the right. Nelson's Hook is also visible behind the railing. The balcony is topped by a niche consisting of allegorical figures of Justice and Truth, as well as triumphal sculptures of a winged female figure and a putto. The latter sculptures represent fame. These sculptures are of high artistic value due to their symbolic details and fine work. Some parts of the sculptures, such as the scales held by Lady Justice, are now missing. The figures were designed to appear as being in style of movement and with dynamics. The empty spaces between these figures contained Pinto's bust and coat of arms, but they were removed during the French occupation of Malta or in the early 19th century. It is not known how the bust of Pinto looked like, however it may have been either sculpted similar to the bust on the fa√ßade of Auberge de Castille or an original work. In either case it was probably made of bronze, and stood on a marble plinth which is still there. Similar to other busts of the time, it may have been the work of Jacques Saly. The triumphal figures are similar to those found on the 17th century funerary monument of Nicolas Cotoner sculpted by Domenico Guidi, but it is unknown who worked on the replica of the Castellania. A prominent continuous cornice runs along the building at roof level which is only interrupted by the central decorations. The ground floor in Merchants Street was designed so as to house eight shops, four on each side of the main doorway. This lower fa√ßade is divided into eight bays, one for each shop, whereas it contrasts with the upper fa√ßade as it has no division between windows apart from the central decoration. Each shop has an interconnected room above, reached by an individual spiral staircase, which space was intended as a home for the owners. These rooms above the shops have a window each, forming eight square windows on the fa√ßade, one above each entrance of a shop. The windows are decorated with the symbolic crescents of Pinto. At one point, the space of one of the shops was converted to become accessible from the main building to be used as offices for the Ministry for Health. On the same street, the first floor has the same number of windows however are larger and with conspicuous window frames. Some of the hood moulds of the window moldings were chipped over the years until their renovation in 2018. The side fa√ßade along St. John's Street is not as ornate as the main fa√ßade, and it contains a set of wooden and open balconies. The entrance to the Castellania's prison cells is located in the side fa√ßade. A number of shops are also found in this street, with differentiated elevation. The building's corner between Merchants and St. John's streets contains a prominent niche-like corner with a cylindrical pedestal at the bottom which is about high. This originally served as a pillory, where prisoners would stand on it one at a time, and publicly humiliated. This also served as public entertainment, where anyone interested was allowed to throw foodstuff at the condemned such as throwing tomatoes and eggs. More serious offenders were whipped or tortured using the corda at this pillory. The corda was a rope tide to a wooden beam above the pillory and the other end used to tie the hands of the condemned who was lifted for torture. According to Eric Brockman, slaves were those often exposed to public whipping at the corner. However anybody was subject to the ill treatment, generally those who committed repeated offenses. Torture remained a means to obtain information, including forced confession, by the civil courts throughout most the eighteenth century despite it was opposed by the Bishop and by the Inquisitor. The Castellania made provisions to limit torture with the Code de Rohan when subjects were not to be tormented more than an hour. Word of mouth has it that an individual would have his debt paid when a third person or group would offer to pay it off if the bankrupt person undergoes the corda, serving as public entertainment. Those condemned to death often were subjected to endure torture and later hanged outside Valletta, in the whereabouts of the Bastion of St. Jacob. According to , the historian of the Order, amid the last three days of the Maltese carnival the locals used to recite a Roman tradition at the Castellany by dangling a stone above the pillory (instead of a human) and hit it which symbolised a temporal halt of punishment during those days. A bent iron bar in the form of a hook is affixed into the wall of the Castellania, close to the pillory. According to tradition, the hook might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now regarded as unlikely. The hook was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. At the end of the rule of the Order of St John, Stefano Ittar drew a sketch of the building as it was at the time. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through the hook in a dare, and the hook became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through the hook. Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through the hook. Brockman further claims that the hook was used to lift a cage at the pillory, with a person condemned to stay inside for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. The hook by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets. Interior The former criminal court, originally known as the Aula Criminale della Gran Corte della Castellania. The interior of the Castellania contains offices, court halls, a chapel and prison cells. A large allegorical statue representing Lady Justice or Astraea wearing a blindfold and holding weighing scales stands at the staircase which lead to the former courtrooms. The statue stands on a pedestal, and its sculptor is unknown. The staircase is grandiose on its own. The most decorated room in the building is the Sala Nobile (Noble Hall) on the first floor, which was originally a courthall, and which is now used as a meeting room. Here the judge and the nominated College of Advocates sat on a bench, which itself was a platform, wearing typical silk gown clothing of the period. The advocates on the bench were nominated and removed at the discretion of the Grand Master. When Malta was a British colony a similar short lived system was adopted, on 14 August 1832, known as the King's Counsel. The bench consisted of the Advocates of the King, and survived seven years. This room has coats-of-arms of the Castellani depicted on the upper side of the walls. There are 105 coats-of-arms, belonging to the Castellani from 1609 to the last in 1798, after which the position was abolished. In 1970 a copy of a painting by Mattia Preti, portraying two Saints of Health Cosmas and Damian, was transferred from St Luke's Hospital chapel to the hall at the Castellania. An inscription, found on a cartouche, above the main door of the hall reads: Statue of Lady Justice at the Castellania The chapel was dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows (also called the Madonna di Piet√† or Mater Dolorosa). After being deconsecrated in the late 19th century, the room was used for other purposes, and only the limestone frame, where used to be the titular painting which was retrieved during restoration works in 1991, still remains from the chapel's original interior. An ornate fountain is located at the building's main courtyard, above which is a niche with a statue and above it an elaborate sculpture of the coat-of-arms of Pinto. Similar to the fountain of the first Castellania on site, it was supplied by water from the aqueduct. A number of prison cells are found in the Castellania. The cells close to the court rooms hosted new cases and also those awaiting execution. Several other cells are located at the rear of the building, and they are surrounded by a courtyard. These cells generally housed inmates who had to serve a short sentence of less than eight days, usually due to unpaid rent or accumulated debts. Other convicts were those who refused to bake bread in Valletta which were jailed for a roughly a week and those found guilty of stealing to eat despite their social situation which were imprisoned up to three months. Women in Malta were commonly arrested for the latter and other offenses; in a 1776 criminal court case against Margerita Crocco who supposedly stole a hen and which she claimed to have found it outside her home was not found credible in her versions of events due to her suffering hunger and was sentenced to three months in the prison of the same courthouse. In some cases, individuals were imprisoned for not observing religious norms, such as eating meat on prohibited days. Prisoners with longer sentences were usually sent to other prisons, usually the Gran Prigione, and if in physical capability were subject to be sent to the galleys. Medical physicians were requested to visit the inmates in the prison when needed for multiple reasons related to their health and examinations. There were attempts to re-criminalize gambling during the late magistracy of Pinto as such activity led to undesirable financial consequences to participants but the widespread practice was instead strictly regulated, on fears that if banned it may be of benefit to the underground community. The minor inmates at the Castellania were the ones who took care of the general maintenance, cleaning and repair works of the building, while guards were responsible for the allocation of tasks and observing their performance. Some historical graffiti made by prisoners can be found at the courtyard of the prison. Significant graffiti are also found in one of the most secure cells upstairs. At the underground are the dungeons, which are described as an unpleasant place to stay. By the early 19th century, arrested females awaiting a court decision started to be sent to the women prison at Corradino (now a police station) rather than accommodated at the Castellania. The building has a direct passage to a WWII air-raid shelter from a small room at the small courtyard, which was excavated in the early 20th century. Architecture and cultural heritage The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, as La Castellania. It has been a Grade 1 scheduled property since 1992, and it is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. The court documents, of the Magna Curia Castellania (MCC), are now stored and conserved at the Banca Giuratale in Mdina. The documents form part of the National Archives of Malta and are used by historians as primary sources to research about Malta during the knights of St. John. The archives of the Acta Originalia of the Magna Curia Castellania (AOM) include 1,411 volumes, dating from the early years of the rule of the knights. Legacy The building was colloquially referred to in Maltese as il-Kistlanija (also il-Klistanija, read as yl Klystlani'a). It inspired the saying gƒßandu wiƒãƒã l-gƒßatba tal- Kistlanija, which is translated as \\"he has the face of the Castellania's doorstep\\". This referred to a shameless person showing few or no expressions. The expression Castellania's doorstep was also used to imply equality in the application of law. Commemorative coins La Castellania was depicted on two commemorative coins minted in 2009 by the Central Bank of Malta. The coins show part of the building's fa√ßade on the reverse and the coat of arms of Malta on the obverse.

The company formed in 1967 and works in close association with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra. It presents three main stage productions each year as well as the annual free event, City of Perth's Opera in the Park. The company draws from the principal canon of operatic repertoire and increasingly is involved in the commissioning and development of new operas. It has a strong education program and is involved with many concerts and community events in metropolitan and regional Western Australia.

Early life He was born to parents Archibald McInnes and Mary Gallagher on 23 January 1874, in Ramsbottom, Lancashire. Career James Campbell McInnes, a baritone, studied at the Royal College of Music (R.C.M.) under a succession of great teachers including George Henschel, Sir Charles Santley, William Shakespeare, Jacques Bouhy, and Jean de Reszke. He was a composer of songs and, in the early days of the folk-song movement, he collected songs in Scotland. He worked with Lucy Broadwood and Cecil Sharp and sang at the dedication ceremony at the opening of Cecil Sharp House. He gave after-dinner recitals for affluent Edwardian families at their homes as a result of his close friendship with Lucy Broadwood and regularly appeared in concerts across England, including Leeds and Worcester and the Broadwood Concerts. He was closely associated with the English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams and premiered many of his vocal works including the songs \\"Blackmwore by the Stour\\" and \\"Whither must I wander?\\" in 1902. The latter was the first song of the cycle Songs of Travel to be written. McInnes also sang the baritone solos in the world premieres of Willow-Wood (1903), A Sea Symphony (1910), and Five Mystical Songs (1911). The early song \\"Boy Johnny,\\" based on a Christina Rossetti poem, was first published in The Vocalist 1/6 September 1902 with the dedication \\"To J. Campbell McInnes, Esq.\\" Of his singing the composer has written, \\"The two outstanding characteristics of Campbell McInnes's singing (in addition to his beautiful baritone voice) were his feeling for words and his almost unique sense of the shape of a tune. My most vivid recollections of his singing are connected with that lovely melody (often attributed not surprisingly to J. S. Bach) \\" Jesu meines Glaubens Zier \\" and the words of Christ in the Gospel according to St. Matthew. It is for these two qualities that the guardians of English folk-song should keep his name in grateful remembrance.\\" He also worked with the composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and sang his \\"Death of Minnehaha\\" from Hiawatha at Mary Wakefield's former festival in the Lake District in 1901. McInnes sang the 1911 premiere of nine of George Butterworth's settings of poems by A. E. Housman, with the composer at the piano. With the addition of two more songs, these became the song cycles Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad and Bredon Hill and Other Songs. In 1919, he moved to Toronto in Canada, where he taught elocution and singing. His work aided in the development of music in Toronto; an example of which were his \\"Tuesday Nine O'Clocks\\", a series of recitals with unfamiliar renditions of little known vocal and chamber music. He also taught at the University of Toronto until his death in 1945. Sexuality McInnes is rumoured to have had close male friendships prior to marrying Angela Mackail (later to become the author Angela Thirkell). He was known for his heavy drinking at the time of his marriage, and much later on his bisexuality became known. Personal life McInnes and Angela Mackail had two sons, Graham McInnes (1912‚Äì1970) and Colin MacInnes (1914‚Äì1976), both of whom became well- known authors. They also had a third child, Mary, who lived less than 18 months. During their marriage, he was unfaithful by a dalliance with one of the servants. This infidelity led to their divorce in 1917. Angela left with her two sons and married George Thirkell, a Captain in the ANZAC forces. They had one child named Lancelot George (\\"Lance\\"). In 1919, they settled in Melbourne, Australia. However, in 1930, Angela left George Thirkell and returned to England with Lance, where she wrote many books and became a well- known author until her death in 1960. Neither Colin nor Graham McInnes had any contact with their father when they were growing up. However, in 1934, Graham began a search for him and travelled along with Colin to meet him in Canada. Graham described this in a book, published in 1967 called \\"Finding A Father\\", where he writes of the search for his father. James Campbell McInnes was apparently delighted to hear from his sons, although it came as a huge surprise. Graham moved to Canada soon after their meeting. Death McInnes died some years after their meeting in 1945. He is buried in Bala, Ontario, the hometown of his Canadian partner from the Jackson family.  In Literature  McInnes is referenced in Ken Follet's novel \\"Fall of Giants\\" (Part One, Ch. 9 iv). He is shown singing selections from Handel to a London audience in July 1914, on the verge of the outbreak of the First World War.Some in his audience, worried about the prospect of an imminent war with Germany, reflect that Handel was a German conposer who spent most of his life in London.

The company was founded in 1952 by Madame Kira Bousloff (formerly of the Ballets Russes) and the oldest ballet company in Australia. Artistic directors have included Garth Welch (1979‚Äì83) and Ivan Cavallari (2007‚Äì12). The current Artistic Director is Belgian Aurelien Scannella. Choreographers who have produced dances for the Ballet include: Krzysztof Pastor, David Nixon, Greg Horsman, Graeme Murphy, Stephen Baynes, Adrian Burnett, Gideon Obarzanek, Stephen Page and Natalie Weir, Jacqui Carroll, Chrissie Parrott and Garth Welch. The company performs with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra. At present the company consists of 34 full-time dancers and six 'Young Artists' (a full-time year-long development programme), structured since 2014 with Principal Dancers, Soloists, Demi-Soloists and Corps de Ballet. WAB performs three to four major seasons in Perth a year, one at The Quarry Amphitheatre in City Beach, the others usually at His Majesty's Theatre, Perth and Heath Ledger Theatre (although Burswood Theatre and Regal Theatre have also played hosts). They also tour throughout regional Western Australia, nationally and internationally, and provide choreographic workshops, an education program and other community activities.  Early days  Madame Kira Bousloff, a ballerina with the Ballet Russes, had travelled with the company to the east coast of Australia in 1938. She settled in Melbourne after her commitment to the Ballet Russes was complete, later moving to Perth with her second husband, composer James Penberthy. She fell in love with the city, declaring that the beautiful coastline reminded her of the French Riveria and later stated \\"When I came to the airport in little Perth at the end of the world, I put my feet on the ground, I looked around and I said loudly and strongly, 'This is where I'm going to live, and this is where I'm going to die ... this is my place'\\". She put together a Corps de Ballet and choreographed sequences for Perth Metropolitan Operatic Society's production of The Gypsy Baron (conducted by Penberthy), and the following year held an open meeting of dancers and teachers to discuss establishing a major ballet company. Response was good, but there were no finances to support the venture until Eric Edgley, who ran His Majesty's Theatre as a private commercial enterprise, put up 400 pounds for the first production. During the first 15 years of the company, Bousloff presided as Artistic Director, battling against financial constraints. Access to funds with inconsistent, and dancers sometimes performed without being paid. It was not until 1968‚Äì1970 when professional dancers, administrative staff and permanent headquarters were put into place. To begin with, rehearsals were held at Perth Boys' School (now Perth Institute of Contemporary Art) before moving to Perth Rowing Club, and then the first floor of the Grand Theatre (corner of Murray and Barracks Street) in 1955. In 1968, they transferred in King Street. In the early days of West Australian Ballet Bousloff was assisted by her Russian friend Madame Nadine Wulffius who also was briefly President of the Ballet company before Mr. Edwards. In 1986, Madame Nadine stated: > ...My first encounter with the WA Ballet Company was very early in 1953 the > year I arrived in Perth. Perth was at this time a very distant and sleepy > town with out the cultural life that we were used to in Europe. There was no > permanent Theatre.

In 1970, moving to North Fremantle Town Hall, where they remained until 1980, nine dancers received full-time contracts. In the same year company also went on its first international tour to New Guinea. Luis Moreno succeeded Reid as artistic director in 1973, followed by Robin Haigin 1977, Garth Welch in 1979 and Barry Moreland in 1983. Moreland went on to remain in the position for 15 years. Although the company continued to develop both its repertoire and technical and performance standards for the dancers, as well as enjoying many successes, the financial strains on the company also continued to grow. At times during the 1980s, there were doubts as to whether the company could continue. Despite this, in 1986 and agreement between the State Government and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation secured the orchestral services of the West Australian Symphony Orchestra for performances, a relationship that continues today. In 1980 the company moved to the newly refurbished His Majesty's Theatre which remained its performance, rehearsal and administrative home until 2012 when rehearsals and administration were moved to the West Australian Ballet Centre. In 1981, Garth Welch's world premiere of Peter Pan gave West Australian Ballet its very first sell-out season.  1990s  In 1990 the company established a national and international touring program. Early tours included China, Japan and the Philippines, and since then has continued to tour in South-East Asia and within Australia. Moreland's time as artistic director heralded the beginning of a series of high-profile collaborations including visual artist Charles Blackman and choreographer Chrissie Parrott. Ted Brandsen took the helm as artistic director in 1998, and won the Australian Dance Award for choreography in 2000 for his Carmen which was later recorded and sold by ABC television. Artistic Director Judy Maelor- Thomas was appointed in 2001, followed by Simon Dow in 2003. In 2007 Ivan Cavallari was appointed artistic director and efforts started to be made to greatly increase the facilities and size of the company. By 2012 West Australian Ballet had moved into the new West Australian Ballet Centre and increased the company from 19 full-time dancers to 32, enabling it to perform the best of classical repertoire including the highly acclaimed Onegin (2013). Other major productions included Marcia Haydee's The Sleeping Beauty (marking WAB's debut at The Burswood Theatre and having a cast of over 80), Gala (with guest principal artists from The Royal Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet and The Australian Ballet) and John Cranko's The Taming of the Shrew. In 2013, Cavallari left to return to Europe and Aurelien Scannella was appointed the new artistic director, his first year of programming beginning in 2014. Scannella commenced a highly successful reign as Artistic Director expanding the company's repertoire with acclaimed versions of Radio and Juliet (a play on Romeo and Juliet, set to Radiohead), Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, The Great Gatsby and acclaimed short works including Ballet 101, La Pluie, Takuto, Les Indomptes, Milnjiya, Milky Way - River of Stars, In Light and Shadow and Air and Other Invisible Forces. In 2016 WAB premiered a brand new traditional production of The Nutrcracker choreographed by Principal Dancer Jayne Smeulders CitWA, Sandy Delasalle, and Aurelien Scannella with design by Charles Cusick Smith and Phil R Daniels. In 2018 WAB had a record-breaking year at the Box Office with sell-out performances of Krzysztof Pastor's Dracula, created on the Company and a co-production with Queensland Ballet, and further sell-outs with Smeulders, Delasalle and Scannella's The Nutcracker. In 2019 the company again broke the annual Box Office record and season record with Septime Webre's ALICE (in wonderland).  West Australian Ballet Centre  In April 2012, during WAB's 60 year celebrations, the company moved all operations and rehearsals to the West Australian Ballet Centre in Maylands, Western Australia. The Forrest Building, a heritage listed building, is owned by the City of Bayswater and leased long-term to the company. The history of the building dates back to 1897 when the Victoria Institute and Industrial School for the Blind was developed as part of the celebrations for the 60th year of Queen Victoria's reign. The institute originally consisted of a complex of buildings which included a factory, workshops and residential facilities. The Federation Warehouse style of architecture, characterised by its hipped galvanized iron roof and protruding brick piers and plinths, can still be seen on the Sixth Avenue side of the building. The institute was officially opened in 1900 and was the only purpose designed and built centre of its kind in Western Australia. The institute derived income from chair caning, mat and brush making but was heavily reliant on public donations and government grants. After the First World War, production increased and the centre proved to be a significant place of assistance for service men that had lost their sight during the war. In 1923, production expanded to include basket making and sea grass furniture. The building was renamed the West Australian Institute and Industrial School for the Blind, but by 1936 was faced with severe overcrowding and workers started refusing to work in the harsh conditions. To rectify the situation, in 1937 the Lotteries Commission and West Australian Government contributed to the expansion of the building ‚Äì adding to and encompassing the existing infrastructure to create the L-shape which remains today. The style of Inter-War Stripped Classical (with Art Deco influences) is seen on the front, Whatley Crescent, face of the centre. During World War Two, the institute was again affected, with workers supporting the war effort by working 10 days for 9 days' pay and producing nets and baskets for the military. In 1948, Helen Keller visited and was appalled by the industrial conditions in which the blind children were being educated, leading to significant changes. By the 1960s a new residential building was started and the ground level was converted into a showroom for the goods. In 1967, the centre was granted a Royal Charter and became the Royal WA Institute for the Blind. \\"Cane City\\" the mat shop and retail store was closed in 1989 when it could no longer compete with cheap imports. In 2001, the institute amalgamated with the WA Deafblind Association to form the Senses Foundation and in 2004 it was decided to close the institute and sell the premises. The building remained unoccupied, except for squatters, for several years before West Australian Ballet decided it would make the ideal location. Under careful guidance of architect Catherine Watts from Sandover Pinder, and led by construction manager Probuild, the new centre was carved out of the building ‚Äì maintaining as much of the heritage elements and art deco flourishes as possible. The existence of the ballet centre is owed to the generous support of the building industry, State and local government, and corporate and private donors. The building now includes three dance studios on level 1 , The Wesfarmers Salle, The Michael John Maynard Wright Salle and Friends of WAB Salle, as well as one studio on the ground floor. Also upstairs is the Green Room, Shoe Storeroom, Male and Female change rooms and Physio/Pilates room. The Wesfarmers Salle (or Studio 1) is the largest of the three and has the facilities to host intimate performances seating approximately 140 persons. The ground levels consists of the administration offices, production offices, wardrobe department and foyer/entertaining areas. The facilities are available for hire and since opening has played hosts to weddings, fashion shows, corporate events, musical show rehearsals, dance exams, television and theatre auditions, and board meetings.

The members agreed to work on several projects per year, inviting a different music director for each one. When the group began to realize that its potential as a steady ensemble was growing quickly, and each member had specialized in Baroque strings, they decided, by the end of 2003, to present Les Muffatti to the public and give it a more official character. The group attracted new members and began to look for a regular music director, settling on Peter Van Heyghen, an internationally recognized specialist in performance practices of Renaissance and Baroque music. In June 2004, the ensemble performed its debut concert in Brussels under his direction. Les Muffatti was promptly noticed by several concert organizers, and immediately invited to present concerts at the Concertgebouw, Bruges, the Handel Akademie in Karlsruhe, the Aqua Musica festival in Amsterdam, the festival Musica Antiqua Bruges, the Holland Oude Muziek festival in Utrecht, the Musica Sacra festival in Maastricht, and the Bozar concert series in Brussels. The name Les Muffatti reflects not only what the ensemble considers to be its basic repertoire, but also its approach to performance practice. Georg Muffat (1653-1704), a cosmopolitan composer, is a key historical figure in the creation of the string orchestra, and one of the first authors to have clearly mapped out the main differences between French and Italian musical styles around 1700. Les Muffatti's favorite repertoire consists of the various sinfonias, sonatas, concertos, and overtures for string orchestra composed between c. 1680 and 1740 by such composers as Georg Muffat, Arcangelo Corelli, Georg Philipp Telemann, Georg Friedrich Handel, and many others. Future plans include focusing on Italian oratorios, serenatas, and intermezzi by Alessandro Scarlatti, Giovanni Bononcini, Antonio Caldara, Johann Adolph Hasse, and others; these are all compositions for string orchestra with an extended continuo section, a few vocal soloists, and the occasional wind instrument. For these two types of repertoire, the ensemble attempts to present to the listener as many scores as possible, the original materials of which are preserved in Belgian music libraries. From 2007 to 2009 Peter Van Heyghen will be artist in residence of the Augustinus Muziekcentrum (AMUZ) in Antwerp.

The International Screenwriter's Festival has shut down, and in 2010 was succeeded by the London Screenwriters' Festival.  History of the Festival  The International Screenwriters' Festival was created by ex-BBC producer David Pearson as a way to bring together current and prospective scriptwriters. The first festival was held from 27 to 30 June 2006 at the Cheltenham Film Studios and the Manor by the Lake. Over 500 delegates, producers, directors, developers and financiers attended four days of networking, debates, and panel discussions. Guest speakers included Ashley Pharoah (writer/co-creator, Life on Mars and Bonekickers), Guillermo del Toro (writer/director/producer, The Devil's Backbone, Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth, Hellboy II: The Golden Army), David M. Thompson (head of development, BBC Films), and Steven Moffat (writer, Jekyll, Doctor Who, Coupling). The second festival, running from 3 to 6 July 2007, drew more than 600 attendees. Speakers included Michael Goldenberg (writer, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Contact, Peter Pan), Alison Owen (producer, Brick Lane, Shaun of the Dead), and Sarah Smith (head of feature development, Aardman Animations).

For a Boolean function f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) : \\\\mathbb{B}^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{B} we call : \\\\begin{align} f_(x) & = f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{i-1},1,x_{i+1},\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_{\\\\overline{x}_i}(x)& = f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{i-1},0,x_{i+1},\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\end{align} the positive and negative cofactors of f with respect to x_i, and : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_i} & = f_{x_i}(x) \\\\oplus f_{\\\\overline{x}_i}(x) \\\\end{align} the boolean derivation of f with respect to x_i, where {\\\\oplus} denotes the XOR operator. Then we have for the Reed‚ÄìMuller or positive Davio expansion: : f = f_{\\\\overline{x}_i} \\\\oplus x_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_i}. Description This equation is written in a way that it resembles a Taylor expansion of f about x_i=0. There is a similar decomposition corresponding to an expansion about x_i=1 (negative Davio expansion): : f = f_{x_i} \\\\oplus \\\\overline{x}_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_i}. Repeated application of the Reed‚ÄìMuller expansion results in an XOR polynomial in x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n: : f = a_1 \\\\oplus a_2 x_1 \\\\oplus a_3 x_2 \\\\oplus a_4 x_1 x_2 \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus a_{2^n} x_1\\\\cdots x_n This representation is unique and sometimes also called Reed‚ÄìMuller expansion. E.g. for n=2 the result would be : f(x_1, x_2) = f_{\\\\overline{x}_1 \\\\overline{x}_2} \\\\oplus \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_{\\\\overline{x}_2}}{\\\\partial x_1} x_1 \\\\oplus \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_{\\\\overline{x}_1}}{\\\\partial x_2} x_2 \\\\oplus \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2} x_1 x_2 where : {\\\\partial^2 f \\\\over \\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2} = f_{\\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus f_{\\\\bar x_1 x_2} \\\\oplus f_{x_1 \\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus f_{x_1 x_2} . For n = 3 the result would be : f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = f_{\\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2 \\\\bar x_3} \\\\oplus {\\\\partial f_{\\\\bar x_2 \\\\bar x_3} \\\\over \\\\partial x_1} x_1 \\\\oplus {\\\\partial f_{\\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_3} \\\\over \\\\partial x_2} x_2 \\\\oplus {\\\\partial f_{\\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2} \\\\over \\\\partial x_3} x_3 \\\\oplus {\\\\partial^2 f_{\\\\bar x_3} \\\\over \\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2} x_1 x_2 \\\\oplus {\\\\partial^2 f_{\\\\bar x_2} \\\\over \\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_3} x_1 x_3 \\\\oplus {\\\\partial^2 f_{\\\\bar x_1} \\\\over \\\\partial x_2 \\\\partial x_3} x_2 x_3 \\\\oplus {\\\\partial^3 f \\\\over \\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2 \\\\partial x_3} x_1 x_2 x_3 where : {\\\\partial^3 f \\\\over \\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2 \\\\partial x_3} = f_{\\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2 \\\\bar x_3} \\\\oplus f_{\\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2 x_3} \\\\oplus f_{\\\\bar x_1 x_2 \\\\bar x_3} \\\\oplus f_{\\\\bar x_1 x_2 x_3} \\\\oplus f_{x_1 \\\\bar x_2 \\\\bar x_3} \\\\oplus f_{x_1 \\\\bar x_2 x_3} \\\\oplus f_{x_1 x_2 \\\\bar x_3} \\\\oplus f_{x_1 x_2 x_3} . Geometric interpretation This n = 3 case can be given a cubical geometric interpretation (or a graph-theoretic interpretation) as follows: when moving along the edge from \\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2 \\\\bar x_3 to x_1 \\\\bar x_2 \\\\bar x_3, XOR up the functions of the two end-vertices of the edge in order to obtain the coefficient of x_1. To move from \\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2 \\\\bar x_3 to x_1 x_2 \\\\bar x_3 there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge path passing through x_1 \\\\bar x_2 \\\\bar x_3 and the other one a two-edge path passing through \\\\bar x_1 x_2 \\\\bar x_3. These two paths encompass four vertices of a square, and XORing up the functions of these four vertices yields the coefficient of x_1 x_2. Finally, to move from \\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2 \\\\bar x_3 to x_1 x_2 x_3 there are six shortest paths which are three-edge paths, and these six paths encompass all the vertices of the cube, therefore the coefficient of x_1 x_2 x_3 can be obtained by XORing up the functions of all eight of the vertices. (The other, unmentioned coefficients can be obtained by symmetry.) Paths The shortest paths all involve monotonic changes to the values of the variables, whereas non-shortest paths all involve non-monotonic changes of such variables; or, to put it another way, the shortest paths all have lengths equal to the Hamming distance between the starting and destination vertices. This means that it should be easy to generalize an algorithm for obtaining coefficients from a truth table by XORing up values of the function from appropriate rows of a truth table, even for hyperdimensional cases (n = 4 and above). Between the starting and destination rows of a truth table, some variables have their values remaining fixed: find all the rows of the truth table such that those variables likewise remain fixed at those given values, then XOR up their functions and the result should be the coefficient for the monomial corresponding to the destination row. (In such monomial, include any variable whose value is 1 (at that row) and exclude any variable whose value is 0 (at that row), instead of including the negation of the variable whose value is 0, as in the minterm style.) Similar to binary decision diagrams (BDDs), where nodes represent Shannon expansion with respect to the according variable, we can define a decision diagram based on the Reed‚ÄìMuller expansion. These decision diagrams are called functional BDDs (FBDDs).  Derivations  The Reed‚ÄìMuller expansion can be derived from the XOR-form of the Shannon decomposition, using the identity \\\\overline{x} = 1 \\\\oplus x: : \\\\begin{align} f & = x_i f_{x_i} \\\\oplus \\\\overline{x}_i f_{\\\\overline{x}_i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = x_i f_{x_i} \\\\oplus (1 \\\\oplus x_i) f_{\\\\overline{x}_i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = x_i f_{x_i} \\\\oplus f_{\\\\overline{x}_i} \\\\oplus x_i f_{\\\\overline{x}_i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = f_{\\\\overline{x}_i} \\\\oplus x_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_i}. \\\\end{align} Derivation of the expansion for n = 2: :\\\\begin{align} f & = f_{\\\\bar x_1} \\\\oplus x_1 {\\\\partial f \\\\over \\\\partial x_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\Big( f_{\\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus x_2 {\\\\partial f \\\\over \\\\partial x_2} \\\\Big)_{\\\\bar x_1} \\\\oplus x_1 {\\\\partial \\\\Big(f_{\\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus x_2 {\\\\partial f \\\\over \\\\partial x_2} \\\\Big) \\\\over \\\\partial x_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = f_{\\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus x_2 {\\\\partial f_{\\\\bar x_1} \\\\over \\\\partial x_2} \\\\oplus x_1 \\\\Big({\\\\partial f_{\\\\bar x_2} \\\\over \\\\partial x_1} \\\\oplus x_2 {\\\\partial^2 f \\\\over \\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2}\\\\Big) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = f_{\\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus x_2 {\\\\partial f_{\\\\bar x_1} \\\\over \\\\partial x_2} \\\\oplus x_1 {\\\\partial f_{\\\\bar x_2} \\\\over \\\\partial x_1} \\\\oplus x_1 x_2 {\\\\partial^2 f \\\\over \\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2}. \\\\end{align} Derivation of the second-order boolean derivative: : \\\\begin{align} {\\\\partial^2 f \\\\over \\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2} & = {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial x_1} \\\\Big( {\\\\partial f \\\\over \\\\partial x_2} \\\\Big) = {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial x_1} (f_{\\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus f_{x_2}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = (f_{\\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus f_{x_2})_{\\\\bar x_1} \\\\oplus (f_{\\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus f_{x_2})_{x_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = f_{\\\\bar x_1 \\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus f_{\\\\bar x_1 x_2} \\\\oplus f_{x_1 \\\\bar x_2} \\\\oplus f_{x_1 x_2}. \\\\end{align} See also * Algebraic normal form (ANF) * Ring sum normal form (RSNF) * Zhegalkin normal form * Karnaugh map * Irving Stoy Reed * David Eugene Muller * Reed‚ÄìMuller code ReferencesFurther reading Boolean algebra ","title":"Reed‚ÄìMuller expansion"},{"id":"9608299","text":"Breamlea, Victoria, Australia, is a secluded seaside hamlet located on the south coast of the Bellarine Peninsula, 18 kilometres south of Geelong and halfway between Barwon Heads and Torquay. It is divided between the City of Greater Geelong and the Surf Coast Shire. In the 2016 census, Breamlea had a permanent population of 162. Geography Breamlea is nestled in the sand dunes between Thomsons Creek and the beach. The nearest township to Breamlea is Connewarre. Thomsons Creek, also known as Bream Creek, runs through a natural network of reedy canals and widens before it enters Buckleys Bay. At the mouth of the creek is Point Impossible which is a well-known longboard surfing break. The patrolled surf beach at Breamlea is called Bancoora, and is the closest surf beach to Melbourne. The beach was named after the steamship SS Bancoora that ran aground on there in 1881. Other non-patrolled beaches along this stretch of coast are not heavily used and are often empty. History The area was once populated by the Mon Mart Clan of Wathaurong people. The rock shelves on the coast in the area have always been rich in shellfish, and large middens of the discarded shells can be seen on the headland between Buckley's Bay and Stingray Bay. William Buckley lived in this area and across the road from the caravan park is a well that he is supposed to have used. The clipper ship Victoria Tower, on its maiden voyage to Melbourne, was wrecked on rocks at Point Impossible in 1869. It had been encountering problems with its compasses during its 85-day voyage to Australia. The wreck is one of many included in Victoria's Underwater Shipwreck Discovery Trail. On 14 July 1891 the steamship SS Bancoora ran aground on what is now the surf beach. The cargo included a young elephant, a rhinoceros, monkeys and parrots. All were landed safely and taken by lorry to Geelong, although the rhinoceros unfortunately only survived for two days. The wreck was sold for breaking up in 1906. Thompsons Creek attracted campers and fishermen from the 1870s onwards and by the 1920s, makeshift huts were being built by regular campers. During the Great Deprrssion, squatters constructed more permanent buildings, rate-free, and eked out meals from the creek and the ocean. The existence of the settlement was formally acknowledged by the government in October 1941 when it was proclaimed in the Government Gazette, creating a small linear township huddled behind the high, Moonah-covered sand dunes. The proclamation paved the way for the sale of the first freehold land in 1942. A Post Office opened on 1 July 1947. Breamlea was only connected to the electricity grid in the 1960s. Breamlea State School opened in the local hall on 27 May 1952 and moved to a standalone site on 31 January 1955. It closed on 14 January 1966. In 1962 a surf life saving club was formed at Bancoora Beach, with clubrooms being built in 1963. On 8 April 1987 the original clubhouse was guttered by fire. For the next four seasons the club operated from a tin shed, until the present building was opened on 25 October 1992. Township Breamlea has around 100 houses nestled in the sand dunes between Thomsons Creek and the beach. The main street, Horwood Drive, is located at the base of the dunes, with Blyth Street above. Houses are located on the south side of Horwood Drive, and the north side of Blyth Street. There is also a caravan park and small general store with basic supplies. Halfway along Horwood Drive is a recreation reserve with an oval, children's playground, barbecue facilities and toilet. The area is underdeveloped and many residents wish to keep it that way. The architecture of Breamlea is a mix of fibro-cement beach shacks built in the 1950s and 1960s, and modern architect-designed houses. Sewage outfall Barwon Water's Black Rock sewage treatment plant is located to the north east of Breamlea, handing effluent from Geelong and surrounding suburbs. Black Rock was first chosen as the ocean outfall for Geelong's sewage in 1912, with the outfall sewer being built during the next three years. Initially the sewage was left untreated before being discharged into the ocean, polluting several beaches downstream on the prevailing ocean currents. A basic comminutor was installed at the outlet in the 1970s, and in the 1980s the current treatment plant was built with an upgraded filtration system, along with a 1.2 kilometre long ocean outfall. 1997 saw an upgrade to the plant, with secondary filtration introduced, and a pipeline installed to allow recycled water to be used on a flower farm at Torquay. Bancoora Surf Life Saving Club The Bancoora SLSC conduct seasonal surf patrols over the summer period, throughout January the beach has lifeguards on duty every day. Each summer a nipper program is run to educate and enhance the surf skills of young members. Bancoora SLSC hosted the Australian Surf Lifesaving Championships during the Easter of 1977. Due to large surf that was present during the championships, many events were relocated to Fisherman's Beach in Torquay. The club celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 2013. Wind generator Wind generator at Breamlea in 2007 A wind generator, located on Black Rock Road, was erected in November 1987, as a demonstration unit, by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria and the Victorian Solar Energy Council (now Energy Victoria). The turbine, atop a 22-metre monopole, was of 60 kW capacity, and was manufactured by Westwind of Western Australia. As a consequence of the privatisation of electricity supply in Victoria, the generator was sold in 1994 to the Alternative Technology Association of Melbourne. December 1995 saw it sold again, to Michael Gunter, a member of the previous organisation. Electricity production ceased at 1200hrs on 17 May 2003 due to an electrical generator burn-out, caused by moisture, salt, and electrical flash-over. Local water utility Barwon Water bought the turbine the same year, restoring it to service in early 2004. It generates approximately 80,000 kWh per year for the grid, with an estimated 90-95 per cent availability, and produces between 7 kW and 10.3 kW of average power.

It is bordered by Deir Nidham to the east, Bani Zeid to the north, Rantis and al Lubban el Gharbi to the west, and Deir Abu Mash'al to the south. ‚ÄòAbud Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 5 History Sherds from the Iron Age II, Byzantine, Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk eras have been found.Finkelstein et al, 1997, pp. 202‚Äì203 There is archeological evidence that the village was inhabited during the Roman, Byzantine, Crusader, Ayyubid, Mamluk and Ottoman eras. Medieval era During Fatimid, in 1030, a Christian monk from Aboud named Elias copied Syriac manuscripts in Antioch. He later returned to Aboud and founded the Deir al-Kaukab monastery near the village.Ellenblum, 2003, pp. 131‚Äì132. A Palestinian Syriac inscription in the St. Mary Church in Aboud indicate that the church existed in the village by at least 1058, also during Fatimid rule. In 1099, Aboud and much of Syria was conquered by European Crusaders. During the Crusader period, Aboud was known by them as the Latin Casale Santa Maria. At the time, it was an unfortified agricultural village inhabited mostly by local Orthodox Christians. A minority of the population consisted of Crusader settlers.Ellenblum, 2003, pp. 130‚Äì131. The Crusaders made improvements and additions to the church, such as the nave and the north aisle.Ellenblum, 2003, p. 133. In 1104, Mufarij ibn Abu al-Hayr al-Abudi, a monk from Aboud, copied Syriac manuscripts in the Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai. In 1167, Casale Santa Maria was sold by King Baldwin IV to the Knights Hospitallers. Starting in 1176, they used revenues from the village to supply white bread to the sick in the hospital of Jerusalem. In 1225, Yaqut al-Hamawi noted Aboud was a \\"small town in Filastin Province, near Jerusalem. The name is Hebrew, and [has] become Arabicized.\\"Yaqut al-Hamawi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 382. At another point in the 13th century, an Aboud monk, Sarur ibn Abd al-Masih al-Abudi, was recorded as copying Syriac manuscripts in Cairo. The southern part of Aboud was founded in the 13th or 14th century, during Mamluk rule. Two ornate mausoleums in this part of Aboud were built during the Mamluk period.Ellenblum, 2003, p. 132. Arab historian al-Maqrizi mentioned these in the 14th century. Ottoman era Aboud as part of Palestine was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. In the 1553‚Äì57 tax records, Aboud had a population of 35 families; 19 of whom were Christian and 16 Muslim. In the 1596 Ottoman tax records, it was classified as part of the nahiya (\\"sub- district\\") of Ramla, part of the Sanjak of Gaza. Its population remained the same, with 19 Christian households and 16 Muslim households,Petersen, 2005, p. 131 and the inhabitants paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, and other produce; a total of 21,000 ak√ße. All of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 156 It was later designated as a part of the Bani Zeid administrative region, still under the Ottomans.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 124 In 1870 the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin found that Aboud contained 800 inhabitants, half Greek Orthodox and half Muslims,Gu√©rin, 1875, pp. 87‚Äì90 while an Ottoman village list of about the same year showed that Aboud had 225 Muslims with 69 houses, and 170 Greek Orthodox with 66 houses, though the population count included men only.Socin, 1879, p. 142 Noted to be in the Beni Zeid districtHartmann, 1883, p. 106, found 110 houses In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the village as \\"a large and flourishing Christian village, of stone, the houses nearly all marked with the Cross in red paint,\\" with a population of 400 Orthodox Christians and 100 Muslims.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 289 In 1896 the population of Abud was estimated to be about 303 Muslims and 366 Christians.Schick, 1896, p. 122 British Mandate era In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Aboud had a population of 754; 352 Muslim and 402 Christians.Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub- district of Ramallah, p. 16 The latter included 335 Orthodox, 41 Roman Catholics, and 26 who belonged to the Church of England.Barron, 1923, Table XIV, p. 45 At the time of the 1931 census, the population had increased to 910; 470 Christians and 440 Muslims, in 215 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 47 The Christians largely inhabited the older, northern part of Aboud, while the Muslims inhabited the relatively newer, southern part. In the 1945 statistics, the population was 1,080; 550 Muslims and 530 Christians.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 26 The total land area was 15,007 dunams, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

After Oslo II in 1995, 16.8% of village land was classified as Area B, and the remaining 83.2% as Area C. Israel has confiscated land from Aboud in order to construct the Israeli settlements of Beit Aryeh-Ofarim. ‚ÄòAbud Village Profile, ARIJ, pp. 16‚Äì17 In late July 2018, Israeli authorities informed village elders that they intended seizing a further 324 dunums (80 acres) of land shared by both Aboud and Al-Lubban al-Gharbi on grounds that the land was needed in order to construct an Israeli-only road between the settlements of Beit Arye and Ofarim.Yumna Patel, 'Drowning among Israeli settlements, an ancient Christian village in Palestine struggles to survive,' Mondoweiss 17 August 2018 Demographics According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the village had a population of approximately 2,084 inhabitants in 2007. It has a mixed population of Muslims and Christians, mostly Eastern Orthodox. It has ancient churches built during the Byzantine period of the 6th to 8th centuries. Ancient churches Adjacent to Aboud is an ancient monastery named after Saint Barbara. Located on a hill due west of the village, the Church of Saint Barbara was erected in the Byzantine period. Archaeologists trace its history to the 6th century CE.'Aboud, the city of flowers, threatened by the Israeli Segregation Wall Applied Research Institute ‚Äì Jerusalem. 2005-06-09. Ancient catacombs have been uncovered by the church; their dating is uncertain. One of the burial caves is especially grandiose, with a door post decorated with carvings of wreaths, grape vines and grape clusters standing at its entrance. Locals consider Saint Barbara to have been the oldest and most sacred of Aboud's churches. Palestinian Christians visited the church annually on 17 December to celebrate the St. Barbara's Day festival. On 31 May 2002, the Israeli army blew up and destroyed the church. The Israeli military claimed that they were unaware of the church's significance and demolished it by mistake. Al-Abudiyah Church, also known as Saint Mary's Church, is situated in the center of Aboud. It was long believed to have been founded during the Crusader period in Palestine, when it was known as Casale Santa Maria. But, an Aramaic inscription on a vault in the church, found during late 20th century restoration work, indicates that it was founded before the arrival of Crusaders, but fell into disrepair. According to the inscription, the church was rebuilt in 1058 CE during the Fatimid era. In the 18th century an additional wall, as well as several windows and doors were constructed. Restorations were conducted in 1997. The cement plaster in the vaulting of the church was replaced with traditional mortar, stones inside the church were cleaned, the atrium was repaved, and a reinforcing northern wall was constructed. In 2013 Christians from the United Kingdom worked on a project with the church choir of St. Mary's Church to record \\"The Mary Prayers\\"The Mary Prayers as a fundraising initiative. Proceeds from the sales of the CD or downloads are directed to humanitarian projects for the Muslims and Christians in Aboud. Additional local churches include one dedicated to St. Theodore (located in the center of the village) and to St. Anastasia (to the south of the village). Both are from the 7th‚Äì8th centuries.Dauphin, 1998, p. 825 Economy Historically, Aboud's economy was centered on agriculture, specifically olives. Their cultivation in the 21st century takes up 43% of village lands. In total, 57% of Aboud's lands are cultivable; other crops are figs, apples, grapes, and almonds. Its primary agricultural products are olive oil, olive-based soap, dried figs, and almonds. In 2005 agriculture employed 19% of the village's labor force. The remaining 81% work in the governmental and private sectors, construction, and animal husbandry. Following the Second Intifada, which began in 2000, the residents who worked in Israel (10% of Aboud's labor force) lost their jobs there.

It is often simply referred to as the dgƒßajsa (, pl. dgƒßajjes ), but this word refers to any type of boat in the Maltese language. The boat developed in the 17th century, and was extensively used to ferry passengers in the Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour between the 18th and 20th centuries. Their use declined in the late 20th century, and today few dgƒßajjes remain in operation ferrying tourists around the harbours. Variants of the boats are still used extensively in rowing regattas held twice a year. History During Hospitaller rule in Malta, the demand for a ferry service in the Grand Harbour increased as the settlements of Valletta and the Three Cities developed. The dgƒßajsa tal-pass is believed to have developed to meet this demand in the early 17th century. The earliest known reference to ferry boats in the harbour is from 1601, and the earliest known depiction is a drawing by Willem Schellinks from 1664. The design of the dgƒßajsa bears similarities with ferry boats from Sicily. View of the Grand Harbour in the 1890s with various dgƒßajjes in the foreground. The number of dgƒßajjes in the harbour is believed to have greatly increased in the 18th century, and Grand Masters Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena and Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc issued regulations aimed at preventing the escape of Muslim slaves from Malta on board dgƒßajjes. In the 19th century, when Malta was under British rule, dgƒßajjes were extensively used to ferry passengers in the Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour. At this point, the design of the boats was modified and they were usually highly decorated. Dgƒßajjes were used to ferry people from ships to the shore and also to ferry people between the harbour settlements. It was usually propelled by one man standing, facing forward, and pushing on two oars. In the 1950s, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) traveled on a dgƒßajsa called St. Angelo from a Royal Navy vessel to Fort St. Angelo. This particular boat had been built in 1950‚Äì52, and it has been restored and is now used to ferry tourists in the Grand Harbour. Crew of in dgƒßajjes and dinghies from their ship preparing for a race during World War II Some dgƒßajjes also saw limited use outside Malta. In the 1950s, Salvatore Formosa became the official boatman of the , and his dgƒßajsa saw use in various Mediterranean ports, including Naples, Saint-Tropez, Rimini, Barcelona and Monaco. While in Venice, he reportedly outran a gondola after challenging its gondolier to a race. Formosa's dgƒßajsa is now preserved at the Malta Maritime Museum. The use of the dgƒßajsa began to decline after steam ferries were introduced in Malta's harbours in 1882 and 1906, and later by the introduction of buses in 1918. The reduction of British forces in Malta later on in the 20th century further increased its decline. By 1970, many dgƒßajjes began to be propelled by outboard motors and oars were rarely used. The number of boats has declined greatly since the 1970s, and today no more than a few dozen original boats still survive. Very few people retain the skills of building such boats. The dgƒßajjes which are still in use today mainly carry tourists on tours around Malta's harbours. The Koperattiva tal-Barklori is a co-operative of boat owners who try to preserve the few remaining dgƒßajjes. The oldest surviving boat which is still in use is believed to be the Palomba, which was built in the mid-19th century. Description The fore stempost of a dgƒßajsa Since the dgƒßajsa tal-pass is used to ferry passengers within harbours, it is light and the timber used in its construction is not as strong as that in other boats such as the kajjik, luzzu or Gozo boat, which carried greater loads and traveled longer distances. Early dgƒßajjes had a slanting fore stempost and no washboards, but the latter feature was in use by the mid-18th century. Stemposts at both ends of the boat had been introduced by the end of the 18th century. In the 19th century, the boats usually had a slightly curved fore stempost, but this was replaced by a straight one in the early 20th century. The high stem and stern pieces seem to be mainly ornamental but they are useful in handling the boat and in the boarding and disembarking of passengers. It is believed that dgƒßajjes began to be painted in bright colours in the late 18th century, and by the mid-19th century they often bore the Eye of Horus. By the 1880s, many of the boats were decorated with elaborate floral designs which varied from boat to boat. Regatta variants The dgƒßajsa of Senglea which won the regatta of 8 September 2008 Variants of the dgƒßajsa are still commonly used in the rowing regattas held in the Grand Harbour on 31 March and 8 September each year. The boats used in the races were initially identical to the water taxis, but from the 1930s they began to be built to be lighter and faster, losing some of the traditional aspects of the dgƒßajsa tal- pass in the process. The boats are built to strict specifications. There are two variants of the dgƒßajsa tal-pass with two or four oars, and a larger variant known as the dgƒßajsa tal-midalji which also has four oars. The smaller boats are manned by two men: one standing and one sitting, while those with four oars are manned by four: two standing and two sitting. Variants of other traditional boats, the kajjik and frejgatina, also compete in the regatta. In 2012, two dgƒßajjes competed in the Great River Race on the River Thames. Legacy Emblem of Malta, 1975‚Äì1988 The dgƒßajsa appeared on the emblem of Malta which was used from 1975 to 1988. Cyril Tawney's song \\"The Ballad of Sammy's Bar\\" mentions these boats in which the last line of every verse is \\"Call away the di-so\\". Tawney appended the following note in explanation: \\"A dgƒßajsa is a Maltese gondola used by sailors for cutting across the creeks instead of going round them. In Malta they are a legal means of sailors getting back on board ship if they miss the liberty boat. In Britain it is illegal for them to use anything than the official liberty boats to get back to ship.\\"Modern Folk Ballads; selected by Charles Causley.

The logo on the coat shows the legendary teacher Dronacharya (from Mahabaharat) training his disciple Arjuna. Maha Rao (born 1 July 1958) is a wrestler and wrestling coach from Chirawa, Rajasthan in India. In 2006, he was awarded the Dronacharya Award, the highest award of the land in the field of coaching of sports and athletics, by the government of India. Early life He was the fourth son out of a family of 6 children born to Bhana Ram Rao and Mohri devi to a Yadav family in small village Ghardana Khurd in Jhunjhunu Rajasthan. After attaining his primary education in the same village he proceeded on to high school in Khetri and then graduated in Mathematics from Chirawa college, Chirawa in Jhunjhunu in 1980. His marriage was solemnised to Mrs Santosh on 15 June 1983. Though he was lured to wrestling from the very childhood, his parents asked him to continue studies. Abiding by his parents advice he went on to get his Masters in Economics during 1981 to 1984 from Rajasthan University, Jaipur. In 1985 he moved to the nearby Chirawa town and settled there. Pressed by his interest in wrestling he simultaneously kept practicing lest he should lose touch with the sport. Meanwhile he obtained a diploma in wrestling from the national institute of sports in 1982-83. Until then he was a national level wrestler in the country representing the state of Rajasthan but later jumped on to training pehlwani. Maha Singh Rao receiving the Dronacharya Award from the president of India Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. Career After finishing his studies he joined the Sports Authority of India as a Wrestling Coach. He started training disciples in both freestyle wrestling and Indian style also known as pehlwani. His initial posting was in Guru Hanuman Akhara in New Delhi which was at that time being managed by Guru Hanuman, a legendary figure in the Indian style of wrestling. Maha Singh started training the budding pehlwans under the able guidance of Guru Hanuman. He was briefly transferred to Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan but soon was sent back to Delhi where he is currently training wrestlers in the Guru Hanuman Akhara in New Delhi. After the demise of Guru Hanuman in May 1999 the whole responsibility of managing and training the young wrestlers came down on Maha singh. Recognising his potential he was sent by the Government of India to attend the international coaching course in Budapest, Hungary in 2005. The course is conducted by the Universitas Budapestinesis de semmelweis nominata and is recognised by the international Olympic council for Olympic solidarity. Later he was selected for the prestigious Dronacharya Award for the year 2005. Many of his disciples have won national and international titles including the prestigious Arjun Award.

History PICA is currently housed in a heritage building at 53 James Street, Perth. The building, which dates from 1896, was for 40 years the Perth Boys' and Girls' School (one of several schools known collectively as Perth Central School). The Perth Central School was developed principally between 1877 and 1914. It amalgamated the Infants' School, Perth Boys' School, Perth Girls' School, Manual Training School and Normal School on the one site between Roe and James Streets. On 22 May 1895, the contract to construct Perth Boys' and Girls' Schools building in James Street was awarded to William Atkins for the sum of 10,452 pounds. Soon after the contract was awarded, the plans were altered to include an extra eight classrooms, however only six of these were constructed at the time. On 18 January 1897, the new Perth Boys' and Girls' School building, which had been completed a few months earlier, was officially opened by the Minister for Education, Mr (later Sir) E. H. Wittenoom. The first headmaster was Mr W J Rooney. The Education Department Report for the year 1896, stated: \\"The new Central Boys' and Girls' Schools, which had been in the course of erection on the reserve in James Street, Perth, for some nine or ten months, were completed at the end of the year. ... The buildings provide accommodation for 500 boys on the ground floor and 500 girls on the upper floor.\\" The construction of the Boys' School was the largest project undertaken for the Education Department in the 1890s. In April 1900, further additions to the Perth Boys' and Girls' Schools building were completed. The additions included two classrooms: one for the boys and one for the girls, each designed to house seventy-five children. In September 1936, the new Perth Girls' School opened in East Perth and the entire building was used by the Boys' School. In 1947, the Perth Boys' School became the Perth Boys' High School. During the 1950s, residential development in the inner city decreased as land values increased and the growth of the suburbs displaced inner city living. In 1959, the Perth Boys' High School closed and the Perth Technical College moved into the buildings. The building was known as the James Street Annexe. In the following years, a number of minor changes were made to the building, including electrical connections and installation of gas heating. In July 1988, the successor of Perth Technical College, TAFE, vacated the building and it became the Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts (PICA). Plans to refurbish the building were drawn up by Donaldson and Warn. In 1991, the building was refurbished according to revised plans. On 8 November 1991 the building was officially opened as PICA. In 1992 Donaldson and Warn were awarded a commendation for their work on the PICA building by the WA chapter of RAIA in the category of Conservation/Recycled buildings. In 1996, PICA used the building for a variety of purposes including: a cafe, performing space, gallery space and administration space. Built form Projecting tower on the northern facade The PICA building was designed in the Federation Free Classical style. The exterior features prominent decorative elements but, overall, displays a degree of restraint appropriate to a serious academic institution. The physical evidence confirms that main boys' and girls' entries were given particular emphasis in their level of detailing, but that the building was clearly designed to be seen in the round. The external walls are constructed of face brick in stretcher bond, with a random stone plinth below ground floor level. On the northern side of the building the stone plinth is below the present street level. The decorative detailing is focused along the eaves and around the entry porches and window openings. The building has a corrugated iron, hipped roof with a raised section over the central gallery space. There are wide eaves with timber slats to all sides. The corrugated iron roof has been reclad and no chimneys or roof vents are visible, but the majority of the down pipes and rainwater heads appear to be original. The building was originally designed with two principal entries, one for the Girls' School on the northern facade and one for the Boys' School on the western side. The Boys' School entry was designed as a projecting single storey porch with a hipped corrugated iron roof, plain brick walls along the sides and a triple arched entry to the front. The Girls' School entry faced onto James Street and was housed at the base of the projecting tower. This is now used as the main entry to PICA. The current interiors have a blend of original detailing with clearly contrasting modern adaptations and fixtures dating from the early 1990s conversion of the building to a contemporary arts centre. Some of the key features of the recent works include: the introduction of direct access to the ground floor of James Street; a large new reception area off this entry; a functional timber and steel stair within the reception area; large plain openings through former classroom walls; the creation of an open, ground floor performance space at the western end; the use of exposed steel trusses to support the gallery over the performance space; and the creation of a cafe within two former ground floor classrooms at the north- eastern corner of the building. Current use A school holiday event in front of PICA PICA began operating from the James Street building in 1988 with the main aim of promoting contemporary art (visual, performing or mixed) in Western Australia. Through a year-round program of exhibitions, performances, screenings, studios, publications and a range of interdisciplinary projects, PICA seeks to promote the contemporary arts while stimulating critical discussion about the arts and broader cultural issues. PICA also offers a public and education program which seeks to strengthen the relationship between its artistic programs and diverse audiences. PICA is centrally located adjacent to the city's library, art gallery and entertainment precinct forming a \\"cultural hub\\" within the city. The institute plays a key role in Perth's creative community and seeks to provide support to artists at all stages of their career through programming, development, mentoring and advocacy opportunities. In many aspects of its operations, PICA might be understood as an incubator: providing resources, mentoring and support for both emerging and established artists whilst promoting new and emerging ideas, forms and practices to the broader community. Heritage value The former Perth Boys and Girls School building was classified by the National Trust (WA) on 3 July 1978, and entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission on 21 October 1980. It was permanently entered on to the State Register of Heritage Places on 24 March 2000.

On June 30, 1524, the castle was acquired by the Batthy√°ny family, which retains ownership through a historical foundation that provides for the care and maintenance of the castle. Burg G√ºssing is above sea level.Burg G√ºssing Elevation and Position Established by B√©la III of Hungary around 1180, Burg G√ºssing is the oldest castle in Burgenland.https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl;=en&js;=n&prev;=_t&hl;=en&ie;=UTF-8&layout;=2&eotf;=1&u;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.burgguessing.info%2Fburg- guessing.htm  History =Middle Ages Wolfer, a German knight, who arrived to the Kingdom of Hungary during the reign of G√©za II, founded a Benedictine monastery on the top of the mountain G√ºssing (or K√ºsz√©n) in 1157. Contrary to the narrations of the medieval chronicles, he did not erect a wooden castle there; the establishing charter also emphasizes the mount of K√ºsz√©n was an \\"uninhabited wasteland\\" before the erection of the abbey. After a few decades of its operation, B√©la III confiscated the abbey from the Benedictine friars and used the abbey's stone buildings to erect a royal castle (Novum Castrum or √öjv√°r, \\"New Castle\\", later N√©met√∫jv√°r, \\"German's New Castle\\", today Burg G√ºssing) on top of the hill around 1180. By that time, the tense relationship between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire were emerged, as B√©la supported the papacy against Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor during the Investiture Controversy. The Hungarian king also had conflicts over border disputes with the Duchy of Austria in the second half of the 1170s. Under such circumstances, the mountain of K√ºsz√©n and its fortified abbey proved to be a strategic military site along the border with Austria. The castle is first mentioned by contemporary records in 1198. According to historian Rich√°rd Horv√°th, the castle was called √öjv√°r, because the proximity of the castle of Pinka√≥v√°r (or simply √ìv√°r, \\"Old Castle\\", present-day part of Hannersdorf in Austria), which was the oldest motte-and-bailey castle in the region. Sometimes before 1225, Andrew II donated the castle to his faithful partisan Demetrius Cs√°k. The Benedictine friars continuously petitioned against Andrew's decision to the Holy See, who urged Demetrius several times to recover N√©met√∫jv√°r to the Benedictine friars, but he refused to do that. As a result, Pope Gregory IX excommunicated Demetrius in 1228 or 1229. When the pope sent another complaint to the new king, B√©la IV in 1238, Demetrius still possessed the castle. It is plausible that Demetrius owned N√©met√∫jv√°r until his death; the next mention of the castle is from 1263, long after his death. The Benedictine friars were compensated only in that year by B√©la IV, who donated some landholdings in Nyitra County to the Pannonhalma Archabbey, \\"in exchange\\" for the castle. By that time, his loyal baron, Maurice Pok and his brothers already possessed N√©met√∫jv√°r, when B√©la IV donated some surrounding lands to them. According to the royal charter, they were granted the castle \\"to successfully defend\\" and thereafter they built a tower and other buildings in the \\"superior castle\\" at their own expense. Rich√°rd Horv√°th argues these events occurred in the first half of the 1250s, when B√©la IV was involved in a military confrontation with Ottokar II of Bohemia over the Duchy of Styria. Despite statements of some historiographical works, Wolfer's descendants, the K≈ëszegi family did not regain the castle in 1270s (earlier Hungarian academic works in the late 19th century still erroneously called the K≈ëszegis as \\"N√©met√∫jv√°ris\\" or \\"G√ºssingers\\"). It was not mention as property of the K≈ëszegis neither 1271 nor 1279. King Ladislaus IV referred to N√©met√∫jv√°r as a royal castle in 1274, when its castellan, Michael, son of Budmerius was granted the estate of Nevegy in Somogy County, because he successfully defended the castle against the invading Bohemian troops and recovered the fort to the Hungarian king in the previous year. The siege of N√©met√∫jv√°r presumably occurred in the late spring of 1273. The castle fell to Wolfer's great-great grandson, the notorious oligarch Ivan K≈ëszegi in the first half of the 1280s, during his rapid expansion over Western Transdanubia. When Albert I, Duke of Austria launched his massive royal campaign (still incorrectly called \\"G√ºssing Feud\\" in Austrian historiography) with his 15,000-size army against the K≈ëszegis in the spring of 1289, N√©met√∫jv√°r was also besieged and captured among other important forts. The new Hungarian king, Andrew III recovered the castle after his campaign against Austria in 1291. The Peace of Hainburg, which concluded the war, was signed on 26 August 1291. Based on a lost document, written by M√≥r Wertner, Berthold von Emmerberg, who seized the castle from Ivan K≈ëszegi two years earlier, strongly opposed to hand N√©met√∫jv√°r back to the Hungarians. The peace treaty prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert had seized from the K≈ëszegis, which was in the interests of both monarchs. Thereafter, Ivan K≈ëszegi and his brothers rebelled against the king. After a brief war, Andrew was captured and imprisoned by Ivan in August 1292. He was liberated within four months, it is possible that the recovery of N√©met√∫jv√°r to the K≈ëszegis was one of the conditions to get rid of his captivity. Ivan K≈ëszegi and his descendants possessed the castle thereafter. Charles I, who defeated the oligarchs one after another, launched a military campaign against Ivan's younger son, John the \\"Wolf\\" in 1327. His royal general Alexander K√∂cski captured four castles, including N√©met√∫jv√°r, resulting the ultimate disintegration of the K≈ëszegis' power over Transdanubia. Batthy√°ny lordship On June 30, 1524, Francis I Batthy√°ny (1497‚Äì1566) received Castle G√ºssing and the associated lands. Times changed and due to the modernization of warfare, the castle and fortress of G√ºssing slowly lost its strategic importance. In 1777 all guns were removed. Due to the high cost of maintenance and the introduced ‚Äúroof tax‚Äù by empress Maria Theresia, there was a partial demolition of some of the castles fortifications. In 1870 Prince Philipp Batthy√°ny-Strattmann established a foundation for the preservation of the castle and monastery as an historic structure. However, in the years following World War I, foundation had lost most of its money due to inflation and the costs of war. Today, the castle acts as a tourist attraction in addition to being an important historical structure. Theater performances, concerts and readings can be attended on the castle grounds during the summer months, and there is a family museum located within.

The name Moore Market comes from a market that used to exist at the site before being demolished to make way for the expansion of the Chennai Central station. History The Moore Market, c. 1905 Moore Market was originally built to house the hawkers in the Broadway area of Madras. Its foundation stone was laid by Sir George Moore, president of the Madras Corporation in 1898. The building was designed in the Indo Saracenic style by RE Ellis and was constructed by A. Subramania Aiyar. The market, which consisted of a series of shops around a central quadrangle was finally completed in 1900, and had sections for meat, flowers and food items, but was particularly popular for curios including antiques, art, books and pets. Over the years, it gradually took the status of a flea market where one could buy rare and second hand items for a bargain. The Indian Railways, needing land to expand the congested M.G.R Chennai Central station, tried unsuccessfully to take over the market. On 30 May 1985, the market building was destroyed due to a fire whose cause remains a mystery. The structure was later razed to make way for the new Chennai Suburban Railway terminus and reservation centre. This multistoreyed building also houses the offices of various departments of the railways. The demolition of the market and People's Park is considered to mark the beginning of heritage activism in the city. Rehabilitation The government later built a new commercial complex named \\"Lily Pond Complex\\" to rehabilitate the traders of Moore Market, further west of the original site. Built in 1986 at a cost of 66 million, the shopping complex lies mostly vacant due to poor patronage. Majority of the traders continue to live on the streets to this day, hawking used mechanical and electronic goods. Traffic The station has five platforms, viz., platform numbers 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, which are technically continuous with platforms in the M.G.R Chennai Central main railway station. With the laying of two additional lines in September 2016, there are now six lines running between the station and the Basin Bridge railway station. The station caters to about 275 train services daily and is used by about 200,000 passengers every day.

A film adaption, Buddha's Little Finger by Tony Pemberton, was released in 2015. Plot summary Graffiti based on the novel in Kharkiv, Ukraine The novel is written as a first-person narrative of Pyotr Pustota () and in the introduction to this book it is claimed that unlike Dmitriy Furmanov's book Chapayev, this book is the truth. The book is set in two different times ‚Äî after the October Revolution and in modern Russia. In the post-revolutionary period, Pyotr Pustota is a poet who has fled from Saint Petersburg to Moscow and who takes up the identity of a Soviet political commissar and meets a strange man named Vasily Chapayev who is some sort of an army commander. He spends his days drinking samogon, taking drugs and talking about the meaning of life with Chapayev. Every night (according to his post-revolutionary life) Pustota has nightmares about him being locked up in a psychiatric hospital because of his beliefs of being a poet from the beginning of the century. He shares the room in the hospital with three other men, each with his very individual form of fake identity. Until the end of the book it isn't perfectly clear, which of Pyotr's identities is the real one and whether there is such a thing as a real identity at all. Characters=Revolutionary periodPyotr= Pyotr is an unpolitical monarchist poet who is fleeing from the authorities. After murdering his former schoolmate chekist commander von Ernen he takes up von Ernen's checkist name Fanerny. Apartment he meets Chapayev and after a revolutionary performance which Pyotr does in a cabaret as Fanerny he is approached by Chapayev. Chapayev tells him that Pyotr (or Fanerny) is transferred to the Asian Cavalry division which is commanded by Chapayev. Everything that happens to him after boarding a train with Chapayev and his niece Anna is lost from Pyotr's memory after an injury he suffers in battle. Later he learns from other characters that he had become really close with Chapayev and had found answers to many questions. Pyotr falls in love with Anna who doesn't seem to find him attractive or interesting. He spends much time talking to Chapayev who is trying to explain the illusionary nature of the world to Pyotr. Pyotr's character is based on Pyotr Semenovich Isayev who was Chapayev's assistant in real life. =Chapayev=Anna=Kotovski=Baron Ungern=Furmanov=von ErnenModern RussiaPyotr= In modern Russia Pyotr wakes up in a psychiatric hospital and has only Pyotr's memories from the times of the revolution. From his case in the hospital he learns to know that he has had psychological pathologies since the age of fourteen. =Serdyuk= Semen Serdyuk is an inmate of the 17th psychiatric hospital who shares the room with Pyotr. He claims that he has been put in the hospital after a misunderstanding he had with some policeman over the illusionarity of the world while lying drunk in some basement. When he is put in a state similar to hypnosis he tells a different story - about himself applying for work in a Japanese firm and performing seppuku when the company that has hired him becomes a subject of a hostile takeover by an archrival company. =Volodin= Vladimir Volodin is a Russian gangster (so-called \\"New Russian\\") and Pyotr's fellow inmate. He and his two friends (or rather \\"business partners\\") had consumed numerous psychedelic mushrooms, which took them to a Valhalla-like place ruled by Baron Sternberg. =Maria= Maria or Simply Maria (a male character) is another roommate of Pyotr's in the psychiatric hospital.

While the exact date is not known, the Tablet is believed to have been written in 1865 to a Bah√° º√≠ from Yazd, Iran, named Ahmad. Bah√° º√≠s often recite it as a prayer to dispel afflictions and inspire perseverance in the face of hardships. In a letter written on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi stated that it has been 'invested by Bah√° ºu'll√°h with a special potency and significance'. The language and content of the Tablet are nuanced and interrelated, with references to core B√°b√≠ and Bah√°'√≠ hermeneutics. It announces the station of the B√°b as \\"the King of the Messengers,\\" and that of Bah√°'u'll√°h as \\"that Most Great Beauty, foretold in the Books of the Messengers,\\" and the \\"Tree of Life that bringeth forth the fruits of God.\\" The four conditions required to approach God and recognize His Messengers are defined as: sincerity, belief in the divine unity, severance and love. The freedom of individual conscience is reinforced in the pursuit of God and His Messengers, while obedience to the ordinances of God is enjoined, and that the truth of every command God ordains in these directives will be tested in one's life. Bah√°'u'll√°h then refers to His own tribulations and calls on Ahmad to rely upon God and to be steadfast in his love in times of difficulty and persecution. Bah√°'u'll√°h calls on Ahmad to \\"be as a flame of fire,\\" and \\"a river of life eternal\\" in response to his own suffering from the superstitions and oppression of others. The \\"flame of fire\\" refers to being steadfast in the truth in the face of difficulties caused by others, while the \\"river of life\\" refers to becoming a source of inspiration, guidance and upliftment to God's loved ones. The Tablet appears to revolve around the theme of transforming suffering into these virtuous qualities, symbolized as \\"fire\\" and \\"light\\", and \\"the fruits of God.\\" Bah√°'u'll√°h concludes the Tablet by enjoining Ahmad to \\"learn well\\" the lessons contained in the Tablet and not to withhold himself from their benefit. The special role of sincerity in life is disclosed in the text, not only as a condition for recognition of the \\"nearness of God,\\" but as the condition that leads to the relief of sadness and the resolution of difficulties. The Tablet can be seen as the outline of Bah√°'u'll√°h's theodicy, and is, therefore, used as a guide in times of personal trial to align one's inner life with the truths that \\"will be tested\\" in the process of turning personal suffering into \\"fire\\" and \\"light.\\" See also * Fire Tablet * Long Healing Prayer * Tablet of the Holy Mariner * Prayer in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith ReferencesFurther reading * Text online.

He played club level rugby union (RU) for Leinster Rugby, Clontarf FC, Leeds Tykes, and, Rotherham R.U.F.C., and club level rugby league (RL) for Castleford Panthers ARLFC, Leeds Rhinos, London Broncos, Castleford Tigers and Featherstone Rovers. He was born in Castleford. He currently plays for the Featherstone Rovers. Hepworth previously played for the Leeds Tykes, making his d√©but for them at Headingley Carnegie Stadium against London Welsh on 3 September 2006 at the start of the 2006‚Äì07 National League 1 season. He states his best team mate was Keiran Hickman. Leeds Rhinos Hepworth played junior rugby league for the Castleford Panthers ARLFC before joining Super League outfit Leeds Rhinos. He made only one appearance for the Rhinos, under coach Daryl Powell, before briefly joining the London Broncos on loan in 2002 and his hometown club the Castleford Tigers, also on loan, in 2003. Broncos coach Tony Rea said on the arrival of Hepworth in May 2002: \\"He's an exciting young player and will give us some nice back-up.\\" In 2011 he signed for Championship side the Featherstone Rovers becoming a key figure in their side. Castleford Tigers His move to Castleford Tigers was made permanent but when they were relegated from the Super League. In 2004 he switched codes and signed for Celtic League side Leinster, making six appearances and scoring one try. During his brief stint at the Castleford Tigers he was compared to Sean Long of St. Helens with his then coach Graham Steadman saying in April 2004: \\"I would compare Jonny Hepworth with the likes of Sean Long. He's got similar attributes, he's pacy, he has a quality kicking game and he supports well. What he lacks at the moment is that self-confidence and belief to take a game by the scruff of the neck. \\"He is in on merit because he is good enough and he's got to believe that. Obviously he's got to get game time and, on the back of that, the experience and confidence will come. He's got a great attitude and is certainly making good progress.\\" Hepworth captained the Leeds Rhinos Academy team when they beat local rivals the Bradford Bulls U-19 side in the Senior Academy Championship with a 12‚Äì7 victory in a brilliant Grand Final at Headingley in October 2002. He commented after the game: \\"We've worked hard all season and it's just what we wanted. They gave us everything in the first half and then we piled on the pressure and eventually got there. It was probably the biggest game of my life and it was great.\\" Leinster Before making his full d√©but for Leinster against Edinburgh in Dublin on 6 November 2005 he said: \\"Apart from playing for a local team in Wakefield when I was 15, coming on against Bath was my first competitive game. But I think I've adapted well and fitted in well here.\\" \\"I'm picking up bits as we go along and settling in well, hopefully I can make a full d√©but today and show what I can do.\\" \\"If I was switching to be a union forward it'd be difficult, but as a utility back in league you can fit in more quickly. In league there's not much kicking, it's mainly just torpedo kicks when you're punting.\\" \\"But here everyone can kick and our coach David Knox has been helping me out with that.\\" He also featured for Clontarf in North Dublin. He then signed for the Leeds Tykes, joining up again with Daryl Powell, the Leeds Tykes' first team coach. Hepworth joined the Rotherham R.U.F.C. for the 2010‚Äì11 RFU Championship, and made an immediate impression with his pace in possession and tenacious defence.

Its studios are located in the Students' Union building. It is the only licensed student station broadcasting in Northern Ireland, and one of several on the island.  History  Queen's Radio began broadcasting on 29 September 2003, initially over the Queen's University campus network and then the internet. In late 2005, the station was successful in acquiring a low-powered AM licence, allowing it to broadcast to Queen's Halls of Residence (Elms Village) directly via Medium Wave. This service commenced on 6 February 2006. Queen's Radio is operated by the 'Queen's University of Belfast Radio Club', which was originally formed in 1953, making it two years older than the independent student newspaper The Gown. The old Radio Club was a general purpose electronics, amateur radio and computer club, and provided facilities for students to pursue hobby interests in these areas and participated in amateur radio contests, etc. In the late 1990s the University evicted it from its premises in Fitzwilliam St and the club became almost dormant for several years. In 2001, the Radio Club was taken over by a group of students with the intention of forming a broadcast radio station, and giving QUB students experience of all aspects of broadcast radio. After two years of acquiring equipment, building up membership and negotiating with the Students' Union for premises, the station was ready to broadcast at the start of term in the 2003/04 academic year. The first live show was 'The Lunchbox' presented by Ian Llewellyn, although a pilot show had already been recorded by Shane Horan before the summer break. There was previously a temporary RSL (restricted service licence) FM radio station at Queen's called 'Fresh Air'. This operated during the first four weeks of term in September 1995 and was hosted by Cool FM DJs and some students, including the now BBC Radio Ulster presenter/producer Donna Legge, Citybeat presenter Stuart Robinson, P√°draig Mac Donnchadha and Downtown Radio DJ Lynda Cullan but was not set up or run by students at Queen's. Before Queen's Radio was set up in its current form, Queen's University had rejected a proposal from University staff to set up a station at Queen's - It was judged to be too expensive to set up and maintain. Now it is considered to be a major draw to the University to prospective undergraduates. In 2009 the station made headlines when it aired an advert for reducing carbon emissions which Sammy Wilson had banned from being broadcast in Northern Ireland.The Guardian, 14/02/2009 In late 2009 the station pulled its Medium Wave transmission but continued to broadcast via its online player available from the station's website. Currently, the station is managed by Jessica Lawrence (Station Manager), Rory Hughes (On-Air Manager) and Delphine Corr (Off-Air Manager).  Awards  In November 2005, the station was awarded the Gold Award for Best Technical Achievement for its computer-based Record of Transmission / Archiving system at the Student Radio Awards. In 2010 the station had three shows nominated for the Irish Smedia Awards. It also won Best Contribution to SU Media and the QUB Union awards, and was nominated for Most Improved Society of the Year. In April 2013, Queen's Radio DJ Christopher McBride was long listed for the Sony Golden Headphones Award for the UK's favourite presenter. In April 2017, Queen's Radio presenter Matthew Kirk was awarded the National Student Media (Smedia) award for Radio DJ of the Year. In March 2019, Queen's Radio's News and Current Affairs outlet, The Scoop, was nominated for the Student Media Outlet of the Year by the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) in their annual Student Achievement Awards Ireland ceremony.. In March 2019, Queen's Radio won the Queen's University Students' Union 'Society of the Year' award. In April 2019, Queen's Radio was nominated for the National Student Media award in the Radio Production of the Year ‚Äì News & Current Affairs category. The nomination was in recognition of their coverage of the 2018 United States Mid-Term Election cycle. The team included; Rory Hughes, Michael Jardine, Scott Duffield, Chloe Murray Jessica Lawerence, Jane Corscadden & Robert Murtagh. In April 2019, Queen's Radio received the QUBSU Society of the Year award at the Queen's University SU Awards, this was in recognition for the society's involvement with the Students' Union across the year and development of the society for its members.https://twitter.com/qubscreen/status/1109151469247389696?s=20 See also * List of student radio stations in the United Kingdom References External links  *Official Queen's Radio website Clubs and societies of Queen's University Belfast Radio stations in Northern Ireland Mass media in Belfast Student radio in the United Kingdom ","title":"Queen's Radio"},{"id":"9608686","text":"Peter Graulund (born 20 September 1976) is a Danish former professional footballer who played as a striker. He played for Danish clubs Vejle Boldklub, Br√∏ndby IF and AGF, German side VfL Bochum, and Swedish club Helsingborgs IF. He played six games and scored two goals for the Denmark national under-21 football team. Graulund was a fan favourite at AGF, not only because of his goal scoring abilities, but also due to his notorious fighting spirit. He was considered to be one of the best strikers in the Danish Superliga and is seventh on the list of top goalscorers all-time in the league. On 29 August 2011, he scored his 100th goal in the league in a win over AC Horsens. Graulund announced his retirement due to injuries on 12 October 2012.  Club career = Domestic success (1995‚Äì2001)  Born in Br√∏rup, Graulund played as a youth for Vejen SF and Kolding Boldklub before moving to Vejle Boldklub where he made his professional debut on 19 March 1995, aged 18, in a 1-0 win over Ikast FS. Head coach Ole Fritsen had promoted him to the first team, and he helped the club reach promotion to the Danish Superliga in his first season at the club. Before that, he had been a key player on the club's youth teams. In the 1996‚Äì97 season, he was part of the Vejle team that finished as runners- up in the Superliga alongside players such as Thomas Gravesen, Jesper S√∏gaard, Alex N√∏rlund and Jesper Mikkelsen. During that season, Graulund made 28 league appearances in which he scored five goals. In 1998, Graulund moved to Br√∏ndby IF, where he initially struggled. However, in the 2000‚Äì01 season, he began playing more regularly under head coach √Öge Hareide and finished a great season as top goalscorer in the Superliga.  Years abroad (2001‚Äì2004)  After becoming top scorer, Graulund signed with recently promoted German Bundesliga club VfL Bochum for DM 2.8 million, where he never got a breakthrough; after a long period as a reserve player, he was loaned out to AGF in February 2003. There, he had great success as a goal scorer, but when AGF due to a poor financial situation could not afford buy him out of his contract in Bochum, he instead continued his career with Swedish club Helsingborgs IF, where he played for two seasons.  AGF (2004‚Äì2012)  In 2006, Graulund returned to AGF, where he captained the first team until 2008. Steffen Rasmussen then took over the captains armband. A few weeks later, Graulund scored the winner against former club Br√∏ndby, which he later described as \\"saving my career at AGF\\", after the disappointment of losing his role as captain. His time at AGF was tumultuous, and the club suffered two relegations from the Superliga - in 2005‚Äì06 and 2009‚Äì10. The team bounced back in both seasons down in the second-tier 1st Division, with Graulund finishing as top goalscorer in both seasons. On 29 August 2011, Graulund scored his 100th goal in the Danish Superliga in a match against AC Horsens. On 26 October 2011, he tore one of his achilles tendons, which expected to keep him sidelined for nine months. Many experts therefore did not predict Graulund a comeback, as he was already 35 years old. However, Graulund returned to the pitch for AGF after only five months. In his first two matches after returning, he was substituted on with 30 minutes remaining, but managed to score in both matches, which AGF lost. On 12 October 2012, however, Graulund was forced to retire effective immediately. He could no longer keep playing after several serious injuries, including the torn achilles tendon the year before. He scored his last super league goal when AGF beat Silkeborg 4-0 on 1 September 2012. Graulund finished his career with 290 Danish Superliga appearance. With his 107 goals, he is number seven on the list of the top goalscorers in the league, surpassed only by Morten \\"Duncan\\" Rasmussen, S√∏ren Frederiksen, Peter M√∏ller, Heine Fernandez, Steffen H√∏jer and Frank Kristensen. Of all his appearances, 219 appearances and 100 goals were in the AGF jersey, 93 matches in the Vejle jersey, and 53 matches in the Br√∏ndby jersey. He also made 45 and 21 appearances for Helsingborgs IF and VfL Bochum, respectively. Besides his club career, Graulund gained six caps and scored two goals for the Denmark national under-21 team.

The first section of the road open to traffic was an eight-lane motorway connecting the southern section of the A118 beltway with two junctions at the Kirovsky and Moskovsky Districts, respectively. Other sections of the highway were under construction and eventually formed a corridor through the western districts of St. Petersburg to cross the northern portion of the A118 beltway in Yuntolovo and to meet the E-18/M-10 route at the Beloostrov junction. A new 4-km-long section of the highway was slated to open in late 2011. It connects the northern terminus of the first open segment with the industrial western part of the Kirovsky district which hosts the port of St. Petersburg. A 25-km-long section running from Beloostrov to the Primorsky District was scheduled to open in late 2012. The overall length of the Western High-Speed Diameter highway was projected at upon the scheduled completion in 2013 - 2014. A discount is given during the overnight hours (11 pm - 7 am) and for the vehicles equipped with a transponder. WHSD cost 210 billion rubles. In December, 2016 the whole motorway was open for traffic. The Western High-Speed Diameter is the most popular road in Russia with more than 380,000 payments per day. The unique objects were created within the construction of the Western High-Speed Diameter, including the longest bridge constructions in Russia (except the Crimean bridge): the Southern Flyover of the main road route over the Sea channel and Korabelny fairway ‚Äì 9,4 km and the Northern Flyover of the main road route over the Petrovsky fairway and Elagin fairway ‚Äì 8,8 km. The Western High-Speed Diameter is an inner-city multilane highway, which made it possible to cross a 5-million metropolis in 20 minutes and provides 24-hour transport link between southern and northern districts of St. Petersburg. The highway ensures the transport accessibility of the Sea port areas, unloads the historic center of the city, the Ring Road and the road network. For the first time ever, thanks to WHSD implementation all districts of St. Petersburg became accessible to drivers 24/7. The Western High-Speed Diameter is divided into three sections: Southern, Central and Northern. The Central section mostly consists of the unique bridgeworks such as a cable-stayed bridge over the Korabelny fairway, a cable-stayed bridge over the Petrovsky fairway and a double-deck bridge over the Sea channel. The Central section of WHSD incorporates a whole complex of artificial structures and is considered the most challenging part of the road in respect of engineering solutions and construction process. Description left The Western High-Speed Diameter is a 46.6-kilometre road with a total length, including all exit and entry ramps and interchanges, of over 70 kilometres. It features 15 interchanges, and its width varies from four to eight lanes. The new road is expected to ease congestion in the historic centre of St Petersburg, the St Petersburg Ring Road and road network, enabling drivers to cross the city in less than 20 minutes.  The main objects of the Central Section of the WHSD = Cable-stayed bridge over the Korabelny Fairway  An unusual design was chosen for the Korabelny bridge. Each pylon column is inclined inwards and also towards the bridge centre line. Such an architectural solution repeats the geometry of a drawbridge, one of the most recognizable symbols of St. Petersburg. * bridge length - 620 m * length of central span - 320 m * bridge undercelarance - 35 m  Cable-stayed bridge over the Petrovsky Fairway  For the bridge over Petrovsky fairway an interesting engineering solution was suggested ‚Äì a fan arrangement of the cable-stays. Such an intertwining of the threads provides the bridge an original, airy outlook. * bridge length - 580 m * length of central span - 240 m * bridge underclearance - 25 m  Double-deck bridge over the Sea channel  The superstructure of the bridge is a 6-m-deep truss with spans of up to 168m, The bridge crosses Kanonersky Island and the main channel to the port at a maximum clearance of 52 m. It is the highest bridge in St. Petersburg. In December 2019, a nuclear-powered icebreaker Arktika successfully passed under the bridge, the height of which coincides with the height of the icebreaker. * ship clearance ‚Äì 52 m * overall length ‚Äì 720 m * central span length ‚Äì 168 m The bridges of the Western High-Speed Diameter now can be regarded as other architectural symbols of St. Petersburg as an example of harmonious urban development. The cable-stayed bridges became sites of attraction to citizens and tourists. For example, the Korabelny bridge. From the coastal part of Primorsky Victory Park one can see the beautiful Petrovsky bridge, which harmoniously fit into the city skyline. Environmental Impact Central part of Western High-Speed Diameter Part of the toll highway will run near the Yuntolovo Nature Reserve on the northern outskirts of St Petersburg. From the outset, the road construction project has caused significant public concern about a negative impact on the ecology of the reserve, as well as possible rezoning of areas of the nature reserve for commercial and residential development. Concerned citizens have formed a movement to save the forest and swampland of the nature reserve from harmful construction projects along the route of the new highway.  Managing company  The Western High-Speed Diameter is operated by NCH, LLC. According to the PPPA, NCH attracted funding for construction of the Central Section of WHSD. NCH also operates WHSD under the 30 years Concession.  CEO  Alexey Bnatov was born in Moscow, 1959.

It closed in 1930, and was delisted in 1947. The park land had functioned as a pronghorn reserve beginning in 1914. Menissawok National Park was one of several national parks created in the Prairies expressly to protect and regenerate dangerously low populations of bison and pronghorn. Other 'regeneration' parks, also delisted in 1947, included Buffalo National Park, Wawaskesy National Park, and Nemiskam National Park (all in Alberta). Menissawok is a Cree First Nations word meaning \\"common or national property\\" (the nearest Cree term for \\"national park\\"). The area was one of three pronghorn reserves in Saskatchewan, along with the Old Wives Lake reserve, southwest of Moose Jaw, and the temporary Big Stick Lake reserve, in the same region as Menissawok. With the rebound of pronghorn herds in southern Saskatchewan and Alberta, Menissawok and several other small \\"Dominion Parks\\" were closed when the National Parks Act was updated on May 30, 1930. The land comprising Menissawok National Park was turned over to the province of Saskatchewan. While human activity has returned, areas along waterways are covered by trees. References *Lothian, W.F.

Russian bank Globex barred customers from withdrawing money from their accounts on October 15, 2008, in the first bank run of the current global economic crisis. 2010s In June 2013 Elvira Nabiullina was appointed to the chairman of the Central Bank of Russia.

She added that the Central Bank will not warn any bank about such measures. She said \\"As a matter of fact, no one knows who might be the next, We cannot warn anyone. Moreover, it would be wrong to do that. I know not a single country worldwide where the central banks would warn about license revocation. It is not ruled out that in case a bank is warned, a mala fide owner or managers could divert assets, making settlements with closest clients, so a rank and file depositor will finally receive much less money\\".

History The land for an aerodrome was purchased by the London & Provincial Aviation Company (Warren and Smiles - Michael Geoffrey Smiles of Bonnington died in 1921) in October 1915. The company used the aerodrome for flying training during the First World War. London & Provincial ceased flying in July 1919 after a dispute with Department of Civil Aviation (see United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority), which refused them a licence. Stag Lane became the main base of The de Havilland Aircraft Company Limited in 1920 and they purchased the freehold in 1922. Former wartime aircraft were refurbished in the early years, and the company designed and built large numbers of aircraft at Stag Lane in the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1934 the company moved to a larger factory and airfield at Hatfield Aerodrome, Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Stag Lane Aerodrome was sold for housing development in 1933, though a small site was retained as a factory and offices for the de Havilland Engine Company Limited. The last flight from the airfield was a de Havilland Hornet Moth in July 1934.

A cell membrane is typically labeled with a fluorescent dye to allow for observation. A specific area of this labeled section is then bleached several times using the beam of a confocal laser scanning microscope. After each imagining scan, bleaching occurs again. This occurs several times, to ensure that all accessible fluorophores are bleached since unbleached fluorophores are exchanged for bleached fluorophores, causing movement through the cell membrane. The amount of fluorescence from that region is then measured over a period of time to determine the results of the photobleaching on the cell as a whole. Experimental Setup Before photobleaching can occur, cells must be injected with a fluorescent protein, often a green fluorescent protein (GFP), which will allow the targeted proteins to fluoresce and therefore be followed throughout the process. Then, a region of interest must be defined. This initial region of interest usually contains the whole cell or several cells. In FLIP, photobleaching occurs just outside the region of interest; therefore a photobleaching region also needs to be defined. A third region, the region where measurement will take place, needs to be determined as well. A number of initial scans need to be made to determine fluorescence before photobleaching. These scans will serve as the control scans, to which the photobleached scans will be compared later on. Photobleaching can then occur. Between each bleach pulse, it is necessary to allow time for recovery of fluorescent material. It is also important to take several scans of the region of interest immediately after each bleach pulse for further study. The change in fluorescence at the region of interest can then be quantified in one of three ways. The most common is to choose the location, size and number of the regions of interest based on visual inspection of the image sets. The two other, rather new but more reliable approaches are either by detecting areas of different probe mobility on an individual image basis or by physical modeling of fluorescence loss from moving bodies. Loss of fluorescence is defined by the mobile fraction, or the fraction of fluorophores capable of recovering into a photobleached area, of the fluorescently labeled protein. Incomplete loss of fluorescence indicates that there are fluorophores that do not move or travel to the bleached area. This allows for definition of the immobile fraction, or the fraction of fluorophores incapable of recovering into a photobleached area, of fluorescent-labeled proteins. Immobility indicates that there are proteins that may be in compartments closed off from the rest of the cell, preventing them from being affected by the repeated photobleaching. Applications=Verifying Continuity of Membranous Organelles The primary use of FLIP is to determine the continuity of membranous organelles. This continuity or lack thereof is determined by observing the amount of fluorescence in the region of interest. If there is a complete loss of fluorescence, this indicates that the organelles are continuous. However, if there is incomplete loss of fluorescence, then there is not continuity between the organelles. Instead, these organelles are compartmentalized and therefore closed off to the transfer of any photobleached fluorophores. Continuity of the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus have been verified using FLIP. Exchange Rate Between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm Two of the other, less frequently employed uses of FLIP are to determine how proteins are shuttled from the Cytoplasm to the Nucleus and then determine the rate at which this shuttling occurs. To determine what portions are involved and when in the shuttling process they are involved, continuous scans are observed. The sooner a part of the cytoplasm is used in the shuttling process, the more rapidly it experiences complete loss of fluorescence. The resulting image of this process should be a completely photobleached cytoplasm. If the cell also participates in nuclear export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, photobleaching will also occur in the nucleus. The exchange rate between the nucleus and cytoplasm can also be determined from this type of data. In these instances, the region of photobleaching is within the nucleus. If shuttling occurs at a rapid pace, the fluorescence levels within the nuclear compartments will decrease rapidly through the frames taken. However, if shuttling occurs slowly, the fluorescence levels will remain unaffected or decrease only slightly. FLIP vs. FRAP FLIP is often used and is closely associated with Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The major difference between these two microscopy techniques is that FRAP involves the study of a cell‚Äôs ability to recover after a single photobleaching event whereas FLIP involves the study of how the loss of fluorescence spreads throughout the cell after multiple photobleaching events. This difference in purpose also leads to a difference in what parts of the cell are observed. In FRAP, the area that is actually photobleached is the area of interest. Conversely, in FLIP, the region of interest is just outside the region that is being photobleached. Another important difference is that in FRAP, there is a single photobleaching event and a recovery period to observe how well fluorophores move back to the bleached site. However, in FLIP, multiple photobleaching events occur to prevent the return of unbleached fluorophores to the bleaching region. Like FLIP, FRAP is used in the study of continuity of membranous organelles. FLIP and FRAP are often used together to determine the mobility of GFP-tagged proteins. FLIP can also be used to measure the molecular transfer between regions of a cell regardless of the rate of movement. This allows for a more comprehensive analysis of protein trafficking within a cell. This differs from FRAP which is primarily useful for determining mobility of proteins in regions local to the photobleaching only. Potential Complications There are several complications that are involved with both FLIP and FRAP. Since both forms of microscopy examine living cells, there is always the possibility that the cells will move, causing false results. The best way to avoid this is to use an alignment algorithm, which will compensate for any movement and eliminate a large portion of the error due to movement. In these experiments, it is also key to have a control group in order to adjust the results and correct the recovery curve for the overall loss in fluorescence. Another way to minimize error is to keep photobleaching contained to a single region or area. This limitation will serve as a control and limit fluorescence loss due to photo-damage as compared to fluorescence loss due to the photobleaching.

The parish is recorded as king's land in the custody of Godric; from Count Alan and Ribald. The Second World War During the summer of 1940 Matlaske became home to a satellite airfield to RAF Coltishall which is located south east of the village.Norfolk Airfields in the Second World War:By Graham Smith:Published by Countryside Books, 2007 By October 1940 two grass runways were in operation here. On 27 October Coltishall was bombed which instigated the Spitfires of No 27 squadron to be the first operational aircraft at Matlaske. Two days after the move Matlaske itself was attacked by the Luftwaffe when five enemy aircraft strafed the field causing slight damage to the parked Spitfires and causing some casualties to people. In November 1941 Westland Whirlwinds of 137 squadron were moved from Coltishall to Matlaske. On 12 February 1942 the Whirlwinds were sent on an operation to prevent the Channel dash of the German warships , and from Brest to the safety of German north sea ports. Four out of the six Whirlwinds were lost during the action. In September 1942 the airfield was offered to USAAF as base for one of their fighter groups, which was not taken up. In August 1944 the airfield was closed to flying. By September 1944 it was re-opened with No 150 Wing of the Second Tactical Air Force taking up residence using Mustang III's. In October Spitfires where back on the base with 229, 453 and 602 Squadrons. They launched missions from Matlaske to the continent to try to destroy V-2 rocket sites. The last operational sorties were launched from Matlaske by the Spitfires of 453 squadron in April 1945. After the squadron left the base was deserted and was quickly given up by the RAF and was one of the first airfields to be handed back to farming.

The church was restored in 1878. The building is constructed from coursed flint work with some stone dressing on the roof where there are plain and fish scale tiles. Most of the roof dates from 1878 and is supported on corbels carved with rustic faces, dating from the medieval period, although the roof of the south aisle dates from 1710. The font dates from the 15th century. On one wall is a restored canvas with the royal coat of arms of George III. In front of the sanctuary hangs a large brass chandelier. Barningham Hall A short distance North West of the village is the Barningham estate and within it Barningham Hall, a grade I listed building. The mansion was built in 1612 for Sir Edward Paston, constructed in red brick and stone and is a fine example of Jacobean architecture. The west elevation has a three-storey porch tower with two- storied dormer windows. The south elevation was remodelled in 1805 by Humphrey and John Adey Repton. They also installed a central oriel window and extra bay windows and had a hand in much of the interior work although there is panelling and plasterwork which date back to the 17th century. The landscaped grounds are also the work of the Reptons. They created the park, lake and woodlands and set out the terrace on the south of the house. An avenue of oak trees leads to the west front of the hall. There is also a walled kitchen garden.

Members are of all ages, although mainly due to the long-running nature of the network it is most popular with women over 30 years old. It is often the only lesbian social outlet in areas where there is not much visible gay and lesbian presence.  Members  Throughout the country the local groups are managed by a network volunteers, who organise discos, club nights, walks, reading groups, golf tournaments, discussion groups and other such events to suit the locality. These women are from all walks of life, professions, ages and social backgrounds. Members of the network keep in touch via a national monthly magazine, as well as regional newsletters. The basic philosophy is that no lesbian should feel isolated or alone, no matter where they are. The group now has over 1200 subscribers, located all over the country and overseas.  Major events  Each year the organisation hosts major event that include a Christmas ball in London and an event in Eastbourne to mark the end of the International Women's Open tennis tournament. These events are open to women who are both members and non- members.  History  Many of the early members of Kenric were members of the Gateways club in Chelsea.

Chemically, it is the triphosphate derivative of the vitamin thiamine. Function It has been proposed that ThTP has a specific role in nerve excitability, but this has never been confirmed and recent results suggest that ThTP probably plays a role in cell energy metabolism. Low or absent levels of thiamine triphosphate have been found in Leighs disease. In E. coli, ThTP is accumulated in the presence of glucose during amino acid starvation. On the other hand, suppression of the carbon source leads to the accumulation, of adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP). Metabolism It has been shown that in brain ThTP is synthesized in mitochondria by a chemiosmotic mechanism, perhaps similar to ATP synthase. In mammals, ThTP is hydrolyzed to thiamine pyrophosphate (ThDP) by a specific thiamine-triphosphatase. It can also be converted into ThDP by thiamine-diphosphate kinase. History Thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) was chemically synthesized in 1948 at a time when the only organic triphosphate known was ATP. The first claim of the existence of ThTP in living organisms was made in rat liver, followed by baker‚Äôs yeast. Its presence was later confirmed in rat tissues and in plants germs, but not in seeds, where thiamine was essentially unphosphorylated. In all those studies, ThTP was separated from other thiamine derivatives using a paper chromatographic method, followed by oxidation in fluorescent thiochrome compounds with ferricyanide in alkaline solution. This method is at best semi- quantitative, and the development of liquid chromatographic methods suggested that ThTP represents far less than 10% of total thiamine in animal tissues.

It is an insect-transmitted maize pathogen in the genus Mastrevirus of the family Geminiviridae that is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and neighbouring Indian Ocean island territories such as Madagascar, Mauritius and La Reunion. The A-strain of MSV (MSV-A) causes sporadic maize streak disease epidemics throughout the maize growing regions of Africa. MSV was first described by the South African entomologist Claude Fuller who referred to it in a 1901 report as \\"mealie variegation\\". The development of conventionally resistant maize varieties has been a priority since the 1950s in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and elsewhere, with a good deal of success: however, there are several genes associated with resistance, and breeding is complex. Transgenically resistant or genetically modified maize varieties were under development in South Africa, but the project has terminated without field trials of the candidate maize lines that were developed. MSV is mainly transmitted by Cicadulina mbila Naude, but other leafhopper species, such as C. storeyi, C. arachidis and C. dabrowski, are also able to transmit the virus. Typical of all mastreviruses, MSV's circular, ~2.7-Kb monopartite single-stranded (ss) DNA genome encodes only four proteins. Bidirectional transcription from a long intergenic region (LIR) results in the virion-sense expression of a movement protein (MP) and a coat protein (CP), and the complementary-sense expression of the replication-associated proteins, Rep and RepA. Whereas the MP and CP are involved in virus movement and encapsidation, Rep is an essential initiator of virus replication, and RepA is a regulator of host and viral gene transcription. Due to genome size restrictions, MSV usurps host DNA replication and double-stranded DNA break repair proteins to replicate its genome via, respectively, rolling-circle and recombination- dependent mechanisms.

During this time she had to deal with her jealous, possibly violent, and ultimately unfaithful ADA husband Don, whom she tossed out and began divorce proceedings against after she caught him in the act, but Don was later murdered by the husband of the married woman he'd been cheating on Rita with. After some time to get over Don's death, she became involved with John Clark, Jr.. Her relationship with Clark floundered and then fell apart when he pushed her away after the suicide of his father. She requested a transfer out of the 15th from Tony Rodriguez but changed her mind after she saved the Lt.'s life. Her next relationship was also within the squad, this time with Lt. Rodriguez; he had decided to leave the NYPD and they began seriously dating as he took a private sector position. It was revealed a year later that she was again single, the assumption being that the relationship had ended in the interim. After McDowell's departure she was partnered up with Laura Murphy for the show's final season. After some initial scepticism on Ortiz's part, especially about what she perceived to be Murphy's flirting, by the end of the show they had become a good team.

During the Soviet era, it was renamed Zhdanov (–ñ–¥–∞–Ω–æ–≤, also Jdanov, Zhdanov, ≈Ωdanovsk, and Zhdanovsk) after Stalinist politician Andrei Zhdanov. This move was reverted in 1991 when the city assumed its original name again. Beylagan is one of the oldest towns in Azerbaijan. It is located in the triangle between the Kura and Aras rivers in the Mil plain.  Economy  23 industrial enterprises were registered in the Beylagan region.

History  Some historians say that Beylagan is to have been founded by the Sassanid emperor Qobad and it may have been built during the time of Iranian migration and colonization of the region. In pre-Islamic times the city was known as Paytakaran. During the sixth century 'Paidangaran' (as its name is recorded in Syriac) was a diocese of the Assyrian Church of the East, two of whose bishops are known.Fiey, Pour un Oriens Christianus Novus, 119 The city surrendered peacefully to the Arabs and a period of Islamisation ensued, in which the city of Paytakaran became known as Baylaqan. Muslim chronicles describe it as a flourishing city. In the 12th century, the city had to pay tribute to Georgia and was sacked in 1220 by the Mongols, who slaughtered the inhabitants and burned it down. However, survivors subsequently returned and rebuilt it.Encyclopedia Iranica. C. E. Bosworth. Baylaqan At the end of the 14th century it was destroyed by Timur, who later rebuilt it, but the city was abandoned.

Career = Entertainment  In several films, Kong depicted a wealthy wife scorned and other romantic characters. Kong's film career ran throughout the 1950s, at a time when mainstream cinema in Hong Kong was just beginning to challenge the conservative Asian culture. In the films, Kong is credited as Yee Mui or Mui Yee. In 1960, after Kong was diagnosed with tongue cancer, she retired from acting and decided to become a preacher as which she acted for about seven years.  Christian leader  In 1963, facing certain death, Kong turned from a worldly lifestyle to religion and reacted to the Pentecostal revival which had reached Asia to start a Church called the New Testament Church (NTC). She was appointed a prophetess and an Apostle by God to continue the work of the book of Acts in the Bible. In addition to teaching \\"speaking in tongues\\" as a means of salvation, she began promulgating \\"The Blood, Water and Holy Spirit\\", of which God had inspired her from her Bible readings of 1 John 5:6-8, but is actually a teaching that many Christians have always held dear: that Jesus shed His blood for the remission of sins, began His ministry when He was baptized, and ended His ministry when He sent down the Holy Spirit to build His church on the Day of Pentecost. (It is believed by Bible scholars that the Apostle John wrote this letter to refute some erroneous beliefs of the Gnostics that Jesus was just a man and not God-in-the-flesh.) Kong also taught her primarily female followers (of which several were former fans) teachings that bordered on numerology, including the \\"7.21 Inspiration\\" (referring to July 21), which she dubbed the \\"rebuilding of the New Testament Church by the Holy Spirit.\\" Yee prophesied that her religious group would become famous and cause worldwide revival. Upon her gruesome death, she was succeeded by her daughter Ruth Chang. But soon afterwards Ruth was convinced by her husband that her mother's teachings were heretical and that the NTC sect is a cult. Chang then moved to Southern California and became a pastor of a Pentecostal Christian church (Assemblies of God). Elijah Hong then succeeded her.  Personal  Kong battled with tongue cancer.

He then became a Calvinist minister. He moved to Cologne, where he perhaps met Theodore Haak who was there in 1626.Young, p.12. He gave up the ministry and returned to his native Nuremberg in 1627, then full of refugees from the Thirty Years War.Young p.13. He met Isaac Beeckman in Dordrecht in 1633.Young p.21. He at this time was involved in practical aspects of optics and Paracelsian chemistry and medicine. He moved permanently to the Netherlands five years later. In 1657 he is recorded as the owner of a scarlet dye works in Hulkestein near Arnhem. His Dutch connections included the Hebraist Adam Boreel,PDF, p.245. and businessman Louis de Geer, a supporter of Comenius.

Together with Clark, she wrote the 1990 West End musical Someone Like You. Career=Early acting and singing Shipman began her professional career as an actress and singer, both in the theatre, and on TV, where she appeared in series such as The Avengers (Propellant 23) and Emergency - Ward 10. She then went on to a successful career in radio, including co-presenting a weekly series for the BBC Teen Scene, and having two series of her own for Radio Luxembourg, Ready Steady Radio and Kids Like Us. During this period, Shipman was signed to Decca Records, and released a cover of Mel Torm√©‚Äôs hit \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" under the name Deanna Shenderey. She also wrote for the magazine Pop Weekly, in which she had her own weekly column. As a singer, Shipman recorded a twelve track LP, produced by Norman Newell. The album featured such evergreen standards as \\"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\\", \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" and \\"One Hand, One Heart\\". The album was released in July 2008 by Stage Door Records. Titled She Isn't Me, the reissue concludes with a new recording from Shipman and Roger Webb's musical Emma. Shipman made several films, which included starring as Mrs. Burke in the 1972 motion picture Burke And Hare opposite Harry Andrews and Derren Nesbitt, and which she described as \\"Glamorous no! Culture no! But fun? YES!\\" Songwriting Shipman first started writing lyrics when she began her song-writing collaboration with composer Roger Webb. Their output included writing \\"Sad Song Lady\\" for Blossom Dearie, \\"The Rainbow Bridge\\" for Danny Williams and \\"Making It By Myself\\" for the Kenneth Tynan and Clifford Williams musical Carte Blanche at the Phoenix Theatre in London. The show was not well reviewed, but the song got good notices. Shipman and Webb also composed music and lyrics for three musical concepts: A Kid For Two Farthings (based on the 1955 film of the Wolf Mankowitz modern classic story); The Last Touring Love Show; and Emma (based on the life of Emma Hamilton). Shipman went on to write songs with Marc Wilkinson (for the nude review Carte Blanche, 1976), Werner Becker, George Garvarentz, Albert Van Dam, Ralph Lewin and Herbert Chappell. =Collaborations with Charles Aznavour and Petula Clark= In 1976, Shipman began an important partnership with Charles Aznavour, which continued into their latter years. Their songwriting together produced the Aznavour favourite \\"Pretty Shitty Days\\", as well as \\"A Very Private Christmas\\" and \\"You Make Me Hungry For Your Loving\\" amongst many others. It was Aznavour who introduced Shipman to Petula Clark; Shipman and Clark wrote their first song together in 1978, and remained friends and partners. The Clark ‚Äì Shipman partnership produced the original stage musical Someone Like You, which toured the United Kingdom and transferred to the West End in 1990. Shipman and Clark also wrote over 50 songs together for Clark's commercial albums and singles plus their second, uncompleted musical Zola, based on the life of √âmile Zola. Two songs from the score can be heard on the CD In Her Own Write, released by Sepia Records in 2007. In 1989, while continuing to write all Aznavour's English lyrics, and also working on two musicals with Clark, Shipman wrote the script and co-produced the TV docudrama Petain, charting the life of Philippe P√©tain. The film featured Harry Andrews as Petain, in his last film role. (Portions of the film's score, composed by Clark, can be heard on In Her Own Write.) Aznavour and Shipman together also devised and wrote the songs for a musical workshop of Molly Bloom's Soliloquy from James Joyce‚Äôs Ulysses, which was performed at the Edinburgh International Festival by Eartha Kitt. Aznavour's musical Lautrec, with English lyrics by Shipman, premiered at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth in March 2000 before transferring to the Shaftesbury Theatre, London. The duo were said to be working together on several new songs to have been included in a US and Canadian production of the show. Neuro-linguistic programming Shipman was a NLP (Neuro-linguistic programming) Master Coach, Trainer, and Master Practitioner, and a partner with Paul Jacobs in New Oceans. Together they ran regular Life, Business, Education, Coaching, and Performing & Creative Arts trainings, workshops, and seminars, and were also successful life coaches. In 2006, Shipman and Wes McGhee co-wrote the CD NLP Songs For Change, a musical introduction to the tools and techniques of NLP. Shipman also wrote three books of short stories, based on her NLP experiences: The Sunbeam Collection Vol.1, The Sunbeam Collection Vol.2, and All We Are Is Our Stories. Vol.1 Prior to her death, she was writing Volume 2 of the latter title, and also working on The Book Of Inspirational Parenting. Personal life and death Shipman died on 11 June 2020.

It was established in August 2014 on the merging of Worcester College of Technology and North East Worcestershire College (commonly abbreviated to NEW College).  History = North East Worcestershire College  The logo of North East Worcestershire College North East Worcestershire College (NEW College) was founded in 1988 from the merger of North Worcestershire College and Redditch College of Further Education. It had campuses at Redditch and Bromsgrove which also offered outreach courses in community and employer premises across Worcestershire. Enrolment was open to anyone aged 16 and over and during the year 2009 -2010 there were around 3000 full-time and 6000 part-time students enrolled at the college. In addition to full and part-time courses, the college offered apprenticeship training in subjects that included Accounting, Business Administration, Child-Care, Construction Trades, Engineering, Hairdressing, Health and Social Care and Motor Vehicle Engineering. In an Ofsted inspection in 2010 inspectors assessed the college's overall performance as \\"good, with outstanding features\\" describing the college as \\"a lively, modern, safe and friendly place to study\\". Over a ten-year period investments totalling ¬£40m were made in upgrading existing buildings and substantial new build projects in both Redditch and Bromsgrove. The college was noted for its development of innovative projects with private and public sector partners including Artrix the Bromsgrove Arts Centre and a Harley- Davidson European Training Centre that provided training for Harley-Davidson technicians from the UK, Europe and the Middle East. The college was designated as an LSIS 'Beacon' college. In 2011, NEW College opened a ¬£3.5m extension which included a new TV studio, Music Centre and Games/Interactive Media studio. In November 2012, the Foundation Degree Media Moving Image students, created an animated music video featuring the song \\"All the Broken Toys at Christmas\\" and toys such as Action Man, Barbie and Scalextric, to raise money for Sense for the Christmas period. At the world premiere of the music video, held at the college on 28 November, two days before its official release, Virginia Von Malachowski, a manager from Sense was present and praised the project.  Worcester College of Technology (aka Worcester College or Worcester Tech)  The logo of Worcester College of Technology The college had its origin in a School of Design which was opened in Pierpoint Street, Worcester, in 1851. In 1894, a School of Science and Art was built in Sansome Walk as part of the Victoria Institute and this served as the headquarters of the college until 1962 when the new buildings in Deansway were occupied. In 1991, the college adopted its current name of Worcester College of Technology. The college also had two main sites including its Art and Design and Sports departments (including beauty courses) on Barbourne Road, about a mile from the City Centre, and at other locations in the city. The Victoria Institute, home of the college from 1894 to 1962, photographed in 2009 In 1939 the annual College enrolment was around 600 students, most of whom attended evening classes. This had risen to 15,000 enrolled students in 2006, including 3,000 full-time students. Around 1,000 of the students were studying for Higher Education Qualifications. The college included a Sixth Form Centre, offering A-Levels and other qualifications. No state schools in Worcester had sixth forms, and so it was one of only two Sixth Form Centres in the city. In 2014 the college received \\"Good\\" in their Ofsted inspection, which was a clear improvement from their previous grade of \\"Satisfactory\\". The inspection report stated the following: \\"Students develop very good personal, social and employability skills through clearly developed study programmes, particularly for those aged 16 to 18 year olds, which include a qualification in job search and interview skills. Carefully planned work experience, in real work environments, accurately matches students courses and to their future aspirations.\\" = Barbourne College = It originally opened in 1929 as the third site of the Worcester Secondary School for Girls. In September 1945, it became the City of Worcester Grammar School for Girls and in 1962 it was moved across the city to the site of the current Worcester Sixth Form College. It merged with the School of Science and Art and became an Art and Design College up to 1991 when the college adopted its name to Worcester College of Technology, and the Barbourne College became the Art, Design and Sports department. It ran many courses including Media Production, Graphic Design, Photography, Make-up and Hair and Beauty. It stayed that way until it closed in 2014 and the college was moved to the old Russell and Dorrell building in the city centre as the college changed its name to the Heart of Worcestershire College after it merged with North East Worcestershire College in August 2014. Much of the Barbourne building has been knocked down and turned into an apartment building for old people. The front of the building still has not changed since its opening.  Heart of Worcestershire College  On 1 August 2014, North East Worcestershire College (NEW College) and Worcester College of Technology formally amalgamated. The decision, was agreed by both corporations, and the name was approved by the appointed Skills Minister, Nicholas Boles. Name of the college The first name proposed for the merged college was Worcestershire College, but this was rejected by the then Skills Minister, Matthew Hancock. During the consultation phase of the merger Sir Peter Luff, the MP for Mid-Worcestershire, complained that Worcestershire College made it sound like it was the only college in the county and that this would be unfair to South Worcestershire College and Warwickshire College, who both have campuses in Worcestershire.

Its St Dunstan's Building is dedicated to its creative arts and hair and beauty provision. Short-listed for the prestigious AJ Retrofit Awards, this modern building has a commercial salon, Fountains, art and design studios and coffee shop. In 2017, the college teamed up with Freedom Leisure and Worcester City Council to develop brand new sports facilities exclusively for its students at Perdiswell Leisure Club. Facilities include: fitness studios, football pitch and bespoke teaching classrooms. Northbrook Automotive Centre is home to the college's automotive workshops and offers students the opportunity to enhance their studies by applying classroom based learning in a practical environment. Working on real vehicles in the workshop, students can build on their knowledge of key vehicle systems, identify and rectify faults, conduct diagnostic checks and learn how to remove and repair engines.

Famous for its long pond of giant water lilies (Victoria amazonica), the garden was first constructed by Pierre Poivre (17191786) in 1770, and it covers an area of around .

On 17 September 1988 the garden was formally named ‚ÄúSir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanic Garden‚Äù, named after the first prime minister of Mauritius, as was the smaller SSR Botanical Garden of Curepipe. In addition to its giant waterlilies, the garden also features spices, ebonies, sugar canes, and 85 varieties of palms from Central America, Asia, Africa and the islands around the Indian Ocean. Many trees have been planted by world leaders and royalty, including Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, Indira Gandhi, Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Robert Mugabe.Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Garden Mysterra Magazine These gardens are situated in the village of Pamplemousses which lies about seven miles northeast of the capital, Port Louis. Pamplemousse or pamplemoucier is the grapefruit tree (Citrus x paradisi), which grows in the region, possibly introduced by the Dutch from Java. Associated property Mon Plaisir The gardens, which now cover an area of about , were set aside on 8 June 1729 for colonist P. Barmont 'barmond', who sold it on 3 January 1735 to Claude N. de Maupin, an overseer in the royal French East India Company. Subsequently, there were several other owners, and by 1805, the land had increased to about . By 1868, the gardens themselves occupied , with later additions to a total of . Only of garden remain, the rest being an experimental station. Establishment The origin of the Royal Botanic Gardens of Pamplemousses can be traced to the first and most famous French Governor of Mauritius, Mah√© de La Bourdonnais at a time when the island was known as Isle de France. In 1735, Labourdonnais bought the property Ch√¢teau Mon Plaisir and created a vegetable garden to provide produce for his household, the young township of Port Louis, and the ships landing on the island. If this garden counts as precursor to the present garden, then Pamplemousses is the oldest botanical garden in the former British territories. On the other hand, its origin is often traced to 1768, when Pierre Poivre became director. Either way, it was one of the oldest and the most remarkable botanical collections in the tropics. Function View of the giant water lilies (Victoria amazonica) pond. Pamplemousses was probably the earliest of the ‚Äòbotanical gardens‚Äô in the tropics; an 18th-century garden maintained as a nursery for the acclimatization of potential crop plants from overseas ‚Äì although its status as a botanic garden is disputed.Hyams, Edward. 1969. Great Botanical Gardens of the World. London: Nelson. p. 220. These gardens sometimes acquired botanical status under the directorship of a botanist who would establish a herbarium. Pamplemousses is still a beautiful and interesting garden but without either herbarium or glasshouses.Hyams, Edward. 1969. Great Botanical Gardens of the World. London: Nelson. p. 220. Map showing the extent of the Garden. The garden was also used as a nursery for the planting and acclimatization of plants of botanical and economic importance that were introduced mostly from Europe and the East. Chief among the first introductions was cassava (manioc), which Labourdonnais brought from Brazil to provide food for the island's slaves. In 1739, the French East India Company took possession of Mon Plaisir and almost the entire estate was planted with mulberry trees in the hope of establishing a silkworm industry. Subsequently, the mulberries were replaced by a plantation of bois noir (Albizia lebbeck), the charcoal of which could be used in the manufacture of gunpowder. The French had taken possession of the island as a naval base and the administration was geared towards taking precautions against the island being involved in a war. When Davis was appointed Governor in 1746, he built and resided at ‚ÄòLe R√©duit‚Äô and deserted the residence at Mon Plaisir, so that from 1746 until 1753, Mon Plaisir was virtually abandoned. Later, Jean Baptiste Christophore Fus√©e Aublet, a horticulturist, was sent to establish a drug house and to create a botanical garden; he lived first at Mon Plaisir but was unhappy and transferred all his plant collections to R√©duit. He was at loggerheads with ‚ÄòM. Le Poivre p‚Äô (‚ÄòMister Pepper‚Äô) ‚Äî as he used to call Pierre Poivre ‚Äî over the identification of nutmeg plants (Myristica fragrans). After two visits to the Isle de France, Pierre Poivre was appointed Intendant of the island in 1767. The following year, he occupied Mon Plaisir in his official capacity and in 1770 he purchased the estate for himself. He was the creator of the present gardens, since in addition to a nursery for the acclimatisation of the nutmeg and clove plants, he also gathered together numerous plants from other areas with as many indigenous plant species as he could. It is thanks to Poivre and his successor Nicolas C√©r√©, who devoted his life and most of his personal fortune to create the gardens, that Pamplemousses became well known to leading naturalists and acquired the worldwide fame it has since retained. Between 1810 and 1849, the gardens went through an unsettled and difficult period. In 1849, James Duncan was appointed director of the much neglected gardens. He restored the abandoned gardens to something of their former beauty and introduced numerous species of plants including many of the palms now represented in the gardens. By the middle of the last century, the sugar industry had been fast developing, and the gardens provided a suitable site for the introduction of new cane varieties from other parts of the world. Dr. Charles Meller, one of the directors of the garden, was sent to Australia and New Zealand to bring new varieties of canes; unfortunately, he died in the course of the journey. When the malaria epidemic struck Mauritius in 1866, much of the gardens were used as a nursery for the production of thousands of Eucalyptus trees which were introduced in an attempt to control the disease by drying out the marshes of the country, the breeding places of mosquitoes. The Director of the Botanic Gardens became in due course also the Conservator of forests. The gardens stayed under his care until the creation of the Department of Agriculture in 1913. The latter then took over the responsibility of the gardens and they have remained under its control ever since.

The school is designated \\"good\\" by Ofsted.Ofsted: Wilmslow High School (Retrieved 30 November 2014)Ofsted report History=Grammar school Wilmslow High School began life as the co-educational Wilmslow County Grammar School in September 1960 with 900 pupils. The new county grammar school was opened by Sir James Mountford, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liverpool on 24 March 1961. A girls' grammar school was built on of the former Colshaw Hall Farm, and situated on Dean Row Road. It opened in 1965 and had 750 girls. The school on Holly Road became an all-boys' school. Comprehensive Wilmslow Boys' Grammar School (Holly Road) became Harefield County High School when it became a sixth form-entry comprehensive in 1978, gradually becoming more comprehensive. Wilmslow Girls' Grammar School (Dean Row Road) became Dean Row County High School. In the mid-1980s it became Wilmslow County High School, then Wilmslow High School in 1991.Schools in Wilmslow: Recent Schools (Retrieved 20 November 2014) The school was designated a Specialist Sports College in September 2003 (and subsequently re-designated in 2008), but the specialist schools programme ended in 2010; therefore the school is no longer a Specialist Sports College, despite still being advertised as such. Other former schools in Wilmslow included Wilmslow County Secondary School for Girls on Wycliffe Avenue in Wilmslow. When the Wycliffe Avenue Secondary Modern School closed the girls moved to Thorngrove County High School, which was until that point the Hough Secondary Modern School for Boys, having previously opened in 1965 on Thorngrove Road ‚Äì the land now occupied by the A34 bypass. Later, all schools closed, leaving Wilmslow with one high school on the site of the original boys' grammar school. Extracurricular activities The school operates the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme, and a bi-annual \\"World Challenge\\" expedition is available to older students, which for the last three years has been run through Camps International. Competitive sport is a feature of the school's extracurricular programme \\"Sports Xtra\\". In 2016, School Sport Magazine ranked the school 6th best sporting state school in the country. Academic performance The school is currently designated \\"good\\" by Ofsted, who reviewed the school in 2013; this is a drop from their previous position of \\"outstanding\\" in 2011. As of 2016, 75% of students achieve a C or better in both English and maths (compared to a national average of 59.3%), and the average A level grade attained by students is a C (equal to the national average). Although the school is below national average according to the government's \\"Progress 8\\" metric, they have an \\"Attainment 8\\" score above national average. This means that while its students make less progress than the national average, due to starting at a higher level they still achieve better than average results. Learning support The school's Learning Support provision includes an 8-place unit for children who have impaired hearing.

It is a National Natural Landmark. The cave is located from downtown San Antonio, and 10 miles northeast of Boerne off FM 474 and Kreutzberg Road. It has been commercially operated as a show cave and open for public tours since 1939. It is a member of the National Cave Association. History Although the cave has been open to the environment for many tens of thousands of years, as evidenced by numerous prehistoric animal finds discovered there, known human contact with the cave began only in the early 20th century, when a small farm animal became trapped in the small external opening of the cave, known as a sinkhole. The cave went largely unnoticed again until the 1920s during the era of Prohibition when a small moonshine distillery was installed in the uppermost cavern. It again fell into obscurity until three local farm children rediscovered the sinkhole in 1935. These children are believed to be the first who actually entered the main chambers of the cave. After the rediscovery, Jim Horn, the original owner of the property decided to open it as a commercial venture. The show cave received its name after its official opening in 1939, as verified by a news paper article that hangs in the Cave's gift shop, in a state-wide contest held in 1940. A young boy suggested that the cave \\"was too beautiful to have a name\\", and so he received the 250 dollar cash prize awarded. The second owner of the Cave Without A Name, Eugene Ebell, renamed the cave \\"Century Caverns\\" in the late 1950s, but after several years of grief from the locals, Mr. Ebell changed the name back to Cave Without A Name. Cave Without a Name was declared a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in February 2009. Description Built in 1939, the stairwell into the cave has 126 steps descending to approximately 90 feet below the surface. The cave maintains a constant temperature of 66 degrees all year round. Within the cave there are two main areas. The main set of chambers open to the public make up the show cave, extending just over a quarter of a mile. This part of the cave consists of 6 large, well-lit rooms full of speleothems including stalactites, stalagmites, helictites, columns, and draperies. The second main area of the cave is an extensive set of caverns linked to the underground extension of the Guadalupe River. During a 1975 expedition of the Cave Without A Name, cavers mapped out over 2.7 miles of caverns, making it the 7th longest cave in Texas. The cave is currently being remapped by a team of researchers from Texas State University. Due to the great natural acoustics created by 3 large solution domes on the ceiling of the large Queen's Throne room, the cave is host to 8-12 concerts each year, with attendances of up to 200 people. Some of the more common types of concerts consist of vocals, native American flute music, and Tibetan singing bowls. Some other unique features of the cave include the set of rimstone dams beneath the natural spring-fed pool, the draperies referred to by the cave's tour guides as \\"Texas-sized cave bacon\\", and a collection of stalagmites that resemble the nativity scene. In the winter months, the cave becomes home for between 5-10 dozen eastern pipistrelle bats. The seasonal inhabitants do not interfere with the tours as they only use the cave for hibernation. Another resident of the cave is a rare blind Texas salamander known as the Kendall County salamander that may only be found in the Cave Without A Name and another area cave, Cascade Caverns. In addition to tours of the Cave Without A Name, , guests to the 187 acre property have access to over a mile of hiking trails, a scavenger hunt, gem panning, geocaches, picnic tables, camp grounds, and a sculpture garden. Some activities are at an additional fee. The gift shop has a large selection of rocks, stones and fossils for sale, including numerous Amethyst cathedrals, jewelry, and more. There is also a large selection of geodes, both cut and uncut as well as a geode cutter onsite. Accident On April 30, 2007, Thomas Summers III died in a nearby, connected cave known as Dead Man's Cave. Thomas Summers was the manager of Cave Without a Name and the son of the third and current owner of the cave, Thomas Summers, II. He and another park employee Brent Holbert had gone into Dead Man's Cave to investigate why water from recent rains was not draining from Cave Without a Name. They swam into Dead Man's Cave where at times there was only two inches of breathing room. The two separated when Holbert decided not to go any further because of the danger and told Summers \\"let's get the hell out of here\\". Summers chose to go a few yards further and shortly thereafter Holbert reported hearing sounds of distress and after receiving no response from several shouts he exited the cave to call for help. Thomas Summers' body was recovered by cavers experienced in cave diving a few hours later. This is the 2nd documented death within the Cavern system.

The group reportedly made millions each season. According to figures compiled at the time by Michael Kent, the Computer Group in 1983-84 earned almost $5 million from wagers on college and, occasionally, NFL games. Yet Michael Kent suspects that his records are incomplete. They do not account for personal bets made by Dr. Mindlin, or Billy Walters and Glen Walker or by the dozens of other associates who had access to the Computer Group's information. By the time everyone had exhausted Kent's forecasts in the 1983-84 sports year, they might easily have earned $10 million, perhaps $15 million. Perhaps more. Kent invented the statistical models. He was 34 when he had created the first successful program for handicapping basketball and football games: together with his brother, Michael collected statistical data about every team to put all that info to his computer and update the program. The story was first reported by a national publication in the March 1986 Sports Illustrated.

The SSB is a member of the Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart (VVS), and operates the Stuttgart Stadtbahn, bus lines, a rack railway, and a funicular railway.  Colour Since the coat of arms of Stuttgart shows a black, rampant horse on a yellow or golden field, the Stuttgart Stadtbahn as well as all the buses come in yellow with black window frames. Stuttgart Stadtbahn The Stadtbahn, a (light rail system), covers 17 lines. The system is operated with 164 cars, operates on standard gauge track, and is electrified at 750 volts DC. Tram system used until December 2007 The last remaining tram line (15) ceased to operate on December, 8th, 2007 and was replaced by the Stadtbahn line U15 on the same day. The old tram system was operated by 38 cars of type GT4. Unlike the city's light rail system, the tram system operated on track. The conversion of tram lines to light rail lines was thus a complex procedure, and necessitates dual gauge track where both systems operated over the same track. There are also two heritage tram lines, which are operated on the second Sunday of each month and on the last Saturday of each month by the Stuttgarter Historische Stra√üenbahnen society with trams from the Tram Museum of Stuttgart. stuttgart gt4.jpgTram line 15 in the Hau√ümannstra√üe.

A Stuttgart low floor articulated bus The rack railway The funicular railway Bus system The bus network of the SSB covers Stuttgart and many neighbouring cities, with 54 different routes. Bus routes are operated by both SSB itself, and by other operators under contract to SSB. SSB's own bus fleet consists of approximately 250 vehicles, of which about 160 are articulated buses. The buses are predominantly of Mercedes Benz manufacture, although there are 36 made by MAN in the years 2001 and 2002. The bus fleet is operated from depots and yards at Gaisburg, M√∂hringen, Sielmingen, and Zuffenhausen. Other modes Besides the light rail and bus networks, the SSB operates two more unusual forms of transport: *The Stuttgart Rack Railway connects the urban districts of Stuttgart South (Marienplatz) and Degerloch (Albplatz). This line operates as SSB route 10, and connects light rail lines U1 and U14 at Marienplatz with lines U5, U6 and U8 at Albplatz. *The Standseilbahn Stuttgart, a funicular railway, links S√ºdheimer Platz with the Degerloch forest cemetery. This line, which operates as SSB route 20, connects with light rail lines U1 and U14 at S√ºdheimer Platz.  Fares and ticketing  The SSB is part of the regional transport cooperative, the Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart (VVS), which coordinates tickets and fares among all transport operators in the metropolitan area. Besides the SSB's Stadtbahn, tram and bus networks, this coordination includes the Stuttgart S-Bahn, operated by a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn AG (DBAG), and DBAG's RegionalBahn regional train services within the VVS area.

Life Glava≈° was born in 1763 in the village of Glibovac, near Smederevska Palanka, at the time part of the Sanjak of Smederevo, Ottoman Empire. In his youth, he was a gentleman's tailor in Smederevska Palanka. He never married, which was unusual for small town business owners of the time in Serbia. For a time, he shared a house with a certain other confirmed bachelor, originally from Negotin, one Borisav Petroviƒá, and they had a joint enterprise for constructing adobe houses. During this time Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá spent several months in Glava≈°'s house, either as an apprentice or as a hajduk in hiding during wintertime.According to an eponymous book about Stanoje Glava≈° by Miladin Stevanoviƒá, Knjiga-komerc Publishing, Belgrade, 2005; . Later, Glava≈° was the co-leader, with Stanko Aramba≈°iƒá (link to Serbian Wiki) and Lazar Dobriƒá (also), of a hajduk company based in Austrian-held Syrmia, which frequently crossed the Ottoman border, and attacked Ottoman forces and caravans in the Sanjak of Smederevo in the 1790s (including Koƒça's frontier rebellion). In 1804, at the eve of the First Serbian Uprising, Glava≈°, Karaƒëorƒëe and several other leaders gathered at Ora≈°ac to organize the revolt (see Serbian Revolution). Glava≈° was suggested as leader. He refused the offer, opting for Karaƒëorƒëe instead. In December 1806, commanders Vujica, Mladen Milovanoviƒá and Glava≈° commanded an army of 18,000 soldiers to defend the Serbs at the Battle of Deligrad. The fight ended in Serbian victory, with Ibrahim Bushati, pasha of Shkod√´r, signing a 6-week truce. He led a company of around 3,000 men which liberated Prokuplje and Kur≈°umlija. His company guarded the Morava Valley and fought the Ottomans in the mountains of Ni≈° and Novi Pazar for two months before being captured. He was killed by the Ottomans on 15 February 1815, after the demise of Had≈æi-Prodan's Uprising. His severed head was on display at the Kalemegdan along with other Serbian leaders. Legacy In his home town, there is a street and an elementary school named after him. He is the subject of a Serbian heroic play written by ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá, which was widely shown throughout Serbia in the 19th century. As a young widow, his mother remarried when he was about 12 or 13 (and that's when he became a tailor's apprentice) so he had several half-siblings, many years younger to whom he played a kind of fatherly role in his mature age, especially as he did not have his own family. He also had full (i.e. not half-) brother and sister from his mother's first marriage (to his father) and as a leader of the Serbian Revolution, he facilitated the marriage of his niece Marija (daughter of his brother) to Hajduk Veljko Petroviƒá, a fellow- hero and leader of the revolution (and there are surviving descendants of that union).Translated from Serbian Wikipedia See also * List of Serbian Revolutionaries References 1763 births 1815 deaths People from Smederevska Palanka Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Serbian revolutionaries Hajduks People of the First Serbian Uprising 19th-century Serbian people Assassinated Serbian people Burials at Serbian Orthodox monasteries and churches Trophy heads Rebels of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Stanoje Glava≈°"},{"id":"9609438","text":"Sir Anthony Aucher, 1st Baronet (1614 ‚Äì 31 May 1692) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1660.

Most of her 11 film credits are silent movie features. Early life Coleman was born in Mason, Ohio (just north of Cincinnati, Ohio) to Pierce (\\"Percy\\") Coleman and Grace (nee Slayback) Coleman. Her father was a former Major League Baseball pitcher from Mason. The name \\"Majel\\" means \\"wood dove\\". Sometime prior to age 17, Majel and her parents were living in Cincinnati, where she attended Hughes Center High School (which is adjacent to the University of Cincinnati campus). Model and film actress Majel, who was a beauty contest winner in her hometown, went to Hollywood in 1921 after high school. A February 1922 newspaper article stated that she had been disqualified from an amateur beauty contest because her photos were shot by a professional photographer. However, \\"her beauty attracted the attention of a big middle-western theater owner, who sent her photos on to a representative of a Pacific coast studio, with the result that she has already appeared in five feature productions and is now a permanent resident at the capital of the cinema world.\\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/298938551/?terms=%22majel%2Bcoleman%22 A month earlier a newspaper reported that \\"Max Linder is working on a burlesque of 'The Three Musketeteers', a five-reel Goldwyn comedy nearing completion.

Miss Coleman is now appearing in King Baggott's 'Kisses' at Universal.\\"https://www.newspapers.com/image/96394311/?terms=%22majel%2Bcoleman%22 Coleman wanted to work for Cecil B. De Mille in particular. When she could not find a way to get his attention, she lost interest in working for other movie studios. Then a chance happening changed Coleman's future. De Mille noticed Coleman when a small stray dog followed her home and became intimidated by her police dog. The little dog jumped off her porch and broke its leg on the cement below. It continued on across the street with Coleman pursuing. A car driven by the film producer almost ran over the red haired beauty. Together Demille and Coleman took the puppy to the hospital. De Mille then signed Coleman to a movie contract in March 1925. He made tests and arranged for her to act in small parts in his next films. Coleman's hands became an ideal of perfection, beginning with film screen tests which revealed their beauty, and she was often a hand double in movies. She was listed among the 14 most beautiful women in the world in 1926 along with Sally Rand, Etta Lee, Eugenia Gilbert, Jocelyn Lee, Sally Long, Clara Morris, Olive Borden, Christina Montt, Adalyn Mayer, Thais Valdemar, Yola D'Avril, and Dorothy Seastrom. Her early motion picture efforts include roles in Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1923) and several Harry Carey westerns, Soft Shoes (1925) and West of Broadway (1926). In Corporal Kate (1926) Coleman stars with Vera Reynolds and Julia Faye. The setting is Rivecourt, France, a town almost totally destroyed by the German offensive of August‚ÄìSeptember 1918, during World War I. The American 7th Machine Gun Battalion fought there. In 1927, Coleman played Procula, the wife of Pontius Pilate, in Demille's production of King of Kings. Her last films include roles in The Girl In The Glass Cage (1929) and Romance of the Rio Grande (1929).

According to Evan McKenzie, they are dominated by lawyers and property managers that have shaped legislative and judicial policy making to prevent meaningful regulation of CID activity,McKenzie, Privatopia, 27. and to keep the discourse on such matters largely private.Privatopia, 26. In the absence of legislative regulation or oversight perceived as meaningful to their objectives, the idea of residential private government took the shape advocated originally by developers through the Urban Land Institute and the Federal Housing Administration, and later, by lawyers and property managers, through CAI.Privatopia, 121. Over the decades, CAI has worked to address concerns raised about the development industry by critics, such as, about professor McKenzie.

Precipitin reaction The precipitin reaction provided the first quantitative assay for antibody.

To produce a precipitin reaction, varying amounts of soluble antigen are added to a fixed amount of serum containing antibody. As the amount of antigen added: * In the zone of antibody excess, each molecule of antigen is bound extensively by antibody and crosslinked to other molecules of antigen. The average size of antibody-antigen complex is small; cross- linking between antigen molecules by antibody is rare. * In the zone of equivalence, the formation of precipitin complexes is optimal. Extensive lattices of antigen and antibody are formed by cross-linking. * At high concentrations of antigen, the average size of antibody-antigen complexes is once again small because few antibody molecules are available to cross-link antigen molecules together. The small, soluble immune complexes formed in vivo in the zone of antigen excess can cause a variety of pathological syndromes.

Rising along the border between Tennessee and North Carolina, the mountain dominates the Western Smokies. The Appalachian Trail crosses its summit, making it a popular hiking destination. Rocky Top, a knob on the western part of the mountain's summit ridge, shares its name with a popular Tennessee state song. Thunderhead rises approximately above its northern base at Little River and approximately above its southern base at Bone Valley. The mountain consists of three peaks, the lowest being Rocky Top at above sea level and the easternmost being the highest at above sea level. Thunderhead is the highest point in Blount County, Tennessee and the highest point on the Appalachian Trail coming from the south until the trail ascends Silers Bald some to the east. The mountain's name originated in the 19th century. It probably referred to the unpredictable weather that often strikes the higher elevations in the Smokies. According to Laura Thornborough, a writer who hiked to the summit of Thunderhead along with local guide Sam Cook in the 1930s:  Geology  Thunderhead consists of precambrian sandstone. Thunderhead sandstone is part of the Ocoee Supergroup, which was formed from ancient ocean sediments between 500 million and one billion years ago. The mountain itself was formed appx. 200 million years ago during the Appalachian orogeny, when the collision of the North American and African plates thrust the rock upward.Moore, Harry. 1988 pp. 26-27.  History  Rocky Top, with its characteristic sandstone boulders. James Spence, who cleared the ridge to the west (now known as Spence Field), was the first known permanent settler in the vicinity. While the extent of Spence's farm is unknown, cattle-grazing had rendered Thunderhead a grassy bald by the late-19th century. The view from Rocky Top, looking northwest. Thunderhead is one of the few mountains listed under its current name in Arnold Guyot's 1859 survey of the crest of the Smokies. Guyot measured Thunderhead's elevation at above sea level, missing the modern measurement by just seven feet (2 m). During the Civil War, a group of East Tennesseans attempted to form a wilderness settlement on the mountain's north slope known as \\"New World,\\" although the settlement didn't last. The settlement was located along Thunderhead Prong, near Chimney Rocks. As preservationist groups began buying land in the Smokies in the early 1900s, Thunderhead became a favorite hiking destination for park visitors. John W. Oliver, the great-grandson of the first European settlers in Cades Cove, started offering guided hikes to the mountain in 1924. The trail he (and Thornborough's guide, Sam Cook) used largely followed the Bote Mountain Trail-Appalachian Trail route still in use today.Dunn, Durwood. 1988 p. 243. In the years after the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was formed, wooded plants started to reclaim much of the Smokies crest west of Clingmans Dome. Park strategy at present is to allow Thunderhead to return to its natural state. A narrow path is maintained across the top of the mountain for Appalachian Trail thru-hikers.  Access  The Appalachian Trail approaching the summit of Thunderhead Mountain. The Bote Mountain Trail, with its trailhead on Little River Road, ascends to the crest of the Smokies and intersects the Appalachian Trail at Spence Field. From Spence Field, it is approximately to the summit of Thunderhead. The Lead Cove Trail, also beginning on Little River Road (near Cades Cove), offers the shortest access to the summit by bypassing the first of the Bote Mountain Trail. From the Lead Cove trailhead, it is approximately to the summit of Thunderhead. The Anthony Creek Trail, rising out of the Cades Cove campground, also bypasses the first of the Bote Mountain Trail. From the Anthony Creek trailhead, it is approximately to the summit of Thunderhead. While the main summit of Thunderhead is covered in foliage, Rocky Top offers a 360-degree view of the western Smokies.

Nicosia Atat√ºrk Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in North Nicosia, Northern Cyprus. It is the largest stadium in Northern Cyprus. It is currently used mostly for football matches and hosted some matches for the 2006 ELF Cup. It also serves as the home of √áetinkaya and Yenicami of the KTFF S√ºper Lig and Gen√ßlik G√ºc√º of the KTFF Birinci Lig. The stadium holds 15,000 people, and has a tartan track that is used for athletics competitions and for walking by the locals. The stadium also hosts celebrations in national holidays, and dance shows, attended by thousands. The plans to build a stadium with a capacity of 20,000 in northern Nicosia were announced on 20 November 1975, when a sign was placed on the fields that would be the site of the stadium. The stadium was opened on 28 January 1990, with a match between Fenerbah√ße and Sarƒ±yer, which was won 1-0 by Sarƒ±yer. The inauguration was attended by 25,000 people, a record for Northern Cyprus, as well as Prime Minister Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu, Minister of Sports G√ºnay Caymaz, and Turkish ministers Mehmet Yazar and ƒ∞smet √ñzarslan. Be≈üikta≈ü, Galatasaray and Trabzonspor were also invited. The stadium was later used by Turkish teams for friendly matches in 1990s, including a match between Be≈üikta≈ü and Sarƒ±yer on 12 January 1991. In 2010, the Turkish Cypriot Ministry of National Education, Youth and Sports transferred the ownership of the stadium to the Nicosia Turkish Municipality. It was renovated in 2011, with its grass being renewed and new electronic scoreboards installed. A shooting polygon was also unveiled in the stadium in 2014. As the first multi-purpose stadium in Northern Cyprus, the construction of the stadium resolved the lack of an appropriate track for the training of Turkish Cypriot athletes. In work that started on 22 September 2004, the athletics track of the stadium was reconstructed as a Tartan track. The stadium is considered to be the most prestigious in Northern Cyprus. It has a caf√©, numerous broadcast rooms, a conference hall and a press conference hall.

Geography Luzech is a small town of around 1,650 inhabitants, located in the Quercy at the heart of the vineyard of Cahors wine making region (AOC) on the ancient line Monsempron ‚Äì Libos ‚Äì Cahors between Fumel and Cahors. Encircled by the Lot River, Luzech is a peninsula, an inescapable stage on the circuit \\"Empowered by the Lot\\". A dam, the Barrage de Luzech was constructed in the late 1940s. Animated by very active associations, the town offers many socio-cultural and sporting activities, such as orienteering, fishing and kayaking. Luzech is situated on an isthmus formed by the Lot, 90 m wide (or 300 Roman feet), bordered to the north by the hill of the Impernal (150 m) to the south by that of the Pistoule ( 70 m) that the river bypasses a loop, called \\"cingle\\" (meander). The central square (main street) is built on the site of an old canal, created for navigation in 1840, and filled in between 1940 and 1950. It shortened the navigation on the Lot by around 5 km. As part of the navigation project of the Lot as far as Aiguillon, Luzech is currently at an impassable barrier and many projects are underway to advance it. Place Names The place name Luzech could be based on Gallic names such as Lucetios, Luteus or Lutos followed by -ecia 1. History Luzech was already inhabited in prehistoric times, including the Pech de la N√®ne. Before the Roman conquest, the Gauls built an oppidum on the Impernal, naturally fortified by its rugged character. Luzech was among the places in the Lot considered to possibly be the famous fortified camp of Uxellodunum. The hypothesis was defended once upon a time by Napoleon III, who finally determined the location of Puy Issolud was still defended, with some notoriety by a local scholar, Emile Albouy in 1957. However, recent excavations of the Fountain Louli√© in Puy Issolud led to a scientific consensus on the issue, even if individuals still defended sites other than that of Puy d‚ÄôIssolud. For this reason the visitors will use Uxellodunum street to go to the administration building and will park in the Square of Lucterius who was the heroic leader of this resistance, and whose majestic bust is located at the entrance to the Cahors library. In the Middle Ages, the walls hemmed the town in on all sides. They were built at the foot of the castle, the oldest mention of which goes back to the same century. Several gates gave access to the town, crossed from north to south by the Main street from the Ruffier gate to the Ditch gate. Luzech was home to one of the four baronies of Quercy. It was called the town of the barons to mark the importance of the family of De Luzech, who preserved it from the eleventh century to the early seventeenth century when it then passed onto the house of Rastignac who occupied it up the Revolution. Taken by Richard the Lion Heart in 1188, Luzech later fell into the hands of Albigensians, but during the crusade of the early thirteenth century, the fortress was taken and burned by the Crusaders of Simon de Montfort. It was acquired later by Guillaume de Cardaillac, Bishop of Cahors, who became lord of Luzech. The barons became co- lords. The Hundred Years' War caused havoc: most castles fell to the English, but they never considered implementing their plan to besiege Luzech. Excavations on the hill of the Impernal helped expose remains of walls and buildings of Gallic and Roman times. The Chapt de Rastignac family from Limousin, inherited in Quercy, property of the barons of Luzech in 1600, thanks to the marriage of Jacquette Ricard Gourdon, widow of John II of Luzech, with Jean Chapt Rastignac. This one, attached to the service of Louis XIII and then Louis XIV, avoided the village of Luzech and the uncertainties of the Fronde. In 1617, the estate of Rastignac was elevated to the status of the marquisat, and John became a brigadier. In a letter addressed to him, Louis XIII wrote: \\"(...) I have you always under the consideration that you deserve. I pray God, Count, to have you in His Holy Guard\\" They possessed Luzech until the mid-eighteenth century. Their descendant, Alfred de la Rochefoucauld, whose mother was born Z√©na√Øde Rastignac, wil sell all the family property, and yield to the town all that was left of the castle of the Barons.

Education =The Future Scholary City  In 2014, the site of the Scholary City was begun. This will bring together the nursery, primary and secondary schools. Funding is provided by the Department of the Lot, and by the town of Luzech for a total amount of ‚Ç¨16.4 million, including ‚Ç¨12 million for the College. The first stone was laid on 19 December 2014 by Serge Rigal (Chairman of the Department), G√©rard Alazard (Mayor of Luzech) and three children: one for kindergarten, one for primary and one for college.‚Üë ¬´ Le chantier de la Cit√© scolaire de Luzech en images ¬ª [archive], sur http://lot.fr [archive], 31 octobre 2014 (consult√© le 1er f√©vrier 2015) The school will accommodate 450 students with the possibility of extending it to 500, a primary school size 150 and kindergarten size 90 on 6000 m2. Thirty companies of which a third are from the department of the Lot, are providing the construction. This new establishment will open in 2016.  The Impernal College  The college of the Imperial of Luzech is located on the left bank of Lot, 150 meters south of the east-west route D8. For the 2014-2015 school year, 292 students were enrolled and divided into twelve classes, on four levels, from sixth to third. 51 students are part of the rugby Sports Section.  Primary school  The public primary school has 69 students divided into 3 classes of 16 students each.  Nursery school  The public kindergarten hosted 71 children, divided into three classes, in 2012. Sport The rugby club XV, the Sports Union of Luzech, evolved into the Championship of France, 3rd Federal division, for the 2010-2011 season. It was relegated for the 2011-2012 season.

The species is endemic to the central United States. Etymology The specific name, grahamii, is in honor of Lt. Col. James Duncan Graham, U.S. Topographical Engineers, who collected the type specimen.Beltz, Ellin (2006).

Common names Additional common names for R. grahamii include Arkansas water snake, Graham's leather snake, Graham's queen snake, Graham's snake, Graham's water snake, prairie water adder, prairie water snake, and striped moccasin. Description R. grahamii is a medium-sized snake, measuring an average of 18‚Äì28 inches (46‚Äì71 cm) in total length (including tail), but can grow up to almost 4 feet long in some cases. The maximum recorded total length is 47 inches (119 cm).Conant, Roger (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston, Massachusetts: Houghton Mifflin Company. xviii + 429 pp. (hardcover), (paperback).(GRAHAM'S WATER SNAKE Natrix grahami, p. 150 + Plate 21 + Map 110). It is usually a brown or gray color with an occasional faint mid-dorsal stripe. Its lateral stripes are typically cream, white tan, or light yellow and located from the belly up to the fourth scale row. The belly is typically the same color as the lateral stripes and is unmarked, with the exception of a row of dark dots down the center (rare in specimens). Subspecies There are no subspecies of Graham's crayfish snake, Regina grahamii, which are recognized. Habitat Regina grahamii occurs along the margins of mud-bottom marshes, oxbow lakes, rivers and streams. It particularly likes roadside ditches abundant with crayfish. Graham's crayfish snake typically hides under rocks, logs, and other debris at the waters edge and also spend much time in crayfish burrows. Diet Graham's crayfish snake feeds chiefly upon crayfish, especially recently molted crayfish. It is also reported to eat fish and amphibians. Temperament and defense The primary defenses for this species, Regina grahamii, are camouflage and nocturnal behavior. When alarmed, especially while basking, it will make a quick escape into the water and hide. This species is relatively docile, but it may flatten out and musk if captured. Reproduction Adult females of R. grahamii bear live young in broods of 10‚Äì15. Each newborn is about 8 inches (about 20 cm) in total length (including tail).Schmidt, Karl P., and D.

In captivity R. grahamii is difficult to keep in captivity, usually refusing all food and developing skin lesions easily. Only experienced snake owners should attempt to raise this species.

Population: The district is delimited by Nakhimovsky Avenue (north), Obrucheva Street (south), Sevastopolsky Avenue (east), Profsoyuznaya Street, and Vlasova Street (west). The district is mostly residential, with an industrial area near Kaluzhskaya metro station. It houses the Gazprom headquarters. History In 1956, the northern side of the district became a site of a massive, cheap housing construction and a microdistrict was built there. Cheryomushki became a common word for such housing projects. The Soviet-era buildings in this area were torn down in the 1990s-2000s and replaced with high-rises, also of standardized prefabricated concrete. Following the death of leader Leonid Brezhnev, the district was renamed Brezhnevsky District () in his honour. In 1989 the name was changed back to Cheryomushki. In the early 1980s, the government built a number of better quality, brickwork apartment buildings that acquired a reputation of, by local standards, elite housing, and called Tsarskoye Selo (, Royal village). In the 1990s, it served as a nucleus of a massive new housing construction project between Garibaldi Street and Gazprom tower. Politics The head of the local government, Sergey Burkotov, was shot dead in February 2007, in what appears to have been an assassination. Public transportation The western side of the district is accessible by the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line of the Moscow Metro (stations Profsoyuznaya to Kaluzhskaya). The eastern side is also accessible through the Serpukhovsko- Timiryazevskaya Line (Sevastopolskaya, Nakhimovsky Prospekt).

In the operetta, the cheap housing in the district is portrayed ironically as a 'dream come true' for Muscovites who had lost their houses in other, more traditional, parts of Moscow. The operetta satirizes the corruption and bureaucracy of the Soviet state through hilariously observed caricatures. Cheryomushki is also prominently mentioned in the popular film The Irony of Fate, which is traditionally shown on New Year's Eve in Russia and other states of the former USSR. The key subplot of the film is the drab uniformity of Brezhnev era public architecture.

The definition used in measure theory is closely related to, but not identical to, the definition typically used in probability. Measure-theoretic definition Textbooks on real analysis and measure theory often use the following definition. Let (X,\\\\mathfrak{M}, \\\\mu) be a positive measure space. A set \\\\Phi\\\\subset L^1(\\\\mu) is called uniformly integrable if to each \\\\varepsilon>0 there corresponds a \\\\delta>0 such that : \\\\int_E f \\\\, d\\\\mu < \\\\varepsilon whenever f \\\\in \\\\Phi and \\\\mu(E)<\\\\delta. Probability definition In the theory of probability, the following definition applies. * A class \\\\mathcal{C} of random variables is called uniformly integrable (UI) if given \\\\varepsilon>0, there exists K\\\\in[0,\\\\infty) such that \\\\operatorname E(XI_{X\\\\geq K})\\\\le\\\\varepsilon\\\\ \\\\text{ for all X} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C}, where I_{X\\\\geq K} is the indicator function I_{X\\\\geq K} = \\\\begin{cases} 1 &\\\\text{if } X\\\\geq K, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\text{if } X < K. \\\\end{cases} * An alternative definition involving two clauses may be presented as follows: A class \\\\mathcal{C} of random variables is called uniformly integrable if: ** There exists a finite M such that, for every X in \\\\mathcal{C}, \\\\operatorname E(X)\\\\leq M and ** For every \\\\varepsilon > 0 there exists \\\\delta > 0 such that, for every measurable A such that P(A)\\\\leq \\\\delta and every X in \\\\mathcal{C}, \\\\operatorname E(XI_A)\\\\leq\\\\varepsilon. The two probabilistic definitions are equivalent. Relationship between definitions The two definitions are closely related. A probability space is a measure space with total measure 1. A random variable is a real-valued measurable function on this space, and the expectation of a random variable is defined as the integral of this function with respect to the probability measure. Specifically, Let (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, P) be a probability space. Let the random variable X be a real-valued \\\\mathcal{F}-measurable function. Then the expectation of X is defined by ::\\\\operatorname E(X) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega X \\\\, dP provided that the integral exists. Then the alternative probabilistic definition above can be rewritten in measure theoretic terms as: A set \\\\mathcal{C} of real-valued functions is called uniformly integrable if: * There exists a finite M such that, for every X in \\\\mathcal{C}, \\\\int_\\\\Omega X \\\\, dP \\\\leq M. * For every \\\\varepsilon > 0 there exists \\\\delta > 0 such that, for every measurable A such that P(A)\\\\leq \\\\delta and for every X in \\\\mathcal{C}, \\\\int_A X \\\\, dP \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon. Comparison of this definition with the measure theoretic definition given above shows that the measure theoretic definition requires only that each function be in L^1(\\\\mu). In other words, \\\\int_X f \\\\, d\\\\mu is finite for each f, but there is not necessarily an upper bound to the values of these integrals. In contrast, the probabilistic definition requires that the integrals have an upper bound. One consequence of this is that uniformly integrable random variables (under the probabilistic definition) are tight. That is, for each \\\\varepsilon > 0, there exists a > 0 such that :: \\\\int_{X > a} dP < \\\\varepsilon for all X. In contrast, uniformly integrable functions (under the measure theoretic definition) are not necessarily tight. In his book, Bass uses the term uniformly absolutely continuous to refer to sets of random variables (or functions) which satisfy the second clause of the alternative definition. However, this definition does not require each of the functions to have a finite integral. The term \\"uniform absolute continuity\\" is not standard, but is used by some other authors. Related corollaries The following results apply to the probabilistic definition. * Definition 1 could be rewritten by taking the limits as :: \\\\lim_{K \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sup_{X \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C}} \\\\operatorname E(X\\\\,I_{X\\\\geq K})=0. * A non-UI sequence. Let \\\\Omega = [0,1] \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}, and define ::X_n(\\\\omega) = \\\\begin{cases} n, & \\\\omega\\\\in (0,1/n), \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 , & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} :Clearly X_n\\\\in L^1, and indeed \\\\operatorname E(X_n)=1\\\\ , for all n. However, ::\\\\operatorname E(X_n,X_n\\\\ge K)= 1\\\\ \\\\text{ for all } n\\\\ge K, :and comparing with definition 1, it is seen that the sequence is not uniformly integrable. Non-UI sequence of RVs. The area under the strip is always equal to 1, but X_n \\\\to 0 pointwise. * By using Definition 2 in the above example, it can be seen that the first clause is satisfied as L^1 norm of all X_ns are 1 i.e., bounded. But the second clause does not hold as given any \\\\delta positive, there is an interval (0, 1/n) with measure less than \\\\delta and E[X_m: (0, 1/n)] =1 for all m \\\\ge n . * If X is a UI random variable, by splitting ::\\\\operatorname E(X) = \\\\operatorname E(X,X>K)+\\\\operatorname E(X,X :and bounding each of the two, it can be seen that a uniformly integrable random variable is always bounded in L^1. * If any sequence of random variables X_n is dominated by an integrable, non- negative Y: that is, for all œâ and n, ::\\\\ X_n(\\\\omega) \\\\le Y(\\\\omega),\\\\ Y(\\\\omega)\\\\ge 0,\\\\ \\\\operatorname E(Y)< \\\\infty, :then the class \\\\mathcal{C} of random variables \\\\\\\\{X_n\\\\\\\\} is uniformly integrable. * A class of random variables bounded in L^p (p>1) is uniformly integrable.

Before being called to the House of Lords, he was a Tory Member of Parliament from 1817 through 1821. Background Cholmondeley was a direct descendant of Sir Robert Walpole, the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. He was the eldest son of George James Cholmondeley, who had been created the first Marquess of Cholmondeley in 1815. His mother was the former Lady Georgiana Charlotte Bertie, second daughter and coheir of Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven.Lodge, Edmund. (1877). The Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire as at Present Existing, p. 125. Lord George was educated at Eton, leaving in 1805. He participated in the coronation of King George IV in 1821, as one of eight eldest sons of peers holding the king's train. The others were the Earl of Surrey, Marquess of Douro, Viscount Cranborne, Earl of Brecknock, Earl of Uxbridge, Earl of Rawdon, Viscount Ingestre and Lord Francis Conyngham. Personal life thumbFuneral hatchment, St Martin's Church, Houghton, showing Cholmondeley impaling Somerset, for his second wife After a brief interest in Catholicism, Cholmondeley became a devout Methodist. Cholmondeley married Caroline Campbell, second daughter of Sir Colin Campbell, on 20 October 1812, in Gibraltar. She died on 12 October 1815. On 11 May 1830, he married Lady Susan Caroline Somerset, fourth daughter of Henry Charles Somerset, 6th Duke of Beaufort. Both of his marriages were childless. The Dowager Marchioness Susan survived her husband by 16 years; she died in 1886. Career In 1817, Cholmondeley was elected to the House of Commons for Castle Rising, a seat he held until 1821, when he was called to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Newburgh. George's father stipulated that his eldest son replace him as a condition of his own resignation, to accommodate Henry Conyngham, 1st Marquess Conyngham, whose wife, Elizabeth, was the mistress of King George. Cholmondeley's younger brother, William Henry, was reportedly his father's favourite, and it was said that their father wanted his elder son out of the way \\"so that his second and favourite son, Lord Henry, may come into Parliament,\\" which he did in 1822. In 1830, Cholmondeley was admitted to the Privy Council. In addition, he held the office of Constable of Castle Rising between 1858 and 1870.

Pro whaling countries unsuccessfully challenged the 1982 moratorium, yet succeeded in shifting the IWC focus from whale conservation to management of commercial whaling. A full provisional meeting agenda can be seen here :Annotated Provisional Agenda (PDF) Live coverage of the Meeting is available each year here: 1st Day, 16 June 2006 Of the two votes proposed by Japan on the first day, both were defeated by narrow majorities. 30-32 in the case of removing small cetaceans from IWC competence and 30-33 on the proposal to introduce secret ballots. A number of countries, Costa Rica, Gambia, Peru, Togo and others either were not present at the vote or had not completed their registration procedures/fees payments before the votes. At least three of these countries have now arrived and/or completed their registration and are now eligible to vote, suggesting that the voting on resolutions may be much closer for the remainder of the meeting. 2nd Day, 17 June 2006 The Bowhead whale stock from which the Alaskans take their quota is now estimated to be 10,500 with a growth rate of more than 3%. Apparently a record number of calves were counted in the recent survey work. Greenland voluntarily introduced a reduction in fin whales taken following advice from the IWC Scientific committee (IWC SC) that the catch of 19 animals may not be a safe level of catch and noted that this left Greenland with a shortfall of 220 tons of whalemeat from their quota of 670 tons. They made enquiries into the stock levels of Humpback whales and Bowhead whales around Greenland with the possible intent of opening up a hunt eventually on these two species to make up the shortfall. This of course alarmed anti- whaling countries and NGO's immediately . The RMS was discussed yet again in depth to no avail, with the chairman of the IWC, Henrik Fischer, noting that RMS discussions are at an impasse and that he will close discussion on the RMS on the afternoon of 18 June if nobody comes up with any new ideas. Japan suggested a meeting to discuss the \\" normalisation\\" of the IWC, which was commented / debated upon in detail, resulting in the agreement of many countries to attend any arranged meeting with open minds. Japan proposed a schedule amendment regarding its coastal whaling communities to take a small number of Minke whales From the \\"O\\" Stock. After much discussion, the proposal was defeated with 30 votes for the proposal and 31 votes against with 4 abstentions. (As a schedule amendment, the proposal would have required a three quarters majority to pass.) 3rd Day, 18 June 2006 Discussion of the southern ocean sanctuary as well as a Caribbean sanctuary proposed by France. The vote on whether to remove the southern ocean sanctuary was defeated by 28-33 with 5 abstentions. The French delegate was verbally denounced by a number of Caribbean nations for not discussing their proposed sanctuary with any of the other Caribbean nations in advance of their proposal and the proposal was not voted upon. The St Kitts and Nevis Declaration was discussed and voted upon, and adopted with 33 votes in favour, 32 against, and one abstention, the first time in more than two decades that the Whaling Commission has expressed support for commercial whaling. The Declaration declared the moratorium on whaling \\"no longer necessary\\". Protest Dolphin activist Richard O‚ÄôBarry livened up the proceedings by walking into the Plenary session wearing a TV screen on his chest which was showing video footage of the dolphin slaughter in Taiji, Japan and other coastal cities.

Essentially all of Ward Island is now used by Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi. More correctly classed as a peninsula, Ward Island is connected to the Corpus Christi shoreline by about 1,500 ft (460 m) of wetland. It is roughly triangular in shape, some 5,000 ft (1,500 m) long across the front and 2,500 ft (760 m) average depth, giving approximately 240 acres (0.97 km¬≤) in useful size, or 259 acres (1.04 km¬≤) counting the wetland. The soil is clay, formed by erosion, contrasted to sand islands formed by deposition. Its maximum elevation is only about 15 ft (4.6 m) above the sea- level of Corpus Christi Bay. A causeway (Ocean Drive) connects the island to the Corpus Christi shore, then extends beyond the island to the opposite side of Oso Bay and the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi at Flour Bluff about 1.0 mi (1.6 km) away. History Ward Island historical marker Ward Island in 1934 Ward Island in 1971 Ward Island in 2002 Originally called \\"Island A,\\" it was later named for land developer John C. Ward, who obtained the island in 1892. His plans were to develop the habitual area into an exclusive resort community, but the plans were crushed during a depression in 1893; the island, however, still became a popular fishing and hunting site. In 1909, W. E. James and Herman Anderson purchased the land and put up a few rustic shelters as a sportsman business; this remained until the 1940s.\\"History,\\" in TAMU-CC Campus Master Plan Update 2007; http://facilities.tamucc.edu/pdf/Master/history.pdf With war looming, the United States Congress directed that the U.S. Navy develop an air training facility in the Corpus Christi Bay vicinity. A huge area of land was acquired at Flour Bluff about south of downtown Corpus Christi. Construction of Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC) started in June 1940, and the base was dedicated on 12 March 1941. A major highway was built to the east end of the base, and, for a second entrance, the existing Ocean Drive causeway that passed by Ward Island was improved.\\"Naval Air Station Corpus Christi\\", in The Handbook of Texas Online;http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qbn01 Immediately following the start of World War II, the Navy initiated a major program to train highly qualified technicians to maintain the myriad of electronic systems, particularly radar, that was urgently needed. The then-uninhabited Ward Island was selected as the site of an advanced school for airborne electronics maintenance. The selection of Ward Island was based on the requirement for isolation and high security, and, although not a part of NASCC, this base was only minutes away and able to provide many of the auxiliary needs of the school. By July 1942, the school was ready and received its first students. Soon named Naval Air Technical Training Center Ward Island, for the remainder of the war it produced, in secrecy, many thousands of Navy, Marine, Coast Guard, and Royal Air Force maintenance personnel.Martinez, Deborah; \\"Ward Island was hush-hush radar school,\\" Caller- Times, 7 March 2000; http://www.caller2.com/2000/march/07/today/local_ne/1801.html NATTC Ward Island closed in October 1947. The island almost immediately became a center of higher education. It was first the home of the University of Corpus Christi (1947‚Äì1973), and since 1993 has been the home of Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi. In the intervening years, the institutions were Texas A&I; at Corpus Christi (1973‚Äì1977) and Corpus Christi State University (1977‚Äì1993).\\"History,\\" op. cet. In addition, in 1973 a small portion of Ward Island was permanently set aside for special university-level religious training; since 2003, this area has been used by the South Texas School for Christian Studies. Naval Air Technical Training Center When World War II started with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941), the Radio Materiel School (RMS) on the campus of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington D.C. was the only Navy training source of electronic technicians. Although the RMS produced excellent technicians, the curriculum did not include radar, and airborne electronics of any type was missing. Further, the war effort would need thousands of these technicians, and the RML, even with enlarged facilities, graduated only a few hundred per year. An ad hoc committee was immediately formed to address this issue. Under the leadership of William C. Eddy, a medically retired (deafness) submarine officer, a radically new training activity, commonly called the Electronics Training Program (ETP), was devised and actually started 12 January 1942.\\"Navy Establishes New Radio School,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, 13 Jan. 1942 Electronics Training Program The ETP was initially a two-level training activity: a three-month Primary School, taught by six engineering colleges across the Nation (later three Navy- operated Primary Schools were added), and three Secondary (or Advanced) Schools. Entry into the ETP required passing the Eddy Test. A one-month Pre- Radio School was soon added; this was mainly taught in facilities of junior colleges in the Chicago area. Both the Eddy Test and the subsequent Pre-Radio School were rigorous filters, passing only a small fraction of the most capable candidates. The Primary Schools concentrated the main topics from the first two years of a traditional engineering curriculum into three months of 12-hour instructional days. The Secondary Schools, all taught by Navy and Marine instructors, were initially five months in length, then increased to six months, and eventually to seven months as additional topics were added. Two of the Secondary Schools centered on shipboard and shore-based electronics; one was a further enlargement of the RMS at the NRL, and the other a duplication of the RMS at Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay. (In 1944, another duplication was made at Navy Pier in Chicago.) The third initial Secondary School, this one centering on airborne electronics, was at NATTC Ward Island. All of the Secondary Schools operated under high security.Watson, Raymond C., Jr.; Solving the Naval Radar Crisis, Trafford Publishing, 2007 Facilities, students, and instruction Located on a causeway southeast of Corpus Christi and northeast of the recently opened Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Ward Island was an ideal location for the highly secure school. The Navy acquired Ward Island in February 1942, facility construction started in May, and the school was commissioned on July 1. Commander George K. Stoddard was the initial Commanding Officer. An Administration Building, two instructional buildings, five barracks, and two mess halls were ready, but only a part of the 240-acre (0.97-km¬≤) site had been cleared and most streets were unpaved. The unimproved back side was infested by rattlesnakes. Instructional personnel, classroom equipment, and existing students were transferred from a small, similar school that had been started by the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics a few months earlier at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. The first new class from Primary Schools was also started at this time.Stoddard, George K.; \\"Naval Air Technical Training Center, Ward Island, Corpus Christi, Texas, 1941-1944\\"; Commander's Summary Report to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Personnel, 1944; Archives of the Aviation History Branch, Naval Historical Center In September 1942, authority for the school was transferred from the Bureau of Aeronautics to the Air Training Command and it was officially designated the Naval Air Technical Training Center Ward Island (NATTC Ward Island). The first regular class of 106 students graduated in late September, and the following class of 152 students graduated in early October. Thereafter, a new class of 200 students started very two weeks. Beginning in mid-1944, a new class started every week, and the number of students peaked at about 3,100. Eventually, NATTC Ward Island had 87 buildings, including a dispensary with 34 beds, a 4,000-volume library, a 350-seat chapel, an even larger auditorium (destroyed by fire in early 1946), a well-stocked ship's store, a gymnasium, and a reception center for visitors. There were 17 barracks, several Bachelor Officer Quarters, and 6 mess halls. Outside there were a number of athletic fields and courts (the football field doubled as the parade ground), two swimming pools (every student had to pass a swimming test), and a cross-country track encircling most of the island. Originally, NATTC Ward Island was primarily intended for training enlisted U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine personnel. The Marine students, along with the Marine guards, were sufficient in number to warrant a Lieutenant Colonel as the Detachment Commander. In a short while, students from the U.S. Coast Guard and from the Royal Air Force in Great Britain were added. The British students would be instructed in separate groups, and occasionally these would have personnel from the Royal Canadian Air Force. In certain of the segments of the Secondary School, there would occasionally be Warrant and Commissioned Officers. There was an advanced radar school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that officers normally attended, but the instruction there did not include airborne systems; thus, officers needing such instruction were sometimes assigned to NATTC Ward Island. Starting in 1943, a special three- month course was given for WAVES supply officers. Throughout the existence of NATTC Ward Island, refresher courses for both officers and enlisted men were continually given. Instruction in the Secondary School was divided about equally between lecture and laboratory work. Lectures included advanced electronic circuits, microwave theory, servomechanisms and other topics that might normally be in the upper level at engineering colleges. Laboratories included aircraft communication systems, high-frequency and microwave radar systems, identification, friend or foe (IFF) systems, radar altimeters, and long-range navigation (LORAN) equipment. In addition to the regular curriculum, there were special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight and the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), both highly classified at that time, and the Navy's first drone aircraft, the Target Drone Denny 1 (TTD-1).Watson, op. cit., pp. 234-240 Except for a small amount of training on equipment during flight, all instruction was conducted within a highly restricted compound under 24-hour guard from the Marine Detachment. The compound, located on the north end of the island, had 16 instructional buildings and a large hangar with static aircraft. For training in flight, there was a hangar and a small fleet of planes at the nearby Naval Air Station. Closure NATTC Ward Island continued for some time after the end of WWII. In mid-1946, a Primary School was added. In its existence, the Secondary School graduated an estimated 10,000 students, many more when the special operations at the NATTC are added. All Navy activities at Ward Island closed in the early fall of 1947, with the instructional program transferring to NATTC Memphis at Millington, Tennessee. Higher Education Center In April 1947, the Baptist General Convention of Texas (BGCT) chartered a school as the Arts and Technological College (ATC). Originally intended to be located in Beeville, Texas, in July this was shifted to Corpus Christi, and ATC temporarily opened in September at Cuddihy Field, a surplus Navy auxiliary airfield on the outskirts of the city. The name was changed to the University of Corpus Christi (UCC) at that time, and the school began with 312 students and 24 faculty members.Kreneck, Thomas H.; \\"Introduction,\\" in Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi: The Island University; http://www.tamucc.edu/about/history.pdf University of Corpus Christi The Navy closed the NATTC on Ward Island in October 1947, and in November the UCC leased the property, including all of the buildings, for a dollar a year. (The UCC Board of Trustees later obtained full ownership of the property.) During the Christmas break, the school moved from Cuddihy Field to Ward Island and classes restarted in former training buildings on 5 January 1948. The first UCC graduation exercise was held for 29 students in May. For 26 years, UCC was the only four-year, degree-granting institution in Corpus Christi.Kreneck, op. cit. For the initial years, the original facilities from NATTC continued to be used for all purposes; the first permanent building, a women's dormitory, came in 1956. The most significant new structure was a large, circular library building opened in May 1963. In 1970, many of the wartime buildings were highly damaged by Hurricane Celia. From its start, the UCC had financial problems, and, to rebuild the campus, the Trustees sought assistance from the State. The Texas Legislature passed a bill allowing Texas A&I; University, located at Kingsville, Texas, to establish an upper-level institute at Corpus Christi. The UCC Trustees then transferred Ward Island to the city of Corpus Christi, which, in turn, transferred it to Texas A&I.; The last graduation exercise for UCC was in 1973. In making the land transfer, the BGCT retained 10 acres for student religious centers. Also at the time of the transfer, Corpus Christi incorporated Ward Island into its city limits. Texas A&M; at Corpus Christi Texas A&M; at Corpus Christi (TAMUCC) began courses for 969 students at the junior, senior, and graduate levels in the fall of 1973. Many of the damaged buildings were not rebuilt, and thus there was initially no on- campus student housing; intercollegiate athletics were also discontinued. There was a considerable demand in Corpus Christi area, however, for a school providing undergraduate degree-completion and masters-level graduate study. By the start of 1974, TAMUCC had over 1.200 commuting students and continued to grow in its initial three years. For publicity purposes, it adopted the name \\"Island University.\\"Kreneck, op. cit. Corpus Christi State University In 1977, the school became a part of the newly created University System of South Texas, and was renamed Corpus Christi State University (CCSU). Although a few dormitories and other permanent facilities were added, CCSU still used many of the original Navy buildings and remained primarily a school for commuting students. Nevertheless, there was steady growth over the next decade. By 1989, the school had more than 4,000 students and over 10,000 alumni.Kreneck, op. cit. Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi The State Legislature made CCSU a part of the expanding Texas A&M; University System in 1989, and in 1992, the Texas Higher Education Commission authorized CCSU's first doctoral program. In 1993, the Texas A&M; University System Board of Regents renamed the school Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC or A&M-Corpus; Christi). With the start of the 1994-1995 academic year, freshmen and sophomore students were also admitted, returning the institution to being a full undergraduate and graduate university. The intercollegiate athletic program was restarted in 1997, with basketball, baseball, tennis, track, and other sports using the name \\"Islanders\\" and competing in the Southland Conference.Kreneck, op. cit. In the following years, A&M; Corpus Christi continued growing in facilities, programs, and students. All of the wooden buildings from the Navy's NATTC were gone; new facilities include extensive student housing, major classroom buildings, a 1,500-seat Performing Arts Center, and the Harte Research Center. Designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, , there were over 10,000 students from 48 states and 67 foreign countries, and alumni exceeded 30,000. There are five colleges: Business, Education, Liberal Arts, Nursing and Health Sciences, and Science and Engineering. The faculty, administration, and others employees number about 1,400.\\"Fast Facts, Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi\\"; http://www.tamucc.edu/about/facts.html School of Christian Studies When the Baptist General Convention of Texas sold Ward Island, they retained 10 acres for student religious centers.

It is largely resident in wetland habitats in southern, central and eastern Africa from South Africa north to South Sudan. Description African marsh harrier, KwaZulu-Natal The adult is long, with females being about 30% heavier than males (Simmons and Simmons 2000). Adults, (like the male bird right) have yellow eyes, but brown eyes when immature. Both sexes are mostly brown with pale streakings on the head, breast, forewing and rufous on the thighs and the belly. Adult males differ from females in that they have a pale grey wash to the dorsal secondaries and primaries. The female's are brown. The juvenile is dark brown and may have a pale breastband and pale markings on the head. The tail and flight feathers have dark barring at all ages, but this is rarely visible in the juvenile birds. It resembles a small Eurasian marsh harrier but is slimmer and paler brown. It could be mistaken for an immature Montagu's harrier or pallid harrier, but the African marsh harrier can be readily distinguished from them by its lack of a white rump. It is usually silent but the male has a high-pitched, two-note display call, and only the female has the far-carrying ' food and copulation call during breeding. Habitat Generally found in marshes or reedbeds and hunts over open grasslands and cultivation near wetlands. Found from sea level up to 3000 metres, in east Africa it predominantly occurs above 1500 metres. Distribution Circus ranivorus is mainly resident in the moister regions of southern and eastern Africa, from the Western Cape northwards through eastern South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, eastern Zimbabwe, south and western Mozambique, Malawi, southwestern Tanzania, western and central Zambia, south eastern Angola into northern Botswana, especially in the Okavango Delta, and north eastern Namibia. Disjunct populations occur in northern Tanzania, another two in the south of Democratic Republic of Congo, another in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and south eastern Uganda; and the northernmost in north western Kenya, far north Uganda and South Sudan. Habits and ecology It has a varied diet which includes small mammals (70% of items) and adult birds, fledglings, lizards, frogs and large insects. It can sometimes consume birds up to the size of the Red-billed teal and the speckled pigeon. A favoured prey in some areas are doves, especially laughing doves. African marsh harriers are not found in areas with less than in annual rainfall as wetlands are sparse in regions with less rainfall, its main prey in southern Africa, the striped mouse Rhabdomys pumilio , is also restricted to this isohyet. It will also feed on larger animals such as flamingo carrion left by, for example, African fish eagles. Most prey is caught on the ground but birds and insects are often caught on the wing. Unlike many harriers, it is monogamous and remains on the breeding territory for most of the year. In the southern Cape, birds leave for a few months post-breeding, returning in May‚ÄìJune. The nest is usually built in a reedbed, sometimes well above the water and two to four white eggs are laid from July to November. All eggs start out with a blue wash allowing newly laid eggs to be identified. The African marsh harrier does not form communal roosts, unlike other harriers and normally roosts solitarily. It leaves the roost early in the morning and then flies slowly over the ground. It hunts in typical harrier fashion, usually less than 10 metres above the ground, over wetlands and adjacent drier ground. Conservation African marsh harriers are reported to be common at many wetland sites in both eastern and southern Africa, especially in Uganda, Botswana and Zambia. In South Africa, an estimated 3,000-6,000 pairs remain, but some populations are declining and the species is regarded as regionally endangered. Outside South Africa there are still large areas of suitable habitat, e.g. the Okavango Delta in Botswana and over much of Zambia, and the species is still locally common . The population is preliminarily estimated to number between 10,000-100,000 individuals. Populations are declining due to drainage and damming of wetland habitats, over-grazing and human disturbance and, possibly, pesticide poisoning.

The National Dairy Products Corporation became a majority investor in the company in 1929, and it became part of Kraft Foods in 1952. Founding Breaking and freezing of eggs began in U.S. in the 1890s in Minneapolis, Minnesota. George Dole, who owned one of the first cold storage facilities in the United States, and former school teacher H. J. Keith were the first to open an egg-breaking business, the H.J. Keith Company. They also began separating yolks from whites and selling them as separate products. In 1898, Keith made a deal with H. A. Perry of Salina, Kansas. Perry was the founder of Seymour Foods, and had invented a hand-operated yolk-and-white separator which dramatically improved productivity.The egg separator remained state-of-the-art technology from 1900 to the advent of World War II. Keith licensed this technology from Perry and dramatically increased production.Stadelman, Egg Science and Technology, 1995. Morris Ovson was a Russian citizen who emigrated to the United States in 1904 and became an American citizen in 1909. Ovson found employment as an egg candler for the H.J. Keith Company.\\"Frozen Eggs,\\" Time, April 12, 1937. In time, Ovson became a processing operations inspector and opened new production and processing facilities for the company. Keith also sent Ovson to Europe to learn how to produce dried eggs. In 1917, Keith sent Morris to Shanghai to open a new dried and frozen egg production company, the Amos Bird Company (which became part of The Borden Food Corporation). But Ovson did not want to move to China. He had married the former Ida Karelitz in 1910, and the couple had three young sons (Leo, Gene, and Hank). Leo and Gene joined Morris into the frozen egg business. Morris Ovson returned to the United States in 1919, formed a business partnership with Keith, and founded the Ovson-Keith Egg Company. To secure additional capital, C. J. Bowman and W. F. Priebe became investors and associates in the firm, and the company name was changed to the Bowman-Priebe- Ovson Company. 1920s On September 19, 1922, Morris Ovson was awarded a patent for \\"Mocoyolk\\" (U.S. Patent No. 1,429,559), a product which is 95 percent yolk and 5 percent glycerine which helps preserve the consistency of egg and keeps baked products moist. In 1929, the Bowman-Priebe-Ovson Company was reorganized and became the Ovson Egg Company. Financial difficulties created by the Great Depression led the National Dairy Products Corporation (now Kraft Foods) to invest in the company and take a non-controlling majority interest in the firm.\\"National Dairy Buys Two Concerns,\\" New York Times, September 20, 1929. 1930s and 1940s By 1937, the two largest processed egg companies in the United States were Standard Brands (which became part of Nabisco and eventually Kraft Foods) and the Ovson Egg Company. Ovson Egg had seven plants, located in Chicago, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; Dallas, Texas; Davenport, Iowa; Moberly, Missouri; Great Bend, Kansas; and Parsons, Kansas. The Shanghai plant was the largest egg processing facility in Asia. As the demand for eggs products soared during World War II, Ovson Egg's profits soared. Ovson Egg was one of the few American firms which manufactured dried and powdered eggs, and it became a significant supplier of egg products to the U.S. military. In 1948, Leo and Morris Ovson opened an Ovson Egg plant in Neosho, Missouri. The plant was built by R. A. Haas, owner of Haas Cold Storage. Haas leased space to Ovson Egg, and Haas Cold Storage handled the processed eggs. Sale and legal troubles In 1952, Kraft Foods purchased National Dairy Products. Ovson Egg became part of Kraft, although the Ovson Egg offices remained in Chicago. Shortly after the Kraft purchase, Morris and Leo Ovson were indicted on June 14, 1955, for perjury in a labor racketeering investigation. Both men lied to a federal grand jury about giving money to Joseph Glimco, president of Local 777 of the Taxicab Drivers Union, and to Max Podolsky, a union organizer for the Egg Inspectors Union. Joseph and Max were involved in the buying, selling, inspection and moving of eggs at the Fulton Street Egg Market in Chicago, one of the nation's largest egg trading boards. William Holloway, an accountant for Ovson Egg, was also indicted.\\"Indict Three for Perjury in Glimco Probe,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, June 21, 1955. Morris Ovson agreed to plead guilty to one charge in exchange for the district attorney dropping two additional charges against him and the lone charge against Leo Ovson. Due to his age, poor health, and retirement from the frozen egg business, Morris Ovson was not sentenced to prison but only to one year of probation.\\"U.S. District 12 Court Archives,\\" Cases 55.340 and 55.341 Morris Ovson died in 1961 at the age of 77.\\"Morris Ovson,\\" New York Times, September 7, 1961.

At most times, the line operates from the Patapsco Light Rail Stop in southern Baltimore with short turns at Jumper's Hole in Pasadena. The bus route, one of the longest local routes operated by MTA, is the successor to the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad interurban, and mainly operates along the parallel Ritchie Highway, serving Brooklyn Park, Glen Burnie, Pasadena, and Severna Park. When the Light Rail is not running, Route 14 runs all the way to downtown Baltimore, mostly along Hanover Street. While MTA used the zone system for its fares that was abolished in 1996, Route 14 was the only local bus that operated into Zone 5, the farthest out zone from Baltimore City, where the highest fares were paid. History MTA Maryland Neoplan operating the#14 line at the Cromwell Light Rail Station, with a destination of Jumper's Hole. The Annapolis and Baltimore Short Line Railroad began operating steam trains between Baltimore and Annapolis in 1887, and electrified their line in 1908. The Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad, formed in a 1935 reorganization, soon began operating buses to supplement its main line; buses replaced that main line on February 5, 1950. The MTA took over the bus route in 1973,Herbert H. Harwood, Jr., Maryland Online Encyclopedia, Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad, accessed April 10, 2007 and numbered it Route 14. The no. 14 designation was not used for any Baltimore-Annapolis service until 1973, and prior to this date, Baltimore- Annapolis transportation was unnumbered. No. 14 previously referred to a streetcar service that operated between Ellicott City and downtown Baltimore until 1954. The portion of this service as far west as Catonsville is now served by Route 23; Ellicott City service is offered on a limited basis by Route 150. When the Central Light Rail Line opened in 1992 along part of the old interurban line, Route 14 was truncated to the Patapsco stop during Light Rail operating hours, with selected trips deviating to Bay Meadow Industrial Park.MTA September 1992 schedule changes A deviation to serve the Cromwell Light Rail Stop was added in 1993 when this station opened.MTA September 1993 schedule changes In 1996, a new branch via Baltimore Annapolis Boulevard was added to replace a portion of Route 17 along this road that was eliminated.MTA winter 1996 schedule changes In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, it was proposed that Route 14 be split, with route 14 operating only between Patapsco and Jumper's Hole, and the new Route 41 serving Annapolis less frequently. Due to public outcry, this plan was not implemented. In 2008, Route 14 was split into two branches: One operates to Annapolis via the original route. The other operates to Jumper's Hole via a variation of this route to serve the Quarterfield Shopping Center, which is the location of a Wal-Mart Supercenter.

Written in the epistolary tradition, it consists entirely of e-mails written between the employees of an advertising agency and some of their business partners. Thus, the novel is a multiple-perspective narrative where events are seen through the eyes of various people working for the agency, from temp to CEO. e centres on corporate business structures, leadership, creativity, headhunting for and firing people to keep up appearances, work efficiency, business ethics, and all kinds of human weaknesses which stall progress by having employees waste their time and energy on unimportant things and which eventually prevent success. Beaumont worked as a copywriter himself before embarking on a literary career, and e is his debut novel. Plot summary The setting of e is the very beginning of the new millennium inside the London office of Miller Shanks, a prominent (fictitious) international advertising agency. When the novel opens two major projects are under way: the shooting, on location in Mauritius, of a commercial for a porn channel; and preparations for a sales pitch, with Coca-Cola as the company's prospective client. While the Coca-Cola advertising campaign is supposed to be kept confidential, David Crutton, the chief executive officer, is astonishingly computer illiterate and inadvertently sends carbon copies of every single one of his e-mails to the Helsinki office of Miller Shanks. Simon Horne, the creative director, has stolen the \\"original\\" idea on which the Coca-Cola campaign is based from two recent college graduates who are looking for work and does not believe that the past will ever catch up with him. In the end it does, but although the campaign can be patched up in the last minute with the help of the Helsinki office, Coca-Cola finally decide not to award their advertising account to Miller Shanks after one of their female top level managers has watched a secretly filmed video on the Internet showing Horne in his office having sex with a ladyboy, uploaded thanks to the efforts of Liam O'Keefe, who filmed it all taking place, and his friend Brett Topowlski. The shooting in Mauritius goes terribly wrong already during the flight to the island when the breast implants of one of the four models hired to appear in the video explode. Shortly afterwards, yet another model drops out due to hyperthermia, facts which force the creative team to continually rewrite the script. Bad weather makes filming impossible for a couple of days, but the last straw is an alleged sexual attack by the company's male client (\\"a fat lech\\") on television presenter Gloria Hunniford, who happens to be staying at the same hotel together with a BBC crew to film a holiday show. Miller Shanks encounter further complications when loose talk at the hotel bar by Topowlski and Vince Douglas, the two art directors for the commercial, triggers a headline in The Sun about the \\"Hunniford Affair\\". Subplots revolve around the frantic attempts of Ken Perry, the Office Administrator, at upholding order in the building; the ongoing love affair between O'Keefe and Lorraine Pallister; a not even half-hearted suicide attempt by Susi Judge-Davis, devoted PA to Simon Horne and Simon Horne alone; and Nigel 'Nige' Godley's failed endeavours to be recognized as both a good chum and a loyal workaholic. Characters *James F Weissmuller, President of Miller Shanks Worldwide (American)- an unfashionable, older gentleman nicknamed 'Tarzan' by the office staff for his build. He is a very traditional businessman, but enjoys maintaining good individual relationships with his employees. Throughout the book, thanks to Miller Shanks London's various blunders, Crutton becomes less and less popular with him. *Pertti van Helden, CEO of Miller Shanks Helsinki (Finnish)- a well- meaning and patriotic unintentional contact of Crutton's. van Helden (or Van Halen as he is later nicknamed) is inadvertently responsible for winning the Coca-Cola pitch after composing his own idea to rival Horne's, which Crutton relies upon after abandoning the stolen material despite his apparent hatred of all things Finnish. *David Crutton, CEO of Miller Shanks London (British)- a mildly racist and bad-tempered boss, described as a 'twatter' with 'an MBA from the Joseph Stalin School of Management' by Beaumont. He is somewhat of a victim of circumstance, but this is not helped by his poor treatment of his staff, particularly his PAs and anyone he sees as responsible for his ICT problems. He also fires Ken Perry for scheduling a fire drill during an important meeting, but the office rapidly dilapidates in his absence and he has to be re-hired. *Simon Horne, creative director of the London branch. Hated by everyone in the office apart from his over-devoted PA, Susi, Horne is thought of as incompetent by practically everybody. After being exposed as both a material thief and a customer of the local ladyboy, Horne vanishes from Mauritius. Simon is even worse than David when it comes to blaming others for his own faults, and does not shy at all away from trying to have Pinki fired to cover his tracks. *Daniel Westbrooke, Head of Client Services (London branch). Daniel means well, but at the end of the day is so-self absorbed he cannot do his job properly. He is obsessed with reminding everyone what his job is and its importance to the company, but Liam's guide to the office staff he sends to Lorraine says enough about what everyone else thinks of his position. *Harriet Greenbaum - replaces David as CEO after he is forced to move to Miller Shanks Bucharest. She is in charge of the marketing department prior to this, and is fond of Pinki. She is the most well-liked of the senior staff. *Melinda Sheridan - a very close friend of Harriet's, she produces the LOVE Channel trailer with the 'help' of Westbrooke, Douglas, Topowlski and Horne. She bears an uncanny resemblance to Gloria Hunniford, which causes the incident with the LOVE executive. She has a long line of successful advertisements under her belt, and her devotion to not blemish her perfect record is largely responsible for the success of the team in Mauritius. She is also a smoker, and tries to give up for the New Year- however, with everything from an exploding breast implant to a small hurricane going wrong, she gives in to the vice. *James Gregory - takes the blame for one of Simon's many mistakes about the Coca-Cola pitch, specifically his delay in having anything prepared. Also blamed for the loss of the Kimbelle Sanpro account. Son of Max Gregory. *Katie Philpott - Trainee account manager, described by Liam as a stalker, she is briefly indirectly responsible for their splitting up. However, it seems she only meant to be friendly. *Vince Douglas - an art director with little common sense and less spelling ability, he is popular with the other low-level staff. He is a technophobe and only sends one e-mail throughout the course of the novel, providing everyone with the link to the video of Simon and his ladyboy, despite his New Year's Resolution to become computer literate. He is fired after accidentally revealing a large amount of sensitive information to a Sun journalist. *Pinki Fallon - Liam's partner, Pinki is the most liberal and conscientious person in the book. She is the bane of Simon and Susi, despite being one of their best workers, because she firmly believes in honesty and integrity; qualities they respectively lack. She attempts to resign several times for various reasons, but is always swayed back in. She is responsible for Simon's fall when Brett and Vince reveal to her that the original pitch was stolen. *Liam O'Keefe - a troublemaker but a hard worker, Liam is a close friend of Brett and Vince. He frequently exchanges e-mails with them while they are in Mauritius while working on the Cola pitch with Pinki, and is the first to tell them that Crutton means to fire Vince, thereby inspiring them to go out with a bang. Lorraine catches his eye when she first joins as a temp, and later engages in a highly sexual relationship with him. Liam goes so far as to say to Brett that he loves her, and refers to her as \\"The future Mrs. O'Keefe\\" on the grounds that she has met his mother. *Brett Topowlski- long-time best friend of Vince, he is caught in the same predicament as him but is not actually fired because of his lesser role.

She is also not overly keen on Westbrooke. *Chandra Kapoor - originally head of IT, fired by Crutton when he cannot send emails without them reaching van Helden. *Peter Renquist - replaces Kapoor, but cannot stand Crutton's imbecilic, Draconian technophobia and resigns. He is the one who identifies Crutton's computer illiteracy is the reason for his e-mail trouble *Ravi Basnital - replaces Renquist. He is one of the few to be appraised by David throughout the book- he accordingly recommends framing the e-mail. *Nigel Godley - Beaumont calls him \\"the sad git in accounts.\\" Godley is somewhat of a Calvinist, believing both in the Christian God and maintaining a top-of-the- line work ethic. He is the fire officer for the accountancy department and is greatly disheartened when Liam's team beat him in fire drill evacuation time. He enjoys teleshopping and often sends all-staff emails reselling things he has bought, much to the grief of the IT department and Rachel, who tries to stop him. Nigel is very easily offended, and like Susi and Pinki threatens his resignation several times. He looks after Vince's cat Bruno while he is away in Mauritius, but over-feeds it. *Letitia Hegg - the local headhunter, she is apparently an old friend of Simon Horne's.

In 1947, the symphony was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music. Ives is reported to have given half the money to Lou Harrison, who conducted the premiere. Structure The symphony is in three movements: This symphony is notable for its use of a chamber orchestra, rather than the complete orchestra Ives used for his other symphonies. The symphony is also rather short, lasting approximately twenty minutes. Instrumentation The symphony is scored for a chamber orchestra of a flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, trombone, bells, and strings (violins, violas, cellos, and double basses). Composition The symphony has many influences including War songs, dances, and general European classical music. It evokes country meetings during his childhood, when people gathered in fields to sing, preach, and listen. Ives was sentimentally nostalgic, glancing back as a modern composer at a nineteenth-century childhood of hymns, bells, and children's games throughout the three movements. The symphony is filled with complex harmonies and meters. Premiere Although there is no conclusive evidence that Ives and Gustav Mahler ever met, Mahler had seen the manuscript and talked of premiering the symphony with the New York Philharmonic. There is also a story, which Ives put about, that Mahler took the score back to Europe, planning to conduct it there. Mahler's death in 1911 prevented any such performances, and the alleged score has never been located.danbury.org There was no further interest in the symphony until Lou Harrison, a great fan of Ives' music, finally conducted it in New York on 5 April 1946. Bernard Herrmann, another composer who became a friend of Ives, conducted a CBS broadcast performance of the symphony soon after. References 4\\\\. Zobel, Mark A. The Third Symphony of Charles Ives.

W. von Puttkamer, and Damerkow \\"B\\", with four tenants and one cottager, known as Niemietzke (now Podkomorzyce), in the ownership of Johann Christian Ernst von Puttkamer. The Polish name is based on the German name Puttkamerhof, which refers to the Puttkamer family. After 1800 a Herr von Zeromski became the owner of Schwarz Damerkow. Waldemar von Puttkamer bought the property from Zeromski, but Puttkamer continued to own it only until 1864. The last proprietors of Schwarz Damerkow mentioned in the estates book (G√ºteradre√übuch')' are: :1884 - Alexander Schulze :1910 - Ikier :1928 - Harry Ikier :1938 - Hertha Ikier.

Local folklore maintains that, while staying at the inn, Gerald learned of the miracle whereby the Anglo-Norman lord Philip de Braose was struck blind and saw his hunting dogs go mad when he disrespectfully used church as a makeshift hostel one night. He was told that his vision would only return if he resolved to leave his estates and fight in the Crusades.

It was associated with the site of Saint Afan's supposed martyrdom at the hands of invaders. In the 1700s, it housed a Latin grammar school. Evans, the eighty-year-old son of the last vicar to reside there, Rev Thomas Watkin Evans, witnessed the collapse of the building, after which the house was abandoned.

He is best known for designing and making various guitar models at Jackson Guitars, such as Jackson Rhoads and Jackson Soloist during the 1980s.  Biography  Jackson has been making guitars since 1973. In 1978, he started working at Wayne Charvel's guitar repair shop in Covina, California (while using a PO Box in neighboring San Dimas). Since Charvel's shop was almost bankrupted, Charvel eventually sold his interest to Grover Jackson on November 10, 1978, which gave Jackson control of the business and the Charvel brand. In 1980 he also launched the Jackson brand with the Randy Rhoads model. Although Jackson and Charvel Guitars became popular with the rise of hard rock and heavy metal music in that era, Grover Jackson sold the Jackson/Charvel brand to the Japanese manufacturer IMC (International Music Corporation) of Fort Worth, Texas, in 1989, and eventually left the company in 1990. From 1993 to 1996, Jackson worked for Washburn USA in Chicago. During this time he designed and supervised the \\"Chicago MG\\" and \\"Mercury\\" guitar and \\"Bantam\\" bass series. These models were advertised as \\"Grover Jackson's design\\" along with his photo. He also worked with Dimebag Darrell to design and build his signature guitars (Washburn Dime series).

It is a Registered Historic Place. History The Cliffs in 1931 The Cliffs was built in 1753 by Philadelphia merchant Joshua Fisher (1707‚Äì1783), the great-grandfather of Joseph Wharton. It overlooks the Schuylkill River from the east, just north of Girard Avenue Bridge and quite close to where Fountain Green Drive meets Kelly Drive along the river. It is a country house in the Georgian style, constructed in stone, with two stories and a basement, originally heated by double fireplaces on both floors and basement. The estate surrounding the house included a farm. The house was the location where Benjamin Franklin's daughter, Sarah Franklin Bache, and her sewing group made clothing and bandages for the Continental soldiers during the Revolutionary War. Joshua Fisher settled in Lewes, Delaware, marrying Sarah Rodman, and as a young man started a hat-making business using the locally plentiful animal skins. He developed a robust transatlantic trade in animal pelts and became wealthy, moving his family to downtown Philadelphia in 1746, and building the Cliffs as a country getaway. He brought his family to the Cliffs house and farm in the summer and they grew up interested in nature, with an appreciation of the Quaker testimony of simplicity. Fisher's son Samuel Rowland Fisher, his wife Hannah Rodman Fisher, and their three children, Sarah, Deborah, and Thomas, spent their summers in the house during the years 1793‚Äì1834. The house remained in the Fisher family for more than 100 years until the Fairmount Park Commission purchased it in 1868. The house was rented and maintained until the 1960s when it became vacant. The house had a substantial amount of woodwork and paneling. It was taken over and repaired in the 1960s by the Shackamaxon Society, a local civic group. Vandalism The Cliffs, south view, 2007 The Cliffs house was vandalized in the 1970s and 1980s, possibly due to publicity that the Fairmount Park Commission allowed city officials to live in the park's 45 historic houses rent-free. As a result of the news stories, the Park Commission decided to charge rent, but renters could not be found for some of the houses. Those that were occupied were thereby protected and maintained. The Cliffs was unoccupied from 1970, and due to a lack of funds, neither the Park Commission nor the Shackamaxon Society could maintain it. Fire The Cliffs, north view, 2017 The Cliffs burned on February 22, 1986, due to vandalism and arson. Firefighters were unable to extinguish the fire because their heavy trucks sank in the clay earth surrounding the house. The clay had been trucked into the site in order to cover an area near the house used as a dump for refuse from various municipal construction projects. Today, what remains of the Cliffs is a shell of masonry that can only hint at its history and former glory. It is visible from the Schuylkill Expressway and the West River Drive just north of the Girard Avenue bridge in the winter months when the foliage has dropped from the trees.

In April 1640 he was elected Member of Parliament for Cheshire in the Short Parliament. Civil War When the First English Civil War broke out between the king and parliament, Aston took part with the Royalists, and was in command at Middlewich in March 1643, when he was defeated by Sir William Brereton in the First Battle of Middlewich. The Royalists lost two cannons and five hundred stand of arms. Few were killed, but the prisoners included many of the principal Royalists who took part, and the town suffered at the hands of the Parliamentarians, who made free with the property of burgesses and the plate of the church. Aston escaped, but when a few days later he returned to Chester, he was placed under arrest at Pulford, where he wrote a defence of his conduct which furnishes a very minute account of the affair. William Axon stated in his biography on Aston in the DNB that this was an interesting picture of the civil war. Aston apparently freed himself from censure and rejoined the king's army and indeed is said to have suffered a second defeat from Brereton at Macclesfield in 1643.Davies, p. 76 He was afterwards captured in a skirmish in Staffordshire.

(32.7 x 36 cm), Brooklyn MuseumLorenzo di Niccol√≤ or Lorenzo di Niccol√≤ di Martino was an Italian painter who was active in Florence from 1391 to 1412. This early Renaissance artist worked in the Trecento style, and his work maintains influences of the Gothic style, marking a transitional period between the Gothic sensibilities of the Middle Ages while simultaneously beginning to draw on the Classical. Lorenzo's works were usually religious scenes in tempera with gold backgrounds. Education and Personal Life The exact year of Lorenzo‚Äôs birth is unknown, but should be approximately 1374, for the first recorded date of his existence is in 1392 when it is documented that Lorenzo and his mentor, Niccol√≤ di Pietro Gerini, painted frescoes in the church of San Francesco at Pisa.Siren, Osvald. \\"Lorenzo Di Niccolo.\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 36, no. 203 (1920): 77. https://www.jstor.org/stable/860950 Lorenzo is often erroneously cited as the son of Niccol√≤ di Pietro Gerini because he completed some works with the painter, and Lorenzo's work is stylistically similar to Gerini's. It is more likely that Lorenzo was simply trained in Gerini‚Äôs workshop; therefore, many of Lorenzo‚Äôs early works share similarities with the work of Gerini.John Richards. \\"Lorenzo di Niccol√≤.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed February 26, 2017, http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T051961 Lorenzo‚Äôs education was limited, as it is thought that he trained under Gerini in a bottega, and in a way that was not conducive to learning the highest levels of painting. Gerini‚Äôs work focused more on managing many artists on large projects than on working as a skilled painter.Siren, Osvald. \\"Lorenzo Di Niccolo.\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 36, no. 203 (1920): 72-78. https://www.jstor.org/stable/860950 Lorenzo's friend, painter Spinello Aretino was more influential to Lorenzo's personal artistic development. Lorenzo drew inspiration from Spinello‚Äôs large-scale frescos and the freedom of imagination in his works. Lorenzo's work was further influenced by Lorenzo Monaco, and to a greater extent by Mariotto di Nardo and Andrea di Giusto. Based on records, Lorenzo was a most likely a member of the Medici e Speziali guild around 1408, and was certainly a member of the Compagnia di San Luca in 1410. Lorenzo had a son, Piero, who was trained in painting at the Arte dei Medici e Speziali in 1422 and became a painter in his own right. At this time, Lorenzo had already died.  Career  Lorenzo di Martino, Coronation of the Virgin, 1402, tempera and gold on panel, 81.9 x 102.8 in (208 x 261 cm), SanS Domenico, Cortona Throughout his career, Lorenzo maintained Trecento traditions in his work, a style that he learned from Gerini. Lorenzo‚Äôs works, such as S. Giovanni and his enemy before the crucifix in Saint Miniato, serve as defining models of Florentine art‚Äôs transitional period at the beginning of the 15th century and connect the artist to the Florentine art circle and continued to work in a form of the late Gothic style well into the 15th century. This particular circle of Proto-Renaissance style Florentine artists was centered around artist Lorenzo Monaco. Although the Trecento period had technically ended by Lorenzo's time, this circle of artists continued to work in the style, which bridged the gap between the artistic styles of the Gothic and Renaissance periods. Many of Lorenzo di Niccol√≤‚Äôs works focus on his use of decorative patterns, and do not seem to be concerned with the classicizing naturalistic intentions of the majority of Renaissance artists working in 15th century Florence.Siren, Osvald. \\"Lorenzo Di Niccolo.\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 36, no. 203 (1920): 72-78. https://www.jstor.org/stable/860950 However, when compared with his contemporary, Mariotto di Nardo, it is clear that Lorenzo skillfully maintained a Gothic style while allowing his figures some sense of movement that does not exist in works by Mariotto di Nardo. The first surviving work that can be attributed to Lorenzo is a triptych of St Bartholomew Enthroned, with Scenes from his Life. In 1401 Lorenzo collaborated with his mentor, Gerini, and friend Spinello Aretino on an altarpiece entitled Coronation of the Virgin for Saint Felicita in Florence. Lorenzo's addition to this altarpiece was limited to the four saints on the left side of the predella. However, in January 1402 Lorenzo was commissioned to paint his own altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin, a polyptych for the predella of San Marco in Florence. In 1440, Cosimo and Lorenzo de' Medici had this altarpiece removed and replaced with a work by Fra Angelico, and Lorenzo's altarpiece was subsequently moved to San Domenico at Cortona. As he matured, Lorenzo's style transformed from one reminiscent of Giotto's style to a more elegant and linear style that was more in line with the works of artists such as Lorenzo Monaco. Together with Niccol√≤ di Pietro Gerini, Lorenzo painted some frescoes in the Chapterhouse of the convent of San Francesco (Prato) and the panel Coronation of the Virgin, once in Santa Felicita. Lorenzo carried the subject of Coronation of the Virgin into his work for the Medici Chapel in Santa Croce, Florence. This work, completed in 1409, can be found in the chapel's predella. Today Lorenzo's painting for the Medici Chapel is split between its original location and the Bagatti Valsecchi Museum in Milan. Lorenzo's painting of the Madonna and Child Enthroned with Sts. Christopher, Blaise, Sebastian, and Francis (c. 1410-1412) is now exhibited in the St Louis Museum of Art.St Louis Museum of Art tryptich in tempera. Furthermore, two salvers at the Metropolitan Museum of Art were attributed to the Studio of Lorenzo di Niccol√≤ by art historians Elizabeth Gardner and Federico Zeri. It has been proposed that the subject of these salvers is a story from Boccaccio's Comedia delle Ninfe Fiorentine.Amore e Virt√π: Two Salvers Depicting Boccaccio's \\"Comedia delle Ninfe Fiorentine\\" in the Metropolitan Museum, by Paul F. Watson and Victoria Kirkham, in the Metropolitan Museum Journal, pages 35-50. The last dated work that is attributed to Lorenzo is Virgin and Child with Saints, a polyptych in Saint Lorenzo a Collina at Mezzomonte from 1412.  S. Giovanni Gualberto and his Enemy Before the Crucifix in S. Miniato  320x320px S. Giovanni Gualberto and his enemy before the Crucifix in S. Miniato is emblematic of proto-renaissance art through its decorative pattern and denial of modern Quattrocento naturalism. Aspects of the stylization of this painting are characteristic of Lorenzo's other works, seen through angular figures, large hands, and bright colors. In color, the work features bright colors, with blue, red and yellow tones and a light-green background. The work depicts a popular legend of an 11th-century Florentine nobleman, and was a typical subject for late Trecento period and early Quattrocento artists. Here San Giovanni Gualberto and his enemy are in the church of San Miniato al Monte, which is outside of Florence. According to the legend, Giovanni Gualberto set out to kill the knight who had killed his brother, but when Giovanni confronted the knight, it was Good Friday and the knight was unarmed. Giovanni's enemy then knelt before him and begged for mercy in the name of the Crucified. Guivanni Gualberto proceeded to put down his sword and enter the church with the knight. Through his work, Lorenzo places a halo around Giovanni's head to reveal the moment that the crucifix in the church bowed as a symbol of approval of Giovanni's lack of violence, and the enemies continued to become friends. Lorenzo's depiction of this miracle veers from the traditional legend through the existence of the knight's weapons, which he has laid at his side.  Market  Seven auction results for sales of Lorenzo's work between January 1998 and October 2016 are a matter of public record through ArtNet. These works, mostly consisting of tempera on panel, generally have sold far beyond their estimated prices. Lorenzo‚Äôs works ultimately have sold between $40,250 and $870,596 based on these public records.  Major works  * S.

Early life and education MacLaren was the sixth of 11 children of John MacLaren, a farmer at Middleton of Boquhapple, Thornhill, Callander and his first wife Janet Downie. MacLaren was educated at the village school and at Stirling High School.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Basic Biographical Details ; accessed 20 February 2007. Architecture education and career In about 1868 he moved to join his three elder brothers in Glasgow and was articled to Salmon Son & Ritchie. In 1875, he moved to London, joined the Architectural Association and began work as an assistant to Richard Coad - who recommended MacLaren to the Royal Academy Schools in January 1876. During 1878, he was in the office of the Surveyor of Public Buildings for the County of Surrey. During the early 1880s, he lived at 40 Montpelier Square, London, with his brother Thomas, also an architect.'Montpelier Square Area: Other Streets', Survey of London: volume 45: Knightsbridge (2000), pp. 116-24.

In 1884, MacLaren went into partnership with Coad, but also began to develop his own practice, which he eventually established as an independent venture in late 1887 at 21 King William Street, London, having just won a competition to design Stirling High School and the patronage of Sir Donald Currie MP. That year, he was also commissioned to design a hotel for the Canary Islands Company at Las Palmas, a stopping place for Currie's Castle route, but became ill with tuberculosis. In various projects for Currie, he developed a strong architectural style that influenced Charles Rennie Mackintosh's designs for Windyhill (Kilmacolm) and the Hill House. His pupils included Sir Robert Lorimer. In 1886, while working on Ledbury Court, Herefordshire, MacLaren encountered the country chairmaker Philip Clissett at nearby Bosbury. The meeting resulted in an iconic ladderback chair that furnished many Arts and Crafts establishments, including the meeting room of the Art Workers Guild, and inspired Ernest Gimson to learn chairmaking from Clissett himself. Illness and death MacLaren caught a severe chill which brought on early symptoms of tuberculosis, a disease of which the MacLarens had a family history. At the age of 37 in October 1890, he died and was buried in Hampstead, London, England.

Beginning around 1789, for many years members of the Breidden Society, founded by John Dovaston (1740‚Äì1808), met near Rodney's Pillar for an annual festival of food, drink, poetry, and song; records of their meetings for 1809‚Äì15 are preserved at the Houghton Library of Harvard University (MS Eng 1168). There is a large quarry on the western and northern sides of Breidden Hill. The rock is a thick gabbroic-dolerite laccolith, which is a source of roadstone.Rawson, P. F. and Brenchley, P. J.

Roughly speaking, it states that a smooth enough function near a critical point can be expressed as a quadratic form after a suitable change of coordinates. The Morse‚ÄìPalais lemma was originally proved in the finite-dimensional case by the American mathematician Marston Morse, using the Gram‚ÄìSchmidt orthogonalization process. This result plays a crucial role in Morse theory. The generalization to Hilbert spaces is due to Richard Palais and Stephen Smale. Statement of the lemma Let (H, „Äà , „Äâ) be a real Hilbert space, and let U be an open neighbourhood of 0 in H. Let f : U ‚Üí R be a (k + 2)-times continuously differentiable function with k ‚â• 1, i.e. f ‚àà Ck+2(U; R). Assume that f(0) = 0 and that 0 is a non-degenerate critical point of f, i.e. the second derivative D2f(0) defines an isomorphism of H with its continuous dual space H‚àó by :H i x \\\\mapsto \\\\mathrm{D}^{2} f(0) ( x, - ) \\\\in H^{*}. Then there exists a subneighbourhood V of 0 in U, a diffeomorphism œÜ : V ‚Üí V that is Ck with Ck inverse, and an invertible symmetric operator A : H ‚Üí H, such that :f(x) = \\\\langle A \\\\varphi(x), \\\\varphi(x) \\\\rangle for all x ‚àà V.

The hymn is used in liturgy, at weddings and at the beginning of funeral services, and is one of the most popular hymns in the United Kingdom. \\"Lord of all Hopefulness\\" is commonly set to the melody of an Irish folksong named Slane. In English hymn books, where traditional folk tunes are used, the place of collection is sometimes attributed as the tune name, and this melody is named after the Hill of Slane, the site St. Patrick lit an Easter fire in defiance of the pagan king, L√≥egaire, near the village of the same name () in County Meath, Ireland. Slane is also the melody of another well-known hymn, \\"Be Thou My Vision\\", and of the hymn \\"Lord of Creation, to Thee be All Praise\\" by J. C. Winslow, whose lyrics are similar. There are two variants of this tune; the text of \\"Lord Of All Hopefulness\\" fits a metre of 10.11.11.11, and an anacrucial version of Slane must be used (with an upbeat on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th lines of each verse). Another variant of the tune, commonly used in Irish and Scottish hymnals (including the Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland), fits the 10.10.10.10 metre and is not suitable for \\"Lord of all Hopefulness\\". The tune has its origin as a traditional Irish tune, principally 'With my Love on the Road,' also known as 'The Banks of the Bann,' and still a commonly-performed trad tune. \\"Lord of all Hopefulness\\" has also been given its own tune, Miniver (originally in The BBC Hymn Book 1951), written by Cyril Vincent Taylor which acknowledges Jan Struther by reference to her famous text character \\"Mrs Miniver\\".Milgate, W.

As stated in Article 7, Section 16 of the West Virginia Constitution: \\"In case of the death, conviction or impeachment, failure to qualify, resignation, or other disability of the governor, the president of the Senate shall act as governor until the vacancy is filled, or the disability removed.\\" However, the Senate President may not always serve the whole remainder of the term, as the constitution also states: \\"Whenever a vacancy shall occur in the office of governor before the first three years of the term shall have expired, a new election for governor shall take place to fill the vacancy.\\" The West Virginia Constitution does not create or even mention the title of lieutenant governor. However, in 2000, the West Virginia Legislature adopted West Virginia Code chapter 6A, section 1-4(b), which says \\"the president of the Senate shall be additionally designated the title of lieutenant governor\\".

Madara Chennaiah an 11th-century cobbler-saint who lived during the reign of the Western Chalukyas and who is regarded by some scholars as the \\"father of Vachana poetry.\\" The word \\"vachanas\\" literally means \\"(that which is) said\\". These are readily intelligible prose texts. Jedara Dasimayya who lived in the mid 10th century is considered the first proponent of lingayatism. Later poets, such as Basavanna (1160), the founder of Lingayatism, prime minister of Southern Kalachuri King Bijjala II, considered Chennaiah to be his inspiration. Vachanas and Sharana movement Palm leaf with Vachanas (11th - 12th century). Basavaadi Sharana's Vachanas are their experiences in the process of God realization. About 800 sharanas practiced the technique and wrote their experiences in terms of Guru (Unmanifest Chaitanya), Linga (Manifest Chaitanya), Jangama (Pure consciousness of Lingatattva in one's prana), Padodaka (intimacy with the knower/source of Lingatattva), and Prasada (becoming lingatattva). As per record, this form exchange of experience of the realization of the God in group discussion has happened only in Karnataka by the sharanas mainly under the guidance of Basavanna, Channa Basavanna Allama Prabhu and Siddarameshwar. This fact has been attributed to the popularity of the movement. More than 200 Vachana writers (Vachanakaras) have been recorded and more than thirty of whom were women.Sastri (1955), p361Other well known Vachana writers were Chennabasava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, Kondaguli Kesiraja etc. (Narasimhacharya 1988, p20) Vachanas Vachanas are brief paragraphs, and they end with one or the other local names under which Shiva is invoked or offered Pooja. In style, they are epigrammatical, parallelistic and allusive. They dwell on the vanity of riches, the valuelessness of mere rites or book learning, the uncertainty of life and the spiritual privileges of Shiva Bhakta (worshiper of lord Shiva).Edward Rice, A History of Kannada Literature, 1921, Asian Educational Services, (Reprinted 1982), pp 56 The Vachanas call men to give up the desire for worldly wealth and ease, to live lives of sobriety and detachment from the world and to turn to Siva for refuge. Authors of a particular Vachana can be identified by the style of invocation of God (Basveshvara invokes \\"Kudala Sangama Deva\\", while Allama Prabhu invokes \\"Guheshwara\\", Akkamadevi invokes \\"Channa Mallikarjuna\\", Siddhrama (Siddheshwar) of Solapur invokes \\"Kapilasidda Mallikarjuna\\") in the vachana. The existing readings of the vachanas are mostly set by the European understanding of the Indian traditions. About 22,000 vachanas have been published. The government of Karnataka has published Samagra Vachana Samputa in 15 volumes. Karnataka University Dharwad has published collections of individual vachana poets. Jedara Dasimaiah is called the 'Adya Vachanakara' (The First Vachanakara). In spite of the large collection of Vachanas, there was no single place where all Vachanas could be obtained. The credit for restoring the Vachana literature goes to Vachana Pitamaha D. P.G Halakatti. He moved from door to door and collected and restored many Vachana literatures.

Family and education Charles Turner Cholmondeley was the younger of two sons born to George, Fourth Earl of Cholmondeley, who was created the first Marquess of Cholmondeley in 1815. His mother was Lady Georgiana Charlotte, second daughter and co-heir of Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. He was a direct descendant of Sir Robert Walpole, the first Prime Minister of Great Britain.Lodge, Edmund. (1877). The Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire as at Present Existing, p. 125. Like his grandfather, and his elder brother, Cholmondeley was educated at Eton. He then attended Christ Church, Oxford, but apparently left without a degree, as was relatively common among his generation. Cholmondeley's elder brother, George, succeeded to his father's title in 1827 as the 2nd Marquess of Cholmondeley. Career In 1822, Cholmondeley was elected to the House of Commons for Castle Rising, a seat he held until 1832, when the constituency was abolished by the Reform Bill. He remained out of Parliament for the next twenty years. In 1852, Cholmondeley was again successful for South Hampshire, representing it for the next five years until 1857. Cholmondeley was a member of the Canterbury Association from 27 March 1848. In 1870, Cholmondeley succeeded to his elder brother's title as the third Marquess of Cholmondeley and entered the House of Lords. Marriage and issue Cholmondeley Castle, Cheshire On 28 February 1825, Cholmondeley married Marcia Emma Georgiana Arbuthnot, daughter of Charles Arbuthnot, at Cholmondeley House, which was then in Piccadilly, London. They had eight children, of whom only two daughters survived him: * Marcia Charlotte Emma (22 November 1826 ‚Äì 7 April 1828) * Lady Charlotte Georgiana (4 February 1828 ‚Äì 17 August 1912) * Charles George (9 July 1829 ‚Äì 7 December 1869) * Lady Marcia Susan Harriet (18 April 1831 ‚Äì 10 June 1927) * Lord Henry Vere (4 October 1834 ‚Äì 25 February 1882) * Emma Caroline (11 November 1837 ‚Äì 26 January 1839) * Caroline Rachel (4 July 1840 ‚Äì 11 March 1863) Lands and estates Houghton Hall, ancestral home of the Marquess of Cholmondeley since the establishment of the title in 1815, has now opened some of its rooms and grounds to the public. The family seats are Houghton Hall, Norfolk, and Cholmondeley Castle, which is surrounded by a estate near Malpas, Cheshire.Caroline, Donald. \\"The new garden at Houghton Hall, King‚Äôs Lynn, Norfolk,\\" The Times (UK). 11 May 2008.

Position at court One moiety part of the ancient office of Lord Great Chamberlain is a Cholmondeley inheritance. Notes and Queries (1883 Jan‚ÄìJun), p. 42. This hereditary honour came into the Cholmondeley family through the marriage of the first Marquess of Cholmondeley to Lady Georgiana Charlotte Bertie, daughter of Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Portcullis: Deed of Covenant and Agreement between Lord Willoughby de Eresby, The Dowager Marchioness of Cholmondeley and the Marquis of Cholmondeley re the exercise of the Office of Hereditary Great Chamberlain (16 May 1829). The second, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh holders of the marquessate have all held this office, but Lord William did not take on the responsibilities of this court function. Death and succession Cholmondeley's wife died in 1878. Six years after her death, he himself died at Houghton Hall, aged 84. As both of his sons had died before him, Cholmondeley was succeeded in his titles by his grandson George, Earl of Rocksavage, who was the eldest son of his eldest son, Charles. Houghton Hall was leased out after his death in 1884 until 1916, after which it was restored by the 5th Viscount. Cholmondeley Castle was occupied by the 4th Marquess, who was fatally injured there.

Specialising in cableway transporters, he is regarded as the inventor of the transporter bridge, having been the first to patent the idea in 1887.Troyano, L.F., \\"Bridge Engineering - A Global Perspective\\", Thomas Telford Publishing, 2003 However, the first such bridge was in fact designed by Alberto Palacio, with Arnodin's help. Nine of the eighteen known examples of the transporter bridge may be attributed to him. Three of them still exist. They use the technology of both suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridges. Arnodin built a great number of second generation suspension bridges at the turn of the 20th century, and he also restored and consolidated a number of old first generation suspension bridges (before 1860): the aprons were reinforced and the old wire cables replaced by spirally-wound double torsion steel wire ropes, often with addition of a cable-stayed bridge (known structural modification under the name of ‚ÄúSyst√®me Arnodin‚Äù). His factory (for the production of prefabricated metal sub- structures) was established in Ch√¢teauneuf-sur-Loire. Vestiges of this factory were still visible a few years ago, and the chimney could still be seen, half ruined, between the Loire and railway. The Loire Fleet Museum, at Ch√¢teauneuf- sur-Loire, shows memories of these workshops: an old model of the Nantes transporter bridge, a section of steel wire rope manufactured by Arnodin and photographs.

Interior The H√¥tel de Bourbon-Cond√© is a h√¥tel particulier, a kind of large townhouse of France, at 12 rue Monsieur, 7th arrondissement of Paris. It was built for Louise Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon by architect Alexandre-Th√©odore Brongniart.Braham (1980), pp. 215, 216; Parker (1967), p 230; Levey (1995), p. 243; Web page with the floor plan of the building at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. It has sometimes been referred to simply as the H√¥tel de Cond√©, see Parker 1967; Horace Walpole's letter in Cunningham (1906), vol. 9, p. 14, but this name can result in confusion, as it was also used for the main Paris seat of the princes of Cond√©. History In 1780 the twenty-three-year- old unmarried daughter of the Prince of Cond√©, Louise Ad√©la√Øde, also known as Mademoiselle de Cond√©, requested permission to leave the convent of Panth√©mont, where she had been educated, to live in the world. To suit her station in life a generous site was purchased in the rue Monsieur on the Left Bank, where Brogniart erected a splendid house. Previously, while working for the marquis de Montesquiou in 1778, Brongniart had received permission to open the rue Monsieur, where he also built stables for the Count of Provence, and a h√¥tel for the Archives de l'ordre Saint-Lazare.Bauchal (1887), p. 615. This source calls the building the H√¥tel de Mademoiselle de Cond√© and incorrectly states that it was demolished sometime before 1887.Braham (1980), pp. 215, 216. The house was situated behind an enclosed court, entered through a central carriage passage, and faced a garden into which the central oval salon projected.Brongniart's drawings of the ground-level and superior floor plans and elevations at Gallica biblioth√®que num√©rique (Biblioth√®que nationale de France). By 1782 the menuisier (chair-maker) Georges Jacob had delivered seat furnishings to the amount of 13,958 livres and Jean-Fran√ßois Leleu, a prominent √©b√©niste (cabinetmaker), had rendered a bill for veneered case- pieces,Parker (1967), p 232. but no detailed contemporary description of the interiors survives: Horace Walpole mentioned this \\"H√¥tel de Cond√©\\" in passing as an exemplar of the latest French neoclassical taste, after he had his first view of the Prince of Wales's Carlton House, London, in September 1785.Cunningham (1906), vol. 9, p. 14. The garden was landscaped in the genre pittoresque, the informal \\"picturesque genre\\" that was one aspect of French Anglomania in the 1780s. From the Boulevard des Invalides, passing along the garden, an open iron fence gave passers-by a view of the principal facade, the garden front in its landscaped setting.Parker (1967), p. 233.Garden side of the H√¥tel de Bourbon-Cond√©: street view at Google Maps. In the forecourt, long stucco panels in low-relief of children engaged in Bacchanalian procession were supplied by Clodion (Claude Michel). The art historian Michael Levey has written that \\"the superb stucco decorations for the courtyard of the H√¥tel de Bourbon-Cond√© ... [are] wonderfully zestful and redolent of the Renaissance in [their] unforced, enchanted pagan air, bringing hints of the countryside of antiquity into late eighteenth-century urban Paris.\\"Levey (1995), p. 243.Clodion is known to have supplied stucco reliefs for several of Brogniart's schemes (Parker 1967), p. 237. The reliefs were eventually removed from the walls of the courtyard and have been conserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1959. Considerations of rank prevented the princesse de Cond√© from marriage, and in 1789 she escaped the first stages of the French Revolution; in 1802, in Poland she took the veil, and returned to Paris in 1816, to consecrate the rest of her life to religious work. She died in 1824, but she never again resided in Brogniart's H√¥tel de Cond√©. NotesSources * Bauchal, Charles (1887). Nouveau dictionnaire biographique et critique des architectes fran√ßais .

The name is derived from Greek roots meaning seven and wise and means the seven wise men. The Order was founded at New Orleans, April 6, 1852, by Alexander Leonard Saunders, and early members included ex-governors, ex-mayors, etc.Stevens, Albert C. Cyclopedia of Fraternities: A Compilation of Existing Authentic Information and the Results of Original Investigation as to the Origin, Derivation, Founders, Development, Aims, Emblems, Character, and Personnel of More Than Six Hundred Secret Societies in the United States E. B. Treat and Company, New York p.178 History The organization was originally called the \\"Seven Wise Men\\", and it may have been formed by graduates of the earlier Mystical Seven or Rainbow Society that were popular college fraternities in the South during this period. Albert Stevens noted at least a strong similarity in their rituals and nomenclature.Stevens pp.178-9 The Heptasophs themselves elaborated an ornate pseudohistory dating back to 1104 BC and \\"the first Zoroaster\\". Allegedly the ancient King of Persia would select six Magi who were skilled in both statecraft and occult arts and they would meet in a cavern beneath the royal palace at Ispahan. This was also how princes were trained but they were only admitted \\"by merit\\". The philosophy of these \\"Seven Wise Men\\" directed the affairs of the Persian Empire until their overthrow by Muhammad in 638 AD.Stevens p.177 What is known is that after being \\"introduced\\" in New Orleans in April 1852, a Grand Conclave of Louisiana was set in June of that year and incorporated in 1854. A \\"Supreme Conclave\\", or organization embracing several states was organized in 1857 and had its first \\"communication\\" (convention).Stevens p.176 The early growth of the organization was principally in the Southern states and it lost many members much of its influence during the Civil War. The group was always conservative with little effort being made to extend it into other areas.Stevens pp.179-80 After the Civil War the group began to grow again and during the early 1870s experienced a rapid growth in membership, reaching a high point of 4,000. The depression of the mid-1870s checked its growth and led to a movement for a general death benefit (local conclaves were allowed to create benefit options, but there were not overall benefits). When the Supreme Conclave rejected this idea the zeta Conclave of Baltimore forced a schism leading to the creation of the Improved Order of Heptasophs. There was an intense rivalry between the two groups for a few years, but this died down after the older order adopted its own benefit plan in 1880Stevens p.180 During the 1870s, the Order became popular among some German Americans and was said to have spread to Germany by 1877.Harrison W.Burton The history of Norfolk, Virginia Norfolk, Va., Norfolk Virginian job print p.242 Organization The order worked four degrees, the initiatory degree where the Persian pseudo-history is described, and three further degrees which illustrated the vicissitudes pursuing the course of duty. Also \\"[t]o satisfy the modern demand for a military feature\\" an optional uniformed rank was introduced. A life insurance branch, named the \\"endowment rank\\" was established in 1880 and was open to members in good standing who passed a medical exam. The amount paid was $300. Finally, there was the Heptsophian Mutual Benefit fund which gave aid to the widows, heir and assignees of the members, up to $500 on a 25 cent assessment. Wives of members were also eligible for membership in the Fund. Membership was open to white males over 18 who were of good moral character, believed in a Supreme Being, possessed a known reputable means of support, free from any mental or physical disability and were educated enough to fill out their own application. Each local conclave could set its own upper age limit. There was no female auxiliary. The organization was typical of the day with local Subordinate Conclaves, statewide Grand Conclaves and the Supreme Conclave at the top. Grand Conclaves were composed of Past Archons of Subordinate Conclaves and the Supreme Conclave composed of Past Grand Archons. At its height the group was present in 18 states, principally in the South.Stevens pp.176, 180 ReferencesPublications=Serials *The Heptasoph. New Orleans : [s.n.], L.R. Simmons & Co.) 1869-?

Early life and education Claudine Muno spent her childhood in southern Luxembourg town of P√©tange and finished secondary school with a diploma in modern languages, literature, and Latin. She received an undergraduate degree in History at the University of Strasbourg, France, where she wrote a dissertation on Luxembourgish film: Peur de l'oubli - Peur de l'autre. Les films et documentaires luxembourgeois ayant pour sujet la Deuxi√®me Guerre Mondiale (French: Fear of forgetting, fear of the Other. Luxembourgish films and documentaries covering the Second World War). Career After graduating, she became the full-time cultural editor of the Luxembourgish weekly left/green-wing magazine woxx. As of 2007, she has been teaching music in the Neie Lyc√©e, a pilot secondary school in Luxembourg City. Author In 1996, Muno's first publication was a triple surprise for the Luxembourgish book market: the author was not only female (which was rare until then), she was also young (16 years old), and she wrote in English, a language rarely used in Luxembourg literature. In the following years, Muno has published a novel in French, one in German, and three in Luxembourgish. She has also co-authored two children picture storybooks with Pascale Junker who did the illustrations, and she has written two plays in Luxembourgish: Speck and Krakullen. Book critics have compared her writing style to the Belgian writer Am√©lie Nothomb. Musician Although Muno's first CD was first published by her book publisher, she is nationally and internationally known as Claudine Muno and The Luna Boots, who have already produced two albums. Much to her dismay, her singing style and voice has sometimes been compared to Jewel and Alanis Morissette.

Baron Three Clubs The Baron Three Clubs is an alternative to the responder using Stayman over a 2NT opening bid. The responder will have five points or more and an unbalanced hand. The responder bids 3, which asks opener to bid his four-card suits in ascending order. If clubs are the only four-card suit, the opener bids 3NT. If there are two four-card suits (one being clubs), the opener bids the higher first and then 3NT for the clubs if no fit is found. The opener's 2NT is a limited bid and the responder has not shown the strength of his hand, therefore the responder will control how high the bidding goes, game or prospecting for a slam, and the suit to be played. The main advantage of this convention is that it becomes easier to reach minor-suit slams. Baron Notrump Overcall A 1NT overcall is used over an opponent's opening suit bid to show a weak hand with support for the unbid suits and shortness in the opponent's suit, a doubleton at most. Maximum strength is thirteen points and the minimum depends on vulnerability and partnership agreement. Baron Two Notrump Response When the opening is a bid of one of a suit, a 2NT response is given showing 16-18 points and a generally flat hand. 3NT shows 13-15 points. This is also known as the Two Notrump Forcing Response. Baron Two Spades and Three Spades After a 1NT opening, a 2 response asks opener whether he is minimum or maximum for his bid. Opener responds 2NT with a minimum or at the three-level in his lowest four-card suit with a maximum. Responder may have one of two ranges: 11-12 points (looking for game in notrump) or 17-20 points (looking for slam in notrump or a minor suit). Similarly after a 2NT opening, 3 asks opener whether he is minimum or maximum, looking for a slam.

Its inhabitants are nicknamed the \\"Turks\\" by the neighbouring towns and villages. It is believed that the inhabitants refused to join the crusades against the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, and were called as Turks consequently. Another (more likely) reason could be that the inhabitants did not have to pay the taxes collected by the monks of the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy for the war against the Turkish empire, since Faymonville was part of the Duchy of Luxembourg, contrary to the other Walloon villages of the area. The inhabitants of these villages therefore would have called the inhabitants of Faymonville the \\"Turks\\". To protest, the latter adopted crescent and star as their symbols wearing them and dressing their building. This later became a tradition. It was even once told that when the villagers were to gather in the church, they did not use the bells but a call to church like the call to prayer in Turkey. This has however never been really assessed and should be viewed more as a legend. Every year the town celebrates their connection to Turks and the inhabitants now call themselves Turks. The town was part of the Eupen-Malmedy area transferred from Germany to Belgium in 1919. It was annexed to Germany occupation 1940‚Äì1945. During the battle of the Bulge, the town has been severely shelled and more than 50% of the buildings were completely destroyed, most the remaining ones incurring severe damages.

He painted mainly in his native city, as well as in Rome, where he was active from the beginning of the 17th century until around 1640. He was employed by Pope Sixtus V in the decoration of the library of the Vatican and in the decoration of the Scala Santa in San Giovanni Laterano. In the latter, he painted, Moses striking the Rock and Moses with the Brazen Serpent. Said to have been a pupil of Federico Barocci, Lilio created a popular niche for himself by painting allegories for aristocratic audiences. In fact, it is altogether possible that Lilio collaborated for the illustrations of Cesare Ripa's Iconologia, which was a popular source for such motifs for a very long time. He died at Ascoli Piceno. In a chapel of the Chiesa Nuova, he painted The Archangel Michael driving fallen angels from Heaven. He continued to ornament churches and convents of Rome during the reign of Pope Clement VIII. One of his masterpieces, the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence, was painted for Santa Caterina in Ancona. He painted the Christ Washing the Feet of His Disciples for the nave of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. He also was part of the team active in the painting of the Sistine chapel (chapel of Nativity) in Santa Maria Maggiore. For the cathedral of Fano, he painted a picture of All Saints.

While local chapters or Conclaves were allowed to pay benefits at option since 1872, others wanted a general fund for death benefits.

Thurn, all of Maryland, for a convention to found a new society. It was addressed to fourteen other Heptasophs, six each from Maryland and Pennsylvania and one each from Virginia and Kentucky. The convention assembled on August 27 at the Odd Fellows Hall in Philadelphia. There were only twenty delegates, the six signers of the call and the fourteen addressees. Nevertheless, they organized themselves as the Supreme Conclave of the new Improved Order of Heptasophs, with Judge Metzel as the first Archon Stevens p.137 The organization grew slowly, with the 83 members of the Zeta Conclave as the core of the membership. At the first ordinary annual session of the order, in 1879, there were only 149 members in nine local conclaves and by 1880 it had 516 in 12 conclaves. This was partly due to intense opposition from the older Order. However, by 1899 it grew to 35,000 members in twenty states, 12,000 in Maryland alone.Stevens pp.137-8 The organization reached a membership of 676,887 in 1915, at its peak.Schmidt, Alvin J.

The Fraternal Aid Union changed its name to the Standard Life Association in 1933.Schmidt p.155 The Standard Life Association in turn became Standard Mutual Life, a mutual company, in 1968.  Organization  Unusually for a nineteenth century American fraternal order, the Improved Order of Heptasophs dispensed with the state or \\"Grand\\" level of organization and consisted only of the local Subordinate Conclaves and the Supreme Conclave, which had control over the groups business and beneficiary activities.

It is located in the historic region of Lower Silesia. The town lies approximately south of Z≈Çotoryja, and west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. As of 2019, the town has a population of 3,668. History Park in Wojciesz√≥w The history of Wojciesz√≥w dates back to the Middle Ages, when it was part of the Piast-ruled Kingdom of Poland. Its name comes from the Polish male name Wojciech. The settlement was probably founded in the 12th century, the legend of the Polish knight Wojciesz Paszowic refers to the founding of the settlement. The oldest known mention of Wojciesz√≥w comes from 1268. There was a castle already in the 1367, when it was still under the rule of local Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty. In later periods the settlement was also part of Bohemian Crown, Hungary and Austria. The settlement suffered during the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century and in 1740 it was annexed by Prussia. It was then known under the Germanized name Kauffung. In 1753 it suffered a fire and during the Napoleonic Wars, French troops were stationed there in 1806‚Äì1808. Part of Germany from 1871, during World War II the Germans brought Soviet and French prisoners of war to the town as forced labour. In May 1945 the town was captured by the Soviets, and afterwards it became again part of Poland. It was repopulated by Poles, expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, and also those returning from the west. Wojciesz√≥w was granted town rights in 1973. Sights Among the preserved historic architecture of the town are six palaces, ranging from Renaissance to Renaissance Revival and Gothic Revival, and two churches: the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, dating back to the 14th century, and the 18th-century Church of Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati.

Landslides can be triggered by many, sometimes concomitant causes. In addition to shallow erosion or reduction of shear strength caused by seasonal rainfall, landslides may be triggered by anthropic activities, such as adding excessive weight above the slope, digging at mid-slope or at the foot of the slope. Often, individual phenomenon join together to generate instability over time, which often does not allow a reconstruction of the evolution of a particular landslide. Therefore, landslide hazard mitigation measures are not generally classified according to the phenomenon that might cause a landslide. Instead, they are classified by the sort of slope stabilization method used: * Geometric methods, in which the geometry of the hillside is changed (in general the slope); * Hydrogeological methods, in which an attempt is made to lower the groundwater level or to reduce the water content of the material * Chemical and mechanical methods, in which attempts are made to increase the shear strength of the unstable mass or to introduce active external forces (e.g. anchors, rock or ground nailing) or passive (e.g. structural wells, piles or reinforced ground) to counteract the destabilizing forces. Each of these methods varies somewhat with the type of material that makes up the slope. Rock slopes=Reinforcement measures Anchor structure Reinforcement measures generally consist of the introduction of metal elements which increase the shear strength of the rock and to reduce the stress release created when the rock is cut. Reinforcement measures are made up of metal rock nails or anchors. Anchorage subjected to pretensioning is classified as active anchorage. Passive anchorage, not subjected to pretensioning, can be used both to nail single unstable blocks and to reinforce large portions of rock. Anchorage can also be used as pre-reinforcement elements on a scarp to limit hillside decompression associated with cutting. Parts of an anchorage include: * the header: the set of elements (anchor plate, blocking device, etc.) that transmit the traction strength of the anchor to the anchored structure or to the rock * the reinforcement: part of the anchor, concreted and otherwise, placed under traction; can be constituted by a metal rod, a metal cable, a strand, etc. * the length of the foundation: the deepest portion of the anchor, fixed to the rock with chemical bonds or mechanical devices, which transfer the load to the rock itself * the free length: the non-concreted length. Positioning of anchors and nails in an unstable rocky hillside When the anchorage acts over a short length it is defined as a bolt, which is not structurally connected to the free length, made up of an element resistant to traction (normally a steel bar of less than 12 m protected against corrosion by a concrete sheath). The anchorage device may be connected to the ground by chemical means, mechanical expansion or concreting. In the first case, polyester resin cartridges are placed in a perforation to fill the ring space around the end part of the bolt. The main advantage of this type of anchorage lies in its simplicity and in the speed of installation. The main disadvantage is in its limited strength. In the second case, the anchorage is composed of steel wedges driven into the sides of the hole. The advantage of this type of anchorage lies in the speed of installation and in the fact that the tensioning can be achieved immediately. The main disadvantage with this type of anchorage is that it can only be used with hard rock, and the maximum traction force is limited. In the third case, the anchorage is achieved by concreting the whole metal bar. This is the most-used method since the materials are cheap and installation is simple. Injected concrete mixes can be used in many different rocks and grounds, and the concrete sheath protects the bar from corrosion. The concrete mixture is generally made up of water and cement in the ratio W/C = 0.40-0.45, producing a sufficiently fluid mixture to allow pumping into the hole, while at the same time, providing high mechanical strength when set. As far as the working mechanism of a rock nail is concerned, the strains of the rock induce a stress state in the nail composed of shear and traction stress, due to the roughness of the joints, to their opening and to the direction of the nail, generally non-orthogonal to the joint itself. The execution phases of setting up the nail provides for: * formation of any header niche and perforation * setting up of a reinforcement bar (e.g. a 4‚Äì6 m long FeB44k bar) * concrete injection of the bar * sealing of the header or of the top part of the hole It is anyway opportune to close up and cement any cracks in the rock to prevent pressure caused by water during the freeze-thaw cycles from producing progressive breaking in the reinforcement system set up. To this purpose a procedure is provided for of: * cleaning out and washing of the cracks; * plastering of the crack; * predisposition of the injection tubes at suitable inter-axes, parallel to the crack, through which the concrete mix is injected; * sequential injection of the mixture from bottom to top and at low pressure (1-3 atm.) until refusal or until no flow back of the mixture is noted from the tubes placed higher up. The injection mixtures have approximately the following composition: :cement 10 kg; :water 65 l :fluidity and anti-shrinkage additive or bentonite 1-5 kg. = Shotcrete= As defined by the American Concrete Institute, shotcrete is mortar or concrete conveyed through a hose and pneumatically projected at high velocity onto a surface. Shotcrete is also called spray-concrete, or spritzbeton (German). =Drainage= The presence of water within a rocky hillside is one of the major factors leading to instability. Knowledge of the water pressure and of the runoff mode is important to stability analysis, and to planning measures to improve hillside stability. Hoek and Bray (1981) provide a scheme of possible measures to reduce not only the amount of water, which is itself negligible as a cause of instability, but also the pressure applied by the water. The proposed scheme was elaborated taking three principles into account: * Preventing water entering the hillside through open or discontinuity traction cracks * Reducing water pressure in the vicinity of potential breakage surfaces through selective shallow and sub-shallow drainage. * Placing drainage in order to reduce water pressure in the immediate vicinity of the hillside. The measures that can be achieved to reduce the effects of water can be shallow or deep. Shallow drainage work mainly intercepts surface runoff and keeps it away from potentially unstable areas. In reality, on rocky hillsides this type of measure alone is usually insufficient to stabilise a hillside. Deep drainage is the most effective. Sub horizontal drainage is very effective in reducing pore-pressure along crack surfaces or potential breakage surfaces. In rocks, the choice of drain spacing, slope, and length is dependent on the hillside geometry and, more importantly, the structural formation of the mass. Features such as position, spacing and discontinuity opening persistence condition, apart from the mechanical characteristics of the rock, the water runoff mode inside the mass. Therefore, only by intercepting the mostly drained discontinuities can there be an efficient result. Sub horizontal drains are accompanied by surficial collectors which gather the water and take it away through networks of small surface channels. Vertical drainage is generally associated with sunken pumps which have the task of draining the water and lowering the groundwater level. The use of continuous cycle pumps implies very high running costs conditioning the use of this technique for only limited periods. Drainage galleries are rather different in terms of efficiency. They are considered to be the most efficient drainage system for rocks even if they have the drawback of requiring very high technological and financial investment. In particular, used in rocks this technique can be highly efficient in lowering water pressure. Drainage galleries can be associated with a series of radial drains which augment their efficiency. The positioning of this type of work is certainly connected to the local morphological, geological and structural conditions. Geometry modification This type of measure is used in those cases in which, below the material to be removed, the rock face is sound and stable (for example unstable material at the top of the hillside, rock blocks thrusting out from the hillside profile, vegetation that can widen the rock joints, rock blocks isolated from the joints). Detachment measures are carried out where there are risk conditions due to infrastructures or the passage of people at the foot of the hillside. Generally this type of measure can solve the problem by eliminating the hazard. However, it should be ensured that once the measure is carried out, the problem does not re-emerge in the short term. In fact, where there are very cracked rocks, the shallower rock portions can undergo mechanical incoherence, sometimes encouraged by extremes of climate, causing the isolation of unstable blocks. The measure can be effected in various ways, which range from demolition with pick axes to the use of explosives. In the case of high and/or not easily accessible faces it is necessary to turn to specialists who work acrobatically. When explosives are used, sometimes controlled demolition is needed, with the aim of minimising or nullifying the undesired effects resulting from the explosion of the charges, safeguarding the integrity of the surrounding rock. Controlled demolition is based on the drilling of holes placed at a short distance from each other and parallel to the scarp to be demolished. The diameter of the holes generally varies from 40 to 80 mm; the spacing of the holes is generally about 10 to 12 times the diameter. The charge fuse times are established so that those at the outer edges explode first and the more internal ones successively, so that the area of the operation is delimited. Protection measures A boulder catching net on a trail at Multnomah Falls, Oregon, USA, erected to protect hikers from debris falling down the steep incline. The protection of natural and quarry faces can have two different aims: * Protecting the rock from alteration or weathering * Protecting infrastructure and towns from rockfalls. Identification of the cause of alteration or the possibility of rockfall allows mitigation measures to be tailored to individual sites. The most-used passive protection measures are boulder-gathering trenches at the foot of the hillside, metal containment nets, and boulder barriers. Boulder barriers are generally composed of suitably rigid metal nets. Various structural types are on the market, for which the manufacturers specify the kinetic energy of absorption based on an elemental analysis of the structure under projectile collision conditions. Another type of boulder containment barrier is the earth embankment, sometimes reinforced with geo-synthetics (reinforced ground). The advantages of such earthworks over nets are: easier maintenance, higher absorption of kinetic energy, and lower environmental impacts. Soil slopes=Geometric modification The operation of re-profiling a slope with the aim of improving its stability, can be achieved by either: * Lowering the angle of the slope, or * Positioning infill at the foot of the slope Slope angles can be reduced by digging out the brow of the slope, usually in a step- wise fashion. This method is effective for correcting shallow forms of instability, where movement is limited to layers of ground near the surface and when the slopes are higher than 5m. Steps created by this method may also reduce surface erosion. However, caution is necessary to avoid the onset of local breakage following the cuts. In contrast, infill at the foot of the slope has a stabilising effect on a translational or deep rotational landslide, in which the landslide surface at the top submerges and describes a sub-vertical surface that re-emerges in the area at the foot of the slope. The process of infill at the foot of the slope may include construction of berms, gravitational structures such as gabions, or reinforced ground (i.e., concrete blocks). The choice between reducing the slope or infilling at the foot is usually controlled by location-specific constraints at the top or at the foot of the slope. In cases of slope stabilisation where there are no constraints (usually natural slopes) a combination of slope reduction and infilling at the foot of the slope is adopted to avoid heavy work of just one type. In the case of natural slopes the choice of re-profiling scheme is not as simple as that for artificial slopes. The natural profile is often highly irregular with large areas of natural creep, so that its shallow development can make some areas unserviceable as a cutting or infill point. Where the buried shapes of older landslides are complicated, depositing infill material in one area can trigger a new landslide. When planning this type of work the stepping effect of the cuts and infill should be taken into account: their beneficial influence on the increase in safety factor will be reduced in relationship to the size of the landslide under examination. It is very important to ensure that neither the cuts nor the infill mobilise any existing or potential creep plane(s). Usually, infilling at the foot of the landslide is cheaper than cutting at the top. Moreover, in complex and compound landslides, infill at the foot of the slope, at the tip of the foot itself, has a lesser probability of interfering with the interaction of the individual landslide elements. An important aspect of stabilisation work that changes the morphology of the slope is that cuts and infill generate non-drained charge and discharge stresses. In the case of positioning infill, the safety factor SF, will be less in the short term than in the long term. In the case of a cut in the slope, SF will be less in the long term than in the short term. Therefore, in both cases the SF must be calculated in both the short and long terms. Finally, the effectiveness of infill increases with time so long as it is associated with an appropriate infill drainage system, achieved with an underlying drainage cover or appropriate shallow drainage. More generally, therefore, re-profiling systems are associated with and integrated by surficial protection of the slope against erosion and by regulation of meteoric waters through drainage systems made up of ditches and small channels (clad or unclad and prefabricated) to run off the water collected. These surficial water regulation systems are designed by modelling the land itself around the body of the landslide. These provisions will serve the purpose of avoiding penetration of the landslide body by circulating water or into any cracks or fissures, further decreasing ground shear strength. Surface erosion control Water near the surface of the hillside can cause the erosion of surface material due to water runoff. This process tends to weaken the slope by removing material and triggering excess pore pressures due to the water flow. For defense against erosion, several solutions may be used. The following measures share the superficial character of their installation and low environmental impact. * Geomats are anti-eroding biomats or bionets that are purpose-made synthetic products for the protection and grassing of slopes subject to surface wash. Geomats provide two main erosion control mechanisms: containment and reinforcement of the surficial ground; and protection from the impact of the raindrops. * Geogrids made of geosynthetic materials * Steel wire mesh may be used for soil and rock slope stabilization. After leveling, the surface is covered by a steel-wire mesh, which is fastened to the slope and tensioned. It is a cost-effective approach. * Wicker or brushwood mats made of vegetable material. Very long and flexible willow branches can be used, which are then covered with infill soil. Alternating stakes of different woody species are used and they are woven to form a barrier against the downward drag of the material eroded by free water on the surface. * Coir (coconut fiber) geotextiles are used globally for bioengineering and slope stabilization applications due to the mechanical strength necessary to hold soil together. Coir geotextiles last for 3‚Äì5 years depending on the weight, and as the product degrades, it converts itself it to humus, which enriches the soil. Draining techniques Surface water run off system by prefabricated channelsMicro-perforated flexible drainage tubes Drainage systems reduce the water level inside a potentially unstable hillside, which leads to reduction in pore water pressures in the ground and an increase in the shear strength within the slope. The reduction in pore pressure by drainage can be achieved by shallow and/or deep drains, depending on hillside morphology, the kinematics of movement predicted and the depth of creep surfaces. Usually, shallow drainage is adopted where the potential hillside movement is shallow, affecting a depth of 5-6m. Where there are deeper slippage surfaces, deep drainage must be introduced, but shallow drainage systems may also be installed, with the aim of running off surface water. =Shallow drainage= Typical shallow drainage trenches Shallow drainage is facilitated through trenches. Traditional drainage trenches are cut in an unbroken length and filled with highly permeable, granular, draining material. Shallow drainage trenches equipped with geocomposites: typical scheme Shallow drainage trenches may also be equipped with geocomposites. The scarped sides of the trenches are covered with geocomposite panels. The bottom of the trenches houses a drainage tube placed in continuity to the geocomposite canvas. =Deep drainage= Deep drainage modifies the filtration routes in the ground. Often more expensive than shallow drains, deep drains are usually more effective because they directly remove the water that induces instability within the hillside. Deep drainage in earth slopes can be achieved in several ways: Large diameter drainage wells with sub-horizontal drains These systems can serve a structural function, a drainage function, or both. The draining elements are microdrains, perforated and positioned sub-horizontally and fanned out, oriented uphill to favour water discharge by gravity. The size of the wells is chosen with the aim of allowing the insertion and functioning of the perforation equipment for the microdrains. Generally, the minimum internal diameter is greater than 3.5 m for drains with a length of 20 to 30 m. Longer drains require wells with a diameter of up to 8‚Äì10 m. To determine the network of microdrains planners take into consideration the makeup of the subsoil and the hydraulic regime of the slope. The drainage in these wells is passive, realised by linking the bottom of adjacent wells by sub-horizontal perforations (provided with temporary sheathing pipes) in which the microdrains are placed at a gradient of about 15-20¬∞ and are equipped with microperforated PVC pipes, protected by non-filtering fabric along the draining length. Once the drain is embedded in the ground, the temporary sheathing is completely removed and the head of the drain is cemented to the well. In this way a discharge line is created linking all the wells emerging to the surface downhill, where the water is discharged naturally without the help of pumps. The wells are placed at such a distance apart that the individual collecting areas of the microdrains, appertaining to each well, are overlaid. In this way all the volume of the slope involved with the water table is drained. Medium-diameter drainage wells linked at the bottom. The technique involves the dry cutting with temporary sheathing pipes, of aligned drainage wells, with a diameter of 1200‚Äì1500 mm., positioned at an interaxis of 6‚Äì8 m., their bottoms linked together to a bottom tube for the discharge of drained water. In this way the water discharge takes place passively, due to gravity by perforated pipes with mini-tubes, positioned at the bottom of the wells themselves. The linking pipes, generally made of steel, are blind in the linking length and perforated or windowed in the length corresponding to the well. The wells have a concrete bung at the bottom and are filled, after withdrawal of the temporary sheathing pipe, with dry draining material and are closed with an impermeable clay bung. In normal conditions, these wells reach a depth of 20‚Äì30 m, but, in especially favourable cases, may reach 50 m. Some of these wells have drainage functions across their whole section and others can be inspected. The latter serve for maintenance of the whole drainage screen. Such wells that can be inspected are also a support point for the creation of new drainage wells and access for the installation, also on a later occasion, for a range of sub-horizontal drains at the bottom or along the walls of the wells themselves, with the purpose of increasing the drainage capacity of the well.  Isolated wells fitted with drainage pumps  This system provides for the installation of a drainage pump for each well. The distribution of the wells is established according to the permeability of the land to be drained and the lowering of the water pressure to be achieved. The use of isolated wells with drainage pumps leads to high operational costs and imposes a very time-consuming level of control and maintenance.  Deep drainage trenches  Deep drainage trenches consist of unbroken cuts with a small cross-section that can be covered at the bottom with geofabric canvas having a primary filter function. They are filled with draining material that has a filtering function and exploits the passive drainage to carry away the drained water downhill. The effectiveness of these systems is connected to the geometry of the trench and the continuity of the draining material along the whole trench. As far as the geometry of the cut is concerned attention should be paid to the slope given to the bottom of the cut. In fact, deep drainage trenches do not have bottom piping that is inserted in the end part of the trench, downhill, where the depth of the cut is reduced until the campaign level is reached.  Drainage galleries fitted with microdrains  Drainage galleries constitute a rather expensive stabilisation provision for large, deep landslide movements, used where the ground is unsuitable for cutting trenches or drainage wells and where it is impossible to work on the surface owing to a lack of space for the work machinery. Their effectiveness is due to the extensiveness of the area to be drained. Moreover, these drainage systems must be installed on the stable part of the slope. Drainage systems made up of microdrains are placed inside galleries with lengths that can reach 50‚Äì60 m. The sizes of the galleries are conditioned by the need to insert the drain perforation equipment. For this reason the minimum transversal internal size of the galleries vary from a minimum of 2 m, when using special reduced size equipment, to at least 3.5 m, when using traditional equipment.  Siphon drain  This is a technique conceived and developed in France, which works like the system of isolated drainage wells but overcoming the inconvenience of installing a pump for each well. Once motion is triggered in the siphon tube, without the entry of air into the loop, the flow of water is uninterrupted. For this reason, the two ends of the siphon tube are submerged in the water of two permanent storage tanks. This drain is created vertically starting from the campaign level but can also be sub-vertical or inclined. The diameter of the well can vary from 100 to 300 mm;. Inside a PVC pipe is placed or a perforated or microperforated steel pipe, filled with draining material. The siphon drain in this way carries off drainage water by gravity without the need for drainage pumps or pipes linking the bottom of each well. This system proves to be economically advantageous and relatively simple to set up, but requires a programme of controls and maintenance.  Microdrains  Microdrains is a simple to create drainage system with contained costs. They consist of small diameter perforations, made from surface locations, in trenches, in wells or in galleries. The microdrains are set to work in a sub-horizontal or sub-vertical position, according to the type of application. Reinforcement measures Stabilisation of a hillside by increasing the mechanical strength of the unstable ground, can be achieved in two ways: * Insertion of reinforcement elements into the ground * The improvement of the mechanical characteristics of the ground through chemical, thermal, or mechanical treatment. =Insertion of reinforcement elements into the ground= Types of mechanical reinforcement include: * Large diameter wells supported by one or more crowns of consolidated and possibly reinforced earth columns * Anchors * Networks of micropiles * Soil nailing * Geogrids for reinforced ground * Cellular faces Large diameter wells To guarantee slope stability it may be necessary to insert very rigid, strong elements. These elements are large diameter full section or ring section reinforced concrete wells with circular or elliptical cross-sections. The depth of the static wells can reach 30-40m. Often the static stabilising action of the wells is integrated with a series of microdrains laid out radially on several levels, reducing pore- pressures. Anchors Stabilisation using anchors Stabilising an unstable slope also can be achieved by the application of active forces to the unstable ground. These forces increase the normal stress and therefore resistance to friction along the creeping surface. Anchors can be applied for this purpose, linked at the surface to each other by a beam frame, which is generally made of reinforced concrete. The anchors are fixed in a place known to be stable. They are usually installed with orthogonal axes to the slope surface and therefore, at first, approximately orthogonal to the surface of the creep. Sometimes anchorage problems occur, as in the case of silty-clayey ground. Where there is water or the anchors are embedded in a clayey sub- layer, the adherence of the anchor to the ground must be confirmed. The surface contained within the grid of the beam frame should also be protected, using geofabrics, in order to prevent erosion from removing the ground underlying the beam frame. Networks of micropiles This solution requires the installation of a series of micropiles that make up a three- dimensional grid, variably tilted and linked at the head by a rigid reinforced concrete mortise. This structure constitutes a reinforcement for the ground, inducing an intrinsic improvement of the ground characteristics incorporated in the micropiles. This type of measure is used in cases of smaller landslides. The effectiveness of micropiles is linked to the insertion of micropiles over the entire landslide area. In the case of rotational landslides in soft clay, the piles contribute to increasing the resisting moment by friction on the upper part of the pile shaft found in the landslide. In the case of suspended piles, strength is governed by the part of the pile offering the least resistance. In practice, those piles in the most unstable area of the slope are positioned first, in order to reduce any possible lateral ground displacements. Preliminary design methods for the micropiles, are entrusted to computer codes that carry out numerical simulations, but which are subject to simplifications in the models that necessitate characterizations of rather precise potential landslide material. Nailing The soil nailing technique applied to temporarily and/or permanently stabilise natural slopes and artificial scarps is based on a fundamental principle in construction engineering: mobilizing the intrinsic mechanical characteristics of the ground, such as cohesion and the angle of internal friction, so that the ground actively collaborates with the stabilisation work. Nailing, on a par with anchors, induces normal stress, thereby increasing friction and stability within the hillside. One nailing method is rapid response diffuse nailing: CLOUJET, where the nails are embedded in the ground by means of an expanded bulb obtained by means of injecting mortar at high pressure into the anchorage area. Drainage is important to the CLOUJET method since the hydraulic regime, considered in the form of pore-pressure applied normally to the fractured surfaces, directly influences the characteristics of the system. The drained water, both through fabric and by means of pipes embedded in the ground, flows together at the foot of the slope in a collector installed parallel to the direction of the face. Another nailing system is the soil nail and root technology (SNART). Here, steel nails are inserted very rapidly into a slope by percussion, vibration or screw methods. Grid spacing is typically 0.8 to 1.5 m, nails are 25 to 50 mm in diameter and may be as long as 20 m. Nails are installed perpendicular to and through the failure plane, and are designed to resist bending and shear (rather than tension) using geotechnical engineering principles. Potential failure surfaces less than 2 m deep normally require the nails to be wider near the top, which may be achieved with steel plates fastened at the nail heads. Plant roots often form an effective and aesthetic facing to prevent soil loss between the nails. Geogrids typical geogrid solution Geogrids are synthetic materials used to reinforce the ground. The insertion of geosynthetic reinforcements (generally in the direction in which the deformation has developed) has the function of conferring greater stiffness and stability upon the ground, increasing its capacity to be subjected to greater deformations without fracturing. Cellular faces Cellular faces, also known by the name of \\"crib faces\\" are special supporting walls made of head grids prefabricated in reinforced concrete or wood (treated with preservatives). The heads have a length of about 1‚Äì2 m and the wall can reach 5 m in height. Compacted granular material is inserted in the spaces of the grid. The modularity of the system confers notable flexibility of use, both in terms of adaptability to the ground morphology, and because the structure does not require a deep foundation other than a laying plane of lean concrete used to make the support plane of the whole structure regular. Vegetation may be planted in the grid spaces, camouflaging of the structure. Chemical, thermal and mechanical treatments A variety of treatments may be used to improve the mechanical characteristics of the soil volume affected by landslides. Among these treatments, the technique of jet-grouting is often used, often as a substitute for and/or complement to previously discussed structural measures. The phases of jet-grouting work are: * Perforation phase: insertion, with perforation destroying the nucleus, of a set of poles into the ground up to the depth of treatment required by the project. * Extraction and programmed injection phase: injection of the mixture at very high pressure is done during the extraction phase of the set of poles. It is in this phase that through the insistence of the jet in a certain direction for a certain interval of time, the effect is obtained by the speed of extraction and rotation of the set of poles, so that volumes of ground can be treated in the shape and size desired. jet-grouting device (see ) The high energy jet produces a mixture of the ground and a continuous and systematic \\"claquage\\" with only a local effect within the radius of action without provoking deformations at the surface that could induce negative consequences on the stability of adjacent constructions. The projection of the mixture at high speed through the nozzles, using the effect of the elevated energy in play, allows the modification of the natural disposition and mechanical characteristics of the ground in the desired direction and in accordance with the mixture used (cement, bentonite, water, chemical, mixtures etc.). Depending on the characteristics of the natural ground, the type of mixture used, and work parameters, compression strength from 1 to 500 kgf/cm¬≤ (100 kPa to 50 MPa) can be obtained in the treated area. The realisation of massive consolidated ground elements of various shapes and sizes (buttresses and spurs) within the mass to be stabilised, is achieved by acting opportunely on the injection parameters. In this way the following can be obtained: thin diaphragms, horizontal and vertical cylinders of various diameter and generally any geometrical shapes. Another method for improving the mechanical characteristics of the ground is thermal treatment of potentially unstable hillsides made up of clayey materials. Historically, unstable clayey slopes along railways were hardened by lighting of wood or coal fires within holes dug into the slope. In large diameter holes (from 200 to 400 mm.), about 0.8-1.2m. apart and horizontally interconnected, burners were introduced to form cylinders of hardened clay. The temperatures reached were around 800 ¬∞C. These clay cylinders worked like piles giving greater shear strength to the creep surface. This system was useful for surface creep, as in the case of an embankment. In other cases the depth of the holes or the amount of fuel necessary led to either the exclusion of this technique or made the effort ineffective. Other stabilisation attempts were made by using electro-osmotic treatment of the ground. This type of treatment is applicable only in clayey grounds. It consists of subjecting the material to the action of a continuous electrical field, introducing pairs of electrodes embedded in the ground. These electrodes, when current is introduced cause the migration of the ion charges in the clay. Therefore, the inter-pore waters are collected in the cathode areas and they are dragged by the ion charges. In this way a reduction in water content is achieved. Moreover, by suitable choice of anodic electrode a structural transformation of the clay can be induced due to the ions freed by the anode triggering a series of chemo-physical reactions improving the mechanical characteristics of the unstable ground. This stabilisation method, however, is effective only in homogeneous clayey grounds. This condition is hard to find in unstable slopes, therefore electro- osmotic treatment, after some applications, has been abandoned.

He is known for having created the \\"Tulard files,\\" which censused Jews in Vichy France. Tulard was head of the Service of Foreigners and Jewish Affairs at the Prefecture of Police of Paris. Although Tullard was an active collaborator with the Germans he received no punishment after the war, and even retained his title as Chevalier (Knight) of the L√©gion d'Honneur. The Tulard files (fichier Tulard) Tulard created the first files, censusing members of the French Communist Party (PCF), for the Prefecture of Police under the Third Republic (1871‚Äì1940). He created another one, under Vichy, which listed Jews. These files were then handed over to Theodor Dannecker, head of the Gestapo in Paris. Following a Nazi ordinance dated 21 September 1940, which forced Jews in the \\"occupied zone\\" to declare themselves as such in police office or sub-prefectures (sous-pr√©fectures), Vichy promulgated on 3 October 1940 the first Jewish Status. In the sole department of the Seine, encompassing Paris and its immediate suburbs, nearly 150,000 persons presented themselves to the police offices. The registrations were then centralized by the French police, who created, under the direction of inspector Tulard, a central filing system.

He played Gaelic football with his local club Austin Stack's and was a member of the Kerry senior inter-county team from 1923 until 1933. Barrett captained Kerry to the All-Ireland titles of 1929 and 1932. Biography Joe Barrett was born at 67 Rock Street, Tralee in 1902. The third of five sons and six daughters, his father, John Barrett (1858‚Äì1915), was a well known pig and cattle dealer while his mother, Nora O‚ÄôMahony, hailed from Ballyduff. The influences in his family home were strongly Roman Catholic and nationalist. It were these views that shaped his outlook in his adulthood. Barrett received a brief national school education, however, in 1915 he followed his older brother, Christy, into the family business. World War I was raging at the time and the export of bacon and other meats created a huge demand which kept the Barrett's gainfully employed through their agency for the two local bacon factories. Tragedy was to strike the family again two years later when the eldest brother, Christy, died at the age of 30 after contracting pneumonia during the great flu epidemic. The onus then fell on Joe and his fourteen-year-old brother Jimmy to hold the business together, however, in spite of the economic realities of the time the Barrett's survived. At the age of fifteen Barrett joined the Irish Volunteers, a revolutionary organisation that hoped to established independence for Ireland. He remained active during the War of Independence. He took the republican side in the subsequent Civil War that followed the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Barrett was arrested in September 1922 and suffered much hardship during his imprisonment. While in prisoned he embarked on a 22-day hunger strike which undoubtedly affected his health in later life. Upon his release Barrett and his siblings set about rebuilding their business. It proved difficult at a time when political tensions divided friends and neighbours and boycotts of certain shops and businesses were regular occurrences. In 1935 Barrett married Kitty Barrett (1912‚Äì2009) from Fenit and together they had four children. John, the eldest of the family, was a noted sports journalist with the Kerryman, the Irish Press and the Irish Post before his untimely death in 1995. Tim, who died in a motor accident at the age of 35, captained the Kerry minors in the 1954 All-Ireland final. He was also a high-ranking trade union official in Dublin. A third son, Jo Jo Barrett, is a well known journalist and author who lives in Bray. He won under-21 and senior All-Ireland medals with Kerry in the 1960s. At the age of forty-five Barrett's health started to decline. He died on 2 June 1952, just a month short of his fiftieth birthday. Long after his death Barrett's son, Joe Joe, wrote In the name of the Game, a book about how his father and other footballers such as John Joe Sheehy and Con Brosnan were joined by their love of Gaelic football but took opposite sides in the Civil War. In 2007 he was enraged when it was announced that God Save the Queen would be played at Croke Park due to Ireland's rugby international with England. Barrett withdrew his father's medal collection from the adjoining GAA museum in protest. Playing career=Club Barrett played his club football and hurling with the famous Austin Stack's team in the 1920s and 1930s and enjoyed much success. Before 1928 the club had never won a county title in either code of Gaelic games, however, through Barrett's inspired leadership that was about to change. The county football decider saw Austin Stack's take on Kerins O'Rahilly's with Barrett lining out as captain of his team. Goals at key times won the games for the Tralee-based club and a 3‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì7 victory gave Barrett and his club a first- ever county senior football championship title. That same year Barrett captained the Austin Stack's hurling team in the county championship decider. A local Tralee derby ensued as nearby neighbours John Mitchels provided the opposition. They proved no match on the day as Austin Stack's easily won the game by 4‚Äì2 to 0‚Äì2. It was a first county senior hurling championship winners' medal for Barrett. In 1929 Austin Stack's reached a second consecutive county final in both codes. While the club surrendered their football crown to John Mitchels, the hurling championship decider saw more success coming Barrett's way. Another rout took place as John Mitchels were defeated for the second year in-a-row by a score line of 5‚Äì2 to 0‚Äì6. 1930 saw Austin Stack's line out in a third consecutive county football final. Kerins O'Rahill's were the opponents and an exciting game developed between these two great rivals. Austin Stack's goal-scoring abilities proved decisive again as Barrett's side collected a second title in three years on a score line of 4‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì5. In 1931, Barrett was again captain of the Austin Stack's hurling and football teams and guided both sides to their respective county finals. In the football decider fierce local rivals John Mitchels provided the opposition in a bid to stop the march of Barrett's side. The game was a close affair but two key goals for Austin Stack's sealed a 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì3 victory and a third county football title for Barrett. That year Austin Stack's lined out in the county hurling decider. Kilflynn provided the opposition and an incredibly high- scoring game developed. Fifteen goals were scored in total, however, an 8‚Äì2 to 7‚Äì3 score line gave Austin Stack's a two-point win and gave Barrett a third county hurling championship winners' medal. Austin Stack's continued their dominance of Gaelic games in Kerry again in 1932. A fifth consecutive county football championship final appearance beckoned with divisional side North Kerry providing the opposition. A close encounter was the order of the day with Barrett's side fighting tooth-and-nail to gain the upper-hand. After a thrilling sixty minutes Austin Stack's were the champions by 2‚Äì3 to 1‚Äì5 and Barrett added a fourth county winners' medal to his collection inside of five years. It was his fourth time captaining his club to the county football title. Four county football titles in-a-row was beyond this great team, however, Austin Stack's lined out in the county hurling decider again in 1933. Causeway were the opponents, however, Barrett captained his side to a fourth county final victory since 1928. After a few years out of the limelight Austin Stack's fought back to reach the county football decider of 1936. It was the last kick of the great team that had dominated football in 'the Kingdom' for much of the previous decade. Kerins O'Rahilly's were the opponents and a low- scoring and close game developed. At the long whistle a 0‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì4 score line gave Austin Stack's the win and gave Barrett a fifth county football winners' medal. Inter-county Barrett first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry senior football team in the early 1920s. It was a time when Kerry was still a divided county following the horrors of the Civil War. Many people believed that some of the Kerry players would never line out together again due to their respective allegiances during the revolutionary period, however, football proved to be a healing force for the people of 'the Kingdom'. After the fighting, Irish Free State army captain Con Brosnan managed to get safe passage guarantees for Republican players like John Joe Sheehy and Barrett to play games, and together they used football to help overcome the bitterness. In 1923 Kerry won the Munster title. While Barrett played no part in that game he was included in the starting fifteen for Kerry's subsequent All-Ireland final against Dublin. Kerry started well with Con Brosnan scoring a goal from fifty yards out to help his side to a 1‚Äì2 to 0‚Äì1 lead at half-time. John Joe Sheehy scored a point, Kerry's only score in the second-half, as 'the Dubs' took control. P. J. Kirwan scored Dublin's second-half goal while Paddy McDonnell, Jack Murphy and Joe Stynes chipped in with a point each to halt Kerry's march. A 1‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì3 score line gave Dublin the title and resulted in defeat for Barrett and Kerry. In 1924 Barrett lined out in his first Munster final Clare provided the opposition on that occasion and an absolute rout ensued. Clare proved no match for 'the Kingdom', who won the provincial decider by 5‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì2. It was Barrett's first Munster winners' medal on the field of play. Kerry later qualified for a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Dublin, the team that had put Barrett's side to the sword in the previous year's final, provided the opposition again. A close game developed with neither side taking a decisive lead. In the dying moments of the game John Baily had a goal disallowed for Kerry, however, Con Brosnan popped up to clinch the winning point.The GAA Book of Lists pp. 385‚Äì386 A 0‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì3 score line gave Kerry the title and gave Barrett his first All-Ireland winners' medal. In 1925 Kerry faced Clare in the provincial decider once again. While Clare were completely outclassed the previous year, the 1925 Munster final proved to be a massacre. A 5‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì0 score line gave Kerry the win and gave Barrett a second Munster winners' medal.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 140 Kerry later defeated Cavan in the All-Ireland semi-final, however, there would be no All-Ireland final appearance for 'the Kingdom'. Both Cavan and Kerry were disqualified from the championship over a new county of residence 'declaration' rule.The GAA Book of Lists p. 386 The provincial series posed little difficulty for Kerry again in 1926. An 0‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì4 defeat of Tipperary gave Barrett a third consecutive Munster winners' medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Kerry take on Kildare and a close game developed. The All-Ireland title looked to be heading to Kildare, however, Bill Gorman scored a 59th-minute equaliser for Kerry to force a draw. The replay was sad affair as Kerry's Jack Murphy died of pneumonia between the drawn encounter and the second game. Another close game was the order of the day, however, Tom O'Mahoney was the hero of the day. His second-half goal proved to be a match-winner as Kildare hit the woodwork three times. A 1‚Äì4 to 0‚Äì4 score line gave Kerry the win and gave Barrett a second All-Ireland winners' medal. In 1927 Kerry faced Clare in the Munster final for the third time in four years. The result was similar to the two previous occasions as 'the Kingdom' emerged victorious by 4‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì3. It was Barrett's fourth Munster winners' medal. For the second year in-a-row Kerry and Kildare did battle in the championship decider. Kerry raced into a three-point lead early in the opening half, however, that seemed to be their lot for the day. Kildare bounced back with a succession of points to give them a 0‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì3 lead. With five minutes to go John Joe Sheehy breached the Kildare defence, however, his shot at goal hit the post. The scores remained the same for the last few minutes and Barrett's side were defeated.The GAA Book of Lists p. 387 In 1928 Kerry dominated the newly created National Football League. Kildare, the other outstanding team of the era, provided the opposition in the final. A 2‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì6 sealed the victory for Kerry and a first National League medal for Barrett.Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 176 Kerry failed to retain the Munster crown for a sixth consecutive occasion late that year, however, the team bounced back the following year with Barrett serving as captain for the year. The National League final saw Kerry take on Kildare again. A narrow 1‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì3 score line gave Barrett's team a second consecutive title in football's secondary competition. In the subsequent Munster championship a 1‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì2 trouncing of old rivals Clare gave Kerry the title again and gave Barrett a fifth provincial winners' medal. The All-Ireland final that year pitted Kerry against reigning champions Kildare for the third time in four years. Ned Sweeney's first-half goal gave Kerry a lift and was enough to survive a great comeback by Kildare. John Joe Sheehy and Paul Doyle scored five points each from frees while Paddy Martin landed a 30-yard drop-kick into the net for Kildare's only goal of the day. It was not enough, however, as Kerry won the game by 1‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì5. With that Barrett collected a third All-Ireland winners' medal, while he also became the first Kerry man to lift the Sam Maguire Cup. In 1930 this Kerry team were beginning to carve out a reputation as one of the best to ever represent the county. The Munster final saw Tipperary provide the opposition, however, a 3‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì2 score line gave Kerry the win. It was a sixth Munster title for Barrett. Kerry reached the All-Ireland final again, this time with Monaghan providing the opposition. Peter McConnon opened the scoring for Monaghan, however, Kerry dominated the rest of the game. John Joe Landers, Ned Sweeny and John Joe Sheehy scored three goals for Kerry while Monaghan could only manage one other point. A huge 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì2 score line gave Kerry the title and gave Barrett a fourth All-Ireland winners' medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 388 In 1931 Barrett was in line for the Kerry captaincy again, however, he gave the captaincy to Con Brosnan in recognition of the latter's magnificent contribution to Kerry both on the football field and off. It was another move to heal the scars of the Civil War tensions. That year's Munster final saw Kerry line out against Tipperary. Another rout ensued as a 5‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì2 score line gave Kerry the title and gave Barrett an impressive seventh Munster title. Kildare hoped to stop a Kerry three-in-a-row in the subsequent All-Ireland final and gave a good account of themselves. The Leinster men took a 0‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì4 lead at half-time, however, a series of positional switches saw Kerry lead by 0‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì7 coming into the final stage of the game. A mix-up between the Kildare goalkeeper and full-back saw Kerry score the only goal of the contest. This took the win out of Kildare's sails as 'the Kingdom' went on to secure athird consecutive title with a 1‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì8 score line. It was Barrett's fifth All-Ireland winners' medal. In 1932 Barrett took over the captaincy of the Kerry team for the second time. It was an historic year as Kerry were going for four-in-a-row, a feat only ever achieved by Wexford. The Munster series of games proved no obstacle for 'the Kingdom'. A 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì4 defeat of Tipperary gave Barrett an eighth provincial winners' medal. The All-Ireland final had a new twist to it as Mayo provided the opposition. In a similar pattern to the previous year, Kerry trailed at half- time, however, Bill Landers scored a quick goal straight after the interval. Mayo could only muster one goal in the second period of play as Kerry triumphed by 2‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì4. It was a sixth All-Ireland medal for Barrett, while he also lifted the Sam Maguire Cup for the second time. In 1933 Kerry set out to make history by becoming the first team to achieve five consecutive All- Ireland titles. All went to plan as Kerry defeated Tipperary by 2‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì4 to take the Munster title again. It was Barrett's ninth provincial winners' medal. Kerry's dream of creating history came to an abrupt end in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final as eventual champions Cavan defeated Barrett's side by 1‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì5. This was his last appearance with Kerry as he retired from inter-county football following this defeat.

They are on the site of the old Rushy Park coal mine, the first mine to use the revolutionary Anderton Shearer Loader.healeyhero.co.uk The slag heaps were created by the dumping of toxic chemical waste from the manufacture of glass by the town's Pilkington company. The exact composition of the slag heaps is unknown, but a land studythisischeshire.co.uk showed it to contain various poisonous elements such as arsenic, lead and cadmium. Technically the land is private property belonging to Pilkington, but the public have access and regularly use it for various activities. The exact age of the Burgies is unknown, however it is understood that the second heap is actually the oldest. This older one is sometimes referred to as \\"the dry Burgies\\" and the newer as \\"the wet Burgies\\". These terms are used by older residents who remember their construction, as the first one is a drier waste with the second one being a thick liquid. This liquid was pumped through a pipe from Pilkington's across the second to the site of the first. Boards were erected as moulds to hold the liquid until it dried and then moulds were built on top of these to allow more liquid to be placed on top.  Origin of Name  It has been suggested that the name came from a thick brown liquid oozing from the slag heaps shortly after the waste had been dumped that resembled Burgoo - a kind of porridge eaten in the 17th century by sailors. It is speculated that an ex-sailor may have noticed the resemblance and corrupted the word to \\"Burgy\\".thisislancashire.co.uk The red mud present on top of the Burgies is also occasionally referred to as Burgoo, due to its viscous appearance.  Physical Appearance  The first Burgy is approximately and the second is approximately . On the north side of the first Burgy there is a small lake (which is actually flood water over a horses field) near the meeting of Hinckley Road, Laffak Road and Chain lane, often referred to as the \\"Burgy Pond\\", surrounded by an area of flat land referred to as the \\"Corn Field\\" due to the long grass which grows here. The Burgies are characterised by very steep sides on all sides of both heaps except for a path on the north side of the first heap, which has a shallower gradient, allowing for access. The tops of each are, for the most part, uniformly flat. The waste has been capped with around 1.5 metres of top soil and possibly clay beneath this but, at parts, there is exposed soil which has a red colour to it and has been given the name \\"Burgy Mud\\". This red colouring is one of the main characteristics of the Burgies. Although it has been capped, there is still a lot of run off of an unknown composition probably due to water soaking in and absorbing the chemicals within and then seeping out at the bottom.  Wildlife  Although it is a chemical dumping ground, the top soil placed on the top has allowed the whole of the first Burgy to be covered in woodland and grass with the second smaller one mostly covered in tall grass and small parts of woodland. This, as expected, has allowed populations of various mammals and birds to thrive . One notable example of a thriving population is the one of the wild rabbit. There have also been reports of magic mushrooms, such as the liberty cap, growing on the Burgies. This environment has provided a pleasant woodland area for the local people and is a favourite dog walking area.  Burgie sports and activities  The Burgies are very popular with people who own off- road motorcycles and BMX bikes. There are many tracks, on both Burgies, that have been built by off-road motorcycle racers to race their bikes. A notable site on the first Burgies is \\"The Jumps\\". This is a series of bike ramps and jumps built using logs and sand. Other notable sports include Burgy Surfing and Extreme Burgy Climbing. These are usually done on the second Burgies. Burgy Surfing involves surfing down the steep sides on various objects including sleds, boxes and car bonnets amongst other things. Extreme Burgy Climbing involves racing to the top of the steepest side, which is near vertical in parts. This is made very dangerous because the side is almost always slippery and the fact that most of the trees used to help climbing are dead and are easily uprooted resulting in very nasty falls. Death Sliding is one of the more popular activities and again is done on the second Burgies. This involves climbing to the top of the highest tree and tying a rope as high as can be tied. The other end of the rope is then anchored to the bottom of a tree some distance away, thus creating a death slide. Participants will then climb the tree with a crude sliding device, usually a V shaped stick, and place this over the rope enabling them to slide down the rope towards the ground at high speed like Snookerpool.  Burgy Action Group  There have been many plans to build houses on the site of the first Burgy by companies such as Barratt and more recently Woodford. However, concerns have been raised because construction on the land would require drilling into the core of the Burgies subsequently releasing dangerous chemicals into the atmosphere. The Burgy Action Group, a local action group made up of the people living close to the site, have successfully challenged the construction of homes on the land citing the dangerous nature of any chemicals released during construction.messengernewspapers.co.uk Another argument is the issue of wildlife. As of 2007 there are no other plans by other companies to build on the land.

He was drafted in the first round of the NBA draft after attending and playing basketball at Texas A&M; University. After retiring from basketball, Parker created the Sonny Parker Youth Foundation in Chicago to help inner-city students. Early years Parker was born in Chicago, Illinois and attended Chicago's Farragut High School, where he received All-City, All-State, and All-Public League honors. In appreciation of his efforts on the school's basketball team, he has been named to the Farragut Hall of Fame, the Chicago Public Schools Hall of Fame, and the Illinois High School Hall of Fame. After graduating from high school, Parker spent two years at Mineral Area College. In both of his seasons, Parker was named an All-American, as well as Conference Player of the Year and Region Player of the Year. He was an All- Conference and All-Region pick, and is the Mineral Area College's Leading Career Scorer. He has been inducted into the National Junior College Hall of Fame. The 1973 team won the conference championship. College career Although Parker was recruited by many of the top college basketball programs, he chose to attend Texas A&M; University, primarily to learn under legendary coach Shelby Metcalf. The lonely Parker, over 1000 miles from home, was quickly embraced by Metcalf and his family, often accompanying his coach on fishing trips. The men became close enough friends that after Parker was named the most valuable player in one of the many college tournaments in which A&M; participated, he gave his reward, a nice watch, to Metcalf as a gift. Metcalf treasured the watch for twenty-five years, before giving it to Parker's son Christian at the ceremony inducting Parker into the Texas A&M; Athletic Hall of Fame. At Metcalf's funeral in February 2007, Parker gave a eulogy and served as one of the pallbearers. In his two years at Texas A&M;, Parker led the Aggies to back-to-back Southwest Conference titles, earning himself first- team All-Southwest Conference honors both years as well. The team reached the NCAA Tournament in 1974-1975. As a senior, Parker averaged 20.7 points per game, a feat that only two other Aggie players have achieved in the 20 years since he left.

For 29 years, Parker held the record as the highest an Aggie had ever been drafted, until in 2005 Antoine Wright was chosen as the 15th overall draft pick by the New Jersey Nets. In his rookie season, Parker played in 65 games, scoring a total of 379 points (5.8 points per game), with 2.7 rebounds per game and .9 assists per game. His team reached the playoffs, with Parker contributing 4.2 points per game and 2.8 rebounds, and .9 assists per game. The following season, Parker played in 82 games, averaging 11.4 points per game, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.9 assists. He ranked 16th in the NBA for Field Goal Percentage, with .519 field goals (406 out of 783). His best season, however, came in 1978-1979, where he averaged 15.2 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game, with 144 steals and 33 blocks. In a thrilling game in November 1981, Parker led the Warriors to a 102-100 victory over the Houston Rockets. At the opening of the final quarter, the Warriors trailed by 10 points before Parker and teammate Joe Hassett combined to score 13 points and give the Warriors their first lead with 3 minutes left to play. The game was tied at 100 when Parker rebounded a shot by his teammate Lloyd Free with two seconds remaining and completed a reverse layup to give the Warriors their victory. After a disappointing 1981-82 season, where Parker averaged only 3.9 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game, in September 1982 the Warriors waived Parker, ending his NBA career. For the six years that he played professional basketball, Parker averaged 9.9 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game. Youth Foundation In 1990, Parker established the non- profit Sonny Parker Youth Foundation (SPYF) in his hometown of Chicago. The foundation is designed to provide year-round educational, recreational, and multi-cultural programs for inner-city children from kindergarten through 12th grade. Through after-school and weekend programs, the foundation provides tutoring, ACT/SAT preparation, parents' workshops, job training, mentoring, career planning, and physical education in the hopes of improving the reading and writing skills of the students and preparing them to become more productive citizens. Parker is the president of the organization and is active in its daily activities. Personal life Parker and his wife, Lola, have seven children. Parker's son Christian played at BYU-Hawaii before serving an LDS mission in Atlanta, Georgia; upon return he finished his career at the College of Southern Idaho. He then enrolled at the University of Washington; he aspires to become a collegiate basketball coach. Parker's eldest son, Darryl, is a graduate of the University of Oregon and played professional basketball overseas. He is now a Chicago police officer. Parker's son Jabari is a former Duke basketball player who was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the 2nd pick in the 2014 NBA draft. Sonny was afflicted with kidney problems that require dialysis, making it difficult for him to attend Jabari's games.

The operation was established in the late 1940s by Paul Mellon (1907‚Äì1999) who won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder in 1971 and again in 1986. Under Mellon the stable had more than 1,000 stakes race winners with total earnings in excess of US$30 million. Steeplechase racing Rokeby Stables' American Way was the 1948 American Steeplechase Champion and in 1990 Molotov won the American Grand National steeplechase. Flat racing Among its many successful horses, the stable owned the good runner Winter's Tale, Kentucky Derby winner, Sea Hero and the European champions, Mill Reef, Glint of Gold, and Gold and Ivory. Mill Reef's wins include The Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Glint of Gold, a son of Mill Reef, won six European Group One races including the 1981 Derby Italiano, Grand Prix de Paris and Preis von Europa. Paul Mellon is one of only four men to have raced both a Kentucky Derby winner and an Epsom Derby winner. The others are John W. Galbreath, Michael Tabor and Prince Ahmed bin Salman. Mellon, however, is the only one to ever win the Kentucky Derby, Epsom Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In England, Mellon kept his horses at trainer Ian Balding's Park House Stables at Kingsclere and raced under his own name. In the United States, Rokeby Stables employed a number of prominent horse trainers including Hall of Fame inductee Elliott Burch who trained the stable's champions Arts and Letters, Quadrangle, Fort Marcy, Run the Gantlet, and Key to the Mint. Another Hall of Fame inductee, Mack Miller, took over as the Rokeby trainer in 1977. Miller's accomplishments include winning the Kentucky Derby with Sea Hero and the New York Handicap Triple in 1984 with Fit To Fight. Once Miller retired from training, in 1997, the then 90-year-old Paul Mellon decided to give up racing but still maintained his breeding operations.

At the time of the Hanoverian Succession in 1714 he was a Hanoverian Tory, but later offered support to the Jacobites. Early life and family Bunbury was the son of Sir Henry Bunbury, 2nd Baronet and his wife Mary Eyton, daughter of Sir Kenrick Eyton. In 1687, aged only eleven, he succeeded his father as baronet.

The plot concerns the dilapidation of a once grand Irish hotel (the Majestic), in the midst of the political upheaval during the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1921). It is the first instalment in Farrell's acclaimed 'Empire Trilogy', preceding The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip. Although there are similar themes within the three novels (most notably that of the British Empire), they do not form a sequence of storytelling. Troubles was well-received upon its publication. It won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize and, later, the Lost Man Booker Prize. It was adapted into a made-for-television film in 1988, starring Ian Charleson and Ian Richardson. In 2010, Sam Jordison in The Guardian called Troubles \\"a work of genius\\", and \\"one of the best books\\" of the second half of the twentieth century. \\"Had [Farrell] not sadly died so young,‚Äù Salman Rushdie said in 2008, \\"there is no question that he would today be one of the really major novelists of the English language. The three novels that he did leave are all in their different way extraordinary.\\" Plot summary 1919: After surviving the Great War, Major Brendan Archer makes his way to Ireland, hoping to discover whether he is indeed betrothed to Angela Spencer, whose Anglo- Irish family owns the once-aptly-named Majestic Hotel in Kilnalough. But his fianc√©e is strangely altered and her family‚Äôs fortunes have suffered a spectacular decline. The hotel‚Äôs hundreds of rooms are disintegrating on a grand scale; its few remaining guests thrive on rumours and games of whist; herds of cats have taken over the Imperial Bar and the upper stories; bamboo shoots threaten the foundations; and piglets frolic in the squash court. Meanwhile, the Major is captivated by the beautiful and bitter Sarah Devlin. As housekeeping disasters force him from room to room, outside the order of the British Empire also totters: there is unrest in the East, and in Ireland itself the mounting violence of ‚Äúthe troubles.‚Äù https://www.nyrb.com/products/troubles?variant=1094932909 The novel concerns the arrival of the English Major Archer, recently discharged from the British Army, at the Majestic Hotel on the Wexford coast in south-east Ireland in 1919. Both the hotel, and the town in which it is situated, Kilnalough, are fictional. Archer is convinced he is engaged, though sure he had never actually proposed, to Angela Spencer, the daughter of Edward Spencer, the owner of the hotel. She has written to him since they met in 1916 while on leave from the trench warfare of the Western Front. The Spencers are an Anglo- Irish Protestant family, strongly Unionist in their attitudes towards Ireland's ties to the United Kingdom. Archer functions as a confused observer of the dysfunctional Spencer family, representing the Anglo-Irish, and the local Catholic population. As the novel progresses, social and economic relationships break down, mirrored by the gentle decay of the hotel. Characters * Major Brendan Archer ‚Äì ex-Army Officer and fianc√© of Angela Spencer. Archer also appears in Farrell's later novel The Singapore Grip. * Edward Spencer ‚Äì owner of the Majestic hotel, his mental decline echoes the physical decline of the hotel itself and also the violence in Ireland. * Angela Spencer ‚Äì daughter of Edward Spencer. * Sarah Devlin ‚Äì a young woman the Major meets early in the novel and becomes increasingly obsessed with after Angela's death. Apparently disabled in the early parts of the novel. * Charity and Faith Spencer ‚Äì younger twin daughters of Edward Spencer. Girls at the start of the novel, they develop into young women and are often depicted as wilful and naive. * Ripon Spencer ‚Äì Edward Spencer's adult son. Other characters include: * The old ladies staying at the hotel. * Various servants of the hotel, including the elderly 'Murphy' and Se√°n Murphy, a somewhat suspect young groundsman. * The inhabitants of Kilnalough, the village near to the hotel, including Sarah's father, a doctor, a priest and others. Analysis Farrell develops the insulated environment of the run-down hotel as a reflection on the attitudes of the historically privileged Anglo-Irish, in denial of the violent insurgency of the overwhelming majority (Nationalists/Republicans). While the Irish War of Independence forms the background to the events of the novel, the political upheaval is not treated as a theme. Apart from occasional news reports concerning the war, the only references to it are chance remarks from the novel's characters. The novel's action takes place mostly within the hotel, with the remainder of the scenes taking place almost entirely in the surrounding areas. As a result, the only characters given a major airing are the Major and the Spencer family, which adds to the claustrophobic, unreal mood of the novel. Reviews William Trevor said in The Guardian on 10 October 1970, that the novel was a \\"clever book\\" and \\"a tour de force of considerable quality.\\" Vivian Mercier wrote in The Nation on 8 November 1971 that Farrell was \\"a born story-teller\\".

She is the founder-director of the Nalanda Dance Research Centre and the founder-principal of the Nalanda Nritya Kala Mahavidyalaya in Mumbai.  Early life and education  Born in Gujarat, Dr. Rele spent a part of her childhood in Santiniketan and in Kolkata with her uncle. At Santiniketan she had the opportunity to watch Kathakali and Mohiniattam performances which she claims helped shape her artistic sensibilities. She is qualified lawyer with an LLB from the Government Law College, Mumbai and a diploma in international law from the University of Manchester. She also holds a PhD in dance from the University of Mumbai.  Mohiniyattam Artiste  Dr. Rele is also a Kathakali artiste having been trained under Guru \\"Panchali\\" Karunakara Panicker since the age of seven. Her initiation into Mohiniattam came much later under Kalamandalam Rajalakshmi. A grant from the Sangeet Natak Akademi and later the Ford Foundation helped her delve deeper into her interest in Mohinattam and during 1970‚Äì71 she traveled to Kerala filming exponents of the dance form such as Kunjukutty Amma, Chinnammu Amma and Kalyanikutty Amma. The project helped acquaint her with the nuances of Mohiniattam and record its traditional and technical styles while also enabling her to evolve a teaching methodology for it. Her study of these artistes and their technique against the backdrop of classical texts like Natyasastra, Hastalakshanadeepika and Balaramabharatam led her to develop her own style of Mohiniattam dubbed the 'Kanaka Rele School' of Mohinattam. Dr. Rele's concept of body kinetics in dance is a pioneering innovation that disaggregates body movements in Mohiniattam using a notation system. Dr. Rele is credited with having played a key role in the revival and popularisation of Mohiniattam and for having brought a scientific temper and academic rigour to it.  Notable Choreographies  Rele is noted for the contemporisation of mythological tales in her performances and her portrayal of strong women characters in them which is a marked departure from the traditional Mohinyattam theme of the nayika pining for love. Some of her notable subjects and choreographies include Kubja, Kalyani, Silappadikaram and Swapnavasavadattam. Rele's association with the Malayalam poet and scholar Kavalam Narayana Panicker led to her introduction to Sopana Sangeetham and creation of choreographic pieces set to Sopana Sangeetam's talas. Rele has credited Kavalam's compositions as being inspirational for several of her choreographies that \\"highlight the trauma of women in society based on women characters in mythology\\". \\"Nritya Bharati\\", a documentary on India's classical dances produced by her Nalanda school has been acquired by the Ministry of External Affairs as the official capsule for all Indian missions abroad. The Enlightened One ‚Äî Gautama Buddha which premiered in 2011 was a choreographic piece created against the backdrop of the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai.  Academic career  Rele was instrumental in beginning the Department of Fine Arts at the University of Mumbai and also served as its dean. Rele established the Nalanda Dance Research Centre in 1966 and the Nalanda Nritya Kala Mahavidyalay in 1972. The Nalanda Dance Research Centre, Mumbai which trains students for a university degree in Mohiniyattam is recognised as a research institute by the Ministry of Science and Technology. Rele has also served as an expert and advisor on dance to the Department of Culture of the Government of India and the Planning Commission and has been part of the University Grants Commission's curriculum development team and a consultant to Indian and foreign universities in developing academic dance courses.  Awards and honours  Rele was conferred the Gaurav Puraskar by the Government of Gujarat in 1989 and the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in the Republic of India, in 1990. Kanak Rele was honoured with the title 'Kala Vipanchee' by Vipanchee, a pioneering institution for Indian music and dance, in 2005. In 2006, the Government of Madhya Pradesh conferred the Kalidas Samman on her for her contributions to and excellence in the field of classical dance. She is also a recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and the M S Subbulakshmi Award. In 2013, she was conferred the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India.

It begins at PA 72 and ends at Exit 6 of Interstate 78 (I-78). PA 343 heads mostly through urbanized areas near Lebanon before continuing into rural areas further north. There is a concurrency with U.S. Route 22 (US 22) near the northern terminus. PA 343 has had a number of different realignments, most of them relating to the northern terminus of the highway. The highway originally terminated at an intersection with PA 443 in Lickdale, moved to end in the community of Bordnersville soon after. The highway was then extended along the local continuation to end at US 22 in Harper Tavern. In 1963, PA 343 was moved back to Lickdale, and seven years after, moved to its northern terminus, thirteen years after the construction of I-78.  Route description  PA 343 heading south from US 22 in Fredericksburg PA 343 begins at an intersection with PA 72, near the Northwest Elementary School, in the city of Lebanon in Lebanon County. PA 343 heads eastward along Maple Street, a two-lane undivided street maintained by the city, past urbanized homes and businesses. The route turns north onto North 7th Street and passes more development. PA 343 leaves Lebanon for North Lebanon Township, where it becomes state-maintained and passes through the residential community of Reindeldville. The road runs north-northeast past more homes and businesses as it heads through the community of Eustontown. The route leaves the urbanized areas and heads into agricultural areas with some trees and homes. PA 343 turns northwest at the Heffelfinger Road intersection and enters Bethel Township, where it heads north as South Pine Grove Street through a patch of woods before running through more farmland. The road runs to the west of Little Swatara Creek and passes to the east of Pine Meadows Golf Course before it crosses the creek. The route continues through rural areas and passes through the residential community of Shirksville. PA 343 heads north through more farmland before it comes to an intersection with US 22 (William Penn Highway) south of the community of Fredericksburg. At this point, South Pine Grove Street continues to Fredericksburg and PA 343 turns northeast to become concurrent with US 22 on four-lane divided William Penn Highway. The road runs through agricultural areas with some commercial development, passing to the south of a warehouse. PA 343 splits from US 22 by heading north on two-lane undivided Pine Grove Road, passing to the west of a park. The route continues near rural commercial development before it reaches its northern terminus at a partial interchange with I-78, with access to westbound I-78 and access from eastbound I-78. Past this interchange, Pine Grove Road continues north as SR 1007 toward the Berks County line.  History  PA 343 was assigned in the numbering of state routes in Pennsylvania during 1928. The highway then ran from the southern terminus in Lebanon, which was at the time, an intersection with US 22 (now US 422). At Fredericksburg, the route reached an intersection with PA 43 (now US 22). At Fredericksburg, highway turned to the northwest and headed to Lickdale. There it terminated at an intersection with PA 443. The highway stayed intact for two years, until 1930, when the highway was extended a few miles to the community of Bordnersville, where the road then continued as a local highway. The highway was paved from Fredericksburg to an intersection with Lancaster Street and from Lickdale to Bordnersville in 1932. In 1936, the Pennsylvania Department of Highways extended PA 343 past Bordnersville and Lickdale, along the local road. This changed the northern terminus to an intersection with US 22 (formerly the alignment of PA 43) in Harper Tavern. This alignment remained intact for more than two decades. In 1963, even with the construction of I-78 six years prior, PA 343 was realigned once again by the Department of Highways. This time, the northern terminus was cut back to the PA 72 intersection in Lickdale, with an extended PA 934 replacing the route between Harper Tavern and Lickdale. This change was made to provide the same route number on both sides of the I-81 interchange north of Harper Tavern. The highway remained intact for another seven years, and in 1970, PA 343 was realigned for the final time, this time onto its current alignment. The northern terminus is now at a partial interchange with I-78.

The landmark of this market is historic Allahabad Clock Tower, built in 1913, also known as Chowk Ghantaghar. History Chowk is a historical point, where once stood the Neem tree where numerous freedom fighters were hanged in the first Indian War of Independence. The old church is situated here. The Grand Trunk Road passed through Chowk in its early days. The area once had, residence of Pt Motilal Nehru and his son, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru was born in an area called Mir Ganj, which is now the notorious red light district of Allahabad.

Advertising research is a detailed study conducted to know how customers respond to a particular ad or advertising campaign. History The highlighted events of the history of advertising research include: 1879 - N. W. Ayer conducts custom research in an attempt to win the advertising business of Nichols-Shepard Co., a manufacturer of agricultural machinery.Honomichl p.173 1895 - Harlow Gale of the University of Minnesota mails questionnaires to gather opinions about advertising from the public. 1900s - George B. Waldron conducts qualitative research for Mahin‚Äôs Advertising Agency.Honomichl pp.173-174 1910s - 1911 can be considered the year marketing research becomes an industry. That year, J. George Frederick leaves his position as editor of Printer‚Äôs Ink to begin his research company, the Business Bourse with clients such as General Electric and the Texas Co. Also in 1911, Kellogg's ad manager, R. O. Eastman creates the Association of National Advertisers which is now known as the Association of National Advertising Managers. The group‚Äôs first project is a postcard questionnaire to determine magazine readership. The results introduce the concept of duplication of circulation. In 1916, R. O. Eastman starts his own company, the Eastman Research Bureau which boasts clients such as Cosmopolitan, Christian Herald, and General Electric.Honomichl p. 174 1920s - In 1922, Dr. Daniel Starch tests reader recognition levels of magazine and newspaper advertisements and editorial content. In 1923, Dr. George Gallup begins measuring advertising readership. 1930s - In 1936, Dr. George Gallup validates his survey methodology by using the same tools polling voters during public elections. This allows him to successfully compare and validate his study's results against the election‚Äôs results.Honomichl p.175 1940s - Post World War II, the U.S. sees a large increase in the number of market research companies. 1950s - Market researchers focus on improving methods and measures. In their search for a single-number statistic to capture the overall performance of the advertising creative, Day-After-Recall (DAR) is created.Young, p.6 1960s - Qualitative focus groups gain in popularity. In addition, some advertisers call for more rigorous measurement of the in-market effectiveness of advertising in order to provide better accountability for the large amounts being spent on advertising. In response, Seymour Smith and Associates, using Advertising Research Foundation data as a jumping-off point, develops the Communicus System, a comprehensive approach to isolating the in- market impact of advertising across media. 1970s - Computers emerge as business tools, allowing researchers to conduct large-scale data manipulations. (Honomichl p. 175) Multiple studies prove DAR (Recall) scores do not predict sales. The measure, persuasion, also known as motivation, is validated as a predictor of sales.Young, pp. 34‚Äì35 The measure known as ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù is re-examined by researchers who make a distinction between the attention-getting power of the creative execution (attention) and how well ‚Äúbranded‚Äù the ad is (brand linkage).Young, April 2005, p. 5 Herbert Krugman seeks to measure non-verbal measures biologically by tracking brain wave activities as respondents watch commercials.

Picture Sorts results are graphed to visually represent commercial viewers' moment-by-moment image recognition (Flow of Attention), positive and negative feelings (Flow of Emotion), and brand values (Flow of Meaning).Young, pp.21-26 Trends in in-market tracking include a greater focus on the multimedia nature of entire advertising campaigns. 2000s - Global advertisers seek an integrated marketing research system that will work worldwide so they can compare results across countries.Young, April 2005, pp. 127‚Äì135 For a look at trends predicted for advertising research in the 21st century, see Seven Trends for the Future. Dr. Robert Heath publishes the seminal and controversial monograph ‚ÄúThe Hidden Power of Advertising‚Äù which challenged the traditional models used in advertising research and shows how most advertising is processed at an emotional level (not a rational level). His monograph leads to re-examination of in-market research approaches that compare the behaviors of those who have seen advertising versus those who have not, such as the Communicus System, and the development of brand new pretesting systems such as the OTX AdCEP system.Heath, R.

Customized research is conducted for a specific client to address that client‚Äôs needs. Only that client has access to the results of the research. Syndicated research is a single research study conducted by a research company with its results available, for sale, to multiple companies.Marketing Research Association - Research Resources For the Consumer : Glossary of Marketing Research Terms Pre-market research can be conducted to optimize advertisements for any medium: radio, television, print (magazine, newspaper or direct mail), outdoor billboard (highway, bus, or train), or Internet. Different methods would be applied to gather the necessary data appropriately. Post-testing is conducted after the advertising, either a single ad or an entire multimedia campaign has been run in-market. The focus is on what the advertising has done for the brand, for example increasing brand awareness, trial, frequency of purchasing. Pre-testing Pre-testing, also known as copy testing, is a specialized field of marketing research that determines an ad‚Äôs effectiveness based on consumer responses, feedback, and behavior. Pre-testing is conducted before implementing the advertisement to customers. The following methods can be followed to pre-test an advertisement: * Focus group discussion * In-depth interview * Projective techniques * Checklist method * Consumer jury method * Sales area test * Questionnaire method * Recall test * Readability test * Eye movement test Campaign pre-testing A new area of pre-testing driven by the realization that what works on TV does not necessarily translate in other media. Greater budgets allocated to digital media in particular have driven the need for campaign pre-testing. The addition of a media planning tool to this testing approach allows advertisers to test the whole campaign, creative and media, and measures the synergies expected with an integrated campaign.Research's Missing Link, Mediaweek, September 23, 2008 Post- testing Post-testing/Tracking studies provide either periodic or continuous in-market research monitoring a brand‚Äôs performance, including brand awareness, brand preference, product usage and attitudes. Some post-testing approaches simply track changes over time, while others use various methods to quantify the specific changes produced by advertising‚Äîeither the campaign as a whole or by the different media utilized. Overall, advertisers use post- testing to plan future advertising campaigns, so the approaches that provide the most detailed information on the accomplishments of the campaign are most valued. The two types of campaign post-testing that have achieved the greatest use among major advertisers include continuous tracking, in which changes in advertising spending are correlated with changes in brand awareness, and longitudinal studies, in which the same group of respondents are tracked over time. With the longitudinal approach, it is possible to go beyond brand awareness, and to isolate the campaign's impact on specific behavioral and perceptual dimensions, and to isolate campaign impact by media.Thorson & Moore, 135-152 Terminology *Adcept *Advertising *Awareness *Brand preference *Shockvertising See also=Advertising research methods *Ad tracking *AttentionTracking *Copy testing NotesFurther reading * Banks, Ivana Bu≈°ljeta, Patrick De Pelsmacker, and Shintaro Okazaki, eds.

NewsRadio 1620 began simulcasting on FM 92.3 in Pensacola during November 2016. The station is owned by ADX Communications of Escambia. Programming WNRP broadcasts a news/talk radio format to the greater Pensacola, Florida, area. The station features news every half-hour from Fox News Radio along with local news. Notable syndicated hosts include Brian Kilmeade, Dave Ramsey, and Lars Larson. WNRP also carries live sports including Florida State University football and basketball, The station previously aired the games of the Pensacola Blue Wahoos, the Pensacola Pelicans baseball team and of the Pensacola Ice Pilots hockey team until the ECHL terminated the team's franchise after the 2007-2008 season. History=The beginning This station was first constructed at WATM in Atmore, Alabama, broadcasting with 250 watts of power on 1580 kHz. The station, owned by the Southland Broadcasting Company, moved to 1590 kHz to accommodate a power increase to 1,000 watts in 1956. Southland Broadcasting was owned by local broadcaster Tom Miniard and his wife Ernestine. In 1959, the station upgraded to a 5,000-watt signal. This frequency, signal power, and ownership would be maintained unchanged for another two decades. The station was sold in the early 1980s and changed callsigns to WSKR on May 5, 1986. The \\"Kicker\\" changed callsigns again on December 7, 1987, this time to WIZD, and began simulcasting its FM sister station. Months later, the station was sold off to a religious group, the Maranatha Ministries Foundation, who had the FCC change the callsign to WGYJ on March 2, 1988. The new callsign was said to stand for \\"We Give You Jesus\\". Expanded band The Maranatha Ministries Foundation, licensee of WGYJ in Atmore, Alabama, applied for an expanded band frequency at 1620 kHz in June 1997 and this station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on October 6, 1997. The new station, with Atmore, Alabama, as its community of license, was assigned the call letters WPHG by the FCC on November 12, 1997. The callsign was said to stand for \\"We Proclaim His Glory\\". By February 1998, the station had begun broadcast operations while its license application was pending. With the expanded band station on the air, WGYJ handed in its broadcast license on September 11, 1998, and went off the air forever. In September 2000, Maranatha Ministries Foundation, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to ADX Communications of Escambia. (WPHG-FM, the FM sister station, was sold to a different group at the same time.) The deal was approved by the FCC on November 16, 2000, and the transaction was consummated on March 5, 2001. Move to Florida In October 2000, with the sale pending, the permit holder petitioned the FCC to change the station's community of license to Gulf Breeze, Florida, so that it could better serve the more lucrative Pensacola, Florida, area. The FCC finally granted a construction permit for this move on July 10, 2002. With the move approved, the station applied to the FCC for new call letters and on August 19, 2002, was assigned WPNS to reflect the new Pensacola orientation. On March 21, 2003, the station switched callsigns to WBUB then again on July 27, 2004, to the current WNRP. After a move across state lines, an ownership change, several formats and callsign changes, and more than eight years, WNRP finally received its license to cover from the FCC on August 3, 2005. In late 2005, Dave and Mary Hoxeng debuted \\"Classic Country AM1620\\" with live personalities including Pensacola native and Nashville legend Larry Butler.

The use of metal wire in jewelry dates back to the 2nd Dynasty in Egypt and to the Bronze and Iron Ages in Europe.Jack Ogden, ‚ÄòClassical Gold wire: Some Aspects of its Manufacture and Use‚Äô, Jewellery Studies, 5, 1991, pp. 95‚Äì105. In the 20th century, the works of Alexander Calder, Ruth Asawa, and other modern practitioners developed the medium of wire sculpture as an art form. Alexander Calder Alexander Calder (1898‚Äì1976), an American sculptor, greatly developed the use of wire as a medium for sculpture with his kinetic and movement based Cirque Calder, as well as pieces such as Two Acrobats, Romulus and Remus, and Hercules and Lion. In 1926, after a stint spent making toys at the request of a Serbian toy merchant in Paris, Calder began creating his Cirque Calder, a miniature, movable circus that uses movable wire models of various circus performers, like sword eaters and lion tamers.http://ubu.artmob.ca/video/Calder-Alexander_Le-cirque.avi After this, Calder created complete pieces only using wire and in 1927 had a show of wire sculptures at the Weyhe Gallery in New York City. In 1930, he had a solo show of wire sculptures in Paris, at Galerie Billiet. Calder‚Äôs wire sculptures of this period tended to be portraits, caricatures, and stylized representations of people and animals. While originally believing the medium of wire sculpture to be merely clever and amusing, as his work developed, he began to state that wire sculpture had an important place in the history of art and remarked on the great possibilities that lie within the medium.Alexander Calder, unpublished, Alexander Foundation Archives, http://calder.org/historicaltexts/text/1.html‚ÄúThese new studies in wire, however, did not remain the simple modest little things I had done in New York. They are still simple, more simple than before; and therein lie the great possibilities which I have only recently come to feel for the wire medium... There is one thing, in particular, which connects them with history. One of the canons of the futuristic painters, as propounded by Modigliani, was that objects should not be lost to view, but should be shown through the others by making the latter transparent. The wire sculpture accomplishes this in a most decided manner!\\" Ruth Asawa Ruth Asawa came to prominence when her wire sculptures appeared at both the Whitney Museum of American Art and the 1955 S√£o Paulo Art Biennial.Baker, Kenneth (2006-11-18). \\"An overlooked sculptor's work weaves its way into our times\\". San Francisco Chronicle. Asawa learned to use commonplace materials from Josef Albers, her teacher at Black Mountain College, and began experimenting with wire using a variety of techniques.http://www.ruthasawa.com/crochetwire.html In the 1950s, Asawa experimented with crocheted wire sculptures of abstract forms that appear as three dimensional line drawings. She learned the basic technique while in Toluca, Mexico, where villagers used a similar technique to make baskets from galvanized wire. > ‚ÄúI was interested in it because of the economy of a line, making something > in space, enclosing it without blocking it out. It‚Äôs still transparent. I > realized that if I was going to make these forms, which interlock and > interweave, it can only be done with a line because a line can go anywhere.‚Äù In 1962, Asawa began experimenting with tied wire sculptures of images rooted in nature, geometry, and abstraction.http://www.ruthasawa.com/tiedwire.html Contemporary practitioners Contemporary wire artists include: *Brian Boyer uses wire that would otherwise end up in a landfill to create wire trees. Known for his self taught style and use of recycled copper/aluminum wire. His trees combine mathematical formulas, algorithms and equations along with geometric shapes along with flowers and many other abstract patterns in the roots and branches. As of 2018 Brian has had an active profile with the \\"Canadian Council for the Arts\\" and continues to make his one of a kind wire trees under the brand name \\"Forrest Wire\\" *Gavin Worth has used wire sculpture to combine realistic images with 3-d abstract forms. Worth approached Calder's idea of mobility in sculpture by making the viewer the mobile element. By placing varying images on different planes of the sculpture, the image changes as the viewer sees it from different angles.\\"iDn Magazine,\\" Vol. 19, No. 3, \\"Drawing that Elusive Line,\\" July, 2012 *Kue King has built a reputation combining wire and feather. He sculpts wire using a woven additive technique. Instead of creating form with wire framing, he builds with it like clay. *Elizabeth Berrien began working with wire in the 1960s and is hailed as the \\"Godmother of Wire\\" by the wave of emerging wire sculptors she inspired. *Tania Spencer is a multimedia artist in Western Australia currently working with wire. She constructs large scale knitted installations with fencing wire, using drills and hand bending jigs. *Annie Glass is an Australian wire sculptor from Victoria. Her small form sculptures are described as whimsical snapshots of life featuring dogs, children and the human form. Her sculptures feature a refreshing fluidity of movement. Sophie Ryder 's galvanised wire sculpture Sitting at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park Jewelry Wire sculpture jewelry Because the needed tools are simple, wrapped wire jewelry can be learned and performed in home studios by hobby artists. Some of the tools used include pliers, pin vises, file, wire cutters, and mandrels. The wire used may be of a variety of decorative metals in different cross-sections. Wire sculpture jewelry may have beads or gemstones integrated into the design. Metals used For most people who start out working with wire it is not cost effective to jump straight to the precious metals such as silver or gold. Therefore, less expensive craft wires made from softer materials such as brass, copper, aluminum, or gold fill can be used. The artist typically first gains experience exploring form while learning the feel of the wire. There are many ways wire can be handled and wrapped. Progression can be made to the more expensive metals such as 925 sterling silver and 14k gold filled wire. 14k gold filled wire is a tube of 14k gold that has a length of jewellers brass running through the middle. It is not like gold plated wire as there is approx 100 times more gold in gold filled than there is on plated wire. With gold filled wire that is designated 14/20 it means that a minimum 20% of the entire wire is 14k gold. As with solid gold the gold filled wire can come in at least yellow and rose colours enabling the range of jewellery that can be made to be expansive.

Its southern terminus is at Route 3 in Rockland and its northern terminus is at George Washington Boulevard in Hull. Route description Route 228 runs from Route 3 in Rockland, goes through Hingham, and ends at the intersection of George Washington Boulevard in Hull. The exact streets Route 228 follows are: Hingham Street in Rockland; Pond Street in Norwell; Main Street, Short Street, Leavitt Street, East Street, and Hull Street in Hingham (also signed on Whiting Street and Derby Street, due to former strange concurrency with Route 53, see below); Nantasket Avenue in Hull. The center line of Hull Street from north of Glastonbury Abbey to the Hull town line is the town line between Hingham and Cohasset, which is not signed. History The route was designated in 1967, taking over the Hingham and Hull portions of the circumferential Route 128 when that route was truncated back to its intersection with Route 3 in Braintree.\\"Selectmen's Notes-Hingham Selectmen receive letter from Massachusetts Department of Public Works regarding Impending Renumbering of Route 128 to Route 228\\" Hingham Mirror. June 15, 1967, p. 12. The Route 128 designation was established in the late 1920s. Due to complaints about the amount of traffic on Hingham's historic Main Street and other roads in town, the state first proposed building a bypass route starting in the 1930s, however there was never enough funding to start construction. The Massachusetts Department of Public Works (MDPW) finally put together a plan to build a relocated Route 228, or \\"Route 228 Spur\\" in the late 1960s. On February 29, 1968, at Hingham High School, the MDPW presented a plan for an 8-mile, four-lane freeway 250 to 400 feet wide that would run from Route 3 to George Washington Boulevard in Hull. There were three alternatives for the Route 3 interchange: one would have it built in Hingham just south of the existing Derby Street exit with the freeway heading east paralleling Derby and Gardner Streets; the other two were in Norwell; the Pond Street alternative would re-make the existing Route 228 interchange; the third alternative would move the exit further south near where Route 3 crossed Webster Street. All three alternatives would meet at the 'Common Line' near Prospect Street in Hingham and follow a path north, paralleling the western side of what today is Wompatuck State Park. North of Free Street, where an interchange would be built, the MDPW again presented three possible routes northward to George Washington Boulevard: West Line and West-Central Line alternatives that would have paralleled Union Street and would have relocated the Weir River and Triphammer Pond, and an Eastern Line alternative which would have left the waterways alone but paralleled the Weir River through the Turkey Hill area. Each alternative would have included a large interchange with Route 3A with that route being upgraded to a divided highway in the vicinity of the exit. The two Western alternatives would have used the existing George Washington Boulevard bridge (upgraded to handle more traffic) to cross the Weir River into Hull, while the Eastern alternative would have used a new bridge to be constructed to the east and meet George Washington Boulevard near the Hull Dump. Each of the alternatives would have condemned between 17 and 26 homes along the proposed route and cost between $12 million and $14 million. Hingham town officials were receptive to the plan as long as the route started in Norwell and used the Eastern Line Alternative, with an additional interchange at Rockland Street. The townspeople of Norwell, though, voted to oppose any route through their town, citing fears of contaminating their water supply. At a special town meeting in Hingham on September 30, 1968, citizens voted to oppose the Route 228 proposal, 559‚Äì506, especially because, due to Norwell's earlier vote, it appeared the MDPW was leaning toward the Hingham interchange alternative. The town did vote, however, 422‚Äì231, that if the route were to be built despite the town's opposition, that the Pond Street interchange and Eastern Line alternative would be the only proposal Hingham would accept. Continued opposition to routing the freeway in Norwell and parts of Hingham into the early 1970s eventually led the MDPW to give up on the plan.\\"Hingham's Unbuilt Highways, Part 2\\". Out of the Archives Blog, Hingham Historical Society, accessed 1/2/16 Increased traffic along Main Street in Hingham though since then led, after many years of deliberation by Hingham's citizens, to the installation of the first traffic light along the street at the Free Street/Union Street intersection in 2010.Hingham Journal article on light, need citation Routing with Route 53 One of the more distinctive aspects of this short state route was its signed concurrency with Route 53. Traffic heading southbound on Route 228 when approaching Route 53 at Queen Anne's Corner on the Hingham/Norwell town line would sees signs directing traffic on Route 228 South to turn right onto Route 53 North in a wrong-way concurrency for about one mile (1.6 km), not to travel back along its northbound path in Norwell and Rockland. Instead this route never left Hingham, traveling further along the original path of Route 228 along Whiting and Derby Streets. At the point the two routes split, the intersection with Derby Street, Route 228 suddenly becomes a Northbound route. The reassurance shield lists Route 228 North at the beginning of Derby Street, the last reassurance shield in this direction. When traveling south on Route 53 past the Derby Street intersection, the road is signed as Route 53 South and Route 228 South. The concurrency ends at Queen Anne's Corner when Route 228's signage assumes its correct Northbound direction. This however implied there were two distinct Route 228 routings. Maps and Massachusetts Highway Department documents over the years disagree as to whether the Derby and Whiting Street section is officially Route 228. The southbound wrong-way concurrency existed since Route 228 was established, the signs on north Route 53 only appeared during the 1980s. The main purpose of the southbound routing was to help traffic move through the congested Queen Anne's Corner intersection and take a more efficient path to northbound Route 3. After a widening project to improve this intersection was completed in the summer of 2007, however, the signs indicating this routing disappeared. Signs on South 228 and the rest of the intersection now indicate Route 228 South proceeds straight through the intersection from Main Street onto Pond Street and on to Route 3 at Exit 14 (guide signs on Route 53 North at Derby Street were eventually changed as well in 2014 with text 'Derby Street' replacing the MA 228 shields on each sign, though guide signage on Derby Street and North and South 228 shield reassurance markers remain).Photo posted on Misc.

These species can exist as a mixture of tautomers.  Preparation of ligands and complexes Acetylacetone and related 1,3-diketones condense with primary alkyl- or arylamines resulting in replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atoms with NR groups, where R = aryl, alkyl. To prepare 1,3-diketimines from bulky amines, e.g. 2,4,6-trimethylanilines, prolonged reaction times are required. 2,6-Diisopropylaniline is a common bulky building block. Deprotonation of HNacNac compounds affords anionic bidentate ligands that form a variety of coordination complexes. Some derivatives with large R groups can be used to stabilize low valent main group and transition metal complexes. Unlike the situation for the acetylacetonates, the steric properties of the coordinating atoms in NacNac‚àí ligands is adjustable by changes in the R substituent. Attachment to a metal center is usually carried out by initial deprotonation of HNacNac with n-butyllithium; the lithium derivative is then treated with a metal chloride to eliminate LiCl. In some cases, HNacNacs also serve as charge-neutral 1,3-diimine ligands.

For the project, Hijazi collaborated with renowned producers like Jean Saliba and Fady Bitar and worked with some of the biggest names in the industry like Elias Naser, Samer Nakhla and Haytham Ziad. Despite of the negative publicity and controversies over the album's theme, it was a commercial success, topping various charts in countries like Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Morocco, Tunisia, UAE, and Kuwait. In addition, the album received generally positive reviews in the west and was sold highly in the UK, France and Canada. \\"Baya al Ward\\" was the lead single from the album. Despite the controversies over its music video, it was a commercial success and debuted at number one in a number of countries all around the Middle East. After the release of \\"Baya al Ward\\", Hijazi embarked on a highly publicised world tour. She even made a number of guest appearances in talk shows and gave various live concerts. Although there was a great demand for music videos of songs like \\"Rajaa\\", \\"Yala Lally Amaan\\", \\"Lemma Tghmmed Ayneik\\" and \\"Jnoon Bhebbak\\", Hijazi refused to film any of them because of the political instabilities in her native Lebanon. In early 2007, however, she released the music video of \\"Baheb Nuoa Kalamak\\" which gained generally negative reviews from critics due to its low budget and the poor production by Rotana. In addition, the music video was a fail being directed by Mirna Khayat. Critics later advised Hijazi not to cooperate with Khayat for future projects. Despite of the attacks on the album and the music video and the controversies that Hijazi was in fact promoting homosexuality and lesbianism, the album was a bestseller of 2006. According to Hijazi, the Critical reception of her album generally had a positive impact, for it propagated the album. According to the official sales charts provided by Rotana more than three editions of the album were sold in less than a year, and this made Hijazi one of the biggest-selling singers in the Middle East, and one of the most wanted performers on stage. Singles=\\"Ba'ad Sneen\\" \\"Ba'ad Sneen\\" (\\"After Years\\") was released on 2005, becoming the album's lead single. The song portrays Hijazi as a young girl living in a traditional Arab village. When her lover leaves her, she is heartbroken. After many years of punishing her heart and waiting for him, she now finds it hard to accept his wish of coming back to her. There are also many flashbacks of the wonderful time Hijazi and her lover had together. \\"Baya al Ward\\" The album's title track, \\"Baya al Ward\\", directed by Yahya Sadeh is arguably one of the most controversial songs in Lebanese music history. It tells the story of a young girl, turned almost insane by the depression she received when her lover broke his promises. The song opens with Hijazi chopping off beautiful strands of her white-blond hair. She faces the camera and the song begins. She goes down the stairs and smokes and then leaves in a picturesque blue convertible, driving up a long straight road. She drives the car as if in a dream. Later, a thorny plant appears and ravages her body. This scene is mixed between reality and daydreaming and then Hijazi finds herself and her car stopped in front of a tree besides a lake. She later walks towards the water, presumably to commit suicide. \\"Baheb Nuoa Kalamak\\" The album's third single, \\"Baheb Nuoa Kalamak\\" (\\"I love what you say\\") was released in early 2007, directed by Mirna Khayat and chosen over Yahia Sa‚Äôadeh. According to the Qatar-based daily Al Raya, Hijazi revealed that she had received numerous scripts for the clip by different directors because of the immense popularity of the song, even before the music video was released. Despite the poor reviews of the video, the song managed to become one of the greatest hits of 2007 and an essential concert song for Hijazi. Critical reception The music video of the title track \\"Baya al Ward\\" was heavily criticized and caused huge controversies that Hijazi was promoting homosexuality Hijazi denied the allegations, but critics argued that the T-shirt she was wearing in the music video had several symbols imprinted on it, which belonged to a garment manufacturer that specializes in clothing for homosexuals. At a press conference she held in Dubai to announce the launch of her album, Hijazi clarified that she did not know what the symbols on the shirt meant or that she never thought to find out when she chose to wear it. Critics argued that Hijazi had gone to extremes and cut her hair shorter than that of an ordinary man or in other words, the versatile once again changed her looks, trading her brown locks for short pixie whitish-blonde hair and gowns to boyish trousers and T-shirts. In a candid interview, Hijazi stated that with the immense help of her colleagues and some talented image consultants she got this new look to match the jazzy theme of her album's title track. On the other hand, critics began accusing the video of \\"Baya al Ward\\" of being unusual because Hijazi chops her hair off and jumps off a cliff at the end of the video brooding over the guy who left her. In addition, the artwork from the album was criticised for its \\"homosexual\\" theme.

After devastations of the town in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the town was resettled by miners from Saxony. Along with the region, it became part of Kingdom of Prussia in the 18th century. During World War II, the Germans created several forced labour camps in the village, subject to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Thousands of people, women and men were imprisoned there. In 1945 it was assigned to Poland. The totality of the town's population was expelled, completely changing its traditional language and culture. A new Polish name was given to the town.

The original Manhattan Theatre Club production opened on February 29, 2000 and ran for 56 performances. Excellent reviews prompted a move to Broadway. After 25 previews, it opened on November 2, 2000 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where it ran for 777 performances. The original cast, directed by Lynne Meadow, included Linda Lavin as Marjorie, Tony Roberts as Ira, and Michele Lee as Lee. Later in the run, Lavin was replaced first by Valerie Harper and then by Rhea Perlman, while Richard Kind and Marilu Henner assumed the roles of Ira and Lee. Ben Brantley of The New York Times observed, \\"Mr. Busch is best-known for his appealingly warped cinematic parodies in which he plays the nobly suffering or archly conniving leading lady . . . Here the female icon that Mr. Busch comes closest to impersonating is Wendy Wasserstein, the writer of such beloved epigram- slinging hits as The Heidi Chronicles and The Sisters Rosensweig. You may also find yourself thinking of Neil Simon's mid-career comedies, plays that present harried New Yorkers speaking naturally in competitive one-liners . . . Tale has moments cut from the synthetic cloth of television comedy, and it doesn't quite know how to resolve itself. But it earns its wall-to-wall laughs.\\" New York Times review Awards and nominations *Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Off-Broadway Play (nominee) *Outer Critics Circle John Gassner Award for Outstanding Playwrighting (Charles Busch, winner) *Tony Award for Best Play (nominee) *Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play (Linda Lavin, nominee) *Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play (Michele Lee, nominee) *Drama Desk Award for Outstanding New Play (nominee) *Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play (Lavin, nominee) ReferencesExternal links *Internet Broadway Database listing *Lortel Archives listing *Tale of the Allergist's Wife at ThatTheatreSite.com 2000 plays Plays by Charles Busch Broadway plays Comedy plays Plays set in New York City Midlife crisis in fiction ","title":"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife"},{"id":"9612211","text":"Highlands Today was a newspaper published in Sebring, Florida.

The effect is commonly described as being caused by the greater mobility of electrons relative to that of positive ions within the flame, and the asymmetric nature of the electrodes used to detect the phenomenon. This effect is used by rectification flame sensors to detect the presence of flame. The rectifying effect of the flame on an AC voltage allows the presence of flame to be distinguished from a resistive leakage path. One experimental study suggested that the effect is caused by the ionization process occurring mostly at the base of the flame, making it more difficult for the electrode further from the base of the flame to attract positive ions from the burner, yet leaving the electron current largely unchanged with distance because of the greater mobility of the electron charge carriers.

By reducing car travel, travel plans can improve health and wellbeing, free up car parking space, and make a positive contribution to the community and the environment. Every travel plan is different, but most successful plans have followed a structured processTravel Plan process overview (Land Transport NZ, NZ) in their development: The term has now largely replaced green transport plan as the accepted UK term for a concept, which first emerged in the US in the 1970s (as site-based transportation demand management) and subsequently transferred to the Netherlands in 1989, where the terms company or commuter mobility management were applied. Features From the above and other definitions, these common features underpin the concept:Sustainable Transport, Mobility Management and Travel Plans, Ashgate, Farnham, 2012, Enoch M P *Travel plans are not really an instrument themselves but a delivery mechanism or strategy for other mostly transport-focused measures. *Travel plans are delivered by an additional 'agent' that is not a part of the 'traditional' transport policy institutional structure. *Travel plans are initiated in two ways by the organisation or by the government. *Travel plans seek to deliver transport and related benefits to the community as well as some more direct organisational benefits to the participating 'delivery agents'. *Travel plans are, to some extent, site-specific and so tailored to the specific contextual circumstances. *Travel plans deliver, to some extent, a package or a strategy of a wide variety of transport instruments. They can work well the 'package approach' allows complementary tools to be implemented in one go, which means effective but unpopular tools (such as parking restrictions) can be introduced alongside popular but expensive tools (like bus subsidies) to deliver the required benefits whilst cancelling out the negative impacts. Next, the use of the additional 'agent' such as a workplace, school or even a football club which means that travel plans replace the largely negative relationship between local authorities and citizens with a more positive relationship (such as between employer and employee or between school and parent/pupil). Finally, the site l-specific nature of travel plans means they are developed at the neighbourhood level and so focus directly on the transport needs of the users in that local area. The concept works by developing balanced packages of user- focused transport tools in a partnership that seeks to provide meaningful benefits to each of the stakeholders involved: improved travel choices to the individuals; cost savings, happier and healthier staff and better company image to the implementing organisations; additional business opportunities to service providers and congestion reduction and improved air quality to the government. Workplace The UK Department for Transport defines workplace travel plans as a package of measures produced by employers to encourage staff to use alternatives to single-occupancy car use. The first travel Ppans in the UK were adopted in Nottingham by Nottinghamshire County Council in 1995. Travel plans are now common in the UK, and are starting to become more common in many places throughout Europe as well as in Australia and New Zealand. A workplace can choose to develop a travel plan at any time be required to develop a travel plan as a condition of planning consent for an expansion or new development. Typical actions in a workplace travel plan include improving facilities for pedestrians and cyclists (showers, lockers and cycle parking), promotion and subsidy of public transport, and encouraging carpooling, working from home and teleconferencing. School Making it safer and easier for children to walk, cycle or catch public transport to school has long-term health benefits, reduces air pollution and traffic congestion, and helps children arrive at school awake, refreshed and ready to learn. Because of the many benefits, local councils in the UK, Australia and New Zealand are actively involved in helping schools to develop and implement travel plans. In Canada, a national pilot project running from 2010 to 2012 is designed to bring stakeholders together to build school travel plans collaboratively. Typical actions in a school travel plan include promoting the health benefits of walking, providing more or better pedestrian crossings, tighter enforcement of parking and traffic rules around the school, providing cycle training, and setting up a walking school bus.Walking School Bus website School travel planning groups like Green Communities Canada also work on a policy level to encourage multi-tiered governmental policies that support active travel. Framework A framework travel plan may be used for speculative development such as a business park where the occupiers of buildings are not knownhttp://www3.hants.gov.uk/workplacetravel/information_for_developers/frameworktravelplans.htm or where there will be multiple occupiers (such as a shared office block). Other organisations There are many examples of successful travel plans for tertiary campuses. Successful tertiary travel plans are usually prepared with the assistance of the local public transport agency. As well as the initiatives listed for school or workplace travel plans, tertiary travel plans can include a U-pass system for student travel on public transport. The development of travel plans for hospitals is a relatively new and interesting field of travel planning. Planning consent A real-estate developer may be required to provide a travel plan as a condition to gaining planning consent. A typical travel plan for a new development will provide for the promotion of sustainable transport through marketing initiatives and for contributions to public transport and to walking and cycling infrastructure. In the UK, a travel plan can form part of a Section 106 agreement, under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
