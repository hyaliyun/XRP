Secret Temptation) is a 2015 South Korean romantic thriller film written and directed by Yoon Jae-gu, based on the novel La Femme de paille (\\"Woman of Straw\\") by Catherine Arley.  Plot Yoo Ji-yeon is a Korean university graduate who is stuck working as a waiter under the name \\"Jenny Yoo\\" in a Macanese bar after her colleague stole her credit card and all of her money before running away, forcing her to pay her increasingly rising debt. Her Macanese friend offers her a job interview with Kim Sung-yeol, the illegitimate son of Kim Seok-gu, a successful gambling corporation chairman who owns half of the casinos in Macau. Sung-yeol asks Ji-yeon to become Seok-gu's new bride, so she can inherit his property and divide it for the two of them. Sung-yeol is unable to inherit his property due to his status. Seok-gu has become grumpy since his family's deaths years ago Ji-yeon reluctantly learns manners resembling Seok- gu's late wife to better her chance in attracting the old man. Arriving at his yacht, Ji-yeon becomes a part of Seok-gu's attendants that include the Korean ship captain and maid Ji Yoo-mi who takes care of Seok-gu's pet chihuahua, the Russian Viktor, and the Pakistani Khan. Having to endure Seok-gu's constant lashing, criticism, and various other rhetoric, Ji-yeon nevertheless is able to stand up and change him into a less irascible person, even managing to make him play the piano again, an activity that used to be his hobby until his family's demise. Seok-gu in turn reveals about his past as a \\"circus\\" player in Macau, his reasons for using the whistle and constantly shouting, and also mentions a woman who helped him achieve his success. Ji-yeon though is dispirited one night and searches solace in Sung-yeol, with whom she has fallen in love. Khan, however, sneaks on their conversations and begins to keep a watchful eye on the two. The other night, Ji-yeon has had enough and tries to leave, all while stating her discomfort of having to live for 10 years with Seok-gu even if the plan did work, in front of Sung-yeol. To her surprise, Seok-gu proposes to her the next day and has apparently modified his will to include her name. He states to Sung-yeol before the reception that he ignored him as he possesses \\"90% work, but not 10% luck\\" and thus not fit to inherit the casinos. At the wedding reception, Seok-gu nicknames Ji-yeon \\"Cinderella\\". However, Ji-yeon discovers to her horror that Seok-gu has died the night after the reception. Sung-yeol tells her that they have to act normal until their arrival to Busan, followed by delivering Seok-gu's body to his home until Sung-yeol can sign his father's modified will that includes Ji- yeon's inheritance. Ji-yeon tries hard to keep the act in front of Seok-gu's personal assistant, Jang Hye-jin, who is beginning to suspect something. Eventually, she is caught by the police and accused as the murderer. She learns that Sung-yeol has prepared to inherit 10% of the estate since five years ago, with 90% of them donated for charity due to the South Korean inheritance law; Sung-yeol has been using her since the beginning so he could not only inherit the business but also to avenge his mother's abandonment by Seok-gu. Escorted to the prison, Ji-yeon sees Khan unsuccessfully trying to reach her and shouting \\"Camera!\\". While scanning the identification papers, Ji-yeon realizes that the woman mentioned by Seok-gu is Hye-jin. Using Seok- gu's wording, Hye-jin frees Ji-yeon into probation so she can attend Seok-gu's funeral. There, Ji-yeon attempts to reach Khan, only to be apprehended, and from the crime scene photos further realizes that Seok-gu's chihuahua has been fitted with a camera that also recorded Seok-gu's real murderer: Sung-yeol. Khan is the only one knowing this, but Sung-yeol kills him to silence him. The chihuahua is currently carried by Yoo-mi, who is hunted by Sung-yeol. Ji-yeon manages to reach their rendezvous place and after a struggle, is able to get the camera and knocks down Sung-yeol with Yoo-mi's help. Sung-yeol is arrested for the murders while Ji-yeon's inheritance as Seok-gu's wife is realized, making her the new owner of the Macanese casinos. Ji-yeon visits Sung-yeol at the prison to hear his reasons and that he never loved her. Just before she leaves, Sung-yeol tells her that he is the one who made her \\"Cinderella\\": Ji- yeon gives a smile.

While being transported in a police van, Gray sustained injuries and was taken to the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center. Gray died on April 19, 2015; his death was ascribed to injuries to his spinal cord. On April 21, 2015, pending an investigation of the incident, six Baltimore police officers were suspended. The circumstances of the injuries were initially unclear; eyewitness accounts suggested that the officers involved used unnecessary force against Gray during the arrest‚Äîa claim denied by all officers involved. Commissioner Anthony W. Batts reported that, contrary to department policy, the officers did not secure Gray inside the van while driving to the police station; this policy had been put into effect six days prior to Gray's arrest, following review of other transport-related injuries sustained during police custody in the city, and elsewhere in the country during the preceding years. The medical investigation found that Gray had sustained the injuries while in transport. The medical examiner's office concluded that Gray's death could not be ruled an accident, and was instead a homicide, because officers failed to follow safety procedures \\"through acts of omission.\\" On May 1, 2015, the Baltimore City State's Attorney, Marilyn Mosby, announced her office had filed charges against six police officers after the medical examiner's report ruled Gray's death a homicide. The prosecutors stated that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six police officers who were believed to be involved in his death. The officer driving the van was charged with second-degree \\"depraved-heart\\" murder for his indifference to the considerable risk that Gray might be killed, and others were charged with crimes ranging from manslaughter to illegal arrest. On May 21, a grand jury indicted the officers on most of the original charges filed by Mosby with the exception of the charges of illegal imprisonment and false arrest, and added charges of reckless endangerment to all the officers involved. Gray's hospitalization and subsequent death resulted in an ongoing series of protests. On April 25, 2015, a major protest in downtown Baltimore turned violent, resulting in 34 arrests and injuries to 15 police officers. After Gray's funeral on April 27, civil disorder intensified with looting and burning of local businesses and a CVS drug store, culminating with a state of emergency declaration by Governor Larry Hogan, Maryland National Guard deployment to Baltimore, and the establishment of a curfew. On May 3, the National Guard started withdrawing from Baltimore, and the night curfew on the city was lifted. In September 2015, it was decided that there would be separate trials for the accused. The trial against Officer William Porter ended in mistrial. Officers Nero, Goodson, and Rice were acquitted. The remaining charges against the officers were dropped on July 27, 2016. On September 12, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it would not bring federal charges against the six Baltimore police officers involved in the arrest and in-custody death of Freddie Gray. However, it was announced on October 5, 2017 that non-criminal, internal disciplinary trials for the officers will be prosecuted by a three person-panel chaired by someone from another Maryland police agency, likely Prince George's County, and that outside lawyer and former chair of the Baltimore City School Board Neil Duke will serve on the panel as well. Backgrounds Freddie Gray Freddie Carlos Gray Jr. (August 16, 1989 ‚Äì April 19, 2015) was the 25-year-old son of Gloria Darden. He had a twin sister, Fredericka Gray, as well as another sister, Carolina. At the time of his death, Gray lived in the home owned by his sisters in the Gilmor Homes neighborhood. He stood and weighed . Gray had a criminal record, on drug charges and minor crimes and had spent time in jail. Gray's family had won a settlement from their landlord in 2008 involving failure to remove lead paint from their home: research has shown that lead exposure \\"can diminish cognitive function, increase aggression and ultimately exacerbate the cycle of poverty that is already exceedingly difficult to break.\\" Police officers  * Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr., age 45, is a 16-year veteran of the police force. * Officer Garrett E. Miller, age 26, joined the Baltimore Police Department in 2012. * Officer Edward M. Nero, age 29, joined the Baltimore Police Department in 2012. * Officer William G. Porter, age 25, joined the police force in 2012. * Lieutenant Brian W. Rice, age 41, is a 17-year-veteran of the force. Rice, who was promoted to lieutenant in 2011, is the highest-ranking officer charged in relation to Gray's death. The Guardian reported that, in 2012, Rice had allegedly threatened to kill himself and the husband of his former partner. He had been hospitalized, reportedly, for a mental health evaluation and given an administrative suspension. The consequences of this threat included twice having his guns confiscated, and a restraining order on behalf of the husband of his former partner. According to a police report obtained by The Guardian, Rice had also misused his position to order the arrest of his ex-girlfriend's husband as part of a personal dispute that took place two weeks before the incident. * Sergeant Alicia D. White, age 30, joined the force in 2010 and was promoted to sergeant three months prior to Gray's death. She grew up in Baltimore. Arrest and death Timeline of Freddie Gray's arrest Police encountered Freddie Gray on the morning of April 12, 2015, in the street near Baltimore's Gilmor Homes housing project, an area known to have high levels of home foreclosures, poverty, drug deals and violent crime. Approximately three weeks prior to the incident, Mosby had requested \\"enhanced\\" drug enforcement efforts at the corner of North and Mount. According to the charging documents submitted by the Baltimore police, at 8:39 a.m Lieutenant Brian W. Rice, Officer Edward Nero, and Officer Garrett E. Miller were patrolling on bicycles and made eye contact with Gray, who proceeded to flee on foot \\"unprovoked upon noticing police presence\\". After a brief chase, Gray was apprehended and taken into custody \\"without the use of force or incident\\", according to Officer Garrett Miller, who wrote he \\"noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his [Gray's] front right pocket\\". In the formal statement of charges, Officer Miller stated that Gray \\"did unlawfully carry, possess, and sell a knife commonly known as a switch blade knife, with an automatic spring or other device for opening and/or closing the blade within the limits of Baltimore City. The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted one hand operated knife.\\" According to the state's attorney for Baltimore City, the spring-assisted knife Gray was carrying was legal under Maryland law, while a police task force said the knife was a violation of the Baltimore code under which Gray was charged. Video recordings by two bystanders capturing Gray's arrest showed Gray, screaming, being dragged to a police van by officers, and then stepping up into the van. A bystander with connections to Gray stated that the officers were previously \\"folding\\" Gray: one officer bent Gray's legs backwards, and another held Gray down by pressing a knee into his neck. Witnesses commented Gray \\"couldn't walk\\", \\"can't use his legs\\". Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts noted from the video that, \\"Gray stood on one leg and climbed into the van on his own.\\" The Baltimore Sun reported that another witness saw Gray being beaten with police batons. According to the police timeline, Gray was placed in a transport van within 11 minutes of his arrest, and within 30 minutes, paramedics were summoned to take Gray to a hospital. The van made four confirmed stops while Gray was detained. At 8:46 am, Gray was unloaded in order to be placed in leg irons because police said he was acting irate. Gray's shackling was recorded on a cellphone, which exhibited a motionless Gray surrounded by several officers as he was restrained. A later stop, recorded by a private security camera, shows the van stopped at a grocery store. At 8:59 am, a second prisoner was placed in the vehicle while officers checked on Gray's condition. At 9:24 am, the transport van arrived at its final stop, the West District police station. After paramedics treated Gray for 21 minutes, he was taken to the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at 9:45 am in a coma. The media has suggested the possibility of a rough ride‚Äîa form of police brutality where a handcuffed prisoner is placed without a seatbelt in an erratically driven vehicle‚Äîas a contributing factor in Gray's injury. During Officer Goodson's trial, a prosecution witness testified that he \\"could not say\\" if there had been a rough ride, and the judge ruled that the prosecution had not presented evidence to back that assumption. Moreover, and as noted by the BBC in December 2015, \\"Throughout the trial, the prosecution insisted that Mr Porter could have saved Gray's life by restraining him and by calling for medical help after his injury. They described the police van as a coffin on wheels.\\" Subsequently, in June 2016, the Baltimore Sun noted that Dr. Carol Allan, an assistant medical examiner, \\"testified that Gray's fatal neck injuries, resembling those suffered in a diving accident, were caused by abrupt force to his neck during his transport, when he could not see outside the van to predict sudden stops, starts or turns.\\" The department's seatbelt policy had been revised six days prior to Gray's arrest, in an attempt to protect detained individuals from serious injuries during transport. The policy was not followed in Gray's case. According to attorney Michael Davey, who represents at least one of the officers under investigation, the new rules were criticized by some. He explained that in certain situations, like when a prisoner is combative, \\"It is not always possible or safe for officers to enter the rear of those transport vans that are very small, and this one was very small.\\" In the following week, according to the Gray family attorney, Gray suffered from total cardiopulmonary arrest at least once but was resuscitated without ever regaining consciousness. He remained in a coma, and underwent extensive surgery in an effort to save his life. According to his family, he lapsed into a coma with three fractured vertebrae, injuries to his voice box, and his spine 80% severed at his neck. Police confirmed that the spinal injury led to Gray's death. Gray died on April 19, 2015, a week after his arrest. Aftermath Investigation The Baltimore Police Department suspended six officers with pay pending an investigation of Gray's death. The six officers involved in the arrest were identified as Lieutenant Brian Rice, Sergeant Alicia White, Officer William Porter, Officer Garrett Miller, Officer Edward Nero, and Officer Caesar Goodson.Miller, Jayne. 6 officers suspended in Freddie Gray case, WBAL, April 20, 2015. Retrieved April 30, 2015. On April 24, 2015, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, \\"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\\" Batts also acknowledged police did not follow procedure when they failed to buckle Gray in the van while he was being transported to the police station. The U.S. Department of Justice also opened an investigation into the case. On April 30, 2015, Kevin Moore, one of the witnesses who filmed Gray's arrest, was arrested at gunpoint following what Moore described as \\"harassment and intimidation\\" by police. Moore stated he had cooperated with police, and gave over his video of Gray's arrest for investigation. He claimed, despite aiding in the investigation, his photo was made public by police, who asked the public to identify him because he was \\"wanted for questioning.\\" Moore said the police obviously knew who he was when they posted his photo. Moore was released from custody the next day, but two other individuals who were arrested along with Moore remained in custody. The same day as Moore's arrest, medical examiners reported Gray sustained more injuries as a result of slamming into the inside of the transport van, \\"apparently breaking his neck; a head injury he sustained matches a bolt in the back of the van\\". On May 19, 2015, prosecutors asked a judge to place a gag order on attorneys, police, and witnesses of the arrest, arguing that statements by the attorneys of some of the officers charged could prejudice the public. On June 8, 2015, it was announced that a judge had denied the state's attorney's request for a gag order on procedural grounds.  Charges, indictments, and trials  On May 1, 2015, after receiving a medical examiner's report ruling Gray's death a homicide, state prosecutors said that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six officers involved. Mosby said that the Baltimore police had acted illegally and that \\"No crime had been committed\\" (by Freddie Gray). Mosby said that Gray \\"suffered a critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside the BPD wagon\\". Mosby said officers had \\"failed to establish probable cause for Mr. Gray's arrest, as no crime had been committed\\", and charged officers with false imprisonment, because Gray was carrying a pocket knife of legal size, and not the switchblade police claimed he had possessed at the time of his arrest. All six officers were taken into custody and processed at Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center. Three of the officers faced manslaughter charges and one faced an additional count of second degree depraved-heart murder. The murder charge carries a possible penalty of 30 years in prison; the manslaughter and assault offenses carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. All six officers were released from jail after posting bail the same day they were booked. Two officers were released on $250,000 bail and the four others' bail was $350,000. Baltimore police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray. Top row left to right: Caesar R. Goodson Jr., Garrett E. Miller and Edward M. Nero. Bottom row left to right: William G. Porter, Brian W. Rice and Alicia D. White On September 2, 2015, it was decided to hold separate trials for the accused. In December 2015, Baltimore judge Barry Williams declared a mistrial in the trial of Officer Porter after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. In May 2016, Judge Williams declared Officer Nero not guilty by means of a bench trial. On June 23, 2016, Officer Caesar Goodson was acquitted of all charges by Circuit Judge Barry Williams. In June 2016, law professor John Banzhaf of George Washington University filed a complaint with the bar against Marilyn Mosby for prosecutorial misconduct. In January 2017, a federal judge allowed a lawsuit by five of the six police officers unsuccessfully charged by Mosby. Mosby was being sued for malicious prosecution, defamation, and invasion of privacy. =Response to charges= Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said there was no place in the Baltimore Police department for those police officers who \\"choose to engage in violence, brutality, [and] racism\\". Gene Ryan, president of the police union chapter said that despite the tragic situation, \\"none of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray.\\" President Barack Obama said it was vital that the truth be found and supported protests if they were peaceful. In a May 4, 2015, interview on Fox News, Alan Dershowitz said that he believes Mosby overcharged the officers in an attempt to satisfy protesters and prevent further disturbances. Former Baltimore Prosecutor Page Croyder penned an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun where she described Mosby's charges as reflecting \\"either incompetence or an unethical recklessness\\". Croyder opined that Mosby circumvented normal procedures \\"to step into the national limelight\\", and that she \\"pandered to the public\\", creating an expectation of a conviction. A motion for Mosby to recuse herself from the case was filed on behalf of the charged officers, on the alleged basis of personal gain by Mosby and her husband, personal relationships with potential witnesses, and the financial interest of Gray's attorney, who the motion claims is a close friend of Mosby. CNN's legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin pointed out that he does not see any serious conflict of interest to disqualify Mosby from the case, and that the officers may not have a case with that motion. The lawyers representing the officers filed a motion insisting that the city must pay thousands of dollars in damages for arresting and detaining them‚Äîor else they could sue Mosby and the Mayor of Baltimore, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. In an 11-page rebuttal, Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow wrote that Gray was detained \\"well before the arresting officers knew he possessed a knife\\" and that the motion was absurdly \\"bounc[ing] from one ridiculous allegation to another, like a pinball on a machine far past 'TILT. Mosby was ordered to respond to the motion filed by the defense attorneys by June 26, 2015. =Officer William G. Porter= Porter met up with the van after Goodson called dispatchers to ask for an officer to come check on Gray. He was requested twice by Gray for a medic, but did not call for one. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter; second degree assault; misconduct in office. Porter posted a 350,000 bail. The grand jury indicted Porter on all charges and added an indictment of reckless endangerment. On December 16, 2015, a mistrial was declared on all charges, after the jury was hung and could not come to a decision. Porter's second trial was scheduled for June 13, 2016. Analysts stated that the Porter's retrial could have caused problems for the other trials, under the presumption that he could not be compelled to testify while there are pending charges against him. After several appeals and reversals, the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that Porter would be required to testify in the cases against the other officers. Officer Porter's retrial date was originally scheduled for September 6, 2016. On July 27, 2016, all charges against him were dropped. =Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr.= Officer Goodson, the driver of the van, was charged with second-degree depraved heart murder; involuntary manslaughter; second-degree assault; manslaughter by vehicle (gross negligence); manslaughter by vehicle (criminal negligence); and misconduct in office. He posted a 350,000 bail. The grand jury indicted Goodson on all charges and added an indictment of reckless endangerment.

Miller was charged with two counts of second degree assault; two counts of misconduct in office; and false imprisonment. Nero was charged with two counts of second degree assault; misconduct in office and false imprisonment. Each posted a 250,000 bail. The false imprisonment charges were dropped by the grand jury, but an indictment of reckless endangerment was added. Judge Williams found Officer Nero not guilty of all charges on May 23, 2016. Officer Miller's trial date was set for July 27, 2016. At his pretrial hearing on July 27, 2016, however, all charges against Miller and officers Porter and White were dropped. =Lt. Brian W. Rice= The officer who initially made eye contact with Gray while on a bicycle patrol. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter; two counts of second degree assault; manslaughter by vehicle (gross negligence); two counts of misconduct in office; and false imprisonment. He posted a 350,000 bail. The false imprisonment charges were dropped by the grand jury, which added an indictment of reckless endangerment. Judge Williams dropped one of the assault charges after the prosecution rested, ruling there was not enough evidence to prove second-degree assault. Lt. Rice's trial began July 7, 2016. Rice was found not guilty on all counts by Judge Barry Williams on July 18, 2016. =Sgt. Alicia D. White= White was accused of not calling for medical assistance when she encountered Gray, \\"despite the fact she was advised that he needed a medic\\". She was charged with involuntary manslaughter; second degree assault; and misconduct. She posted a 350,000 bail. The grand jury indicted White on all charges and added an indictment of reckless endangerment. Sgt. White's trial date was originally set for October 13, 2016. On July 27, 2016, all charges against her were dropped.  Federal investigations  Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced on , 2015, that the Department of Justice would conduct a review of the current practices of Baltimore Police Department on account of the \\"serious erosion of public trust\\" in relation to the circumstances of Gray's death. The review took effect immediately, and focused on allegations that Baltimore police officers use excessive force, including deadly force, conduct unlawful searches, seizures or arrests, and engage in discriminatory policing. , Federal authorities were conducting three probes into Baltimore police, the \\"pattern of practice\\" investigation initiated by Lynch, a collaborative review that began in the fall of 2014, and a civil rights probe into the death of Gray. On September 12, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it will not bring federal charges against the six Baltimore police officers involved in the arrest and in-custody death of Freddie Gray. Public response Protesters at a police station near the site of Gray's arrest on April 25 Public reaction to the death has drawn further parallels to the response to the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, as part of a larger string of controversial uses of force by police officers in the United States against African Americans. , 22 demonstrations had been held nationwide in direct response to Gray's death or in solidarity with Baltimore. Additionally, the Black Lives Matter movement has protested Gray's death. On April 18, 2015, hundreds of people participated in a protest outside the Baltimore Police Department. Three days later, on April 21, 2015, according to Reuters, \\"[h]undreds of demonstrators gathered in Baltimore\\", protesting Gray's death. The next day, Gene Ryan, the president of the local lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, expressed sympathy for the Gray family, but criticized the \\"rhetoric of protests\\" and suggested that \\"the images seen on television look and sound much like a lynch mob\\". William Murphy, attorney for the Gray family, demanded an \\"immediate apology and a retraction\\". Ryan defended his statement two days later, while admitting that the wording was poor. Charles M. Blow of The New York Times, reminded of a column he wrote several years ago, said that comparing protests to lynch mobs was too extreme because it inflames racial tensions by belittling the significance of the history of lynching in the United States. On April 25, 2015, protests were organized in downtown Baltimore, and the protests turned violent as protesters threw rocks and set fires. Many protesters were angered students after being removed from their primary mode of transportation (city buses) and told to disperse from the city. Tension between the riot police and students grew as time passed, eventually leading to bottles and bricks thrown in protest of the large police presence of a so far peaceful protest of Gray's deathhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/how-baltimore-riots-began- mondawmin-purge/ At least 34 people were arrested, and 15 officers were injured. On April 27, rioting and looting began after the funeral of Gray, with two patrol cars destroyed and 15 officers reported injured. Protesters looted and burned down a CVS Pharmacy location in downtown Baltimore. In reaction to the unrest, the Maryland State Police sent 82 troopers to protect the city. A Baltimore Orioles baseball game against the Chicago White Sox scheduled for the evening was postponed due to the unrest. The next game commenced as scheduled but, as a precautionary measure, the match was played behind closed doors. The next series against the Tampa Bay Rays was moved to St. Petersburg. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency, and activated the Maryland National Guard. Hogan also activated 500 state troopers for duty in Baltimore and requested an additional 5,000 police officers from other locales. At a press conference, Baltimore's mayor announced there would be a citywide curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 am. School trips were canceled until mid-May, and Baltimore's city schools were closed on April 28. In addition, both the University of Maryland campus in downtown Baltimore and the Mondawmin Mall were closed early. Protests outside Baltimore also took place in other U.S. cities. In New York City, 143 people at Union Square were arrested on April 29, 2015 for blocking traffic and refusing to relocate. On the same day, outside the White House in Washington, D.C., nearly 500 protesters converged without an incident. In Denver, eleven people were arrested as protesters were involved in physical altercations with officers. Other protests in response to Gray's death took place in cities including Chicago, Minneapolis, Miami, Philadelphia, Portland, and Seattle. On May 3, 2015, the National Guard began withdrawing from Baltimore, and the night curfew on the city was lifted. The demobilizing process lasted three days, during which time the state of emergency remained in effect. = Spike in Baltimore homicides = In May 2015, there were 43 homicides in Baltimore, making it the deadliest month in 40 years behind August 1972 (45 homicides) and December 1971 (44 homicides). The monthly homicide rate fell to 29 in June 2015 but in July 2015, 45 murders were recorded, tying with the record in 1972. Lt. Gene Ryan, president of Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police, said this was partly due to an increase of confidence among criminals in Baltimore. Then-police commissioner, Anthony Batts, blamed drugs looted from pharmacies during the riots for the spike in crime. The 2015 homicide total as of July 31 was 189 compared to 119 by the end of July 2014. On August 3, in an attempt to solve the cases, Baltimore announced the Baltimore Federal Homicide Task Force. It is a partnership of the Baltimore police and five federal crime- fighting agencies. The agencies will each embed two agents with the Baltimore police to help investigate. On July 8, 2015, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake fired Anthony Batts, saying that his response to the death of Gray had become a distraction, while the police failed to prevent the spike in homicides. Baltimore ended the year with 344 homicides, the second-highest total behind 1993, when 353 murders occurred. It was also the first time since 1999 that the city recorded at least 300 homicides within a calendar year.  Settlement  On September 8, 2015, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced that the city had reached a $6.4 million settlement with Gray's family. Rawlings-Blake said the settlement \\"should not be interpreted as a judgment on the guilt or innocence of the officers facing trial\\", but had been negotiated to avoid \\"costly and protracted litigation that would only make it more difficult for our city to heal\\". The city offered a settlement before they were sued.  Charges against three remaining officers dropped  On July 27, 2016, prosecutors dropped the remaining charges against the three remaining officers. In popular culture The death of Gray has been the subject of several songs. Prince recorded a song called \\"Baltimore\\" for his 2015 album Hit n Run Phase Two. The music video featured scenes from protests in response to Gray's death. In May 2015, Salomon Faye released \\"Black Power\\", a music video on YouTube that shows rallies in the aftermath of Gray's death. Janelle Mon√°e and Wondaland released Hell You Talmbout in 2015 and said the names of those killed by the police, including Freddie Gray. Dru Hill dedicated their 2016 song \\"Change\\" to Gray. In 2016, Kevin Morby released \\"Beautiful Strangers\\", which addressed issues plaguing the world: gun violence, the death of Freddie Gray, and attacks in Orlando and Paris. In 2017, jazz pianist Lafayette Gilchrist released a song called \\"Blues For Freddie Gray\\" on his New Urban World Blues record. Later the same year, singer-songwriter Eliot Bronson penned \\"Rough Ride\\", a song about Gray. In 2017, HBO produced Baltimore Rising, a documentary about Gray's death and the subsequent protests. Directed by Sonja Sohn, it charts the impact of the incident on the people of Baltimore. In May 2018, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks released a song entitled \\"Bike Lane\\" on their Sparkle Hard album. The song references the Freddie Gray case. In March 2017, the Undisclosed podcast launched a 16-part series entitled \\"The Killing of Freddie Gray\\" in which it reviewed the evidence, political atmosphere and circumstances around the death of Freddie Gray.

It is located by the foot of Fj√§lls√§tern, near the center of the residential district of Tureborg (which is named for Tureborg Castle, a ruin atop the mountain's summit). Carved into the sheer cliff face, it was intended as the final resting place of the local politician and publicist Ture Malmgren. Despite his own wishes, Malmgren was instead interred elsewhere after his death in 1922, effectively rendering the empty rock-cut tomb a cenotaph of sorts. History Ture Malmgren (born in 1851) is primarily known as the founder of the regional newspaper Bohusl√§ningen, which remains in publication today. Other than his career as a publicist and journalist, he maintained extensive business connections, and was involved in many fields of politics, often radical. Among other things, he was the first chairman of the Uddevalla Suffrage Association, chaired the Uddevalla City Council for many years, and campaigned as a candidate for the Riksdag. In addition to these engagements he was also a keen builder, and constructed several large buildings. Of these, only Villa Elfkullen still stands ‚Äì his large mock castle Tureborg burned down in 1950, and the faux-medieval summer residence Fj√§llhyddan was demolished later in the 20th century. Aside from these three main buildings, many other minor structures created by Malmgren are dotted around the surrounding landscape. One of these is a vaulted cavern cut into the grey rock of Fj√§lls√§tern at some point between the 1890s and the 1920s. Following his death on 3 August 1922, the local authorities decided against burying him in his intended final resting place, and instead he was buried at the nearby Eastern Cemetery. There, where he was joined by his wife Hilma Malmgren following her death in 1942, a large tombstone bearing his portrait was raised. The old tomb is now bricked up.

E. Housman's 1896 collection A Shropshire Lad. A typical performance lasts around 22 minutes. It was premiered by Gervase Elwes, Frederick Kiddle and the Schwiller Quartet on 15 November 1909 in the Aeolian Hall, London. It was later orchestrated by the composer in a version first performed on 24 January 1924.Trevor Hold, Parry to Finzi: Twenty English Song-composers, Woodbridge 2002, p.113 Subsequent editions show a measure excised from the final movement (Clun): the third measure from the end. The Boosey and Hawkes 1946 score notes indicates this in a footnote on the last page. The cycle was recorded by Elwes, Kiddle and the London String Quartet in 1917. The Roman numerals in this list of the songs are taken from A Shropshire Lad: # XXXI \\"On Wenlock Edge\\" # XXXII \\"From Far, from Eve and Morning\\" # XXVII \\"Is My Team Ploughing\\" # XVIII \\"Oh, When I Was in Love with You\\" # XXI \\"Bredon Hill\\" (first line: \\"In summertime on Bredon\\") # L \\"Clun\\" (Housman's title, and the first line: \\"Clunton and Clunbury\\") An earlier version of \\"Is My Team Ploughing?\\", for voice and piano, had been performed on 26 January 1909 in a concert sponsored by Gervase Elwes and James Friskin.

Poetry  His poetry is characterized by lyricism and a pessimistic view of the relationship between man and society, with characters often marked by loneliness and a certain contrast between passion and rationality. Often this contrast is symbolically sought from San Secondo in the confrontation between the Italian North, characterized by a rational life, concrete and gray, and the Italian South characterized as a mythical dream, passionate colors of life. Among his most important plays are La sirena ricanta, which debuted in 1908, and Marionette, che passione! in 1917, a work that kindled the interest of Luigi Pirandello, who pushed for the work to be recognized. The plot of Marionette, che passione! is focused on the meeting of three random characters, unable to make sense of their lives. The three are revealed in the end to be puppets, at the mercy of fate. A grotesque drama, some link the work to Pirandellism. According to Gaetano Savatteri, the true significance of Rosso di San Secondo was overshadowed by the figure of Pirandello. Following the great success of Marionette, che passione!, Rosso di San Secondo wrote several other plays, including La bella addormentata in 1919, L'ospite desiderato in 1921, Tra vestiti che ballano in 1927, Il ratto di Proserpina del 1954, Una cosa di carne, Il delirio dell'oste Bass√†, Amara. He also wrote fiction books, such as novellas collected in Ponentino in 1916 and the novel La Fuga 1917. Rosso di San Secondo is buried in the cemetery Angeli di Caltanissetta.

It was built in the fashionable Neo-Gothic style and included a schoolroom and teacher‚Äôs house with parlour, kitchen and two bedrooms. The curriculum of the private school was narrow and designed to fit pupils for their station in life, either in service or as farm labourers on the Neeld estates. In 1860 Miss Elizabeth Squire was engaged as schoolteacher and she remained in charge until the school closed in 1913. Today it is used as a re-enactment centre for primary school children, and is open to the public during the summer. The building is Grade II* listed by Historic England.  Building  The earliest reference to Sevington School occurs in a census of Wiltshire schools, undertaken in 1859. The recorder describes \\"a very picturesque school and teacher‚Äôs house with boarded floor ‚Äòen parquet‚Äô and wall desks. It is supported by the lord of the manor, who pays the mistress‚Äôs stipend, the school pence being applied to other purposes.\\"Warburton Census of Wiltshire Schools 1859 More than a century later, Nikolaus Pevsner endorsed this judgment, describing the schoolroom as \\"an outstanding example of a very small village school of the mid C19 with original furnishing, edge-grain and wood-block floor and fireplace\\" in his series The Buildings of England.Nikolaus Pevsner: The Buildings of England: Wiltshire The school was built at the height of the Gothic Revival and the architect, James Thomson, seems to have been aiming for a picturesque effect. Thomson had rebuilt the derelict Church of St Margaret of Antioch at nearby Leigh Delamere in 1846, also at Joseph Neeld's expense. Material from the church was incorporated into the school building, including the massive bell tower, doorway arch and 15th century reredos. Today both the schoolroom and schoolhouse are Grade II* listed buildings for their architectural and historical significance, and the unusual floor in the school room continues to attract the interest of visitors.  Teachers  When the school opened in 1849, the first teacher was probably Mary Wilmot. She appears in the 1851 census for Sevington, aged 45 and with the occupation of schoolteacher.United Kingdom Census of 1851 Her son, Nathaniel Wilmot is listed in the school register for 1858. According to local memory, her husband, John Wilmot, a road mender, was also involved with the school. A former pupil, interviewed by the Wiltshire Gazette many years later, describes him as the schoolmaster, adding that \\"We used to pay so much a week and my father always took the money down but I was not there for very long for I left at seven and went bird-scaring, earning a shilling or two a week. I was the eldest of nine and went out early to help the home.\\"Memories of Mr George Wicks recorded in the Wiltshire Gazette, 1935 In 1860 Miss Elisabeth Squire took up the post of schoolmistress, recording in a memorandum written towards the end of her life that \\"I came here in April 1860. 19 years old.\\"Memorandum by Miss Squire, July 1927 She is shown staying with Sarah Westcott, the school mistress of Grittleton House School on the night of the 1861 census. Sarah Westcott was older than Miss Squire, but they both gave their place of origin as Martock, Somerset, so it may be that Mrs Westcott recommended the younger woman to the Neeld family.United Kingdom Census of 1861 The appointment must have been a success as Miss Squire remained in post until 1913, when declining numbers and her advancing years led to the closure of the school. She stayed on in the schoolhouse until her death in 1927. The schoolhouse was then rented out to a series of tenants but the schoolroom remained more or less untouched.  The Victorian experience  The school was built for twenty-two pupils, the sons and daughters of agricultural labourers who worked on the Neeld estates. It seems from the register that most boys had left school by the time they were ten. Even before that, attendance for some families was sporadic with boys taking time off school to earn a little money by pig keeping and bird scaring. Attendance in late July was generally very low, presumably because it was harvest time. In common with many rural schools of the period, girls tended to stay on longer than boys.Gomersell Working-Class Girls in Nineteenth-Century England: Life, Work and Schooling, Macmillan Press 1997 (UK) and St Martin's Press Inc., 1997 (USA), p95-98. Leavers had an opportunity to continue their education by attending the Sunday School which Miss Squire offered to her former pupils. The register shows eleven boys and two girls on her register for 1862. By June, one of the girls was left and was shown as going into service. She was twelve. It is not clear whether the Sunday pupils paid for their schooling but the register shows that day pupils were expected to pay a penny a week. The money went towards oil for the lamps, coal for the schoolroom and supplemented Miss Squire‚Äôs salary. She kept a careful record of who had paid and totted it up at the end of each term. Some families seem to have struggled and certain pupils, often in large family are marked as paying a ha‚Äôpence. Even then, a period of half payment was sometimes followed by a prolonged absence. Former pupils remembered Miss Squire as a tall, vigorous woman who loved her garden and maintained excellent discipline without the need for corporal punishment. By the end of her time there she seems to have been earning ¬£50 a year and living rent free in the school house next door. There was always someone to keep house and chaperone her ‚Äì first her mother, then her niece and finally her sister Hannah. Because Sevington was a private school, there is no logbook or details of the curriculum. It is safe to assume that the education was very basic, with an emphasis on religion, reading, writing and arithmetic. Many of the schoolbooks, maps and charts used by Miss Squire still survive and demonstrate a strong emphasis on the Victorian virtues of piety, thrift, hard work and patriotism. A small collection of samplers showing both functional and decorative work suggests that needlework was an important part of the curriculum for the girls.Sevington collection Sevington School was not state-funded and Miss Squire was spared the visits of Her Majesty‚Äôs inspectors but it is clear that there were regular visits by the Diocesan inspector, who was tasked by the Bishop of Salisbury with assessing the religious knowledge of her pupils. In 1895 he wrote \\"This pleasant little school is being well taught and trained and the children have again passed a very satisfactory Examination in the Elementary Subjects in which they have been instructed.\\"Report by the Diocesan Inspector sevingtonvictorianschool.co.uk  Today  When the school closed in 1913, the contents of the schoolroom were left untouched. Miss Squire‚Äôs reading books, Bibles and sets of psalters were still in the cupboard and the desks and benches, blackboard and pointer remained just where she had left them. Two of the girls‚Äô straw bonnets, donated by the Neeld family, hung on a peg by the door and the inkwells were arranged on the side, awaiting the attention of the ink monitor. In 1987, the owner, Mr Ralph Neeld approached the local education authority to discuss the possibility of renting the property for use as a history resource.Recollections of founder member, Don Williams A charity, the Sevington School Project, was set up in 1991 and signed a 21-year repairing lease. When this expired in 2012, the charity bought the school with the help of a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Today, more than a thousand school children visit the school in the course of each year, to take part in re- enactments of a Victorian school day. The building is open to members of the public in the summer months and attracts many community groups and societies.

He studied with Dick West (Southern Cheyenne) at Bacone College and won numerous national awards for his paintings. He painted in the Flatstyle technique that was taught at Bacone from the 1940s to the 1970s.  Background  David Emmett Williams (Tonkawa name: Tosque) was born on August 20, 1933, in Lawton, Oklahoma, to singer and leather-worker Emmett Williams (Tonkawa/Kiowa Apache) and his Kiowa wife, Jennie Sahkoodlequoie, who was descended of Satanka (Sitting Bear, ca. 1800‚Äì1871). Census records confirm Williams was a full-blood but show his father's heritage was Comanche.  Education  Williams studied at the Indian Art Center in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, under Olle Nordmark and later at Bacone College with fellow Native American painters, Joan Hill (Muscogee/Cherokee) and Doc Tate Nevaquaya (Comanche) under Dick West. Williams did not pursue painting seriously until 1959. Prior to that, he performed as a powwow dancer and singer and worked in a shoe factory. He became serious and passionate about art in the early 1960s and worked in acrylic, gouache, pencil, distemper, and printmaking. All of the artists of this period at Bacone were taught the Bacone style, a Flatstyle painting style, which was often showcased at the Philbrook Museum of Art's Indian Annual, a competitive juried art show. Philbrook and Bacone had an agreement in the 1940s through the 1960s period whereby student's work would be hung and offered for sale, with the school garnering one third of the profits of any sale.  Art career  Williams participated in the annual competitions and was one of the Grand Award winners in the early 1960s. He also won, during the same time frame, the national competition held at the Bismarck National Indian Art Show in Bismarck, North Dakota. In 1961, Williams married Norma Jean Eubanks and the couple moved to Los Angeles. Actor Vincent Price, who was a major collector and advocate of Native American art, purchased 50 of William's paintings to sell through Sears Roebuck's Fine Arts Collection nationwide. William's first solo exhibition was at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, in 1964. That same year, he also did a two-man show with sand painter, David Villasenor, at the Pasadena Public Library. He had other solo shows at the Southern Plains Indian Museum and Craft Center in Anadarko, Oklahoma, the Southwest Museum of the American Indian in Los Angeles and the Tryon Gallery in London. By 1970, the Williams family had decided to move back to Oklahoma and lived in Tahlequah with their two sons. In 1980, Williams designed the centennial logo for Bacone College. By 1981, he mostly stopped painting after losing his eyesight to diabetes. In 1983, he was inducted into the Bacone College Alumni Hall of Fame.  Exhibitions  In 1972, Williams participated in the traveling exhibition, Contemporary Southern Plains Indian Painting, sponsored by the Southern Plains Indian Museum and the Oklahoma Indian Arts and Crafts Co-operative of Anadarko. In 1974, he won the Grand Prize at the Trail of Tears Art Show at the Cherokee Heritage Center. During his lifetime, Williams had multiple and profitable exhibitions throughout the United States including at the Arizona State Museum at the University of Arizona in Tucson; the First Annual National American Indian Art Exposition in Charlotte, North Carolina; the Laguna Gloria Art Museum of Austin, Texas; the McCombs Gallery at Bacone College in Muskogee, Oklahoma; the Owensboro Museum of Fine Art in Owensboro, Kentucky; among many others. He also won awards at the American Indian Exposition of Anadarko and the Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonials in Gallup, New Mexico.  Public collections  Besides in private collections, Williams‚Äô work is part of the permanent collections in museums including the Cherokee Heritage Center in Park Hill, Oklahoma; Gilcrease Museum and the Philbrook Art Museum, both in Tulsa, Oklahoma; the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona; the Southern Plains Indian Museum in Anadarko; and the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles, as well as the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian.

However, this latter extension was titled √öltimes not√≠cies (\\"Latest news\\"), although in later editions it was presented as an independent novel titled El vent de la nit (\\"The wind of the night\\"). Written by a witness of the defeated side, it contains no political message neither leaves an easy partisan exaltation. It reflects a pain that survives any propaganda from two factions: both the novel and poetry squires of the Falange as communist or republican writers  History  The writing of the novel lasted twenty-three years, expanded and worked incessantly. It was first published in September 1956 and extended in successive subsequent editions until the final edition in 1971. The French translation of 1962 contained texts that could not be read in the Catalan version. In October 2014, his English translation was published, under the title Uncertain glory.  Synopsis  The novel is divided into four parts whose backdrop is the Spanish Civil War on the front and the rear of the Republicans. The first two parts use the epistolary form; the first recounts the experiences of young Lieutenant Llu√≠s de Broc√† i de Ruscalleda on the Aragon front; the second, however, takes the point of view of Trini Milmany, the female companion of Llu√≠s, who narrates her experiences in Barcelona. The third and fourth are the memories of the seminarist Cruells, later priest. One of the most important characters in the novel is Juli Soler√†s, but appears only through the vision of the other characters, which one way or another are obsessed with him.  Style  The style is fast and colloquial and reflects the language model of its author, who gave much importance to the spoken Catalan in his time, which took him to accept Spanish barbarism that other contemporaries, such as Joan Coromines, did not accept. However, the virtue of his style is to be direct and simple and also captures the freshness of many authentic expressions, without ceasing to be a literary Catalan, with many philosophical and literary quotations.  Prizes and awards  The novel won the Premi Joanot Martorell in 1955 and received good critical acclaim, starting by its French translationGloire incertaine, Gallimard, 1962, translated by Bernat Lesfargues in 1962, where the book was compared with the work of writers such as Dostoevsky, Georges Bernanos or Julien Green. It is not strange comparison, as Dostoevsky was one of the favorite authors of Sales and therefore dare to make and edit an indirect translation, quite controversial, of The Brothers Karamazov.

He appeared in dozens of telenovelas and television series for more than 40 years. He was the host of the long-running talk show El Show de Rolando Barral, the first Spanish-language talk show in American television. He was often called \\"the Latino Johnny Carson\\". Career Barral, son of Mario Barral, a screenwriter and television director on Cuba, begin his career at age of 9 in Havana in a local radio program. In 1957 he became co- host of Partying with the Heartthrobs, a program which aired on CMQ for five years. In 1962 Barral started his acting career, appearing in several telenovelas and films produced in through Spain, Panama, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and El Salvador. Most notable credits include Mi apellido es Valdez (1957), La otra mujer (1980), Toda una vida (1981) and Guaguasi (1983). In 1978 Barral debuted as television host of long-running talk show El Show de Rolando Barral on WLTV Channel 23, then an affiliate of the Spanish International Network (the predecessor of SIN). In June 1985 the program briefly moved to competitor WSCV (then an independent station), before being lured back five months later. Barral is perhaps best remembered as co- host of SIN's long-running variety show S√°bado Gigante from January to March 1987, when he abruptly moved back to WSCV (which then became a Telemundo affiliate), where he hosted Super S√°bado. In September 1987 he moved back to Channel 23, with Lunes y Viernes with Barral (Mondays and Fridays with Barral). On January 22, 1988 Univision canceled the talk show following Barral's arrest by Coral Gables police on cocaine possession and driving while intoxicated charges. He was fined $964 for the DWI conviction and given a one- year probation for the drug conviction. He returned to airwaves two months later as radio host of El Show on WSUA. Since then he was constantly active as host of TV with Barral on local cable station Hit TV. Rolando Barral died on 21 January 2002 due to a stroke.

During the World War II part of the Galician Germans was moved out in January 1940 in the course of Heim ins Reich, the majority of the rest of them fled later in the years 1944‚Äì1945. History The first wave of ethnic Germans arrived in what would later be known as Galicia in the late Middle Ages (see Ostsiedlung). In part of the region the settlers were known as Walddeutsche.

Another one was established around 1750 in Zalishchyky, which, however, was partially depopulated before 1772. In 1774 Maria Theresa issued a patent aiming to lure German artisans into several local cities, without significant result. The first meaningful settlement campaign took place in the 1780s, the Josephine colonization, which facilitated the arrival of over 3,200 ethnic German families (around 14,400 people).H. Lepucki, 1938, p. 106. Descendants of the Josephine settlers were allowed to establish daughter settlements afterwards (like, for example, Baginsberg in the neighbourhood of Kolomyia, in 1818). Furtherly, smaller settlements took place in the years 1802‚Äì1805 (1,200 families) and 1811‚Äì1848 (400 families).The Settlement of German colonists in Galicia A part of this colonies lost its ethnic German character in the following decades, especially in the western Galicia. More settlements proved to be prolific in the eastern Galicia. In the meantime, the German-speaking population grew slowly in the Galician cities. According to the Austrian census from 1900 there were 212,327 (or 2.7%) German-speaking people in Galicia. Of this number around 80,000 constituted German Christians.Grzegorz Sm√≥lski: Kolonie i stosunki niemieckie w Galicyi, 1910, p. 6 The rest came from part of the Galician Jews (the census did not give the opportunity to declare Yiddish language),H. Lepucki, 1938, p. 141. of whom roughly 20,000 considered themselves German. As a German-speaking was also qualified the population of Wilamowice, traditionally speaking Wymysorys language. After World War I, Galicia became a part of the Second Polish Republic. Many of the colonies retained their previous names, however in the late 1930s the Polish government decided to change them to ones sounding more Polish, e.g. Neudorf to Polminowice.

Life An old abandoned Dutch house in Pulicat It is possible Abraham was born in Haarlem, like his brother Jacobus, also a chaplain, who went to the Indies. The Calvinist Rogerius (anglicized as Roger), studied in Leiden under Antonius Walaeus. His first trip was to Batavia (1631) and then Surat (1632). From 1633 he worked as a chaplain in Pulicat, the capital of Dutch Coromandel. He studied Hinduism in southern India and learned Portuguese. Rogerius authored Open Door to the Secrets of Heathendom, which begins with ten years of ministry among the Tamil people in the Dutch colony of Pulicat near Madras, India.Latourette, 1941, vol. III, p. 277 His knowledge came from three Brahmins whom he met regularly. In 1642 he went back to Batavia and became the manager of an orphanage/school and promoted the use of Portuguese during church services. In 1647 he returned to the Dutch Republic. \\"De Open-Deure tot het verborgen Heydendom ofte Waerachtigh vertoogh van het leven ende zeden, mitsgaders de Religie ende Gotsdienst der Bramines op de Cust Chormandel ende der landen daar ontrent (\\"The open door to the hidden paganism or truthful account of life and customs, as well as religion and worship of the Brahmins at Coromandel Coast and surrounding countries \\"), which was published in Leiden in 1651 and since translated into German (1663), French (1670). This book was one of the first European books describing hinduism. The book has two parts. The first deals with the Brahmins life and customs, while the other describes their faith and worship. Rogerius seems to have been the first published a translation of aphorisms in Sanskrit by Bhart·πõhari, (Hundred aphorisms on the path to heaven by the heathen Bhart·πõhari, famous amongst the Brahmins on the Coromandel coast) which forms the third part of the book.

For more than 25 years her work has been instrumental in developing the conceptual, methodological, and empirical links between health and human rights, with a focus on sexual and reproductive health, HIV and AIDS, child and adolescent health, gender-based violence, non-communicable disease, and health systems. Currently, Gruskin is a Professor at the Keck School of Medicine and Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California. Gruskin also directs the USC Institute for Global Health as well as its Program on Global Health & Human Rights and leads the USC Law & Global Health Collaboration with fellow professors. Gruskin is the co-coordinator of the Rights Oriented Research and Education (RORE) Network in Sexual and Reproductive health, which is an international network of sexual and reproductive health and rights researchers and advocates, as well as a member of the PEPFAR Scientific Advisory Board. She has served on many boards and committees for the World Health Organization, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and other major players in global health.  Early life and education  Gruskin's focus on public health, human rights, and law emerged during the early years of the global AIDS crisis. Gruskin observed that around the world a broad range of rights were being restricted in the name of public health but without proper justification, resulting in widespread violations of rights with devastating health effects. Gruskin received her bachelor's degree in sociology, specializing in Ethnomethodology, from the University of California at Santa Cruz. In 1990, she completed a doctoral degree in jurisprudence at the Cardozo School of Law. Also in 1990, Gruskin participated in an internship at the United States Department of State in the Office of the Legal Advisor. In 1991, Gruskin was admitted to the New York State Bar. In 1993, Gruskin completed a master's degree in International Affairs, specializing in Public Health and Human Rights at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.  Career  Soon after graduate school, Sofia Gruskin came to work with Dr. Jonathan Mann. In association with Dr. Daniel Tarantola, they worked to establish the Fran√ßois- Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University. Gruskin was head of the Harvard School of Public Health‚Äôs program on International Health and Human Rights, chair of the Group on Reproductive Health and Rights at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, associate Professor in the Department of Global Health and Population, and Co-Director of the Inter-departmental Program on Women, Gender and Health. She was at Harvard between 1993 and 2010, and from 2010-2015 was an Adjunct Professor in Global Health at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Gruskin was a member of the Amnesty International board of directors from 2002 to 2006; the principal architect of the 2003 General Comment on HIV/AIDS promulgated by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child; a standing member of the Scientific Review Committee on Behavioral and Social Consequences of HIV/AIDS for the National Institutes of Health from 2005 to 2009; chair of the UNAIDS Reference Group on HIV and Human Rights from 2002-2006; a member of the Institute of Medicine's Committee for the Outcome and Impact Evaluation of Global HIV/AIDS Programs Implemented Under the Lantos/Hyde Act of 2008 (PEPFAR, 2010-2013); a member of the Technical Advisory Group of the UN Global Commission on HIV and the Law from 2010 to 2012; and a member of the Guttmacher Institute's Board of Directors from 2014-2016.

Over the course of her career, Gruskin has partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), IPAS, Open Society Foundation, and local organizations and universities in Brazil, India, and Vietnam, amongst others.  Contribution  The field of health and human rights is now well recognized, and Sofia Gruskin has been a singular figure continuously at the cutting edge of conceptual and programming advances. Gruskin said, \\"We have to recognize that law impacts health and we need to know when law is harming people's lives and when it needs to change.\\" She is known for addressing important questions such as, \\"What should be done to be sure you can access what you need, when you need it, no matter where you are or who you are? How do we best ensure health systems are supportive of the health and human rights of all populations?\\"Sofia Gruskin, Prominent Researcher on Public Health and Law, Joins Keck School of Medicine of USC Office of Public Relations and Marketing, USC. 2011. Accessed May 7, 2015. Gruskin's distinct contribution has been in influencing the direction of public health research and action by defining key concepts, developing and testing conceptual and analytical frameworks, and creating policy and programming tools. Her efforts have been to define, operationalize, and test what is meant by a \\"rights-based\\" approach to health; produce scholarly works to define the conceptual differences between human rights and other frameworks concerned with justice, including ethics and equity; to make clear the distinct contributions human rights offers to health practice including the use of indicators to determine the contribution of human rights to public health effort globally.

It proposed an evolutionary theory of human political orientation. The book theorizes that political leanings are evolutionary adaptations that arise primarily from three clusters of measurable personality traits: tribalism, tolerance of inequality, and perceptions of human nature. As evidence, Our Political Nature synthesizes studies from the fields of political science, genetics, neuroscience, and primatology. The book also offers a psychological explanation for why economic stress tends to broaden the divide between political factions. Reception Chris Mooney in The Washington Monthly credited the book with \\"explaining the now well-documented psychological, biological, and genetic differences between liberals and conservatives with reference to human evolution and the differential strategies of mate choice and resource allocation that have been forced on us by the pressures of surviving and reproducing on a quite dangerous planet.\\" John R. Hibbing in Political Science Quarterly reported that although the book was one of several published at the same time dealing with psychological, biological and evolutionary bases of political beliefs, it \\"makes a unique and important contribution to the field\\" and noted that with regard to its discussion of evolution in the context of politics, \\"as selection pressures are relaxed, it may be possible to push it too far.\\" An unattributed review in The Economist described Tuschman as a biological determinist and said the book did not explain the unpredictability of voters in the middle ground, commenting: \\"the author‚Äôs efforts to use ‚Äúhard science‚Äù to illuminate partisanship often run aground... The political world Mr Tuschman describes tends to be remarkably binary and easily classifiable.\\" In Forbes, Cedric Muhammad noted that the book was generally rejected by conservatives and embraced by liberals, criticized its discussion of ethnocentrism, yet said it makes \\"a compelling case that we are hard-wired to be liberal or conservative by nature, environment and adaptation.\\" Author Avi Tuschman is an American evolutionary anthropologist and author. Tuschman attended high school at Menlo School in California. He attended Stanford University He graduated in 2002 and relocated to Peru for his first job after college. Tuschman later returned to Stanford for a Ph.D. in evolutionary anthropology. In Peru, Tuschman worked as a speech writer and political adviser to President Alejandro Toledo, and served as international projects coordinator for Toledo‚Äôs Global Center for Development and Democracy.

The need for a lighthouse on the island was highlighted in the second maritime lighting plan for the Canaries, and it first became operational in 1933.  Punta de la Orchilla  Punta Orchilla with the lighthouse in the distance Punta de la Orchilla on the south-western side of El Hierro, is a significant location in terms of the Canaries, as it is one of the most westerly points in the archipelago. A meridian memorial close to the lighthouse, is a reminder that historically it was considered to be a prime meridian for early map makers, and was known as the Ferro Meridian, at the western extremity of the known world. The name comes from the Orchil lichen that grows on the rocky lava slopes in the area, inland from the point is a 238 m peak called Orchilla. The isolated locality of the Punta de la Orchilla means that it has been described as \\"probably Spain's most remote lighthouse\\", reaching the site requires a 25 km trip from Sabinosa via a road that is only partly metalled, the end of the road being both unmade, and uneven. Although the site is accessible, the tower and buildings are closed.  History  The lighthouse first entered service in 1933, and was built in a similar style to other earlier Canarian lights, and consists of a whitewashed single storey house, with dark volcanic rock used for the masonry detailing. A plain masonry tower with a substantial base rises from the side of the house facing the Atlantic Ocean. The 25 m high octagonal tower supports twin galleries and a lantern dome, which contains a first order Fresnel lens. With a focal height of 132 m above sea level, its light can be seen for 24 nautical miles. In 2008, Punta Orchilla in conjunction with five other lighthouses was depicted in a set of six commemorative stamps by the Spanish postal service Correos.

Plot In the early 23rd century, an emergency is declared on a mining station O.I. Infini and a search and rescue (SAR) team is sent in using Slipstream, a form of teleportation that allows near instantaneous travel. The location of O.I. Infini is proximal to a number of black holes meaning the mission operatives will experience severe time dilation. A team sent returns 30 seconds later in a berserk rage. Whit Carmichael, a new member of West Coast SAR, on his first day, teleports to Infini using an illegal teleporter after West Coast HQ activates a lethal lock down to contain the crisis. Before leaving for work that day, his wife tells him to do whatever it takes to return safely. Less than a relative hour later, East Coast SAR is informed about the outbreak and the destruction of the West Coast SAR. They are informed a payload of something from the station has been programmed by a deranged survivor to teleport soon to Earth, which will destroy the planet. The SAR is ordered to halt the payload and recover the one surviving member of the West Coast SAR, Whit. Arriving, they find a frozen slaughterhouse, eventually reuniting with Whit, who has had a week to figure out how the station operates. Whit explains that the mining staff slaughtered each other, tearing off their skin and killing one another. Whit is able to shut down the payload, but the deranged survivor suddenly attacks. Everyone is sprayed with the survivor's blood after he is shot and they become violently enraged. Whit hides from the others, then searches the station for remaining SAR personnel and anything he can learn about the infection. Finding a lab, he discovers a medical log that reveals the planet is entirely composed of alien organic material that when thawed forms a so-called \\"primordial ooze\\". It is capable of infecting, mimicking, and finally dominating any biological tissue. He further discovers the ooze is aggressive, predatory in nature, and driven by self-preservation. Suffering mentally from infection, Whit attempts to solicit help from the remaining members of the team, but they are suffering through advanced stages of the infection, which he is resisting better. They either attack each other, kill themselves, or attack Whit. This leaves Whit the last surviving human on the station. He records a message to the ooze which plays on a loop over the loudspeakers, criticizing it for harnessing only the violent instincts of humanity, instead of working with humans. He tells it that it failed and commits suicide. The ooze moves onto the bodies, and they awaken unharmed and no longer crazed, but clearly disturbed by what has happened. They agree to teleport back and keep their story simple. As they begin to teleport, Whit sees several humanoid forms made of ooze, silently watching them go. One of them holds the picture of Whit's wife he carried with him. Returning to Earth, the team is scanned and asked if they are free from biological contaminants. They answer in the affirmative, and the scan clears them all. Whit returns home to his wife, who had been told he was not coming back.  Cast   Production  Shooting began in Sydney in October 2013.  Release  Infini had its international premiere on 11 April 2015 at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival. It was released simultaneously in the US and Australia. The film was not released theatrically in Australia, due to fears of piracy.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 31% of 16 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.73/10. Dov Kornits of the Australian magazine Filmink wrote, \\"Infini is leading the charge in genre filmmaking in this country, proving that we have the chops to compete on the world stage.\\" Commenting on the film's similarity to Aliens, David Stratton of The Australian wrote, \\"Resourcefulness is all very well, but a fresh approach to the familiar cliches would also be appreciated.\\" Harry Windsor of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"a genre retread in search of a plot\\". Andrew Marshall of Starburst rated it 6/10 stars and wrote that the film \\"lacks the follow through to capitalise on its ideas or required sense of humanity to make you actually care\\". Simon Abrams of The Village Voice wrote, \\"Infini doesn't go anywhere that superior science fiction films haven't already, but for a while, it's exciting enough to feel brand- new.\\" Oliver Pfeiffer of SciFiNow rated it 4/5 stars and called it \\"bold, gut- wrenching\\" with the \\"real masterstroke at play...the menacingly immersive production design and deeply atmospheric soundtrack\\". Christopher Webster of Quiet Earth wrote that it \\"feels like an R-rated Twilight Zone episode more than a feature film\\".

Background Heitmeier was born in the Algiers neighborhood, where he still resides. He is divorced. He has two daughters, Leah and Meghan. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1984 from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, then known as the University of Southwestern Louisiana. In 1987, he completed the optometry program at the University of Houston in Houston, Texas. Heitmeier is a volunteer for the Special Olympics and has been affiliated with Goodwill Industries of Southeastern Louisiana, Inc. Political life In the 2007 primary to choose a successor to his brother, the term-limited Senator Francis C. Heitmeier, David Heitmeier nearly won the position outright. He led with 11,010 votes (49.4 percent), just short of the required 50 percent plus one vote. Republican Paul Gerard Richard (born June 1957) followed with 6,904 votes (30.9 percent). The remaining 4,398 ballots (19.7 percent) went to a second Democrat, Jonathan C. Bolar. In the second round of balloting with a lower turnout on November 17, Heitmeier easily prevailed over Richard, 9,496 (62.7 percent) to 5,652 (37.3 percent). He was unopposed for his second term in 2011. Heitmeier maintained a heavy Senate committee load: (1) Health and Welfare (chairman), (2) Environmental Quality, (3) Joint Capital Outlay, (4) Revenue and Fiscal Affairs, (5) Select Coastal Restoration and Flood Control, (6) Select Hurricane Recovery Committee, (7) Select Veterans Affairs, and (8) Transportation, Highways and Public Works.

Overview After marijuana was legalized in different parts of the United States, longtime activist Willie Nelson announced in 2015 through spokesman Michael Bowman the establishment of his own marijuana brand, Willie's Reserve. Plans to open chain stores in the states where marijuana was legalized were announced, to be expanded state-to-state if marijuana legalization is further expanded. Bowman called the brand \\"a culmination of (Nelson's) vision, and his whole life\\". Bowman compared the concept of Willie's Reserve to Whole Foods Market, with the stores planned to carry their own brand of marijuana, while also featuring products by local growers. During an interview with Rolling Stone Nelson explained that the stores would feature a \\"menu\\" explaining the effects produced by each type of product sold in the store, while he emphasized that the chain would closely cooperate with other growers. The opening of the chain was announced for 2016 with locations starting in Alaska, Colorado and Washington, with an expansion planned as marijuana becomes legal in other states.

The race was cancelled the day before it was scheduled to take place because of a suspected terrorist plot similar to the Boston Marathon bombing.  Planned event  The race was to have taken place on 1 May 2015 and was rated as a 1.HC event by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI).

The couple arrested were identified as Halil D., 35, a German citizen of Turkish origin, and Senay D., 34, thought to be a Turkish citizen. Various items were found in their house, including a homemade pipe bomb, bomb-making materials, an automatic rifle, bazooka ammunition and a canister full of petrol. One of the couple had apparently bought hydrogen peroxide and alcohol at a hardware shop and had been seen exploring a forest along the race route. He had connections to Salafists in Frankfurt, including the group Dawa FFM. The German newspaper Die Welt suggested that he was involved with Al-Qaida, specifically Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).

It has also been suggested that there may have been connections to Adem Yilmaz, one of those convicted as part of a bomb plot in 2007. Security officials suggested that the couple may have been planning an attack similar to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.

Biography James Henry Ward was born in 1854 in Quincy, Massachusetts, as the second of seven children in a family of Irish immigrants. He first enlisted at the age of 22, leaving behind a job as a bricklayer. After enlisting in Boston on August 3, 1876, he was assigned to the 5th Cavalry stationed at Fort Laramie. Ward returned to civilian life in 1881 after five years of 'excellent' service before enlisting again in New York City in 1883, this time with the 7th Cavalry. This second enlistment again ended with an 'excellent' service record, and Ward quickly followed it with a final enlistment in Boston in 1888, this time with the 4th Cavalry. Battle of Wounded Knee and Medal of Honor Partway through his third enlistment Ward transferred back to the 7th Cavalry, which was deployed on the Pine Ridge Campaign in South Dakota to suppress followers of the Ghost Dance. On December 28, 1890, 7th Cavalry detained several hundred Lakota near Wounded Knee. American soldiers were sent into the Lakota prisoner camp to disarm tribal warriors the next morning. A small scuffle over a rifle quickly escalated to fighting throughout the camp. Tasked with taking weapons from the Lakota, Ward was knocked to the ground and then stabbed several times with a knife during the first few moments of fighting. Ward's assailant was killed by another soldier, enabling Ward to survive the initial melee and participate in the massacre. The 7th Cavalry killed at least 200 men, women and children in encounters ranging from hand- to-hand melees to artillery fire. Along with 19 other soldiers present at the massacre, Ward was awarded a Medal of Honor. Ward's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > Continued to fight after being severely wounded. Later life Ward was discharged from the Army before completing his final five-year enlistment and returned to Boston where he took a job as a steamfitter. Ward married Catherine Harrington in 1894 in Boston and had a son in 1898. Suffering from paralysis, Ward was admitted to the Boston Insane Hospital where he died two years later in 1901. Ward is buried at New Cavalry Cemetery in Mattapan, a neighborhood in southern Boston.

It has had very little research done about its effects and metabolism, and has been sold online as a designer drug. The synthesis of clonazolam was first reported in 1971 and the drug was described as the most active compound in the series tested. Clonazolam is reported to be highly potent, and concerns have been raised that clonazolam and flubromazolam in particular may pose comparatively higher risks than other designer benzodiazepines, due to their ability to produce strong sedation and amnesia at oral doses of as little as 0.5 mg. Legality  United Kingdom  In the UK, clonazolam has been classified as a Class C drug by the May 2017 amendment to The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 along with several other designer benzodiazepine drugs.  United States  Virginia State Law has declared all of the following are now schedule I: clonazolam, etizolam, flualprazolam, flubromazolam, and flubromazepam.  Sweden  Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying clonazolam as a hazardous substance on June 1, 2015. Effects Clonazolam's effects are similar to other benzodiazepines, such as anxiolysis, disinhibition, lethargy, muscle relaxation, and euphoria. While no dose of clonazolam is considered \\"safe\\" due to its lack of research and extreme potency, doses higher than 0.5 mg can cause benzodiazepine overdose in some individuals. The effects of a benzodiazepine overdose include sedation, confusion, insufficient breathing, loss of consciousness, and death. Because dependence can occur in a short period of time, or even with a large initial dose, withdrawal symptoms may occur acutely, following the period of intoxication. These include seizures and can result in death.

He served for years as one of Raymond L. S. Patriarca's lieutenants, and also headed his own faction of the Patriarca mob.  Early life  Ouimette was born on March 6, 1940, in Providence, Rhode Island. His parents were both of French descent. His father worked as the Governor of Rhode Island's chauffeur. He had to resign when he contracted tuberculosis, which is contagious, and found work as a taxicab driver. As his illness progressed, he eventually had to go live in a sanatorium. The family would visit him there once a month, followed by routine exams to make sure they did not contract the disease. His father died in 1948, when Ouimette was seven. After his father's death, Ouimette's mother struggled to raise him and his eight siblings. During that time, Catholic nuns provided emotional and material support for the Ouimette family, bringing them food and clothing and checking in nearly every day. Soon, they were forced to move from their middle-class neighborhood to the poorer Federal Hill area.  Criminal background  Ouimette's criminal activities began in the 1950s. After his father died, he and his brother would shoplift to make some money. His first court appearance came when he was ten, when he was charged with criminal possession of a firearm. He was arrested in an alley, holding a gun, which he claimed he picked up after it was dropped by a man fleeing law enforcement. Nevertheless, his mother could not afford an attorney, and he was sent to the Sockanosset School for Boys, a reformatory in Cranston, Rhode Island. There, after several fights with other boys, some school teachers took him around to boxing clubs to perform. After ten months, he was allowed to return home. In 1956, when Ouimette was 16 years old, he was given a series of psychological tests. The psychiatrist who conducted them concluded: > It seems likely that, because of the nature of this boy's problems, and > because of the lack of acceptable moral principles, he will indulge in > delinquent behavior again. In the late 1950s, he did a stint of service in the US Army. In 1959, two months after turning 18, he was sentenced to six years in prison for robbing, at gunpoint, a South Providence jewelry store. During his third year in prison, his two oldest brothers, Alvin and Billy, both in their 20s, died in a construction accident. A few months later, he was granted parole, and moved in with his mother in East Providence. Soon after, he was sent back to prison for a parole violation.  Mob career   1960s  Ouimette first met mob boss Raymond L. S. Patriarca in the mid-1960s, when a friend brought him around to Patriarca's cigarette store, his mob headquarters. Soon after, he carried out his first task for Patriarca: acquiring stolen Cadillacs. His mob activities only escalated thereafter. On January 24, 1969, Ouimette and his brother John were arrested on charges that they shot a Pennsylvanian mob hitman outside a Cranston restaurant. At that time, Ouimette was already serving a five-year sentence for possession of a gun after a crime of violence. The brothers were ultimately acquitted after the victim told the jury that the Ouimettes were not the ones that shot him. The 1960s also saw Ouimette gain his famous nickname \\"The Frenchman.\\" It may have originated in the Ouimette's unique ancestry in a mostly-Italian American mob. Ouimette himself credited police with the name, writing in his 2012 memoir: > 'The Frenchman' is the name that Rhode Island police attached to me in 1969 > since I am proud of my French descent, an anomaly in that neighborhood. Due > to ensuing notoriety, the name stuck.  1970s  On July 9, 1972, while still in prison on the gun possession charge, Ouimette was convicted of conspiracy to kill Michael Greene and Homer Perkins, career criminals who had been found murdered three years prior. He was sentenced to ten years in prison, and was sent to the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), a maximum security facility in Cranston. There, operating out of the prison's North State Wing, where the mafiosos lived, Ouimette continued to lead his gang from behind bars, and had enormous influence and freedom within the prison. There, he even had influence over the warden. According to state police, he essentially \\"ran the place.\\" Patriarca was in and out of prison, and Ouimette served as his second-in-command at the ACI, which they used as a recruiting ground for the mob. Ouimette had a telephone installed in his cell, which was supposed to be used for his work with National Prisoners' Reform Association, but in reality was used to continue managing his organized crime from within the prison. In March 1977, Ouimette called Vincent Vespia, a state police detective sergeant, at his home and threatened to break his jaw. Vespia got dressed, drove to the prison and ripped the phone from the wall. Vespia said, \\"I was incensed that he had a phone. He had no reaction. What was he going to say? I think he was surprised to see me.\\" Ouimette was convicted for threatening Vespia and was sentenced to an extra 36 days, though the conviction was later overturned on appeal. Every week, Charles Kennedy, a member of his gang, would smuggle in $500 to $600 worth of canned hams, cold cuts, cheese, Italian bread, marijuana, and alcohol for Ouimette and his gang. The situation was such that Kennedy would walk past the front guard desk, with no questions asked, and corrections officers would deliver the food directly to Ouimette's first floor cell. Once, Kennedy was arrested by state police for attempting to deliver Ouimette a case of 46-ounce soda cans that had been emptied, filled with whiskey, and then resealed. Besides Ouimette, there were other members of his crew in the north wing, including his brother John, Chuckie Flynn, a mobster from Lowell, Massachusetts, and two convicted killers, Ronnie Sweet and Maurice Lerner, a Massachusetts native and mob hitman who was once a professional baseball player. Ouimette and his gang would walk to a second-floor lawyer's meeting room and get drunk on smuggled alcohol in styrofoam cups. One time, he had his five-year-old son smuggled into his cell for a sleepover, state police said. John Gotti, boss of the Gambino crime family and a close friend, would sometimes come to visit him. Well-noted were the catered lobster dinners Ouimette and his crew often enjoyed. William Kunstler, the lawyer and civil rights activist, once joined them for one of these occasions (Kunstler had once defended him in court). A photo of one of that dinner, published in The Providence Journal, was captioned thus: > This extraordinary photograph of a lavish mob dinner inside the maximum > security unit of the Adult Correctional Institutions was taken sometime in > the 1970s. It's unclear who shot the photo, how the food was brought inside > the prison, or why radical civil rights lawyer William Kunstler was allowed > to travel unescorted inside the prison. Due to a reduced sentence, Ouimette was released from prison on 29 October 1977. However, he was rumored to be a \\"marked man\\" by rival organized crime groups, placing his life in danger upon his release. A source speaking to the Associated Press said that Ouimette was targeted for execution while in prison, but was never \\"hit.\\" The source explained that the reason was because some mob leaders believed Ouimette had a tendency to get \\"too big for his britches.\\" One Providence Journal reporter even prepared an obituary, convinced Ouimette would be killed. Ultimately, nothing came of it and he was never harmed. Ouimette's position within the mob was secure, even after five years in prison. In 1977, Gerald McDowell, the head of the US Department of Justice's Boston-based Organized Crime Strike Force, told a gathering of local businessmen that Rhode Island organized crime is controlled by two men, one in \\"Federal Hill,\\" (Raymond Patriarca), and the other \\"in the ACI\\" (Ouimette). State police detective Captain Brian Andrews described Ouimette as the \\"Prince of Atwells Avenue,\\" the stronghold of organized crime in New England. Ouimette was not a made member of the mob because he was not Italian, but an FBI report from April 16, 1979, reported that he was the leader of a non-Italian faction within the Patriarca crime family: > Subject OUIMETTE controls a large group of criminals known as the OUIMETTE > faction, whose criminal activities include gambling, loansharking, extortion > and property violations such as major hijackings, robberies and burglaries. > Although not Italian, OUIMETTE enjoys the same stature as lieutenants under > RAYMOND L.S. PATRIARCA, who controls organized crime (OC) in the Boston and > New England area. The document also said that federal authorities believed Ouimette was responsible \\"for seven or eight gangland-style murders.\\" Despite this, Ouimette was never convicted of murder, but he was regularly a suspect in mob killings in Rhode Island and the rest of New England. He was acquitted twice of murder and attempted murder charges in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts.  1980s  In 1980, Ouimette had a falling-out with Charles Kennedy, one of his enforcers. Kennedy claimed Ouimette told him, \\"You want to be your own fucking guy? Let's see how long you last,\\" and organized a hit squad to kill him. Around the same time, Vincent Vespia, the state police detective, also claimed that Ouimette had a contract out to kill him. Ultimately, neither Kennedy nor Vespia were harmed. In 1981, Ouimette was charged with the murder of John Barbieri, an East Greenwich businessman with mafia tied whose body was found in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, with a bullet in the back of the head. He was acquitted. A year later, he and three other men were arrested for assaulting Douglas Gomes, an ex-convict, at a caf√© in Providence. Police said that Ouimette dropped a .38 caliber revolver on the floor when he saw them. The weapon had an obliterated serial number. In February 1984, he was convicted of weapons charges and sentenced to 18 years in federal prison.  1995 extortion trial  Ouimette was released on parole on October 28, 1994, and moved to Fall River, Massachusetts, but was tracked daily by local, state, and federal law enforcement. Less than five months later, Ouimette was arrested yet again, charged with having extorted $125,000 from Paul A. Calenda, a Cranston restaurant owner, and for attempting to extort $5,000 from Providence car dealer and mob associate David Duxbury. Ouimette was charged alongside fellow mobster Robert P. Deluca Sr. At the trial future U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse represented the government as prosecuting attorney. Ouimette was the first criminal from New England to be prosecuted by Whitehouse as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island. At trial, the federal government presented evidence that in early 1995, Ouimette was involved in two acts of extortion: the first involved efforts to collect a loan made to Paul Calenda and the second was an attempt to receive money from David Duxbury. The government presented as evidence several recorded conversations in which Ouimette threatened to commit violence against Calenda. As Whitehouse put it: \\"A couple of Rhode Islanders were told that they would need to pay money and if they didn't they would be hurt fairly severely.\\" In addition to the recordings, a variety of witnesses, including some of Ouimette's former mob associates, showed up to testify. The case involving Calenda included testimony from Paul Copolla, who claimed to have overheard a conversation between Ouimette and Calenda in which Ouimette demanded a payment of $125,000 and threatened to commit a variety of violent acts against Calenda. James Gellerman, an alleged co-conspirator in the Calenda crime, plead guilty and agreed to cooperate with the government. He testified that one time at St. Rocco's Club in Providence in February 1995, Ouimette had instructed him to \\"crack\\" Calenda to get him to repay the alleged loan, and that Paul Parenteau was present for this conversation. The government's Duxbury case relied exclusively on testimonial evidence. These witnesses included Duxbury, Gellerman, the widow of a mobster whom Ouimette had an affair with, and strippers from the Satin Doll nightclub in Providence. Gellerman and Duxbury both testified that Ouimette had assaulted Duxbury one night at the Satin Doll and demanded he pay a sum of $5,000 by the next day. Gellerman further testified that the next day, Ouimette had met with him at a restaurant and instructed him to go to Duxbury's car dealership, along with Parenteau and Harry Drew, so the three men could collect the money. Gellerman said that Parenteau and Drew were also present at the restaurant when this conversation took place. In addition, several strippers who worked at the Satin Doll were called to the witness stand to testify regarding Ouimette's assaults and threats against Duxbury at the strip club. Ouimette struck an intimidating presence in the courtroom, and when he rose from his chair at one point during the testimony, the strippers became so fearful that they broke into tears and refused to even look in his direction. In autumn 1995, Ouimette and Deluca were convicted on both counts of extortion. At the sentencing on February 1, 1996, U.S. District Judge sErnest C. Torres said, \\"There is no suspense left here,\\" and sentence Ouimette to life imprisonment without parole. Ouimette was the first criminal in New England, and the fourth in the United States, to be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, the mandated sentence for criminals convicted of three or more violent offenses under the \\"three strikes and you're out\\" provision of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. Deluca was sentenced to 10.5 years for his role. At the sentencing, Ouimette briefly addressed the court, criticizing the federal government for relying on paid witnesses to make its case. He claimed prosecutors had abused the system, saying, \\"As long as there are abuses, people like me are going to get hurt. That's all I have to say.\\" He was then handcuffed and escorted from the courtroom by armed federal marshals. He appealed the decision, but the appeal was rejected.  Death  Ouimette died on April 19, 2015, aged 75, at the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North Carolina, a medium-security prison where he had spent the previous 19 years. He died in his sleep 10 days after being diagnosed with lung cancer. He had also suffered from heart disease and other health issues. His death was confirmed by Rhode Island State Police Colonial Steven O'Donnell, who called Ouimette \\"one of the most notorious villains Rhode Island has ever known.\\" His body was sent back to Rhode Island for a funeral and burial. Ouimette had more than ten criminal convictions in his life, including one for punching an FBI agent. He had spent 46 years of his life in prison, from Adult Correctional Institutions in Rhode Island to federal prisons, including the Lewisburg Penitentiary in Pennsylvania and the Marion Penitentiary in Illinois. At the time of his death, he was working to appeal his last conviction.  Personal life  At 24, shortly after his release from his first prison sentence, Ouimette impregnated a local girl, Frances Gravelle. He told her marriage was not an option given his lack of employment, and the couple would not consider abortion because they were Catholic. Instead, Gravelle planned to raise their boy as a single mother and Ouimette gave her some money. Ouimette was raised Catholic but stopped believing in God after his two brothers died in a construction accident.  Works  * What Price Providence?

They are usually constructed with the hope that they can soon be redeveloped into a larger building capable of generating more revenue, or simply to hold a parcel of land along a new road or especially a streetcar line while waiting for value to appreciate. The building style was generally replaced with strip malls as the automobile became dominant in the mid 20th Century. History In the wake of the Great Depression, taxpayers proliferated across New York City, ending the period of high-rise buildings; while just 7 percent of building plans filed in 1929 for the busy 3rd, Lexington, and Madison Avenues were for one- to three-story buildings, every plan was for such a building by 1933. Despite being intended as temporary buildings, many survived for a half-century or more.  Hazards  Taxpayer buildings are criticized for being poorly or cheaply built, but allow a developer to stay in business while they wait for more favorable conditions. A fire in a taxpayer is a special hazard in firefighting. The poor quality construction often burns readily, and the architecture tends to encourage backdrafts. Many have been renovated several times over and have concealed or undocumented voids. More modern taxpayers were built with fire-resistant materials and are less of a hazard.

He founded Hong Kong Reporter in 2004, an internet radio station focused on live talk radio broadcasting. In 2013 he founded memehk.com, a multimedia news site, after Hong Kong Reporter was closed. Early life Born to a middle- class family in Hong Kong, Shiu is the third of six children. His father Pak- yin Shiu was an overseas Chinese construction materials businessman. Shiu studied at St. Paul's College, Hong Kong and was classmates with Tsang Tak- sing, former Secretary for Home Affairs. He studied History at the University of Hong Kong following his A-levels. He began studying for a master's degree in History but dropped out. Career In 1987, Shiu began collaborating with Wong Yuk-long in creating popular comics such as Zui Quan (ÈÜâÊã≥) and Oriental Heroes (ÈæçËôéÈñÄ), on which films Drunken Master and Dragon Tiger Gate were based, respectively. In 2003 Shiu acquired Rainbow International Ltd (ÂΩ©ËôπÂúãÈöõ) and changed its name to ËÆäÈùöDÊéßËÇ° Ltd, a body slimming company. He founded Hong Kong Reporter (È¶ôÊ∏Ø‰∫∫Á∂≤) in 2004. In recent years, it became a podium for radical ideas and helped garner support for political party People Power, including its protests and activities. Shiu is a screenwriter and film producer whose works include 1992 Hong Kong Film Awards winner To Be Number One. After the handover, Shiu was a co-host on a Metro Radio current affairs programme before starting up his own stations online. In 2013 Shiu announced that he is to launch a new radio station, weeks after having closed one of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy radio stations. Memehk.com was inaugurated shortly after. Political activism Shiu is an outspoken supporter of the Occupy Central with Love and Peace group, a pro-democracy, civil rights advocacy group that organised the 2014 Hong Kong protests. In May 2012 he announced that he would close Hong Kong Reporter if People Power failed to win at least 3 seats in the city's Legislative Council. In an interview he stated that 'Hong Kong is in grave danger', and that the Council needed enough opposition voices to counter Chief Executive-elect Leung Chun-ying. At a People Power hustings in June 2012 he declared his candidacy for the Hong Kong Island geographical constituency. On 22 March 2013 he announced in his own radio programme that Hong Kong Reporter would cease production, citing his 'disappointment' in many of his former political allies and partners. He made it clear that he has withdrawn support for People Power, and would not support any other political party from that day forth. He founded the purportedly politically unaffiliated memehk.com as its replacement on 1 June 2013. On 24 November 2014, one day after delivering a speech to the crowd at the 2014 Hong Kong protests, Shiu's vehicle was forcibly stopped by two cars, causing damage to his vehicle. He was not injured as a result of the incident. He believed the attack was in retaliation to his comments and news reports by his own outlet memehk.com, stating 'only criminal gangs are capable of [such acts]'. Controversy In 2003 Shiu was alleged to have been involved in a pyramid scheme. The company he co-created was accused of selling electronic currency to its customers, who later discovered they were unable to purchase goods at market value with said currency. On 18 July 2011, Shiu announced his intention to acquire Hong Kong Golden Forum, a popular internet forum, and to merge it with Hong Kong Reporter. This was met with vocal opposition from the forum's users, some of whom created a number of parodies with profanities. During the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, as seen in video footage widely shared online, a man was doused in flammable liquid and set on fire by a protester in Ma On Shan. In response, Shui made misleading comments to argue that the video was faked, but his statement was quickly debunked as false afterwards. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority and the Hong Kong Police Force both confirmed that the incident had happened and that the victim remained in a critical condition. Shui has since retracted his comments and issued an apology.

Set in first century Egypt, the book is a biography of Cleopatra VII Philopator from age 10 to 22. Cleopatra faced rivalry between sisters, her father's exile, arrogant brothers, Julius Caesar, and a lot more. This book is recommended for ages 12 and up. Main characters * Cleopatra VII Philopator (Cleopatra) * Ptolemy XII Auletes, Cleopatra's father * Charmion, a fictional dancer * Julius Caesar * Tryphaena and Berenike, Cleopatra's belligerent older sisters * Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator, Cleopatra's co-ruler and second youngest brother Reception Critical reception has been mixed. Cleopatra Confesses has received editorial reviews from Publishers Weekly, School Library Journal, Booklist, Library Media Connection, Children's Literature, Kirkus Reviews, and VOYA Magazine. Publishers Weekly criticized that the \\"short chapters can occasionally make the narrative feel choppy\\", but praised that the prose was \\"lush\\" and \\"detail- rich\\". School Library Journal described the novel as \\"appealing, well-paced, informative\\" and with \\"a rich assortment of characters, places, and events\\". VOYA Magazine described the plot as \\"engaging\\", \\"plausible\\", and \\"well- crafted\\", and recommended the novel for \\"fans of historical fiction dealing with ancient Egypt and those who have a particular interest in one of the world‚Äôs most fascinating female leaders\\". VOYA also recommended this book as \\"an introduction to historical fiction for book clubs\\" and as \\"a read-aloud to introduce students in social studies classes to the time period\\". Booklist commented that \\"the through details...occasionally threaten to overwhelm the story\\". Library Media Connection submitted a recommended review. Children's Literature noted that \\"this book will definitely appeal to historical fiction fans\\", and \\"readers looking for a strong woman role model will be thoroughly entertained\\". Kirkus Reviews described the first-person account as \\"mildly compelling\\", and criticized that \\"The occasionally vivid voice of an intelligent young woman lapses into uncharacteristic moments of denseness (as she fails to heed advice she's just given herself) or starchy historical or cultural explanations for the readers' benefit, often inserted into conversation\\". Kirkus stated that \\"the narrative arc lags under the inconsistent voice\\", and \\"readers who hungry purely for lots of effective detail of an ancient culture, time and place may find this a digestible-enough vehicle for it, with oodles of backmatter for support\\".

The hospital is one of five private upscale hospitals in the city; the others being International Hospital Kampala in Namuwongo, Paragon Hospital in Bugoloobi, Case Medical Centre in Kampala Central Division and Kampala Hospital in Kololo. Location The address of the hospital is 14A Akii Bua Road, Nakasero Hill, Kampala. It is located on Nakasero Hill, in Kampala Central Division, immediately north of the city's central business district. The coordinates of the hospital are 0¬∞19'37.0\\"N, 32¬∞34'46.0\\"E (Latitude:0.326944; Longitude:32.579444). Overview The hospital is a private upscale hospital; one of the five most exclusive private healthcare facilities in Kampala, Uganda's capital. Those hospitals have been established over the last 20 years, beginning with International Hospital Kampala in 1996, to address the gap in specialized tertiary healthcare delivery in the country and to serve that segment of Uganda's population that has been seeking the missing services from outside Uganda. After disagreements with the Uganda Insurers Association, an industry group, Nakasero Hospital established Nakasero HealthCare Limited, one of the only two hospital-owned health maintenance organizations in Uganda. History NHL opened its outpatient's department in March 2009 and the inpatient wards were opened in July 2009. The privately owned hospital is the brainchild of about 20 medical doctors, the majority of whom are specialist, from inside and outside Uganda, who pooled their resources and invested in the hospital. In 2010, the hospital borrowed US$3 million in Uganda currency denomination, from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an arm of the World Bank, to \\"increase access to quality health care, create jobs for medical professionals, and introduce new standards of clinical and patient care in the country\\". In April 2015, the hospital began a public fundraising drive to construct \\"Nakasero Fistula Centre\\", where women who have undergone repair of obstetric fistula, can recuperate while they heal, before they can return to their homes and families. Expansion In June 2019, at the occasion of marking the 10th anniversary of the founding of the hospital, Dr. Edward Rukwaro, the hospital's chief executive officer, announced that the hospital was about to undergo major renovations and expansion, to the tune of US$10 million. The expansion will create new departments of (a) Cardiology (b) Gynecology (focusing on In vitro fertilisation) (c) Orthopedic surgery (including spine and joint surgery) and (d) Pediatrics.

It is observed that the off- chip data bus consumes between 9.8% and 23.2% of the total power consumed by the system depending on the system. So, reducing the power consumption of the off-chip data bus would reduce the overall power consumption.  Introduction  Off-chip buses are associated with higher capacitance values internal node capacitances and hence, therefore techniques for minimizing switching at external address and data buses, even at the expense of a slight increase in switching at internal capacitances are quite useful. Off chip power consumption can be reduced by at least these two techniques: by reducing the number of bus lines activated during data transfer and by reducing the number of bit transitions on the active bus lines. A mix of both of these techniques produce optimal result. Value cache encoding is a scheme which is used to reduce power consumption in off chip data bus. In this scheme, Cache at both side of data bus is used to reduce the dynamic power dissipation on off-chip data buses. These caches are maintained such that their contents are the same all the time.  Scheme Details  In this protocol, we employ a small cache (called value cache, or VC for short) at each side of the off-chip data bus. These value caches keep track of the data values that have recently been transmitted over the bus. The entries in these caches are constructed in such a way that the contents of both the value caches are the same all the time. When a data value needs to be transmitted over the bus, we first check whether it is in the value cache of the sender (whether it is memory or cache). If it is, we transmit only the index of the data (i.e., its value cache address, or index) instead of the actual data value and, the other side (receiver) can determine the data value by using this index and its value cache. To transmit the data in the value cache using only 1 bit switching activity, the size of value cache is limited to the width of the data bus. That is, with a 32-bit bus, the VC could have only 32 entries. Since the value caches employed by our power protocol are very small, the width of the index value is much smaller than the width of the actual data value. Consequently, fewer off- chip bus lines need to be activated for transmission Our approach tries to achieve the first option by exploiting the locality of the data values communicated over the off-chip data bus. However, once the width of the data (that needs to be transmitted) has been reduced, we can also expect a reduction (in general) on the average bit switching activity per transfer. In addition, this switching activity can be further reduced by using well-known bus encoding schemes in conjunction with our strategy  Cache Consistency  The receiver side runs the same placement and replacement policy for the VC as the sender. Thus, the value of the data sent over the bus is copied in the receiver VC at the same index location, as in the sender VC. We use one extra control bit to indicate whether the data being sent over the bus is the verbatim data or an index to the VC. A memory-write activity is handled in a similar fashion.  Example  We assume that initially the values 100 and 200 are not present in the VC. During Transaction #1, A is sent from the memory to the cache. The requested data item, stored at some address (say address X of the memory) has a value 100. The memory controller searches the VC for the value 100 and detects a miss. Therefore, the value 100 is sent over the off-chip data bus. Also, following our power protocol, the value 100 is stored at the same location (say 5) of the VCs of both the source and the destination. For Transaction #2, the memory controller searches for the value 200, cannot find the value in the VC, and repeats the steps as described above. At this point the value caches at the both ends contain data values 100 and 200. In Transaction #3, the memory controller finds that a value 100 has to be sent to serve a read request (of the same memory location as before, or of a different memory location that has the same value). But, note that the value 100 is already present in the VC of the sender in location 5 as a result of Transaction #1. Therefore, instead of sending the value 100, the memory controller just sends the index value 5. The receiver, on the other hand, fetches the value of the actual data (100 in this case) from location 5 of its VC. Finally, in Transaction #4, we want to send the data item D having a value 200 to the memory (i.e., a write request). But, the value 200 is already cached in both the VCs as a result of Transaction #2 from memory to cache. Consequently, the index to the cached copy (present in the VC) of value 200 is used to complete Transaction #4 but in the reverse direction. This last transaction shows that, the data placed in the VCs during a transaction in one direction can be re-used (from the VC) during a transaction in the reverse direction.  Replacement Policy  LRU is used as replacement policy in both caches. It is implemented using reference bit and a n-bit time stamp for each value stored in cache. When a value appears in input, reference bit is set. At regular intervals, the reference bit is shifted right into the high-order bit position of the n-bit timestamp causing all bits in the timestamp also to be shifted right and the lowest-order bit in the timestamp being discarded. For example, timestamp 000 means this value did not appear during the last three time intervals, timestamp 100 means it was just seen in the last interval, and the timestamp 000 with reference bit set means it is encountered in the current time slot. Operation mentioned above is performed on all entries of both caches with all reference bits reset. Thus, the timestamp keeps the history of value occurrences for the last n time periods. When an entry is required and a value is to be evicted, the entry that is selected is the one with the smallest timestamp and clear reference bit. The new value is put in with a fresh reference bit and timestamp (all 0's) in this selected entry.  Type of Value Cache  After describing the protocol, we will now see two approaches for maintaining cache : # Both caches can be initialized using fixed set of values depending on frequency of appearance of values in previous run. # A changing set of frequent values can be maintained as the program runs. Thus, the contents of the frequent value tables adapt to changes in the frequent values for different parts of execution. The advantage of filling cache with fixed value is that the coders do not have to change the contents of the table dynamically thus reducing the runtime overhead. However, it requires that values be known before hand and different program needs different values. The second method, on the other hand, does not need a priori information of data values and does not distinguish among different programs. With these features, we pay the price of identifying the frequent values on the fly.  Other Application  The protocol we discussed was applied on bus whose one end is on-chip cache and other end was off-chip memory, it is possible to adapt our strategy to work with an off-chip L2 cache as well. In addition, power protocol can also be used to reduce the switching activity between on-chip L1 cache and on-chip L2 cache (although the results would not be as good as those with the off-chip bus). In fact, our strategy can be used between any two communicating devices in the system (with the VC support). Further, we are not restricted by point-to-point configurations. That is, our approach can be made to work in an environment where multiple devices are communicating over a shared (power-hungry) data bus. Obviously, in this case, among other things, we would need a coherence mechanism (the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this paper). A drawback of our strategy is the extra space needed by two value caches (one on-chip and the other off-chip). In this paper, we do not present a detailed study of the circuit space implications of our approach. As will be presented in the experimental results section, even a small VC (128 entries) generates reasonably good energy behavior; so, we can expect that the space overhead due to our optimization will not be excessive.

There the local politician and publicist Ture Malmgren (1851‚Äì1922) began building his grand Tureborg Castle, today a ruin, in 1899. Along its slopes Malmgren constructed several other structures, among them the likewise faux-medieval summer residence Fj√§llhyddan, and his own would-be tomb. The area was once completely barren, but Malmgren ‚Äì who was engaged in the tree-planting movement of that time ‚Äì promised his wife Hilma that she would one day be able to walk beneath trees on Fj√§lls√§tern, and set about planting the thick forest of today. A nature reserve named after him, Ture Valleys, is situated on the mountain's eastern side. During the Second World War, Fj√§lls√§tern was used by the Swedish Armed Forces for the town's air defence, as a lookout post.

The measure's approval would have caused one constitutional amendment and 10 statutes to go into effect. It is estimated that Proposal 1 would raise state revenues from sales and use taxes by $1.427 billion, fuel taxes by $463 million, truck registration fees by $50 million, and vehicle registration fees by $10.1 million in the first year. If approved, the proposal would have resulted in average tax increase of $545 per household in 2016, according to an estimate by the Associated Press. The proposal was defeated in an historically lopsided statewide election, receiving support from only 20% of voters. History Proposal 1, consisting of House Joint Resolution UU of 2014 and associated bills, was passed on the last day of the 97th Legislature of Michigan, December 19, 2014. The legislation was created as a solution to a legislative impasse on road funding, with the state House and Senate unable to agree on legislation to create new funding for Michigan roads. Both the House- and Senate-approved plans would have allocated an additional approximately $1.2 billion annually for road and bridge maintenance. The House-approved plan would have allocated this money by cutting spending increases in other areas, including schools. The Senate-approved plan would have raised the money through higher fuel taxes. The two chambers unable to compromise, both plans were discarded in favor of Proposal 1. House Joint Resolution UU was passed with the requisite supermajority vote in either chamber, and ten additional bills were passed and signed into law containing enacting clauses that stipulate they only take effect if HJR UU is adopted by voters. Text Proposal 1 consists of an amendment to the Michigan Constitution of 1963, House Joint Resolution UU of 2014. Separately from the constitutional amendment, Public Acts 467 through 476 of 2014, signed into law by Governor Rick Snyder in January 2015, contain enacting sections that specify they do not take effect \\"unless House Joint Resolution UU of the 97th Legislature becomes a part of the state constitution of 1963 as provided in section 1 of article XII of the state constitution of 1963.\\" The language of the proposal that appears on the ballot describes some aspects of these ten additional laws, acknowledging that giving effect to these ten laws is a major part of the proposal. House Joint Resolution UU of 2014 Public Act 467 of 2014 Public Act 468 of 2014 Public Act 469 of 2014 Public Act 470 of 2014 Public Act 471 of 2014 Public Act 472 of 2014 Public Act 473 of 2014 Public Act 474 of 2014 Public Act 475 of 2014 Public Act 476 of 2014 Ballot language Per Michigan law, Michigan Bureau of Elections Director Chris Thomas wrote the language for Proposal 1 as it appears on the ballot. The language was approved 3‚Äì1 by the Board of State Canvassers; the dissenting voter was Norman Shinkle, a Republican-appointed member of the Board, who noted, \\"This is a very complex proposal based on interplay of changing the constitution and the laws of Michigan\\". The proposal reads: Policies that would be enacted Sales tax increase The largest tax increase in the proposal is the raising of Michigan's state sales tax from 6% to 7%. An additional law passed in December 2014 and taking effect in October 2015 will require certain Internet retailers, such as Amazon.com, to collect Michigan's sales tax at the point of purchase. The constitutional amendment would allow for the sales tax increase, and a law put into effect by the proposal would immediately raise the sales tax to the newly authorized rate. Fuel tax modification and increase The proposal would exempt gasoline and diesel fuel used to operate a motor vehicle from the state sales tax; it would replace the exempted retail sales tax with an increase in the wholesale fuel tax. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy reports, \\"The state currently imposes both sales tax and a per-gallon excise tax on motor fuel. This excise tax along with vehicle license and registration fees are the primary source of revenue for the state's road maintenance budget. Under the measure, sales tax would no longer be imposed on fuel and the motor fuel tax would be replaced with a new wholesale tax levied at higher rates than currently. At a listed price of $2 per gallon, the state is currently collecting 29 cents per gallon in sales and excise taxes on gasoline. This proposal would increase those collections to 41.7 cents per gallon.\\" Additionally, the retail sales tax on gasoline is expressly eliminated only for vehicles \\"driving on Michigan roads.\\" It is not eliminated for off-road vehicles, including boats, agricultural machines, ATVs, snowmobiles, and other gasoline-powered vehicles and tools. Vehicle registration fee increase State Rep. Mike McCready, who sponsored the vehicle registration fee bill, said that legislative leaders knew that change would eliminate the federal deductions. McCready said that the legislature chose to eliminate the depreciation discounts for new vehicles, rather than increase the tax rate for all vehicles, because the legislature \\"felt this would be the least painful [option]\\". Funding for roads Michigan's proposed fiscal year 2015‚Äì16 budget contains cuts in discretionary funding for roads from $285 million the previous year and $451 million in 2014. The proposed amount for fiscal year 2015‚Äì16 is $113 million, according to the House Fiscal Agency. Governor Rick Snyder described the continuing cuts as intentional: \\"The point is, that's why this needs to get approved,\\" he said. Proposal 1 would increase spending on roads by approximately $400 million in the first year, $800 million in the second, and $1.2 billion in subsequent years. Under House Bill 5477, part of the proposal, for the 2015‚Äì16 fiscal year, $400 million of $1.2 billion raised from increasing fuel taxes would go to the Michigan Transportation Fund (MTF); the remaining money would be used to pay down a portion of the state's debt from previous road construction projects. For the 2016‚Äì17 fiscal year, $800 million of the $1.2 billion would go to the MTF, and starting in the 2017‚Äì18 fiscal year, nearly all of the projected $1.35 billion in fuel tax revenue would go to the MTF. \\"However, the language in the bill does not earmark a portion of the additional revenue resulting from the bill, but a portion of the total revenue generated by the Act. As a result, the language would result in a 56.6%, or $522.2 million, decline in MTF revenue available for roads.\\" Funding for schools and local governments Proposal 1 would have modified funding for schools and local governments. Changes in School Aid Fund usage rules Proposal 1 would have made changes to School Aid Fund usage rules. Earned Income Tax Credit expansion The Michigan Earned Income Tax Credit (MEITC) was amended in 2011, reducing the credit to eligible taxpayers from 20% of the federal Earned Income Credit to 6%. Proposal 1 would give effect to a law that increases that credit back to 20% of the federal amount. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated that if Proposal 1 passes, the average recipient of the MEITC who earns less than $20,000 will see a net tax break of $24. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy estimated that, if passed, Proposal 1 would result in typical Michigan families seeing an increase of $500 in taxes per year. Taxpayers who qualify for the MEITC would have, on average, a net tax break of $69; however, some MEITC recipients might see a tax increase. New competitive bidding rules Public Act 472, signed into law by the governor on January 10, 2015 and effective date still pending, concerns competitive bidding rules. Proposal 1 would have modified PA 472. Warranty expansion and affirmative action rules Public Act 473 of 2014, which takes effect if and only if Proposal 1 is adopted by voters, modifies rules for road contraction, including new affirmative action rules and warranty requirements. MichiganVotes.org summarized the bill as \\"to expand to local road agencies a requirement to warranties from contractors for road construction and preservation projects valued at more than $1 million. Under current law the warranty requirement only applies to the state Department of Transportation. Also, to require the Department of Transportation to give extra assistance (possibly including grants and loans) to \\"disadvantaged\\" businesses that bid on state funded road projects; and to take other steps to steer more state- funded road work to such firms, including annual consultations with certain ethnic- and race-based organizations.\\" Most policies subject to change Proposal 1 consists of a constitutional amendment that could not be modified without a subsequent vote of the people of Michigan, but ten laws that take effect if Proposal 1 passes, PA 467 through 476 of 2014, comprising most of the significant policy changes, are ordinary laws that are written so as to only take effect if the Proposal 1 is adopted. These laws, however, could be modified by the legislature at any time, before or after May 5, 2015, and before or after they are scheduled to take effect. Therefore, it is possible that the language describing these laws' effects on the May 5 ballot may be made false, before or after the election, by legislative action. Public polling A late-March statewide poll by Lansing-based EPIC-MRA found that 70 percent of voters were opposed to Proposal 1. Only 21 percent said they were in favor of the ballot issue. The remaining 9 percent were undecided. Arguments MLive Lansing published statements representing either side of the proposal on March 31, 2015: \\"Pro vs. Con on Proposal 1: Is it the best option or a political money grab?\\". Arguments in support There are three principal arguments advanced by \\"Safe Roads Yes!\\", the ballot committee supporting the proposal: Proposal 1 (1) guarantees that all taxes on gasoline are allocated to transportation; (2) guarantees that all money in the School Aid Fund goes toward K-12 education; and (3) extends pavement warranties so that road builders pay for repairs to poorly constructed roads. The proposal was to remove the sales tax from Michigan fuel sales. This was claimed to remedy the anomalous perverse situation where \\"Michigan charges some of the highest taxes on fuel in the nation, but still has among the lowest per-lane- mile spending on roads.\\" Nolan Finley, editor of The Detroit News, which has endorsed the proposal, wrote in support of the proposal, noting that \\"There is no Plan B\\". Finley argued that the option of cutting spending from other areas of the budget will not work, because\\"Republicans aren't going to make substantial cuts to prison spending, Democrats aren't going to hack welfare spending, and neither party is going to touch school spending.\\" Finley noted that, in his opinion, the best course of action would be to raise the money through an increased fuel tax; however, the legislature had been unable to pass such a bill last session and would likely be unable to do so now. Finley concluded by saying that if the proposal fails, revenue increases will be off the table, making Proposal 1 the only option. \\"So the real message to voters should be this: Hold your noses and vote for Prop 1, or keep driving on what may be the deadliest roads in America. Guaranteed.\\" MLive Media Group, in its editorial endorsement of Proposal 1, argued that has been under investing in infrastructure, schools, and municipalities for too long, and that the only way to rectify this is through a tax increase. The editorial argued that \\"[t]here is no viable alternative.\\" The editorial also contested claims by opposition groups, saying, \\"Schools and municipalities are not 'special interests,' as Proposal 1 opponents cynically call them.\\" Arguments in opposition Opponents of Proposal 1 argue that tax increases are unnecessary to fix the roads. They use as an example an alternative proposal passed by the Michigan House that would not raise taxes in December 2014, supported by then- speaker Jase Bolger. In an op-ed published by MLive, Rep. Tom McMillin made three arguments to show that tax increases were not necessary: (1) Noting that the state's budget increased close to $5 billion from 2012 to 2015 and that the tax increase only raises $2 billion annually, the new taxes would only offset new spending, which has not gone to roads; (2) in 2014, the state House passed a bill \\"to fully fix and fund roads without any tax increases, by simply prioritizing new spending\\", but the governor blocked the legislation; and (3) \\"[r]oads are an ordinary budget item in forty-nine states\\", and road funding should just be \\"budget discussions, not some political hostage brought before voters to demand higher taxes\\". An editorial in the Battle Creek Enquirer contested the assertion that there is no alternative to fixing roads but Proposal 1: \\"Proposal 1 proponents are calling the initiative our best‚Äîeven only‚Äîhope for addressing the state's crumbling infrastructure. The governor and others remind us that 'there's no Plan B.' That's a lot of bunk, and it's insulting to voters who shouldn't be in this position. We pay legislators to legislate, and we expect the governor to lead. No elected leaders should be hiding behind voters on this.\\" Concerned Taxpayers of Michigan, a group opposed to Proposal 1, argued that the political ramifications of Proposal 1 were an additional reason to vote no: \\"If Proposal 1 is passed, the public will have shown to the politicians that they accept their worst. That We the People will settle for anything: the worst they can do, we'll accept as the best.\\" Critics of Proposal 1 have also pointed out that just over half of the tax revenue raised by Proposal 1 would go toward road funding, with 40% going toward schools, revenue sharing with local governments, and other projects unrelated to roads. People and groups in support The campaign supporting Proposal 1 is being led by the Safe Roads Yes committee. The largest contributor to Safe Roads Yes as of the February 2015 disclosure was the Michigan Infrastructure Transportation Association . Groups in favor of Proposal 1 include AFL-CIO of Michigan, the Michigan Association of School Administrators, the Michigan Education Association, the Michigan Environmental Council, the Michigan Farm Bureau, the Michigan Municipal League, the Michigan Public Transit Association, and Michigan School Business Officials. People and groups in opposition Four ballot committees are filed in Michigan opposing Proposal 1: Concerned Taxpayers of Michigan, led by former State Rep. Tom McMillin; Coalition Against Higher Taxes and Special Interest Deals, led by former congressional candidate and businessman Paul Mitchell; Protect Michigan Taxpayers, led by Keith Allard; and Citizens Against Middle Class Tax Increases, led by political consultant John Yob. At least 33 county and congressional district Republican committees have passed resolutions expressing official opposition to Proposal 1. In a news release issued by district chairman Tom McMillin as his committee passed such a resolution, McMillin commented \\"In my 25 years of activism within the Republican party, I've never seen anything like this‚Äîso many District and County Republican party committees coming out against a significant proposal by a sitting Republican Governor.\\" Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette criticized the proposal, saying, \\"From a policy perspective, this proposal has a lot of potholes and pitfalls. It's a massive $1.9 billion sales tax increase that goes well beyond road funding. There's just too much under the tree.\\" Numerous other organizations have made official statements opposing Proposal 1, including several Tea Party groups,  * the Michigan Taxpayers Alliance, the National Federation of Independent Business, the Wayne County Taxpayers Association, Inc., Our America Initiative, the Libertarian Party of Michigan, the Green Party of Michigan, and the Socialist Party of Michigan. Alternatives A package of three bills supported by then-Speaker Jase Bolger were passed in December 2014 to fund roads by redirecting new spending to roads. Bolger published an op-ed in the Detroit Free Press defending the plan. The plan has been re-introduced by Rep. Gary Glenn and Todd Courser. Thirteen additional House representatives are co-sponsors of the legislation in 2015. Senator Patrick Colbeck has also proposed multiple solutions. Results The proposal was defeated in part by a grass roots campaign, which was out-funded by a factor of 20 to 1 by the proponents. It was an unprecedented defeat of a constitutional proposal in Michigan. Aftermath Governor Rick Snyder said he would immediately try to find a fix. He has promised to work with the legislature an effort to find a new solution to the state's road funding conundrum. But he had no estimated time of arrival for a result, noting that the legislature has other pressing issues, including the budget, on its agenda. Moving governmental expenditures is said to be \\"Plan B,\\" especially given that this legislature is even more anti-tax and conservative than the one that passed the defeated proposal.

In 1995, Canada made a complaint to the World Trade Organization, of which both countries are members, about Australia's restriction on imports of fresh salmon, which were part of a quarantine measure for health purposes. WTO dispute resolution favored Canada, both in a 1997 panel decision and in a subsequent decision by the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO determined that the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) did not allow Australia's import ban. The WTO ordered Australia to lift its ban and increased quarantine requirements not only for salmon, but for imports of other species of fish as well. The parties settled their dispute in 2000. Salmon industry and origins of the dispute In the 1990s, major world salmon exporters include Canada, Norway, Chile, Scotland, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand, and Australia.Michael Richardson, Ottawa Sees Protectionism by Canberra; Canada's Beef: Salmon, New York Times, 10 November 1995. In 1995, Australia had a 100 million AUD (75.1 million USD) salmon industry, with a total value of Australian salmon exports (mostly to east Asia, particularly Japan) of about 40 million dollars. In 1975, Australia imposed a ban on imports of fresh salmon under a quarantine regulation intended to prevent entry of imported diseases into fish stock in Australia. Australia did allow imports of non-fresh salmon, including salmon that had been heat-treated by canning (see salmon cannery) or smoking, which reduces the risk of disease. In 1995, the annual value of such imports to Australia was about 52 million dollars, with almost half of these imports coming from Canada. Australian salmon had an advantage in Japanese and other markets, selling for premiums up to 20 percent over other imported fresh salmon, because of Australian environmental regulations. In the 1990s, however, tensions arose between Canada and Australia over Australia's regulation, negatively affecting the two countries' relations. The Australians argued that the ban was justified on health grounds; the Canadians argued that there was no scientific evidence that Canadian fresh-salmon imports would be unsafe and that the ban was simply protectionism. Salmon for sale at a fish market. WTO case and settlement In the 1990s, Canada brought a dispute to the World Trade Organization (WTC) against Australia regarding the importation of salmon. The official title of the case was Australia ‚Äî Measures Affecting Importation of Salmon, Dispute DS18.Dispute Settlement: Dispute DS18: Australia ‚Äî Measures Affecting Importation of Salmon, World Trade Organization. The dispute was the first challenged under the 1994 Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) reached following the 1994 Uruguay Round. The case formally began with Canada's request for consultations on October 1995. Canada alleged that Australia's prohibition on Canadian salmon imports under the Australian quarantine regulation was inconsistent with the SPS Agreement and articles XI and XIII of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Following requests from Canada to establish a panel, the DSB did so in April 1997. The European Communities, India, Norway, and the United States reserved their third-party rights. The panel was composed in May 1997, and the panel report circulated in June 1998. The panel determined that Australia's important ban was \\"inconsistent with Articles 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.5, and 5.6 of the SPS Agreement, and also nullified or impaired benefits accruing to Canada under the SPS Agreement.\\" In June 1998, Australia filed a notice of its intention to appeal the panel's decision to the WTO Appellate Body. The Appellate Body report circulated in October 1998. The Appellate Body reversed the panel with respect to its reasoning on Articles 5.1 and 2.2 of the SPS Agreement, but found that Australia \\"had acted inconsistently\\" with those sections. The Appellate Body also broadened the panel's determination that Australia had acted inconsistently with Articles 5.5 and 2.3 of the SPS Agreement. Finally the Appellate Body \\"reversed the panel's finding that Australia had acted inconsistently with Article 5.6 of the SPS Agreement but was unable to come to a conclusion whether or not Australia's measure was consistent with Article 5.6 due to insufficient factual findings by the panel.\\" The decision directed Australia not only to lift the ban on Canadian salmon, but also the quarantine requirements for several other species of fish. The DSB adopted the Appellate Body report and the panel report, as modified by the Appellate Body report in November 1998. Australia expressed its intention to abide by the DSB's decision. In December 1998, Canada requested arbitration under to Article 21.3(c) of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) \\"to determine the reasonable period of time for implementation of the recommendations of the DSB.\\" The Article 21.3(c) Arbitration Report was circulated in February 1999; it determined that the reasonable period of time for implementation was eight months (i.e., the period ending on 6 July 1999). After Canada brought this dispute to the WTO, Australia published the \\"1999 Import Risk Analysis\\" arguing that the import of frozen, fresh or chilled salmon is a health risk. In 1999, Canada made requests under the DSU for a determination by the original panel of whether the implementation measures taken by Australia were consistent with WTO rules as determined in the dispute-resolution proceedings. At its meeting of 28 July 1999, the DSB agreed to take up Canada's request and referred the matter back to the original panel. The EC, Norway and the U.S. again reserved their third-party rights. The compliance panel was composed in September 1999 and circulated its report in February 2000, finding: The DSB adopted the report of the compliance panel in March 2000. In July 1999, before compliance proceedings began, Canada requested authorization from the DSB, pursuant to Article 22.2 of the DSU, to suspend concessions to Australia because of its non-compliance. Australia objected to Canada's proposed level of suspension of concessions and requested that the matter be referred to arbitration, pursuant to Article 22.6. The DSB agreed to this request, but the arbitration proceedings were suspended until after the compliance proceedings concluded. At the DSB meeting of 18 May 2000, following the compliance panel's decision, and following discussion between the WTO and the governments of the two countries, sectors of each government and the panel, Canada announced that it had come to an agreement with Australia to bring the dispute to a close. The parties exchanged letters detailing the agreement. Under the agreement, \\"Canada would monitor closely Australia's commitment to implement the agreement\\" by 1 June 2000. The agreement became effective on schedule on 1 June 2000. Countries   Canada  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) verifies that exported foods and food products meet the Canadian standards just as an importing country would. Countries have their own requirements for foods and food products and the Canadian government understands this and respects those requirements. Canada has implemented the fish inspection act to help regulate the export of fish and fish products. The efforts Canada has put towards achieving a substantial export in their fish (salmon) shows speculation towards Australia.  Australia  Aquaculture in Australia is the country's fastest growing primary industry accounting for 34% of the countries seafood production. Salmon is a part of this movement across the country with Atlantic salmon becoming a mainstream fish produced through the aquaculture systems. Salmon farms are found in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia and while they are making an effort to improve salmon farming offshore and inshore it is still producing a small amount of salmon for Australia. Although the countries were developing a negative trade relationship, Australia values its long-standing close and productive relationship with Canada. Their trade relationship dates back over 100 years and the two countries continuously work together. Australian and Canadian military forces fought side by side in both World Wars, The Korean War and the 1990-91 Gulf War. Both countries have forces in Afghanistan making movements to stabilize that country as close military allies.

Even for designs containing a good number of datapath elements, the controller occupies a sizeable portion. As the devices are mostly portable and hand-held, reducing power dissipation has emerged as the primary concern of today‚Äôs VLSI designers. While the datapath elements can be shut down when they are not being used, controllers are always active. As a result, the controller consumes a good amount of system power. Thus, power-efficient synthesis of FSM has come up as a very important problem domain, attracting a lot of research. The synthesis method must be able to reduce both dynamic power and leakage power consumed by the circuit.  FSM synthesis  An FSM can be defined as a quintuplet that consists of a set of primary inputs, a set of primary outputs, a set of states, a next-state function and an output function. The next-state function maps the present- state and the primary inputs to a next-state; the output function maps the primary inputs and present-state onto the primary outputs. Any deterministic sequential function can be represented by the use of this model. A FSM can be separated into two parts viz., combinational circuit and memory. The optimal synthesis of finite-state machines is an important step in digital design. The three basic steps involved in the FSM synthesis are: #State minimization:The number of states is reduced by recognizing the equivalent states that are present in the FSM and merging them. When state minimization is possible, it is deemed that the resulting FSM will be easier to build #State encoding: The complexity of the combinational logic depends on the assignment of codes to each of the states in the FSM. This is also referred to as state assignment. A good state assignment reduces the cost of implementation significantly. There are many encoding techniques such as Gray coding, Binary coding, One-Hot coding, etc. #Determination of Boolean functions for next-state and output functions: The Boolean equations can be obtained by a two-level structure or random-logic by an interconnection of logic primitives. In either case, Boolean minimization, logical partitioning and decomposition are essential for an efficient realization  Low-power synthesis  In CMOS circuits, power is dissipated in a gate when the gate output changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. Optimizing for low average power consumption in digital CMOS circuits is in most of the cases motivated by reducing the problems related to either heat generated by the integrated circuit (IC) or by limited power supply resources, as in portable battery-operated equipment. The most common approach for low power FSM synthesis is to divide the FSM into two or more sub-FSMs in which at any given instant only one of these is active. The power minimization problem can be considered at various levels viz., algorithmic, architectural, logic and circuit levels. The dynamic power consumed in synchronous CMOS circuits is given by: P = V_{DD}^2 f sum_i {alpha_i} {C_i}, where alpha_i is the probability of a signal transmission within a clock period at node i, C_i is the switched capacitance, V_{DD} is the supply voltage and f is the clock frequency.  Synthesis methods  # Partitioning of the FSM physically increases the area of the circuit but reduces the dynamic power consumed. # In the synthesis, state encoding plays an important role for efficient realization. The Boolean distance between the codes is minimized with a high transition probability, using a probability descriptor of the FSM. # In input disabling precomputational based approach, datapath units which are combinational logic are turned off to disable the values to the input signals. This reduces the dynamic power # In sequential circuits, gate-clock techniques such as Power gating are used to disable the clock signal to the parts of the system that are idle # For complex microprocessors, floating point units and cache memory blocks are turned off when idle. This method is called dynamic power management  Limitations  The amount of power that is saved by partitioning the FSM is mainly determined by how good the partitioning algorithm can cluster strongly connected states together in sub-FSMs and by how large the cost is, in terms of power, to make a state transition from one sub-FSM to another.

Music In the first three years of the program profiled itself as a pop, rock and urban station aimed at young people. Due to lack of success the station threw mid 2008 the helm and they start focusing on nederpop and \\"soft\\" music. Here many presenters were dismissed.

One of these plots was designated by the government for music of Dutch and European soil, the so-called plot A9.

The review committee found that this difference \\"not significant\\" was, after the financial bid of 23 million euros of RTL against the 8,000 euros of the Finnish Media Sales was decisive and RTL FM came on the air.

The Journal was launched on 25 October 2011 at the Lauterpacht Centre for International Law in Cambridge by its inaugural Editors-in-Chief and Professor James Crawford SC, who called it \\"a useful complement to Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law [published by Cambridge University Press\\", as both fall well within the Cambridge ethos of trying to look into international law from a broad perspective\\". The journal is run and edited by students at the University of Cambridge but receives assistance from an Academic Review Board . It is the second Journal of the Faculty of Law at the University (the other one being the Cambridge Law Journal ) and one of the very few open access double blind peer review journals on international and comparative law. The CJICL is entering its third year of operation in the 2013-14 academic year, with 56 members on its editorial board. The Journal publishes articles, case notes and book reviews on international law, comparative law, EU law and transnational law in four issues throughout the year (two regular issues, a compendium of conference papers from the CJICL conference and the UK Supreme Court Review ‚Äì the latter is compiled by the editorial staff of the Journal and analyses the work of the UKSC in the previous judicial year). It also runs an online blog, which publishes short articles on topical international and comparative law issues. The CJICL holds an annual conference on International law.  History  Since its establishment in 2011, the journal has published three issues in its first volume, and four issues in the second volume, which addressed a range of topics including international law and dispute settlement, EU Law, human rights and comparative law providing a platform for both young and well- established academics to engage in dialogue with each other through publications in the journal. The journal has a double-blind peer-review process with an academic review board of eminent scholars in the field of International and Comparative Law. In its first two volumes, the journal has published a number of articles by prominent academics, established practitioners and pre-eminent judges, including Sir Christopher Greenwood of the International Court of Justice.

Daughter of historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., she sought independence from her family's fame, practiced ‚Äúprotest art‚Äù, and came out as a transgender. She made strong rapport with the Chicano community in Venice, California, where she founded the cross-cultural art centre SPARC.  Life and career  Schlesinger is the daughter of the famous historian, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr and artist Marian Cannon Schlesinger. Schlesinger grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She had two brothers, one sister, and a half- brother. She was the middle child. Schlesinger's mother could paint and made portraits of her children. Schlesinger always considered herself a tomboy and recalls that she and her mother argued about her wearing dresses. Instead, she wanted to do things which were considered traditionally male at the time. Schlesinger attended Radcliffe College and was an English and Fine Arts major, graduating cum laude in 1968. She attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture during the summer of 1968. After Schlesinger finished school, she started to create \\"protest art.\\" Her mother and father were divorced in 1970. The divorce created a desire in Schlesinger to \\"get away\\" and she also wanted to prove that she was more than a famous name and she had her own things to say. In 1971, Schlesinger moved to Los Angeles. Schlesinger came out as a transgender in Venice, California and found the Chicano community to be supportive of her. Schlesinger met artist, Judy Baca, at a feminist workshop with Judy Chicago. The two artists collaborated on a mural in Venice. In 1976, she and Baca and filmmaker Donna Deitch, co-founded SPARC. Schlesinger was instrumental in coming up with the name of the center. Schlesinger remains proud of her part in SPARC and its commitment to public art that uncovers hidden parts of history and lends a political and social consciousness to art. She was also part of the team of artists who helped design The Great Wall of Los Angeles. Schlesinger moved back to New York in the 1980s, where she quickly started showing her work. In the early 1990s, Schlesinger became part of the Guerrilla Girls. Each artist in the Guerrilla Girls chooses to remain anonymous and go by an artist's name. Schlesinger chose the name Romaine Brooks. Schlesinger received an MFA from Rutgers in 1994. Schlesinger was an art teacher at the Ross School, where she worked from 1996 until 2005. During this time, she adopted a daughter, Chun, from China. In 2001, she moved to East Hampton and later built a studio there. In 2008, Schlesinger was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment and complications from the cancer kept her from painting for two years. Schlesinger was sometimes too depressed and tired to work on art. After her recovery, Schlesinger continues to work, teach and show her art in different venues.  Art  In the 1990s Schlesinger created \\"explicitly erotic work.\\" During the 1990s, it was very taboo for lesbians to bring up issues of security, and many felt as if they were \\"forced into hiding.\\" Schlesinger boldly depicted lesbians (including portraits of herself) wearing dildos and penetrating other women. Schlesinger was interested in \\"representing female masculinity\\" and \\"refuting the notion that the artist's erotic gaze is exclusively male.\\" Her work was also very much about embracing and celebrating her sexuality. These paintings and etchings of a very erotic nature were considered gutsy and groundbreaking, and many of them were not shown again until 2014. Marc Chagall Comes to Venice Beach (1991) is a large mural in painted on the Israel Levin Senior Adult Center in Venice, California. The mural celebrates Jewish and Easter European contributions to Los Angeles. In 1994, the building was destroyed in the Northridge earthquake. Later, the senior center was rebuilt, and Schlesinger went back to Los Angeles to redo the mural with several local Venice artists assisting her. The mural was redone in 1996. Schlesinger's landscapes are often seen as much more neutral in their representations. The Long Good-Bye is a \\"harmonious\\" painting, which depicts two trees in the moonlight. Over time, Schlesinger has moved from creating representational work to colorful abstractions. Some of her artistic influences include Henri de Toulouse- Lautrec, photographer Brassa√è, Miriam Schapiro, and Sigmar Polke.

He was born at Singapore and died at Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex. Rowell was educated at Marlborough College and Jesus College, Cambridge. He was captain of cricket at Marlborough and was tried in trial matches and a few first-class games for Cambridge University in each of his first three years at the university from 1888 to 1890, without achieving any real success. The 1891 season, Rowell's last at the university, went in much the same direction with a few unsuccessful games, after which he was dropped from the university team; but towards the end of June he was picked for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team to play against Cambridge University and scored 53 as an opening batsman, more than the whole Cambridge team mustered in their first innings. That led to his recall for the University Match against Oxford University at Lord's, which Cambridge won narrowly, though Rowell contributed scores of just 3 and 1. It was his last first-class match. Earlier in the same academic year, he had also been selected for a rugby union Blue as a forward in the match against Oxford; Sammy Woods was in both the rugby and cricket teams alongside him. Rowell graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1891. His later career is not certain, but the directory of Cambridge alumni states that he became a brewer.

History  Centre was founded by eastern moderates who had been politically homeless since the 1888 Liberal split, and it was often characterised as the Eastern Norway parallel to the Moderate Liberal Party (based in the south-west). While informally known as the \\"Moderate Party of Eastern Norway\\", it remained an independent party- organisation despite talks of a possible merger. Their common goal was to work against the Liberals' policy of challenging the union with Sweden, expanding voting rights, and taxes. Presenting itself as a rural agrarian party with its base among farmers, Centre largely adopted the protectionist program of the Norwegian Agrarian Association from 1895/96. The party was otherwise ideologically closely connected to the conservative Christian section of the folk high school movement. Along with Frits Hansen, an educator himself, another co-founder was the priest and fellow educator Christopher Bruun. In elections the party cooperated with the Conservative Party. After declining support, some members joined the Conservative Party around 1900, and when the Coalition Party was formed in 1903 Centre was absorbed into the alliance.

However, at that time, marshal of the branch was also the lowest marshal-rank of the Red Army, and later of the Soviet Army. In modern context, it might be comparable to the NATO OF9-rank.The abbreviation \\"OF\\" stands for German Offizier, English officer or French officier Marshal of the branch was nominal the equivalent rank level to army general (OF-9). However, general officers on that particular rank were not authorised, competent and mandated to be appointed to, or to act on the position of commander in chief of a big formation or command. Introduction and sequence of ranks  The term \\"marshal of the branch\\" was calqued from the German General der Waffengattung (general of the branch). The first general officers of the air force, artillery, and armored troops were promoted on 16 January 1943 under the rank designation:Disposal of the \\"Presidium of the Supreme Soviet\\" from January 16, 1943 ‚Ä¶ on introduction of the new of ranks marshal of the aviation, marshal of the artillery and marshal of the armored troops. *Marshal of Aviation (–º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –∞–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏) *Marshal of Artillery (–º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –∞—Ä—Ç–∏–ª–ª–µ—Ä–∏–∏) *Marshal of the Armored Troops (–º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª —Ç–∞–Ω–∫–æ–≤—ã—Ö –≤–æ–π—Å–∫) In October 1943, it was followed by the communications and engineer branches with the ranks: *Marshal of the Signal Troops (–º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –≤–æ–π—Å–∫ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏) *Marshal of the Engineer Troops (–º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä—ã—Ö –≤–æ–π—Å–∫) The top ranks of that rank group were chief marshal of the branch with the designation:Disposal of the \\"Presidium of the Supreme Soviet\\" from October 9, 1943 ‚Ä¶ on introduction of the ranks of marshal of the communications troops and marshal of the engineer troops, as well as the introduction of the rank of chief marshal of the branch. *Chief marshal of aviation (–≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –∞–≤–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏) *Chief marshal of artillery (–≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –∞—Ä—Ç–∏–ª–ª–µ—Ä–∏–∏) *Chief marshal of the armored troops (–≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª —Ç–∞–Ω–∫–æ–≤—ã—Ö –≤–æ–π—Å–∫) *Chief marshal of the signal troops (–≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –≤–æ–π—Å–∫ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏) *Chief marshal of the engineer troops (–≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Ä—à–∞–ª –∏–Ω–∂–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–æ–π—Å–∫) The five ranks marshal of the branch, as well as chief marshal of the branch were created at OF9-level. { class=\\"wikipedia sortable\\" border=\\"1\\" -align=\\"center\\" width=\\"30%\\" colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor= \\"#A0E0A0\\"Sequence of ranks -align=\\"center\\" width=\\"30%\\" colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" bgcolor= \\"#A0E0A0\\" Lower rank: Colonel general (–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª-–ø–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫) width=\\"30%\\" colspan=\\"2\\" bgcolor= \\"#A0E0A0\\"General of the army (–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª –∞—Ä–º–∏–∏) -align=\\"center\\" width=\\"35%\\" style=\\"background:#bfbfbf;\\"30px Marshal of the branch (–ú–∞ÃÅ—Ä—à–∞–ª —Ä–æÃÅ–¥–∞ –≤–æÃÅ–π—Å–∫) width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#afafaf;\\"  Higher rank: Chief marshal of the branch (–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –º–∞ÃÅ—Ä—à–∞–ª —Ä–æÃÅ–¥–∞ –≤–æÃÅ–π—Å–∫) } Rank insignia The rank insignia of marshal of the branch was a large (c.50mm wide) five-pointed shoulder board star (at the time the same star was used on the shoulder boards of marshals of the Soviet Union). A marshal of the branch wore the second level five-pointed marshal's star on his uniform necktie. When the rank of chief marshal of the branch was established, the size of the shoulder board stars for marshals was made about 10mm smaller, indicating the superiority of the marshal of the Soviet Union. The first level marshal's star was worn on the uniform tie of chief marshals of the branch and marshals of the Soviet Union. In the branches, the rank of colonel general was succeeded by the rank of marshal of the branch, while the rank of marshal of a branch was apparently equal to the rank of general of the army (who was only entitled to the four small shoulder board stars). Marshals of branch, chief marshals of the branch and general of the army were at the OF9-level, generals of the army had neither marshals' stars on shoulder boards or uniform ties. However, in 1974 generals of the army were given the 40mm star shoulder board and the marshal's star of the second level on the tie. Marshals of the branches were normally eligible for promotion to chief marshal of branch, however, neither was eligible for promotion to marshal of the Soviet Union. After 1984, the rank of marshal was preserved only in the air force and artillery. Later, the rank of marshal stopped being conferred even in these branches. The regulations of Russian Army, confirmed in 1993, unified the system of general ranks in all the branches. The ranks of marshal of the artillery and marshal of the aviation were replaced by the one of general of the army (or army aviation), and the rank of chief marshal was cancelled.

In 1998 he graduated with a Ph.D. from the Netherlands Institute of Ecology and since that time worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Groningen, Bangor universities as well as University of California, Santa Cruz. In 2004 he joined Animal Ecology Group, a division of Groningen and three years later became Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research's fellow. Career Christiaan Both studied density dependent reproduction during his PhD, where he aimed to understand why birds lay smaller clutches when competition increased. This work was both using long-term data from hole-breeding passerines, and also experimental. It showed that great tit clutch size is causally affected by local density, and that the density dependent response could be explained by an optimal response of individuals to the level of competition for food during the nestling phase. From 1998 Christiaan Both, Niels Dingemanse, Piet Drent and Joost Tinbergen have studied great tits' exploration and showed that this variation in personality traits is heritable. They were interested in how such variation with an heritable component could be maintained over evolutionary time, and therefore studied fitness consequences for three years in a wild population of great tits. Selection was fluctuating between years, between the sexes and pair-combinations of personality was found to be important Since 2001 Christiaan Both mostly worked on the effects of climate change on trophic interactions, with an emphasis on changes phenology. Together with Marcel Visser he showed that climate change resulted in an insufficient response in timing of migration and egg-laying in the long-distance migratory pied flycatcher, and that local populations declined as a result of increased asynchrony between breeding time and the date of the local food peak. He is mostly interested in how different organisms can respond with different mechanisms and speeds to the high rates of current climate change, and the consequences this has for trophic interactions.

The league had been formed in 2007 from the merger of the Devon County League and the South Western League, and is restricted to clubs based in Cornwall and Devon. The Premier Division of the South West Peninsula League is on the same level of the National League System as the Western League Division One. The constitution was announced on 15 May 2015. With regard to relegation from Division One East and Division One West, if only one club were eligible for promotion from these two divisions, then no club would be relegated, but if two clubs were eligible, then one club would be relegated and a playoff match would determine the relegated club. In the event, Okehampton Argyle accepted relegation without participating in a playoff. Premier Division The Premier Division featured 20 teams, the same as the previous season, after Bovey Tracey were relegated to Division One East, and Elmore resigned mid- season. Two new clubs joined the league: *Helston Athletic, promoted from Division One West. *Tavistock, promoted from Division One East. *No club applied for promotion to Step 5. League table Division One East Division One East featured 18 clubs, the same as the previous season, after Tavistock were promoted to the Premier Division, Plymstock United were transferred to Division One West and two new clubs joined: *Bovey Tracey, relegated from the Premier Division. *Tiverton Town Reserves, promoted from the Devon and Exeter League. *Only Tiverton Town Reserves applied for promotion to the Premier Division, and the club passed the ground grading requirements.

It was released on March 3, 2015 by Atlantic and Vice as the fourth and final single from his second album Mr. Wonderful (2015). It was co-written by both artists, along with Zane Lowe, who did a punch-up to the chorus, and Mark Ronson, who also produced the song. A breakup song, \\"Baby Blue\\" ends a three-part suite started by \\"City Boy Blues\\" and \\"A Light in the Addict\\" that is preluded by the album's interlude, \\"Thug Love Story 2017 The Musical\\". The song received positive reviews from critics, who generally praised Chance's verse. \\"Baby Blue\\" was Bronson's first solo appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, debuting at number 91 for one week. It also charted at numbers 21 and 30 on the Hot Rap Songs and Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs charts respectively. The song was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting sales of over 500,000 copies. An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Lil Chris, was released on Bronson's YouTube page as part of the 2015 YouTube Music Awards and pays homage to the 1988 comedy film Coming to America. Background and development Following the album's first single \\"Easy Rider\\" (2014) and the digital release of \\"Actin' Crazy\\" (2015), Action Bronson revealed the track list for Mr. Wonderful and showed which songs had collaborations to them. \\"Baby Blue\\" was produced by Mark Ronson, who had previously produced for singers like Daniel Merriweather and Bruno Mars. The song was written by Ronson, Arian Arslani, Chancellor Bennett and Zane Lowe. It acts as a closer to a three-part suite set by \\"City Boy Blues\\" and \\"A Light in the Addict\\" that was preluded by the album's interlude, \\"Thug Love Story 2017 The Musical\\". It's about an elderly man who laments about a former love leaving the streets. In an interview with Complex, Bronson explained that he wanted to put together a small musical with the three tracks he had within the album and found the ending to it as a kiss-off to a former flame and moving on from it. The beat to Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz's \\"Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)\\" (1997) was used as a reference by Ronson to come up with the song's opening. The chorus to the song: \\"Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you / Baby girl, I'm blue,\\" was co-written by then-BBC Radio 1 host Zane Lowe, with Bronson providing vocals to it. Chance the Rapper, credited as a featured artist on the recording, explained to Complex that his verse for the song was inspired by an amalgam of various women he had previously encountered, while lending levity to the outcome of it all. Critical reception Critics praised Chance the Rapper's verse in the song. \\"Baby Blue\\" garnered positive reviews from music critics. Pat Levy of Consequence of Sound praised Bronson's singing over the piano-heavy production but singled out Chance's verse as the highlight for his \\"laundry list of things he hopes will happen to the girl who romantically maligned him.\\" Dan Weiss of Spin called it the standout of the album's suite, due in particular to Chance's absurdly dark and humorous lyrics. Jay Balfour from HipHopDX called it \\"a catchy piano-driven track with Pop appeal\\" and found Chance's verse on the song to be \\"personal and delightfully petty.\\" Colin Fitzgerald of PopMatters put the track alongside \\"Easy Rider\\" as 'album highlights', saying that without them \\"the album's second half would seriously hinder the overall value of Mr. Wonderful.\\" Craig Jenkins of Billboard commended Bronson for having \\"the courage to sing serviceably on the chorus.\\" Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork criticized Bronson's whiny vocals and Ronson's production throughout the song but gave praise to Chance's quirk-filled verse, saying that \\"he pulls off in half a minute what Bronson couldn‚Äôt in fifteen: using an imagined story to reveal humanity through humor.\\" Music video On March 9, 2015, Bronson stated via his Twitter account that a music video for the song was being worked on. He released a one-minute long \\"teaser\\" for the video on his YouTube page on March 21. Two days later, it premiered on Bronson's YouTube page as part of the 2015 YouTube Music Awards. The Lil Chris-directed video is a tribute to the 1988 comedy film Coming to America, with Bronson playing every character Eddie Murphy portrayed throughout the film. American rapper Big Body Bes and bodybuilder Jill Rudison both appear as Arsenio Hall and Shari Headley's characters respectively. Live performances On March 22, 2015, Bronson and Chance performed the song during SXSW at the 2015 mtvU Woodie Awards. On March 25, two days after the release of his second album, Bronson sang the song with Chance on national television for the first time on the Late Show with David Letterman with Chance's band The Social Experiment. On April 21, Bronson made an appearance on DJ Skee's SKEE TV via Fuse. Charts and certifications On the week of April 11, 2015, \\"Baby Blue\\" debuted at number 91 on the Billboard Hot 100, but left the next week. That same week, it debuted at number 30 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart, but fell eight spots to numbers 38 and 46 respectively for two consecutive weeks from April 18 to 25, before leaving the chart completely.

The Yuma developed a pictographic system that were probably older than the Egyptian hieroglyphics. The early Yuma people probably worshiped in caves, and many pictographs show scenes from nature, trading and mythology. In the beginning of the Creation myth of the Yuma, there was nothing but water. Then Kokomaht came up out of the water. Bakohtal was born out of the water too, but he was forever blind because of a lie Kokomaht told him. Kokomaht said, \\"I opened my eyes when I was underwater.\\" but this was a lie. Once the twins were born Bakohtal tried to create humans but they were not right. Instead of feet and hands they had lumps, but Bakohtal, being blind, thought it was perfect. However Kokomaht made a truly perfect being out of mud. He waved it four times toward the north and it stood on its feet. Then Kokomaht created the earth on top of the frog, Hanyi. Once he was finished and had made Komastam'h√≥, his son, he knew that his work was done, so he laid down on the earth and Hanyi sucked the breath out of him. Komashtam'h√≥ made a sun and moon and smothered it with his spit, and told the people, \\"Look this is the sun, it will give you warmth and peace.\\" Before Komashtam'h√≥ made a great flood, animals were people. Then Komashtam'h√≥ ordered everybody to shave their hair. The Great Flood Komashtam'h√≥ was displeased with the fact that the animal people did not look good with their hair cut, so he changed them into animals. However the newly formed animals were violent and dangerous so he sent a great flood. After a long time, Markohuvek, a person, asked Komashtam'h√≥ why he was making a great flood. Komashtam'h√≥ replied to Markohuvek that he was trying to protect the people from the newly formed animals. Markohuvek replied that gradually people would freeze to death since there wasn't any fire. So Komastam'h√≥ made a great fire to evaporate the water. However he made it accidentally too hot and he was slightly burned. Komashtam'h√≥ then took a giant pole and smashed the house of his father. Water welling from the house became the Colorado River. And in it swam fish, eels, and other water animals. These were the beings created by Bakotahl. As for Bakotahl, he lays under the earth, and when there is an earthquake, the Yuma say, \\"It is the Blind Evil One stirring down below.\\" Tales Of Native America References Creation myths Quechan ","title":"Yuma creation myth"},{"id":"46492744","text":"Indian Creek is a stream in Bourbon and Linn counties, in the U.S. state of Kansas.

She co-authored, with husband Chris Conrad and Virginia Resner, Shattered Lives: Portraits From America's Drug War and Human Rights and the US Drug War. Norris was also the co-founder, managing editor, and publisher of the West Coast Leaf, the \\"cannabis newspaper of record\\" for the West Coast of the United States from 2008 to 2013. The newspaper has gone digital, and is now The Leaf Online. Education Norris earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied Sociology. She then pursued graduate studies at California State University, Los Angeles, where she earned a Master's degree in Education. Activism Norris began her Drug War activism in 1989, when she and her husband, Chris Conrad, founded the American Hemp Council. They became outspoken activists and organizers for the many uses of the hemp plant. In 1993, Norris assisted her husband in curating and designing the Amsterdam Hash, Marihuana & Hemp Museum. In 1995, Norris and her husband Chris Conrad partnered with Virginia Resner to create the \\"Human Rights '95: Atrocities of the Drug War\\" photo exhibit which put a human face on non-violent prisoners of the Drug War and showed how the Drug War operates through their personal stories. Launched at the Fort Mason Center in San Francisco on June 24, 1995 to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations, the exhibit looked at the issue in the context UN's Declaration on Human Rights. The grand opening presented a program called, \\"Give Drug Peace a Chance,\\" and included Ram Dass, Paul Krassner, Jello Biafra, Ngaio Bealum, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Terence Hallinan, and Dennis Peron. In November, 1995, Norris and Conrad created a photo exhibit for the Drugs Peace House in Amsterdam, Netherlands, that traveled to other European Cities. Norris created 30 smaller excerpted displays that were shown at libraries, universities, conferences, and events across the US under the name \\"Human Rights and the Drug War.\\" In order to reach a wider audience with this information, she developed the web site, Human Rights and the Drug War. In 1996, for the final six weeks of the signature-gathering period, Norris and Conrad were hired on as Community Action Coordinators, managing the volunteer signature gathering campaign effort for the Compassionate Use Act, later known as Proposition 215. In 2002, Norris founded the Cannabis Consumers Campaign, which operates a website where cannabis consumers can \\"come out\\" about their experiences using the plant and take a stand for equal rights. In 2006, Norris was a hired consultant on the California Cities Campaign which ran ballot initiatives in three cities to make enforcement of marijuana possession crimes the lowest law enforcement priority. The campaigns were successful in Santa Barbara (66% approval), Santa Monica (65%) and Santa Cruz (64%). In addition, she consulted with city officials in West Hollywood and San Francisco, which passed similar ordinances that same year. In 2008, Norris was a delegate to the Beyond 2008 NGO Forum in Vancouver, British Columbia, where multiple NGOs met to advise the United Nations on drug policy. The following year, Norris and husband Chris Conrad attended high-level meetings at the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna, when that body adopted \\"respect for human rights\\" as one of its policy recommendations. Awards In 2014, Norris and husband Chris Conrad were awarded the National Cannabis Activist Award at Seattle Hempfest. In 2010, Norris and Conrad shared the Lifetime Achievement Award from Oaksterdam University. In 2006, Norris was awarded the Pauline Sabin Award at the national NORML conference. In 2004, Norris shared the Outstanding Citizen Activism Award with Conrad at the national NORML conference. In 2001, Norris and Conrad shared the Robert C.

Goals of modification include introducing pest resistance, tweaking the amounts of certain chemicals produced by the plant, and to prevent browning or bruising of the tubers. Varieties modified to produce large amounts of starches may be approved for industrial use only, not for food. Currently marketed varieties Used for food =Innate= The genetically modified Innate potato was approved by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2014 and the US FDA in 2015. The cultivar was developed by J. R. Simplot Company. It is designed to resist blackspot bruising, browning and to contain less of the amino acid asparagine that turns into acrylamide during the frying of potatoes. Acrylamide is a probable human carcinogen, so reduced levels of it in fried potato foods is desirable. The 'Innate' name comes from the fact that this variety does not contain any genetic material from other species (the genes used are \\"innate\\" to potatoes) and uses RNA interference to switch off genes. Simplot hopes that not including genes from other species will assuage consumer fears about biotechnology. The \\"Innate\\" potato is not a single cultivar; rather, it is a group of potato varieties that have had the same genetic alterations applied using the same process. Five different potato varieties have been transformed, creating \\"innate\\" versions of the varieties, with all of the original traits, plus the engineered ones. Ranger Russet, Russet Burbank, and Atlantic potatoes have all been transformed by Simplot, as well as two proprietary varieties. Modifications of each variety involved two transformations, one for each of the two new traits. Thus there was a total of ten transformation events in developing the different Innate varieties. McDonald's is a major consumer of potatoes in the US. The Food and Water Watch has petitioned the company to reject the newly marketed Innate potatoes. McDonald's has announced that they have ruled out using Innate. Previously marketed varieties Used for food NewLeaf In 1995, Monsanto introduced the NewLeaf variety of potato which was their first genetically modified crop. It was designed to resist attack from the Colorado potato beetle due to the insertion of Bt toxin producing genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. The insect- resistant potatoes found only a small market, and Monsanto discontinued the sale of seed in 2001. Used in industry =Amflora= 'Amflora' (also known as EH92-527-1) was a cultivar developed by BASF Plant Science for production of pure amylopectin starch for processing into waxy potato starch. It was approved for industrial applications in the European Union market on 2 March 2010 by the European Commission, but was withdrawn from the EU market in January 2012 due to a lack of acceptance from farmers and consumers.James Kanter for the New York Times. January 16, 2012. BASF to Stop Selling Genetically Modified Products in Europe Unmarketed varieties A modified D√©sir√©e potato was developed in the 1990s by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had gone through two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station.Arpad Pusztai GM Food Safety: Scientific and Institutional Issues Science as Culture, Volume 11 Number 1 March 2002 The potatoes were modified to express the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant, which caused them to produce GNA lectin protein that is toxic to some insects. This variety of potatoes is the one which was involved in the Pusztai affair. In 2014, a team of British scientists published a paper about three- year field trial showing that another genetically modified version of the D√©sir√©e cultivar can resist infection after exposure to late blight, one of the most serious diseases of potatoes. They developed this potato for blight resistance by inserting a gene (Rpi-vnt1.1), into the DNA of D√©sir√©e potatoes. This gene, which conferred the resistance to blight, was isolated from a wild relative of potatoes, Solanum venturii, which is a native of South America. In 2017 scientists in Bangladesh developed their own variety of blight resistant GM potato.

Story Once there were five brothers and a sister. The brothers went deep into the forest to hunt but one by one they did not come back. The sister wanted to commit suicide, but did not know how to. So she picked up a pebble and swallowed it. Four days passed, and the sister felt pain. She thought death was coming, but she didn't mind. Instead of dying, she gave birth to a boy as strong as a rock. She named him Iya Hokshi, or Stone Boy. He grew ten times as fast as most babies did, and by a week he had made a bow and arrows all by himself. He was grown up fast and went out to hunt. But before he left, his mother wept. Iya Hokshi comforted her and told her that he was going to avenge his five uncles. Iya Hokshi went deep into the forest until he saw a hut. He was exhausted and went in to sleep. He saw five bundles propped against the wall and an old woman sitting by the fire. She showed great hospitality and fixed some meat for him. She then explained that she had a terrible back-ache and asked if he could jump on it gently. Iya Hokshi saw a dagger in her shirt and suspected that she killed his brothers.

The ‚ÄúNot Me, I‚Äôm Drug Free‚Äù campaign is designed to educate Cuyahoga Falls area elementary school students about the dangers of using meth and heroin by connecting with them using Facebook, yard signs, posters, T-shirts, incentive cards and much more. The initiative was launched on May 28, 2014, at an event held at DeWitt Elementary School, where Mayor Walters, Western Reserve Hospital President and CEO Dr. Kent, Police Chief Jack Davis, Fire Chief Paul Moledor, Cuyahoga Falls City Schools Superintendent Dr. Todd Nichols and Woodridge Schools Superintendent Walter Davis all spoke to the students, parents and community. Students and families who abstain from drugs can take advantage of the ‚ÄòFree‚Äô-wards incentive card, which offers valuable perks on food and family activities in and around Cuyahoga Falls. Envelope of Life In 2015, Western Reserve Hospital partnered with the City of Cuyahoga Falls to launch the Envelope of Life, a packet of forms and documents that puts vital information, medications and medical history immediately into the hands of first responders during an emergency. They can then make educated decisions about how to care for someone without relying on the person, who may be incapacitated or confused in the wake of their emergency. The Envelope of Life comes with a magnetic pouch, which fits conveniently on the refrigerator at home, and a glove-compartment envelope for vehicle emergencies. The program will be expanding to new communities in the summer of 2016. History Founded in 1943 as Cuyahoga Falls General Hospital, the hospital became a member of Summa Health Systems in 2001. It is a charter member of the Centers of Osteopathic Research and Education, and is fully accredited by the Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program. In 2009, Cuyahoga Falls General Hospital became Western Reserve Hospital as the result of a joint venture between Summa, who became a minority partner, and Western Reserve Hospital Partners, a group of about 200 physicians who assumed majority ownership and control of the hospital. In 2015, Summa Health Systems, which owns a 40% stake in the hospital, sued to keep its partnership with the hospital, after the doctors who owned a majority stake in the hospital allegedly removed members of Summa from the hospital board. The partnership entered into dispute when it was alleged by the doctors that Summa was violating terms of the agreement when they entered into a deal in 2013 with HealthSpan Partners. According to Western Reserve Hospital Partners, by giving minority ownership to HealthSpan, Western Reserve was limited to where it could offer its services.

Biography  Friskin studied in Glasgow with local organist Alfred Heap, and from 1900 (aged only 14) at the Royal College of Music under Edward Dannreuther for piano and (from 1905) Charles Villiers Stanford for composition. He completed his Piano Quintet in 1907 at the age of 21 and it was published by Stainer & Bell. Thomas Dunhill assessed it as \\"one of the most brilliant op.1's in existence\\".Foreman, Lewis: From Parry to Britten: British Music in Letters, 1900-1945 (1987), p. 36 After completing his studies, from 1909 to 1914 he taught at the Royal Normal College for the Blind. In 1914, he emigrated to the United States, where, at the invitation of Frank Damrosch he became a founding teacher the Institute of Musical Arts, forerunner of the Juilliard School of Music. He continued teaching at Juilliard until his death. While still at the Royal College, Friskin first met the composer and violist Rebecca Clarke (18861979). Friskin and Clarke, along with George Butterworth, formed a small choir to explore the works of Palestrina, asking Vaughan Williams to direct them. His 1912 Elegy for viola and piano might have been written with Clarke in mind. Over thirty years later they were married in New York City (on 23 September 1944), both aged 58, following a chance reunion. In 1925, he was the first pianist to perform J. S. Bach's Goldberg Variations in the United States, and in 1934, he performed both books of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier in two New York recitals. He eventually recorded the Goldberg Variations in 1956, a year after Glenn Gould's celebrated recording. His obituarist in The New York Times wrote, \\"he became known as a Bach specialist long before others began specializing in baroque composers\\", and \\"he doesn't exaggerate or distort the music and plays Bach in a way that goes to the heart of the music. Friskin was not pedantic in his approach to Bach. Nor was he overly Romantic, an accusation that has been levelled at some of his more famous contemporaries.\\" His early promise as a composer was stifled by his activities as a teacher and performerDoyle, John G. Friskin, James, in Grove Music Online (2001) and he appears to have given up composing soon after his move to the United States. The early Piano Quintet was followed by a series of Phantasie chamber works written for the Cobbett chamber music competitions, including a piano trio,English Piano Trios: Bridge, Friskin, Ireland, Moeran. BMS 418CD (2007) a string quartet and another piano quintet. The Piano Sonata, perhaps his last major work, dates from 1915. The composer returned to London to perform it at the Wigmore Hall in November, 1920.The Times, 13 November 1920, p 8 There were also a handful of orchestral works, including a Piano Concerto which remained in manuscript and which has apparently been lost.  Compositions  These include: * Ballade in C major for piano * Cello Sonata in F major * Concert Overture * Elegy for viola (or clarinet) and piano (1912) * Impromptu for cello and piano * Nocturne in E flat for piano * Phantasy for string quartet, winner of a Cobbett Prize in 1906 * Phantasy for piano trio in E minor * Phantasy Quintet (for piano, 2 violins, viola and cello) (1910 or 1912) * Piano Concerto * Piano Quartet in G minor * Piano Quintet in C minor, op 1 (1907) * Romance for cello and piano * Romance for violin and piano * Scherzo for cello and piano * Sonata for piano in A minor * Suite in D minor * Three Pieces for piano * Three Sacred Motets for unaccompanied five-part chorus * Violin Sonata in G major  Publications   References  External links * Wellington, Christopher (2011).

In October 2016 it was announced that Rocket Internet replaces Chorus Clean Energy AG in SDAX. Rocket Internet SE joined the MDAX index of German mid-cap stocks on March 19, 2018. This decision was announced by Deutsche B√∂rse AG (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) on March 5, 2018. On March 18, 2015 the company changed its legal form into an SE (Societas Europaea).

In 2011, 20 of the then-130 employees left Rocket Internet at the same time. According to media coverage at the time, the reason for this string of layoffs was \\"bad quality of new products\\" and a \\"gruff manner\\" towards employees in the course of Rocket Internet's expansion into a \\"large corporation\\". The former Rocket Internet managers subsequently went on to found the incubator Project A Ventures with help from the Otto Group. Questions have also been raised around Rocket's support of multiple competing companies in a particular business sector.

According to the recorded filiation of his son, Marcus' father's praenomen was Caeso Fabius. Livy states that during Marcus Fabius' first consulship in 483 BC there were attempts, continued from previous years, by the tribunes to increase their powers, which were successfully resisted by the Roman senate.Livy, 2.42 In his second consulship, his colleague was Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus. That year, Rome was rent by internal dissension, which encouraged the Veientes to take the field in the hope of breaking Roman power. They were supported by troops from other Etruscan cities. The consuls, mindful of the undisciplined conduct of the soldiers in the recent past, held their men back from fighting until repeated provocations by the Etruscan cavalry made the start of combat inevitable.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, ii. 45, 46. Fabius compelled those of the soldiers who were most eager to engage the enemy to swear to return victorious, before he would give the order for battle. A centurion, Marcus Flavoleius, was the first to swear the oath, upon the anger of Jove and Mars Gradivus, and thereafter the oath was repeated by the entire army. Once the fight had begun, the Roman commanders fought with great vigor, particularly after Quintus Fabius, the brother of the consul, was slain. Marcus Fabius and his brother Kaeso leapt over their brother's slain body, and exhorted the Romans to continue the fight. Manlius, leading the army's opposite wing, was dangerously wounded and forced to retire from the line. As his men began to fall back in disarray, Manlius' colleague Fabius arrived to prevent their slaughter and assure them that their leader was not dead. Manlius was able to appear himself and reassure the soldiers.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, ii. 46, 47. The Etruscans took advantage of a lull in the fighting to attack the Roman camp, breaching the defenses of the reserves. However, word of the attack reached the consuls, and Manlius stationed his men around the exits to the camp, surrounding the Etruscans. Desperate to make their escape, the invaders assaulted the consul's position, and after a volley of missiles was repulsed, a final charge overwhelmed Manlius, who fell mortally wounded. The Roman troops again began to panic, but one of the fallen consul's officers moved his body and cleared a way for the Etruscans to escape, allowing Fabius to crush them as they fled.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, ii. 47. Although the battle was a great victory for Fabius, the loss of his brother and his colleague was a severe blow, and he declined the honor of a triumph that had been offered by the Senate.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Romaike Archaiologia, ix. 5, 6, 11, 12.Paulus Orosius, Historiarum Adversum Paganos Libri VII ii. 5. Fabius gave the eulogy at the funerals of his brother and of Manlius. Thereafter, he earned the affection of the people by distributing the wounded troops among the households of the patricians to be cared for as they healed.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, ii. 47. According to Roman historical tradition, all of the male members of the gens Fabia except one perished in the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC. If this tradition is correct, then Marcus died that year in the disaster. Tradition identifies the sole survivor as his son Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, who was too young to go to war.Livy, 2.50; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 9.20-1 See also *Fabia (gens)  References  5th-century BC Romans Roman Republican consuls Vibulanus, Marcus 477 BC deaths Year of birth unknown ","title":"Marcus Fabius Vibulanus (consul 483 BC)"},{"id":"46493087","text":"Lath Branch is a stream in Bourbon County, Kansas, in the United States.

The organization created a certification board to administer specialty nursing certification programs for emergency nurses. The organization Established in 1970 as the Emergency Department Nurses Association, the organization resulted from the merger of two organizations. One of the organizations, also known as the Emergency Department Nurses Association, had been founded by Judith Kelleher on the West Coast; the other, the Emergency Room Nurses Organization, was established by Anita Dorr in the Eastern United States. ENA took its current name in 1985, emphasizing the role of emergency nurses over the practice setting of the emergency department. As of 2015, ENA has over 40,000 members in 35 nations. ENA has collected survey data on emergency nursing, including a member survey which indicated high job satisfaction in the specialty but pointed to concern among emergency nurses about workplace violence and safety. ENA has partnered with the Institute of Medicine to address issues related to emergency care reform. The organization also publishes public safety and injury prevention information, including its National Scorecard on State Roadway Laws, which looks at each state's use of items such as child safety seats, seatbelts, ignition lock devices and graduated driver licensing. The association has published emergency guidelines, including Guidelines for Care of Children in the Emergency Department, which was written in conjunction with the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics. ENA publishes a bimonthly, peer-reviewed journal, Journal of Emergency Nursing.

It is based on a polka by Johann Strauss II, Perpetuum mobile, Op. 257. Charivari was completed in 1981.  Composition  Charivari was initially thought as an orchestral showpiece based on the main motifs of the polka Perpetuum mobile by Johann Strauss II. Because of this strong association, even though it is not included in the score, the Strauss polka is always played attacca before Charivari, as the composition's first bars are very similar to the Perpetuum mobile ending. For this reason, the composition is also sometimes known as Perpetuum mobile/Charivari. The composition has been subtitled \\"An Austrian Journal for Orchestra\\" () by Gruber himself. According to the composer: The composition is dedicated to Barrie Gavin and was finished in Vienna on 7 December 1981. It was premiered by the London Sinfonietta conducted by Simon Rattle at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, in London, on 23 August 1983. However, Gruber decided to make a revised version of the composition later that year. The revised version was premiered by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Ivan Fischer in Vienna, on 22 January 1984. The initial version was published by Boosey and Hawkes in 1981, and the revised version followed in 1984.  Structure  A Charivari, a silver chain with coins and hunters' trophies, worn in Bavaria and Austria with traditional costumes The title of the composition plays with two meanings of the word \\"charivari\\": a garland-like traditional folk costume ornament used primarily in the Bavaria region called a charivari, and to noisy rough \\"cat\\" music (Katzenmusik). The composition is in one movement and takes 10 to 11 minutes to perform (12 minutes according to the publisher), even though it is generally played together with Strauss II's Perpetuum mobile, making it 14 minutes long. It is scored for a large orchestra, consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B-flat, two bassoons, two horns in F, two trumpets in C, two trombones, one tuba, timpani, a percussion section played by two to three percussionists, harp, and a large string section. Various musical styles are played throughout the compositions, ranging from a typical fast polka, as referencing the composition which it is based on, to a waltz. Gruber begins with a lush Viennese orchestration recalling the late- Romantic musical idiom of Strauss and Gustav Mahler, but builds up to a crisis:  Recordings  * The Tonk√ºnstler Orchestra performed the piece with Kristjan J√§rvi for BIS Records. The recording was released in September 2006. * The BBC Philharmonic, conducted by Gruber, recorded the piece for Chandos Records. The recording took place in the Studio 7 of the BBC Broadcasting House in Manchester and was released in 2007.

It is notable for formerly housing the REIMAHG-A aircraft factory, an underground facility for the production and assembly of the Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter jet during World War II. History Early history The Walpersberg was referred to until the 15th century as Walpurgis Mountain. There is some evidence of ancient settlements in the surrounding Saale Valley, dating from the Middle Palaeolithic period. Since the Middle Ages, three quarries on the Walpersberg have provided sandstone for local communities, often used as foundation material for houses. Evidence of these quarries can still be seen today. On the southern slope of the Walpersberg, buildings and artificial terraces were built for growing grapes for the purposes of wine production, although production declined in the 17th century. A trade route ran over the mountain, known as \\"Green Street\\". From the 18th century the route became known as the \\"Gothic Street\\", due to the fact that it was a connection road to the Castle Friedensstein in Gotha. By the late 19th century there was a thriving porcelain industry in nearby Kahla, and sand containing kaolin (a constituent material of porcelain) was found at the Walpersberg. Excavation began in 1897 by Kahlaer Porzellanwerke AG, creating a tunnel system extending 20 km. Use during World War II In 1944, a construction project was commenced by Nazi Germany to convert the former sand mines at the Walpersberg to a bomb-proof underground factory for the production of the Messerschmitt Me 262. To achieve this, the existing tunnel system was extended to 30 km by the use of over 12,000 forced labourers from Italy and Eastern Europe, and a further 3,000 skilled workers. Conversion of the former sand mines into the aircraft factory led to construction of a runway at the top of the Walpersberg. An inclined railway built into the side of the hill was used to move the aircraft from the ground level tunnel exit up to the runway, and the first Me 262 took off on 21 February 1945. Eventually only around 20 or 30 completed aircraft left the facility before it was liberated by US troops on 12-13 April 1945. Post-war use Following destruction of much of the structure by the Soviets, the remaining galleries under the Walpersberg were used as storage space for a fruit and vegetable warehouse during the 1950s. Later, from the 1960s, a part of the Walpersberg mine system was used by VEB Geological Research West for the storage of core samples. From 1974 until 1989, the Walpersberg was part of East Germany's Department of Defence storage complex KL-22, with ammunition, weapons, and other military supplies being stored there. The Bundeswehr later used the property until 1997, at which point high operating costs necessitated closure of the facility. Every year, around the 8th May, ceremonies take place in the communities surrounding the Walpersberg to commemorate the 2,000 forced labourers who died at the Walpersberg. It is a tradition that former forced labourers of REIMAHG from abroad attend these ceremonies. In the Kahla town museum, an exhibition dedicated to the \\"REIMAHG\\" factory, the camps, forced labor and the liberation by the US Army can be visited (www.kahla.de).

Heitmeier (born August 2, 1950) is a lobbyist and former manager of a telephone company from his native New Orleans, Louisiana, who is a Democratic former member of the Louisiana State Senate for District 7 in Orleans, Jefferson, and Plaquemines parishes. First elected in 1991, he was term-limited and ineligible to seek a fifth term in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 20, 2007. Background Heitmeier was reared in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans and graduated from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana. He has worked as an assistant manager of a telephone company and as a lobbyist in Baton Rouge. Heitmeier is a member of the executive board of the Greater New Orleans Tourist and Convention Committee. He has served on the headmaster's council for Roman Catholic Holy Cross School in New Orleans and is a board member of the religious institute, the Little Sisters of the Poor. He is married to the former Rai Lynn Umbach (born December 1950). Political life From 1984 to 1992, Heitmeier was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for Orleans Parish District 102. From 1978 to 1984, he was a member of the Orleans Parish Democratic Executive Committee. Heitmeier was handily elected in the 1991 primary for the District 7 state Senate seat vacated by the Republican Fritz Windhorst. Heitmeier polled 14,966 votes (54.8 percent) over five opponents, the strongest of whom was Republican Edward D. \\"Ed\\" Markle (born January 1950) of New Orleans, with 4,536 votes (16.6 percent). Heitmeier was handily reelected to a second term in the 1995 primary. With 14,551 votes (57.7 percent), he defeated two opponents, the strongest of whom was Republican Lynn Cheramie of New Orleans, who received 6,371 votes (25.3 percent). Heitmeier was unopposed for Senate District 7 in the 1999 and 2003 primaries. In 2006, Heitmeier ran second with 179,100 votes (27.8 percent) of the vote in a special election for Louisiana Secretary of State to fill the position left vacant in 2005 by the death of W. Fox McKeithen, a convert to the Louisiana Republican Party. The interim secretary of state, Al Ater, did not contest the position. The top vote-getter, State Senator Jay Dardenne of Baton Rouge, another Republican, polled 191,543 votes (29.8 percent) and was forced into a runoff election with Heitmeier. In third place was Republican former state party chairman Mike Francis, an energy industrialist from Crowley, who polled 168,118 (26.1 percent). None of the other four candidates, two of whom were Republicans, garnered more than 9 percent of the vote. Francis, a staunch conservative refused to support the more moderate Republican, Dardenne, in the pending runoff. However, Heitmeier withdrew from the race on the grounds that he lacked needed funding from national party sources. He also noted the decimation of the African-American voter base caused by Hurricane Katrina the previous year. Dardenne hence won by default. Dardenne was secretary of state until 2010, when he won another special election for a vacancy as lieutenant governor created by the resignation of Mitch Landrieu, who became mayor of New Orleans. In 2015, Lieutenant Governor Dardenne is a candidate for governor of Louisiana. Senator Heitmeier was rated from 38 to 100 percent by the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, 50 percent by the National Federation of Independent Business, 33 percent by Planned Parenthood. He had ratings from 8 to 60 percent by the American Civil Liberties Union. The Louisiana Family Forum ranked him 33, 60, and 80 percent in 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. The Louisiana Hospital Association scored him 100 percent in 2005. The Louisiana Association of Educators rated him 80 percent in 2001. The AFL-CIO rated him 79 percent in 1998. In 2014, Republican Governor Bobby Jindal signed a bill sponsored by Democratic State Representative Jeff Arnold to permit Heitmeier to lobby the legislature even though Heitmeier's brother, David Heitmeier, is the sitting senator for District 7, which includes the Algiers neighborhood. The special exemption permits an immediate family member of an elected official who was a lobbyist for the executive branch of state government for one year prior to January 9, 2012, to be able to lobby the legislature. David Heitmeier abstained from voting on the bill.

History Bad Martha Beer first appeared in stores, bars and restaurants on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard in June 2013 with two ales Vineyard Summer Ale and Martha‚Äôs Vineyard Ale. All Bad Martha Farmer‚Äôs Brewery craft beers are uniquely brewed with hand-picked wild grape leaves grown on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard. (26) Bad Martha Farmer‚Äôs Brewery creates about 50 different craft beers each year using local ingredients from surrounding farms and makers including fruits, berries, beach plums, honey, oysters, chocolate, coffee. In 2014, Bad Martha opened the first Bad Martha Farmer‚Äôs Brewery, a tasting barn modeled after the wine tasting rooms in Napa Valley. The flagship brewery tasting room is located in Edgartown on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard and features a changing selection of up to 10 beer varieties on tap brewed on site with a 7-barrel brewing system. Blum opened a second Bad Martha Farmer‚Äôs Brewery in September of 2019 in Falmouth, MA. This second brewery is bigger and has a 15-barrel brewing system that can expand to 30-barrels of production. It has a state-of-the-art canning line so their products have wider availability throughout the mainland and on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard.

Bad Martha Farmer‚Äôs Brewery is known for Bad Martha Beer which can be identified by a sensual dark haired mermaid logo. The legend of Bad Martha is on the Company‚Äôs website. The mermaid once lured 17th century explorer Bartholomew Gosnold to ‚Äúa field brimming with lush island grapes‚Äù on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard. Being a good Englishman, Gosnold decided to use the grapes as a secret ingredient in the ale he brewed for his crew. Today, Bad Martha brews its beer as Gosnold did with wild grape leaves hand-picked on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard. The Bad Martha Farmer‚Äôs Brewery motto is ‚ÄòGet Bad. Do Good.‚Äô Their mission is to create excellent craft beers and be a socially-responsible company that puts the community first. They donate the first portion of their profits to hunger- relief charities located where their beer is sold. They buy as many ingredients as possible from local farms and makers.

He mainly fought against Albanian kachaks. With the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912, he joined the Chetnik detachment of Vojislav Tankosiƒá and participated in fighting in Merdare, destroying the Ottoman border stations. In World War I he fought against the Austro-Hungarians in Belgrade, then was sent to his home region to monitor the IMRO. In 1915, with the fall of Serbia, the Bulgarians attacked Tetovo, killing Markoviƒá's horse, but he survived and escaped into Albania. He fought on the Macedonian front. During this time he married in Bitola, then returned to fighting in the north. When the war ended, he returned to his village, which was devastated, the houses having been burnt down by the Bulgarians.

The device is placed as an alternative to the traditional ventilator in patients with quadriplegia, central sleep apnea, diaphragm paralysis, and other respiration maladies, so long as the patient's respiratory system still has some residual function. The Mark IV Breathing Pacemaker is a phrenic nerve stimulator, also called a diaphragm pacemaker. Phrenic nerve stimulation is a technique whereby a nerve stimulator provides electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve to cause diaphragmatic contraction. It consists of surgically implanted receivers and electrodes mated to an external transmitter by antennas worn over the implanted receivers. An external battery-operated transmitter sends radiofrequency energy to the receiver through an antenna, which is placed on the skin overlying the receiver. The receiver converts this energy into an electric current that is directed to the phrenic nerve in order to stimulate the nerve, thereby causing contraction of the diaphragm. The surgery can be performed via either a cervical or thoracic approach. Phrenic pacing provides ventilatory support for patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency whose diaphragm, lungs, and phrenic nerves have residual function.

Tsunamis affect New Zealand's coastline reasonably frequently and tend to be caused by earthquakes on the Pacific Plate both locally and as far away as South America, Japan, and Alaska. Some have been attributed to undersea landslides, volcanoes, and at least one meteor strike. New Zealand is affected by at least one tsunami with the a wave height greater than one metre every ten years on average.Willem de Lange and Eileen McSaveney. 'Tsunamis - Tsunamis ‚Äì New Zealand's underrated hazard', Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 13-Jul-12 The history of tsunamis is limited by the country's written history only dating from the early to mid-1800s with MƒÅori oral traditions and paleotsunami research prior to that time. Studies are also being carried out into possible tsunamis on the larger inland lakes, particularly from landslides.Lake Tekapo chosen to probe risk to tsunamis on New Zealand lakes, One News, retrieved 30 March 2016 The Pacific Plate Tsunami travel times Frequency The predicted tsunami return periods for New Zealand based on all available data from 1840 are: 1 metre every 7.7 years, 2.5 metres every 10.6 years, 5 metres every 18.1 years, and 10 metres every 52.5 years.Table, Tsunami Hazard in New Zealand, Willem de Lange and Rodger Fraser, Tephra, Ministry for Emergency Management, October 1999, page 4 Significant tsunamis (greater than 1 metre)  Earthquake Major active fault zones of New Zealand showing variation in displacement vector of Pacific Plate relative to Australian Plate along the boundary =1135‚Äì1215 southern Hikurangi margin= Research indicates a tsunami of 3.3 metres struck the east coast of lower North Island and upper South Island from a megathrust earthquake on the southern Hikurangi Margin of the Pacific plate.Megaquake could hit central New Zealand, Paul Gorman and Michael Daly, Last updated 08:40, 19 May 2015 =1495‚Äì1545 southern Hikurangi margin= Research indicates a tsunami from a second mega-thrust earthquake on the southern Hikurangi margin of the Pacific plate struck the east coast of lower North Island and upper South Island. It was smaller than the 1135-1215 event. =1820 Southland tsunami= According to MƒÅori history several hundred KƒÅti MƒÅmoe MƒÅori were killed by a tsunami while walking along the beach near Orepuki in the 1820s. They had been gathering fish at the Waiau River mouth in autumn as provisions for the winter period. The beach runs between the sea and a line of cliffs meaning that only a moderate tsunami of 2‚Äì4 metres high would have been needed to cause so many deaths. The likely source of the tsunami could have been an earthquake on the Fiordland or Puysegur faults. There are questions around the exact date of this event as it is reliant entirely on unverified unnamed sources.EQC Project 03/490 - Understanding local source tsunami: 1820s Southland tsunami, G Downes et al, Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences client report 2005/153 - Project Number: 410W1034 and National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research Consultancy report HAM2005-135 - Project Number: EQC04201, November 2005 =1826 Fiordland earthquake and tsunami= In 1826 sealers in Dusky Sound experienced a large earthquake that had aftershocks that went into the following year. The earthquake descriptions are considered consistent with a 7.6 to 8 magnitude quake given the extent of landslides and uplift. A tsunami or seiche caused by the uplift impacted the area where the sealers were. Its size has not been determined but it must have been significant (greater than 1 metre) to concern the sealers. They thought the small island on which they were residing was going to be swamped. There are questions around the accuracy of the year this event occurred. Given that the earthquake responsible for this tsunami was felt as being violent by the sealers, it is unlikely to be the same tsunami as in the previous section, since in the earlier event was not foreshadowed by noticeable ground shaking. =1855 West Wairarapa= The uplift from the earthquake on 23 January 1855 tilted the Wellington Region and with it Wellington Harbour. The eastern side of the harbour moved 80 centimetres higher than the western side displacing the water into the shoreline along Lambton Quay and flooding its houses and shops.Editorial, Taranaki Herald, Volume III, Issue 133, 14 February 1855, Page 2 In Cook Strait there was a much greater displacement. The Remutaka Range had risen about 6 metres and with it, the floor of the strait had been uplifted. The exact maximum height of the tsunami was not known but sheds at Te Kopi, South Wairarapa, which were 8 metres above sea level were destroyed.Editorial, Taranaki Herald, Volume III, Issue 134, 21 February 1855, Page 3 The area impacted by the tsunami was as far north as Otaki and the upper South Island.The late earthquake, Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, Volume 712, Issue 712, 21 February 1855, Page 2 About 20 minutes after the earthquake a 3-4-metre high tsunami entered Wellington harbour through its narrow entrance and also across the Lyall Bay to Kilbirnie area.Editorial, Daily Southern Cross, Volume XII, Issue 804, 13 March 1855, Page 2 The water was about 1 metre deep across the area.

The tsunami created by the quake reached New Zealand 15 hours later and caused substantial damage on the Chatham Islands and Banks Peninsula. It also affected many areas along New Zealand's eastern coastline from Great Barrier Island to Bluff.Earthquake wave in the sea, Lyttelton Times, Volume XXX, Issue 2387, 17 August 1868, Page 2The earthquakes and tidal phenomena, Daily Southern Cross, Volume XXIV, Issue 3467, 26 August 1868, Page 3 The tide at Wellington and Port Chalmers was reported as rising and falling by over a metre for a space of about 2 hours.Editorial, Star, Issue 80, 15 August 1868, Page 2 The first area affected was the Chatham Islands where the tsunami struck at about 1am (New Zealand time) on 15 August. News of the effect on the Chathams did not reach the mainland until 27 August when the schooner Rifleman reached Port Chalmers. The MƒÅori village of Tupuangi was totally destroyed with only sand and seaweed marking its location. Fortunately the first wave was small enough to awaken the sleeping villagers enabling them to make it to safety. Subsequent waves carried out the destruction. Captain Anderson, who had a house about four miles from Tupuangi lost his house, but he and his family were able to reach safety. A MƒÅori drowned while trying to save Captain Anderson's boat that had come adrift. Thomas Hay, a local sheep farmer also lost all he had. Buildings at Waitangi were also damaged including Beamish's accommodation house and the Government store.Arrival of the schooner Rifleman from the Chatham Islands, Otago Daily Times, Issue 2048, 28 August 1868, Page 3 At about 4am Mr Webb, a railway night watchman noticed barque John Knox was lying on her broadside and nearly touching the jetty she was discharging her cargo on. He woke up Captain Jenkins her Captain and he found that the harbour between the wharf and Officers Point was dry. Minutes later there was a thundering noise from the direction of Officers Point and both she and Mr Webb saw an enormous wave powering its way into the harbour. The power and ferocity of the wave snapped a number of boats warps, snapped the John Knox's mooring chain and drove her into the jetty, dragged the ketch Margaret into the harbour where she fouled the schooner Annie Brown, damaged the schooner Jeanie Duncan and the steamer Novalty. The tide kept rising and falling in the harbour for some hours after the initial wave.Extrodinary tidal wave, Star, Issue 80, 15 August 1868, Page 3 The tsunami that entered the harbour has been estimated at 7 metres high but Captain Jenkins had referred to the wave as being 8 feet (2.5 metres) high when he saw it. The bays around Banks Peninsula were also impacted by the tsunami which penetrated far inland along valleys, damaging homes and carrying away bridges and fences. The ketch Georgina was wrecked at Rhodes Bay. At Pigeon Bay a succession of waves reaching up to two metres above the highest high water mark between 3am and 1pm carried away two jetties, 40,000 feet of sawn timber, a boat house, fencing, and the ketch Courier.Earthquake wave in the sea, Star, Issue 81, 17 August 1868, Page 3 On the Waimakariri River a 1.5-metre high wave washed up it at about 3am snapping the stern line on the SS Gazelle which caused her to swing around. The schooner Challenge broke away from her wharf and collided with the Gazelle. The William and Julia were lifted onto the river bank and the Nora and Dart broke free from their wharf. After the tsunami Ferdinand von Hochstetter undertook a detailed analysis of the tsunami. He charted its progress across the Pacific determining wave speeds and the ocean depth along several paths. It was the first detailed scientific analysis of a major tsunami. Dr Haast, a friend of von Hochstetter and fellow geologist, writing to the Star two days after the tsunami reached New Zealand pointed out that such waves travel at great speed and travel thousands of miles in a day.Untitled, Star, Issue 81, 17 August 1868, Page 3 In 1912 the Evening Post carried a letter which suggested Westport had been submerged under a 10-metre high wave, with the old township now lying metres under the sea. This story was later modified in the Colonist by its writer to being associated with the Arica earthquake with the sea at Westport receding some 7‚Äì8 metres and a returning wave of much less significance. the old days, Nelson Evening Mail, Volume XLVIII, 13 January 1914, Page 3Interesting reminiscences, Evening Post, Volume LXXXIV, Issue 37, 12 August 1912, Page 2 The original claims were repeated in a 2015 paper by Professor James Goff, of the University of New South Wales.West coast is tsunami 'blind spot' - new study, Ian Steward, Last updated 05:00, 23 March 2015 The Westport Times made no mention of the event in August 1868, other than the impact on other parts of New Zealand. =1868 east of New Zealand= A few days after the Arica tidal wave arrived on 17 August 1868 there was a sharp earthquake, felt at both Nelson and Wellington at 9:57 and 9:56am respectively. Both harbours reported tidal waves with the one at Nelson over-topping the Boulder Bank. The wave was estimated to be just over a metre in height. The paper also reported that the tidal wave had impacted numerous South Island ports. The earthquake was felt at Christchurch at 10:01am.Earthquakes and tidal waves in New Zealand, Colonist, Volume XI, Issue 1142, 4 September 1868, Page 3 Later reports indicated that the quake was felt almost simultaneously from Napier to Port Chalmers.Remarkable tidal waves, Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, Volume XXVII, 5 September 1868, Page 2 =1877 Iquique= On 10 May 1877 at 0:59 UTC a magnitude 8.5 earthquake occurred near Iquique Peru (now Chile). The tsunami created by this quake reached New Zealand eastern coastline at between 7 and 8am NZDT on 11 May. The wave had a reported 1-2-metre height in most places and impacted the coast from the Bay of Islands to Bluff. It also reached Westport on the West Coast of New Zealand at 2:30pm.(Per Press Agency)], Evening Post, Volume XV, Issue 111, 12 May 1877, Page 2 At Akaroa and Gisborne the wave was in the 2-3-metre range. At Port Charles on the Coromandal Peninsula the waves were reported being over 3 metres high.The tidal wave at Port Charles Auckland Star, Volume VIII, Issue 2244, 16 May 1877, Page 2 With the knowledge gained from the 1868 tsunami, newspapers of the day were already speculating that the source of the wave was from a South American earthquake.Great tidal wave, Auckland Star, Volume VIII, Issue 2240, 11 May 1877, Page 2Tidal wave on the New Zealand coast, Evening Post, Volume XV, Issue 110, 11 May 1877, Page 2 Their hypothesis was confirmed a couple of days later when news of the Iquique earthquake reached New Zealand.Editorial, Evening Post, Volume XV, Issue 113, 15 May 1877, Page 2 =1913 Westport= On 22 February 1913 a 1 metre high tsunami followed a local magnitude 6.8 earthquake.New Zealand tsunamis 1840-1982, De Lange and Healy, Table 1, New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, 1986, vol 29 page 116 Newspapers at the time seem to indicate a very limited impact to the tidal portion of the Buller River.Earthquake, Nelson Evening Mail, Volume XLVIII, 24 February 1913, Page 5 =1929 Whitecliffs, Karamea= On 17 June 1929 a 2.5-metre high tsunami was generated by the magnitude 7.8 Murchison earthquake. =1931 Napier= The earthquake triggered a landslip at Waikare which in turn caused a localised 15.3-metre tsunami. At Napier there was a tsunami of about 3 metres. =1946 Aleutian Islands= A 1 metre high tsunami was said to have reached Northland from the Aleutian Island earthquake. =1947 Gisborne= - 26 March On 26 March 1947 at 8:32am NZST Gisborne had what felt like a minor earthquake. Within 30 minutes the coast from Muriwai to Tolaga Bay experienced a tsunami which peaked at 10 metres high at Turihaua. At Tatapouri Point four people at the nearby hotel escaped by getting to high ground. Two waves drove through the hotel ground floor at up to window sill height and a number of small buildings were washed away. Two men in a cottage at Turihaua were swept inland onto the coast road. The cottage was totally destroyed, except for the kitchen they were in. Other damage included the Pouawa River bridge which was swept 600 metres inland, a house at Te Mahanga Beach which was swept off its piles, and six hectares of pumpkins at Murphy's Beach. No one was killed. The quake that caused the tsunami was 7-7.1 magnitude off-shore near Poverty Bay. - 17 May On 17 May 1947 another tsunami hit the coast between Gisborne and Tolaga Bay with a maximum height of 6 metres north of Gisborne. Again there were no casualties. Also the impact of this tsunami was less than earlier one because it occurred near low tide. The earthquake responsible for it was a 6.9-7.1 magnitude quake off-shore near Tolaga Bay. =1960 Chile= A tsunami generated by the Mw 9.5 Valdivia earthquake of 23 May 1960, 7:11pm (NZST) was reported at more than 120 locations in New Zealand during the early morning. As with the other earlier 1868 and 1877 Chilean tsunamis the eastern coast of New Zealand from Cape Reinga to Stewart Island was impacted. More unusually, effects of the tsunami was also observed on the west coast of both islands, including Ahipara, Whanganui, Paremata, Nelson, Motueka, and several West Coast (South Island) towns. At the Chatham Islands and Campbell Island water heights above sea level ranged from 3 metres to over 5 metres. Surprisingly the tsunami did not affect New Plymouth, Foxton, or Himatangi Beach. The largest and most damaged waves were generally within 12 to 15 hours after the first ones although some were within the first 2‚Äì4 hours. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center alerted New Zealand authorities of the approaching tsunami prompting the first major tsunami evacuation in New Zealand. Port facilities along the east coast of New Zealand were cleared, schools in coastal areas closed and Whitianga, Mercury Bay, Waihi Beach, WhakatƒÅne, ≈åhope, ≈åp≈çtiki and Kaik≈çura evacuated. =2016 Kaikoura= A tsunami, caused by the Kaikoura earthquake, of was said to have been recorded at Kaikoura. Investigation revealed that the tsunami was 1 metre high the nearest recording point. At Little Pigeon Bay on Banks Peninsula, the tsunami reached 4.1 metres above sea level, extensively damaging an unoccupied beachside cottage. It also travelled 140 metres up a creek adjacent to the cottage.More info on the impact of Monday's tsunami, Geonet, retrieved 22 November 2016 Landslide Sonar mapping has found the presence of massive submarine landslides near the New Zealand coast that would have triggered large localised tsunamis. =1927‚Äì1928 Tolaga Bay= Three large waves greater than 4 metres high over the period 1927 to 1928. Possibly landslip related. No reference to these events were found in the newspapers of the day. =1987 Doubtful Sound= A 3-metre high localised tsunami was caused by a landslide into Deep Cove, Doubtful Sound in May 1987. =2003 Charles Sound= During the magnitude 7 23 August 2003 Fiordland earthquake, a significant landslide swept in to Charles Sound causing a 4 to 5 metres high tsunami that damaged a wharf and helipad in the Sound. This tsunami from this landslide was localised to several hundred metres of coastline. There was also a small tsunami caused by the deformation of the coast recorded 190 km away at Jackson Bay of 0.3 metres and at Port Kembla, New South Wales of 0.17 metres. Volcano = 180 Taupo= Although an inland eruption, the Taupo eruption is considered to have caused an atmospheric pressure wave of sufficient magnitude to cause a tsunami. Radiocarbon dating of prehistoric tsunami in the Cook Strait area indicates a possible correlation with one such event. =1360 Healy= There is evidence of a tsunami in the Bay of Plenty from the Healy volcanic eruption. =1883 Krakatoa= The Krakatoa eruption generated a rissaga of up to 2 metres high on the New Zealand Coast. Meteor =Eltanin= Before this the Eltanin impact in the eastern part of the South Pacific Ocean during the late Pliocene 2.51 ¬± 0.07 million years ago was believed to have caused a significant mega-tsunami along New Zealand's coastline. =Mahuika= There is disputed historic evidence that a mega-tsunami with a wave height of greater than 30 metres could have struck Stewart Island in the 15th century. This has been attributed to a meteor impact. This event has been controversially linked by author Gavin Menzies with a disaster which reputedly hit a Chinese exploration fleet in 1422.Chapter 22 ‚Äì Tragedy on the high seas: Zheng He's fleets destroyed by a tsunami, www.gavinmenzies.net, 31 August 2011.

Unknown cause =200, 800, and 1600 East Coast, North Island= A study of Puatai Beach on the East Coast of the North Island in 2016 identified three or four large tsunamis with waves between 9 and 12 metres had impacted the East Coast. While they are likely to have been from earthquakes the exact cause and timing has yet to be determined.Study shows three huge tsunamis have hit east coast in past 1200 years, Marty Sharpe, Stuff, Last updated 13:07, 11 August 2016, retrieved 11 August 2016 =1320‚Äì1450 Western Waikato= A tsunami event sometime between 1320 and 1450 is believed to have impacted 150 km of the Western Waikato coastline. It is suspected to have been caused by a submarine slope failure of the Aotea Seamount which is located about 240 km west of Raglan. Evidence of the tsunami came from marine gravel deposits at 32 sites north along the coast from Awakino. However, a study published in 2016 says, \\"it is very difficult to reconcile the geologic evidence presented by Goff and Chagu√©-Goff (2015) suggestive of 30 to 60 m tsunami runup heights along the coast of south west Waikato with numerical modelling of potential tsunami source\\". A MƒÅori legend called \\"Coming of the Sand\\" from the New Plymouth area describes possibly a tsunami inundating the inland area and depositing it with a thick layer of sand. =1470‚Äì1510 South Taranaki Bight= The tsunami that occurred between 1470 and 1510 was associated with the South Taranaki Bight possibly extended down to Abel Tasman National Park. Evidence of this tsunami came from D'Urville and Kapiti Islands, and Waitori in South Taranaki =1500s= MƒÅori moved their settlements from low-lying coastal areas inland and onto hill tops. The cause of this change in settlement pattern is believed to have been tsunamis. Archaeological examination of the coastal settlements shows tsunami damage in many places. This may be linked to the previously mentioned Mahuika crater meteor event. =1800s= In what is believed to have been the early 1800s, Moawhitu, a MƒÅori village on D'Urville Island was wiped out by, in MƒÅori oral traditions, a large wave which is now presumed to have been a tsunami. This event is undated. =1924 Chatham Islands= On 19 July 1924 about 7:15pm (NZMT) the northern and eastern side of Chatham Island and Pitt Island were struck by a series of waves that reached 6 metres above the high water mark. The waves reached 100 metres inland at Kaingaroa destroying a dam and two trawlers. At Wharekauri a bridge was badly damaged and fences washed away. Te Awanui island was inundated and at Owenga several boats and some shell crushing machinery was damaged. A small hut was also washed away. On Pitt Island the wharf was destroyed and on Mangere Island there was a large landslide. The source of the tsunami is unknown, it could have been caused by either a landslide or an unidentified earthquake. The Chatham Islands steam ship Tees was struck on its starboard side by the wave at 9:30am and almost capsized.A close call, Press, Volume LX, Issue 18141, 2 August 1924, Page 14 There was a sudden change in the weather to a southerly storm on the east coast of New Zealand on the day of the tsunami that may have masked its effect.The weather, Press, Volume LX, Issue 18130, 21 July 1924, Page 10 Minor tsunamis (less than 1 metre) from significant earthquakes There have been numerous minor tsunamis caused by significant large earthquakes.

It has been suggested that this movement was caused by tsunamis. Initial European settlement was unaware of the tsunami danger until the 1868 and 1877 tsunamis. No warning systems became available until after the 1946 Aleutian earthquake when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre was established in 1949. New Zealand became a member of the Centre and receives warnings of tsunamis caused by distant earthquakes. The Pacific Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System was established in 1965 due to the 1960 Chile tsunami. New Zealand is one of the 46 member countries. Tsunamis from these may arrive within a few minutes and this is not enough time for GeoNet to locate the event, determine if it could produce a tsunami, and notify the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management who issue the warnings. On 2 September 2016 Civil Defence took over an hour to warn of a potential tsunami from a 7.1 magnitude earthquake centered 125 km north-east of Te Araroa prompting calls for the warning system to be improved.Philip Duncan: Civil Defence's big long silence (again) - The simple fix for future tsunami risks, Philip Duncan, New Zealand Herald, Auckland, 12:25 PM Friday 2 Sep 2016, retrieved 2 September 2016 Differing approaches to tsunami warning sirens are taken on a regional level.

The parish was in the Hundred of Dewisland and includes the settlements of Llangloffan and Tregwynt, with Tregwynt woollen mill. Granston is in the community of Pencaer. Name The Welsh name of the hamlet, Treopert, suggests an association with a Robert, possibly Robert FitzMartin of Cemais. In 1292 the village was referred to (Latin) as \\"Villa Grandi\\", and in 1535 as \\"Grandiston\\" (Grand's Farm), possibly a reference to a French name, Grand. History Prehistoric remains were noted in the parish in 1920. The earliest church records of the parish are from 1291 and 1326. The parish was attached to the crown after the Dissolution. There was an Episcopal court at Granston. The size of the parish is . There are a number of listed buildings in the parish and, following the change from civil parishes to communities, Granston became part of the community of Pencaer. Population Granston parish in 1833 had a population of 195. The population in 1872 was 156 people occupying 31 houses. Analysis of the 1881 census found that the four most frequently-occurring surnames in the parish (67 of 175 inhabitants) were Davies, Evans, Thomas and Williams. Places of worship River baptismal pool, Pont Llangloffan The parish was annexed to that of Mathry and the church dedicated to St Catherine (sometimes recorded as Katherine), one of only three mediaeval churches in Wales to be dedicated to the saint. When the church was visited by the Royal Commission in 1920 it was found to have been constructed in 1877 with no evidence of the mediaeval structure save an octagonal font probably from the 14th century. However, the diocesan description notes that the foundations are mediaeval. The parish includes the hamlet of Llangloffan, where there is a Baptist chapel. The original chapel was built in 1706, restored in 1749 and 1791 and rebuilt in 1862. There is no baptismal pool at the chapel, baptisms being performed at a specially constructed site in the Western Cleddau at Pont Llangloffan, south of the hamlet. Llangloffan is the name of a Welsh hymn melody (composer unknown). Archives for both churches are kept by Dyfed Family History Society. Tregwynt Melin Tregwynt woollen mill Granston includes the estate of Tregwynt, whose papers are held by the Pembrokeshire Record Office. In the 14th century Sir William Horton of Tregwynt married the heiress to Candleston Castle. The Tregwynt Hoard, from the Civil War, was found at Tregwynt Mansion in 1996. The present Grade II*-listed manor house and extensions date from the 18th century. Tregwynt mill (Melin Tregwynt) dates back to the 17th century when it served the surrounding area‚Äôs sheep farming. It is still in operation, employing about 30 people, and in 2012 celebrated 100 years as a family business, now weaving for a global market. The mill featured in a BBC2 Wales Made in Wales episode in December 2012. Llangloffan Llangloffan hamlet is south of Granston. Close by the source of the Western Cleddau river, the Llangloffan Fen includes a National Nature Reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Llangloffan lends its name to a range of Welsh farmhouse cheeses; the brand was acquired by Carmarthenshire Cheese Company in 2006. References Further reading *Coggins, Julie.

Described as a \\"point-and-click thriller\\", the game revolves around a core mechanic of resource and time management, in which the player is placed in various scenarios and tasked to avert a crisis. The iOS port of Gods Will Be Watching was released on 17 December 2015.  Gameplay  Gods Will Be Watching is a point-and-click adventure game with emphasis on the player's decision making. It features six chapters, each of which acts as a resource and time management puzzle. The player's goal in each chapter is to lead a group of characters through various circumstances in a fixed amount of time, often having to make moral decisions. The player can click on the ground to move, and on other characters to speak with them and give them orders. Options given to the player include, for example, choosing to kill a group member in order to reserve rations for the rest of the group.  Plot  The game is set in a far future science fiction setting, playing in 2257 CFD (Constellar Federation Date), with the player assuming the role of an agent of the neutral organization known as Everdusk Company for the Universe Knowledge (E.C.U.K.), Sgt. Burden. The first chapter begins with Burden infiltrating the idealistic resistance movement known as Xenolifer, with his task being to aid in a hacking operation.  Development  Gods Will Be Watching was originally developed as an entry for the Ludum Dare game jam #26, the theme being minimalism. The original version was created across a span of 72 hours and featured a single scenario, akin to a chapter in the final game. It ranked second place in the competition, losing to Leaf Me Alone by Mark Foster and David Fenn. After the development competition, Deconstructeam launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo for the development of a full game, with a goal of 8,000 ‚Ç¨. The campaign ended on 15 August 2013, having raised 20,385 ‚Ç¨. The game was released worldwide on 24 July 2014, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. An epilogue was added to the game as a free download in May 2015. As the game was already announced for a release on iOS and Android, Abstraction Games took on the development of the game's mobile versions, where the Android release date is still to be announced.  Reception  Gods Will Be Watching has received mixed reviews. Critics praised it for its minimalist pixel art style, interesting story, and novel take on adventure games, but criticism was levied for its repetitiveness, tediousness, and excessive challenge. The primary concern of reviewers was the trial and error nature of the gameplay and the lack of checkpoints, requiring multiple, time-consuming attempts at single scenarios. Rowan Kaiser of IGN praised the game's simplicity and tense story, calling it \\"a demonstration that even with the simplest of interfaces and old-fashioned graphics, new combinations of storytelling with gameplay are possible.\\"  References   External links  Gods Will Be Watching at Devolver Digital * Gods Will Be Watching Ludum Dare development page at Deconstructeam * Gods Will Be Watching post-Ludum Dare development page at Deconstructeam * Gods Will Be Watching at Ludum Dare 2014 video games Android (operating system) games Devolver Digital games GameMaker Studio games Indie video games IOS games Linux games Ludum Dare video games MacOS games Point-and-click adventure games Science fiction video games Video games developed in Spain Windows games ","title":"Gods Will Be Watching"},{"id":"46493499","text":"\\"Railroad Track\\" is a song by New Zealand-born musician, singer and producer Willy Moon released in 2012 by Jack White's label Third Man Records.http://thirdmanstore.com/willy-moon-railroad-track-7-vinyl The B-side is written by Sonny Bono in 1966 and first performed by Cher.

Born in St. Petersburg, he was the only child of Franz Joseph, 8th Prince of Dietrichstein, and Countess Alexandra Andrejevna Shuvalova. Life Shortly after the birth of Joseph Franz, the marriage of his parent ended. His mother moved to Italy, where she remained the rest of her life. The child was left under the care of his father, who raised him with English views, which are considered at that time as the most progressive. Franz Joseph studied in Prague and Viena, where he attended to lectures of the called \\"Austrian Bolzano\\", Vincenz Weindtridta, later provost of Nikolsburg.} Shortly after his marriage in 1821, Joseph Franz received from his father the Bohemian states of the family, and thanks to this he was one of the members of the family who became more close to the Czech nobility. Often stayed in Prague, he came into contact with Czech patriots and his ideas. Joseph Franz was one of the initiators of the Unity to encourage industry in the Czech Republic (Jednota ku povzbuzen√≠ pr≈Ømyslu v ƒåech√°ch), which was founded in Prague on 1 March 1833, and during 1833-1840 he was his President. He further participated in the associational Prague life: he was a member of the Economic Company (Hospod√°≈ôsk√© spoleƒçnosti) and the Society of the National Museum of the Kingdom of Bohemia (kr√°lovstv√≠ ƒçesk√©ho a Spoleƒçnosti vlasteneck√©ho muzea kr√°lovstv√≠ ƒçesk√©ho). An avid collector of art and paintings, when he assumed the title of Prince of Dietrichstein after his father's death (10 July 1854), he called from Prague the sculptor Emanuel Max to create his sculpture, which was placed after his completion in the Hall of Ancestors at Nikolsburg Castle. Having fathered only four daughters and also neither of his male relatives had surviving male issue, in the 1850s for Joseph Franz was clear that the House of Dietrichstein was doomed to extinction. In 1856, he entered into an agreement with the last surviving male of the family, his uncle Moritz about the future of the family's heritage. Moritz, following the primogeniture, assumed the succession of the princely title, but the lands and properties where divided among the four daughters of Joseph Franz. During a visit to his youngest daughter, Joseph Franz died at Fr√Ωdlant Castle in 1858, aged 60. He was buried in the family crypt at Nikolsburg Castle. Marriage and Issue On 21 February 1821, Joseph Franz married with Gabriela Antonia Maria Apollonia Johanna Nepomuzena Felizitas (2 November 1804 ‚Äì 22 September 1880), a daughter of Josef Anton√≠n, Count Wratislav of Mitrowic and Countess Marie Gabriele Valentine des Fours. They had four daughters: * Theresia (15 October 1822 ‚Äì 12 March 1895), married on 15 November 1849 to Count Johann Frederick of Herberstein. She inherited the Fideikomiss received from Gundacar of Dietrichstein in 1690, who contained, among other things, Libochovice Palace and the Austrian estates in Vienna, in addition with Doln√≠ Kounice, Ptuj Castle in Slovenia and the Hungarian estates. * Alexandrine Maria (28 February 1824 ‚Äì 22 February 1906), married on 28 April 1857 to Count Alexander of Mensdorff-Pouilly. She inherited the most important assets: Nikolsburg (for centuries the seat of the family) with his castle, another palaces in Vienna and the Weidlingau villa. * Gabriele (8 December 1825 ‚Äì 24 December 1909), married on 1 September 1852 to Count (later Prince) Alfred of Hatzfeld-Wildenburg. She inherited Lipn√≠k nad Beƒçvou, Hranice na Moravƒõ with the rest of the Moravian estates. * Clothilde (26 June 1828 ‚Äì 31 October 1899), married on 28 April 1850 to Count Eduard of Clam- Gallas. She inherited the Bohemian estates: ≈Ωƒè√°r nad S√°zavou and P≈ôibyslav, along with the Dietrichstein Palace in W√§hringer Strasse, Vienna. An important and extensive ancestral graphic collection, which dates have not yet been processed, where inherited by both Theresia and Gabriele. The four sisters also shared a collection of paintings and family portraits later held in Vienna. The core of the family portraits, however, remained intact at Nikolsburg Castle. In late 1868, Alexandrine's husband, Count Alexander of Mensdorff-Pouilly, obtained from the Emperor the title of Prince of Dietrichstein-Nikolsburg, thus reviving the title of his wife's family. The title of Count of Proskau passed to the only son of Theresia, who in 1896 changed his title to Count of Herberstein-Proskau.

It is a well known garden shrub featuring dark green leaves against light-coloured foliage, many twisted branches and profuse heads of bright pink \\"pom pom\\" flower heads in spring or early summer. Description Melaleuca spathulata is a shrub with light grey, papery bark which grows to a height of . Its branches are often twisted and mostly glabrous. The leaves are arranged alternately, well-spaced along the branchlets, long, wide, egg-shaped to spoon-shaped and tapering to a point. The leaves have a mid-vein and a number of indistinct parallel veins. The flowers are a shade of pink to purple and are arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, and sometimes in the upper leaf axils. The spikes contain 2 to 9 groups of flowers in threes and are up to in diameter and long. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and each bundle contains 2 to 5 (mostly 3) stamens. Flowering occurs between September and January and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long in almost spherical clusters which are up to in diameter. M. spathulata leaves and flowers M. spathulata fruit Taxonomy Melaleuca spathulata was first formally described in 1844 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet (spathulata) is from the Ancient Greek œÉœÄŒ¨Œ∏Œ∑ (spath√™) meaning \\"broad blade\\" or \\"paddle for stirring and mixing\\" referring to the spoon-like leaf shape. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca sieberi occurs in and between the Gnowangerup, Pingrup, Albany and Bremer Bay districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Warren biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy, clayey and gravelly soils in winter-wet areas and on low ridges. Conservation This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Melaleuca spathulata is well known in cultivation because of its interesting foliage and attractive heads of flowers. It prefers a sunny, well-drained position but will also grow in heavier soils. It is frost hardy and pest resistant, having been grown for more than ten years in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra. It is cultivated from seed or from cuttings taken when the new growth is beginning to harden.

Art and music played a central role in family affairs. The Prince zu Eulenburg-Hertefeld himself played and composed music and wrote poetry and romances (the famous Rosenlieder and Scandinavian Cantos) and was a friend and confidant of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who regularly visited Liebenberg. He supported his gifted son and daughter Victoria, familiarly called Tora, who was a pianist, and they grew up in a musical environment at the castle of Liebenberg Sigwart showed his musical talent at a young age, Already at seven he composed songs by ear and at eight years old he began music lessons in Munich and Vienna, devoting himself to musical composition and improvising at the piano, often when the emperor visited them at Liebenberg. Emperor Wilhelm even commissioned the eleven-year-old boy to compose variations on the Dessauer March, a composition for orchestra that was performed in the music salon in Vienna with Sigwart himself conducting. From 1898 he began to take lessons on the organ in Bunzlau with the city's cantor Wagner, who permitted him to select music for the church services. It was during this time that he published his first compendium of songs that he had written as a twelve-year- old, as well as a composition for orchestra that was performed in the hall of the music society in Vienna. In 1899 he left Bunzlau and returned to Liebenberg, receiving private tuition, completing his Abitur at the Friedrich- Wilhelm Gymnasium in Berlin Eulenburg studied History and Philosophy in Munich from 1902 onward, taking courses in counterpoint with Professor Ludwig Thuille and orchestral studies with the renowned Court Kapellmeister Zumpe. His vacations were spent at home in Liebenberg or travelling to cultivate his love for nature. At the invitation of Cosima Wagner, he was able to spend one summer at the Wagner festivals in Bayreuth with access to all the performances and sometimes standing in to conduct rehearsals. He submitted his dissertation on the Rothenburg ob der Tauber composer and organist Erasmus Widmann (1572‚Äì1634), spending many months in Rothenburg until obtaining his doctorate in 1907. Schloss Liebenberg, Lindenhaus Further studies and marriage Sigwart refused a post as kapellmeister in Colmar, organising a studio for himself at his home in Liebenberg where he could work in peace on his compositions. Besides this he continued with further studies under Max Reger in Leipzig. He laboured over his work on fugues, complaining to his godfather and mentor Cuno, Count of Moltke: \\"The fugue might be an artistic composition and one can write beautiful music by means of the fugue, but it is nevertheless true slavery for the man gifted with fantasy.\\" Reger, his teacher, to whom he also confided this sentiment, countered, \\"When you have written 300 fugues, as I have, you will also be able to move freely within this form as within any other.\\" Apart from his diverse social life and wide circle of friends including, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and Professor Arthur Nikisch, the artist continued to study the great philosophers and the different world religions. Through the family‚Äôs acquaintance with Dr. Rudolf Steiner, who occasionally stayed at Liebenberg, Sigwart encountered Anthroposophy. In addition to studying the basic works of Anthroposophy, he often attended Steiner‚Äôs lectures. together with his sisters Lycki and Tora, his brother Karl, and his sister-in-law Marie. In the meanwhile Sigwart had come to know the Kammers√§ngerin Helene Staegemann (1877‚Äì1923), daughter of the Leipzig theatre director Max Staegemann and his wife, the violinist Hildegard Kirchner. Her brother was the celebrated operatic baritone and actor Waldemar Staegemann and she came from the well-known artist family Devrient. Directly after having been instructed in Voice by her father, she began her stage career in Berlin, Vienna and Prague, becoming a celebrated interpreter of song compositions with composers such as Carl Reinecke und Hans Pfitzner dedicating compositions to her. She and Sigwart were married on 21 September 1909 in Leipzig.Article Helene Staegemann Wikipedia.de Helene Gr√§fin zu Eulenburg, geb.

He began a course of further instruction on the Organ with Albert Schweitzer, whom he sought out in Strassbourg and to whom he dedicated his composition for organ (op. 12). Then in May 1911 they undertook a journey through Greece and were deeply impressed by the holy places of antiquity. Sigwart made extensive notes in his diary, which he reworked musically on their return to Germany. His melodrama for orchestra The Funeral of Hector, with words taken from the Iliad (op. 15) was performed with considerable success in Leipzig and Dresden and led to a commission by the conductor and director of the Leipzig Conservatory, Arthur Nikisch (1855‚Äì1922), for a symphony for orchestra. For several years, however, Sigwart had been thinking about composing an opera. Having been alerted to the texts of Euripides by his early music teacher, Count Sporck, Sigwart withdrew for a period in 1912 and 1913 to his family residence Hertefeld Castle by the Rhine to work on it in solitude. The Songs of Euripides, as it was called, was accepted as a work in the spring of 1913 by the Staatstheater Stuttgart. After a labour of one and a half years, it was to be the only opera he composed, its completion coinciding with the birth of his only son Friedrich Max Donatus Sigwart on 19 February 1914. Battle and fall on the Eastern Front A few months later Sigwart volunteered for active service first in Flanders and France, where he still managed to complete his Sonata for Piano, the Kreigssonate (op. 19) and thereafter in Galicia, where his regiment was transferred in April 1915. By now a lieutenant and bearer of the Iron Cross, he was wounded by a shot that pierced his lung. He was no longer able to experience the highly acclaimed premier of his opera at the Staatstheater in Stuttgart, succumbing to his wound on 2 June 1915 in a field hospital in Jaslo. He lies buried on the estate of Liebenberg. His widow survived him by eight years, his son Friedrich, also a brilliant young musician, was accidentally killed in 1936 during a reserve duty training exercise at the age of 22. Post-mortem communications Between 1970 and 1972 three volumes of communications between Sigwart, his sisters Lycky and Tora and sister-in-law Marie appeared in publication under the title Br√ºcke √ºber den Strom, published in English as Bridge over the River. They contain notes of the three women of messages he transmitted to them over the following years describing his experiences on the other side of the so-called threshold of death. On first receiving these communications, the recipients sought out Rudolf Steiner to question him as to their authenticity. He advised them to take careful notes and these they made available to be published many years later.Br√ºcke √ºber den Strom Oratio Verlag; Auflage: 6., Aufl. (29. April 2009) The relationship to Anthroposophy continued in the family subsequently and Sigwart's older brother, the later Prince Friedrich Wend zu Eulenburg was one of the influential signatories to the petition to release the priests of the Christian Community, who had been interned by the Gestapo in 1941.Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (1933-1945) Uwe Werner, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag 24.

Google Fi uses networks operated by T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular. Google Fi is a service for US residents only, as of late 2019. The service was launched for the Nexus 6, by invitation only, on April 22, 2015. The service was opened to the public on March 7, 2016, and support for additional devices, including the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, was introduced on October 4, 2016. On November 28, 2018, Google rebranded Project Fi as Google Fi and added support for more phones, including iPhones. Google Fi automatically switches between networks depending on signal strength and speed. It can automatically connect to Wi-Fi hotspots with encryption through an automatic VPN. Phone calls transition between Wi-Fi and cellular networks. With all networks combined, the service covers more than 170 countries around the world. A subscription costs $20 per month for unlimited calls and messaging, plus a customizable data allowance costing an additional $10 per gigabyte. Money for unused data is credited back to the user's account, and overuse of data costs an additional $10 per gigabyte. Google Fi currently offers a plan for current clients to share their own personal coupon code. Each referral code is worth $20 to the current client, and $20 for each new client signing up. A group plan costs an additional $15 per user per month, and offers features including data overview, data notifications, monthly allowances, and the ability to pause users' data usage. A data-only SIM card can be used on supported tablets, smartphones, and car modems (e.g., Volvo). A data-only sim will have access to data, but will not be able to make calls or transmit texts across cellular networks Google Fi now offers an 'Unlimited' Plan for its users for a flat rate of $70 per month with up to 22GB of high speed data. After 22GB, speeds are throttled to 256kbps. On both plans, users can pay an additional $10 per 1GB until their next billing cycle.  History  Google Fi was announced exclusively for the Nexus 6 smartphone on April 22, 2015, with support for Sprint and T-Mobile. Due to high demand at launch, the service required that users receive invitations, which were gradually released throughout summer 2015. The invitation system was dropped on March 7, 2016. U.S. Cellular was added on June 8, 2016. Three was added on July 12, 2016. In October 2016, Google added support for the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, and later introduced a Group Plan, letting subscribers add extra members to their plans. On January 17, 2018, Google Fi announced bill protection which caps the charge for data at $60. If the data used is greater than 15GB, then Fi may slow the data speed to 256kbps. The user can avoid the slowdown by paying full price for the data used at $10 per GB. Bill protection also works with group plans, with a maximum charge of $85 for two people, $120 for three people, and $140 for four people. The rate for unlimited calls and texting is not affected by bill protection.  Features  Google Fi automatically switches between networks depending on signal strength and speed. It can automatically connect to open Wi-Fi hotspots while securing data with encryption through an automatic VPN. Phone calls will seamlessly transition to a cellular network if Wi-Fi coverage is lost. Google Fi users can use Google Hangouts on any phone, tablet, or computer to call and text. Google Fi also supports VoLTE as part of a staged rollout. With all of its networks combined, Google Fi's service covers more than 200 countries and territories around the world.  Plans  Monthly plans are flat fee‚Äìbased, paid at the beginning of each monthly billing cycle. It starts at $20 per month for unlimited calls and messaging. Money for unused data is credited back to the user's account, while overuse of data results in a charge of $10 per gigabyte. When outside the United States, cellular phone calls cost $0.20 per minute, data costs the same $10 per gigabyte (i.e. there are no extra data charges outside of the US), and texting is free. Data is free at full speeds between 6GB to 15GB for the duration of the billing cycle with Bill Protection. After 15GB, data continues to be free but will be throttled to unspecified speeds. A data-only SIM card can be used on tablets and other compatible devices, including the 2013 Nexus 7, Nexus 9, and iPad Air 2. The devices must be compatible with the T-Mobile network, and users can add up to 4 data-only SIM cards in one account (before July 2019 the limit was 9 data- only SIM cards in one account). A Group Plan, which allows users, referred to as \\"managers\\", to add other people, referred to as \\"members\\", to their subscription, costs an additional $15 per user. Group Plans let managers view data usage by member, set data notifications, add monthly allowances, and pause members' data usage. In June 2017, Group Plans were updated to feature \\"Group Repay\\", in which Project Fi automatically calculates each of the members' individual shares of the bill and allows for easy payments. Such payments can be a fixed amount, an individual's total usage, or only for data usage above the standard data allotment.

He had two brothers Matteo and Ottaviano Canevari, who were dedicated to trade and the laws. Canevari made his studies first in Pavia and then in Rome. He was graduated in medicine on April 7, 1581 in Genoa. He returned to Rome in 1581, where was member of the papal court and became the personal doctor of the Pope and his courtiers. In Rome he performed the functions in the art of medicine by forty years. Canevari has authored several books of natural philosophy and medicine. His works include De ligno sancto commentarium (1602), Ars medica seu Curandorum morborum (1625), De primis rerum natura factarum principiis commentarius: (1626), and Morborum Omnium Qui Corpus Humanum Affligunt, Vt Decet, & Ex Arte Curandorum Accurata, & Plenissima Methodus (1626).

June 26, 1917) was a Serbian intelligence agent. He was best known for allegedly helping the Black Hand in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which initiated World War I. Agram Trials Rade Malobabiƒá was one of the high profile members of the 53 defendants tried for High Treason in Zargeb between 1907 and 1909. Among 31 others Rade was found guilty and sentenced to hard labour for an extended term. The subsequent appeal being successful and the parallel Friedjung Process proving the evidence against Malobabiƒá and his fellow defendants to have been fabricated led to the state dropping the charges and releasing all 31 remaining accused in 1910. Military career Malobabiƒá was a Serbian military intelligence operative who was stationed in Austria leading up to World War I. He also worked with the Serbian deliberation group, the Black Hand, which was the group that was responsible for assassinating Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Assassination of the Archduke According to the final confession of Colonel Apis (which was extracted under torture and deception) Malobabiƒá was hired by Apis to organize the assassination of the Archduke, and perform tasks such as smuggling weapons and providing information to other operatives that were a part of the killing mission. He is noteworthy as the only person accused of specific involvement in the assassinations of June 28, 1914, not to have been named by a single defendant nor by any of the counsel in the Sarajevo trial - indeed the only individual to ever link Malobabiƒá to the murders is Apis and only then in his third and final statement on the matter 11th April 1917. In 1916 Malobabiƒá broke after being tortured and accused Apis of plotting the whole scheme to assassinate Prince Alexander - he never admitted any involvement in Sarajevo. Statement of Colonel Dimitrijeviƒá 11th April 1917: \\"As the Chief of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff, I engaged Rade Malobabic to organize the information service in Austria-Hungary. I took this step in agreement with the Russian Military Attach√© Artamonov, who had a meeting with Rade in my presence. Feeling that Austria was planning a war with us, I thought that the disappearance of the Austrian Heir Apparent would weaken the power of the military clique he headed, and thus the danger of war would be removed or postponed for a while. I engaged Malobabic to organize the assassination on the occasion of the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo. I made up my mind about this only when Artamonov assured me that Russia would not leave us without protection if we were attacked by Austria. On this occasion I did not mention my intention for the assassination, and my motive for asking his opinion about Russia‚Äôs attitude was the possibility that Austria might become aware of our activities, and use this as a pretext to attack us. Malobabic executed my order, organized and performed the assassination. His chief accomplices were in my service and received small payments from me. Some of their receipts are in the hands of the Russians, since I got money for this purpose from Mr. Artamonov, as the General Staff did not have funds available for this increased activity.\\" Death Apis had adopted Malobabiƒá as his aide most probably in light of the suffering the man had incurred following his incarceration from 1907 to 1910. However, this association proved fatal for Malobabiƒá who openly blamed Apis for his impending death as he stood awaiting execution. In December 1916, a number of alleged members of the Black Hand Gang were arrested by the Serbian military court in exile in Salonika and tried for an alleged plot against Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. It is commonly held that the trials were an attempt of appeasement of the Habsburg royal family and conducted in hope that the Habsburgs would declare peace with Serbia. Malobabiƒá was named as the primary assassin, while Apis and Mohamed Mehmedba≈°iƒá were among the accused.

In his research, Lemieux has frequently collaborated with David Card and Nicole Fortin.  Research on wages and wage inequality The main area of Lemieux's research has been the distribution and dynamics of wages. Studying the rise in wage inequality in the U.S. in the 1980s in a series of studies with John DiNardo and Nicole Fortin, Lemieux repeatedly emphasizes the importance labour market institutions, finding e.g. that about a third of the growth in male and female wage inequality can be attributed to deunionization for men and to the minimum wage for women, with economic deregulation having a comparatively small impact;DiNardo, J., Fortin, N. M., Lemieux, T. (1996). Labor market institutions and the distribution of wages, 1973-1992: A semiparametric approach. Econometrica, 64(5), pp. 1001-1044.Fortin, N. M., Lemieux, T. (1997). Institutional changes and rising wage inequality: Is there a linkage? Journal of Economic Perspectives, 11(2), pp. 75-96. moreover, the difference between the declines of the unionization rates in Canada and the U.S. are found to account for two-thirds of the growth differential in wage inequality between both.DiNardo, J., Lemieux, T. (1997). Diverging male wage inequality in the United States and Canada, 1981-1988: Do institutions explain the difference? ILR Review, 50(4), pp. 629-651. Further work with David Card, Francis Kramarz, John Abowd and David Margolis studied differences between the labour market institutions in the U.S., Canada and France in the 1980s, notably the causes of changes in the relative structure of wages and employment and the effect of the minimum wage on youth employment.Card, D., Kramarz, F., Lemieux, T. (1996). Changes in the relative structure of wages and employment: A comparison of the United States, Canada, and France. NBER Working Paper Series, No. 5487.Abowd, J. M. et al. (1997). Minimum wages and youth employment in France and the United States. NBER Working Paper Series, No. 6111. Moreover, in studies with Card and Fortin, Lemieux analysed the differentials between genders and racial groups in the U.S., with their findings emphasizing the role of changes in returns to skill and the link between female wage gains and male wage inequality.Card, D., Lemieux, T. (1996). Wage dispersion, returns to skill, and black-white wage differentials. Journal of Econometrics, 74(2), pp. 319-361.Fortin, N.M., Lemieux, T. (1998). Rank regressions, wage distributions, and the gender gap. Journal of Human Resources, pp. 610-643. In further work on unions, Lemieux argues that Canadian unions increase the average wage of workers and compress the returns to skills, and provides a comprehensive comparison of the effect of unionization on wage inequality in the U.S., Canada and UK (together with Card and W. Craig Riddell).Lemieux, T. (1998). Estimating the effects of unions on wage inequality in a panel data model with comparative advantage and nonrandom selection. Journal of Labor Economics, 16(2), pp. 261-291.Card, D., Lemieux, T., Riddell, W.C. (2004). Unions and wage inequality. Journal of Labor Research, 25(4), pp. 519-559. In another study with Card, Lemieux suggested that falling supply in highly educated workers may account for the growth in the return to college for younger men in the U.S., UK and Canada.Card, D., Lemieux, T. (2001). Can falling supply explain the rising return to college for younger men? A cohort-based analysis. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116(2), pp. 705-746. In the 2000s, Lemieux repeatedly highlighted the role of increased returns to postsecondary education and sophisticated institutional explanations (e.g. including performance pay, based on work with Bentley MacLeod and Daniel Parent) for the growth in wage inequality at the top of the wage distribution in the 1980s and 1990s, while arguing against simple models of skill-biased technological changeLemieux, T. (2006). Increasing residual wage inequality: Composition effects, noisy data, or rising demand for skill? American Economic Review, 96(3), pp. 461-498.Lemieux, T. (2006).

This empirical discussion was accompanied by various models advanced by Lemieux, e.g. - in joint work with Robert Gibbons, Lawrence Katz and Parent - of a model where a worker's skills are imperfectly observable but determine her current wage and sector, high-skill workers concentrate in high-wage sectors, thus earning high returns to their skills (with Robert Gibbons, Lawrence Katz and Daniel Parent).Gibbons, R. et al. (2005). Comparative advantage, learning, and sectoral wage determination. Journal of Labor Economics, 23(4), pp. 681-724.  Research on regression discontinuity and decomposition methods  Lemieux has contributed significantly to the methodological development of applied econometrics. Since the 2000s, he has repeatedly used regression discontinuity designs to analyze various economic issues. For example, in work with David Card that exploits the discontinuity in college enrollment rates due to U.S. high school graduates' attempt of avoiding the draft during the Vietnam War, Lemieux estimates that draft avoidance raised college attendance rates by 4-6%.Card, D., Lemieux, T. (2001). Going to college to avoid the draft: The unintended legacy of the Vietnam War. American Economic Review, 91(2), pp. 97-102. Similarly, in a study with Kevin Milligan that uses the discontinuity in Quebecois social assistance between childless recipients under and above age 30, Lemieux observes that the increase in social assistance benefits reduces employment by disincentivizing work.Lemieux, T., Milligan, K. (2008). Incentive effects of social assistance: A regression discontinuity approach. Journal of Econometrics, 142(2), pp. 807-828. Publications with Guido Imbens and David S. Lee, Lemieux further reviewed the use of regression discontinuity designs in economicsLee, D.S., Lemieux, T. (2010). Regression discontinuity designs in economics. Journal of Economic Literature, 48(2), pp. 281-355. and provides guidance for practitioners.Imbens, G.W., Lemieux, T. (2008). Regression discontinuity designs: A guide to practice. Journal of Econometrics, 142(2), pp. 615-635. Another key area of Lemieux's work in econometrics are decomposition methods, in particular related to comparisons between wage distributions and the analysis of their dynamics.Lemieux, T. (2002). Decomposing changes in wage distributions: A unified approach. Canadian Journal of Economics, 35(4), pp. 646-688. More recently, together with Sergio Firpo and Nicole Fortin, Lemieux has pioneered the use of recentered influence function (RIF) regressions, an extension of the Oaxaca- Blinder decomposition method which allows to study the impact of changes in the distribution of the explanatory variables on quantiles of the unconditional (marginal) distribution of an outcome variable.Firpo, S., Fortin, N.M., Lemieux, T. (2009). Unconditional quantile regressions. Econometrica, 77(3), pp. 953-973. While Lemieux, Firpo and Fortin originally used RIF regressions to analyze the polarization of male wages in the U.S. from the 1980s to the mid-2010s,Firpo, S., Fortin, N., Lemieux, T. (2018). Decomposing wage distributions using recentered influence function regressions. Econometrics, 6(2). their methodology has been adopted by other organizations, e.g. the ILO's 2018/19 Global Wage Report.ILO (2018). Global Wage Report 2018/19. Geneva: ILO. Another important application of RIFs by Lemieux, Firpo and Fortin is the analysis of the contributions of changes in the returns to occupational tasks to changes in the (U.S.) wage distribution, for which they find that wage polarization was driven by STBC and deunionization in the 1980s and 1990s, whereas offshorability of jobs became a major driver in the 1990s.Firpo, S., Fortin, N.M., Lemieux, T. (2011). Occupational tasks and changes in the wage structure. IZA Discussion Paper Series, No. 5542. A review by these authors of common decomposition methods used in economics was published in the Handbook of Labor Economics.Fortin, N., Lemieux, T., Firpo, S. (2011). Decomposition methods in economics. In: Ashenfelter, O., Card, D. (2011). Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 4A. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 1-102.

With the acquirement of personality comes privileges and responsibilities. Personality has been given to states, corporations, non- governmental organizations, international organizations, and individuals.  International law  Rules made by states for states is the basis of international law. International law governs states and their relationships with one another. Historically it was believed that states were the only actors in international law and therefore other entities were merely the responsibility of international law.  Basics  Gaining international legal personality is often a goal of international actors. By gaining personality, they gain acknowledgment in the international legal community. The amount of personality that an international actor has depends entirely upon state recognition. Legal personality can determine the rights that actors have as well as their standings with courts. As personality is given by states, it stands to reason that international actors are only effective when states allow them to be. Without the approval of states, other actors have no rights nor any true ability in the international arena. One question that critics of the effectiveness of legal personality ask is if ‚Äúpersonality contain[s] any inherent legal capacity to act?‚Äù Personality is a concept with many blurred areas but must be grasped to understand the effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, of international actors. Entities that are capable of being granted personality and thus being subjects of international law are those with the capacity to act within the international arena. Entities that are candidates for international legal personality include corporations, companies, sovereign states, international organizations, and individuals. These entities should have legal powers, the ability to effectively exercise their powers, and associations with states on a permanent basis.  History  Until the expansion of NGOs in the 20th century, legal personality was not given to non- state actors commonly, if ever. Once these entities became actors, they were not ordinarily given personality unless granted by the state in a legal statute or treaty. Typically international organizations, NGOs, and corporations were seen as groups of individuals and were viewed as recipients of international law, rather than actors on the international stage. However NGOs especially have increasingly begun to play important roles in international politics and policymaking over the last several decades. It is not clear when NGOs truly began to play a role in international politics, but the first notice of groups influencing the international policy-making occurred in 1826. In 1911, these groups began to grow and amass attention and in 1919 Dwight W. Morrow began using ‚ÄúNGO‚Äù as a term. By 1943 scholars of several disciplines were referring to these groups of influence as NGOs. After formal recognition by the UN, NGOs were able to truly interact in the international arena. Getting international personality has historically been an obstacle for NGOs. 1910 saw the first convention to grant legal personality, and in 1936 Charles Fenwick is quoted with saying that NGO representation ‚Äúmight be greatly effective in cutting across national lines.‚Äù In response to changes in world policies, the approaches taken to obtain and grant international legal personality have seen several changes. These changes have resulted in and will continue to result in variations and challenges to the sources of international legal personality and the roles that other international actors play. States were the first to gain international legal personality, followed by non-state actors (such as MNCs and NGOs) and individuals. The 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations established the definition of an international organization. The definition excluded non-governmental organizations and established the concept of legal personality.  Personality: privileges and rights  Rights that come with obtaining international legal personality include the right to enter into treaties, right to immunity, right to send and receive legations, and the right to bring international claims to obtain reparation for damages. Those who have international legal personality can sue and be sued, can enter into contracts, can incur debt, and pay various taxes. NGOs with personality are able to participate directly with international bodies and organizations created by legislation and treaties. They are given the ability to fund a cause rather than ask for funding for a cause. They are even given certain legal rights and protections. NGOs that are parties of a treaty can file for wrongdoings. NGOs with personality can eventually gain representative status on international councils and assemblies. Some NGOs, such as Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have been given rights that governments usually give to IOs. NGOs are not held back by things such as political parties and reelections, they are simply allowed to lobby for what they think is the best choice. This freedom is typically found only in NGOs. This freedom gives NGOs a type of flexibility and efficiency that, once again, other international actors don‚Äôt process. More energy is bound to arise from an NGO rather than an IGO, as NGOs are voluntary commitments. The people within an NGO are dedicated to their cause and are more likely to work harder to get things done. NGOs are also able to act beyond the realm of sovereignty in a way that governments and their organizations cannot do. Once an NGO reaches consultative status, they are able to do even more. Consultative NGOs are able to receive official documents, attend meetings of various councils, be consulted by a Secretary-General or committee, and participate in hearings in various ways.  Obtaining international legal personality  There are theories to consider when deciding how international legal personality should be applied and from where the power comes.  Legal Traditionalist approach  The Legal Traditionalist Approach is one such method. In this way of thinking, one would believe that international legal personality must be explicitly transmitted from states to actors via some legal instrument. Without this transfer, an actor has no standing. In this approach, states are viewed as the ultimate international actors and the only source for personality.  Factual Realist approach  Directly opposite of this approach is the Factual Realist Approach. This method of thinking outlines global integration as the source of international legal personality rather than states. Factual realists would assume that states will eventually cease to be the source of personality for NGOs as globalization and transculturation occur.  Dynamic State approach  The Dynamic State Approach falls rather nicely between the two latter approaches. Basically a halfway point between Factual Realism and Legal Traditionalism, this approach finds the source of personality for actors lies within international treaties or customs. Dynamic State Approach theorists would claim that while legal traditionalists lean too much towards preserving international law through tradition, factual realists tend to disregard the customs and traditions of international law.  Historical approach: United Nations Nationals  The Paris Peace Treaties, 1947 - Article 78 provides the basis and application of International Legal Personalities within Customary international law to each and every human being on (and off) Earth: :Article 78 :\\"United Nations nationals\\" means individuals who are nationals of any of the United Nations, or corporations or associations organized under the laws of any of the United Nations, at the coming into force of the present Treaty, provided that the said individuals, corporations or associations also had this status on September 3, 1943, the date of the Armistice with Italy. :The term \\"United Nations nationals\\" also includes all individuals, corporations or associations which, under the laws in force in Italy during the war, have been treated as an enemy; The application of International Legal Personalities upon all human beings is real and actionable as UN Nationals since 1947. In effect, the UN is the single global issuer of legal personalities for all Member-States. As the UN is the source, transfer of personalities between states becomes trivial. Moving a UN National called a Mexican into the United States is technically immaterial; as US Citizens are also UN Nationals equally. A US Citizen legal presence/instrument is merely a specialized UN National international legal personality. To a UN National, the border between countries is a trivial separation between UN economic zones. The UN globalized all Member-States' personalities under one organization, a global government of governments. With all UN Member-States receiving their personalities from the UN, legally, there is only one single global government with one single global citizenship as the United Nations. The full set of privileges (legally framed as \\"rights\\") for UN National International Legal Personalities is the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is important because, for instance, various countries Constitutions do not apply to UN Nationals except through the UN UDHR even within what people believe to be their own home country. CERN's Code of Conduct is copyright by the International Monetary Fund (under the United Nations) and the CERN vehicle license plates (\\"CD\\") are issued under the Corps Diplomatique; This indicates that CERN also uses UN National International Legal Personalities for international recognition as well.  United Kingdom v. Costa Rica (1923)   Facts  The former government of Costa Rica, known as the Ticono Regime, was said to have given oil concession to a British company. The new government of Costa Rica needed to acknowledge the action. The United Kingdom disagreed, as it had already been granted.  Questions  *\\"Does a government need to conform to a previous constitution if the government had established itself and maintained a peaceful de facto administration?\\" *\\"Does non-recognition of a government by other governments destroy the de facto status of the government?\\"  Ruling  There is no need to conform to a previous constitution in such an instance. Non- recognition of the government by other governments delegitimizes the status of the government.

The Dragons play in the Western Region of the United States Australian Football League. In addition to being a regular annual participant at USAFL Nationals, the Dragons also compete in the Western Regionals tournament, as well as the SoCal Cup, a round-robin series of matches against the San Diego Lions and the Orange County Bombers. In 2014, the Dragons won the Division II USAFL National Championship in Columbus, Ohio, after making the Division II Grand Final in both 2012 and 2013 as well. In the past two seasons, the Dragons have consistently been ranked in the top 10 nationally. The club has attracted players from across the globe ‚Äì from Aussies just briefly passing through town to Americans who have never kicked a football before. At 2016 USAFL Nationals (held in Sarasota, Florida), the Dragons defeated the Quebec Saints (4.9.33 to 2.2.14) and lost to the Denver Bulldogs (8.2.50 to 4.2.26) before getting eliminated by the eventual champions, the Austin Crows, the following day (7.5.47 to 0.5.5). In 2017, the Dragons completed their best Division 1 season yet, defeating the reigning premiers ‚Äì the Austin Crows ‚Äì at that year's Nationals in San Diego. However, they later lost in a Grand Final heartbreaker to the Golden Gate Roos. Three members of the Dragons ‚Äì Bill McGovern, Donald Lee, and Gabriel Martin del Campo ‚Äì were selected to the US Revolution squad for the 2017 Australian Football International Cup. Lee competed in the final squad for the Cup, while McGovern and Martin del Campo were part of the Revolution's 2018 summer tour of Ireland. Notable American Dragons players who have played at the local level in Australia include Sam Murphy, David Dollar, Gabriel Martin del Campo and Cam Freeman.

Description Melaleuca spectabilis is a spreading or prostrate shrub growing to about tall with branches and leaves that are glabrous when mature. Its leaves are arranged alternately, long and wide, heart-shaped with a sharp point on the end and with at least the lower part of the leaf pressed against the stem. The flowers are yellow to lime-green and arranged in heads on the sides of the branches. Each head contains 5 to 15 individual flowers and is up to in diameter. The petals are long (compared to in M. longistaminea) and fall off as the flowers mature. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and there are 9 to 24 stamens per bundle.

Retrieved 22 April 2015. Fem magazine was one of the longest continually active magazines focusing on feminist issues that was published in Latin America. In 2005, its director, Esperanza Brito de Mart√≠, reported that the print version was being discontinued due to high costs and from then on, the magazine would only be published online. The magazine focuses on social and political issues, art and cinema. It contains news, poetry and short stories. Topics range from domestic violence to health care, women in the student movement, AIDS, prostitution, and Chicanas. The headquarters is in Mexico City. The aspiration of the magazine was to bring a broad feminist perspective to Latin America, in hopes of inspiring grassroots feminist movements and achieving a recognition of the feminist ideologies within political and cultural spheres. Initially the feminist perspectives of Fem were viewed as the domain of an educated elite that struggled to gain acceptance amongst the population. Much early success was sustained, however, through ties to publications such as Unom√°suno.Mariscal, Sonia. (2014). ‚ÄúI am not a feminist!!!‚Äù Feminism and its Natural Allies, Mexican Feminism in the 70s/80s. Thinking Gender 2014. UCLA: UCLA Center for the Study of Women. Retrieved from: http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7c7114jz During interviews conducted by Fem, few women who held positions in the public eye, were willing to acknowledge or identify their perspectives as feminist (i.e. first female governor of Mexico, Griselda Alvarez). This sentiment, echoed by various Fem employees, found voice even in co-founder Elena Poniatowska. Poniatowska chose not to identify as feminist, regardless of her works and efforts with working- class women which clearly embodied a feminist perspective. Fem was instrumental in establishing that sexuality was not simply a personal characteristic but also a political narrative that marked the oppression experienced by women throughout the world. Fem sought to address this issue within the scope of Latin American society. By asserting that women's biological differences from men were not challenges to be addressed individually, Fem illuminated the importance and political nature of maternity, abortion, sexuality, contraception, lesbianism and rape in interviews with individuals such as Marta Lamas whom were significant in the social recognition of women's imperatives within the male dominant hierarchy within Latin America. Despite progressing the conversation surrounding women's rights, Fem was intentionally tentative in how it approached women's agency particularly relative to LGBT social movements within the U.S. which sometimes removed men as imperatives to the lives of women. This provisional strategy was employed to avoid alienation from the slower political and cultural developments relative to gender within Latin America. Fem also published works on violence against women and sexual violence though these efforts were also approached more slowly and cautiously than other tenets of feminisms for fear of dangerous backlash against the staff of the paper and women aligned with the feminist community.Macdonald, R.

History and governance Advance America was founded in 1980 by Eric Miller, an attorney from Indianapolis, with the help of ten other people. It shares space and employees with Miller's law office. It is governed by a seven member board of directors consisting entirely of pastors. Activities Advance America publishes an annual voter's guide informing voters of the stance of various candidates for local office on issues Advance America is concerned about. These voter guides are distributed primarily through mail, e-mail, and churches. Advance America attempts to keep people informed about what bills and issues the state legislature is considering through mailings, e-mails, voting record summaries, pastor and citizen briefings, and speaking engagements (frequently in churches). Advance America claims that their staff reviews each bill to come before the state legislature. They testify before legislative committees, talk to legislators, draft amendments and bills, and mobilize the public to contact legislators. Issues Advance America regularly campaigns for issues that they perceive affect the family and religious freedom. They supported the controversial Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act as well as pushing to uphold the state's same sex marriage ban. They have opposed legislation permitting transgender persons to use the bathroom of their choice. They have opposed extending regulations on daycares to include those daycares run by churches. They support legislation mandating public schools to display a poster in each classroom prominently displaying the United States national motto \\"In God We Trust\\". In 2019, on the one year anniversary of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Indiana passed a bill providing mental health funding to schools. Advance America pushed for an amendment requiring parental consent before children could seek mental health treatment under the bill, such language was included in the final bill.

Argentina and Brazil both have broadcast call signs systems. Some stations still broadcast their call signs a few times a day, but this practice is becoming very rare. Call signs were first assigned to South American countries in 1913, and the call sign blocks were expanded to include amateur radio in 1947. In 1995, Brazil, Argentina Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela signed up to the International Amateur Radio Permit agreement requiring governments to mutually recognize amateur radio licenses issued to citizens of other participating countries. Canada and the United States are also party to the agreement. Argentina Argentinian broadcast call signs consist of two (or, more recently, three) letters followed by multiple numbers. The second letter, as used in television call signs from the 1960s, traditionally indicated the region; LS call signs were given to stations in Buenos Aires, LT in the northeastern region, LU in the southern region, LV in the central region and LW in the northwestern region. (LR was used for some radio stations, especially in Buenos Aires; the earliest radio stations in the Argentine capital had call signs of LR plus one digit.) Most TV stations had call signs with higher two-digit numbers. The five main stations in the Buenos Aires area had call signs from LS 82 to LS 86, while stations in Rosario, Santa Fe had call signs LT 83 and LT 85. Amateur radio call signs are used to uniquely identify 37,000 licensed amateur operators in Argentina. Call signs are regulated internationally by the ITU as well as nationally by the Comisi√≥n Nacional de Comunicaciones of the Argentine government. Foreign amateurs can obtain permission to operate in the country from can contact the Radio Club Argentino.

Burke, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court first elaborated on the exhaustion doctrine. According to that doctrine, a so-called authorized sale of a patented product (one made by the patentee or a person authorized by it to sell the product) liberates the product from the patent monopoly. The product becomes the complete property of the purchaser and \\"passes without the monopoly.\\" The property owner is then free to use or dispose of it as it may choose, free of any control by the patentee. Adams is a widely cited, leading case. A substantially identical doctrine applies in copyright law and is known as the \\"first sale doctrine\\". As the Supreme Court recently explained, in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 1351 (2013), the principle comes from early English common law of property, explained in Coke on Littleton early in the 17th Century. Under the common law, if a man is possessed of a chattel (item of personal property) and he transfers his property in it to another, no restriction against the use or disposition of the chattel will be effective, for that would hinder trade and commerce ‚Äì it would interfere with bargaining among men. If once a patented product was sold and allowed to enter the stream of commerce, if it could be subject to restrictions (perhaps secret) on its use or further disposition, businessmen would not be able to know whether transactions in the product were effective and business certainty would be greatly impaired. Factual background In 1863, U.S. Patent No. 38,713 issued to the inventors Merrill and Horner for a coffin lid that permitted interested persons to view the name-plate and inscription of the decedent in the coffin, irrespective of whether the coffin cover is open or closed. In 1865 they assigned to Lockhart & Seelye of Cambridge. Massachusetts, the ownership of the patent in a circular area around Boston having a ten-mile radius. Adams, the plaintiff in this case, was the assignee of the patent in an area outside this circle which included the town of Natick, Massachusetts.Adams v. Burks, 1 Fed. Cas. 100 (Case No. 50) (C.C.D. Mass. 1871). Burke, the defendant, was an undertaker doing business in Natick, Massachusetts, seventeen miles from Boston. Burke purchased some patented coffin lids from Lockhart & Seelye, who had manufactured them. Burke then took them to Natick (more than ten miles from Boston), and used them in his business. Adams then sued him.1 Fed. Cas. at 100. Trial court opinion The circuit court for the district of Massachusetts dismissed the case. It said: Supreme Court opinion Adams appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed. The Court began by observing that this was a case of first impression in the Supreme Court although the governing principle had been involved in other patent cases.\\"The question presented by the plea in this case is a very interesting one in patent law, and the precise point in it has never been decided by this Court, though cases involving some of the considerations which apply to it have been decided and others of analogous character are frequently recurring.\\" Adams, 84 U.S. at 455. That principle was this: Accordingly, the Court ruled that \\"we hold that in the class of machines or implements we have described, when they are once lawfully made and sold, there is no restriction on their use to be implied for the benefit of the patentee or his assignees or licensees.\\"Adams, 84 U.S. at 457. Subsequent Supreme Court cases following the doctrine of the Adams case include: * Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502 (1917). * Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., 243 U.S. 490 (1917). * Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, 309 U.S. 436 (1940). * United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U.S. 241 (1942). * Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U. S. 336 (1961). * Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U.S. 617 (2008). But see: * United States v. General Electric Co., 272 U.S. 476 (1926).In this case, the Court ruled that the Adams patent exhaustion doctrine applied to sales, but not to agency agreements or licenses to manufacture. * General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co., 304 U.S. 175 (1938).In this case, the Court ruled that the Adams patent exhaustion doctrine did not apply to a sale made by a licensee to manufacture a patented product only for use or sale in a defined field, where the licensee's customer had notice of the license limitation or restriction.

It was founded by the Vocational Training Council in 2007 and moved into a purpose-built campus in 2010. The school offers higher diplomas, academic degrees, and continuing education programmes in various design disciplines.  History  The Hong Kong Design Institute was envisioned to centralise existing design programmes offered at various other Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education campuses in Tiu Keng Leng, Sha Tin, Kwai Chung, Kwun Tong, and Tsing Yi. In April 2006, the VTC opened an international architecture competition to design a new campus able to accommodate 4,000 students. The competition was judged by a panel of noted architects including Richard Meier and Rocco Yim. The winning design, which beat out 162 other submissions, was produced by the French architecture firm Coldefy & Associ√©s.  Administration  Academic oversight of the Hong Kong Design Institute is provided by the Academic Director (Design Discipline) of the Vocational Training Council who is concurrently the campus Principal. The Hong Kong Design Institute and Institute of Vocational Education (Lee Wai Lee) combined campus at Tiu Keng Leng is managed by the campus Principal, Vice- Principals and Institute Secretary. The Design programmes are offered mainly at the Tiu Keung Leng site with some programmes located at the IVE (Kwun Tong) campus.

HackerRank's programming challenges can be solved in a variety of programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, JavaScript) and span multiple computer science domains. On the consumer side, when a programmer submits a solution to a programming challenge, their submission is scored on the accuracy of their output. Programmers are then ranked globally on the HackerRank leaderboard and earn badges based on their accomplishments to drive competition among users. In addition to individual coding challenges, HackerRank also hosts contests (often referred to by HackerRank as \\"CodeSprints\\") where users compete on the same programming challenges during a set period of time and are then ranked at the conclusion of the event. HackerRank is part of the growing gamification trend within competitive computer programming and the consumer-side of their website is free for coders to use.  History  HackerRank was founded as InterviewStreet Inc. by two NIT Trichy alumni Vivek Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi. HackerRank is a Y Combinator-backed company, and was the first Indian company accepted into Y Combinator. They also participated in TechCrunch Disrupt in 2012, and currently have venture capital backing from Khosla Ventures and Battery Ventures.

History Toonerville has its start as a roadside gas station whose owner included the image of a popular comic in his sign. The community was named after Toonerville Folks, a comic strip. In the 1930s, Weldon Spring was isolated from the greater St. Louis area due to the Missouri River. Three towns: Hamburg, Howell, and Toonerville, were connections to the outside world as the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railroads had stops in Hamburg. Southern St. Charles county gained direct access to the St. Louis area because of the completion of the Daniel Boone Bridge in 1937. Locals had intended this project to increase opportunities for the county, however it gave the U.S. Army an area in rural Missouri, to develop weapons for the anticipated WWII. Before the attacks on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Army wanted to utilize an isolated spot to develop explosive weapons such as TNT and DNT explosives. In October 1940, the local newspapers had announced that the U.S. Army was going to take 17,000 acres of land through eminent domain and that the townspeople who inhabited these areas had three months to vacate their homes. Houses, churches, and school buildings were immediately demolished and the town ceased to exist within three months of the order. The Weldon Springs Ordnance Works, operated by Atlas Power Company, began production in 1941 employing more than 5,000 people and maintained more than 1,000 buildings. It ceased production on August 15, 1945, when the Japanese Surrendered. By that time, the plant had produced more than 700 million tons of TNT. After selling land to various conservation departments, the United States Atomic Energy Commission retained 2,000 acres to build a uranium ore processing plant in 1955. The Weldon Spring Uranium Feed Mill Plant, operated Mallinkrodt Chemical Works of St. Louis produced raw uranium ore into \\"yellow cake\\", or concentrated ore that is then shipped to other countries. In 1966, the uranium plant ceased operation. During the Vietnam War, the Army planned to use the land to produce Agent Orange, but this plan was never carried out. The land sat empty for twenty years with contaminated equipment and hazardous chemicals. The U.S. Department of Energy took over the site in the 1980s and began studying various ways to clean up hazardous and radioactive waste. This started a long and controversial project led by the Department of Energy, state and county governments and thousands of residents, in 1992, to remove contaminated materials from Weldon Spring site to a designated 45-acre area designed to safely contain the hazardous waste for over a thousand years. The official name of this site is the Weldon Spring Site Remedial Action Project (WSSRAP).  Conservation Areas  The army started to sell pieces of land after the war. The Missouri Department of Conservation bought 7,000 acres with a donation from August Busch. The University of Missouri bought another 7,000 which was later sold to the Conservation Department. Today, this property is part of the Busch Memorial Conservation Area and the Weldon Spring Conservation Area.  Tourist Attractions  After the various efforts to clean up hazardous materials, the land is now used for fishing, hiking, hunting, and bicycling. Stairs leading up the massive waste containing structure to the highest peak in St. Charles.  The Weldon Spring Site Remedial Action Project (WSSRAP)  In 2001, the completion on the gargantuan structure covers roughly 45 acres and stores 1.5 million cubic yards of hazardous waste material. Visitors can take the stairs that lead to its peak, where there is a viewing platform and plaques that provide information on the local area, its history, and the construction of the waste preserving site. Visitors can also see the 9,000-square-foot interpretive center housed in a building at the base of the cell that was once used to check workers for radioactivity. The peak of the Weldon Spring waste cell is the highest point in St. Charles County.  Weldon Spring's Lewis and Clark Trails  There are two distinctive trails within the Weldon Spring Conservation area south of route 94 and north of the Missouri river. Both trails sync up at a scenic view of the Missouri River. = The Lewis Trail = The longer of the two, at 7.9 miles, covers the length from 94 towards the Missouri River and also extends closer to the Missouri Bluffs Golf Club in a loop that heads back north towards 94. = The Clark Trail = The Clark trail is roughly 5.3 miles long and begins with the same trail as Lewis for two and a half miles until the trails split near the Missouri River.

Transcript In humans, C7orf31 codes for an mRNA strand that is 3609 base pairs long. The human mRNA is composed of a 5' untranslated region that is 561 bases and a 3' untranslated region that is 1275 bases long. Protein The primary protein encoded by C7orf31 in humans is 590 amino acids long with molecular weight 38334 Da. The protein is part of a functionally uncharacterized family of proteins (pfam15093) with a domain of unknown function (DUF4555). Protein Orthology The C7orf31 protein is well- conserved in mammals and birds, but is less conserved in more distant organisms. C7orf31 does not have any paralogs in humans. Expression In humans, C7orf31 is predicted to be localized in the cytosol, nucleus, mitochondrion, and peroxisome, and it is expressed in almost all tissues. It is highly expressed especially in the testes. Interaction Two-hybrid studies have found interactions between the proteins encoded by A8K5H9 and C7orf31, and another study has found the protein to interact with KBTBD5. A study in 2014 found C7orf31 to be a candidate as a centrosome-associated protein, using mass spectrometry on mammalian sperm cells‚Äô centrioles. The protein appears in the study alongside seven other centrosome-associated protein candidates. Along with 2241 other proteins, C7orf31 also exhibited significant binding in a microarray experiment to Œ≤-amyloids, a group of proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, in a protein-protein interaction network study, C7orf31 was found to associate with KLHL40, whose exact function is also not known.

World War II  On 10 July 1945 it comprised 231st and 300th Rifle Divisions as part of 1st Red Banner Army, Maritime Group of Forces.Feskov et al 2013, about pg 49. Service in the invasion of Manchuria On the dawn of 8 August 1945 the artillery preparation of the invasion of Manchuria began when the USSR declared war on Japan. On 9 August 1945 the corps received an order to commence operations, and to cross the international border in the region of Grodekovo settlement. The corps advanced through steep mountain slopes, impassable roads, under strong downpours, and over swampy areas. In the course of the Manchurian offensive operation the 87th Rifle Corps moved in into the reserve of the 35th Army formations along the northern shore of Lake Khanka. The 342nd Rifle Division was committed to battle once at the approaches to the Mishan (Japanese) Fortified Region. The 357th Rifle Regiment (from 342nd Rifle Division) reached Khobiy city in North Manchuria while constantly engaged in combat. The 35th Army, from the staging area Guberovo, Ruzhino, Lesozavodsk, delivered the supporting attack of the 1st Far-Eastern Front (commander - Marshal of the Soviet Union K.A. Meretskov) in the direction of Lesozavodsk, Khutou, Mishan with the task of destroying the Mishan group of Japanese troops. After assaulting across the Sungach river, the 342nd RD with 357th Rifle Regiment directed its concentrated efforts toward securing the area of Tsikhulin region, Khubey, and Yangan (50 kilometers west of Khulin). The stability of defence of the entire Japanese Mishansk Group depended on the retention of this region. As a result of persistent and bloody combat the 357th RR took the railway station and the city of Khubey. For the next three days the division advanced as part of the corps second echelon into the depths of enemy held territory. In the middle of August 1945 the 87th Rifle Corps returned to the area of Lesozavodsk ‚Äì Sibirtsevo, where it entrained and was transported to Vladivostok. During this time (on 11 to 12 August 1945) the 87th Rifle Corps was brought out from the reserve of the 1st Far-Eastern Front, and received new orders to prepare for landing operations on the island of Hokkaido (Japan). At the end of August 1945, the 87th RC moved from Harbin in its entirety (264th, 342nd, 355th RD) and began redeployment to Sakhalin for the purpose of concentrating the troops for the planned landing operation on the island of Hokkaido. This landing operation did not take place, but the corps still completed its concentration at Sakhalin. The Japanese opposing force on Sakhalin and the Kuriles was the Japanese Fifth Area Army. At 0830 on 22 August 1945 the 355th RD of the 87th RC was taken out of the 1st Far- Eastern Front reserve and transported by the convoy VKMA-1 from Vladivostok to the port of Maoka (now Kholmsk of South-Sakhalin region), arriving at 1600 on 25 August 1945. On 23 August 1945 the Supreme Commander-in-Chief I.V. Stalin declared his appreciation for 357th RR of the 342nd RD for conspicuous courage and heroism. On 28 August 1945 the 355th RD began its advance into the region of the port of Otomari, and then force marched on 1 September 1945 to in the Otomari region. On 1400 on 23 August 1945 a new convoy VKMA-2 departed from Vladivostok to the port of Maoka, which transported the 342nd Rifle Division and 215th Artillery Brigade of the 87th Rifle Corps, arriving at 1425 on 26 August 1945 at the port. Although the 342nd was in the process of being transported to Sakhalin on 25 August, on 22 August Stalin had already ordered Vasilevsky to halt the planned landing preparations on Hokkaido until further notice. However he allowed the transfer of the 87th Rifle Corps to continue to Sakhalin. By 27 August 1945 the landing operation on was Hokkaido postponed, and then completely abandoned. At 0920 on 25 August 1945 the convoy VKMA-3 departed Vladivostok with the 264th Rifle Division and staff of the 87th Rifle Corps. Because of a breakdown in the screw propeller in the transport ‚ÄúLeo Tolstoy‚Äù the convoy had to berth at the Vladimir Bay, where it stood until 28 August 1945, eventually reaching Maoka at 1330 on 30 August 1945. At 0000 on 30 August 1945 the 87th RC was transferred to the 2nd Far East Front by order of Marshal of the Soviet Union A.M. Vasilevsky. The corps became a part of the 16th Army. Unloading the last regiment of the 264th RD on Sakhalin was completed at 1900 on 1 September 1945. On 2 September 1945 the transportation of the 87th Rifle Corps to Sakhalin island was completed. Postwar The corps moved its headquarters from Aniva to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on 2 October 1945. On 1 November it was directly subordinated to the Far Eastern Military District, with the Kuriles-based 355th Division and the 2nd and 113th Separate Rifle Brigades being simultaneously transferred to the 85th Rifle Corps. The corps was left with the 264th and 342nd Rifle Divisions on Sakhalin. In May 1953, the corps headquarters was relocated to the mainland, leaving its troops behind on Sakhalin. It became part of the 25th Army with headquarters at Chuguyevka, including the 63rd Rifle and 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division from 7 August. The corps was renumbered as the 32nd Rifle Corps in 1955 and disbanded in mid-1956.

In 1966 he was a Guggenheim Fellow.John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Education and career Murphey earned his A.B. degree magna cum laude in history in 1941 and his M.A. degree in history from Harvard University in 1942. Although not a Quaker, Murphey attended a Friends School in his hometown of Philadelphia. That environment shaped his belief that ‚Äúkilling wouldn't solve anything.‚Äù He resolved, however, to assist against the threat of the Axis powers. He enlisted as a conscientious objector and served with the British Friends Ambulance Unit in China from 1942 to 1946. In the ambulance unit, Murphey and an international group of men drove old, charcoal- powered Chevrolet trucks throughout southwest China with medical supplies. Following the war, Murphey received an M.A. degree in international and regional studies in 1948 and his Ph.D. degree in Far Eastern history and geography from Harvard University in 1950, where he studied with John K.

Memories of wartime China As a driver for the British Ambulance Corps in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Murphey traveled to Kunming, Chungking, Yen‚Äôan, Hanoi, Hong Kong and Shanghai and met Chiang Kai-Shek and Mao Zedong. Hong Kong was just an ‚Äúoutpost of colonialism,‚Äù Murphey recalled, and nothing like the huge metropolis that it became in post-war history. Murphy told a later interviewer his wartime encounters with Zhou Enlai, who was a ‚Äúcharmer‚Äù : :He was a delightful guy... Well, there was no real language barrier because his French was excellent and most of us knew French...and we were quite at home with Chinese so we would talk both languages with him...and he used to have \\"open house\\" in Chungking...he lived in Chungking for much of the war because he was the go-between...he was a diplomat... :He had a fourth floor walk up \\"cold water\\" flat...in the back of one of those buildings in Chungking...and we used to go up there for tea and peanuts, and whatnot, on Thursday afternoons...when he was in town. He was great...just great. I know why we used to go! ...not just because he was great, but because we had already been planning to send medical supplies up to them, which we knew they desperately needed... But, we had been prevented from doing so by the stupid Kuomintang, and so, we finally \\"sicked\\" the Americans, the American Embassy, on them...

Murphy recalled that he came away with a positive impression, but added: :Oh, totally! ...totally...and in those days we, like everybody else, I guess I could say that we were naive, but then so was everybody else, ah, in, ah, taking the Communists at face value...on the basis of what they had done up to that point...which was pretty good, pretty positive.

Fiji's rates of violence against women are \\"among the very highest in the world\\". The Fiji Women's Crisis Centre reports that 64% of women who have been in intimate relationships have experienced physical or sexual violence from their partner, including 61% who were physically attacked and 34% who were sexually abused. The 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat created conditions which exacerbated the presence of violence against women in Fijian society, especially in the public sector. Conventional attitudes about the place of women in Fijian society perpetuate the normalisation of violence against women and permeate extended family groups, the local authorities and the judiciary. Customary and religious practices like bulubulu (forgiveness ceremonies) deal with domestic violence cases within the family, usually either precluding prosecution for the perpetrator or reducing their sentence. Fiji's recent political background 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat In December 2006 Commodore Bainimarama seized control of the Fijian government, deposed the Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and named Jona Senilagakali as Prime Minister. Subsequently, the Fijian media was heavily censored. On December 7 Bainimarama sacked the Acting Commissioner of Police, Moses Driver, and installed Army Colonel Jim Kori, securing military control of the police force. The 2006 military coup in Fiji created an unstable political environment and heralded a range of human rights violations, including instances of violence against women. The Emergency Regulations put in place following the coup resulted in impunity for police and authorities who were involved in, or failed to prevent, instances of violence against women. Steps toward restoring the rule of law in Fiji were made when a Constitution was adopted in 2013. In 2014 a General Election was held and Frank Bainimarama was elected as Prime Minister. International legal obligations Fiji is a party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Although there is no specific provision in the convention on violence against women, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women stated in their General Recommendation No. 19 that Violence against Women is ‚Äúa form of discrimination that seriously inhibits women‚Äôs ability to enjoy rights and freedoms on a basis of equality with men‚Äù, which fell within the definition of ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù in Article 1 of the convention. The committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women have affirmed that states who are party to the convention are required to act to protect women against violence of any kind. The Committee specifically addressed the issue of violence against women in Fiji in their 2010 Concluding Observations. Violence against Women The committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee) reported that the level of violence against women in Fiji was ‚Äúpersistently high in both the private and public spheres‚Äù. The reported violence took place as physical or sexual abuse in a domestic context, along with several other forms. Violence against women's rights activists Amnesty International reported violence in the forms of threats, assaults and torture perpetrated against female women's rights activists by military officers during the military takeover in December 2006. Violence against sex workers Amnesty International also reported that in 2009 the Police Commissioner took part in ‚ÄúChristian crusades‚Äù to combat crime in Fijian urban centres. These ‚Äúcrusades‚Äù involved the arrest, assault and rape of sex workers. The criminalisation of sex work in Fiji made these sex workers particularly vulnerable to violence perpetrated by the police. The CEDAW Committee observed that the Public Emergency Regulation promulgated at the time of the abrogation of Fiji's Constitution in 2009 granted immunity to police and military officers and allowed them to carry out the aforementioned instances of violence against women with impunity. Causes =Gender stereotypes= Strong patriarchal attitudes and conventional beliefs about the roles and responsibilities of women are culturally prevalent in Fiji and contribute to the normalisation of violence against women. The Fijian authorities are often reluctant to arrest and charge men for physically abusing their female partners unless there is pressure from the victim's family or from women's rights activists providing advocacy services to the victim. This reluctance to prosecute stems from the widely accepted belief that men are allowed to beat their wives and partners if they have \\"good cause\\". Conventional attitudes in Fiji do not consider domestic violence a criminal offence but rather a family matter to be resolved by those involved. 2015 Local women's rights activist groups Efforts to challenge the norm of violence against women in Fiji are made by a number of activist groups. The Fiji Women's Crisis Centre (FWCC) provides counselling, legal and medical support services to female victims of domestic violence and are involved in public advocacy and community education on violence against women. The FWCC also compiles and presents data on domestic violence in Fiji. The Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT) is the Human Rights Programme of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). The RRRT operate in Fiji and focus on gender violence as a specific issue. RRRT operates by providing \\"training, policy advice and technical support to Pacific governments and civil society\\". Legislation addressing violence against women Domestic Violence Decree 2009 The Domestic Violence Decree was passed in 2009 and commenced in September 2010. Among the objects of the Decree are: \\"to eliminate, reduce and prevent domestic violence\\", \\"to ensure the protection, safety and wellbeing of victims of domestic violence\\" and to meet Fiji's international obligations under CEDAW. The decree provides for restraining orders to be applied for by adult victims of domestic violence. Formerly protection orders could only be obtained for children under the Family Protection Act 2003. Restraining orders under the Domestic Violence Decree can be applied for whether or not the perpetrator is charged with a criminal offence. The Domestic Violence Decree also imposes duties upon police to prevent domestic violence, detect instances of domestic violence and to apprehend perpetrators. Police are under the duty to respond to and investigate reports of domestic violence and to provide assistance to the victim. Police are also under the duty to apply for a restraining order for the protection of a victim of domestic violence if a person is charged with committing a domestic violence offence or where the police officer suspects or believes that someone is at risk of domestic violence. Obstacles to implementation of Violence against Women legislation The reluctance of police to charge perpetrators of violence against women has been discussed above. There are further obstacles to the successful implementation of the Domestic Violence Decree. Customary and religious practices (bulubulu) Customary \\"reconciliation\\" or \\"forgiveness\\" ceremonies are widely used to deal with cases of domestic violence internally. The ceremony usually consists of the perpetrator's family asking forgiveness from the victim's family through presentation of gifts. These ceremonies take place without the victim's consent or participation and disempower the victim from deciding whether or not to report the violence. Furthermore, the ceremonies, which are intended to help keep the family unit together preclude the victim from leaving the abusive relationship./ Amnesty International reported that in 2009 the Fijian police force joined the New Methodist Church in undertaking Christian \\"crusades\\" and compelled victims of domestic violence to reconcile with their husbands. This was portrayed as \\"the implementation of Christian principles of maintaining the family unit\\". It was also reported that in many cases where reconciliation was compelled by the authorities the abuse re-occurred. In cases where a person is charged with a domestic violence offence, Fiji's Criminal Procedure Decree requires the courts to \\"promote reconciliation and encourage and facilitate the settlement in an amicable way of the proceedings\\". This means that the court is to encourage parties in cases of domestic violence to substitute proceedings with reconciliation ceremonies. The courts also take reconciliation ceremonies into account when sentencing the offender, resulting in a lesser sentence. In effect, the courts' recognition of reconciliation and forgiveness ceremonies enable perpetrators of domestic violence to escape the full force of the law and deny victims acknowledgement of the gravity of the offence. Gender and Human Rights Adviser Imrana Jalal observes that the recognition of these ceremonies prioritises social cohesion and harmony over the rights of the victim. Judicial processes Cases of domestic violence are often prosecuted under common assault, resulting in lenient sentences for the offenders such as six months or less. The aforementioned gender stereotypes permeate the judiciary in Fiji. Amnesty International expressed concern over the lack of sufficient training for the judiciary in Fiji in addressing cases related to violence against women. An example is provided of a Magistrate telling a victim of domestic violence that she was \\"not living in a utopia and should not expect a perfect husband\\" and asked the victim \\"which woman has not been slapped by her husband?\\" However, in 2012 the Fiji Judiciary Criminal Law Workshop for Judges and Magistrates provided the judiciary with guidance in applying the Domestic Violence Decree. The workshop identified the limitations of customary reconciliation ceremonies and stressed the importance of promoting \\"an equal access to justice by women\\", especially in relation to violence against women.

It consists of rice noodles with stock and toppings, combining rice noodle which almost served with thin type of noodle called ‚Äúsen lek‚Äù. Sliced pork or sweet pork-based broth, ground pork and crackling are almost based on topping. Thin sliced green beans, small pieces of salted turnip, ground peanut are the main ingredients. The taste is based on sweet mellow and smell of lime, dressing with fish sauce and ground chili. Kuaytiaw sukhothai is popular served two types: dry or with soup.  History  Thailand has traded with the Chinese since the Sukhothai era by shipping the Celadon Sangkhalok Ware. According to the trading document, there was not a record about noodle until the Ayutthaya era. The reign of King Ramathibodi III (Narai), during 1656-1688) was the golden age of various foods. Due to the trading with many countries so not only exchanging goods, but also many types of food from other countries to Siam. Afterward, Thais adapted those foods to suit their local ingredients and their tastes. The noodle also came along with the Chinese merchants, they cooked and shared it to others as the new dish which made people wanted to try this single dish that was easily cooked just boiling noodle, adding meat, and pouring soup.

Early life Animesh Ray was born in a suburb of Calcutta (now Kolkata), which used to be a French colony in India, to parents both of whom had their ancestral homes in East Bengal (now Bangladesh). He studied in a Bengali medium high school, and then in Presidency College (now Presidency University). After his undergraduate studies, he went to Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, to obtain Masters of Science in the new School of Life Sciences. He obtained his Ph.D. in microbial genetics from Monash University. From 1984 to 1988 he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute of Molecular Biology at the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA, in the laboratory of Professor Franklin W. Stahl. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1989-1991, in the laboratory of Professor Ethan Signer. From 1991 to 1995 he was an assistant professor at University of Rochester and then was its associate professor from 1996 to 2001. He joined Keck Graduate Institute as a professor in 2001. From 2001 to 2004 he was also an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego and during the same years was a visiting professor at University of Rochester. In 2009 he became visiting professor at Institute for Systems Biology and University of Hyderabad and currently works as director of Ph.D. programs at Keck Graduate Institute as well as Center for Network Studies. Since 2009, he also has been an adjunct professor at the Center for Computational Sciences, San Diego State University, San Diego, and at the School of Mathematical Sciences at the Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California. Career Since 1985 Animesh Ray has studied mechanisms of DNA recombination. In 1989 Animesh Ray published on mechanisms of homologous recombination induced by a DNA double strand break using HIS3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and suggested that its chromosomes produce double chain break during DNA recombination. From 1995 to 2002, he conducted research on computing with DNA. In May 1997 he and Mitsunori Ogihara discovered DNA based computers can perform massively parallel computations. In June 1997 Animesh Ray suggested that gametophyte is responsible for pollen tube guidance but also mentioned that it might be indirectly accomplished. In 2002 he studied ovule of Arabidopsis thaliana and discovered a new type of gene regulation, involving post-transcriptional gene silencing, through a gene called DCL1 which is required for RNA silencing all multicellular organisms, including plants, in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis. In 2007 he and his students used Arabidopsis thaliana to track a footprint of broken DNA and suggested that the genes move from one locus to another. In 2011 he suggested that microRNA gene, miR-34b can be of use to diagnose melanoma. Awards Animesh Ray has had numerous awards from the National Science Foundation since 1993. In 2009 Animesh Ray and Ali Nadim were awarded with $100,000 grant from the National Science Foundation.

He earned a bachelor's and master's degree in agriculture from National Chung Hsing University and completed on the school's track team. Peng completed a Ph.D from the University of Illinois. He then returned to NCHU as a professor. Political career Peng took office as head of the Council of Agriculture on 15 May 1997. In February 1998, Taiwan reached an agreement to join the World Trade Organization, but had to make adjustments unpopular with hog farmers, namely opening the nation's market to foreign meats. Peng announced short term losses for the agricultural sector in Taiwan, but vowed to aid livestock farmers. He had backed a first draft of revisions to the Agricultural Development Law as proposed in 1999, but pulled his support after the Council of Agriculture made further changes. The Kuomintang legislative caucus proposed another set of amendments, and Peng resigned his position on 6 December 1999 in protest. Peng's resignation was approved the next day and Lin Hsiang-nung was promoted as Peng's successor. After the KMT version of the bill passed the Legislative Yuan in January 2000, Peng released a statement critical of the newly promulgated law. After the end of his tenure as head of the COA, Peng has written for the Taipei Times on the subject of agriculture. He is against the construction of housing on agricultural land, as well as the use of ractopamine in livestock. Academic career Peng's appointment as president of National Chung Hsing University drew controversy in September 2000, as he was accused of plagiarism and subsequently investigated. Despite opposition from faculty, he took office as the president of the institution in October 2000, only to be removed from office by the Ministry of Education in January 2001.

It was first published in book form in 1884 by Williams and Norgate, London and Edinburgh, from articles previously published in The Contemporary Review. The book consists of four main chapters: The New Toryism, The Coming Slavery, The Sins of Legislators and The Great Political Superstition. In this book, English libertarian sociologist Herbert Spencer sees a statist corruption appearing within the liberal ideological framework, and warns of what he calls \\"the coming slavery\\". He argues that liberalism, which liberated the world from slavery and feudalism, was undergoing a transformation. Its new love for the state would put liberalism behind a movement to create a new despotism that would be worse than the old. Henry Hazlitt commented that this was \\"One of the most powerful and influential arguments for limited government, laissez faire and individualism ever written.\\"https://mises.org/library/man-versus- state The New Toryism In the first chapter of the book, Herbert Spencer starts by saying that those of which who now pass as Liberals, actually act as Tories of a new type, and proceeds by arguing that the so-called liberals, who once fought for liberalization, liberties and limiting the power of the nobility, have now obtained interest in increasing the power of the parliament and the government instead of protecting the rights of the people; the liberals have changed their ways completely and adopted measures of increasing their importance in the lives of men just as the Tories did, by keeping power into their own hands. In his own words: Spencer argues that these new \\"Liberals\\" simply exchange the power of kings for that of parliament. The Coming Slavery In his second chapter, Spencer focuses on the poor social class, reporting certain areas in London, and blaming the existence of poverty in these classes, and in a crude manner, its problems to the society as a whole, on the certain systems of that society in which the hard work of the young are not rewarded and tend to incline to criminality: such as the religious ones, in which, he argues, waste time reporting things which do not relate to the truth.

The group now had a parent company incorporated in Beijing (as China Everbright Group, was known as , incorporated in 1990 but could be traced back to , the name used in the document of the State Council) and a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong (China Everbright Holdings Co., Ltd. was known as Violight Industry Co., Ltd. from 1983 to 1984). Due to foreign exchange controls, the main overseas businesses were centered on the Hong Kong-based subsidiary. Everbright Group founded China Everbright Bank in 1992, the stake in the bank was diluted by the subscription of new shares by Central Huijin Investment in 2007, as well as Everbright Group injected part of the stake of the bank to Everbright Group's subsidiary: China Everbright Limited in 1997.

It originally aired on April 22, 2015. The episode was written by Rick Wiener & Kenny Schwartz, and directed by Beth McCarthy Miller. In the episode, Jay joins Cameron's bowling team to replace an injured player, not knowing that he will have to be (act) gay to play in this league Mitchell and Gloria want to prove that they are not old, so they accept Haley's offer to go clubbing all night. Phil and Claire finally come closer to their new neighbors, Ronnie and Amber, over a sculpture that they all dislike, helping them discover other things they have in common. \\"Knock 'Em Down\\" received positive reviews from the critics. Plot Phil (Ty Burrell) tries to sell a house but the buyers take back their offer when they see a pornographic sculpture decorating a neighbor's home. Phil finds out that surprisingly Ronnie (Steve Zahn) and Amber (Andrea Anders) hate the statue too and when they ask him and Claire (Julie Bowen) to join them at restaurant for dinner they accept the offer. During the dinner, Claire and Phil discover that they share a lot of common things with the LaFontaine couple and on their way home, Ronnie, Claire and Amber decide to destroy the sculpture. Phil, who is the only one who objects, actually becomes responsible for destroying it after accidentally crashing into it with Ronnie's car. As a cop walks by wanting to check about the sculpture, Phil recognizes him as one of his clients and lets him believe that the four of them were just eating and had nothing to do with the accident. Jay (Ed O'Neill) accepts to join Cameron's (Eric Stonestreet) bowling team for the night to replace an injured friend. However, since you have to be gay to be in the team and be able to participate, Cameron told everyone that Jay is gay except from Jay himself, at least not until they get there. As Cameron's rival Martin (Oliver Platt) tells Cameron that Jay is straight, Cameron lets him believe that Jay is only acting weird making because he is attracted to him. Cameron's team wins the game with Jay's help but when Martin nervously approaches Jay and asks him out, Jay's conscience lets him do the right thing and he softly admits to Martin that he is actually heterosexual. This ultimately disqualifies Cameron's team, allowing Martin's team to win and get the trophy. In the meantime, Haley (Sarah Hyland) invites Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Gloria (Sofia Vergara) to go clubbing with her one night and the two of them accept wanting to prove Jay and Cameron that they can still have fun and stay up all night. Whilst the night begins well, as the time passes, both Mitchell and Gloria fall asleep, realizing that they are no longer young as they were and Cameron was right that they were unable to stay up to go clubbing. Haley wakes them up and they convince themselves to try again and they join Haley, only to give in and change their opinion mere moments later, admitting that they are old for clubbing. At the end of the episode, Alex (Ariel Winter) sees her parents talking with the LaFontaines and tells Luke (Nolan Gould) that art is the best way to connect people. When she learns that he was actually trying to draw the sculpture, she advises him not to speak to her again, and Luke labels her a hypocrite. Reception Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Knock 'Em Down\\" was watched by 8.85; down by 0.58 from the previous episode. Reviews \\"Knock 'Em Down\\" received positive reviews from the critics. Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B grade, saying \\"Modern Family so often starts with the standard sitcom trope, but the show really excels when it rises above the norm and takes a different turn. This happens in two out of three of the shuffled- character plots in this episode\\". Despite being critical of the Haley-Gloria- Mitchell subplot, Ihnat did however praise Sarah Hyland's performance, stating \\"Sarah Hyland, as usual, does her game best, offering them the cocktails of their relative peoples, mojitos and cosmos, and suggesting that they go dancing in the daytime instead.\\" Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic also praised the episode, rating it with 4.2/5. Sumerel heavily praised the Cameron and Jay plot, saying \\"These are my favorite kinds of stories for Jay. I love seeing him break out of his comfort zone, especially as he becomes more and more open-minded\\". Sumerel also praised the Haley-Gloria-Mitchell subplot and Haley's characterization, saying \\"It says something about the close relationship she has with all of them that they can share these experiences, and it may also be another way we can define this family as a \\"modern\\" one\\". Lisa Fernandes of Next Projection also enjoyed the episode, rating it with 8.1/10. Fernandes praised the Jay and Cameron storyline, saying \\"Most of the best chunks of the storyline come from Oliver Platt‚Äôs appearance as Cam‚Äôs latest rival, where he manages to wring a deadpan acerbicness from his rotely written character\\". Fernandes also praised Julie Bowen's performance, by saying \\"Julie Bowen‚Äôs funny, elastic performance is the best one here, though Steve Zahn continues to apply a cool sense of reserve to his every appearance as the LaFontaine paterfamilias\\".

It is differentiated from its predecessor by inclusion of a GPS module with AstroTracer functionality (automatic tracking of the passage of stars across the sky, i.e. compensation of the rotation of the Earth; allows sharper, more detailed (less noisy) astrophotographs from longer exposures) and by \\"Pixel Shift Resolution\\", a capture mode giving higher spatial resolution. The integrated GPS module can also record positions of the camera while not in use, which allows subsequently reconstructing the path taken by the photographer. The GPS module occupies the space formerly given to the onboard flash, which has been omitted. Pixel Shift Resolution records four separate images in quick succession and combines them into a final image. The higher spatial resolution results from the fact that the sensor is shifted by one pixel between each pair of sequential exposures, such that all four colour filters in the Bayer pattern are applied once for each pixel (two green, one red, one blue). Therefore, the full colour spectrum is available for each pixel, giving more accurate (non-interpolated) colour and higher resolution. Pixel Shift images can be saved as JPEG or RAW, as can normal images. A Pixel Shift RAW file contains embedded in it the original four captures in RAW format. This capture mode is best used for static subjects, as approximately 1.3 seconds pass between the first and last exposure. This also dictates use of a tripod or other stabilisation for the camera. Of further note is the image stabilisation system, which according to CIPA standard has been improved from 3.5 to 4.5 stops in effectiveness since the K-3. The manufacturer further states that autofocus has been improved. Compatible Lenses The Pentax K-3 II is compatible with the KAF, KAF2, and KAF3 lens mounts.

The first game in the series, Nekopara Vol. 1, was released on December 30, 2014. The series is set in a world where humans live alongside catgirls, known as \\"Nekos\\". An all-ages anime OVA adaptation was released on Steam in December 2017; it became one of the top earners in Steam in December 2017.http://store.steampowered.com/sale/2017_top_new_releases/ An anime television series adaptation by Felix Film premiered from January 9 to March 26, 2020. The anime is licensed in English-speaking regions by Funimation. Gameplay Nekopara is a visual novel series, so the majority of the gameplay consists of the player reading the game's story. Nekopara does not offer choices to the player throughout gameplay, and the player has no influence over the story. The games are fully voiced (except for the protagonist) and use a system called \\"E-mote\\" that allows the in-game characters to be animated, instead of stationary sprites. Nekopara Vol. 0 added a new feature where the player can click on characters in-game, to \\"pet\\" them. The characters will react in different ways depending on where the player pets them. Plot Vol. 0 This prequel to Vol. 1 provides a look at a day in the life of Shigure and the six catgirls in the family home. There is little to no involvement of the previous protagonist Kashou Minaduki. Vol. 1 Kashou Minaduki is an aspiring chef who moves away from home to open his own confection shop. While he is unpacking in his new shop, he discovers that two of his family's Nekos, Chocola and Vanilla, came along with him by hiding in cardboard boxes. After the two Nekos convince Kashou to let them stay and live with him, the three of them work together to run his shop, La Soleil. During the story, Kashou receives a couple of visits from his younger sister Shigure and the other four Nekos owned by their family. Vol. 2 Shigure and the other four Nekos, Azuki, Cinnamon, Maple, and Coconut, begin working at La Soleil. This part focuses primarily on Azuki and Coconut and their sometimes contentious relationship as they struggle to find their place at the shop. Vol. 3 The story of La Soleil continues. This part focuses primarily on Cinnamon and Maple and their strong relationship when Maple is trying to make a dream come true. Extra Taking place six months before Vol 1, this part focuses on the Minaduki household back when Chocola and Vanilla were kittens struggling to adapt to the family.

It is the lower section of a hydrogeological system, a losing stream, that begins at the base of Collier Glacier in the Cascade Range. This lower section rises from a spring complex north of Oregon Route 242 (McKenzie Highway) in the Cascade Range and flows generally northwest to meet the river near Belknap Springs. This is near the intersection of Route 242 with Oregon Route 126 and about upstream of the McKenzie's confluence with the Willamette River. Geology Lost Creek was thus named because, if its main tributary, White Branch, is included in the reckoning, it is a disappearing stream for some of its course. White Branch flows on the surface at its headwaters then disappears before re-emerging about further downstream. After resurfacing, it enters Lost Creek from the left slightly downstream of the source spring. An article in The Ore Bin, a publication of the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, explains that White Branch begins at Collier Glacier and follows a glacial trough filled with porous lava. For much of the year, a long stretch of White Branch is dry on the surface. Some of the water percolating through the lava emerges at the spring complex at the head of Lost Creek. Other water in White Branch enters the main stem as a surface tributary. The total length of the Lost Creek ‚Äì White Branch system is about , of which Lost Creek forms about .

It is today (2015) a national cultural monument of the Czech Republic Plo≈°tina was a small settlement situated near to Vala≈°sk√© Klobouky, Zl√≠n District, Moravian Wallachia, today's Czech Republic. On April 19, 1945, at the end of World War II, it was burned and its people were massacred by Nazis in response to their support of the anti-Nazi resistance movement. The massacre was conducted by the German special SS unit Zur besonderen Verwendung-Kommando Nr. 31, led by Walter Pawlofski, and by the SS anti-partisan unit Josef consisting of members of Slovak Hlinka-Guard, whose headquarters was in Vizovice. Twenty-four people were burned alive, three more people were executed, and one person was tortured to death during interrogation.  Background  After the unsuccessful Slovak National Uprising, part of the resistance movement centered in Moravian Wallachia. Partisans formed armed groups along with local volunteers under Soviet commanders. They searched for help from villagers from surrounding settlements, who provided them with food, shelter, and basic treatment, and sometimes even helped them with military actions. The unit operating near Plo≈°tina was, however, infiltrated by Gestapo confidants and traitors who informed Nazis about the collaboration. This led to the punitive action conducted by Nazis on April 19, 1945, a few days before the end of World War II. According to Bo≈æena H√∫≈°≈•ov√°, a witness whose brother was killed during the massacre, the men were forced to enter burning houses after a detonation of hidden ammunition in one of the houses. Those who attempted to escape were shot. A similar tragedy occurred on April 23, 1945 in the nearby village of Prlov, where fifteen people were burned, three hanged and one shot. The last Nazi punitive action occurred in the settlement Va≈ô√°kovy Paseky on May 2 and 3, 1945. Four people were killed and eight houses burned. SS-Mann Werner Tutter (1909-1983), a commander of the unit Josef during the massacre in Plo≈°tina, was sentenced to six years in prison in 1948. While serving his sentence, he was contacted by the Communist Czechoslovak State Security Service (StB). In 1953, he became an agent of StB and worked for Communist Czechoslovakia in West Germany, under the code name Konrad II. His criminal past was revealed again in 1962, but the investigation was interrupted and Tutter died as an honorable German citizen in 1983.  Legacy  Ladislav M≈àaƒçko, writer and a member of the partisan group \\"Plo≈°tina\\", described this tragedy in his book Death Is Called Engelchen. The topic was also developed in the 1963 Czechoslovak war film Death Is Called Engelchen, directed by J√°n Kad√°r and Elmar Klos.

He was murdered in 2014. Following the assassination of Serbia's Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá on 12 March 2003, Rakonjac was among those arrested during Operation Sablja. Although he had strong connections to the Serbian mafia, Rakonjac was never officially convicted of any major crime. His only charge during his lifetime was for the illegal possession of a firearm.

According to Oregon Geographic Names, Sharps Creek was named for James H. \\"Bohemia\\" Sharp, a local prospector and road builder. The \\"Bohemia\\" in Sharp's nickname stemmed from another miner, James Johnson, who in 1863 found lode gold deposits on the mountain. Earlier prospectors had found placer gold in the creek in 1858. Johnson was nicknamed \\"Bohemia\\" because he had grown up in Bohemia in eastern Europe. He and other miners organized the Bohemia Gold and Silver Mining District (later referred to as the Bohemia mining district) in 1867.

Early life  Honyman was the second son of Sir William Honyman, 1st Baronet, SCJ (Lord Armadale), of Armadale in Sutherland and Graemsay in Orkney. His mother Mary was a daughter of the notorious judge Lord Braxfield. The family claimed maternal descent from Sir Robert Stewart, an illegitimate son of King James V of Scotland. He was educated in England at Eton, and in 1806 he joined the British East India Company as a writer (junior clerk). After several promotions he became deputy commercial resident in Ramnad in 1809, and returned to Britain in 1811. He finally left the East India Company in 1816.  Career Honyman's father Sir William had large landholdings in Orkney, where he had exerted significant influence on the parliamentary representation since the 1780s. Sir William's brother Robert Honyman (‚Äì1848) had been returned as Orkney's MP from 1796 to 1806, when he was succeeded by Sir William's oldest son Colonel Robert Honyman until 1807. The Colonel had died of fever in Jamaica in 1808, and when Sir William's negotiations secured the seat for his family again at the 1812 general election, Richard Honyman enjoyed the support of the outgoing Whig MP Malcolm Laing. Honyman won eight of the twelve votes cast. He is not known to have spoken in Parliament, and was not a frequent attender in the Commons. He initially voted with the Whigs, but by 1813 Sir William was reported to have settled his differences with Henry Dundas's son Robert Dundas, 2nd Viscount Melville who was by then First Lord of the Admiralty in the government of Lord Liverpool. Thereafter Richard voted with the Tories, and at the 1818 general election he was defeated by 12 votes to 19 by the Whig candidate Royal Navy Captain George Dundas. The Balfour, Baikie and Traill families of Orkney had agreed to end the three- decade Honyman hegemony. They allied themselves with the Dundas of Kerse (descendants of Thomas Dundas of Fingask, unrelated to the Lords Melville) who the Honymans had displaced in the 1780s. The alliance faltered at the 1820 election, when objections were raised to the age of the 70-year-old Whig candidate John Balfour, and to the lack of consultation before his nomination. Honyman was nominated again, by Alexander Henderson of Stempster and seconded by Gilbert Traill; but Balfour won the seat by 19 votes to Honyman's 14. Sir William Honyman died on 5 January 1825. Due to the death of Colonel Robert, Richard's elder brother, in 1808, Richard was thereby the oldest surviving son, and succeeded to his father's baronetcy and estates.  Family  The grave of Lady Elizabeth Campbell Honyman, Rosebank Cemetery, Edinburgh Honyman married Elizabeth Campbell (1784-1874), with whom he had one daughter. Elizabeth is buried in Rosebank Cemetery in north Edinburgh. He died on 23 February 1842, and having no male heir the baronetcy passed to his father's second surviving son Ord (1794‚Äì1863). Richard Honyman is buried against the eastern outer wall of the southern section of St Cuthbert's churchyard in Edinburgh. The marble monument is eroded and its legibility is fading.

It enjoys a high degree of domestic, legislative and political autonomy through its ancient Parliament Tynwald. By convention, the United Kingdom Government is responsible for the conduct of the international relations and defence of the island. The Isle of Man does not have a written constitution, or a Bill of Rights which sets out its Human Rights. These rights are addressed in the Human Rights Act 2001.Human Rights Act 2001 The island has also ratified a number of international treaties. Legal framework International treaties The Isle of Man has ratified six of the nine core human rights treaties. Namely the: * International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) * International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) * International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) * Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) * Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) * Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT) As a Crown Dependency, The United Kingdom (UK) is responsible for the international relations for the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man is not subject to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process as it is not a member state of the United Nations. However, in its reports on the UK, the UPR often gives recommendations to the UK to urge its overseas territories to implement its recommendations. The Isle of Man has agreed to some UPR recommendations such as ratifying the Optional Protocol on the Convention against Torture in 2014.UPR mid-term report 2014 European Convention on Human Rights The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was ratified by the UK in 1951 and in 1953; the UK extended the Convention to the Isle of Man.Information on the Human Rights Act . The ECHR was used in the Isle of Man to protect its citizen‚Äôs human rights and fundamental freedoms. The ECHR established the European Court of Human Rights, where any individual who feels his or her rights have been violated under the Convention can take their case to the Court. The judgements of the Court are binding on the States concerned. The Convention extends fundamental human rights to individuals such as the right to life, the right to a fair trial and freedom of expression. Human Rights Act 2001 The Human Rights Act was passed by Tynwald in 2001 and came fully into force on 1 November 2006. This Act is similar in many respects to the UK Human Rights Act. The Act incorporates the fundamental rights and freedoms set out in the ECHR into its domestic law. Previously, an Isle of Man resident who believed that their rights had been violated had to go to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France to have their case heard. This process could be long and expensive and so the Government decided that the public should be able to guarantee their rights on the Isle of Man. The Human Rights Act ensures that all public authorities act in a way which is compliant with the main articles of the ECHR. The rights enshrined within the Act are designed to protect the individual against any abuses by the State. They are not designed to settle disputes between individuals. If the Act cannot be interpreted in a way which complies with the Convention, a declaration of incompatibility can be made. This is a sign to Tynwald that the law should be changed, but there is no obligation for Tynwald to do so. If Tynwald do not amend the law, then the applicant can take their case to the ECHR. Human rights issues Right to life Under pressure from the UK government, and to meet ECHR requirements, the death penalty was abolished in 1993 on the Isle of Man; however the last execution had not taken place since 1872. The Isle of Man was the last place in the British Isles to formally abolish the death penalty. Electoral rights The House of Keys has 24 members, elected for a five-year term. The Isle of Man lowered its voting age from 18 to 16 in 2006.Representation of the People Act 1995 The Isle of Man became the first action for women‚Äôs suffrage by granting women who owned property the right to vote in 1881. Employment rights The Employment Act 2006 sets out a number of employee and employer rights on the Isle of Man such as the right to a minimum wage, the right to a minimum period of notice and unfair dismissals.Employment Act 2006 Pursuant to the Miniumum Wage Act 2001, the Isle of Man has a minimum wage committee who determine different minimum wage amounts depending on the age of the employee.s 2(1) Minimum Wage Act 2001 Access to justice Article 6 of the Human Rights Act states that everyone is entitled to the right to a fair trial.Human Rights Act 2001 There has been concern that the current human rights structures on the Isle of Man do not sufficiently represent the deaf population as the island does not have appropriately qualified persons to assist deaf individuals in arrests and trials which has resulted in questions about the legitimacy of legal outcomes. In 2014, the Legal Aid Committee implemented a fundamental review of the island‚Äôs legal aid system to determine the future shape of access to justice for those who do not have the means to pay for it. Committee chairman Andrew Swithinbank stated: \\"The focus of the committee is to promote access to justice in a manner which is fair, equitable, transparent and professional and which uses public resources carefully and effectively.\\" Rights of persons with disabilities The Disability Discrimination Act 2006 was given royal assent in October 2006 after it was approved by the branches of Tynwald. This Act was designed to demand minimum levels of accessibility for disabled people to buildings and prevent discrimination against disabled people in the supply of goods and services. The Act however, still remains to be implemented. In May 2011, the then chief minister Tony Brown stated ‚Äúthe Disability Discrimination Act is recognised as an important piece of legislation, however before the act is brought into effect a programme of assessment, education and improvements must take place.‚Äù The House of Keys has repeatedly failed to give a deadline for when the Act will be implemented. LGBT rights In April 2016 the Isle of Man approved The Marriage and Civil Partnership (Amendment) Billhttp://www.tynwald.org.im/business/bills/Bills/Marriage_(Same_Sex_Couples)_Bill_2016-amended.pdf legalizing same-sex marriage. Same-sex couples have been allowed to enter civil partnerships, but not marriage, since April 2011. Since the early 1990s, the Isle of Man has relaxed its position with regards to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. Prior to 1992, same-sex sexual activity was a criminal offence. Post de-criminalisation, the age of consent was set at 21 and then reduced to 18 by the Criminal Justice Act 2001.Criminal Justice Act 2001 In 2006 s4(a) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2006 further lowered the minimum age for homosexual acts to 16, thus aligning it with the same age of consent for heterosexual acts.s 4(a) Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2006 They have also been given more rights with regard to employment protection from discrimination (2006), gender recognition (2009), the right to enter into civil partnerships and the right to adopt children (2011).LGBT rights in the Isle of Man However, it continues to apply special legal regulation to adult male homosexual sex. Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 1992 contains a number of provisions which criminalise certain ‚Äúunnatural offences‚Äù between men. Sections 9(1) and 9(4) respectively criminalise ‚Äòbuggery‚Äô and ‚Äògross indecency‚Äô between men if one party is under the age of sixteen or if the acts are committed ‚Äúelsewhere than in private.‚Äùs 9(1) Sexual Offences Act 1992s 9(4) Sexual Offences Act 1992 Section 10(1) provides buggery and gross indecency will not be considered to be in private if ‚Äúmore than two persons are present‚Äù or if the act is done in ‚Äúany place to which the public have or are permitted to have access to, whether on payment or otherwise.‚Äùs 10(1) Sexual Offences Act 1992 In 2013 a local Independent Methodist minister refused to rent a house to two women because they were in a same sex relationship, causing international outrage. However, due to the Isle of Man‚Äôs failure to bring in an Equality Act, the discrimination was legal. An Equality Bill, based upon the UK Equality Act 2010 to update the island‚Äôs discrimination laws was swiftly put into drafting process. In early 2017 both houses of Tynwald passed the equality bill with many amendments. In July, 2017 the Equality Bill became the Equality Act after royal assent and will go into effect from July 2019. Corporal punishment Birching was a form of corporal punishment used on the Isle of Man during the 1960s and 1970s. It was principally the form of punishment for boys under 15 convicted of stealing, however was altered in 1960 so that birching could be used on males up to 21 years of age. In 1972 the case of Tyrer v The United Kingdom went to Human Rights Court. By a majority of six votes to one, the Court held Tyrer's birching to constitute degrading treatment contrary to the Article 3 of the ECHR. This was labelled a landmark decision by Manfred Nowak, UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment It wasn't until 1993 that birching was formally repealed in the Isle of Man. Under Article 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1966, parents have the right to administer ‚Äúreasonable chastisement‚Äù to children. The Global Initiative to end all corporal punishment of children prepared a report in 2013 suggesting the Isle of Man repeal a number of statutes relating to corporal punishment of children by all persons with authority over children.Global Initiative to end all corporal punishment of children This included persons in day care centres, schools and penal institutions. However, the Isle of Man has been reluctant to do so, declining to implement UPR recommendations to the UK in both 2008 and 2013 for it to ban corporal punishment on children in its overseas territories.Global Initiative to end all corporal punishment of children The Isle of Man stated that it does not see the need for reform as it believes the current law is working well and that parents should be allowed to discipline children.

For example, Article 10 of the latter provides that all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (opened for signature 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976), art 10.1.

Accessed May 20, 2018. http://www.corrections.govt.nz/resources/research_and_statistics/quarterly_prison_statistics/prison_stats_march_2017.html Initially women were held in the same prisons as men. It was not until 1913, and after much protest, that the first women's prison was established, at Addington. By 2018, New Zealand had established three female prisons: Auckland Women's Correction Facility, Arohata, and Christchurch Women's Corrections Facility. Male imprisonment Men are regularly given longer sentences than women for the same crimes, consequently enhancing the statistics for male prisoners. By 2018, New Zealand established 15 male prisons which are scattered around the North and South Island. Female prisoners have often been held in male prisons due to the overflowing prison population. Since the 1940s, prison capacities have grown rapidly, especially between 1995 and 2007, during which the number of incarcerated persons increased by 70%. The population continues to rapidly grow and reached the highest numbers in 2015 and 2016, ultimately peaking New Zealand's in 2017.Department of Corrections. \\"Increasing prison population.\\" Accessed May 16, 2018. http://www.corrections.govt.nz/resources/strategic_reports/annual- reports/annual_report_/increasing_prison_population.html Maori imprisonment MƒÅori are well over-represented at all levels of the criminal justice system. Prison statistics are no different. In 1840 MƒÅori represented 3% of prisoners. In 2014 this had risen to 50.8%, despite MƒÅori only making up 15% of the population.  History  The first New Zealand prisons originated in the 1840s; they reflected English influence and practice. By 1878 the Colony had 30 small prisons. They were flimsy, underfunded and under- resourced. For example, New Plymouth Prison comprised two cells and a small outdoor yard. From early on, the prison system was heavily criticized for the day-to-day conditions prisoners endured - such as damp, cramped cells and long hours of isolation. A Royal Commission of Inquiry in 1868 failed to precipitate any changes. In 1880 a standardized prison system was introduced under the watch of Arthur Hume, the first Inspector General of Prisons.Crawford, J.A.B. (30 October 2012). \\"Hume, Arthur\\". Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand. This new system focused on economical administration and acting as a reformative deterrent to crime. Conditions became harsher for those on the inside, including rations being cut and communications between prisoners prohibited. In 1909 (and coincidentally, upon Captain Hume's retirement), prison reform was sought. The Crimes Amendment Act 1910 saw teachers appointed to the prisons, allowed for small wages to be paid to prisoners, and allowed for the release of prisoners on probation.Crimes Amendment Act 1910. From 1949 to 1960, Sam Barnett, the Secretary of Justice, was in charge of the prison system. Under Barnetts' administration, extensive reforms took place. This included greater rations, improved education and library resources, appointment of prison psychologists and improved recreation- and welfare-services. Periodic detention was also introduced, which allowed for supervised community work. From the 1950s prison populations (known in New Zealand as the \\"prison muster\\") rapidly increased, in line with the increasing crime-rate. the Corrections Act 2004 provides the legislative framework for the administration of the prison systemCorrections Act 2004, s 5. by the Department of Corrections. Today there is a wider range of sentences available, including (but not limited to) community work, supervision, community detention, home detention and imprisonment. Sentencing Amendment Act 2007 (2007 No 27), S 10A. Controversial rights The rights of prisoners invoke differing views. Below are some rights that have caused controversy in recent times, namely the right to vote, preventive detention and prisoners with mental health issues. Right to vote New Zealand has long enjoyed the status of being a world leader when it comes to voting rights. On 19 September 1893, New Zealand became the first country to allow women the right to vote.Electoral Act 1983. This can be largely accredited to the advocating efforts of Kate Sheppard. Today, the right to vote is expressly provided for in domestic legislation; both in section 12 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and section 74 of the Electoral Act 1993 and international treaties New Zealand is party to, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Despite this, prisoners serving a term of three years or more, life imprisonment, or preventive detention are barred from electoral registration, and therefore from casting their electoral vote.Electoral (Disqualification of Sentenced Prisoners) Act 2010, s 80(1)(d). At present, this equates to roughly 2550 prisoners. Taking away the right to vote originated from early Roman times when those arrested were declared ‚Äúcivilly dead‚Äù.Greg Robins \\"The Rights of Prisoners to Vote: A review of Prisoner Disenfranchisement in New Zealand\\" (Law Clerk, Wellington, 2007)Revised version of paper written in 2005 for LLB(Hons) program at Victoria University of Wellington In the last century the rights of prisoners to vote has swung back and forth. In 1852 all prisoners were barred from voting.New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 (UK). In 1975 we saw a complete turnaround and all prisoners were again allowed the right to vote.Electoral Amendment Act 1975. In 2010, the Fifth National Government passed the Electoral (Disqualification of Sentenced Prisoners) Act 2010, which stripped all prisoners of the right to vote while serving their sentences. Those advocating for the ban argue that punishment for prisoners should include the loss of some rights to reflect the seriousness of the crime.Royal Commission on the Electoral System. Report of the Royal Commission on the Electoral System: Towards a Better Democracy (Government Printer, Wellington, 1986) para 9.21 and recommendation 42. In addition, there are also a number of practical difficulties. For example, if prisoners were allowed to vote this would disproportionately affect an electorate. At the time of the enactment, the then Solicitor General John McGrath QC also argued that a partial ban is more justifiable than a complete blanket ban.J J McGrath QC, Solicitor-General,to W A Moore the Secretary for Justice \\"Rights of Prisoners to Vote: Bill of Rights\\" (17 November 1992) Letter, para 25. On the other hand, the barring is controversial because it denies fundamental civil liberties to persons who have already been punished for their crimes. Furthermore, the abolition of such a right stands in stark contrast to the world trend of widening civil liberties of prisoners, with the exception of Australia who has recently introduced a blanket ban on prisoner's right to vote.Greg Robins \\"The Rights of Prisoners to Vote: A review of Prisoner Disenfranchisement in New Zealand\\" (Law Clerk, Wellington, 2007) Revised version of paper written in 2005 for LLB(Hons) program at Victoria University of Wellington This denial also sets a dangerous precedent for the removal of other human rights for prisoners,Arthur Taylor \\"No prisoner voting rights a dangerous precedent\\" The New Zealand Herald (New Zealand, 27 January 2015) online ed. and also contributes to inequality of all persons.General Assembly's Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 (UDHR) In the 2015 decision of Taylor v Attorney-General,Taylor v Attorney-General [2015] NZHC 1706, the High Court made a formal declaration that a statute that prohibited prisoners from voting is inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The decision was later upheld by the Court of Appeal.Attorney-General v Taylor [2017] NZCA 215. The judge declared that the Electoral (Disqualification of Sentenced Prisoners) Amendment Act 2010, which stripped all voting rights in general elections from prisoners, was an unjustified limitation on the right to vote contained in s 12 of the Bill of Rights and unable to be justified under that Act.Taylor v Attorney- General [2015] NZHC 1706, at [33] A formal declaration of inconsistency was issued as a result of the case.Taylor v Attorney-General [2015] NZHC 1706, at [77]. This was the first time a court had recognised that a formal declaration of inconsistency is an available remedy for statutory breaches of the Bill of Rights. On 23 November 2019, the Minister of Justice Andrew Little announced that the Sixth Labour Government would be amending the Electoral Amendment Bill to allow prisoners who had been sentenced to less than three years in prison to vote in time for the 2020 New Zealand general election; reversing the previous National Government's decision to ban all prisoners from voting. While Little's announcement was welcomed by Green MP Golriz Ghahraman and prisoner advocates, National Party leader Simon Bridges criticised the Government for being \\"soft on crime\\" and vowed that a National Government would reverse any such law change. Preventive detention Preventive detention is a special type of sentence provided for under section 87 of the Sentencing Act 2002. In New Zealand's justice system, preventative detention has been imposed on convicted criminals for decades, but has been used with increasing frequency since the 1980s, and is described It is a form of imprisonment, with no release date until approved by the Parole Board. It occurs when the individual is defined as ‚Äúa dangerous person and is assessed as posing a substantial risk of grave harm to the public or specific individuals.‚Äù The decision to sentence a person to preventive decision relies heavily on predicting the individual's likelihood of committing future crimes.Sentencing Policy and Guidance: A discussion paper: Sentencing dangerous offenders. Ministry of Justice. 1997. Preventive detention is heavily criticized because it is a form of arbitrary detainment where a person has not actually been charged with, or convicted of an offence, but poses a risk of offending. Several provisions under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 are relevant, namely: * Section 9: Everyone has the right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, degrading, or disproportionately severe treatment or punishment.New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 9. * Section 22: Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained, andNew Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 22. * Section 27: Every person has the right to the observance of the principles of natural justice by any tribunal or other public authority which has the power to make a determination in respect of that person's rights, obligations or interests protected or recognized by law.New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 27. Despite this, section 5 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 limits these rights where it can be ‚Äúdemonstrably justified in a free and democratic society‚Äù.New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s 5. The limitation of human rights was discussed in Moonen v Film and Literature Board of Review (1999) which remains the relevant authority today.Moonen v Film and Literature Board of Review 17 CRNZ 159 (1999). Preventive detention is justified on the basis that it only applies to a small group of offenders who fit the definition of a ‚Äúdangerous person and is assessed as posing a substantial risk of grave harm to the public or specific individuals‚Äù and relies on the exercise of discretion when certain conditions are met. In a report by the Human Rights Committee dated 15 December 2003, the Committee was of the view that preventive detention was not arbitrary, nor did it offend the principle of the presumption of innocence.HRC Report on Preventive Detention in NZ. However, there remains strong opposition to preventive detention. It was stated by the dissenting members in the same Human Rights Committee report that ‚ÄúTo rely on a prediction of dangerousness is tantamount to replacing presumption of innocence with guilt‚Äù. It is also important to note that in order to be released by the Parole Board, a prisoner must have completed a number of training and rehabilitation programmes. However, there is a shortage of these programs.Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Report on the visit of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to New Zealand (2015). = United Nations criticism = In at least two decisions, the UN Human Rights Committee found that specific aspects of the preventative detention scheme violated human rights. In Rameka et al. v New Zealand the Human Rights Committee decided that an aspect of New Zealand's preventive detention scheme, violated article 9(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In April 2018, The UN Human Rights Committee found that New Zealand violated the rights of two men convicted of rape by keeping them in preventative detention without having provided them access to adequate rehabilitative programs in prison. While the committee did not rule categorically that preventative detention itself was a violation of human rights, they did write \\"The Committee considers that as the length of preventive detention increases, the State party bears an increasingly heavy burden to justify continued detention and to show that the threat posed by the individual cannot be addressed by alternative measures. As a result, a level of risk which might reasonably justify a short-term preventive detention, may not necessarily justify a longer period of preventive detention\\" . OPCAT reports In 2007 the New Zealand Government ratified the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT). The objective of OPCAT is to establish a system of regular visits undertaken by an independent national body to places where people are deprived of their liberty, in order to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/501/OPCAT_Hawkes_Bay_Prison_Inspection_Report.pdf In New Zealand, the Office of the Omudsman performs inspections. The Ombudsman also has responsibility under the Crimes of Torture Act (COTA) for examining and monitoring the general conditions and treatment of detainees in New Zealand prisons. The Ombudsman has criticised the Department of Corrections in a recent series of reports and investigations, citing ongoing issues with privacy, young persons, prisoner meal times and segregation facilities. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1580/original/monitoring__places_of_detention_2015.pdf?1466558391. Site visits are viewed and promoted as initiating an ongoing dialogue with detaining agencies, rather than a one-off engagement. With respect to prisons, the Office of the Ombudsman has addressed a wide range of issues arising in prisons including non-smoking policies, cell temperatures, double bunking and surrounding risk assessment procedures and provisions for prisoner privacy, lock-down hours and exercise facilities in prisons, and food quality and dining facilities in prison. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1582/original/2014_opcat_annual_report.pdf?1466558416 From 2011- 2013 the Ombudsman office directed their focus to segregations issues. Issues that the Office has reported on include: the level of consistency in segregation, conditions for segregated prisoners, the quality of segregation records, reintegration programs and minimum entitlements. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1581/original/opcat_2013_final_report.pdf?1466558409 In addition to the issue of segregation, the Office has examined issues associated with condensed meal times and the use (and recording and investigation) of force and restraint. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1581/original/opcat_2013_final_report.pdf?1466558409 In 2015 the Human Rights Commission's annual report on places of detention raised significant rights concerns including privacy, segregation, mental health services and youth facilities. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1580/original/monitoring__places_of_detention_2015.pdf?1466558391 In 2017, the Office of the Omudsman released two OPCAT reports by the Chief Ombudsman following unannounced inspections to Hawkes Bay prison Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/501/OPCAT_Hawkes_Bay_Prison_Inspection_Report.pdf and Spring Hill Corrections Facility Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/522/OPCAT_Spring_Hill_report_PDF.pdf under the Crimes of Torture Act 1989. The reports are the first to be released by the Ombudsman who has said further inspections will continue around the country with the findings to be made public. The reports identified multiple areas of concern. =Privacy concerns= Multiple reports have suggested privacy issues for prisoners. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1580/original/monitoring__places_of_detention_2015.pdf?1466558391 Areas of particular concern were segregated facilities, at risk units and external shower blocks. Cells used to segregate prisoners‚Äô, referred to as management cells, separate cells, or punishment cells are used to describe a form of confinement where prisoners are held alone in a cell for up to 24 hours a day, and are only allowed to leave it for outdoor exercise generally for an hour's duration. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1580/original/monitoring__places_of_detention_2015.pdf?1466558391 At risk prisoners are normally separated due to mental health concerns. Prisoners‚Äô can be placed in segregation facilities for various reasons including, staff and prisoner security, punishment for misconduct and for isolation as a long-term strategy for managing challenging and disruptive behavior. Both facilities are heavily monitored via cameras and guards routinely perform in-person visual checks in the cells as individuals in these facilities require extra monitoring. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/501/OPCAT_Hawkes_Bay_Prison_Inspection_Report.pdf Concern has been raised over the privacy afforded to prisoners with inadequate privacy guards under such monitoring. Guards, of either sex, are able to see prisoners in various stages of undress, naked, showering or using toilets through cell doors and from cameras in the cells. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1580/original/monitoring__places_of_detention_2015.pdf?1466558391 The Chief Ombudsman has recommended that measures should be undertaken to better protect the privacy of prisoners when they are naked, partially naked, or undertaking their ablutions. The ombudsman also concluded that this lack of privacy amounts to degrading treatment or punishment for the purpose of the Convention Against Torture. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/522/OPCAT_Spring_Hill_report_PDF.pdf =Fresh air= Concerns have been raised over whether prisoners are being afforded their basic rights to fresh air in accordance with article 21(1) of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Providing access to fresh air was described as a challenge by Corrections staff, Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/522/OPCAT_Spring_Hill_report_PDF.pdf who could not provide assurance that prisoners were receiving their minimum entitlement. Ombudsman, Page 22, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/522/OPCAT_Spring_Hill_report_PDF.pdf An hour of exercise, in the open air weather permitting, is a minimum legal entitlement and statutory right under sections 69(1)(a) and 70 of the Corrections Act. There is no provision under the Act for this to be derogated from. Ombudsman, Page 25, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/501/OPCAT_Hawkes_Bay_Prison_Inspection_Report.pdf =Remand prisoners= In 2013, the United Nations Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture visited several New Zealand prisons, and stated that limited time out of cell and the limited range and provision of constructive activities were issues for remand prisoners that should be addressed. Ombudsman, Page 47, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/501/OPCAT_Hawkes_Bay_Prison_Inspection_Report.pdf In 2017, the regime for remand accused prisoners remained an issue and was deemed unsatisfactory by the Chief Ombudsman, despite the recommendations made by the United Nations Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture following its visit in 2013. Ombudsman, Page 6, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/501/OPCAT_Hawkes_Bay_Prison_Inspection_Report.pdf Additionally, the Chief Ombudsman has recommended that Remand accused prisoners should be managed separately from remand convicted and sentenced prisoners in line with Rule 11(b) of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Mandela Rules)). Ombudsman, Page 38, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/522/OPCAT_Spring_Hill_report_PDF.pdf =Youth prisoners= Following an Ombudsman inspection in 2017, recommendations were made that youth prisoners should not be housed in the Management Unit unless they are subject to a segregated directive. United Nations treaty bodies consistently recommend that juvenile offenders should not be subject to solitary confinement either as a disciplinary measure, or to separate them from the adult inmate population. Management cells were regularly used for non-segregated prisoners, including youth, when the muster was high. Ombudsman, Page 12, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/522/OPCAT_Spring_Hill_report_PDF.pdf The Ombudsman also reported on the mixing of remand and sentenced youth prisoners being housed in the same unit. Despite requests, inspectors were unable to view the necessary authorisations to allow different categories of youth to be mixed. Ombudsman, Page 36, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/501/OPCAT_Hawkes_Bay_Prison_Inspection_Report.pdf This is contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 10(2)(a), that Accused persons shall, except in exceptional circumstances, be kept separate from convicted persons and be treated in a manner appropriate to their status. =Meal times= Rule 22 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) states: \\"Every prisoner shall be provided by the prison administration at the usual hours with food of nutritional value adequate for health and strength, of wholesome quality and well prepared and served\\". Meal times across New Zealand Prisons do not reflect standard meal times. In 2012, 2013, and 2014 the Ombudsmen reported that the 8 am to 5 pm unlock regime has condensed the working day for many prisoners, including meal times, with some dinners being routinely served as early as 3.30 pm, leaving prisoners without meals for lengthy periods. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1580/original/monitoring__places_of_detention_2015.pdf?1466558391 Lunch was served at 11.10 am in Christchurch Women's Prison and the evening meal being served as early as 3.15 pm at MECF during the 2014-2015 reporting period. Human Rights Commission, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/system/paperclip/document_files/document_files/1580/original/monitoring__places_of_detention_2015.pdf?1466558391 At Hawkes Bay prison inspectors observed breakfast being issued in at 9.15 am, and lunch delivered to the units around 11am, issued to and eaten by prisoners before they were locked up by 11.45 am. The evening meal was delivered to the units as early as 2.55 pm and was issued and eaten on some units at 3.30 pm. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/501/OPCAT_Hawkes_Bay_Prison_Inspection_Report.pdf Corrections considers that the current meal times comply with section 72 of the Corrections Act 2004, which stipulates that every prisoner is provided with \\"a sufficient quantity of wholesome food and drink based on the food and nutritional guidelines for the time being issued by the Ministry of Health\\". Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/501/OPCAT_Hawkes_Bay_Prison_Inspection_Report.pdf There is no reference to the times food is served; rather, the focus is on quality and quantity. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/522/OPCAT_Spring_Hill_report_PDF.pdf The Chief Ombudsman reported that although the Corrections Act does not reference the time the food is served, the Nelson Mandela Rules require food to be served at the ‚Äòusual‚Äô time. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/522/OPCAT_Spring_Hill_report_PDF.pdf The Ombudsman deemed it inappropriate for meals to be served at non-standard hours. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/522/OPCAT_Spring_Hill_report_PDF.pdf Prisoners' mental health Prisoners are up to five times more likely to be affected by mental health disorders and illnesses than the general public.Working with offenders: being in prison: Health care Department of Corrections. The rate of prisoner suicide is 11 times higher than that of the general public.Mental health treatment and services in NZ prisons are inadequate. Just Speak. Section 75(1) of the Corrections Act 2004 provides that a prisoner is entitled to receive medical treatment that is reasonably necessary. All male prisoners over the age of 18 years are old, on their arrival to prison, are screened for any mental health issues. If deemed in need of ‚Äúmild or moderate‚Äù treatment they are then referred to the prison doctor or to a specialist provided by the District Health Board. In 2010 the National Health Committee published a report looking into prisoners mental health. The prison environment was clearly identified as being a contributing factor for reasons including overcrowding, assaults, sexual abuse, illicit drugs, frequent strip searches and separation from family networks. In the same report, a number of key issues were identified; including detrimental environmental factors, poor identification and treatment of mental health issues and conflict over whose responsibility prisoners mental health is, given it is not a core function of the Department of Corrections.National Health Committee. 2010. Health in Justice: Kia Piki te Ora, Kia Tika! ‚Äì Improving the health of prisoners and their families and whƒÅnau: He whakapiki i te ora o ngƒÅ mauhere me ≈ç rƒÅtou whƒÅnau. Wellington: Ministry of Health. Antonie Dixon exemplifies the failures identified above. In 2009, Mr Dixon committed suicide inside his at-risk cell. This was after several previous attempts inside the same prison. In his final moments, prison officers waited 7 minutes for other prison officers as back up, before entering the cell. It was held by Coroner Gary Evans that had Mr Dixon been correctly referred to mental health services, then he would still have been alive today. Tie-down beds and restraints In New Zealand, tie-down beds and restraints are not allowed in mental health facilities but may be used in detention facilities. In 2017 the Chief Ombudsman released a report \\"A Question of Restraint\\" that criticised the Department of Corrections for breaching the Convention against Torture, as well as the Corrections Act 2004. The report followed in-depth investigation into allegations of the use of tie-down beds and restraints. The report found incidents of at-risk prisoners being restrained on tie-down beds by their legs, arms, and chest over prolonged periods; and in waist restraints with their hands cuffed behind their backs. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/476/a_question_of_restraint_march_2017.pdf?1493251845 f The Chief Ombudsman's (OPCAT) inspectors found in one case at Auckland Prison, a prisoner was secured to a tie-down bed for 16 hours at a time, for 37 nights in a row. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/476/a_question_of_restraint_march_2017.pdf?1493251845f Judge Boshier says this prisoner spent 592 hours restrained on the tie-down bed, including in some cases being toileted on the bed. The prisoner's limbs were not moved during these prolonged periods of restraint. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/476/a_question_of_restraint_march_2017.pdf?1493251845 f In another case at Otago Corrections Facility, a prisoner was continuously kept in a waist restraint with his hands cuffed behind his back, after self- harming. The cuffs were used for 12 weeks prior to his release from prison, and were removed for two hours during the day, and every four hours at night. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/476/a_question_of_restraint_march_2017.pdf?1493251845f The prisoner was locked in his cell for 21 hours a day. Despite a recommendation that the prisoner be treated by an experienced psychologist, this did not occur during the 12 weeks he was restrained with handcuffs or prior to his release into the community. Ombudsman, http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/476/a_question_of_restraint_march_2017.pdf?1493251845f Following the investigation, the Chief Ombudsman, Judge Boshier, concluded that the use of the tie-down bed and/or waist restraints in the circumstances of five prisoners amounted to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for the purpose of Article 16 of the Convention against Torture.

Its Italian subtitle, Nel cuore dei cammini d'Europa, translates as \\"In the heart of Europe's paths\\". History of the route The path CoEUR was created in the late 1990s, when information about Saint Charles Borromeo's trips in the northern Piedmont was discovered, leading to the initiation of the Path of Saint Charles (Cammino di San Carlo) between Arona, the town where the Archbishop was born, and Viverone, the town where the Via Francigena passes through the province of Biella. This track has been used as a starting point the CoEUR path, which to link all the devotional places along the Lake Maggiore up to Locarno. In its ideal prosecution, the path reaches Einsiedeln abbey connecting the Via Francigena with the Camino de Santiago in its Swiss section, named Via Jacobi. This combination of paths creates a connection between two sanctuaries consecrated to the black Madonna: Oropa and Einsiedeln.  Sectors of the route   Path of Saint Charles  This path follows routes made by Saint Charles Borromeo during his many pilgrimages through Lake Maggiore, Lake Orta, the Sesia valley, the Biellese territory and Canavese. Twelve stages connect Arona with the Via Francigena in Viverone, passing by three Sacri Monti and many sanctuaries of the Verbano, Cusio and Biellese territories.  Via delle Genti  This route starts in Arona, runs along Lake Maggiore as far as Brissago, Locarno, and Bellinzona, and continues towards the Gotthard Pass, that connects the southern Swiss cantons (Valais and Ticino) with the central cantons of (Uri and Graub√ºnden).  Via Spiritualit√†  This path connects Domodossola and Baceno with the Swiss town Ernen along ancient mule tracks. From Domodossola the way goes along the Toce river through the Antigorio valley, as far as the Arbola Pass, connecting Italy and Valais, and afterwards ends up in Ernen. From Domodossola the way continues towards Verbania and the main path of CoEUR passing through Ornavasso, with its cycle paths.  Via del Mercato  This historic way starts in Domodossola and goes through the Valle Vigezzo and the Centovalli as far as Locarno. The track uses trails and mule tracks of the ancient Via del Mercato, the way on which merchants from Italy and Switzerland transported goods. In the early 20th century the Centovalli railway was built in order to develop commerce and nowadays it is a major tourist attraction. This path includes the Santuario della Madonna del Sangue in Re, destination of many pilgrimages from the neighbourhood, half way between the Ossola valley and Lake Maggiore.  The ring of Saint Charles  In the Cannobio valley there is a network of paths connecting the numerous villages in the valley associated with Charles Borromeo's visits to the Pieve of Cannobio.  The witches of Croveo  The area between Baceno and Croveo is historically connected with witchcraft trials, attested by many plaques explaining legends, popular beliefs and historic proof of the many witchcraft trials that occurred in this area in past centuries.  The UNESCO sites  The CoEUR path connects nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Two in Switzerland: * Monte San Giorgio * Three Castles of Bellinzona Seven in Italy: * Five out of nine Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy: ** Sacro Monte di Oropa ** Sacro Monte di Varallo ** Sacro Monte di Orta ** Sacro Monte di Ghiffa ** Sacro Monte di Domodossola * Two Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps: ** VI.1-Emissario by the Viverone Lake ** Mercurago by Arona  Natural reserves  Along the way there are many nature parks and natural reserves. * National park of the Locarnese territory (CH) - Waiting for law approval * Forest reserve of Palagnedra (CH) * Forest reserve of the Sacred wood of Mergugno (CH) * Bolle di Magadino Natural Reserve (CH) * Val Grande National Park * Alpe Veglia and Alpe Devero Natural Park * Alta Valle Antrona Natural Park * Fondo Toce Natural Reserve * Lagoni di Mercurago Natural Park * Monte Fenera Natural Park * Parco Burcina Natural Reserve * Bessa Natural Reserve * Sacro Monte di Varallo Natural Reserve * Sacro Monte di Orta Natural Reserve * Sacro Monte di Oropa Natural Reserve * Protected area of the Oasi Zegna * SCI of the Valsessera  See also  * Camino de Santiago * Via Francigena * UNESCO  References   External links  * official site Hiking trails in Italy Hiking trails in Switzerland ","title":"CoEur devotional path"},{"id":"46496302","text":"Pol-e Siah, or the Black Bridge, in Ahvaz, Iran, is a national heritage site.

It is an economic indicator used to measure pay equality. The gender pay gap is an official statistic published annually by Stats NZ sourced from the Household Labour Force Survey. Until 1960, separate pay rates for men and women doing the same work were legal in both the public and private sectors. Now there is legislation prohibiting sex discrimination in employment. The Government Service Equal Pay Act 1960 abolished gender-based pay scales in the public service and in 1972 this was extended to the private sector in the Equal Pay Act. The Human Rights Act (1993) and the Employment Relations Act 2000 prohibit sex discrimination in all aspects of employment, including pay. New Zealand is signatory to international agreements with the International Labour Organization and Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women that prohibit sex discrimination in employment. By international comparisons New Zealand is moderately placed on global pay equality indexes. There is a larger difference in the pay gap between men and women from MƒÅori and Pacific ethnicities than those with European ethnicities. Two main sources of New Zealand‚Äôs gender pay gap have been suggested: women are often clustered in lower paid occupations (occupational segregation) and women are under-represented in higher-level and managerial positions. As an economic indicator of gender inequality, a gender gap does not validate the claim of failure to ensure the principles of pay equality and equal pay for equal work. There is no standard international gender pay gap measure. The gender wage gap, published by the OECD, provides international comparison. It is calculated using the median hourly wage paid to full-time male and female workers. The New Zealand gender pay gap includes part-time and full-time workers to include the approximately 30 percent of women working less than 30 paid hours per week. Legislation Equal Pay Act 1972 Until 1960, separate pay rates for men and women doing the same work were legal in both the public and private sectors.Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [MBIE] \\"History of Pay and Employment Equity in New Zealand\\" Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment: Labour Information. This changed with the introduction of the Government Service Equal Pay Act 1960, which abolished gender-based pay scales in the public service.Government Service Equal Pay Act 1960, s 3(1)(a). In 1972, the Equal Pay Act (EPA) extended the principle of pay equity to the private sector. Under the EPA, if work, or a class of work, requires the same, or substantially similar, degrees of skill, effort and responsibility of its male and female employees, yet pays them different rates, that difference in pay is deemed to be gender-based, and illegal.Equal Pay Act 1972, s 3(1)(a)(i). If a class of work is exclusively or predominantly performed by females, gender-based pay inequality is deemed to exist if a different rate would be paid to male employees with the same, or similar, skills performing the work under substantially similar conditions and with substantially similar degrees of effort.Equal Pay Act 1972, s 3(1)(b). Human Rights Act 1993 The Human Rights Act 1993 (HRA) expressly prohibits discrimination on thirteen grounds, including sex.Human Rights Act 1993, s 21(1)(a). The HRA applies to all aspects of employment, including remuneration. If an employee feels that they have been unlawfully discriminated against in the course of their employment they can make a complaint to the Human Rights Review Tribunal.Human Rights Act 1993, s 94 As defined by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), sex- based employment discrimination exists when an employer refuses, or fails to offer an employee the same terms, conditions, benefits or opportunities as other employees with the same or similar qualifications, experience or skills working in the same or similar circumstances, but of the opposite gender. Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Minimum Employment Rights and Obligations (2013) at 8. Other legislation * The Employment Relations Act 2000 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex, and grants the Employment Court jurisdiction over employment disputes.Employment Relations Act 2000, s 105 * The State Sector Act 1988State Sector Act 1988, s58(3) and the Crown Entities Act 2004Crown Entities Act 2004, s 118(2)(b). impose an obligation on public sector employers to be 'good employers'. This includes an obligation to provide equal employment opportunity programmes aimed at eliminating policies and procedures that cause inequality. International obligations In addition to its domestic legal framework, New Zealand has ratified several international instruments concerned with pay equality. International Labour Organization Conventions New Zealand is a party to the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers of Equal Value (ILO 100). Art 2(1) provides:Convention concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers of Equal Value (adopted 29 June 1951, entered into force on 23 May 1953), art 2(1). New Zealand has also ratified the ILO Convention concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation (ILO 111), which provides:Convention concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation (adopted 25 June 1958, entered into force 15 June 1960), art 2. Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women New Zealand ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1985. Article 11 provides that states must take appropriate measures to eliminate employment discrimination, including ensuring the right to equal remuneration, and equal treatment for work of equal value. Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women 1249 UNTS 13 (opened for signature 18 December 1979, entered into force 3 September 1981), art 11. Other international obligations * Article 23(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that everyone, without discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. Universal Declaration of Human Rights GA Res 217A, III A/810 (1948), art 23(2). * Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights secures women‚Äôs right to conditions not inferior to those enjoyed by men, including equal pay for equal work.International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 993 UNTS 3 (opened for signature 16 December 1966, entry into force 3 January 1976), art 7.  Research  Research into the causes of the New Zealand gender pay gap finds that up to 80 percent is unexplained by measurable effects such as educational differences, occupation, age or family. Unexplained difference includes differences in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs choices and behaviours, conscious and unconscious bias. The unexplained portion of the pay gap is larger for women with higher wages. Motherhood is an important factor in New Zealand's gender pay gap. Sin et al (2018) found that women on average experience a 4.4 percent decrease in hourly wages returning to work as mothers. For mothers returning after 12 months, the average decrease is 8.3 percent.Dr Isabelle Sin, Dr Kabir Dasgupta and Professor Gail Pacheco \\"Parenthood and labour market outcomes\\" Ministry for Women (2018) Gender pay gap Although the Equal Pay Act made different pay rates illegal, New Zealand has a persistent pay gap. In 2011 the Human Rights Commission (HRC) described it as \\"a systemic and enduring inequality for women.\\"Human Rights Commission Tracking Equality at Work (June 2011) at 28. From 2000-2008 the gender pay gap consistently sat between 12 and 14%.Ministry for Women \\"Gender pay gap\\" Since 2009 it has reduced steadily, and in 2018 stood at 9.2%.Ministry for Women \\"Gender pay gap\\" Internationally, New Zealand is moderately placed on global pay equality indexes. In 2014, it was 33rd of 142 countries in the World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report rankings of wage equality for similar work.World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report 2014 (2013) at 284. In New Zealand, the gender pay gap coexists with an ethnic one. In 2011, the Human Rights Commission found that while the difference between the median hourly wage of a European male and European female was 12.4%, between a European male and a Pacific woman it was 24.4%. Human Rights Commission Tracking Equality at Work (June 2011) at 12. Several sources of New Zealand‚Äôs gender pay gap have been suggested: Occupational segregation 47% of female workers are in occupations where 80% or more of the employees are women.Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [MBIE ‚ÄúWhat is Pay and Employment Equity‚Äù] MBIE Labour Information. MBIE notes that:MBIE ‚ÄúWhat is Pay and Employment Equity‚Äù MBIE Labour Information. \\"Women are often clustered in a narrow range of occupations‚Ä¶ The skills and knowledge that women bring to the work in female-dominated occupations may not be recognised and therefore not valued appropriately in comparison to other jobs.\\" A 2011 report by Goldman Sachs noted that female-dominated areas tend to be social services oriented, meaning that employee outputs are more difficult to measure.Philip Borkin, Closing the Gender Gap: Plenty of Potential Economic Upside (Goldman Sachs, 9 August 2011) at 1. This creates a risk of systemic undervaluation. The risk of undervaluation posed by occupational segregation was recognised by the UN Human Rights Council Working Group in the 2009 and 2014 Universal Periodic Review of New Zealand. The 2014 Review included recommendations that New Zealand review its equal pay legislation, with a focus on addressing the issue of systemic undervaluation of women‚Äôs work, and minimizing the link between the pay gap and ethnicity. United Nations Human Rights Council Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review Draft report of the Working Group on the Periodic Review: New Zealand XVIII A/HRC/WG.6/18/L.1 at 128.39, 128.99. =Cases concerning occupational segregation= Clerical Administrative v Farmers Trading In 1986, the New Zealand Clerical Workers Union brought a case under the Equal Pay Act arguing that the wages being paid to clerical workers were lower than those being paid for work of equal value, such as that of builders, and that this difference existed because over 90% of clerks were female, whereas the majority of builders were male.New Zealand Clerical Administrative etc IAOW v Farmers Trading Co Ltd [Farmers Trading] [1986] ACJ 203 at 6. The application was rejected on the basis that the EPA was limited to ensuring equal pay between male and female employees within the same sector.Farmers Trading [1986] ACJ 203 at 207. Comparison across sectors for the purpose of identifying systemic undervaluation was deemed to fall outside the scope of the EPA. In response to the case, the Department of Labour commissioned a study on wage equality. It concluded that there was still a substantial gender pay gap in New Zealand, and that occupational segregation was one of its main sources.PJ Hyman and A Clark Equal Pay Stud Phase One Report (Department of Labour, 1987). The report led to the enactment of the Employment Equity Act 1990, which contained provisions on both pay equity and equal opportunity. However, after a change in government from the Labour Party to the National Party in the 1990 New Zealand election, the Employment Equity Act was repealed. The ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has criticised Farmers Trading, saying that its interpretation of the EPA failed to give legislative effect to the principle of equal remuneration.International Labour Organization Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations Observation: Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No 100) ‚Äì New Zealand (2012). Terranova Homes & Care Limited v Service and Food Workers Union Nga Ringa Tota Incorporated Terranova v Bartlett Ms Bartlett was a caregiver at a rest home, an occupation in which 92% of workers are female. She claimed that even though she was paid the same wage as her male colleagues, both her and their pay rate was artificially low because of the predominance of female workers in the caregiving sector.Terranova Homes & Care Limited v Service and Food Workers Union Nga Ringa Tota Incorporated [Terranova] [2014] NZCA 516 at [6]. Reversing the decision in Farmers Trading, the Court of Appeal of New Zealand held that wage comparisons between female and male-dominated sectors can be made under the Equal Pay Act in order to determine whether systematic undervaluation is occurring in female-dominated occupations.[Terranova] [2014] NZCA 516 at [147]. The Court stated:Terranova Homes [2014] NZCA 516 at [108].\\"A rate of pay that is depressed because of sex-based undervaluation of the work is not a rate in which there is no element of sex-based differentiation.\\" The case has been received as a positive development in human rights and employment law. Employment lawyer John Goddard states that the EPA was widely considered to be inadequate for ensuring true pay equality, but that in light of Terranova this must now be reconsidered.John Goddard ‚ÄúEqual Pay Act Claims: A New Conversation‚Äù (2013) ELB 111 at 113. Lorraine Skiffington said the case is ‚Äúthe first significant step towards realizing the social justice that was envisaged by the architects of the [Equal Pay] Act‚Ä¶ It decisively deals with the narrow ‚Äòself-defeating‚Äô comparisons that have perpetuated pay and employment inequalities in the past.‚ÄùLorraine Skiffington ‚ÄúHeralding a New Era of Pay Equity‚Äù (2013) ELB 123 at 125. Equal opportunities for women The under-representation of women in higher-level and managerial positions is also given as a reason for the gender pay gap. In the public sector, women make up 59% of the workforce but only 24% of the chief executives.Human Rights Commission New Zealand Census of Women‚Äôs Participation (2012) at 4. In the private sector, the Human Rights Commission found in 2012 that among the top 100 companies listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange, only three have female chief executives.Human Rights Commission Zealand Census of Women‚Äôs Participation (2012) at 2. The New Zealand Law Society states that while 46.3% of practicing certificates held by lawyers in law firms in 2013 were held by women, only 19.8% of partners or directors in those firms were women.New Zealand Law Society ‚ÄúWomen in the Legal Profession: By the numbers‚Äù. Possible reform In 2011, the HRC issued its report Tracking Equality at Work, containing a draft replacement of the EPA called the Pay Equality Bill.Human Rights Commission Tracking Equality at Work (June 2011) at 36. Unlike the EPA, the Pay Equality Bill shifts the onus of proving pay equality from the employee to employer. Instead of requiring a finding of pay discrimination, the Pay Equality Bill establishes a positive right to pay equality which must be satisfied by employers. As at April 2015, the Pay Equality Bill had not yet been considered for enactment. In September 2019, Westpac New Zealand voluntarily disclosed its 30.3% gender pay gap and aimed for equal men and women in management roles. In December 2018 the Minister for Women announced a flexible work scheme in New Zealand to reduce the gender pay gap which is supposed to be implemented by the end of 2020. In June 2019 the NZ Statistics published the gender pay gap figure as 9.2%, and now more corporate companies are applying for the New Zealand Based Accreditation Gender Tick. Gender Tick is an initiative from the YWCA and to earn the accreditation companies must have a safe and inclusive culture, flexible working arrangements and equal pay.

It was released worldwide in March 2015, while the Steam port was released in August 2015. Type-0 HD is a high-definition remaster of the Japan-exclusive PlayStation Portable game Final Fantasy Type-0, a spin-off from the main Final Fantasy series and part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, a set of games sharing a common mythos. The story focuses on Class Zero, a group of fourteen students from the Dominion of Rubrum who must fight the neighboring Militesi Empire when they launch an assault on the other Crystal States of Orience. In doing so, the group become entangled in both the efforts to push back and defeat the forces of Militesi, and the secret behind the war and the existence of the crystals. After Type-0 received a 2011 Japan-only release on PSP, Type-0 HD began development in mid-2012 as part of a move to promote the next generation of gaming consoles, and gave the opportunity for multiple changes to refine the experience for players. Outside of updated graphics and an expanded color palette, Type-0 HD is largely identical to the original PSP version, although the original's multiplayer functionality was dropped, and additional difficulty levels were implemented. Type-0 HD reached high positions in international sales charts, and has sold over one million copies worldwide as of October 2015. It received praise for its story and battle system, while criticisms have focused on its HD upgrade and localization. Gameplay Screenshot of combat in Final Fantasy Type-0 HD, showing characters Ace, Queen and Nine in combat with human enemies and a mech. Final Fantasy Type-0 HD is an action role-playing video game that utilizes a real-time battle system similar to Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. The player controls Class Zero, an elite fighting force of fourteen students from Rubrum's Akademeia. Outside mission environments and Akademeia (Class Zero's home base), Class Zero navigates Orience through a scaled-down world map. The world can be navigated on foot, using chocobos (recurring galliform birds in the Final Fantasy series) or via an airship. Type-0 HD is split into missions with free periods in between. During these free periods between missions, players can explore Akademeia, breed chocobos for personal use, and complete side quests for characters in Akademeia and liberated towns. During missions, three members of Class Zero can be selected for missions while the others are kept in reserve in case a player character dies. The lead character can be swapped at any time, with the other two being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. During certain story missions, players take part in real-time strategy battles on the world map. During combat missions, players gain experience points and increase their experience level as they defeat enemies, as well as obtaining Phantoma from defeated enemies, used to upgrade the characters' magic skills. Each character has access to summoned monsters called Eidolons ( in the original Japanese), which are summoned for limited periods at the cost of a character's total health. While the core gameplay remains the same, multiple adjustments were made to existing systems. The HD version features four difficulty levels as opposed to the original's three, including an \\"easy\\" option. The original game's multiplayer elements were removed during optimization for consoles, and types of magic and accessories previously only available in multiplayer were incorporated into the single-player campaign. A feature unique to Type-0 HD is the support personnel (SP) system: when activated, AI-controlled support characters take the place of normal party members. SP points earned in battle can be used to purchase special items. Additional character costumes made included through the original's demos and downloadable content were included in Type-0 HD as unlockables, along with costumes unique to the HD version. Development During the production of Final Fantasy Type-0, the development team explored the possibility of a high-definition port of the game. The idea never went beyond experimentation as the team was focused on keeping the game as a portable experience. The team also experimented with a sequel on eighth generation consoles, but production was halted when the development team were transferred to Final Fantasy XV. After some time working on XV, original director Hajime Tabata decided to develop Type-0 HD for eighth-generation consoles. The game began development in mid-2012, around the same time XV was shifted onto PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Xbox One. Tabata came on board in July of that year as director and producer, though his involvement was fairly minor due to his directing duties for XV. The main development was handled by HexaDrive, who had previously collaborated successfully with Square Enix on The 3rd Birthday, and had developed the high-definition remasters of ≈åkami and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. The remaster was intended as an incentive for Final Fantasy players in both Japan and the west to purchase eighth generation consoles before XVs release. The original plan was for a port to both the seventh generation PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, and eighth generation consoles. After the PS4 proved popular at the 2013 Tokyo Game Show, and as Tabata had no development experience with seventh generation console hardware, the team focused on the eighth generation versions. According to art director Yusuke Naora, moving from the PlayStation Portable to eighth- generation hardware proved hard for the team. Despite early claims, no version of Type-0 HD was developed for the PlayStation Vita. According to Tabata, this was due to difficulties in porting between console and Vita development environments, and his wish for a playing experience he could only envision on home consoles. HexaDrive handled the 2D screen displays, world map features and lip synching, while Square Enix handled the 3D graphics, such as character models in cutscenes. Lighting effects and in-game assets were improved and updated for HD consoles using the DirectX 11 technology utilized for XV. Alongside this, a large proportion of the upgrade was done using HexaDrive's in-house engine HexaDrive Engine 2.0. While originally meant to have a cursory role compared to the DirectX 11 elements, it ended up being used far more than anticipated. The resolution was increased from the original game's 480x272 pixels to the 1920x1080 required. Despite all these changes, the team took care that the lighting and shadow effects remained faithful to the look of the original, as updating too much of the game's visual style would fundamentally alter the experience. Due to scheduling, there was sometimes pressure on the HexaDrive team and they experienced difficulties with the hardware as it was their first time developing for eighth-generation consoles. Updating the lighting effects alone took a whole year of development to finish. While updating the characters' appearance, the team were forced to focus on the main characters due to production deadlines, consequently doing less work on NPCs such as Kurasame. For the main characters' gameplay models, the team adapted the models used in the original cutscenes, as they were more detailed than the original gameplay models due to a higher polygon count. Tabata wanted the main characters to remain as true as possible to their original appearances, but due to the cutscene models appearing older than the original gameplay models, they needed adjusting so they better reflected the original models. The team also adjusted the characters' appearances slightly to make them more \\"charming\\". Visual optimization was still going on during the game's reveal, with the team needing to create special screenshots of Type-0s characters operating inside the production environments of XV. Ultimately, these visuals gave the team a guide for what the final game should look like, reducing the amount of trial and error. No new gameplay content was added to Type-0 HD. The team instead focused on upgrading the graphics, adjusting existing gameplay for home consoles, and including a lower difficulty level. The latter was due to complaints from players that the original game was too difficult. While carrying over the original's multiplayer functions was considered, it would have lengthened the estimated development time by another year. Since Tabata's priority was to bring the game to fans worldwide, the multiplayer and associated elements were either removed or incorporated into the single-player campaign. Tabata also decided against creation of a demo or an international version for this reason. As a substitute for the multiplayer, the team strengthened and improved the original single-player Academy Assistance function. As with the original, the team used the names of developers from both the core team and other Square Enix departments for the NPCs. While the main story remained unchanged, a secret cutscene teasing future Type games was commissioned. Created by Square Enix's CGI movie subsidiary Visual Works, it was based on some of Tabata's early ideas for Type-0. A small piece of the cutscene was shown privately to attendees of Square Enix's 25th anniversary commemoration event for the Final Fantasy series. Hiroki Chiba, writer for Type-0, returned to write the scene. In the cutscene, a fatally wounded samurai warrior resembling main protagonist Ace is saved from death by a fire spirit. At Tabata's suggestion, Naora expanded the color palette to increase the game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds were added to the sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging. Music The original soundtrack for Type-0 by Takeharu Ishimoto, who also composed the music for Before Crisis, Crisis Core and The World Ends with You. Ishimoto rearranged, remixed and re-recorded the soundtrack for Type-0 HD. This was due to the original soundtrack was composed within the limits of PSP hardware, making it unsuitable for the new console release. Because of a restricted budget, he did the bulk of the work himself. One of the changes he made was making the choral sound more prominent. In addition, he composed a new battle theme and recorded an English version of \\"Colorful - Falling in Love\\", the track for Type-0s alternate ending. The lyrics were translated by SAWA, a singer who had worked on The World Ends with You. The English version was made for the overseas version of the game, but was included in the remastered soundtrack's commercial release. Type-0s original theme song, \\"Zero\\" by Japanese rock band Bump of Chicken, was used again for Type-0 HD. While a translated version was considered for the localization, the team, with permission from the band, decided to use the original song and add subtitles for the song lyrics. For the additional ending and credits of Type-0 HD, a new song titled was commissioned by Tabata. Ishimoto created five different songs, with \\"Utakata\\" being Tabata's final choice. As Tabata wanted the song to have a Japanese style, Ishimoto wrote the lyrics in archaic Japanese, though he originally wanted to write the lyrics in English. It was created and recorded by a four-person team: Ishimoto composed the music, while singer Chris Ito wrote and sang the lyrics. The other two, T$UYO$HI and ZAX, were former members of alternate rock band Pay Money to My Pain and performed on bass guitar, and drums respectively. The song was first heard in the final Japanese trailer for Type-0 HD. A commercial Blu-ray release for Type-0 HDs soundtrack, Final Fantasy Type-0 HD Original Soundtrack, was released on March 25, 2015. It includes the entire soundtrack, the newly composed tracks, tracks from Final Fantasy Agito and ten bonus MP3 tracks selected by Ishimoto from his previous work as a \\"Best of Collection\\". The Blu-ray album reached #189 in the Oricon charts, and remained in the charts for one week. The album, and music in general, have received positive comments from music critics and reviewers of the game. Release Type-0 HD was released on March 17, 19 and 20, 2015 for North America, Japan and Europe respectively. It came with both English and Japanese voice tracks for all regions. The game included a demo of Final Fantasy XV, titled Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae. The demo was only available in limited quantities: it was exclusive to physical first-print editions, and came with the digital edition for two months after release. The collector's edition, available through Square Enix's online store and at Amazon.com, came with a special CD featuring tracks from Type-0 and Agito, a calendar featuring official artwork, a Vermillion Peristylium ID card, a set of five cards modeled after those used by Ace in battle, and a cadet scarf. Limited editions of the game were produced for North America and Europe, for sale at selected high street and online stores. A PlayStation 4 hardware bundle was also produced for Japan, featuring a copy of the game and download code for the XV demo along with a console themed after the game. A port to Microsoft Windows via Valve's Steam platform was developed. This port was created in response to fan demands for a PC version. In contrast to the console version, the PC port allowed graphic adjustments, and included fixes for camera control and motion blur issues raised by players and reviewers after release. The port was released on August 18, 2015. As part of the promotion for the port, Final Fantasy-themed pre- order gifts for use in Dota 2 were created. It was the first Final Fantasy title to be rated M for Mature by the Entertainment Software Rating Board for its North American release. For the western release, a collector's edition similar to that released in Japan was created, which included the card replicas and soundtrack selection. In addition, it included an English translation of the game's prequel manga, a steelbook holding the game disc and soundtrack selection featuring the logo and kanji artwork, and an 80-page artbook with a foreword written by Tabata. The winners of a separate special sweepstake received a themed PS4 or Xbox One, along with promotional artwork posters specific to each console, a Play Arts Kai mini-figurine of Ace, and a gold Vermillion Bird pin. Runners-up received individual pieces from the sweepstake excluding the consoles. To promote Type-0 HD in North America, a trailer for the game was shown in cinemas prior to some of the season's big film releases, such as The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 1. A shortened version of the trailer was released online. To further promote the game upon release, Square Enix offered the Japanese thriller Battle Royale as a free rental for Xbox One in the weekend following the game's release. After its initial release, a patch was released to fix issues similar to those fixed in the PC port. At release, the PC version suffered from graphics problems, crashes, and had its graphics locked. Localization An international version was reported to be in the works by Tabata in the Ultimania guide for Type-0. He later commented that the main reasons for the original version not coming west was the flagging PSP market and the uncertainty of the Vita, making a port impractical. The name Type-0 was originally trademarked by Square Enix in Europe on December 29, 2010, along with a logo. In an interview with GameSpot in November 2012, Tabata stated that Square Enix was \\"taking a clean slate in terms of [their] plans.\\", stating that if there was demand, a western release would be considered. In the same month, an alleged voice actor for the game said that English voice recording for the game was completed in late 2011. In 2014, Orion Acaba, the English voice actor for Nine, revealed that the voice recording eventually used in Type-0 HD was completed in 2012. According to another English voice actor, Cristina Vee, the game was codenamed Yellow P during the recording process. During an interview with USGamer in September 2013, Tabata, commenting on both Type-0 and its prequel Agito, was hopeful for a western release: he said that the planned western release of Agito and the reaction of the fan community to both games had become a deciding factor, and that while the project had not been officially green-lit, it was in its final stages of preparation. He also clarified at the time that the game would not make the transition onto mobile devices or the PS3 as an HD Remaster. A localization was officially decided upon in early 2014, when a survey taken by Square Enix Europe found that a large number of fans wanted the game to be released overseas. The localization was announced when Type-0 HD was officially announced by Square Enix at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. An official English version for the Vita was momentarily announced by the official \\"PlayStation Blog\\", but was clarified as \\"erroneous\\" less than an hour later. Reception Critical reception IGN's Meghan Sullivan found the portrayal of the cadets' involvement in the war \\"incredibly moving\\" and was intrigued by the story's focus on war, but found the need to understand Orience's lore and mythology made the ending convoluted. Becky Cunningham of GamesRadar was fascinated by the game's setting and the questions it posed about morality and memory, finding the story worth experiencing. Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for GameSpot, generally enjoyed the story despite noting the main plot becoming complicated quickly, but stated that the ending introduced too many new story elements for comfort. Michael Damiani of GameTrailers found the overall story enjoyable, but gaps in story and character development, along with the need to replay the game to get the full story, \\"[leaves] you full of questions and doubt from beginning to end.\\" Eurogamer's Chris Schilling was similarly critical of the need to understand terms unfamiliar to series newcomers. He also disliked the length of cutscenes, and the jarring change from grim imagery to lighter subjects like chocobo breeding. Tom Sykes of Official Xbox Magazine said that the setting and story's superficial similarities to the later Harry Potter books improved the story after the confusing opening. Game Informers Matt Miller stated that the story started strongly, but was made less enjoyable when it began focusing on the game's overarching narrative and said the abundance of characters had a negative impact on their characterization. RPGFan's Stephen Meyerink, despite saying the game had \\"goofy faces and silly moments\\", found the story and themes engaging. Samuel Roberts of PC Gamer was less positive, feeling that the story and characters reminded him too much of poor-quality anime series. Sullivan generally enjoyed the combat, saying she \\"felt powerful because the combat was always super fast paced.\\" and calling it the game's best feature, while finding the real-time strategy segments an unpleasant hangover from the game's original form. Cunningham found it enjoyable mastering each of Class Zero's fighting styles despite difficulty spikes, but noted some gameplay elements such as stopping to use certain items detracted from her enjoyment of combat. Famitsu echoed many of its points of praise for the original, generally saying that both veterans of the original and newcomers would finding it \\"equally enjoyable\\", and were pleased with the change from a portable platform to home consoles. Sykes said the game \\"excels in its combat, which is fast-paced, complex, and tough.\\" Damiani found the battles \\"a welcomed change\\" compared to previous Final Fantasy titles, he disliked other aspects such as the lock-on mechanic. Miller enjoyed exploring the characters' battle abilities, but found the high-speed detracted from the experience and considered the real-time strategy elements, boss fights and other systems poorly developed. Schilling also found the combat mechanics \\"sharp and satisfying\\", generally praising the combat mechanics. He was critical of the lengthy tutorials at the beginning of the game, and disappointed that the gameplay segments between missions did not impact the characters' combat ability as in the Persona series. Meyerink generally enjoyed the combat and various side activities, while faulting the game for inadequate introduction of gameplay elements. Corriea called the combat \\"marvellous\\", saying it handled it and the customization options better than many other games in its genre. Roberts enjoyed the combat, but found the RPG gameplay outside it to be far weaker. The limited optional gameplay segments between combat segments, offering opportunities for character development and side-quests, were also generally praised. A point of criticism shared by western reviewers with the original version was the camera control. Famitsu, in contrast, again praised the camera movement. Corriea was mixed about the game's HD upgrade, stating that while the background were \\"gorgeous\\" and the main characters moved fluidly and expressed emotion properly, NPCs or characters unimportant to the stories did not receive the same attention as the main cast. Schilling was disappointed with the result, frequently citing scenery and character behavior that looked out of place on the big screen. Miller said that the game's visuals were \\"dominated by muddy textures and frequent loading.\\", while he negatively noted the removal of the original's multiplayer. Damiani praised the upgrades for the main characters, but noted multiple inconsistencies in both the environments and cutscenes. Famitsu found the graphics \\"dramatically beautiful\\", but found it strange seeing the original environments on a large screen. Meyerink said that, while not hard on the eyes, the upgrades were well below what he expected. Sullivan praised the lighting and shading effects, but shared Corriea's criticism of NPCs and noted low-quality environmental textures, saying she was \\"so bored by most environments that [she] stopped caring about them halfway through the story.\\" The localized dialogue also received mixed to negative reactions, with multiple reviewers faulting the English voice actors' performances. Opinions on the PC port were mixed: Meyerink marked it as an improvement of the ports of the XIII games while acknowledging issues with the graphics and controls, while Roberts was not impressed by its performance. Sales In Japan, Type-0 HD reached the top of the sales charts in its debut week, selling 93,000: the PS4 version accounted for roughly 92,000, while the Xbox One version sold roughly 1,000. Type-0 HD, together with Resident Evil: Revelations 2, provoked a rise in sales for the PS4 while other console sales remained consistent, but it ultimately performed poorly, selling through only 59.59% of its shipment. It had sold over 128,000 units in Japan by August 2015, being the 26th best-selling video game during that period. In Western territories, demand was notably higher due to the original version not being released outside Japan. In the UK, Type-0 HD reached second place in the gaming charts behind Battlefield Hardline, while it reached tenth place in the North American charts for March. As of October 2015, Type-0 HD had sold over one million copies worldwide, making a solid contribution to Square Enix's fiscal income for the year and the company's catalog of eighth-generation console games.

The project will extend the Metro North West Line from on the North Shore, to in the city's south-west via the Sydney central business district. The centrepiece of the project is a new twin- tunnel rail crossing under Sydney Harbour and through the city to . Together with planned improvements to the Main Western line, the project is expected to increase capacity on the Sydney rail network by up to 60%, and allow for the movement of over 100,000 extra commuters across the network every hour. The project began construction in 2017 and is planned to open by 2024. Tunnelling was completed in March 2020. It is estimated to cost up to $15.5 billion as a result of a budget blowout. Project History Excavation of the Marrickville dive in August 2018 In 2013, a proposal was raised to extend the then-proposed North West Rail Link, by building a metro-style tunnel from just south of Chatswood Station via St Leonards and North Sydney and under the Sydney Harbour towards Central and Redfern, before joining the newly converted metro lines towards Hurstville, Bankstown, Lidcombe and Liverpool. This largely renews a previous proposal known as the CBD Rail Link (see below), except with metro-style trains instead. The Hurstville extension was subsequently dropped. The proposal was officially announced by the New South Wales government on 10 June 2014. The proposal was contingent on funding from privatising at least 49% of the state's power infrastructure, which was secured in June 2015. Preliminary works involving drilling to depths 70m below Sydney Harbour commenced on 9 April 2015 to find the alignment for the new Sydney Metro tunnels.Getting down to business: Early work begins on Sydney Rapid Transit Transport for NSW 8 April 2015  Chatswood to Sydenham section  Planning approval for the Chatswood to Sydenham section of the project was received in January 2017. In June 2017, a John Holland, CPB Contractors and Ghella joint venture was awarded the contract to build the twin tunnels from Chatswood to Sydenham.Contract awarded for Harbour Metro crossing Infrastructure Magazine 23 June 2017 A contract for a major upgrade of Central station was awarded to Laing O'Rourke in March 2018. The project includes construction of two new underground platforms to serve the metro and a new underground concourse called Central Walk. The new platforms will be built beneath platforms 13-14. Tunnelling commenced in October 2018. In November 2018 a $1.376 billion contract was awarded to an unincorporated joint venture between CPB Contractors and UGL to be known as Systems Connect, which will include the laying of track from Chatswood to Sydenham as well as converting power on the Bankstown line to Metro standards and also the building of further Metro train facilities at Rouse Hill and Marrickville.Metro on track as $1.376 billion contract awarded Transport for NSW  Sydenham to Bankstown section  The incorporation of Sydenham to Bankstown into Sydney Metro has not been without controversy, with a letter written by four former rail executives John Brew, Ron Christie, Bob O‚ÄôLoughlin and Dick Day casting doubts on the government's claims of improved reliability as well as warning that commuters west of Bankstown face additional interchange for travel towards the City Circle. Planning approval of the upgrade of Bankstown Line between Sydenham and Bankstown was received in December 2018. Beginning in December 2019, the Bankstown Line between and and the Illawarra Line between and was closed during certain periods in order to allow the Bankstown line to be converted and upgraded to metro standards.Sydenham to Bankstown Preferred Infrastructure Report Overview Sydney Metro June 2018 The NSW Legislative Council announced on 22 August 2019 an Inquiry into the \\"Sydenham - Bankstown Line conversion\\" examining decision making in relation to the transport project. The Inquiry to be conducted by Portfolio Committee 6 - Transport and Customer Service and chaired by Abigail Boyd released its report on 9 April 2020, recommending that the conversion not take place with Sydney Metro instead to terminate at Sydenham. Route The project is a major extension of the Metro North West Line, connecting Chatswood-the line's current terminus-to Sydenham, with new stations at Crows Nest, Victoria Cross, Barangaroo, Martin Place, Pitt Street, Central and Waterloo. At Sydenham, the line would join the existing Bankstown railway line, which will be converted to rapid transit standards between Sydenham and Bankstown as part of the Sydney Metro City & Southwest project. The original list of stations consisted of Crows Nest, Victoria Cross, Martin Place, , Central, Sydenham and the stations of the Bankstown line. Potential additional stations were also proposed for the industrial area of Artarmon (underground), St Leonards, Barangaroo and either the University of Sydney or Waterloo. Barangaroo station was confirmed in June 2015 and Waterloo was confirmed in December.Budget delivers $9 billion for public transport services and infrastructure Transport for NSW 23 June 2015 The other three stations will not be included in the project. The remaining stations served by the T3 Bankstown Line (Erskineville, St Peters and 9 stations west of Bankstown towards Lidcombe / Cabramatta) will continue to be served by Sydney Trains. Transport for NSW commenced planning for rail services west of Bankstown in 2020. Potential extension A scoping study into rail investment to service Western Sydney and the proposed Western Sydney Airport was announced by the New South Wales and Australian governments in November 2015. The study's final report was released in March 2018 and included a proposal to extend the Sydney Metro City & Southwest from Bankstown to Liverpool. The extension is unlikely to be built for at least 20 years. Previous proposals CBD Rail Link The CBD Rail Link was a component of the now- cancelled Metropolitan Rail Expansion Program (MREP) in Sydney. First announced in 2005, the line was to have started at Redfern Station, travelled under the city centre, crossed under Sydney Harbour, passed through the lower North Shore and ended at the existing Chatswood railway station. It was to have provided the centre section of a planned North West-CBD-South West rail arc connecting major areas of employment with the CBD and airport. Alternative names for the planned route have included the Redfern to Chatswood Rail Link (RCRL), Redfern to Chatswood Harbour Rail Link and MetroPitt. The proposal was announced by Labor Premier Bob Carr on 15 June 2005 (shortly before his resignation), and formed part of the $8 billion Metropolitan Rail Expansion Project (MREP). The MREP consisted of the New South Wales government's $8 billion North West - CBD - South West line, including the North West Rail Link (to extend from Cheltenham to Rouse Hill), and the spur to Leppington in Sydney's South West. The six kilometre CBD Rail Link was slated to cost $5 billion, and was to include duplicated tracks on the North Shore line between St Leonards and Chatswood. It was to provide a second railway line transversing Sydney Harbour to ease congestion at Town Hall and Wynyard stations, both considerably crowded and unable to be easily expanded, and to reduce travel times between the city and the lower North Shore. The government's previous plan of constructing an additional CBD underground line was known as MetroWest. It was to have run from Haymarket in the city's Chinatown precinct near Darling Harbour, along the western edge of the city under Sussex or Kent Street and either ended at Wynyard station or continued over the harbour 'strapped' to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. This option would not have served the part of the city experiencing the fastest growth of employment, and would have necessitated the destruction of eight office buildings. A previous MetroPitt proposal, travelling further east (and under its namesake Pitt Street) and through the financial district, could also be built deeper underground, limiting the impact on existing infrastructure. In 2006, both of these corridors were protected with planning buffers to allow the option of future construction. Developers who want to excavate deeper than two metres within a 25-metre buffer zone of the corridors need to seek RailCorp's approval. In the plan the stations along the CBD Rail Link would have included: * Redfern - connecting to the metro lines to Hurstville, Bankstown and Liverpool * Central - interchanging with all lines through the CBD then * Pitt Street * Martin Place - interchanging with the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line * Circular Quay - interchanging with the Bankstown, Inner West, South & Airport/East Hills Lines * Victoria Cross * Crows Nest * St Leonards - interchanging with the North Shore and Northern Lines * Chatswood - interchanging with the North Shore and Northern Lines A map of the protected corridors suggested there may have been the potential for another station at Macquarie Place, between The Rocks and Castlereagh Street. In March 2008 the State Government announced that the line would be cancelled, its role to be partly superseded by future metro rail lines.Besser L and Smith A. City catches fast-tracked metro. Sydney Morning Herald, 19 March 2008. Later Labor proposals One of the metro lines announced in 2009 by the Rees state government was CBD Metro, which ran along a similar CBD alignment to the current Sydney Metro proposal between Central and Barangaroo. However, no metro lines linking the CBD to Chatswood were announced. In 2010, the entire metro project was cancelled, and the CBD Relief Line & Western Express concept was announced as replacement. The relief line was largely a return to the CBD Rail Link proposal, but used the MetroWest alignment instead. The line would have offered an alternative heavy rail link in the CBD between Redfern and Wynyard, but also did not cross the harbour into the North Shore. The relief line was cancelled by the incoming Liberal-Nationals government when they won the 2011 state election, who then announced the current project in 2014.

She was one of 6 people to be awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2015. She is known for organizing protests against a lead smelting plant located in the middle of Owino Uhuru, a slum near Mombasa. The plant was causing lead poisoning by raising the lead content in the environment, killing residents, in particular children, and harming others, including her own child. The plant was ultimately closed. She is the founder of the Centre for Justice, Governance and Environmental Action (CJGEA). Personal life Phyllis Omido was born in Kidinye Village, Vihiga County, to Margaret Omido and Alfred Omido. She has two brothers and a sister. Her eldest brother is George Mukutu. Omido's sister is named Susan Monyani Kasuki. Her youngest brother is Silas Enane. Omido was never married and has one child named Kingdavid Jeremiah Indiatsi. She studied Business Administration at the University of Nairobi and worked in industries in Kenya for more than 15 years. Activism Organization against the smelting plant The plant started operations in 2009 in Owino Uhuru. It salvaged the lead from old car batteries. The result of the process was lead fumes which were released into the environment. Also, acid wastewater was not treated and was released into streams used by residents to bathe. While working there as a community liaison officer, Omido commissioned an environmental impact assessment (EIA). The findings showed that the plant was releasing lead into the environment. As community relations officer, she made a recommendation that the smelter close and reopen elsewhere. Her superiors disagreed and reassigned her, bringing in a different consultant to finish the EIA. Shortly after she started working at the smelter, Omido's baby became ill. She rushed him to hospital. They initially thought it was typhoid or malaria, but it was determined to be lead poisoning. She concluded that it must have been from the smelter. She selected three, random children and gave them blood tests. Each had levels of lead that were above the safe level according to the standards set by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She then quit her job and began her campaign to close the plant. In 2012, Omido, along with her son, was accosted by armed men outside her home but managed to escape. After getting no results from company leaders and government officials to close the plant, she organized a demonstration. She was arrested along with 16 other members of CJGEA while lobbying against toxic waste. The CJGEA offices were raided and police confiscated documents and computers. After spending a night in jail, she was charged with \\"inciting violence\\" and illegal gathering. After a lengthy court battle, a judge dismissed the case under section 210. The magistrate stated that she had acted within the law. She then started to get help from Human Rights Watch and other groups. She met with the United Nations Special Rapporteur on toxic waste. This prompted the Kenyan Senate to come to the plant to assess the claims. The plant was finally closed in January 2014. Centre for Justice, Governance and Environmental Action In 2009, Omido founded The Centre for Justice, Governance and Environmental Action (CJGEA). Registered in Kilifi County and based in Mombasa, the organization was established to address environmental issues faced by the settlements near Kenya's industrial areas. In doing so, CJGEA has also become involved in addressing other issues, such as governance, policy change, and human rights. Programmes that the organization provides are climate change and environmental governance, activism and human rights, legal aid, and education. CJGEA partnered with Human Rights Watch in the creation of a film on the poisoning of communities with toxic materials. It will focus on the death and health issues, as well as impunity and disregard for the environment and rule of law committed by the offenders. The film was launched on June 24, 2014 to coincide with the first UN Assembly on environment held in Nairobi. Recent work In February 2013, representing CJGEA, Omido attended a United Nations Environment Programme consultation forum on human rights and the environment, sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program. In 2013 Omido represented Kenya's HRDs at Risk in Dublin, Ireland. In 2014 she went to Geneva, Switzerland to attend the Universal Rights Group Consultative Forum for Environmental Human Rights Defenders. From September 5 to 7, 2014, she attended the 3rd United Nations Institute for Training and Research-Yale Conference on Environmental Governance and Democracy at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. On September 23, 2014, she was present at KIOS, the Finnish international human rights seminar. She continues lobbying government. In 2014, three toxic waste smelters in poor, urban settlements were relocated to other parts of Mombasa. Goldman Environmental Prize Omido was one of six recipients of the 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize. The award is the largest in the world for grassroots activists whose cause is the environment. She received a trophy along with prize money of US$175,000 or 5.7 million Kenya Shillings.

In popular culture, the collection and writing of Shahnama is attributed to the Kurdish poet Sarhang Almas Khan in the eighteenth century, but in reality many writers have gathered and written down the text of Shahnama in different locations and times. In fact, older and more recent manuscripts of the Kurdish Shahnameh are available. There are several differences between the Kurdish Shahnameh and Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, notably the poems of the former are written in Kurdish rather than Persian and there are several characters that are not mentioned in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh. Furthermore, the meter of Kurdish Shahnama is syllabic, which is more common in the Kurdish literature. Shahram Nazeri has sung several verses of the Kurdish Shahnameh in Avaze Asatir.

Her work with the article and Lewkowicz's overall work covering domestic violence won her the Ville de Perpignan R√©mi Ochlik Award in 2013. Lewkowicz has attended Ohio University, where she completed a master's degree in Visual Communication. Photographer as Witness On February 27, 2013, Lewkowicz published \\"Photographer as Witness\\", which had originally been published on the photography website fotovisura as ‚ÄúMaggie and Shane‚Äù. The article showed photographs of Shane, a 31-year-old ex-convict abusing his 19-year-old girlfriend Maggie, and was accompanied by an essay by Lewkowicz. In the essay Lewkowicz described how her initial purpose for photographing the couple was to \\"paint a portrait of the catch-22 of being a released ex-convict: even though they are physically free, the metaphorical prison of stigma doesn‚Äôt allow them to truly escape.\\" However, during one of her visits Shane and Maggie began fighting over a woman that had flirted with Shane at a bar they had just left. Once they returned home and entered the house's kitchen, the two continued to fight and Shane escalated the dispute and attacked Maggie in view of her daughter Memphis, who had heard the altercation. Lewkowicz photographed the events, pausing at one point to ensure that the police had been called. Shane was arrested for his actions and Maggie has since left Shane. After the photos were published in Time Lewkowicz began receiving criticism from Internet users, who questioned why she continued to photograph while the physical violence was still ongoing. Lewkowicz responded to the criticism by stating \\"The incident raised a number of ethical questions. I‚Äôve been castigated by a number of anonymous internet commenters who have said that I should have somehow physically intervened between the two. Their criticism counters what actual law enforcement officers have told me ‚Äî that physically intervening would have likely only made the situation worse, endangering me, and further endangering Maggie.\\" The photographs have since won several awards, including the 2014 L'Iris d'Or Award.

Sunrise Candles is a candle making company run majorly by visually disabled people. Bhavesh has been participating in paralympic category of games and has won 117 NAB, IBSA medals. Early life Bhavesh was born with retina macular degeneration and had little sight while he was growing up. His mother was suffering from cancer and later succumbed to her illness. His father was a caretaker at a guesthouse in Mahabaleshwar. Before Bhavesh lost his sight completely, he worked as a telephone operator at a Hotel in Mahabaleshwar, Maharashtra though few say that he worked as a telephone operator in a hotel. At the age of 23, Bhavesh lost his eye sight and consequently, lost his job as well. Struggle After losing his sight completely, Dr.Bhavesh Bhatia joined National Association For the Blind (NAB) and took training in candle making. He did a 4-month rehabilitation course where he was taught how to make candles for a living. At NAB, Bhavesh also took training in acupressure, braille and few other things. According to Bhavesh, he wanted to start his own business for candle making but moulds were expensive that he could not afford. He started working as massage and acupressure therapist in hotels in Mahabaleshwar. This job helped him save money with which he bought a plain candle mould and 5 kg wax. He started making plain candles and worked as a street vendor in front of Holy Cross church in Mahabaleshwar. He used to set aside Rs 25 per day for next day's raw material. Neeta, a resident of Bhayander, Mumbai, who visited Bhavesh's shop as a customer, struck a chord with him and decided to marry him despite stiff resistance from her family. Bhavesh tried to get help from many sources but he could not get the technical and professional assistance though people helped him out of sympathy. He could not get loans from banks. He failed to get help from profession candle manufacturers and institutes. He failed to get expert advice on candle making. Once, a few miscreants threw all of his candles in gutter. To get an idea about candle designs, Bhavesh used to go to shopping complexes with his wife and tried to touch and feel the different varieties of candles on display. Sunrise Candles A special scheme by NAB for blind people helped Bhavesh get a loan of Rs 15000 from Satara Bank. With this money, Dr. Bhatia purchased 15 kg of wax, two dyes and a hand cart. One of his friend, Niraj Chandan, who helped him in the early days, says, \\"I met Bhavesh Bhatia five years ago. He had put up a stall to sell candles near a church in Mahabaleshwar.\\" Niraj went to Bhavesh's house where he made the candles. \\"I could not believe my eyes. He was doing it so well. I took photographs with my digital camera and put up a small website - www.sunrisecandles.in. We advertised on Google and started getting lot of orders.\\" Then things began to change. Advertisements in Google spread their reach and they started getting orders. Bhavesh got small piece of land from one of his friends, and another friend, who was a builder, built a small candle making center on that land. Sunrise candles, which employs a team of 2500 visually impaired people, in 13 states of India now imports wax from UK and manufacture different kinds of candle which include pillar candles, floating candles, novelty candles, gel candles, toy shaped candles, fruit basket candle and traditional candles. They have developed more than 9000 scented, plain and aromatherapy candle designs. The client list of Sunrise candles includes Reliance Industries, Ranbaxy, Big Bazaar, Naroda Industries and the Rotary Club. Wax Museum Bhavesh opened a Skill development center at Moleshwar village, near Mahabaleshwar, to train physically challenged people in the art of designer candle making. Training is provided in different aspects of candle making which largely depends on type of physical disability and personal aptitude of the person. This center is known as wax museum, Made By Blind. There are mixed reviews for this museum. According to few, it may not be a wax museum in the classical sense but for many it is a satisfying and inspiring visit for a social cause. The Wax Museum consists of lifestyle statues of eminent personalities, including of Sachin Tendulkar, Amitabh Bachchan, Shri, Narendra Modiji, Aamir Khan, and many more. This center also has a free hostel for blind students, free accommodation, free mess and free skill training facilities such as candle making, marketing. Educational trips are organised for school/college students and meditation seminars/motivational lectures are organised here. Awards Bhavesh has been recognized for his entrepreneurship skills. Below are the few notable awards conferred on him. * Honorary Doctorate Degree on his contributions in Entrepreneurship on 29 May 2019 by the hands of Karnataka Higher Education Minister Hon.Shri.

It is one of only a few members of its genus to occur outside Australia and was previously known as Callistemon gnidioides Guillaumin. Description Melaleuca sphaerodendra is shrub or small tree growing to a height of with its branchlets densely covered with hairs. The leaves are long, wide, narrow oval to egg-shaped, rounded at the end and have 3 to 5 parallel veins. When young, the leaves are covered with hairs similar to those on the branchlets but become glabrous as they mature. The flowers are white or cream and occur on the ends of the branches which continue to grow after flowering. The petals are long and the stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, with 2 or 3 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs mainly from July and September and is followed by the fruit which are woody capsules long. Taxonomy and naming Callistemon gnidioides was first formally described in 1934 by Andr√© Guillaumin, then transferred to the genus Melaleuca as Melaleuca sphaerodendra in 1998 by Lyndley Craven and John Dawson in the journal Adansonia. The specific epithet (sphaerodendra) is from the Ancient Greek œÉœÜŒ±·øñœÅŒ± (spha√Æra) meaning ‚Äúball\\" and Œ¥Œ≠ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøŒΩ (d√©ndron) meaning ‚Äútree‚Äù referring to the roughly spherical crown of the tree.

Being a writer and diarist who kept journals of his travels, these and his supporting role in some of military campaigning's great moments ‚Äì Egypt in 1801, South America in 1807, Sweden in 1808, the Netherlands at various stages and Spain in 1811‚Äì12 ‚Äì have made Squire a moderately well-known figure among scholars who study the era. Early life The eldest son of Dr. John Squire (1732‚Äì1816) of Ely Place, London, the founder in 1788 the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men, he was born in London. He was educated at Charterhouse School under Matthew Raine, and, after passing through the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, he received a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in January 1797. He was promoted to be first lieutenant on 29 August 1798. In August 1799 Squire embarked with the Helder Expedition (the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland) under Sir Ralph Abercromby. He took part in the engagement of 10 September, when he was wounded. He was also in the actions of Bergen and Alkmaar on 2 and 6 October. He returned with the army to England at the end of October. In the Mediterranean In 1801 Squire went to Egypt, and served throughout the campaign there under Abercromby and under General Hutchinson. He was present at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March, the capture of Rosetta on 8 April, the capture of Fort St. Julien after a three days' siege on 19 April, the siege of Alexandria in August, and its capitulation, after an armistice of some days, on 2 September. On the conclusion of the Egyptian campaign Squire obtained leave of absence, and, in company with William Martin Leake and William Richard Hamilton, made a tour through Syria and Greece. On leaving Athens for Malta in the brig Mentor, laden with some of the Elgin marbles, Squire's party was wrecked on the island of Cythera on 17 September 1802, and narrowly escaped death. Many of the marbles and some papers were recovered. Service in South America and northern Europe Squire was promoted to be captain lieutenant in February 1803, and second captain on 19 July 1804. He was employed in the southern military district on the defences of the coast of Sussex. On 1 July 1806 he was promoted to be first captain, and appointed commanding royal engineer in the expedition to South America. He accompanied Sir Samuel Auchmuty to the R√≠o de la Plata, landing in January 1807. Squire conducted the siege operations at Montevideo: after a practicable breach was made, it was carried by storm on 3 February. He was also commanding Royal Engineer under Major-general John Whitelocke in the operations from 28 June to 5 July. It culminated in the attack on Buenos Aires and the surrender of Montevideo, and the expedition returned to England. Squire was a witness for the prosecution at the court-martial held in London in March 1808. In April 1808 Squire accompanied Sir John Moore's expedition to Sweden, and in the summer went with Moore's army to Lisbon, taking part in all the operations of the campaign, which ended on 16 January 1809 in the Battle of Coru√±a. He embarked the same night with the army for England, arriving in February. In April he was sent by Lord Castlereagh in a frigate on a secret mission to the Baltic Sea, to report on the island of Bornholm as a defensive naval station. On 28 July of the same year Squire took part in the Walcheren Campaign. He sailed, as commanding Royal Engineer to Sir John Hope's division, with the army under the Earl of Chatham to the River Scheldt. On 30 July he reconnoitred the channel and shores of the East Scheldt with Captain Peake, R.N.. He took part in the siege of Vlissingen, and was present at its capture on 14 August, returning to England in December. Peninsular War and death On 28 March 1810 Squire joined the Duke of Wellington's army in Portugal. He was employed on the lines of Torres Vedras, and on their completion was, in October, appointed regulating officer of No. 3 district, from Alhandra to the valley of Calhandriz. On the retreat of Mass√©na in March 1811, Squire accompanied Marshal Beresford's corps to the relief of Campo Maior on 25 March. At the end of March his bridges across the River Guadiana, and making a breach in the defences of Olivenza, contributed to the capture of the latter on 15 April. He was involved in the two sieges of Badajoz(5‚Äì12 May and 25 May ‚Äì 10 June), and on both occasions Wellington mentioned him in his despatches. On 21 June 1811 Squire was attached to Lieutenant-general Sir Rowland Hill's corps in Estremadura. He took part in the Battle of Arroyo dos Molinos, when the French general Girard suffered defeat on 28 October. His assistance was acknowledged by Hill in his despatch, and Squire was promoted on 5 December to be brevet major. In March 1812 Squire was one of the two directors of the attack at the third siege of Badajoz under Sir Richard Fletcher, John Fox Burgoyne being the other; they took 24 hours' duty in the trenches turn about. On the capture of Badajoz by assault, on 6 April, Squire was mentioned by Wellington in his despatch, where he refers to the assistance which Squire rendered to Major James Wilson and the 48th regiment in establishing themselves in the ravelin of San Roque. Squire was promoted to be brevet lieutenant-colonel on 27 April, and was awarded the gold medal for Badajoz. Squire continued to be attached to Hill's corps, which now attempted the destruction of the French bridge of boats at Almarez. But the siege of Badajoz had exhausted him; and, having repaired the bridge of M√©rida, he was hastening to join Hill when he fell from his horse and was carried to Trujillo. There he died of fever on 19 May 1812. One of his contemporaries, Lt. Col. John Fox Burgoyne CRE wrote in his diary on 23 May 1812 \\"We also learn that poor Squire died suddenly of a paralytic stroke at Truxillo; thus we have lost, in my mind, the best officer of the Corps, and a man who, I believe, never had an enemy\\" Works During his stay in Egypt, with William Martin Leake and William Richard Hamilton, Squire deciphered the Greek inscription on Pompey's pillar at Alexandria. On arriving back in England, early in 1803, Squire and Leake presented to the Society of Antiquaries of London a memoir on the Pillar. It was read on 3 February by Matthew Raine of Charterhouse, who had suggested characters to replace the eighteen which were entirely obliterated (Arch√¶ologia, vol. xv.). Squire's journal is a source for his tour in Syria with Hamilton and Leake. Extracts were published in 1817. In 1810 Squire published anonymously A Short Narrative of the late Campaign of the British Army, &c.;, with Preliminary Remarks on the Topography and Channels of Zeeland (2nd ed. same year). This work was critical of the conduct of the campaign. Squire also made detailed criticisms of the early Peninsular campaign, in letters to Henry Bunbury. Some of this correspondence survives. In May 2016 a BBC Australian news article described the chance finding of one of his handwritten journals in a second-hand bookstore in Hobart, Tasmania. Previously unknown of, the journal covers the period from 12 May to 22 July 1811 and records technical aspects of the English-Portuguese army's first and second sieges of Badajoz before its fall a year later.

Biography He was born in March, 1865 in Warsaw, Poland. His father was a merchant who was the son of a rabbi. Two of Hermann‚Äôs brothers were also rabbis, and his inclination was to join them as a spiritual leader. During his studies he became aware of the Christian worship of Jesus and in 1889 he attended a sermon in Breslau given by the Scottish missionary, Daniel Edwards. Over the next months Edwards mentored Warszawiak whilst he studied the Scriptures. He eventually took the decision to be baptised into the Christian faith and this occurred on October 6, 1889. There was shock and anger in the Jewish community and in Warszawiak‚Äôs family at this news. For his own safety he was moved to Scotland, leaving behind his wife and two children. He continued his studies and trained with the Free Church of Scotland in the New College, Edinburgh. However, before he could be ordained he was moved, this time to New York because of the continued concerns for his safety. He carried letters of introduction, including one to the Rev. John Hall, the veteran pastor of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. Very soon, Warszawiak joined this church and started preaching at Rev, Jacob Freshman‚Äôs Hebrew Christian Church, St Mark‚Äôs Place. Later he used the De Witt Memorial Hall, with support from the New York City Mission and Tract Society. Warszawiak worked in the Jewish quarter in Lower East Side Manhattan, where many of the refugees from Europe had settled. He was an experienced preacher and could hold the attention of a large audience. His meetings were often so well attended that many could not get in to hear him. Some of his critics complained that he was using inducements to swell the numbers, advertising free electric picture shows to those who attended. He started to expand his horizons and formed the American Mission to the Jews, breaking away from the New York City Mission. He also opened a shelter for persecuted Christian Jews and planned to build a church. Funding came from supporters in America and Scotland including a lady called Miss Catherine DouglasCatherine Grace Douglas (1828-1898) was the daughter of Lord William Robert Keith Douglas who sponsored an early biography of Warszawiak titled The Little Messianic Prophet, published in 1892.Hermann Warszawiak referred to as The Little Messianic Prophet due to his small stature; according to his passport application he was 5 feet 2 inches in height She also forwarded a sum of money to help him in his work. He did not declare this to the head of the Mission, Rev. Dr. A. F. Schauffler, and this soured the relationship between the two men. Large amounts of the money that had been given to Warszawick by donors for his missionary work could not be accounted for and in 1898 he was forced into bankruptcy. One of his largest creditors, Anninka Nicolas, lost about $26,000 and refused to release him from his bankruptcy; she was still pursuing him through the courts up till her death in 1913. Warszawiak applied to the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church to be ordained and this was supported by the Pastor of the church, Dr John Hall. A committee appointed to review his application rejected his request, saying that he recognised no authority but that of God, and that there were questions over his honesty and financial probity. To back up their case, a senior member of the church employed a private detective who stated that Warszawiak had attended a gambling establishment. The church focussed on these accusations and Warszawiak was put on trial; the case initially went against him, but on appeal, the General Assembly refused to uphold the verdict. An independent inquiry also found in Warszawiak's favour. Although Warszawiak‚Äôs name had been cleared he found it difficult to continue his association with the Fifth Avenue Church. For a few years he operated independently, then became a member of the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church of John Alexander Dowie, but was dismissed in 1904. He eventually ceased his missionary work. In about 1910 he was associated with a broker called William T. Wintemute, who was selling fraudulent gold mine shares, but it was not clear if Warszawiak was aware of the criminal aspect of this business. Warszawiak changed the family name to Warwick whilst in England in about 1907.Detail recorded on WWI Draft Registration Card of his eldest son dated 1917. He died November 25, 1921 in a 174th Street tenement block, Manhattan, and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.Copy death certificate Notes References 1865 births 1921 deaths Converts to Calvinism from Judaism Polish Jews Polish emigrants to the United States Clergy from Warsaw ","title":"Hermann Warszawiak"},{"id":"46497138","text":"Wee-Lek Chew (born 1932) is a Singaporean-born botanist.

The show was produced by Walt Disney Creative Entertainment, under direction of Steve Davison. Disneyland Forever incorporates fireworks, projection mapping, fire, lasers, and searchlights to depict scenes from Disney films. The show's original run ended on September 5th, 2016 upon conclusion of the Diamond Celebration. The shows exit song, \\"A Kiss Goodnight\\", would be later be released on CD with a book bearing the song's name. http://www.insidethemagic.net/merchandise/fireworks-walt-disney-eternally- intertwined-described-richard-shermans-new-book-kiss-goodnight/ A second run for Disneyland Forever began on June 7, 2019, marking the first time the show has been presented since the end of the Diamond Celebration. https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2019/04/theres-still-time-to-get-your- ears-on-at-disneyland-resort/ Many enhanced elements that were developed for Mickey's Mix Magic were incorporated into the show. On August 2, 2019, it was confirmed on a livestream of the first performance of the Main Street Electrical Parade that the show would have its final 2019 performance on September 2, 2019. Disneyland Forever closed at Disneyland again on September 2, 2019 to prepare for the return of Halloween Screams for public showing for the first time since opening year on September 6, 2019.  Technical details  Disneyland Forever features fireworks launched both from backstage areas and from selected locations within the park, as well as the largest projection mapping display ever presented in a Disney park (prior to introduction of Happily Ever After in Magic Kingdom Park on May 12, 2017 and Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland on July 10, 2018). During the show, video and images are projected on Sleeping Beauty Castle, the buildings along Main Street USA, the Matterhorn, the facade of It's a Small World, and along the Rivers of America (on the water screens from Fantasmic and since 2019, with a water fountains added), using a total of 25 projectors. The projections in each area are different in order to evenly distribute crowds and to encourage people to view the show multiple times from different locations. The show also features fire effects, lasers, searchlights, and other effects, and is approximately fourteen minutes and forty-seven seconds long. The projection mapping technology installed for Disneyland Forever would remain after the show concluded its initial run; it has since been implemented in Remember... Dreams Come True (albeit without Main Street projections); Disney's Celebrate America; Halloween Screams (and Mickey's Halloween Party in general); Believe... In Holiday Magic for the holiday season; Together Forever, the Pixar fireworks spectacularhttps://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2017/07/new- pixar-pier-to-bring-favorite-pixar-stories-to-life-at-disney-california- adventure-park-limited-time-pixar-fest-celebration-coming-throughout- disneyland-resort/; and Mickey's Mix Magic, the Mickey's 90th anniversary fireworks show.  Show summary  Two new songs were written for the show: the theme song \\"Live the Magic\\" and the exit song \\"Kiss Goodnight\\", the latter of which was written by composer Richard M. Sherman and sung by Broadway star Ashley Brown. Other songs co-written by Sherman and his late brother, Robert B. Sherman, including \\"Step in Time\\" from Mary Poppins and \\"Heffalumps and Woozles\\" from The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh are also featured in the show. The rest of the soundtrack includes music, songs, and audio from Disney and Pixar films and archival footage of Walt Disney. The show features seven themed sections: *\\"Opening\\": A traditional fanfare, complete with 94 high powered searchlights - ultimately forming a diamond over Sleeping Beauty Castle and Main Street USA (as well as other 17 searchlights across Rivers of America as of June 2019) - opens the show (in the alternate version, a low level pyrotechnics was included). As images of orange groves are projected around the viewing areas, the opening narration describes how, 60 years ago, the area where Disneyland currently stands was an orange grove. As the projected oranges grow larger, they burst into pixie dust. Walt Disney‚Äôs declaration that \\"as long as there‚Äôs imagination left in the world, Disneyland will never be complete\\" ushers in Peter Pan and a live action Tinker Bell. Peter encourages Tinker Bell to sprinkle her pixie dust on the castle as they show the audience \\"how magical this place can be\\", leading into \\"Live the Magic.\\" *\\"Clouds\\": Projections of the rooftops of London accompany the song \\"Step in Time\\" from Mary Poppins (Dick Van Dyke recorded new chants as the character Bert for this sequence). Projected kites then segue into floating lanterns as \\"I See the Light\\" from Tangled is performed. *\\"Enchanted Places\\": A projection of Winnie the Pooh floats to the top of the castle and dives into a honeycomb to introduce a sequence featuring the songs \\"Rumbly in My Tumbly\\" and \\"Heffalumps and Woozles\\" from The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. *\\"Jungle\\": The song \\"Circle of Life\\", a fireworks \\"sunrise\\", and projected animals recreate the opening scene of The Lion King. The scene then transitions to Angkor Wat from The Jungle Book as King Louie performs \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\". A \\"wild jazz number\\" punctuated by rainstorm effects and waterfalls follow. *\\"Sea\\": Giant inflatable coral structures and projections of underwater scenes accompany Ariel and Sebastian from The Little Mermaid as they perform \\"Under the Sea\\". The number ends abruptly as projections of the Tank Gang from \\"Finding Nemo\\" encourage a Nemo puppet suspended above the castle to swim through the \\"Ring of Fire\\". Projections, smoke and lighting effects on the Matterhorn transform it into Mt. Wannahockaloogie. *\\"Snow\\": The projected smoke and ash from the volcano transition into snow as artificial foam snow begins to fall in the viewing areas. Queen Elsa of Arendelle appears to perform \\"Let It Go\\" and projections on the Matterhorn transform it into her snow palace. *\\"Finale\\": The narrator declares that Disneyland will continue to grow and that \\"the magic, as Walt assured us, will never end.\\" Searchlights, lasers, and projections of Sleeping Beauty Castle, the buildings on Main Street, and the facade of It's a Small World moving and dancing accompany \\"When You Wish upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio and a reprise of \\"Live the Magic.\\" As the buildings 'disintegrate' and the finale culminates, a projection of Walt hand-in-hand with Mickey Mouse is shown and Peter Pan is heard exclaiming that \\"(Disneyland) is yours‚Ä¶forever!\\" A bright ensemble of fireworks punctuate the finale.

Pyrotechnics that launched in the area was cut as well.  Alternate versions  In cases where inclement weather (eg: winds) will affect the night‚Äôs performance, alternate versions are considered. * For its debut season, the finale segment was shown with slightly different projections are seen in their respective viewing areas, while the searchlights and lasers still function. This precedent was first used in 2007 for Believe... In Holiday Magic snowfall finale and later in Remember... Dreams Come True. * For its 2019 return, additional low-level fireworks were introduced the weekend of July 6, 2019. That night‚Äôs showing saw select new fireworks (including those were previously used in original run) mixed with the traditional shells. A version consisting of all low-level pyrotechnics, including the standard assortments for regular performances, premiered the following evening due to high winds. It is expected to be the B-show for those occasions, following a precedent started in the 2018 holiday season. Neither Tinker Bell nor Nemo make appearances for those reasons, and for safety considerations although Nemo makes appearances on August 24. * On rare occasions, Mickey‚Äôs Mix Magic will take its place.

Work began on the memorial in 1980, but it was not until 2000, ten years after Uchytilov√°'s death, that it was completed by her husband. The \\"Garden of Peace and Friendship\\" adjoins the memorial. Background On 10 June 1942 the Nazis killed all 173 adult men and 52 women in Lidice as a reprisal for the assassination of Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich, the Reichsprotektor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The village was razed, seventeen children who were considered suitable to be \\"Germanized\\" were removed, and the remaining women and children, separated, were sent to concentration camps. The children were gassed that summer in mobile vans at Che≈Çmno. Following the war, a cross was erected at Lidice in remembrance of the murdered children, but little else occurred for the next two decades. Features In 1980, the sculptor Marie Uchytilov√° began plans for a memorial which would not only commemorate the local children who died at the camps but symbolize the \\"13 million child victims of World War II.\\" Before starting on the castings, Uchytilov√° met the surviving mothers to understand the physical features and the personality traits of the children, and viewed pictures of them. However, she ensured that the sculptures were not fully recognizable. Towards the end of this period, before Uchytilov√°'s death in 1989, she had only created plaster images of the despairing children; it was left to her husband, Ji≈ô√≠ Hampel, to complete the work in bronze castings. Financing of the memorial was facilitated by donations from the Government of Czech Republic, as well as individual and foreign donors. The memorial, with statues rotated facing forward for 180 degrees, was finally erected in 2000. With a view of the old town of Lidice, it is set in a meadow where the villagers had been killed during the war.

It was built in 1914 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 2013. The building was listed as an example of early 20th century educational and Neoclassical architecture in rural Portage County and one of the few remaining buildings from that era still standing. Until 2004, the building was in use as a school, known as Mantua Center Elementary School. It housed grades kindergarten through four as one of four elementary schools in the Crestwood Local School District. Previously, the building had served first as a grades 1‚Äì12 school for students in Mantua Township, known as the Mantua Township School, and after 1948 as a school for grades 1‚Äì7 following consolidation of the Mantua Township and Mantua Village school districts. It continued as a 1‚Äì7 building until the late 1950s when Crestwood Middle School opened. An addition with a multi-purpose gymnasium and stage was completed in 1964. Following the conclusion of the 2003‚Äì04 school year in June, the building was closed and sold to the Mantua Township Trustees. It, along with three other elementary schools in the district, was replaced by two new consolidated elementary schools, one for grades K‚Äì2 and the other for grades 3‚Äì5. Since then, the newer portion of the building has functioned as a community center while the original building has limited use for office space by the township government. History During the early days of public education in Ohio, schools were divided into several small districts centered on a one-room schoolhouse. In the late 19th century, a movement started to centralize these schools into a single building with students divided into grade levels. The first school district to centralize in Portage County was Ravenna City in 1859 followed by Kent nine years later. Many of the more rural township schools, however, did not start centralizing schools until the early 20th century. Mantua Township centralized schools in 1903, housing students in buildings in and around what is now the Mantua Center District. The construction of the Mantua Center School was driven mainly by township residents' desire for modern and safe educational facilities, to replace the wooden frame buildings that had previously been serving as schools. The deadly Collinwood school fire in 1908, which occurred nearby in what is now part of Cleveland and killed 172 students, and prevention of the spread of cholera were two of the primary reasons. The construction of the building also occurred during a period of time where other districts were opening new centralized buildings. Between 1913 and 1920, 21 new centralized schools were built in Portage County. The new school building opened in October 1914 and students simply gathered their belongings in the previous buildings and carried them to the new school across the street one block north. The school became a social center for the community similar to other centralized schools. Initially it housed all grades (1‚Äì12) with high school classes occupying three classrooms and the remaining grades in four rooms. The school housed students in all grades until 1948, when the Mantua Village School District was merged with the township district to form the Mantua Local School District. Under the consolidated district, high school students (grades 8‚Äì12) attended the Mantua Village School while elementary students (grades 1‚Äì7) attended Mantua Center School. Two additional classrooms were added to the Mantua Center School by converting space in an adjacent building on the property. This arrangement continued even after Shalersville Township joined the district in 1952 to form the Mantua‚ÄìShalersville Local School District. Continued enrollment growth in the 1950s resulted in construction of a new high school in Mantua Village in 1956, at which point the district was renamed for the local phone exchange, Crestwood. A few years later, a new junior high school was built near the high school and Mantua Center School was used as an elementary school for grades K‚Äì4. An addition was built in 1964 that included a multi-purpose gymnasium and classrooms. The K‚Äì4 setup continued until 2004 when two new consolidated elementary schools, Crestwood Primary for grades K‚Äì2 and Crestwood Intermediate for grades 3‚Äì5, were completed in Mantua Township just north of the high school and middle school campus. An evaluation of the district's buildings in the 1990s by the Ohio School Facilities Commission recommended replacing the four aging elementary schools, all of which had previously served as centralized schools, rather than spend millions of dollars to bring each one up to code. Voters approved the bond issue to build the new schools in the early 2000s. Mantua Center School was sold to the Mantua Township Trustees for $147,500. Since purchasing the building, the 1964 addition has been used for various community events and meetings while the Mantua Township trustees use some of the original 1914 building for offices. Architecture Front view of the original building in late 2013 The original 1914 Mantua Center School is an example of Neoclassical architecture, prominent in the United States during the early 20th century. The building was designed by architect Peter T. Cahill, who was based in Cleveland at the time, and the general contractor was Loomis, Seymour, and Company. The original building cost $32,500 ($ in dollars) and had of space on three levels with seven classrooms on the top two floors and small gymnasium and cafeteria areas on the lowest levels. The building also contained indoor restrooms, located in the basement, which were unusual for rural buildings in the early 20th century. Architect Peter Cahill was a graduate of nearby Hiram College in 1911 and had previously designed the school for neighboring Hiram Township, which opened in 1913. In March 1913, Cahill authored an article in The Ohio Architect, Engineer and Builder urging the state to develop building codes that would prohibit construction of school buildings using wood since wood was far more prone to damage from floods and fire. Cahill was a proponent of masonry construction and cement walls and had observed the extensive damage caused to buildings as a result of the Great Flood of 1913, which occurred in late March of that year, while the disastrous Collinwood school fire of 1908 was still a recent memory. Cahill's choice for the design of Mantua Center School may have been influenced by the original facade of the Old Main building at Hiram College, which had been remodeled by the 1880s and has since been demolished. The classical designs of the nearby buildings that now constitute the Mantua Center District may have also been influences on his design, which includes elements of Georgian and Greek Revival architecture. The 1964 addition was built using a flat-roofed minimalist style prominent in educational architecture in the mid-20th century. The addition includes a multi-purpose gymnasium, kitchen, restrooms and storage. Historic listing The Mantua Center School was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places under Criteria A and C. The building is significant in the area of Community Planning and Development in Criterion A as it is one of the early, and few remaining, examples in Portage County of a centralized rural school, from an era when most of the rural schools districts in the area and state transitioned from multiple school houses to central buildings. Between 1913 and 1920, 21 new centralized schools were built in the county, though only five of those schools are still standing and none are used for classes. Four of those buildings, including the Mantua Center School, have been re- purposed, one is abandoned, while the remaining buildings have since been demolished. The building was nominated under the Architecture area of Criterion C as an example of an early 20th century Neoclassical educational facility.

The fallas are placed in the streets during the Falles festival in Valencia (Spain), and in other towns with festivals inspired by it. The monument usually deals with a satirical subject connected with recent news or public controversies, and is covered in posters with words, verses and statements of a humorous nature. The monument is made with combustible materials (cardboard, wood, paper, clothing, expanded polystyrene, etc.) which are then burned in the streets after being on show for a few days. Falla in Valencia. Origin and evolution  In medieval Valencian the word Falla named the torches that were placed on top of watchtowers. This word is derived from Latin Facula, torch. In the Llibre dels feits, it is stated that the troops of King James I of Aragon carried Fallas to light their way. The material origin of the monumento fallero was burning waste from carpenters and private homes. That is to say, it came from popular festivities and those of local guilds. It was often children who, on the eve of Saint Joseph's festivity, patron saint of the woodworkers guild, made the collection with things such as cattail chairs, old furniture, brooms or grass mats on the eve of Saint Joseph's festivity, patron saint of the woodworkers guild. In this, the fallas festivity was not very different from the Hogueras de San Juan (for example those in Alicante), which are held throughout Europe or the bonfires of Hogueras de San Antonio also very typical of Valencia too. The specific quality of the Fallas comes from the fact that it is a festival of particular neighbourhoods in which locals take the opportunity to criticize each other. With the creation of the first, very rudimentary, figures, came the burlesque, satirical posters. These criticisms were often directed at the municipal power, the church or the state. This first stage of the festivity ranges from its uncertain beginnings to the last decades of the nineteenth century. In those days the ninots were made of waste, paper, wood and cardboard. It is around the turn of the century when the first ninots with a cloth body and a head and hands made of wax appeared. The creation of these takes a lot more work so we can say that the figure of the fallero artist is born. This period lasts until the 1920s‚Äì1930s. There is at this stage a transformation in the festivity, with the appearance of mold cardboard figures. This technique allowed for the building of higher monuments and it has come down almost to the present day, where it is still used, especially for smaller ninots and fallas of lower budgets. An advantage inside the disadvantage of the mold technique is the possibility of making the same ninot indefinitely. Therefore, the fallas with bigger budgets made original molds every year, which were used by others at a lower price the following years. Finally, from 1990s appeared the technique of expanded polystyrene or Styrofoam. Its lighter weight allows for more height in the monuments, and requires greater innovation in design.  Construction of the figures  As the monuments can be very high (often more than 10 meters), a specific technique has been developed to build them. The step is to prepare a draft and perhaps a scale model which must be approved by the comisi√≥n fallera (a committee formed by a group of people who support or finance a falla in a neighborhood of Valencia) who hires the artist. The structure (scaffold) is constructed of wood and then all materials (cardboard, wax, cloth, etc.) are used. Though years ago they could use wire, currently these materials are prohibited by the Junta Central Fallera (which regulates and coordinates this festivity). Ninots are traditionally constructed from molds, which are usually made of plaster, and are filled with pulp, which are painted after drying. But today, for convenience and ease of use, new materials are used, such as porespan, resin or fiberglass. These new materials make the monuments lighter and the Falla artists can take risks to create bold and innovative forms.  Criticism of new materials  Many people criticize these new materials, referred to as white cork, since the black smoke they give off during the burning of the monument means the combustion can't be seen clearly. The pollution that these new materials cause has also been criticised in comparison with the supposedly lighter pollution from traditional materials. The Polytechnic University of Valencia carried out a study which seems to prove that, on the contrary, white cork is less polluting than the traditional materials. The student of Fallas Manuel Sanchis Ambr√≥s carried out a study in which he assured that even though the combustion of cork gave off more heat, the combustion of wood and liquid materials used in making a wood structure is clearly more polluting.Noticia sobre la contaminaci√≥n en Fallas A few years later (2013), the same university went back to the traditional method of falla making in view of its greater environmental sustainability.Noticia sobre la contaminaci√≥n de las Fallas  Experimental changes in the Fallas  Ninot in tribute to Manolo Mart√≠n L√≥pez, built in the 2011 Na Jordana monument by his son Manuel Mart√≠n Huguet with designs by Sento Llobell. During the 80's, it was, above all, the Valencia City Hall Square Falla‚Äîformerly known as the Valencian Community Falla, it's the only one made entirely with public money and so, it doesn't participate in the official competition‚Äîthat introduced a series of experimental changes. The cartoonist Sento Llobell and the designer Francis Montesinos, who dressed up ninots, collaborated with the artist Manolo Mart√≠n. From this period, we recall Fallas such as that which recreated the fa√ßade of the Valencia CIty Hall or the crane that excavated the ground, finding thousands of objects.Estudio de El Pa√≠s  Parts of a Falla  Although there‚Äôs not a single method to make a Falla, traditionally it has been divided in the scenes at the bottom representing different situations, usually critical of an event, and bigger dolls making up the central body. Signs with some Valencian rhymes show the broad theme. The remate, which represents the general theme of it, is usually a figure placed on the bigger one standing at the centre of the Falla. The special section Fallas, the most important section, does not follow that exact pattern and usually have more than one remate.  Fallas themes  The themes of the Fallas have changed throughout history. In the beginning, they served to criticize what happened in the neighborhoods or dealt with issues of a very local nature. But, little by little, sometimes in a hidden manner, they started to criticize people who were important locally. Since the Spanish transition to democracy the Fallas have turned to more global topics. Nowadays they criticize political and social issues from each community, national or global point of view. However, there are a lots of Fallas which make use of their satirical purpose in order to criticize banal topics like TV shows, celebrities etc.  Types  Each Comisi√≥n fallera erects a large Falla and a children's one. The latter has small measurements and the ninots are smaller. Similarly, children's Fallas make use of their satirical and ironic nature in a less acute form. Photography of a children's Falla.  Awards  The Fallas monuments receive different prizes according to the categories of the Fallas and the subject matter. The most valued prize of all categories is the First Prize of all Sections. The most important prizes of each section are the first prize of section, the first one in inventiveness and grace, and the first prize to the alternative Falla. Furthermore, Generalitat Valenciana, Diputaci√≥n de Valencia, Bonfires of Saint John and Junta Gestora de la Magdalena, as well as other private entities also give their own prizes which often include a sum of money.

The name is inspired by Simurgh the Persian mythical flying creature, to which healing capacities have been attributed in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh. History of Simurgh Simurgh goes back to ancient Iranian empires. This is a stylized design of Simurgh which was used as the emblem of the Sassanid dynasty. The concept and the logo design of the Healing Simurgh was approved by the supreme board of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Medical Council in November 2013 as the emblem of the Physicians Guild of Iran, replacing the Caduceus. In the summer of 2013, the emblem was introduced by Mahmoud Fazel, MD, the vice president of Iran's Medical Council. It was later developed by a group of renowned scholars including Jalal al-Din Kazzazi, Persian literary scholar, Mehdi Mohaghegh, author and director of the Society for the Appreciation of Cultural works and Dignitaries, Alireza Zali, President of Iran's Medical Council, Professor Nasrin Moazzemi, Biologist and member of UNESCO's Scientific Board of the International Basic Sciences Programme, and Ali Javadi Pouya, sustainable development activist and the CEO of Iran's Sustainable Development Strategy Group. The board formed a permanent association to continue with the subsequent activities required for the overhaul of Iran's national emblem for medicine, and for safeguarding this intangible cultural heritage. The previous sign (bowl and snakes) was considered to be primarily focused on physical health. However, in the works of the prominent Iranian scholar and one of the precursors of medicine in the world, Avicenna, there is a more comprehensive understanding of health. He claims that health (sihha) is the \\"disposition of human body with respect to its temperament and structure such that all of [its] actions [or functions] proceed from it in a sound and unimpaired way.\\" Cited in McGinnis, Jon. Avicenna. London: Oxford University Press, 2010: 235-236. Thus the board argued that the Healing Simurgh can better represent the Iranian historical concept of health.  The Healing Simurgh's Logo  The official logo of the Healing Simurgh was designed by Touraj Saberivand, and Iranian graphic designer, and was also published as a posting stamp by the Islamic Republic of Iran Post Company.

It stars Barry Newman and Suzy Kendall, with supporting roles by John Vernon, Dolph Sweet, and Ben Kingsley in his feature film debut. The film features a soundtrack by Roy Budd. Plot John Talbot is talking on radio to a woman and a man who is flying a plane. He hears them being machine gunned to death by another plane. Some time later, Talbot appears in a small town in Louisiana, where he starts a fight with some local police. He is arrested and faces trial, where it is revealed he is wanted for killing a policeman and robbing a bank. Talbot escapes from the courtroom, shooting another policeman and kidnapping a woman, Sarah Ruthven. A car chase ensues. Talbot and Sarah meet up with a mysterious man, Jablonsky, who reveals that Sarah is the daughter of an oil millionaire. Jablonsky turns Talbot and Sarah over to Sarah's father. A man working for him, Vyland, hires Talbot for an unspecified task. Jablonsky is retained to guard Talbot. It is then revealed that Jablonsky and Talbot know each other and have arranged the whole scenario for an unspecified reason. Late at night, Talbot sneaks out of the house and travels to an oil platform to search for something. When he returns he sees Vyland's henchmen burying something ‚Äì it is Jablonsky's body. Talbot then sneaks into Sarah's room and makes a confession: all the events up until the present time are part of a scheme. The brawl in the town was to get Talbot into court. The shootout in court was faked; Talbot shot the policeman with blanks. Sarah was invited there deliberately so she could be kidnapped. Everything was set up to get Talbot and Jablonsky into the house. Talbot says her father used his money for a stake in a salvage operation but didn't know about Vyland, and that Sarah and her father are in danger, especially after the death of Jablonsky. Talbot asks Sarah for her help, although he won't say what his plan is or what is going on. Talbot is hired to operate a submersible for an unspecified project. He goes to an oil platform with Sarah, Ruthven, Vyland, Royale and Larry. Talbot deliberately delays the launch of the submersible. Larry begins to suspect Talbot and pulls a gun on him but falls off the platform and dies. With Sarah's help, Talbot then kills another of Vyland's men. He calls for help from the mainland but the authorities cannot fly to the platform because of the storm. He is forced to enter the submersible with Vyland and Royale. The submersible approaches the wreck of a Douglas DC-3. Vyland admits to Talbot he is looking for cargo. Talbot says he knows what the cargo is ‚Äì over $80 million in uncut diamonds. Talbot then switches off the oxygen and tells Vyland and Royale they will die in six minutes. Talbot says the diamonds were a payment from the Colombian government to buy arms during a revolution. They hired a plane from a small airline, Talbot's, but it was shot down by people who knew what was on the flight. Talbot says the plane contained his brother, his wife and his 3-year-old son. He has planned his revenge over three years. Talbot tells Vyland and Royale he is willing to die on the ocean floor beside his family. He asks who ordered the destruction of the plane. Vyland confesses it was him, which is heard by Talbot's associates on the oil platform via microphone. Royale shoots Vyland dead. He then confesses to killing Jablonsky. Talbot turns on the oxygen and returns to the surface.

Film rights were bought by producer Elliott Kastner who had filmed a number of MacLean novels. MacLean wrote the scripts for the two earlier Kastner films, Where Eagles Dare and Where Eight Bells Toll but was too busy to do the script for Fear is the Key so the job went to Robert Carrington. The car chase was choreographed by Carey Loftin, who had worked on Vanishing Point which also starred Barry Newman. Newman said he enjoyed making Fear is the Key. \\"I thought the character that I played was a lovely character for the kind of film it was, an Alistair MacLean story.\\" Reception The film was a box office disappointment in the US but performed better in Europe. It was one of the most popular movies of 1973 at the British box office.
