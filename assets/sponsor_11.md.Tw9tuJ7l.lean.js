The Person Dignity Theory was conceived like a \\"third way\\" between capitalism and communism, both of which it refuted for their strictly materialist views, with the establishment of a social market economy. Both capitalism and communism assume that people are only production instruments, while the Person Dignity Theory promote a spiritual like physical person, with consequential change of the supply and demand based not on the singular but on the community. The Personal Dignity Theory is based on \\"Three Theories\\": *Personalism *Community (the community's good) *Supernatural (as opposed to materialism) For the creation of a good community, it's necessary the individual's will. The ideal community, as the Person Dignity Theory, is based on family, society, nation, humanity and nature. The supernatural strengthen the community for obtained \\"true, compassion, unity\\".

On August 30, 2017, it was announced that longtime Simpsons score composer Alf Clausen was let go from the series. The series switched from a live orchestrated score to a produced score by Bleeding Fingers Music. Hans Zimmer (who composed the score for The Simpsons Movie) and Russel Emanuel are score producers, with Steve Kofsky executive producing. Clausen's last episode was \\"Whistler's Father\\". During February 2018, episodes of The Simpsons were held back to avoid competing with the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, Super Bowl LII, the 2018 Winter Olympics, and the 90th Academy Awards. This resulted in a nine-week gap in between new episodes, and is the second season to not have any new episodes airing in February, after the twenty-fifth season (which also aired in a Winter Olympics year).

(1998). Sternwheelers and Steam Tugs. Winlaw, British Columbia: Sono Nis Press. She was a large freight and passenger steamship and the first in a series of CPR riverboats built for the Arrow Lakes.Crowsnest.bc.ca,. 'S.S. Kootenay'. N.p., 2015. Web. 30 June 2015. Construction In the 1890s, CPR purchased the Columbia and Kootenay Steam Navigation Company (C&KSN;), which had hitherto provided steam transportation services on the Arrow Lakes. Soon after the takeover, CPR commissioned a series of three new vessels to improve services on the lakes and expand traffic in the Slocan Valley during the prosperous years of the late 1800s. Kootenay was the first to be built and was a large, attractively designed riverboat almost identical to the earlier Nakusp, but slightly larger. Kootenay was also considered a sister ship to Aberdeen, which ran on Okanagan Lake.Cox, Doug. (1995). S.S. Sicamous: Queen of Okanagan Lake. Penticton, British Columbia: Skookum Publications. Kootenay was built at Nakusp yard at Rosebery, near Slocan Lake, by Thomas Bulger and his workers. Kootenay was the largest steamer on the upper Columbia River until the launch of Bonnington in 1911 and had two passenger decks with large lounges and a dining saloon, a freight deck for fuel and cargo, and a wheelhouse. Her engines came from the sternwheeler William Irving, which had been wrecked on the lower Fraser River in 1894. William Irving was considerably smaller than Kootenay, so the latter was underpowered and slow. However, she operated successfully for many years. She had an elaborate system of hog chains and cables to strengthen her wooden hull. Kootenay was launched in April, 1897 at Nakusp. Service years With the addition of Kootenay, a large, modern vessel, to the Arrow Lakes service fleet, CPR was able to provide daily service to the surrounding communities. With the Nakusp, Kootenay traveled daily between Arrowhead and Trail. Other vessels were available for relief, freight, and to service the route from Trail south to Northport. Renovation During the lay-up period of the winter of 1908 to 1909, several Arrow Lake ships, including Kootenay, underwent renovations to accommodate the increased tourist traffic. On Rossland, the Texas deck, or upper deck, was expanded to increase the number of staterooms and Kootenay underwent a similar modification. The following winter, Minto was renovated as well. The cost of the work on Kootenay was $3159 CAD. Winter 1916 The winter of 1916 brought record low temperatures and heavy snowfalls. On January 11, Kootenay became stranded in ice near Cottonwood Island, at the head of Lower Arrow Lake. Minto brought the passengers to safety, but Kootenay remained stranded for several weeks and relied on wood cut on shore for fuel when coal ran out. Finally, she was able to break out by smashing open a channel with the paddlewheel. Although Kootenay survived, her hull was significantly damaged, which limited her future use. Crew Kootenay's crew in 1897 consisted of master W.E. Nesbitt, purser A.W. Shiels, chief engineer J.E. Jeffcott, pilot P. Wilson, first officer E.C. Bridgeman, second engineer J. Johnston, freight clerk Fred B. Wright, steward William Dyson, express messenger J.G. Millard, and bar manager J.S. Byron.Nesteroff, Greg. 'Christmas Cards From Kootenay‚ÄôS Past - Nelson Star'. Nelson Star. N.p., 2015. Web. 30 June 2015. By 1913, the captain had become G. Robertson and the chief engineer was A. Thompson.(May 1913) Canadian Railway and Marine World. Retirement Kootenay had a wooden hull, which proved to be a disadvantage because it required constant maintenance and easily became weak and waterlogged. New, steel-hulled steamers such as Bonnington, launched in 1911, with larger and better accommodations, larger freight capacity, new machinery, and advanced design took over transportation services. Kootenay was retired 1919 and sold in 1920. She was left to rot at Crescent Bay near Nakusp. However, the steamships' historical significance and role in the development of the region are evident, as Christmas cards bearing photos of the ships and crews with greetings have become valuable to collectors. In 2012, a Kootenay card from 1897 sold for $162.50 USD.

Content Q-News was founded by its then chief editor, Fuad Nahdi, and was published by Q-News Media Limited in March 1992. The magazine was a small, independent, monthly magazine, which had an online and print version. It was created as a fortnightly tabloid publication before it evolved into a monthly magazine format. The magazine was disestablished in October 2011. The magazine was representative of alternative-commercial media with independent ownership combined with a political and religious mission. It provided a mix of lifestyle and information featuring cultural, political, religious stories focusing on their relevance to Muslims around the world. It provided independent analysis, critique, and review of current affairs, politics, culture, ideas and spirituality. It engaged in a political struggle for civil liberties, rights, political participation, and inclusion of Muslims in British society. It focused on issues and themes of common concern to Muslims. The magazine was politically independent as it is not financed by any one particular country or regime. It received financial support primarily from advertising and subscriptions; its advertising revenue came mostly from private Islamic companies and charity organisations. Each issue had between 50 and 78 pages and a print run of 20,000. Q-News had staff of 60 unpaid people, 30 of whom were journalists, 27 were freelancers, and three were writers.

It was the singer's second single on MGM Records, released in September 1947. Background According to biographer Colin Escott, Ramona Vincent, a crippled woman, wrote the words of the song as a poem and sent it to Williams, who put a melody to it. The song was paired with Fred Rose's novelty \\"Fly Trouble,\\" resulting in perhaps the oddest single the singer ever released. The song was recorded at Castle Studio in Nashville on August 4, 1947 with Rose producing. Williams was backed by Tommy Jackson (fiddle), Hermon Herron (steel guitar), Sammy Pruett (lead guitar), Slim Thomas (rhythm guitar), and Lum York (bass). Hank had scored his first Billboard hit with \\"Move It on Over\\" but \\"On the Banks of the Old Ponchartrain\\" bombed. As Escott notes: :The coupling of \\"Fly Trouble\\" and \\"On the Banks of the Old Ponchartrain\\" flopped miserably, and in later years Hank would use it as a personal metaphor for a poor selling record. \\"Sure am glad it ain't another damn 'Ponchartrain,'\\" he'd say when people would congratulate him on a hit. More than anything, it proved how much Rose had yet to learn about Hank's music and his audience.

It has the mandate, under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW), to develop land rights among Aboriginal people in New South Wales through its network of 120 Local Aboriginal Land Councils (LALC). Its functions include the creation of an economic base for Aboriginal communities, as well as the continued passing and enhancement of Aboriginal culture, identity and heritage through the management of traditional sites and other cultural materials within NSW. It acts as an advisor to governments and others to ensure the preservation of Aboriginal land rights. History NSWALC was founded in 1977 to assist in the protests by Aboriginal people for their land rights. It submitted ten land claims to the government from 1977 to 1981, the first being the Terry Hie Hie claim in northwestern NSW. The claims also called for compensation for the damage to their livelihood and loss of land. A Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly upon Aborigines was formed in November 1978, chaired by Maurice Keane. The select committee proposed the formation of an Aboriginal Heritage Commission charged with the protection of sacred sites. It also proposed the formation of a land rights system centered on local Community Councils, backed by Aboriginal Regional Land Councils, and finally an Aboriginal Land Development Commission. Governance and functions The NSWALC is an independent statutory corporation constituted under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (ALRA). Nine councillors, representing nine regional areas, are elected every four years. Its statutory functions include compliance with the regulations as well as financial management of New South Wales' network of land councils. There is an administrative section, overseen by a Chief Executive Officer. The head office is located in Parramatta, and there are five regional branch offices. Its mandate includes developing land rights among Aboriginal people in New South Wales, via its network of Local Aboriginal Land Councils, through land acquisition, by land claim or purchase, establishment of commercial businesses and community schemes to create an economic base for Aboriginal communities, as well as the continued passing and enhancement of Aboriginal culture, identity and heritage through the management of traditional sites and other cultural materials within NSW. The NSWALC's function includes advocacy for policies which benefit of the Aboriginal peoples of New South Wales, including representing them at the United Nations. Local Aboriginal Land Councils NSWALC oversees a network of 120 Local Aboriginal Land Councils (LALCs), split into nine regions. Cummeragunja Cummeragunja, in the Wiradjuri region, is owned and managed by the Cummeragunja Local Aboriginal Land Council, having taken over from the Yorta Yorta Local Aboriginal Land Council since ownership was passed to it in 1984. Advocacy After the new targets were announced by the federal government for its new Closing the Gap strategy, NSWALC chief executive James Christian said that the targets were not ambitious enough, in particular the justice goals.

Located in Berkeley, California, the Center has been organizing technical and cultural collaborations between Americans and citizens of the erstwhile Soviet Union. The Center has co-sponsored many energy conferences and seminars in Russia and Ukraine, has conducted training and grant programs in Kazakhstan and has organized study tours in the U.S. for environmental activists from those countries. Founders Enid Schreibman and Francis Underhill Macy cofounded the Center in 1995. They trained hundreds of activists in Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, and Kazakhstan to address the environmental legacy of the nuclear arms race and the Chernobyl disaster. Initiating scores of professional delegations and exchanges between Americans and their counterparts in the former Soviet Union in the areas of psychology, environment, and citizen organizing since 1983, the Center for Safe Energy empowered the rise of non- governmental organizations ‚Äì a strong contribution to the health of post- Soviet life. Macy was the first environmental director of Center for Citizen Initiatives. In 2005, he was awarded the Nuclear Free Future Lifetime Achievement Award. Schreibman, an experienced community organizer, has been leading professional exchanges to and from the former Soviet Union since 1986. She is an experienced trainer, organizational consultant and women's rights activist. Fieldwork CSE organizes two-way exchanges with partners on energy efficiency and climate change. It alternates between hosting experts from the former Soviet Union in the US to meet with their counterparts; and sending US experts to the former Soviet Union to exchange experience on safe energy strategies. The CSE also collaborates with partner NGO EcoForum Kazakhstan,http://www.uncsd2012.org/content/documents/940kazakhstan.pdf to arrange conferences and exchanges on energy, climate change, and cities.

His career was at its height during the 1960s and 1970s when he was busy with many important opera companies in the United States and had engagements in European opera houses. His career hit a slump in the early 1980s due to vocal difficulties, and afterwards his major engagements became less frequent. He taught on the voice faculty at the Boston Conservatory of Music and out of a private voice studio in Los Angeles. Life and career Born in New Orleans, Walker earned a Bachelor of Music degree from Occidental College in Los Angeles which he attended on a full vocal scholarship. He began his singing career as a member of the United States Army Chorus in 1957. He made his professional opera debut portraying Tom Rakewell in The Rake‚Äôs Progress at the Washington National Opera in 1959. He then became a soloist with the Robert Shaw Chorale, with whom he toured the United States performing the tenor solos in Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in B minor in 1960. He recorded the work under Robert Shaw's baton for the RCA Victor label. In 1960 Walker entered the Metropolitan Opera Studio, the Metropolitan Opera's school for young opera singers, where he was a pupil of George Schick and Cornelius Reid. That same year he sang Ferrando in Mozarts's Cos√¨ Fan Tutte at Lincoln Center for a performance attended by New York City public school children under the auspices of the Student Program of Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Opera Guild. In 1962 he made his debut at the San Francisco Opera (SFO) as Belmonte in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, and returned there the following year as Tamino in The Magic Flute. In 1963-1964 Walker was a resident artist at the Oldenburgisches Staatstheater. He then became a resident artist at the Cologne Opera from 1964-1966. Other contracts soon followed with such companies as the Cincinnati Opera, the Houston Grand Opera, the Lyric Opera of Kansas City, the Miami Opera, and the New Orleans Opera among others. In 1971 he created the role of Jonathan Gilourin in the world premiere of Dominick Argento‚Äôs Colonel Jonathan the Saint at the Denver Lyric Opera. In 1974 he was handpicked by Sir Georg Solti to sing the role of the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO). He returned twice more for performances with Solti and the CSO for performances of the Shepherd in Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex (1976) and Beethoven's Missa Solemnis (1977); the latter of which was recorded for London Records. In 1978 Walker made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1978, as Captain Vere in Billy Budd. He returned to the SFO in 1979 for performances in Death in Venice, La Fanciulla del West, and Gianni Schicchi. In the early 1980s his career hit a slump as he began to experience vocal difficulties. He took work anywhere he could get, including singing in opera choruses and as a church soloist. He attracted attention again at the Mostly Mozart Festival in 1984 when he replaced an ailing Jerry Hadley in the title role of Mozart's Idomeneo. Walker had been a member of the opera chorus and stepped in with less than a day's notice to very positive reviews in The New York Times. In 1985 he portrayed Kabuki in the world premiere of Minoru Miki‚Äôs Joruri at the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis. After this his performances with major companies were infrequent, although he remained active as a concert soloist, chorus singer and church singer until his death in 2014 at the age of 79. Some of the other roles Walker performed on stage during his career included Alfredo in La Traviata, Alwa in Lulu, Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni, Fenton in Verdi's Falstaff, Ferrando in Cos√¨ fan tutte, Nadir in Les p√™cheurs de perles, Rodolfo in La Boh√®me, and the title role in Albert Herring.

It has a hard chine line which permits planing when on a beam reach or when sailing downwind with spinnaker. The class was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Active fleets existed in the Finger Lakes Region (e.g. Cuyuga Lake, Skaneateles Lake), Pennsylvania, Ohio, the Midwest and even Florida.

It blended multiple influences ranging from psychedelia to baroque pop and folk rock, and was marked by eerie ballads and hard rock numbers. Much of the group's material was penned by the husband-wife songwriting duo of Scott and Vivian Holtzman, along with renditions of contemporary rock songs. The album was preceded by arguably Fever Tree's best known song, \\"San Francisco Girls (Return of the Native)\\", becoming the group's only nationally charting single. Like its attendant single, Fever Tree was also moderately successful and managed to reach number 156 on the Billboard 200. Background Fever Tree's first two singles became successful enough on a regional scale to convince record producing and songwriting duo, Scott and Vivian Holtzman, to secure a recording contract with Uni Records. Recording sessions commenced in January 1968 at Andrus Studios in Los Angeles after the group's relocation from Houston. With arrangements conducted by David Angel, who worked on the acclaimed Love album, Forever Changes, the recordings featured baroque and classical orchestration, and intricate horn instrumental patterns. The album is highlighted by the striking lead vocals of Dennis Keller, and the experimental keyboard textures arranged by Rob Landes. The eleven songs included on Fever Tree exhibit a wide array of styles, encompassing elements of hard rock and jazz on \\"Where Do You Go?\\", pop music on \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", folk rock, on the cover version of \\"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\\", and psychedelia throughout. In addition, the multi-sectioned structures and classical structures served as an indication toward Fever Tree's progressive rock experimentation that they would explore on their second album, Another Time, Another Place. The album's centerpiece is the group's only charting single, \\"San Francisco Girls (Return of the Native)\\". Written by the Holtzman duo, the composition made use of baroque pop-style harpsichord droning sustain guitar instrumentals, and somber percussion. The song saw heavy US airplay and managed to reach number 91 on the Billboard Hot 100. Fever Tree was released on March 28, 1968 and became a moderate hit when it charted at number 156 on the Billboard 200. In 1993, the album was rereleased on compact disc along with Fever Tree's second album, Another Time, Another Place on Collector's Choice Records. Additionally, the album was distributed on CD by Sundazed Records in 2009. Most of the material from Fever Tree is also featured on the 1986 compilation album, San Francisco Girls: The Best of Fever Tree. Track listing #\\"Imitation Situation 1 (Toccata and Fugue)\\" (J. S.

His art images result from digitally transforming his photographs to make them look painterly, subtly blurring the lines between photography and classical art. He often creates moving surreal images inspired by religious and mythological themes, using styles comparable to those of renowned modern painters like Gustav Klimt, John William Waterhouse and Ren√© Magritte. Dodd's art-work has been frequently cited and revised by many of his peers and specialized art websites. His work has been exhibited in many cities in the US and around the world, and made its way to inhabit important permanent public collections Career Thomas Dodd's father was an advanced amateur photographer of Irish ancestry, who taught his son the essentials of photography: composition, depth, lighting, and how to make quality portraits. Dodd in turn, learnt the basic techniques of a dark-room laboratory (such as negative development, enlarging, printing etc.) as part of his extra-curricular activity while attending Winter Park High School in Orange County, Florida. Dodd became interested in artistic photography through admiring Ansel Adam¬¥s prints at a gallery in Florida. Inspired by punk rock groups like the Sex Pistols and Ramones, Dodd learnt to play the guitar and spent the 1980s playing in punk rock bands in Florida and Atlanta. Soon after, Dodd became interested in Irish music and learnt to play the Celtic harp. In 1992 Dodd founded an ambient Celtic ensemble called Trio Nocturna, which had several sponsored appearances in New Orleans, Chicago and Atlanta. Trio Nocturna gained attention in the Gothic scene, recording three commercial albums named Morphia, Tears of Light and Songs of the Celtic Night. After Trio Nocturna disbanded in 1997, Dodd did session work as a harpist, most notably with Swans frontman Michael Gira on two albums: The Angels of Light's New Mother (1999) and The Body Lovers (2005). After a 25-year career as a professional musician, Dodd reemerged as a photographer in 2006, captivated by the popularization of Digital photography and image-processing software, on which he taught himself through online tutorials and books. Digital editing programs and the virtually limitless possibilities of photo-manipulation led Dodd back into photography as a vehicle of creative expression. Dodd's artistic photography has been praised by artist Richard T. Scott (video Artist Spotlight, min 24:00), and also has been the subject of several interviews and articles. Some of them have particularly focused on Dodd's inquiries in the treatment of light . Apart from his mainstream motifs, Dodd has been developing a novel aesthetic line in his series of nudist pictures All Bodies Are Beautiful. He is also developing a series of pieces depicting African American people. Dodd teaches his art through seminars, workshops and individual coaching. His work has had an acknowledged influence on Steampunk Neo-Victorian Fashion Exhibits and Collections Thomas Dodd has exhibited his visual art worldwide, including Germany, Romania,Argentina,New York City,M√©xico City,Orlando,Miami,San Antonio,Seattle,Par√≠s and Atlanta. Some recent solo and group exhibitions of Dodd's work include: *2015, Frankfurt (Germany), The Dream Factory *2015, Customs House Museum ‚Äì Tennessee, *2015, Washington (DC), Gallery NK *2014, Brukenthal Museum (Rumania), Exhibition: Darkness of Mexico *2014, Gallery One, Nashville(TN) *2013, Anarte Gallery, San Antonio(TX) Some of Dodd's works earned distinctions at recent exhibitions in New York City and New Orleans, where his work Ascension of the Magdalene is on permanent display at the International House Hotel. Dodd's work is also present in permanent collections at the Galerie L‚ÄôOeil du Prince in Paris, in the US at the New Britain Museum of American Art and at the Museo Arte Contemporaneo in Catania, Sicily . Technique Dodd has developed a unique technique that he calls painterly photo montage, where he employs software to blend and layer multiple photos together to create a final painterly image . The print resulting from this technique is often processed further with non-digital resources. Finished images are mounted on wood panels and then painted over with finishing gel or beeswax, a method called photo encaustic painting. When the image is printed again, it comes out bearing a seemingly tangible texture on top of the photographic composition. Dodd's work is said to be an organic composite of elements that always strive for the end result to be both beautiful and thought-provoking.

It is a collection of digitized, unedited videos which represent ethnographic research and its corresponding scholarly documentation. Collections gathered by EVIA Project include a diverse range of traditions from around the world. Overview The EVIA Digital Archive Project's central purpose is to create a repository of ethnographic video and a framework of tools and systems to support librarians, archivists, and scholars in ethnographic instruction. EVIA Project specifically focuses on topics such as anthropology, dance ethnology ethnomusicology, and folklore. The primary mission of EVIA Project is preserving ethnographic videos that were created by scholars while conducting their research. The secondary goal is to make the content generated by the project available with descriptive annotations, and ultimately, creating a distinct database for scholars, instructors, and students to refer to. History Funding for the Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive Project began in 2001 by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and further included contributions from Indiana University and University of Michigan. It was originally conceived as the ‚ÄúEthnomusicological Video for Instruction and Analysis Digital Archive‚Äù, but moved toward a broader ethnographic center that altered the meaning of its acronym. In 2001, the first formal efforts of Digital Archive Project surfaced as their initial planning phases began. Team members which included ethnomusicologists, intellectual property specialists, and digital and video technologists from Indiana University, the University of Michigan, Harvard University, and Ohio State University were all involved in planning workshops trying to resolve issues such as geographic coverage, technical challenges, and ethical issues surrounding the EVIA Project. At the end of the year, team members presented their proposal for the project to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and succeeded in receiving funding. In 2009, EVIA Project began working on moving away from their dependence on Mellon Foundation and move more toward a model of sustainability to generate income and financial support from users and institutions, as well as, acquire supplementary income from additional grants and subscription fees from individuals and institutions. Currently, EVIA Project‚Äôs work focuses on establishing markets for its products and services and developing efficient means to serve clientele. The archive EVIA Project utilizes both physical and digital storage systems. EVIA Project operates out of the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University, one of the oldest and largest university-based ethnographic sound archives in the United States. Physical tapes, whether they are a Digital Betacam preservation master or original copies, are maintained in a temperature and humidity- controlled vault of the Archives of Traditional Music. Digital files, whether they are the original recordings or preservation transfers from the original, are stored in Indiana University's Mass Data Storage System (MDSS). They are governed as a partnership between the Archives of Traditional Music, The EVIA Project, and the Digital Library Program at Indiana University. Any metadata gathered about the recordings as part of the EVIA deposition undertakings are maintained in a FEDORA archive generated by EVIA Project and maintained as part of the Digital Library Program at Indiana.

This procedure is most often utilized by chiropractors, as well as osteopathic physicians who practice osteopathic manipulation. This type of manipulation may increase the risk of stroke and other issues, with studies suggesting the relationship is causative. Location The cervical areas is located in the upper neck region of the spine from C1 to C7. Methods Many types of practitioners use various techniques to adjust the position of the cervical bones. They include bonesetters, physical therapists, chiropractors, non-physician osteopaths, and osteopathic physicians. The various techniques range from high velocity low amplitude thrusts to gentle positional release techniques such as Brett's Procedure. Risks There are associated risks that come with cervical manipulation including spinal disc herniation, stroke and vertebral artery dissection. Chances of stroke may be increased due to possible tears in neck arteries, known as cervical dissection, and is among the most common causes of stroke for young and middle-aged adults. However, it is difficult to quantify this risk, with a 2012 meta analysis of previous studies stating that a significant risk ‚Äúcan not be ruled out,‚Äù but noted that the true risk is possibly drastically underestimated, owing to the lack of a reporting requirement for private chiropractic practitioners.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. History Horace Anthony was a prominent citizen in 19th-century Camanche. He was born in Livingston County, New York in 1816, and married Elizabeth McCloskey in 1840 in Davenport, Iowa. Together they raised nine children. Anthony owned the saw mill and the lumber yard in town, and was one of Camanche's wealthiest citizens. He was influential in the founding of Camanche Baptist Church in 1851. Anthony built this house the following year and it remained in the family for 107 years. He was an abolitionist and his house served as a stop in the Underground Railroad. Anthony was also a staunch Republican and served in the Iowa House of Representatives from 1858 to 1860. He served as the Camanche Recorder Treasurer from 1863 to 1865. He then served on the Camanche Board of Supervisors from 1867 to 1868 and was its chairman in 1868. Anthony's son William joined him in the lumber business in 1859 when Horace became sick. The following year they had to rebuild the business after a tornado struck Camanche. The house was not damaged. A fire that caused $250,000 in 1893 destroyed most of the business and caused W.R. Anthony and Company to go out of business. Horace's son Frederick took over the title of the house when his father became ill. Elizabeth Anthony died in 1883 and Frederick died in 1888. Horace died on May 16, 1890. Frederick left the house to his wife Ella and their children Maude and Floyd. Floyd took possession of the house after his mother died in 1938. After his death his wife Agnes sold the house to LeRoy and Doris Goddard in 1958. Architecture The Horace Anthony House is a 2¬Ω-story brick dwelling built on a limestone foundation. The brick was locally produced. The main block is a cube-shape that measures roughly and it has a full basement. There is a single-story wing on the back, and a porch on the east side and one on the west side. Both the main block and the back wing are capped with a hipped roof. The main block has a flat deck on top of the roof. It also exhibits wide overhanging eaves with a bracketed cornice from the Italianate style. The pedimented hoods located over the windows and doors, and the main entry with its classical detailing and side lights and transom are characteristic of the Greek Revival style. The ceilings on the first floor are high. The two windows in the front of the house go from ceiling to floor. In the center of the main block is a spiral staircase that rises from the main floor to the roof deck. The house opens directly onto a city park rather than a street. The land for the park was donated to Camanche by Horace Anthony when he platted the land around 1852. The Anthony family mowed the grass in the park into the late 1940s. The city added the playground equipment in the 1970s.

He was raised in Billingham, County Durham, where he attended Stockton Secondary School, and went to St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1942. He won the Drury Prize in 1943 for his work in Mathematical Tripos. Career After graduation, with the Second World War still on-going, Stewartson began employment with the Ministry of Aircraft Production. During his time there he studied compressible fluid flow problems. After the war he returned to Cambridge and received the Mayhew Prize in 1946. He resumed research under the guidance of Leslie Howarth on boundary layer theory. His research led to his first publication, \\"Correlated incompressible and compressible boundary layers\\", which was published by the Royal Society in 1949. He received his doctorate the same year and became a lecturer at Bristol University in 1950. In 1953 he went to the United States to become a lecturer at the California Institute of Technology for a year before returning to Bristol University.

In his time there, he studied rotating fluid flows, shear layers, magnetohydrodynamics, triple-deck theory, and Reynolds number. He played major role in the founding of Institute of Mathematics and its Applications along with James Lighthill.https://ima.org.uk/about-us/history/origins-of-the-institute/ In his career he authored 186 papers.

Located in Sardis, BC, on the territory of the St√≥:l≈ç peoples, the hospital was converted from the Coqualeetza Institute residential school and officially opened on September 2, 1941. It was initially operated by the Department of Mines and Resources' Indian Affairs branch, but was taken over in 1946 by the newly created Department of National Health and Welfare. On November 19, 1948 a fire broke out at the hospital, which newspapers claim destroyed nearly two-thirds of the building's structure. The following year, numerous Members of Parliament in BC's interior lobbied to have the institution moved to their respective home towns. However, the hospital remained in Sardis and by 1957 it was \\"the only fully accredited hospital in the Fraser Valley.\\" The hospital closed on September 30, 1969 amidst claims that \\"modern drug usage and detection techniques\\" had brought tuberculosis under control and that \\"any continuation of Indian Hospitals would only lead to further segregation\\" of non-Indigenous settlers and BC's Indigenous peoples.  Significance  In 1943, it was claimed that Coqualeetza accounted for just over 21 percent of the country's in-patient tubercular care for Indigenous peoples. Largely due to the implementation of occupational programming for patients, the Chilliwack Progress claimed in 1946 that Coqualeetza was \\"the first complete tuberculosis unit of its kind ... in Canada[.]\\" The site is now used by St√≥:l≈ç Nation.

The film stars Andrew Scott, Rafe Spall, Kelly Macdonald, Jessica Hynes, and Harry Enfield. Principal photography began on 21 June 2015 in the Lake District. The film, which was released on 19 August 2016, is the third audiovisual adaption of the novel; the first being a 6-part BBC TV series in 1963 and the second a 1974 film version. Synopsis The film is based on Ransome's book, but the script incorporates many changes to the plot. It chronicles the story of the Walker children on their holiday in the Lake District in the summer of 1935. They want to camp on an island in the lake. When they get there in the boat Swallow, they soon discover they are not alone. Two other children, the Blacketts, also known as the \\"Amazons\\", have set up camp there, and a battle for the island begins. But with Britain on the brink of war and a \\"secret agent\\" looking for the Blackett children's uncle, they have a series of adventures quite different from their plans. Cast * Rafe Spall as Jim Turner / \\"Captain Flint\\", the uncle of the Blackett children * Andrew Scott as Lazlow, a \\"secret agent\\" looking for Jim Turner * Kelly Macdonald as Mrs Walker, the mother of the Walker children * Jessica Hynes as Mrs Jackson, the wife of Mr Jackson * Harry Enfield as Mr Jackson * Dane Hughes as John Walker * Orla Hill as Susan Walker * Teddie-Rose Malleson-Allen as Tatty Walker * Bobby McCulloch as Roger Walker * Seren Hawkes as Nancy Blackett * Hannah Jayne Thorp as Peggy Blackett Production Principal photography on the film began on 21 June 2015 in the Lake District, North West England. The film was also shot in Yorkshire, at Plumpton Rocks parkland near Harrogate (the location for 'Wild Cat Island') Arts correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, Hannah Furness, observed, > \\"The original Swallows and Amazons saw its intrepid children battling the > perilous waters of the Lake District summer, a grumpy uncle and, > occasionally, one another. The 2016 update, a BBC film of the same name, > will add one further foe to that list: gun-toting Russian spies in their > midst. The tweaks to the film were inspired by the real life of author > Arthur Ransome, who is now known to have been an MI6 spy. At one point, > papers in the National Archive reveal, he was under suspicion of being a > double agent for Russia. The film plot will use his story as the inspiration > for the character of Jim Turner, always thought to have been partially based > on the writer himself.\\" The music was composed by Ilan Eshkeri. Critical reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film received a rating of 94%, based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. On Metacritic the film received a score of 65 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Writing in the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, Lewis Jones noted that Arthur Ransome had written in his diary \\"Saw the ghastly mess they have made of poor old Swallows and Amazons\\" after watching the BBC's 1962 series. Jones added, \\"I think he might have liked Philippa Lowthorpe's forthcoming film, though, which is true to the spirit of his book, and so attentive to period detail that at one point Mrs Walker smokes a cigarette\\". Jones outlined the film's changes to the book's character Jim Turner, writing: \\"In the film he is engaged in espionage and pursued by Russian agents, which gives the story some grown-up oomph, and pays fitting tribute to the author's wildly adventurous early life. For Ransome was not merely a boaty old buffer with a walrus moustache who wrote children's books. As a young journalist he reported on the Russian Revolution, was on intimate terms with its leaders and was himself an active player, which led to his recruitment by MI6.\\" For Alistair Harkness, writing in The Scotsman, the film \\"serves as a gentle reminder of the value of allowing children to get outside and explore instead of being mollycoddled by fearful parents\\". He added: \\"The film adds an espionage subplot that feels a little underpowered to really provide the intended narrative oomph, danger or excitement, but in an age in which the teen heroes and heroines of YA adaptations are routinely given ridiculously proficient combat skills, there's something nice about watching kids mucking about and learning basic wilderness skills.\\" Geoffrey Macnab in The Independent began by saying: \\"This new adaptation of Arthur Ransome's novel evokes a long-lost era in which kids didn't just spend their days searching for Pok√©mon or playing Call Of Duty. Instead, they had rip-roaring adventures in sailing boats and camped on remote islands.\\" He found the \\"loving Hovis-ad fashion, complete with tweed caps, cardigans and idyllic villages that always seem to be full of bunting\\" of the filming to be evocative but was less impressed that \\"[f]or no apparent reason, the filmmakers have grafted on a John Buchan/Alfred Hitchcock-style spy story to proceedings\\". Macnab concluded, \\"The film is at its best when the adults are kept at bay. [It] really takes wing [‚Ä¶] when the Swallows and Amazons are trying to steal each other's boats, making expeditions by moonlight or are planning just what they're going to eat after dropping their provisions in the lake.\\" Trevor Johnston in the Radio Times opined: \\"For today's children, this fresh adaptation of Arthur Ransome's classic Lake District tale must seem as if it's taking place on some distant planet. The brothers and sisters here are allowed to take their dinghy to the waters by themselves and even stay overnight on the island at its middle. They gut fish for dinner, navigate their way round the shores, and even find themselves in a territorial dispute with some cunning local rivals. Not a smartphone or tablet in sight, no social media updates, and no sign of an app to light a campfire when the matches have gone astray.\\" He too remarked on the changes to the plot, deciding: \\"With more at stake, the drama is intensified, as director Philippa Lowthorpe [‚Ä¶] gives everything hands-on credibility while still retaining the nostalgic appeal of bygone days [and] also works brilliantly with the junior cast.\\" Johnston concluded that \\"All in all, it's an intelligent, involving, beautifully mounted adaptation of material that might easily have seemed an old-fashioned relic. And the grey, blustery Lake District weather could hardly be more British.\\" References External links  2016 films 2010s adventure drama films British adventure drama films British films British children's adventure films English-language films Films based on British novels Films set in the 1930s Films set in 1935 Films set in Cumbria Films set on islands Film 2010s children's adventure films 2016 directorial debut films 2016 drama films ","title":"Swallows and Amazons (2016 film)"},{"id":"47124695","text":"Brendan Joel McKay (born December 18, 1995) is an American professional baseball pitcher and designated hitter for the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball (MLB).

He is the first Member of Parliament (MP) in Kenya with Albinism. He belongs to Jubilee Party. Previously he was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the National Assembly (between 2013 and 2017) after having been nominated by the Orange Democratic Movement Party to represents Special Interest Groups. Mwaura served as a Senior Adviser to former Prime Minister Raila Odinga from 2010 to 2012 on Public Policy on Special Interest Groups. Mwaura hails and lives in Kiambu county. He has a bachelor's degree in Special Education, French Studies and Japanese from Kenyatta University. Additionally, he has two master's degrees; Masters in Arts in Development Studies from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (South Africa) and Masters in Arts in Social and Public Policy Studies from University of Leeds (United Kingdom) Mwaura has distinguished himself as a brilliant debater, both in Parliament and on the media and has been rated as one of the best performing Members of Parliament. He is fluent in English, French, Swahili and Kikuyu and is an author of the book: A Discourse of Human Rights, Disability and Development in Kenya (2009). He is married to Nelius Mukami Mwaura and has one son, Njiru Mwaura. Early life and Education Mwaura was born in Githunguri, Kiambu County in 1982 and was solely raised by his mother, Grace Mwaura, after his father disowned him and divorced Grace after Mwaura was born with albinism. The deserted family relocated to Mwaura's maternal grandmother where he and his elder brother grew up. \\"My father said very nasty things to my mother and declared that in his family they don't get such kids. He even accused her of being unfaithful, and that she had conceived me with some somebody of Causian or Asian origin.\\" Mwaura said in 2014 in a media interview. Although he grew in abundant love and protection from his mother and relatives, Mwaura faced prejudice and discrimination from the neighborhood. He was rebuked for his albinism and derogatory comments made about his appearance. Many ignorantly attributed his albinism as having caused by severe burns from hot water, and opined that a total blood transfusion could reverse his disability. Despite recommendations from the neighbours for Mwaura to be trained to do menial tasks since he 'couldn't amount to much, anyway', Mwaura's mother disregarded the suggestion and instead enrolled him to Thika School for the Blind, a special national school that admitted pupils with visual impairment and albinism, so as he could get formal education. Mwaura went through schooling and emerged the top pupil in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) in his school in 1996. He won a slot in Starehe Boys' Centre, a prestigious and the top-performing school in Nairobi, but instead he opted for Thika High School of Blind which he joined in 1997. While at high school, Mwaura became the school's head boy, an opportunity that enhanced his leadership skills. After completing his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in 2000, Mwaura joined Kenyatta University in 2002 for a bachelor's degree in Special Education, French Studies and Japanese and completed in 2006. He further pursued and completed a Post-graduate diploma in Public Relations Management in Kenya Institute of Management and a Diploma in Theology in Presbyterian University of East Africa. Between 2010 and 2012, Mwaura enrolled and graduated with two master's degree: Master's Degree in Social and Public Policy as a Ford Scholar from University of Leeds in United Kingdom and Masters in Arts in Development Studies from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in South Africa. In 2016, Mwaura was conferred with an honorary Doctor of Philosophy in Humanities (Honoris Causa) from UGCI- USA for his immeasurable contribution in serving the marginalized and minorities in Kenya.  Career and achievements   Working for Disabled Persons Organisations and civil societies  Mwaura has worked in different organisations, both nationally and internationally. In 2004, while still a university student and aged 22 years, Mwaura was appointed as a board director to the National Council for the Persons with Disabilities, making him the first youngest board member in Kenya. After graduating from Kenyatta University in 2006, Mwaura worked as a Regional Programme Coordinator (Gender and Youth Development) with African Union of the Blind as well as a Programme Officer and Programme Manager with United Disabled People of Kenya and Kenya Society for the Blind respectively. He then joined National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPWD) as the Head of Communications and Public Relations before rising to the position of Deputy Director of Programmes in the same state agency. He left the council in 2007 and joined Uraia Trust Civic Education Programme as a programme Officer in charge of the National Civic Education Programme. Mwaura joined Voluntary Services Overseas and worked as a Programme Development Advisor on Human Rights Based Approach in Papua New Guinea before jetting back to Kenya to work as a Senior Adviser on Special Interest Groups to the former Prime Minister of Kenya Raila Odinga.  His role as a student leader  Mwaura was an activist as early as a freshman at Kenyatta University when he organised a strike against a Non-governmental organisation that was exploiting visually impaired students at the university. Subsequently, he and others successfully lobbied the Joint Admission Board of Kenya to admit students with special needs who had met the minimum required grade for university placement. While still a freshman at Kenyatta University, Mwaura was elected as a student leader and joined hands with other leaders including the current Homa Bay Women Representative Gladys Wanga to oust the then Vice-Chancellor Professor George Eshiwani out of office for he was serving an illegal term. During his tenure as a student leader, Mwaura is credited for coordinating the review of students' union constitution, transforming it from an archaic one to a more vibrant and inclusive document.  Albinism Society of Kenya  In 2006, Mwaura and other persons with albinism in Kenya founded Albinism Society of Kenya (ASK), a national organisation that brings together persons with albinism in Kenya and whose mission is to create awareness on the rights of persons with albinism, their social inclusion, empowerment and equity to socio-economic opportunities. Mwaura articulated the objective of ASK: \\"We wanted to share and celebrate our differences and uniqueness as persons with albinism and lobby the government to fund the national development fund for persons with albinism.‚Äù Mwaura is the National Coordinator and the Chairman of Albinism Society of Kenya, and through his stewardship, the organisation has made significant milestones in rescuing persons with albinism from ritual killings as well as creating job opportunities and economic empowerment for persons with albinism in Kenya. Additionally, the organisation has been involved in policy and legislative advocacy, albinism awareness, eye-care and sunscreen programme, education support, counselling programme and cancer treatment intervention for persons with albinism . Through ASK, persons with albinism in Kenya are provided with free sunscreen lotions, prescription glasses and protective clothing in order to shield them from harmful solar radiation. Also to note, more than 30 hospitals in Kenya have been equipped with cryotherapy equipment in order to assist in mitigation of skin cancer, and a special fund has been set aside to meet medical expenses of skin cancer sufferers with albinism. Other key achievements ASK is proud of is the appointment of Mumbi Ngugi, a woman with albinism, as the Judge of High Court in Kenya and emergence of Goldalyn Kakuya, a girl with albinism, as the best student in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in Kenya in 2017 after scoring 455 marks out of 500. Mwaura has mentored young persons with albinism, including Martin Pepela Wanyonyi, an elected Member of County Assembly (MCA) for Ndivisi Ward in Bungoma county, and Timothy Aseke who is a nominated MCA in Kakamega county.  Campaigns against killings of persons with albinism  Mwaura has led sustained campaigns against stigmatization, discrimination, violence and persecution of persons with albinism in Kenya and East Africa. Mwaura attributes this plight facing persons with albinism to ignorance, myths and superstitions surrounding albinism. Fallacies and misconceived ideas about promise of wealth, health and success have led to kidnapping, trafficking and brutal murder of innocent men, women and children. ‚ÄúThe threat to persons with albinism in Kenya, and East Africa is very real,\\" said Mwaura in 2015 after rescuing Robinson Mukwana, a young male Kenyan with albinism who had been lured to Tanzania on the promise of a job only to be presented to willing buyers. Mwaura, who adopted and educates two young children with albinism - Bianca Chacha and Gabriel Kinyanjui - who had been abducted for ritual killings in 2016 but salvaged, appealed to the East Africa Community. \\"The heads of state from East Africa should come up with a policy statement on the plight of persons with albinism in the region which has reached alarming levels.\\" Mwaura says that persons with albinism continue to face threats of their lives. Over 600 persons with albinism have been ritually killed in Africa, with Tanzania leading with 76 reported deaths. In August 2019, a teenage boy with albinism was killed and his body mutilated in Burundi, while in South Africa, a 40-year old teacher in August 2019 admitted guilt to kidnapping and killing a 13-year-old girl with albinism, Gabisile Shabane, for ritual purposes. Mwaura has associated these killings to election cycles or drought and famine in Africa. Mwaura, in a press conference in Nairobi on 24 August 2019 apportioned blame to heads of state in Africa for their passivity and failure in safeguarding rights and freedoms of persons with albinism. Mwaura asked, \\"How comes that Africa, which suffered from many years of slavery, is the same that is leading in the killings of Persons with Albinism and discrimination based on skin colour?\\"  Mr and Miss Albinism East Africa pageantry  In 2018, Mwaura through ASK, organised the first ever Mr and Miss Albinism East Africa pageantry in Nairobi with its theme 'Beauty Beyond the Skin'. The contest which aimed at showcasing talents of youth with albinism and to combat stigma and discrimination, brought together 30 contestants drawn form Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.  Mwaura's parliamentary achievements  At parliament level where he is a Senator, Mwaura has successfully championed for the increase in budget allocation to National Council for Persons with Disabilities, as well as inclusion of youth with disabilities to the National Youth Service. Besides advocating for persons with disabilities to be appointed to various constitutional commissions and government agencies, Mwaura has ensured an establishment of an isolated budget to cater for free sunscreen lotions skin cancer treatment and eye-care services for persons with albinism. Mwaura is the pioneer and the founding chair of Kenya Disability Parliamentary Association (KEDIPA), a caucus of Members of Parliament with disabilities in Kenya. Furthermore, Mwaura in 2018 petitioned Central Bank of Kenya to ensure the new currency is accessible to persons with visual impairments, which was adopted and implemented. Also, Mwaura successfully lobbied and pushed amendments to the law to have persons with albinism captured in the 2019 Census in Kenya as well as enumeration of intersex persons.  Awards and honours  In 2016, Mwaura was honoured with the First Class: Chief of the Burning Spear (CBS) by Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta for his immense disability advocacy and parliamentary achievement. Similarly, in 2019, Mwaura was feted during the United Nation's 40th Human Rights Council Convention in Geneva, Switzerland for his efforts in fighting for the rights of persons with albinism in Kenya.  In My Genes  Mwaura featured in In My Genes, a Kenyan 2009 documentary film that was directed, written, produced and edited by the award-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o in her directing debut. The documentary, where Mwaura acted as an aspiring politician (a screen dream that he has fulfilled), highlights the plight of persons with albinism. Mwaura had met Lupita in 2006, and through this encounter, she introduced him to her father, Professor Peter Anyang' Nyong'o, the governor of Kisumu County, who later became his political mentor and the first patron of Albinism Society of Kenya.  Albinism as a Disability and Clamour for Identity  Mwaura was born with Albinism, a genetic condition that causes the skin, hair and eyes to have little or no melanin pigment. Albinism is also associated with vision problems, and apparent lack of pigmentation makes persons with albinism susceptible to sunburn and skin cancers. Albinism is non-contagious condition that results from biological inheritance of genetically recessive alleles (genes) from both parents and it is characterised by the absence of tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in the production of melanin. Albinism is present within all ethnic groups and populations worldwide, but prevalence rates are particularly high in Africa. Persons with albinism often face social and cultural challenges (including threats), as the condition is often a source of ridicule, discrimination, or even fear and violence. In most African states, persons with albinism are socially stigmatised and less likely to complete schooling, find employment, and find partners. The majority of people with albinism in East Africa live in marginalized social conditions and in a state of economic vulnerability because, apart from having a different physical appearance and suffering from visual impairments, they cannot actively take part in agricultural work due to their sensitivity to the sun, and this effectively excludes them from engaging in the major productive activity in most rural areas. In African countries such as Tanzania and Burundi, there has been unprecedented rise in witchcraft- related killings of people with albinism in recent years, because their bodies are used in portions sold by witch doctors. Another harmful and false belief is that having sexual intercourse with women with albinism can cure a man of HIV. This has led to rapes and subsequent HIV infection. Mwaura points prejudice and superstition about albinism as the most prevalent challenge that persons with albinism experience: ‚ÄúYou find people don't want to shake your hand ‚Äì they think albinism is contagious,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúand people don't realise when they are doing it, but I can notice. They shake your hand, then they kind of try to wipe it off.‚Äù Mwaura also observes that persons with albinism in Africa lack a true identity as 'they are neither black nor white enough.' Mwaura said in 2019, \\"We continue to suffer from 'in betweenness' - white but not white enough, black but not black enough, disabled but not disabled enough.\\" Derogatory labels such as zeruzeru (meaning ghost), nguruwe (pig) and dili (which literally means ‚Äòdeal‚Äô, and refers to the trade of the body parts of people with albinism on the black market) are used to refer to persons with albinism in East Africa while among the Yoruba and Hausa of Nigeria they are referred to as Afin or eni-orisa (one who belongs to the deity) and Bature-Ntuda, meaning fake white person respectively. Organisations such as Albinism Society of Kenya (ASK) have been established to create awareness about albinism and to fight for all forms of discrimination and persecution targeting persons with albinism. A 2009 Kenyan documentary, In My Genes, directed and produced by Lupita Nyong'o, communicates strongly the plight of persons with albinism. Though the definition of albinism as a disability in Kenya is within the implicit scope of 'visual and physical impairment...' (Persons with Disabilities Act, 2003), Mwaura in his capacity as a Member of Parliament (MP) has come up with an amendment to the Act (The Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2019) to secure a distinct and explicit identity of albinism as disability in the law. Mwaura in 2014 stated that persons with albinism in Kenya used the ambiguities in law to fight for recognition and their rights as citizens and pointed that the state ought to recognise threats to their lives as an infringement of their rights and grant them protection. Although Mwaura and Albinism Society of Kenya have successfully lobbied for a state-funded national sunscreen distribution programme for all registered persons with albinism in Kenya, the programme's current success and future sustenance seems dependent on the presentation of albinism as a disability, both in physiological as well as legal terms. Pushing for the political recognition of people with albinism, both as individuals with a disability and at the same time as persons who should be fully included in society (through inclusive education and equal job market opportunities), is one of the positions that Mwaura and organisations such as Albinism Society of Kenya are carrying forward. Forums such as International Albinism Awareness Day and Mr and Miss Albinism East Africa pageantry have strengthened the group identity of persons with albinism. Also, United Nations has ensured inclusion of albinism agenda in their human rights framework by appointing Ms. Ikponwosa Ero, a woman with albinism, as the first Independent Expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism. The mandate of this office includes raising awareness on the rights of persons with albinism and to combat stereotypes, prejudices and harmful traditional practices and beliefs that hinder their enjoyment of human rights and participation in society on equal basis with others, among other functions. In 2019, Mwaura led a team of Africans with Albinism to the Africa Union's Council of Ministers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where Africa Union Action Plan on Albinism was adopted and a position of a Special Envoy on Albinism established. In addition, political representation, including nomination of Mwaura as a Senator representing Persons with Disabilities in the Parliament has offered persons with albinism an enormous leverage to vouch for a distinct identity in law and in the society. Finally, availability of data is seen as important approach to strengthening identity of persons with albinism. Many countries in Africa are yet to have official data on persons with albinism. Only in Malawi in 2018 that enumerated and published figures of persons with albinism at 134,000 against a previously estimated figure of 17,000. This case in Malawi indicates there could be a higher prevalence of persons with albinism globally and more so in Africa. Albinism Society of Kenya estimates a figure of between 10,000 and 30,000 persons with albinism in Kenya, but these figures are unverifiable until census with enumeration of persons with albinism is conducted. In his capacity as a Senator for Persons with Albinism, Mwaura has pushed for the inclusion of persons with albinism in 2019 Kenya Census. Political career  Early political career  Mwaura's political career commenced in Kenyatta University where he was elected as a student leader in 2002 when he was a freshman. Through this position, he joined hands with other elected student leaders and lecturers to lobby the President Mwai Kibaki's Narc government to grant amnesty and readmit university students who had been expelled during the President Daniel arap Moi's regime. Subsequently, he and other leaders organised a major strike that ousted the Vice-Chancellor Professor George Eshiwani who was serving an illegal term at Kenyatta University.  Mwaura as a Special Adviser and a Nominated Member of Parliament  After completing his undergraduate course at Kenyatta University, Mwaura joined Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party as a member in 2006 and rose ranks to become the Secretary of Disability Affairs. During 2007 Kenya's General election, Mwaura was instrumental in mobilizing voters with disabilities and campaigning for the ODM presidential candidate Raila Odinga. After the 2007-2008 Kenyan crisis that resulted in the formation of Government of National Unity with Mwai Kibaki as a President and Raila Odinga as a Prime Minister, Mwaura was appointed as a Senior Adviser on Special Interest Groups in the Prime Minister's office and served from 2010 to 2012. In 2013, Mwaura was nominated by Orange Democratic Movement as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the Kenya's National Assembly to represent Special Interest Groups and he made history as the first Member of Parliament with albinism in Kenya.  2014 Men-in-Black incident  However, Mwaura courted attention and controversy in February 2014 during the Orange Democratic Movement party National Delegates Convention in Kasarani Gymnasium in Nairobi during the election of party officials. The voting was proceeding on peacefully until when Mwaura sprang to a table to protest against omission of his name from ballot papers. Chaos erupted and an ambush of mafia-like men in black suits, infamously referred as 'men-in-black', stormed the gymnasium and destroyed ballot papers and boxes. Delegates scampered out of the hall and the voting ended abruptly.  Participation as an aspirant for Ruiru Constituency and alleged assassination attempt  In 2016, Mwaura ditched Orange Democratic Movement party and joined Jubilee Party. In April 2017, he participated in Jubilee Party primaries as a candidate for Ruiru Constituency Parliamentary seat where he was politically nicknamed as 'Muthungu wa Ruiru' or the white man from Ruiru, but did not secure the party nomination. Mwaura termed primaries as 'not credible' as the party primaries across the country were marred with disorganization, rigging, voter bribery, violence and chaos. Two days before the primaries, Mwaura and his political competitor Simon King'ara had been involved in altercation when Mwaura went to stop demolition of a motor bike shade he had constructed. Chaos ensued and gun shots rang in the air, leaving Mwaura with an injury on his ear. Mwaura immediately reported it as an assassination attempt and that a bullet had grazed his ear. Nevertheless, Mwaura conceded defeat, stating that his political debut had 'helped fight stigma and discrimination, break glass ceiling, push the awareness and inclusion agenda forward, and inspire many other people in Kenya and beyond to stand up and be counted.\\"  Mwaura's nomination as a Senator to represents Persons with Disabilities  Mwaura thereafter joined Uhuru Kenyatta's presidential campaign team as one of the chief campaigners and a strategist. He was nominated as a Senator by Jubilee Party in 2017 to represent Persons with Disabilities in the Senate.  Harassment and discrimination by Secret Service agents in New York in September 2019  On a Facebook post, Mwaura reported about being harassed and discriminated by virtue of his albinism by the Secret Service agents during a UN General Assembly forum in New York in September, 2019. ‚ÄúI get into the building and check in at the security. I do the usual stuff of emptying my pockets, then I go through the machine and they do a body search. Then I'm told to step aside and I am kept waiting for over thirty minutes. The Secret Service agents ask for my ID and by this time, they have picked my entry card.‚Äù Mwaura was informed by the Secret Service that they looking for someone who fitted his description and who was walking around with a screwdriver. Mwaura wondered, ‚ÄòIn the US, people are allowed to own and carry guns, and here we are talking about a screwdriver?‚Äô Mwaura was again to suffer more humiliation in the same event as he was initially denied access to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta and other colleagues at Hotel Latte. ‚ÄòThe Secret Service takes my card again while others start taking photos of me secretly with their phones...‚Äô Even with Mwaura‚Äôs colleagues explaining that Mwaura was a senator from Kenya, the Secret Service still followed him into the lift while looking at him suspiciously. Mwaura then suffered the same treatment as he was denied access to his hotel room despite providing his UN accreditation. Mwaura said he could not endure the harassment any further and reminded a secret service agent he was ‚Äòa person of colour‚Äô and a senator from Kenya when he inquired if Mwaura was a US senator. Later, US Ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter offered apologies to Mwaura for the incidences.

Barefoot has two retail stores in Colombo and one store in Galle. History In 1964, Barbara Sansoni, a colourist, artist and textile designer, at the suggestion of an Irish nun, Sister Good Counsel of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, to become involved in a programme established by the convent in Wattala that taught young impoverished Sri Lanka women how to weave. Sansoni with her then husband, Hildon, established and financed four village weaving centres. Sansoni's initial involvement mainly related to the design aesthetics of the material being produced. Sansoni then began to sell the weaver's products from her home. Barefoot currently has five weaving centres in Sri Lanka, run by the weavers, using designs by Sansoni and the Barefoot design team. The company's flagship store, on Galle Road in Colombo, which opened in the early 1970s, is housed in a collection of buildings, centred on an old 1920s town house. The store, which sells Barefoot goods and a wide range of selected local products, also includes a bookshop, a caf√© and an art gallery. The art gallery at the rear of the building, was previously known as the Colombo Gallery between 1967 and 1971. It was reopened in 1991 as Gallery 706 Colombo and in 1999 was renamed to its current name, Barefoot Art Gallery. Barefoot also has a smaller store located in Galle Fort (opened in 2004) and in the Old Colombo Dutch Hospital complex (opened in 2011). Barefoot products are available from selected retailers in Australia, France, Japan, the Maldives, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the US and the UK.

She made two voyages transporting convicts from Bengal and Mauritius to Australia. She disappeared c.1832 while on a whaling voyage. Career Queen Charlotte was built by Robert Campbell in Sydney, New South Wales. Captain James Birnie facilitated the completion of Queen Charlotte, which had been on the stocks. She was launched at the end of January 1813. Birnie fitted her out and she sailed for the fisheries. Towards autumn Queen Charlotte was under the command of Captain Shelly (or Shelley), a former missionary at Tongatapu and Matavai. When she reached Eimeo he took on board several men from Raiatea and Tahiti to fish for pearls in the Paumoto Islands. Shortly after she reached the islands and started pearl fishing, the divers attacked the British crew, killing the first and second mates. At this the other crew members jumped overboard and reached shore. Two of the Tahitians onboard protected Shelley, arguing that they wished to return to Tahiti and that they would need him to navigate. When Queen Charlotte reached Tahiti the local chief restored her to Mr. Shelly, as well as most of what the Raiateans had plundered. Shelly then sailed her back to Port Jackson. Queen Charlotte returned in February 1814 with 70 tons of pearl shell. As late as 1819 James Birnie refused to hire Queen Charlotte out to Campbell until Campbell settled his accounts. In 1820 Birnie sold Queen Charlotte to Messrs. Campbell, Jr. and Emmett. Queen Charlotte entered Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1827 with J. Maughan, master, Campbell, owner, and trade London‚ÄìNew South Wales. It also gave her build year as 1819.LR (1827), Supple. pages \\"Q\\", Seq.‚ÑñQ3.

On 27 May 1831, as Queen Charlotte was arriving at Norfolk Island, her master, Captain Rennoldson accidentally set off a musket belonging to a guard escorting the prisoners she was carrying. The musket sent a ball through Rennoldson's thigh, shattering a bone. He was got on shore, but died some days later. On 17 June Queen Charlotte sailed on to New Zealand.Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (9 August 1831), p. 2, \\"NORFOLK ISLAND\\".

Described as an ‚Äúintuitive baroque‚Äù or Art Brut style of building, dos Santos constructed and decorated the house throughout the decades of his life, only ceasing when he died. To build and ornament the house, dos Santos gathered scraps and bits of trash - ceramic, china, tile fragments, broken lamps, knickknacks, shells, chains, fenders, headlights, splintered windows, smashed bottles, broken dishes, bits of old iron, chair legs, wheels, and metal lids - from nearby Cabo Fr√≠o.

They were first popularized by Carolyn Graham in the 1980s.  Concept  Jazz Chant is a rhythmic expression of natural language which links the rhythms of spoken American English to the rhythms of traditional American jazz. Jazz Chants are defined poems with repeated beats. The beat may vary depending on the idea of the reader A jazz chant is a fragment of authentic language presented with special attention to its natural rhythm. It is important to remember that jazz chanting is not like rapping, nursery rhymes, or songs, which distort the spoken language for poetic effect. The rhythms, stress and intonation pattern of the chant should be an exact replica of what the student would hear from an educated native speaker in natural conversation. Echols (1996:327) states that chant means simple and short songs. So Jazz Chants is the technique to practice the English utterances in short jazz beats that is easy to be followed by the students. As we know that the teaching and learning process is a complex phenomenon that involves many components and competencies, including words, mind, and our action. Through attractive learning, the learning process can be effective. The jazz chants model is a way to build an effective learning. The implementation of jazz chants is suitable with the principle of quantum teaching in classrooms that drives students in a happy atmosphere while learning. Implementation of Chant Jazz model, this is included in the effort of practicing Quantum Teaching in Class. Quantum Teaching is a fun learning composition with all the interactions and differences that maximize learning moments. The focus is on dynamic relationships within the classroom environment, the interaction that provides the foundation and framework for learning (De Porter, 2003) Implementation 1. Students are grouped into two groups 2. At the preparatory stage the teacher records the responses of English utterances that cannot be uttered by the students. 3. As a tool, teachers use tape recorders to play jazz chant examples. 4. In this period, the teacher emphasizes the primary tense and simple present tense. To improve students 'speaking ability in reading aloud (students' reading is recorded one = aloud) especially vocal sounds (a, e and u). Broadly speaking students are given a drill of some chant models with certain dominant sounds. After practice chant, tested the ability of students in uttering certain voiced words by reading a simple sentence loud. For the accuracy of the data, students' voices are recorded one by one. The assessment is done simply by counting the correct number and wrong of each student Carolyn Graham developed the technique of jazz chanting during her twenty-five years of teaching ESL in the American Language Institute of New York University. Throughout the ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s Graham‚Äôs jazz chants spread far and wide along with the ESL teaching methods and techniques. Graham published a number of books, tape recordings and CDs on her method mainly by Oxford University Press. The series of computer programs Languages with Music is the first software based on Jazz Chants ideas. Jazz Chants appeal to students of all ages, and work with large classes, and stimulate pairwork and role-playing activities. Jazz chants improve the students‚Äô speaking competence in terms of pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension. Jazz chants help students sound more natural when they speak English. Today jazz chants can be heard in ESL and EFL classrooms around the world.

Aly is the first female federal parliamentarian of Muslim faith. Aly was a professor, lecturer and academic specialising in counter-terrorism, and she is considered a global authority on understanding how and why young people are drawn into violent extremism. Aly founded People Against Violent Extremism (PaVE) to address extremism in Australia. Early life and education Aly was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1967. Her mother was a nurse and her father an engineer. When Aly was two years old she and her parents moved to Australia via an assisted migration program, living first in Queensland, before settling in the western Sydney suburbs Lakemba and Chipping Norton, where Aly attended a private Anglican girls' school, Meriden, and her parents worked in factories and as a bus driver. Aly returned to Egypt for university, then returned to Australia with her first husband to raise their children in Perth close to her retired parents. Aly graduated from the American University in Cairo in 1990 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with high honours in English Literature, with a minor in Acting; and in 1994, received a Graduate Diploma of Arts (Language Studies) from Edith Cowan University; followed by a Master of Education degree in 1996, and PhD in 2008, both from Edith Cowan University. Her PhD thesis focused on media and culture, and was entitled A study of audience responses to the media discourse about the 'Other': The Fear of Terrorism between Australian Muslims and the Broader Community. Early career While studying, Aly worked part-time teaching English to migrants. In 2001 Aly became a policy officer for the Government of Western Australia, where she worked in education and multicultural affairs policy from 2000 to 2007, including as a senior policy officer in the Office of Multicultural Interests from 2003. After the 9/11 attacks she worked on Western Australia's response to the Federal Government's counter-terrorism action plan. From 2007 to 2008, Aly worked for the Equal Opportunity Commission WA.

Deputy PM Julie Bishop, Mathias Cormann, John Howard, and Luke Simpkins followed Keenan's lead. However, prior to Aly becoming a Labor candidate, Simpkins had written to Aly in 2015 to convey his admiration for her counter-terrorism work including \\"content of your media interviews and approach to the threat of radicalisation,\\" and Aly's work had been actively supported by the Coalition government. In 2016, Coalition MP George Christensen's Facebook page hosted \\"highly offensive\\" comments including death threats aimed at Aly. Aly was reelected in the 2019 federal election with a slightly increased margin of 1.6%.

R√∂sler was born in Braschen, a small village in Eastern Brandenburg (since 1945 part of Poland). His father was a teacher. He attended school in Crossen and then in Frankfurt (Oder), where in 1938 he passed his school final examinations (Abitur). During 1939 he undertook a mining internship in Silesia. However, in 1939 war had returned. He was conscripted and served as a soldier in France and the Soviet Union between 1940 and 1944. This was followed by a three-year period, between 1944 and 1947, as a prisoner of war, which in R√∂sler's case involved mining work in Morocco. Following that it was no longer possible to return home due to the border changes and the industrial-scale ethnic cleansing that had been a feature of the closing part of the war which had ended in defeat for Germany, victory for the Soviet Union, and a westward shift for Poland, formally in May 1945. Instead he moved to Freiberg, in the heart of the Saxony mining region, and here he embarked on a lengthy period of study at the local Mining Academy. His subject was Mineralogy. The doctorate which he received in 1954 was the result of a piece of work submitted on the geochemistry of Lignite (\\"brown coal\\"). In 1959 he became the head of the Institute for Chemistry and Mineralogy at what was then the Freiberg Mining Academy (today the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology).

The revival of the Confederate battle flag, together with other Confederate flags, began with Senator Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrats in reaction to growing public support for racial equality, alongside opposition to civil rights in 1948. Those seeking more depth are referred by the authors to their article \\"Racial Prejudice, Southern Heritage, and White Support for the Confederate Battle Flag\\", Du Bois Review, Vol. 14, No. 1, 2017. Although never an official national flag, the most popular and widely recognized symbol of the Confederacy is a rejected national design that was used as a battle flag. Displays of flags associated with the Confederacy have long been controversial. Some Southerners associate the Confederate battle flag with pride in Southern heritage, states' rights, historical commemoration of the American Civil War; others around the country associate it with historical revisionism and glorification of the Civil War (i.e. the Lost Cause myth), racism, slavery, segregation, white supremacy, intimidation of African-Americans, and treason.  Background   National flags  The Confederate States of America used three national flags during the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865, known as the \\"Stars and Bars\\" (1861‚Äì1863), the \\"Stainless Banner\\" (1863‚Äì65), and the \\"Blood-Stained Banner\\" (1865). The \\"Stars and Bars\\" was unpopular among Confederates for its resemblance to the United States flag, which caused confusion during battle. Criticism of the first national flag led to the rise of the battle flag design, which was incorporated by the \\"Stainless Banner\\" and the \\"Blood- Stained Banner\\". The \\"Stainless Banner\\" was criticized for its excessive white design, creating fears that it could be mistaken for a flag of truce and causing it to be easily soiled. The \\"Blood-Stained Banner\\", issued a little over a month before the Confederacy's surrender, was seldom used due to few flags being manufactured.  The vernacular \\"Confederate flag\\"  1896 lithograph of the three Confederate national flags and the battle flag Designed by William Porcher Miles, the chairman of the Flag and Seal Committee of the Confederate Provisional Congress, the flag now generally known as the \\"Confederate flag\\" was first proposed and rejected as the national flag in 1861. However, the design was adopted as a battle flag by the Army of Northern Virginia (ANV) under General Robert E. Lee and grew in popularity throughout the Confederacy. To conserve material, the ANV changed Miles' design from a rectangle to a square for the battle flag. The rectangular version, similar to the battle flag used by the Army of Tennessee under General Joseph E. Johnston, is the most popular today and common in modern reproductions. Despite never having historically represented the Confederacy as a country nor been officially recognized as one of its flags, it is commonly referred to as \\"the Confederate Flag\\" and has become a widely recognized symbol of the American South. It is also known as the \\"rebel flag,\\" \\"Dixie flag,\\" \\"the Confederate battle flag,\\" and \\"Southern cross.\\" Due to misconceptions of this design being the Confederacy's national flag, it is often incorrectly called the \\"Stars and Bars\\" after the original national design. The self-declared Confederate exclave of Town Line, New York, lacking a genuine Confederate flag, flew a version of this flag prior to its 1946 vote to ceremonially rejoin the Union.  Revival and controversy  Confederate soldiers were not familiar with the modern flag as such, but many were fond of the flags of their own units. These often included design elements found on the modern Confederate flag. They honored battlefield camaraderie rather than Southern nationalism. During the \\"memorial period\\" that ran from the late 19th century through the 1920s, use of Confederate flags broadened and they became the symbolic embodiment of the Lost Cause. The Confederate battle flag was added to the state flag of Mississippi in 1894 and appeared on two former state flags of Georgia from 1956 until 2003. The 50th anniversary reunion at Gettysburg in 1913 was a turning point in obtaining national acceptance of the flag and other Confederate symbols. The flag appears prominently in Birth of a Nation (1915), a highly successful and influential film. Margaret Mitchell's novel, Gone with the Wind, led to a brief but intense period of nostalgia for the Old South during which the Confederate flag appeared widely. In the film adaptation, the flag flutters over a scene of vast carnage.  Military use  Notification to remove all depictions of the Confederate Battle Flag from U.S. Marine Corps installations During World War II some U.S. military units with Southern nicknames, or composed largely of Southerners, made the flag their unofficial emblem. Some soldiers carried Confederate flags into battle. After the Battle of Okinawa a Confederate flag was raised over Shuri Castle by a Marine from the self-styled \\"Rebel Company\\" (Company A of the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines). It was visible for miles and was taken down after three days on the orders of General Simon B. Buckner, Jr. (son of Confederate general Simon Buckner, Sr.), who stated that it was inappropriate as \\"Americans from all over are involved in this battle\\". It was replaced with the regulation, 48-star flag of the United States. By the end of World War II, the use of the Confederate flag in the military was rare. In 1952, Destroyer Division 122 (known as the \\"Dixie Division\\" because its four commanders were from the South) was ordered to stop flying the Confederate flag. In 2020, Commandant of the Marine Corps David Berger directed Marine Corps leaders to remove all Confederate-related items from all the Corps‚Äô bases throughout the world. The U.S. Navy also banned the use of the Confederate battle flag in all public places on installations, ships, and aircraft in 2020.  Political groups  The 1948 Dixiecrat political party extensively used Confederate symbols, including the battle flag, and it contributed to the flag's post-World War II re-popularization. According to historian John Coski, segregationists utilized Confederate symbols since both they and the Confederates had similar goals, that is, opposition to efforts to \\"change the South's racial status quo.\\" As a result, Coski stated that \\"There could be no more fitting opposition\\" to desegregation \\"than the Confederate battle flag. Although segregationists lost their battle and their cause was discredited, attitudes of white supremacy live on.\\" In Georgia, the Confederate battle flag was reintroduced as an element of the state flag in 1956, just two years after the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education. It was considered by many to be a protest against school desegregation.\\"Confederate Flag Controversy\\", Education Helper, by Sharon Fabian It was also raised at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) during protests against integration of schools.\\"With All Deliberate Speed\\", Smithsonian National Socialist Movement marching at Market Square in Knoxville, Tennessee - August 14, 2010 Supporters of the flag's continued use claim it is a symbol of Southern ancestry and heritage as well as representing a distinct and independent cultural tradition of the Southern United States from the rest of the country. Some groups use the \\"southern cross\\" as one of the symbols associated with their organizations, including groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. However, the flag of the United States is commonly used instead. For other supporters, the Confederate flag represents only a past era of Southern sovereignty. As the public display of Nazi flags (or any other flags) is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech, both the Nazi- era Reichskriegsflagge, and the original style of Nazi Party flag used by the Third Reich, have also been seen on display at white supremacist events within United States borders, side by side with the Confederate flag, Historian John Coski noted that the Sons of Confederate Veterans, the \\"most visible, active, and effective defender of the flag\\", \\"carried forward into the twenty-first century, virtually unchanged, the Lost Cause historical interpretations and ideological vision formulated at the turn of the twentieth.\\"Coski pp. 192‚Äì93 Coski wrote concerning \\"the flag wars of the late twentieth century\\": The allied United Daughters of the Confederacy and other historical societies also used the flag as part of their symbols. In Petersburg, Virginia, the Ladies Memorial Association of Petersburg in 1909 had a Tiffany stained-glass Confederate flag included in a window over the door to the former Blandford Church. From a very different political perspective, both the Southern Student Organizing Committee and the Young Patriots Organization (the latter among Southern migrants in Chicago), were 1960/70s New Left anti-racist movements that attempted to reappropriate the Confederate flag in their symbolism.  Religious groups  At its annual meeting In 2016, the Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution calling for Southern Baptist churches to stop displaying the Confederate flag, as a \\"sign of solidarity of the whole Body of Christ.\\"  Public opinion (2011-2017)  The Confederate flag is a controversial symbol for many Americans today. A 2011 Pew Research Center poll revealed that 30% of Americans had a \\"negative reaction\\" when \\"they saw the Confederate flag displayed.\\" According to the same poll, 9% of Americans had a positive reaction. A majority (58%) had no reaction. Among black Americans, 41% had a negative reaction, 10% had a positive reaction and 45% had no reaction. A similar poll taken in 2015 revealed little change from 2011. In an October 2013 YouGov poll, a plurality (38%) of those polled disapproved of displaying the flag in public places. In the same poll, a plurality (44%) of those asked viewed the flag as a symbol of racism, with 24% viewing it as exclusively racist and 20% viewing it as both racist and symbolic of pride in the region. In a national survey in 2015 across all races, 57% of Americans had the opinion that the Confederate flag represented Southern pride rather than racism. A similar poll in 2000 had a nearly identical result of 59%. However, poll results from only the South yielded a completely different result: 75% of Southern whites described the flag as a symbol of pride. Conversely, 75% of Southern blacks said the flag symbolized racism. Another poll, administered by Economist / YouGov after racially motivated violence in Charleston in August 2017, showed that by a 5% margin ‚Äì 43% to 38% ‚Äì the Confederate Flag was viewed as a symbol of southern pride rather than racism. However, participants of color were 32% more likely than their white neighbors to see it as a sign of racism.  Historical and modern meaning  Confederate flag made out of flowers at the Confederate Statue in Jasper, Alabama. 2010 As a result of these varying perceptions, there have been a number of political controversies surrounding the use of the Confederate battle flag in Southern state flags, at sporting events, at Southern universities, and on public buildings. In their study of Confederate symbols in the contemporary Southern United States, the Southern political scientists James Michael Martinez, William Donald Richardson, and Ron McNinch-Su wrote: Southern historian Gordon Rhea further wrote in 2011: Symbols of the Confederacy remain a contentious issue across the United States and their civic placement has been debated vigorously in many southern U.S. state legislatures since the early 1990s, such as the effort that led to the replacement of Georgia's flag in 2001. Supporters have labeled attempts to display the flag as an exercise of free speech in response to bans in some schools and universities, but have not always been successful in court when attempting to use this justification. In a 2001 essay, \\"Old Times There Are Best Forgotten\\", Emory University professor Lucas Carpenter observed that \\"Contemporary Confederate sympathizers want free use of Confederate symbolism because they say it represents their 'heritage.' It does, of course, but it is heritage chiefly characterized by its brutal oppression of slaves and their 'free' descendants. The most important thing to know about the South is that until recently it was a region ruled by slavery and apartheid.\\" Popularity outside the southern U.S. The flag has found some popularity in places far outside of the former Confederacy, especially in rural areas in the United States. =Pacific Northwest= When researching his ethnography of whites, Searching for Whitopia, scholar Rich Benjamin kept a notepad while traveling the Pacific Northwest. \\"I remember driving through swaths of Washington and Oregon and seeing a lot of Confederate flags\\", Benjamin explained to journalist Matthew Novak. \\"There are a lot of refugees from the South who seem attracted to Oregon not because they're racists, but because Oregon has a racial homogeneity and a conservatism and a gun culture that they really appreciate.\\" The Pacific Northwest offers a cultural collision between the Confederate flag, other emblems of racism, and its new technological profit hubs. 3rd Flag of the Confederacy and the Bonnie Blue Flag at Jefferson Davis Park, Washington, 2018 Calls for the removal of Confederate flags from Jefferson Davis Park in southwestern Washington state began in 2015, after the Charleston church shooting, by Rev. Marva Edwards, the president of Vancouver's NAACP chapter. Even though the markers and flags are located on private property, they are and were intended to be highly visible (to all cars traveling Interstate 5). Their visibility, and events in other parts of the nation regarding Confederate memorials, still make these symbols a local focus of strong emotions, especially in the aftermath of the white nationalist Unite the Right rally August 11‚Äì12, 2017. =San Francisco City Hall= Eighteen flags fly at Civic Center Plaza in front of the San Francisco City Hall, each representing important events in United States history. These include several related to the American Revolution, along with the original flags of the Republic of California and the Republic of Texas. It also briefly included the Confederate flag, but it was removed in 1964 in response to protests by civil rights activists. Anti-LGBT protesters in Rzesz√≥w, Poland, in 2019. =At European far-right events= In a \\"limited\\" degree of reciprocity with its use beside the First Amendment-protected display of Nazi flags at far-right events within the United States, there has increasingly been seen at far-right group gatherings within some European nations' borders, the use of the rectangular \\"rebel flag\\" form of the Confederate naval jack, in place of often-banned Third Reich flags. In Ukraine, a Confederate flag was prominently displayed in the hall of Kiev's city council following the Maidan revolution. =\\"Southern pride\\" in Italy's football stadiums= Washington Post reporter Adam Taylor, in an article of June 22, 2015 about use of Confederate flag in Italy, reports that first time S.S.C. Napoli supporters were noticed flying the flag abroad was in Chelsea, during quarterfinals of football Champions League in 2012. He quotes explanation, given several years before to historian Don Harrison Doyle and reported in \\"Divided Nations\\" (2002) by a professor of American Literature in Naples: \\"We too are a defeated people. Once we were a rich and independent country, and then they came from the North and conquered us and took our wealth and power away to Rome.\\" Writer Vladimiro Bottone, in an article of July 15, 2004 on Naples newspaper Corriere del Mezzogiorno, adds that stadium is the \\"place [where] the first virulent and explicit opposition between North and South of the post-war period was made visible in a mass dimension‚Äù [...]. For Napoli FC supporters, [...] ‚ÄúNapoli is what it could have been if the robbery of Savoy sneaky team (aiming to Juventus FC, main team of Turin, town of the Savoy, the Italian Royal family, ndr) was not able to perpetrate its damage, to the point of colonizing the Belpaese football with the violence of fraud, thus distorting the development of what should be a fair competition between territories.\\" In film and television The 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit, set in the Southern United States, featured a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am displaying the flag mounted on the front license plate of the vehicle. The 1979‚Äì1985 American television series The Dukes of Hazzard, set in a fictional Georgia county, featured the General Lee stock car with the flag prominently painted over its roof throughout the series' run. Thelma in the 1991 film Thelma & Louise wears a shirt with this flag as part of a larger motif. Use by musicians The Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd has made heavy use of the flag. They tried distancing themselves from it because of its divisive history as a symbol of racism in 2012. In an interview with CNN, Gary Rossington stated, \\"We just had it in the beginning because we're Southern and that was our image back in the '70s and late '60s. But I think people through the years, people like the KKK and the skinheads‚Ä¶kidnapped the Dixie rebel flag, the Southern tradition and the heritage of the soldiers, you know, that's what it was about. We didn't want that to go to our fans or show the image like we agreed with any of the race stuff or any of the bad things.\\" Two weeks later, after backlash from fans, they resumed using it, with Rossington stating on the band's website, \\"We know what the Dixie flag represents and its heritage; the Civil War was fought over States rights.\\" Metal band Pantera sold numerous items in their official online store that featured the flag until July 2015. Founding member Dimebag Darrell, who was shot and killed in 2004, used a Dean ML guitar customized with the flag covering the guitar's body. As of July 2015, singer Phil Anselmo distanced himself from usage of the flag. Hip-hop group Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz used the flag (burning) on the cover of their 2001 album Put Yo Hood Up, as well as in the music video for their single \\"Bia' Bia'\\". Rockabilly musician Ray Campi played an upright bass with a customized image of the flag on the back of the instrument. At some point prior to 2009, he changed the image to the Texan flag. Southern rocker Tom Petty used the Confederate flag in his 1985 Southern Accents tour, tying its imagery to the lead character in his song \\"Rebels\\". In 2015, he declaimed his use of the flag as \\"downright stupid,\\" saying \\"It‚Äôs like how a swastika looks to a Jewish person.\\" Despite hailing from Michigan, singer Kid Rock prominently displayed the Confederate flag on his tours starting with his 2001 album Cocky, but by 2011 had quietly abandoned the flag. University of Mississippi statue On February 16, 2014, University of Mississippi campus police discovered the James Meredith memorial statue, erected in October 2006, surrounded with pre-2003 Georgia State Flags (containing the Confederate Flag) and a rope tied into a noose around the neck of the statue. Meredith, an alumnus of the University of Mississippi, was, in October 1962, the first African American to attend the school. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oxford, Mississippi Police Department conducted an investigation shortly after the event which led to the arrest of Graeme Phillip Harris, a former freshman at the university. Harris pleaded guilty in June 2015 to a misdemeanor for using threat of force to intimidate African-American students and employees. U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills sentenced Harris to six months in prison, followed by twelve months of supervision after release. A second student, Austin Reed Edenfield, 21, was sentenced to a year of probation in addition to 50 hours of community service. A third student has yet to be charged. House bill banning the flag at Veterans Administration cemeteries On May 19, 2016, the United States House of Representatives voted to ban the display of Confederate flags on flagpoles at Veterans Administration cemeteries, by a 265‚Äì159 vote. The ban was contained in an amendment (House Amendment 592, 114th Congress) to House bill 2822, an appropriations bill.https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/house- amendment/592/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22huffman%22%5D%7D, retrieved May 20, 2016. The author of the amendment was California congressman Jared Huffman, who stated that the flag represented \\"racism, slavery and division.\\"Display of the Confederate Flag at Federal Cemeteries in the United States. CRS Insight, Congressional Research Service, August 31, 2016. In June 2016, Republicans in Congress attempted to attach an amendment to a bill funding the fight against the Zika virus epidemic that would have reversed the flag ban. It was just one provision of several that Republicans had attached, including an amendment cutting Planned Parenthood funding. Senate Democrats blocked the bill through filibuster. Six Flags Over Texas In August 2017, in response to the controversial Unite the Right rally that was held in Charlottesville, the park Six Flags Over Texas replaced its six flags (which had included the first Confederate flag) with six American flags. A representative of the park told KXAS-TV, \\"We always choose to focus on celebrating the things that unite us versus those that divide us. As such, we have changed the flag displays in our park to feature American flags.\\" Display at American University On September 27, 2017, ten Confederate flag posters bearing chunks of cotton were found on the campus of American University. The date coincided with the presentation by historian Ibram Kendi to introduce the Anti-racist Research and Policy Center.  Official usage in Southern U.S. states  In the years after the end of the American Civil War, many former slave states that were members of the Confederacy during the war adopted new state flags. Incorporating in their new flags' designs were motifs that were used in the Confederacy's flags, such as the St. Andrew's cross. In the case of Mississippi, Florida, and Alabama these new state flags were adopted around the same time that new Jim Crow segregation laws were being enacted. These laws, combined with poll taxes, literacy tests, and extrajudicial violence such as lynchings, disenfranchised African American voters for the next ninety years. According to historian John M. Coski:  State flags  = Alabama = Though state legislation described the flag of Alabama as being based on the design of St. Andrew's Cross, it has been hypothesized that the crimson saltire of the flag was designed to resemble the blue saltire of the Confederate Battle Flag. The legislation that created the state flag did not specify if the flag was going to be square or rectangular. The authors of a 1917 article in National Geographic expressed their opinion that because the Alabama flag was based on the Battle Flag, it should be square. In 1987, the office of Alabama Attorney General Don Siegelman issued an opinion in which the Battle Flag derivation is repeated, but concluded that the proper shape is rectangular, as it had been depicted numerous times in official publications and reproductions. Another slim possibility is in the flag of Co. F 7th Regiment Alabama Cavalry. The regiment was the only Alabama regiment in Rucker's Brigade commanded by Col. Edmund Rucker of Tennessee, later Alabama, who became a prominent Montgomery businessman after the war. The flag of the brigade used a white background with a red saltire which did not always extend to the corners and charged with dark colored stars upon the saltire. The flag of Co. F, 7th Alabama Cavalry is currently held by the Alabama Department of Archives and History as part of its Alabama Civil War Period Flag Collection. But, the flag carried by Co. F 7th Alabama was not an Alabama Flag, it was the flag made for Rucker's Brigade a month before the 7th joined his brigade; the 7th was color party only after September 24, 1864. A bunting flag that exists, in the white and red configuration with 13 blue stars, is not believed to be Alabama associated, but tied to Rucker's Brigade. The city of Montgomery, Alabama uses a flag similar to the Confederate battle flag, but with one half resembling the battle flag while the other half is gray, representing the Confederate army's uniforms' colors. = Arkansas = The flag of Arkansas contains four blue stars within a diamond representing the four countries that historically controlled the territory; one of these stars represents the Confederate States of America. The design of the border around the white diamond evokes the saltire found on the Confederate battle flag.Ark. Code Ann. (1987), Section 1‚Äì4‚Äì101; cited in B.F. Shearer and B.S. Shearer (2002), State Names, Seals, Flags, and Symbols, Greenwood Press, p. 54 In 2019, the Arkansas legislature did not approve a bill that would have redefined the star as referring to Native Americans. = Florida = The current flag of Florida, adopted by popular referendum in 1900, with minor changes in 1985, contains the Cross of Burgundy. It is believed that the Cross was added in memory of, and showing support for, the Confederacy. The addition of the Cross was proposed by Governor Francis P. Fleming, a former Confederate soldier, who was strongly committed to racial segregation. However, some historians believe the flag dates back to the original flag the Spanish flew over Florida in the 16th century. = Georgia = In 1956 the Georgian state flag was redesigned to incorporate the Confederate battle flag. Following protests over this aspect of the design in the 1990s by the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and other groups, efforts began in the Georgia General Assembly to remove the battle flag from the state flag's design. These efforts succeeded in January 2001 when Georgia Governor Roy Barnes introduced a design that, though continuing to depict the Battle Flag, greatly reduced its prominence. The following year, amidst dwindling demands for the return of the 1956 design (\\"Battle Flag\\" version) and lesser opposing demands for the continued use of the new \\"Barnes'\\" design, the Georgia General Assembly redesigned the flag yet again; it adopted a \\"compromise\\" design using the 13-star First National Flag of the Confederacy (the \\"Stars and Bars\\"), combined with a simplified version of Georgia's state seal placed within the circle of 13 stars on the flag's canton. The city flag of Trenton, Georgia, United States, was adopted in 2001 as a protest following the change of the state flag of Georgia. The flag has been controversial because it incorporates the Confederate Battle Flag. Recent flags of Georgia = Mississippi = City Hall in Laurel, Mississippi in 2012 The Confederate battle flag became a part of the flag of Mississippi in 1894. In 1906, the flag statutes were omitted by error from the new legal code of the state, leaving Mississippi without an official flag. The omission was not discovered until 1993, when a lawsuit filed by the NAACP regarding the flag was being reviewed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi. In 2000, Governor Ronnie Musgrove issued an executive order making the flag official, which it did in February 2001. After continued controversy, the decision was turned over to citizens of the state, who, on April 17, 2001, voted 2:1 to keep the Confederate Battle Flag a part of the current state flag. Following the Charleston church shooting in June 2015 and subsequent discussion of the flying of the Confederate Battle Flag at the South Carolina State House, Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives Philip Gunn publicly called for the removal of the Confederate Battle Flag from the flag of Mississippi. During the George Floyd protests, more discussion about changing the flag was held, with legislation being introduced into the state legislature. On June 27, 2020, the Mississippi Legislature voted to suspend rules in order to debate over and vote on a bill to address the flag issue. On June 28, both houses passed a bill to abolish the state flag, remove the flag from public institutions within 15 days of its enactment, and create a nine- member commission to design a replacement that would exclude the Confederate battle flag and include the motto \\"In God We Trust\\".http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2020/pdf/history/HB/HB1796.xml Governor Tate Reeves signed the bill into law on . = North Carolina = The first flag of North Carolina which was adopted in 1861 had two ribbons. On one of the ribbons is emblazoned \\"May 20th, 1775\\". The other one had the inscription \\"May 20, 1861\\".Flag of North Carolina, Britannica The new flag which was adopted in 1885 has a modified design with other colors and the date of the North Carolina's secession was replaced by \\"April 12, 1776\\".North Carolina Flag, World Population ReviewFlag of North Carolina, state symbols USA = Tennessee = The current Flag of Tennessee was designed by Colonel Lee Roy Reeves, an attorney and officer of the Tennessee National Guard. The flag was officially adopted in 1905, replacing the original post-Civil War state flag. Although the symbolism is reported as referencing only the State of Tennessee, its color scheme, symbolism, and design evoke the flags of the Confederacy. The red field and blue charge with white fimbriation evoke the Confederate Battle Flag, and the placement of the vertical bar at the fly of the field evokes the Third National Flag of the Confederacy. The language the designer used to describe the three central stars ('the indissoluble trinity', albeit regarding the three 'grand regions' of Tennessee) and their central placement evokes the cross of St. Andrew of the Confederate Battle Flag. Vexillologist Steven A. Knowlton, an Assistant Professor and Collection Development Librarian of the University Libraries of the University of Memphis, believes the relationship of the current Tennessee State Flag and the flags of the Confederacy is one of \\"pragmatic unity\\" with a \\"deeper symbolic recognition\\" linking it to the Confederacy. While there is no explicit evidence of any intention on the part of the designer to create a link, Knowlton believes many Tennesseans have perceived and continue to perceive a link, given the cultural and historical context. Christopher Ingraham of the Brookings Institution, citing Professor Knowlton, considers this a case of \\"plausible deniability\\" and that the flag is one of seven state flags visually continuing the legacy of the Confederacy.  State symbol  Stone Mountain, Georgia, is a \\"monument to the Confederacy\\" that was paid for and is owned by the state of Georgia. Stone Mountain Park opened 100 years to the day after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. It is the most visited destination in the state of Georgia. Four flags of the Confederacy are flown at Stone Mountain. In addition, the Stone Mountain Memorial Lawn \\"contains...thirteen terraces ‚Äî one for each Confederate state.... Each terrace flies the flag that the state flew as member of the Confederacy.\\"  State seals  The first Confederate flag, together with five other nations that have had sovereignty over Texas (Spain, France, Mexico, Republic of Texas, United States) appear above one of the side entrances to the Capitol. They also appear on the reverse of the Seal of Texas, which is the subject of a floor mosaic in the Capitol Extension. The reverse of the seal was proposed by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas and approved by the Texas Legislature and Governor in 1961, modified in 1991. The Alabamian coat of arms features the Confederate battle flag's saltire in its design. Similar to Texas, the saltire on the coat of arms represents one of the five countries which have held sovereignty over part or all of Alabama. The shield of the Confederacy was found in the Rotunda of the Florida Capitol, together with those of France, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States ‚Äì all of them treated equally as \\"nations\\" that Florida was part of or governed by. The five flags \\"that have flown in Florida\\" were included on the official Senate seal, displayed prominently in the Senate chambers, on its stationery, and throughout the Capitol. On October 19, 2015, the Senate agreed to change the seal so as to remove the Confederate battle flag from it.Associated Press, \\"Florida Senate plans to remove Confederate flag from seal\\", Sun-Sentinel, October 19, 2015. The new (2016) Senate seal has only the flags of the United States and Florida.  Vehicle license plates  In Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, vehicle owners can request a state-issued license plate featuring the Sons of Confederate Veterans logo, which incorporates the square Confederate battle flag.Plate images for Georgia , North Carolina , Alabama, Maryland , Mississippi , South Carolina , Tennessee, and Virginia In 1998, a North Carolina appellate court upheld the issuance of such license plates in the case Sons of Confederate v. DMV, noting: \\"We are aware of the sensitivity of many of our citizens to the display of the Confederate flag. Whether the display of the Confederate flag on state-issued license plates represents sound public policy is not an issue presented to this Court in this case. That is an issue for our General Assembly.\\" In 2015, the dispute over Texas vanity plates that would have displayed the logo ended up before the United States Supreme Court. In its decision in Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, the court ruled that license plates are governmental speech, so the government may decide what to have printed on them. Texas's refusal to issue flag-emblazoned license plates therefore didn't violate petitioners' right to free speech. In 2015, Virginia recalled its vanity plates with the Confederate flag emblem pictured within the logo of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. To holders of SCV plates, the state mailed replacements without the emblem. The old design with the emblem was invalidated and driving with such Virginia tags was made a misdemeanor similar to driving an unlicensed vehicle, though in October 2015 a SCV legal team tried fighting the ban in court.  Display at the South Carolina State Capitol  The flag flying at the South Carolina Confederate Monument in Columbia, South Carolina.The Confederate battle flag was raised over the State House on April 11, 1961 at the request of Representative John May, ostensibly as a part of opening celebrations of the Confederate War Centennial, according to Dr. Daniel Hollis, an appointed member of the centennial commission. Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House. As Time magazine later noted, the move was \\"a states‚Äô-rights rebuff to desegregation.\\" In 1996, then-governor David Beasley advocated for the removal of the flag from the Capitol dome, but later backtracked and was voted out of office. On April 12, 2000, the South Carolina State Senate passed a bill to remove the Confederate flag from the top of the State House dome by a majority vote of 36 to 7. \\"...[T]he new bill specified that a more traditional version of the battle flag would be flown in front of the Capitol next to a monument honoring fallen Confederate soldiers.\\" The bill also passed the state's House of Representatives, but not without some difficulty. On May 18, 2000, after the bill was modified to ensure that the height of the flag's new pole would be , it was passed by a majority of 66 to 43. Governor Jim Hodges signed the bill into law five days later after it passed the state Senate. On July 1, 2000 the flag was removed from atop the State House by two students (one white and one black) from The Citadel; Civil War re-enactors then raised a Confederate battle flag on a 30-foot pole on the front lawn of the Capitol next to a slightly taller monument honoring Confederate soldiers who died during the Civil War. State law prohibited the flag's removal from the State House grounds without additional legislation. In 2005, two Western Carolina University researchers found that 74% of African- Americans polled favored removing the flag from the State House altogether. The NAACP and other civil rights groups attacked the flag's continued presence at the state capitol. The NAACP maintained an official economic boycott of South Carolina for 15 years, citing the state's continued display of the battle flag, until the flag was eventually removed completely from the State House grounds. In 2000, the National Collegiate Athletic Association \\"announced that it will cancel future Association-sponsored events in South Carolina if that state doesn't take action to remove the Confederate battle flag from atop its state capitol.\\" The association said that \\"many coaches and student-athletes feel that an inhospitable environment is created by the display of the Confederate flag over the South Carolina state house\\", and its chair said \\"there is no question that to a significant number of our constituents, the flag is a symbol of oppression.\\" This has prevented South Carolina from hosting any championship sporting events in which the sites are determined in advance. This NCAA ban on postseason championships in South Carolina was strictly enforced, with the exception of HBCU Benedict College. In both 2007 and 2009, the school hosted the postseason Pioneer Bowl game, in violation of the NCAA ban, though no action was taken. On April 14, 2007, Steve Spurrier, coach of the University of South Carolina football team, made an acceptance speech for a community service award in which he referred to the flag on the State House grounds as \\"that damn flag.\\" This statement was also inspired by the actions of, as Spurrier said, \\"some clown\\" who waved the battle flag while being videotaped for SportsCenter. On July 6, 2009, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced a decision to move three future baseball tournaments out of South Carolina citing miscommunications with the NAACP concerning the display of the Confederate flag in the state. In June 2015, Bree Newsome, filmmaker and activist, climbed the flagpole and removed the flag in the wake of the Charleston church shooting. On July 10, 2015, Republican governor Nikki Haley ordered the flag removed, and it was given to the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room & Military Museum.Bill 4895, South Carolina General Assembly, 113th Session, 1999-2000 After 2015, the South Carolina Secessionist Party has sometimes raised the flag on a temporary flagpole at the capitol on July 10, to mark the anniversary of the flag's removal. Marion County, Florida A Confederate flag flies on the grounds of the Marion County Courthouse. Remington, Virginia The town of Remington, Virginia, has a Confederate flag in its municipal seal. A variation of the seal, Confederate flag included, appears on their police uniform shoulder patches.  Official use in Americana, S√£o Paulo  From 1975 to 1998, a version of the Confederate battle flag appeared in the coat of arms and flag of Americana, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, a city settled by Confederate expatriates.  Presence in other parts of the world  Two Swedish raggare sporting the Confererate battle flag. The flag is used significantly in foreign countries, especially Europe. The flag's link to slavery and racism is clearly a factor in many cases; in Germany, it is used instead of prohibited Nazi symbols. In Southern Italy it symbolizes the South's dissatisfaction with the North. Fans of Cork GAA have waved the flag at intercounty matches, reflecting the nickname of County Cork as \\"the Rebel County\\" for its prominence in historical Irish rebellions, and red as the county color. The Cork GAA president in 2017 appealed to fans not to use such flags, and his successor in 2020 said they would in future be confiscated at Cork stadiums. Some use of the flag is however not political. The car-centered subculture raggare of Sweden sometimes use the flags on their vehicles and clothing as a kitsch symbol to represent America, without political meanings, along with other American symbols such as cowboy hats, old American muscle cars and other Americana.  Reactions to the Charleston church shooting  On June 18, 2015, the day after a deadly church shooting was perpetrated in Charleston, South Carolina, by white supremacist Dylann Roof, whose website contained pictures of him holding the Confederate Battle Flag, many flags were flown at half- staff, including those at the South Carolina State House. The Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina Confederate Monument near the state house was not at half-staff, as South Carolina law prohibits alteration of the flag without the consent of two-thirds of the state legislature. The flagpole lacked a pulley system, and thus the flag could not be flown at half-staff, only removed or left in place, as it was. Flags flying over Fort Sumter in 2009, including Confederate national flags In June 2015, the National Park Service ceased flying Confederate flags over Fort Sumter. On June 23, 2015, three state governors‚ÄîTerry McAuliffe of Virginia (a Democrat), Pat McCrory of North Carolina (a Republican), and Larry Hogan of Maryland (a Republican)‚Äîannounced plans to seek discontinuation of their states' Confederate-flag specialty license plates. In addition to the Charleston killings, the governors cited the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, issued days earlier, in which the Court affirmed that states are not constitutionally obligated to issue Confederate specialty plates. On June 24, 2015, Robert Bentley, governor of Alabama, ordered the removal of the Confederate flag from a memorial on the state capitol grounds. A spokeswoman for Governor Robert Bentley told the Montgomery Advertiser on Wednesday that he did not want the flag to be a \\"distraction\\". Speaking with AL.com, Bentley said he made the decision himself to take the flag down. There were renewed calls for the flag of Mississippi, the only state flag that still includes a Confederate battle emblem, to be changed, but several bills introduced in the Mississippi Legislature were not successful. A number of municipalities and schools in Mississippi, including the University of Mississippi and the city of Biloxi, announced they would no longer display the current flag.\\"Battle over Confederate symbols continues with Mississippi state flag.\\" CNN. June 19, 2016. Retrieved 2017-05-06.\\"Biloxi won't fly state flag.\\" Associated Press (via Clarion-Ledger). April 27, 2017. Retrieved 2017-05-06.  Removal from the South Carolina State Capitol  Following the Charleston shooting, many commentators questioned the continued display of the Confederate flag on the South Carolina State House grounds. Calls to remove the Confederate flag from the State House grounds, as well as debates over the context of its symbolic nature, were renewed after the attack by several prominent figures, including President Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, and Jeb Bush. On June 20, several thousand people gathered in front of the South Carolina State House in protest. An online petition at MoveOn.org encouraging the removal of the flag had received over 370,000 signatures by that time. At a statehouse press conference on June 22, 2015, Governor Nikki Haley, flanked by elected officials of both parties, including U.S. Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, and former Republican Governor Mark Sanford, called for the flag to be removed by the state legislature, saying that while the flag was \\"an integral part of our past, it does not represent the future\\" of South Carolina. \\"We are not going to allow this symbol to divide us any longer,\\" she said. The legislature, scheduled to meet the following day for a budget session, must vote by a two-thirds majority to extend debate to the flag issue, and by two-thirds to remove the flag from statehouse grounds, although the legality of that provision has been questioned by some lawmakers. Haley said she would call for a special session if the legislature did not act. \\"With the winds that started blowing last week, I figured it would just be a matter of time,\\" said Ken Thrasher, speaking for the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which opposed the flag's removal. \\"Whatever the Legislature decides to do, we will accept it graciously.\\" A number of prominent Republicans who had previously appeared to struggle with the issue immediately endorsed Haley's call to remove the flag, including Kentucky Senator and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, and governors and presidential hopefuls Scott Walker and Rick Perry. On June 23, 2015, the South Carolina General Assembly added discussion of the flag to its special-session agenda in a procedural vote that indicated broad bipartisan support to remove the flag from the Statehouse grounds. The motion carried by a unanimous voice vote in the state senate and by a 103‚Äì10 vote in the state house. In the senate chamber, the desk of Clementa Pinckney, the pastor and state senator who died in the attack, was draped in black cloth with a white rose atop it. Among the legislators speaking in favor of removing the flag was Republican State Senator Paul Thurmond, son of Senator Strom Thurmond, whose 1948 \\"Dixiecrat\\" segregationist presidential campaign helped politically re- popularize the flag. Eulogizing the Rev. Clementa Pinckney on June 26, 2015, before 5,000 congregants at the College of Charleston, President Barack Obama acknowledged that the shooting had catalyzed a broad movement, backed by both Republicans and Democrats, to remove the flag from official public display. \\"Blinded by hatred, [the gunman] failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood: the power of God's grace,\\" Obama said. \\"By taking down that flag we express God's grace. But I don't think God wants us to stop there.\\" In the weeks before the flag was officially removed, several men and women, including activist Bree Newsome, were arrested for removing or attempting to remove the flag as well as various other offenses stemming from the protests around the flagpole. The attempts to remove the flag were criticized by several South Carolina state legislators who supported the flag's removal because they said such actions could hurt their goal to have the flag permanently removed. On July 6, 2015, the South Carolina Senate voted, by the required two-thirds majority, to remove the Confederate flag from display on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. Following 13 hours of debate and over 60 attempts to amend the bill, the vote in the South Carolina House of Representatives to remove the flag was passed by a two- thirds majority (94‚Äì20) on July 9. Governor Nikki Haley signed the bill the same day. On July 10, the Confederate flag was removed from the State House grounds and placed in storage for later display at the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room & Military Museum. Following the removal of the flag, the NAACP announced the end of its 15-year boycott of South Carolina.  The Citadel's Summerall Chapel  The Confederate naval jack, installed in The Citadel's chapel in 1939, on display in September 2019 In June 2015 a controversy at The Citadel over a Confederate naval jack, model 1863‚Äì1865, ended when the school's Board of Visitors voted in favor of moving the flag from the Summerall Chapel to what was called \\"an appropriate location on campus.\\" As of September 2017, the flag had not yet been removed, nor had an \\"appropriate location\\" been selected.  Retailer bans  Following the Charleston shooting, the retailer Walmart announced that it would no longer sell items with the Confederate flag on them. In a statement to the press, Walmart stated that \\"We never want to offend anyone with the products that we offer. We have taken steps to remove all items promoting the Confederate flag from our assortment ‚Äì whether in our stores or on our web site.\\" Shortly afterward, a number of other retailers, including Amazon.com, eBay, Etsy, Sears (which also operates Kmart) and Target announced that they would also be removing Confederate flag items from sale. Google also pulled Confederate flag merchandise from their shopping site. Smaller flag retailers are also ceasing to sell it. Valley Forge Flag, Annin Flagmakers, Eder Flag and the Dixie Flag Manufacturing Company, four of the largest U.S. flag manufacturers, also announced that they would cease selling Confederate flags. General Lee\\", 1969 Dodge Charger, featured in The Dukes of Hazzard After the Charleston shooting, Warner Bros. announced that they were halting production of The Dukes of Hazzard \\"General Lee\\" toy cars, which prominently featured a Confederate flag on the roof of the car. Reruns of The Dukes of Hazzard television show were also pulled from TV Land's schedule due to the controversy. On July 2, 2015, professional golfer Bubba Watson announced that he would modify the General Lee car that he purchased at auction by painting an American flag over the Confederate flag that had appeared on the car's roof since it was customized for the TV series in 1978. Actor Ben Jones, who portrayed Cooter in the original series, announced that his chain of Cooter's Place novelty stores would still sell merchandise featuring the flag.\\"Cooter's Place will not remove Confederate flag merchandise. The Tennessean. June 24, 2015. Retrieved 2017-05-19. Actor John Schneider, who portrayed Bo Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard television series, said he was \\"saddened\\" that Roof's murders could \\"cause one of the most beloved television shows in the history of the medium to suddenly be seen in this light.\\" Also in June 2015, Apple's App Store began removing mobile apps featuring the flag. Several U.S Civil War- based wargames were initially removed, but Apple later announced that they were only targeting apps \\"that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean- spirited ways\\" and was working with developers who felt that their apps were wrongly removed. The U.S. National Park Service announced that it is requesting that its retail partners stop selling the Confederate flag, as well as other items that depict the flag as a stand-alone feature. NASCAR Following the Charleston shooting, the American auto racing sanctioning body NASCAR, which has roots in the Southern United States and has many fans who fly the Confederate flag at campsites, supported Governor Haley's decision to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House. In addition, NASCAR chairman Brian France vowed that the members of NASCAR's sanctioning body would not associate themselves with the flag and they also wanted to eliminate the flag from races. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series drivers and teammates Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Jeff Gordon, along with team owner and former NBA player Brad Daugherty (the only African-American team owner in NASCAR), also supported eliminating the Confederate flag from racing events. Prior to the Coke Zero 400 race at Daytona International Speedway on July 5, 2015, the track announced fans can voluntarily exchange Confederate flags for American flags. On July 2, 2015, the NASCAR tracks issued a joint statement calling for fans to refrain from flying the Confederate flag at races, but many fans still continued the practice. In June 2020 NASCAR announced that it would not allow the flag to be displayed by fans at events. Washington National Cathedral At the Washington National Cathedral, the Confederate battle flag appeared in two stained glass windows, which memorialize the Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. On June 8, 2016, Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and the interim dean of the cathedral, said they would be removed \\"as soon as we can do it\\" and replaced, at least temporarily, with plain glass. The windows were installed in 1953 after lobbying from the Daughters of the Confederacy. The dean of the cathedral, the Very Rev. Gary Hall, said the Charleston shooting was the catalyst for the planned removal, saying \\"It seemed to me that we couldn't, with credibility, address the race agenda if we were going to keep the windows in there.\\"John Reeves, \\"¬∞Should the National Cathedral remove its Robert E.

Backlash against removal Within a year of the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, a backlash against the removal of Confederate flags that the shooting inspired was playing out across the country, according to Politico. The backlash also extended to the national political scene. * In the first two months after the Charleston shooting, 173 Confederate flag rallies were held. * Confederate flags were displayed at rallies supporting Donald Trump. A police officer, Michael Peters, resigned after being suspended for flying a Confederate flag from his pickup truck at a \\"Love Trumps Hate\\" rally, three days after Trump's presidential win. Even though event organizers of rallies \\"...ask participants only to bring American flags to the rally, with no Confederate flags allowed\\", they continued to be seen at rallies. On July 6, 2017, a Confederate battle flag was waved to greet President Trump upon his arrival in Poland for a brief visit before the G20 summit in Hamburg.Charles P. Pierce, \\"An American President Was Greeted in Poland by the Confederate Flag\\", Esquire, July 6, 2017, http://www.esquire.com/news- politics/politics/news/a56168/poland-confederate-flag-trump/.

St. Mary's School opened in 1963, initially serving students from grades 9 through 12. With the opening of the public Lloydminster Comprehensive High School in 1968, the Catholic school division relinquished responsibilities of grades 10 through 12 to the public school division and re-purposed St. Mary's School as a junior high school in 1969. Due to growing enrollment across the division, Father Gorman Elementary School was built in 1977 followed by St. Joseph Elementary School in 1982. By 1985, the division had sufficient facility space and demand to offer Catholic education for grades 10 through 12. St. Mary's School became a high school and was renamed Holy Rosary High School. √âcole St. Thomas also began to offer Lloydminster's first French Immersion program in 1985. Holy Rosary High School moved to a new facility in the fall of 2001, serving students Grades 8 through 12 with both English and French Immersion learning opportunities. The former facility was once again renamed St. Mary's School. The construction of the new Holy Rosary High School included adjacent office space for the division office. √âcole St. Thomas School moved to a newly built facility in the fall of 2013, with the former building being re-purposed as Mother Teresa Early Childhood Education Center.

History  Affirmations was founded in 1989 as Affirmations Lesbian and Gay Community Center to serve LGBT people in Southeast Michigan. Affirmations was incorporated by Jeff Vitale and Laura Horowitz. The original by-laws were written by Jeff Vitale and Gary Roberts. Vitale and Roberts met when Roberts answered an ad Vitale placed in Metro Times for GLMPSE (Gays and Lesbians Mobilizing Politically, Socially and Economically) a short-lived organization also founded by Vitale. Vitale served as the founding president of Affirmations. He and Roberts assembled the first board of directors. Roberts served on the first board as vice president not president as reported by Between the Lines. Jan Stevenson became the second president when Vitale took a Market Research position in Chicago where he shortly thereafter founded Overlooked Opinions, the first market research and polling firm specializing in the lesbian and gay community in the United States. Jan Stevenson coined Affirmation's first motto \\"Gay is Good.\\" Originally, Affirmations was housed in a building owned by the Michigan Organization for Human Rights (MOHR), and was funded through community donations as well as a small grant that was obtained by one of MOHR's volunteers for a community hotline prior to Affirmation's formation. When MOHR questioned the need for a center such as Affirmations, the organization was moved to its second home a Detroit building owned by inaugural board members Sue Pittmann and Christine Puckett. Around 1990, the center moved to the Pioneer Building on West 9 Mile Road in Ferndale. During the organization's first two years, a group of volunteers operated a coming out group and a support and referral hotline for LGBT people. The center hired its first executive director, Jan Stevenson, an inaugural board member and later board president, in 1991 and expanded its programming to include hosting local LGBT groups and a program for local LGBT youth, funded by a gift from the estate of Carl Rippberger following his death. The center opened an art gallery in 1992 named after Pittmann and Puckett, who were murdered in May 1992 in an apparent hate crime by a neighbor. Stevenson resigned in 1995 to become publisher of Between the Lines. She was succeeded by Julie Enzer and Cindy Woodbury. Leslie Thompson became executive director in 2000, expanded programming to include health services and civic engagement, and oversaw the construction and opening of a new building to house the center. Thompson resigned in August 2010, following two years of financial difficulties for the center. In 2001, the center conducted a feasibility study on the possibility of constructing a new building to serve as its home. A capital campaign was launched in 2004 with a goal of , and successfully completed in 2006, raising , with support from Allan Gilmour, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, and General Motors. On June 3, 2007, the center moved into its new facility on West 9 Mile Road in Ferndale. Antonio David Garcia became executive director in August 2011, and he expanded recreation and advocacy efforts. The center coordinated a cross-state bike trip to raise awareness of LGBT issues and organized a statewide network of LGBT community centers. Garcia resigned in October 2013 and departed in February 2014. At the end of 2013, the organization received an anonymous bequest of . In March 2015, Darrious Hilmon became executive director. He resigned in October 2015 and was replaced in December 2015 by Susan Erspamer, who served until March 2018. Affirmations entered a period of restructuring after the departure of Susan Erspamer, leading to a new era for Affirmations. After being at the LA LGBT Center from his departure until 2019, Antonio David Garcia returned to the helm as Executive Director in May of 2019.  Activities  Affirmations offers services and multi-use facility space to the LGBT population in its surrounding communities. The center's services include counseling, support groups, get out the vote efforts, and a youth program, known as the Carl Rippberger Youth Empowerment Program, which provides a drop- in center and peer education program. The organization is a member of CenterLink.  Facility  The center operates out of a facility on West 9 Mile Road in Ferndale. The facility was designed to be environmentally friendly and includes a cyber center, a two-story art gallery, an outdoor rooftop sky deck, and a library.

He spent most of his life in the treatment and rehabilitation of leprosy patients and initiated a mobile leprosy treatment methodology, Clinic under the trees. On 13 September 1975, Government of Belgium honoured Hemerijckx by issuing a commemorative stamp, depicting his image. (9615) Hemerijckx, a Main-belt comet discovered in 1993 by Eric Walter Elst is named after the Flemish doctor. Biography Frans Hemerijckx was born on 18 August 1902 at Ninove in the Flemish province of Belgium to Leonie Steenhoudt and Theofiel Hemerijckx, a candle manufacturer, as the eldest of their four children. He did his early education at St. Catherine's College, Geraardsbergen and secured a medical degree from the Catholic University of Leuven after which he specialized in tropical medicine at Brussels. His career started in 1929 when he was sent to Kasai, a leprosy endemic region in Belgian Congo (present day Democratic Republic of the Congo). Reaching there with his fianc√©, Hemerijckx opened a Leprosy Centre in Tshumbe where patients could live with their families as the first step of rehabilitating them. He started an ambulatory service in the region for wider coverage and started using the then newly discovered sulpha drugs such as Dapsone and also opened another leprosy centre at Dikungu. He stayed in Congo for 25 years and by the time he returned to Belgium, the centre he had founded at Tshumbe had grown to be largest in the country. Service in India Hemerijckx, while on a holiday in Belgium in 1954, had an audience with King Leopold III who informed him of the newly opened Belgian Leprosy Centre in India which was in need of a leprosy specialist. He accepted the offer and persuaded Claire Vellut, another Belgian physician, to accompany him to India where the duo established a leprosy centre at Polambakkam, a small village with high concentration of leprosy patients, near Kancheepuram in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu on 9 July 1955. There they started an ambulatory service, which later came to be known as Clinic under the trees, a mobile medical service where the treatment was dispensed from makeshift camps set up under the trees. Hemerijckx carried on with the mobile service for five years till the local government took over the system in 1960, placing it under Claire Vellut. In 1961, he was associated with the World Health Organization and prepared several reports on leprosy for the organization, the notable among them is a series, Leprosy problem in India, a detailed study on the disease covering several states of India. In 1964, when Fr. Obbels and Jacques Vellut started the forum, Friends of Father Damien, Hemerijckx joined forces to found the Damien Foundation, now renamed as Action Damien. He remains as one of the inspirations behind the foundation whose activities soon spread across the world and Claire Vellut founded the Damien Foundation Trust India in 1992. In 1965, he returned from India and settled at his native place in Grimbergen but continued his associations with the Indian and Congo operations. By 1967, his health failed and he underwent an oesophagus surgery in Paris. When the leprosy centre in Polambakkam was renamed as Hemerijckx Government Leprosy Centre, he could not attend the function due to ill health. He died on 14 October 1969, at the age of 67, at Leuven, Belgium. Personal life Hemerijckx's first marriage was in Belgian Congo during his first trip to that country but it was short lived; his wife died during pregnancy while they were settling in the country. He married again and the couple had five children. One of his sons, Shilanand Hemraj, is a theologist and writer.

Reception The Allmusic review states: ‚Äú On his 2008 Nonesuch Records debut, Argentine pianist/composer Fernando Otero deftly blends elements of jazz and classical music into a foundation of tango, making for a highly inventive and engaging sound. Many of Otero's pieces feature emotive violin and cello lines, bringing to mind the Kronos Quartet (see the tense \\"De Ahora En Mas\\"), yet his subtle piano work and the frequent presence of the bandoneon, an instrument somewhat similar to the accordion, give the tracks a more peaceful and playful feel (the swaying \\"Musica De Circo\\").

The Governor of Antalya (Turkish: Antalya Valiliƒüi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Antalya. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Antalya is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Antalya. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Antalya provincial police force and the Antalya Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Antalya is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Antalya is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Antalya. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Antalya, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Antalya Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Antalya has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

It was erected at the northern edge of the historic center of Freiburg im Breisgau next to the former Karlskaserne (barracks). After World War II it was moved 100m to the west. Nowadays, the Siegesdenkmal is under conversation.  History  copperplate engraving from the magazine Die Gartenlaube von 1877 the fallen \\"Siegesg√∂ttin\\" The Siegesdenkmal is dedicated to the XIV Corps (German Empire) of the German army, in which mostly soldiers from Baden served. Under the command of General August von Werder the battles at Montb√©liard in 1871 ended in victory. In the general mood of victory, funds were raised in Baden (with cities from L√∂rrach to Karlsruhe participating), to erect a statue in the middle of Baden. A public competition was organized among the sculptors in Germany for a design of the statue. Whereby, some artists were explicitly invited to participate. The jury consisted of five artists and art connoisseurs: * Ernst Julius H√§hnel from Dresden * Wilhelm L√ºbke from Stuttgart * Eduard Magnus from Berlin * Friedrich Pecht a court painter from Munich * Gottfried Semper from Vienna The winner amongst the 18 competitors is Karl Friedrich Moest, a sculptor working at the art academy of Karlsruhe. He was then also in charge of the realization of the monument. Professor Caspar von Zumbusch from Munich and Reinhold Begas from Berlin earned second and third places respectively. Their models were displayed in the city's Augustiner Museum.Die Modelle befinden sich heute nicht mehr Augustinermuseum, daf√ºr jedoch die Entwurfszeichnungen von Karl Friedrich Moest (D 0148, D 0148 b und Zeichnung G 2744) Joint second place went to the sculptor Josef Alois Knittel from Freiburg im Breisgau, whose son Gustav Adolf Knittel later on became the master student of Moest and was involved in the construction of the Siegesdenkmal.Michael Klant: Die K√ºnstlerfamilie Knittel in: Freiburger Biographien, Promo-Verlag, Freiburg im Breisgau 2002, , S. 173-180 The sculptural and ornamental elements were made in the Bildgie√üerei (\\"casting house\\") of Lenz in N√ºrnberg and the work on the granite was conducted by local sculptor Alberto Luratti. For the decoration of the monument gun barrels from the defeated enemy were used. The total production cost amounted to 85,000 gold marks. The monument was inaugurated on October, 3rd, 1876. At the inauguration Emperor Wilhelm I, Grand Duke Frederick I and his wife Louise, Imperial Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and August von Werder himself, among others, resided as guests of honor. When the government was collecting metal in 1940, Robert Heinrich Wagner, the Gauleiter (district leader) on the Upper Rhine (Baden and Alsace), requested the monument to be given to Adolf Hitler as a birthday present. This request was denied by the city administration. In 1944, November, 4th, the monument survived a bombing even though the barracks of the Karlsbau, which are situated directly next to the monument, were entirely destroyed. The west wing of the building was rebuilt between 1950 and 1951. Nowadays, it houses the city's social welfare and youth welfare office. In 1948, the request by the German Peace Society and Bund der Kriegsgegner (German Pacifist Union) to remove the monument was denied.\\"Beschlussvorlage Stadtbahn und Umgestaltung Werhmannstra√üe, Rotteckring- und Friedrichring\\", Drucksache G-11/033, Town council meeting on 15 March 2011, retrieved on 17 September 2013, Ratsinfo- und B√ºrgerinfosystem der Stadtverwaltung Freiburg im Breisgau In 1961, the monument was moved 100 m westwards as it had become an obstacle on the newly built city highway.

From 1278 to 1783, Augustinian monks lived in the buildings. It has a preserved Gothic cloister, and has housed the local art museum \\"Augustinermuseum\\" since 1923.  History  The Sculpture Hall with the prophets from the cathedral When first built, the Augustinian monastery belonged to the German Ecclesiastical province. After the division of the province in 1299 it became part of a new province, The Rhenic Swabian Province, which included part of Switzerland, Swabia, Alsace, and the Rhineland up to the city of Mainz. In 1781 it changed hands again, when the Austrian government ordered four monasteries in Further Austria to form their own province (Further Austrian Province). The government forbade contact with the Superior General of the Augustinians when the former Prior of Konstanz was appointed as the Director (1782).He was appointed later on appointed as the Provincial Superior (1789). Since the city of Freiburg considered the monasteries of the mendicant orders as their own, because the members of the monastic orders originated from Freiburg, the monasteries were dependent on the city as well. As specified in the German mediatization the monastery was closed in 1803 and the buildings were put to other use: The nave of the former Augustinian church was used as one of Germany¬¥s first local theaters, which was housed there from 1823 to 1910. When the local theater opened the doors of its own building in 1910, the use of the nave no longer necessary. From 1874 on, the city stored its antiquities in the monastery, but most of the other buildings on the grounds were either neglected or were used as a school building or as an ammunition dump for the troops of Baden. When Max Wingenroth was designated the new director of the museum, it was decided to house the museum in the former monastery. In the beginning it was only called the municipal museum of Freiburg, but later on, with the addition of the city¬¥s art collection, it became known as the Augustiner Museum. This way, one of the oldest and finest buildings of the city was preserved. Since the building complex is one of the last from the Middle Ages there is still a large amount of historical structure and every now and then pieces dating from the Gothic era are found. Discoveries in the basement of the museum suggest that there were earlier settlements in the area. On the original site seven buildings were destroyed to build the monastery at the beginning of the 14th century and only one building was retained, it is likely that there was a monastery there before today¬¥s was built.New entrance 2006  Building history  In 1278, Count Egino II authorized the construction of the monastery along with a church in the area between the Salzstra√üe and the city walls. The deed of foundation, dated December 6, shows that the Augustinian monks were already resident in Freiburg. In 1299, the bishop of Strassburg, Conrad de Lichtenberg, consecrated the Augustinian church. The construction of the monastery was started later at the beginning of the 14th century. Because of a delivery note from 1332 it is known that sandstone from the nearby Lorettoberg was used for the construction. Renovations and newly constructed buildings from the 17th and 18th century in the Baroque style, as well as more modifications in the 20th century, changed the original plan of the grounds. For example, in 1706 the ceiling of the nave was raised and 10 new oval windows were added. As a further part of the modification two new chapels were installed and the original monastery along with the vestry were renovated.http://www.kloester- bw.de/klostertexte.php?kreis=&bistum;=&alle;=&ungeteilt;=&art;=&orden;=&orte;=&buchstabe;=&nr;=343&thema;=Geschichte In 1784,Herman von Greiffenegg ordered eight Augustinian padres to move to the Franciscan friary on behalf of Emperor Joseph II. They had to take over the responsibility of the newly founded second parish St.Martin. On the other hand, the Franciscan friars who originally lived in the Fransican monastery moved to the Augustinian.Peter Kalchthaler, Kleine Freiburger Stadtgeschichte, Verlag Friedrich Pustet, Regensburg 2006 Further renovations were started in 2006, which changed the outer appearance of the buildings again. A new entrance with a foyer was added to the west front towards the Augustinerplatz and columns were added to the former nave. Also a gallery was added that goes all around. The basement and attic were reconstructed and used as exhibition rooms. This renovation was finished in 2010.  Notable former members  Some well known members of the monastic order in Freiburg were: * Tilmann Limperger (*1485-‚Ä†1490) Prior in Freiburg, provincial superior, professor and repeated dean of the University. In 1498 he became the titular bishop of Tripolis and the suffragan bishop of Basel. He preached the first reformed sermon in the Basel Minster in 1529. * Engelbert Kl√ºpfel (*1733 - ‚Ä†1811), a student from 1754 to 1756, dogmatic theology professor at the University of Freiburg * Thomas Zeni (1707), plasterer and architect * Thomas Zipfeli, in 1787 he became the Prior and chaplain at St.Martin constructed a city map of Freiburg  Research  When in 1982 an archaeological examination of the latrine was performed, glass, pottery, wood, leather and textiles were found. Researchers dated them back to the late 13th to the 15th century. The finds are important examples of the handcraft of earlier times. The leather discoveries give a good impression of the monastery shoemaking, the glass and pottery show what kind of tableware the monastery owned, and the tools made of wood were still in good condition. Furthermore, the discoveries give an impression of the waste disposal of the time. The insights were documented in the magazine published by the group for protection of monuments Baden-W√ºrttembergDie Latrine des Augustinereremiten-Klosters in Freiburg im Breisgau, Matthias Untermann et al.,1995, Theiss Verlag  References   Bibliography  Van Uffelen, Chris.

Umm al-Hiran (, ) is a Bedouin village settled by the Abu Alkian tribe located in the Wadi Atir area of the Negev desert in southern Israel. Located near Hura, the village was established in 1956 and is one of 46 unrecognized Bedouin villages in Israel. History During and following the 1948 war and the establishment of the state of Israel, a large number of Bedouin tribes were displaced, including the Abu Alkian tribe. They were corralled into an area known as Siyag to the northeast of Beersheba, which was designated a closed military zone, barring Bedouins from accessing their original land. In 1956, the tribe approached the military administration and was transferred to the Wadi Atir area, where they received 7,000 dunams of land near the wadi. There, they settled in two villages Umm al-Hiran and Atir. From this point onwards, they built houses from stone and other materials, paved roads, built wells and farmed the surrounding land. Sheikh Farhoud Abu al Qi'an argued that before their arrival \\"It was a desert, with no roads, water, houses or services\\". In 2001, the Israel Land Authority described its residents as a \\"special obstacle\\" in its recommendations. In 2003, there was a state motion to the Magistrates‚Äô Court in Beersheba for the demolition of the village ex parte, without informing the landowners; the state claimed that it was unable to identify or reach the inhabitants. In 2004, the state filed lawsuits in 2004 to evacuate the villagers on the basis that they were trespassers who were squatting illegally. The court ruled that the legal status of the residents was as \\"permanent residents\\", but at the same time concluded that because the land was held from the state free of charge, their residency could be revoked at any time. The Prime Minister's Office had also previously blocked a plan to recognise the neighbouring village of Atir, which shares land with Umm al-Hiran, requesting instead that the plan did not clash with the proposal to establish a Jewish town. The proposal would relocate the Bedouins of Umm al-Hiran to the Bedouin township of Hura, one of seven Bedouin townships, all of which are at the bottom of the country's socio-economic index. These townships are specifically designated towns intended to \\"contain\\" expelled Bedouins. They are characterised by being overcrowded, lacking in adequate services and having the highest percentage of unemployment and poverty in Israel. The authorities are supported by key NGOs, including the Or Movement, which works to promote the construction of Hiran. Opposition to the plan to forcibly evict and demolish the village of Umm al-Hiran has come from both non-governmental organisations and left-leaning MKs. Arab MKs have requested an overall solution to the Arab and Bedouin housing problem in Israel, including a freeze on all pending demolition and eviction orders. Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, made the housing crisis and treatment of Bedouins his party's top priority following the March 2015 elections. Other MKs have also come out in opposition to the plan, including MK Tamar Zandberg from Meretz, who argued \\"How will we be able to explain how we razed a village‚Ä¶ just because the people belong to a different ethnic or religious group?\\" Adalah launched a public campaign entitled \\"#save_UmmAlHiran\\", in order to \\"stop Israel's plan to demolish an Arab Bedouin village in order to build a Jewish town over its ruins\\". The Regional Council of the Unrecognised Villages has also been active in campaigning to stop the destruction of the village, arguing the plan amounts to an \\"ethnic cleansing\\" campaign. Proposed demolition Houses demolition in Umm al- Hiran Two legal proceedings were started against the villagers of Umm al-Hiran by the State Attorney; one to evacuate the village, and one to demolish the village itself. A petition from late May 2015 was rejected by the Supreme Court, with Justice Elyakim Rubinstein arguing that the petition was an indirect attack against the establishment of the new Jewish town, Hiran, a challenge which should be raised elsewhere. It was further argued that the government's action did not violate the community's legal rights, and that the \\"proportionate harm\\" that would be caused by the evictions and demolitions was within acceptable boundaries. Furthermore, members of the Knesset voted 24‚Äì1 against sending the issue of Umm al-Hiran to its Internal Affairs and Environment Committee. The newly appointed Justice Minister, Ayelet Shaked, argued that the demolitions did not reflect discrimination against Bedouins or Arabs, but that since the village was unrecognised, its residents were not eligible for any compensation. Supreme Court Justice Daphne Barak Erez criticised the government's actions, arguing that it should reconsider the proposed compensation, given the Bedouins had lived in Umm al-Hiran for decades. She proposed considering offering a plot in the new town for the existing residents. On 11 June 2015, hundreds of protesters attended a demonstration against the destruction of Umm al-Hiran in Beersheba. They marched from the town's open-air Bedouin market to the city's government buildings. The demonstration was attended by Joint List MKs Ahmad Tibi, Hanin Zoabi and Taleb Abu Arar. In 2015 Neve Gordon wrote of his impressions of the contrast between the two communities. The community that is to form the projected village of Hiran consists of roughly 30 religious families living in a gated community in a Jewish National Fund Forest some kilometres away from the Bedouin village. They are former West Bank settlers who, he states, 'have returned to Israel to colonise Bedouin land. The rooster has come back home to roost.'Neve Gordon, 'Israel's war on liberal democracy,' Al Jazeera 4 March 2016.  Killing of Yacoub Abu Al-Qia'an  Before dawn on January 18, 2017 when Israeli police officers and a Green Patrol of the Israel Land Authority arrived at the village to demolish homes. They were met by a large group of protesters. A villager, the 47-year-old school teacher Yacoub Abu Al-Qia‚Äôan, was shot by police while driving away from the scene, and his car subsequently careened into a group of police, ramming and killing an officer. Abu Al-Qia'an was left unattended and bled to death. In the immediate aftermath, several Israeli politicians and police officials falsely accused Abu Al-Qia'an of having been a terrorist affiliated with the Islamic State. In 2020, his name was cleared as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others apologized for making him out to be a terrorist. The police and the State Prosecutor were faulted for covering up evidence that would have cleared Abu Al-Qia‚Äôan's name sooner, among other things. Etymology The village is named after the Hiran Valley that passes near the village, as well as the adjacent Hiran mountain. Geography Umm al-Hiran-Atir is located in the Wadi Atir area of the Negev desert, eight kilometres north-east of the Bedouin township of Hura. It is part of the same valley as Susiya, a Palestinian village in the West Bank at risk of demolition. Demographics In 2015 the population of the village was just over 1,000, having grown from around 200 in 1956 when it was established. The community of Umm al-Hiran is part of the Abu al Qi'an tribe, originally from Khirbet Zubaleh and belong to the Sunni branch of Islam. Economy Residents work primarily in two industries; construction (specifically in paving roads) and as manpower contractors, cleaning hospitals and working in factories. Education The children of Umm al-Hiran attend school in Hura.

Bhakkar is located in the west of Punjab on the border of Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa. The mighty Indus River flows on the Western side of the District which plays havoc during monsoon season and the Jehlum and Chenab rivers both flow on the eastern side they also sometimes plays havoc during monsoon season. One third of the land is sandy of which small portion is irrigated by Thal canal. Rest of the sandy land is cultivated and is entirely dependent upon rains. People mostly depend on agriculture which is highly dependent on rain falls. As such people are poor, backward and traditional. Education and health facilities are not adequately available.  History The origins of Basti Islamabad according to tradition go back fifty five years. The village was named by founded by Maulana Muhammad Abdurehman in 1961. There is evidence that suggests that a state by this name existed during Alexander's invasion of the sub-continent. The Arabs however called it Manker Kot, and during Muhammad bin Qasim's rule in greater Sindh, the conquest of Mankera by one of his generals, Abul Asswad bin Zahar is recorded. The first Muslim governor of Mankera was Ahmed bin Khuzema who died in Mankera and is buried in Mankera fort. Map of Ancient State Mankera. Following the downfall of Arab rule in Sindh, the Hindu king of Kanauj took possession of Mankera followed by the Mekan. The Abdali kings annexed Mankera and the adjoining areas and the Baloch gave way to Saddo Zai Pathans. The Pathan rule of the state ended with the famous siege of Mankera by Ranjit Singh which resulted in the forfeiture of Nawab Surbuland's claim to Mankera and his retreat to Dera Ismail Khan. Mankera fort, the principal feature of the town lies half a kilometre to the left of the Bhakkar highway. The fort was constructed in two phases. The initial construction of the brick fort was carried out during the time of the Baloch rule, and further fortification in the form of a thick mud wall was undertaken during the Pathan rule. Today the fort and its fortification is mostly in ruins. (Much to my surprise, Mankera's historical sites have never been considered worthy of any official recognition.) The major part of the mud wall still exists, however decay and neglect is abundantly clear. The main fort is mostly in ruins except for a well, a tomb, and a few signs of masonry. The outer walls of the citadel are however intact. During the dying days of the Mughal empire, Mankera's Saddo Zai rulers with the help of their Abdali benefactors emerged as a force to reckon with in this area. Mankera was the seat of their dominions. Nowadays the Tomb of Mankera is not in the good condition and is broken at all the places and the walls. The Sikh occupation of Mankera is abundantly evident. Next to the Jamia Masjid of Mankera are the ruins of a temple built during the Sikh rule, and even the tomb of Nawab Surbuland Khan, just outside the main citadel has a Hindu aura about its construction. The Sikh annexation of this area began in 1821, and was completed with the fall of Mankera in the autumn of that year. Ranjit Singh personally led the troops that besieged Mankera. The siege lasted for twenty- two days and at a great cost to the invaders. Mankera, fortified by the brick wall had a distinct advantage of its position being in the middle of a desert. The besieging army had not only to deal with the gallant musketry of the Mankera troops but had to find out ways to deal with the natural difficulties as well. Water had to be carried for the troops from considerable distances. Ranjit Singh's ingenuity saved the day, as he ordered his army to dig several wells. Twelve such wells were dug. The siege dragged on for twenty-two days during which time the Nawab held his own; however the desertions of his sardars and the demolition of one of the minarets of Jamia Masjid‚Äîtaken as a bad omen‚Äîforced the Nawab to surrender the fort to the Sikhs. The iron ball shot from the big guns, including the Zam Zama employed by Ranjit Singh during the Mankera expedition is still preserved in the mosque's compound. Following the surrender, the Muslim population of Mankera was expelled and replaced by Sikhs and Hindus, and the area was put under the direct control of the Lahore empire. The Sikh rule of Mankera ended in 1847 and for the next one hundred and forty years Mankera existed as a non-entity. Mankera's other claim to fame is the incident, which took place in 1794 when Prince Hummayun Shah, son of Taimur Shah, the Abdali King and a claimant to the throne of Kabul, made a vain attempt to overthrow his brother, Zaman Shah. His brother comprehensively defeated him and Hummayun fled to Thal Sagar. The Saddo Zai Nawab of Mankera, Nawab Mohammad Khan, apprehended him at Leaih. Hummayun's son was killed in the scuffle that followed his arrest, and at the behest of Zaman Shah, Nawab had Hummayun's eyes put out. Hummayun spent the rest of his life imprisoned in Mankera fort. A tomb in the middle of the fort is believed to be that of Prince Hummayun, and is considered a minor saint by the locals. On the other hand, the Nawab received the title of Surbuland Khan and the territory of Dera Ismail Khan from the King. It was the same Surbuland Khan who had to surrender to Ranjit Singh some twenty-and-seven years later, and retreat to Dera Ismail Khan.

The project includes an ongoing series of framed pages which contain one or several reproductions of the work Fountain by Marcel Duchamp. Here Afif uses the concept of the Objet trouv√©s (found object) and tears off the pages from different publications. For each publication and pages Afif normally makes only one piece for the Fountain Archives, which is created as a work of art. The Fountain Archive also includes a bookshelf which stores all used publications of the project. Origin and description Fountain, 1917, signed \\"R. Mutt\\" In 2008 Sa√¢dane Afif started to collect publications which contain reproductions of the work Fountain (1917) by Marcel Duchamp. After he was distinguished with the Marcel Duchamp Prize in 2009, Afif began the Fountain Archive. At present the Fountain Archive contains over 600 images of Duchamp‚Äôs porcelain urinal. In this work, Afif collects and archives every publication in which he finds a reproduction of Duchamp's urinal. As a ‚Äúfound object‚Äù every page containing the picture of the Fountain is torn out and then carefully framed. The frame (sometimes with a colored background), used for its preservation and highlight ornament purposes, is also part of the making process. Every step of the archiving follows meticulous rules which participate entirely in the making process of these works of art. For each publication and page Afif normally makes only one piece for the Fountain Archive.Valentina Vlasic: Sa√¢dane Afif, in: The Present Order is the Disorder of the Future, Schriftenreihe Museum Kurhaus Kleve ‚Äì Ewald Matar√©-Sammlung Nr. 62, Freundeskreis Museum Kurhaus und Koekkoek-Haus Kleve e.V. (Hrsg), 2013, p. 57. If a publication contains images of Duchamp‚Äôs Fountain on several pages, all of them are torn off and form together a polyptych. When found, the publications are registered with an archive number ranging from FA 0001 potentially to infinite. Afif intended to continue the Series of Archives until its 1001st. The publications (sans Fountain) are then stored in a bookshelf in the studio of the artist. The bookshelf creates an archive around Duchamp‚Äôs Fountain, from which the common initiator has been removed: ‚Äúan archive without its object‚Äú. The Fountain Archives has been presented in various exhibitions throughout the world. Since 2013, some publications presenting this project by Afif happened to reproduce the work Fountain of Duchamp. Those specific documents are also incorporated in the Fountain Archives project. But they are treated as special objects as they are doubled in order to testify of a historical echo, mark a mise en abyme. In case of the mise en abyme ‚Äì a publication includes an image of Afif's Fountain Archive project ‚Äì there is also one exception to the strict rule that each publication produced only a unique, singular work of the Fountain Archive.Elena Filipovic, Xavier Hufkens: S√¢adane Afif. Fontaines. Triangle Books, 2014, , p. 21. These pages underline an evolution in the development and perception of the Fountain Archives as an artwork. They are stored under a specific section titled ‚ÄúAugmented‚Äù, and they are building a step-by-step archive within the archive. Therefore, two copies of the publications (sans Fountain) enter the archive bookshelf and two editions of the work are made. History In 2013 a group of 101 Fountain Archives were shown in the exhibition ‚ÄúThe Present Order is the Disorder of the Future‚Äù based in the Museum Kurhaus Kleve. Referring to the presentation a first text, by the art historic Valentina Vlasic, about the Fountain Archive was published in the exhibition catalogue. This catalogue contribution included a picture of Duchamp‚Äôs Fountain, therefore Afif tears the page off and makes an augmented fountain archive out of it. This said Klever Fountain, with the description FA 0366, is based in the collection of the Museum Kurhaus Kleve as a permanent loan. Interpretations The German art historian Eva Huttenlauch named Marcel Duchamp as Afif‚Äôs guiding star, he looked up as his ideal self. Many of Afif‚Äôs concepts, like the Fountain Archive, rest on the foundations Duchamp laid.Eva Huttenlauch: Everything must be scandalous, in: Sa√¢dane Afif. Another Anthology of Black Humor, published by Susanne Gaensheimer and Eva Huttenlauch, Verlag f√ºr Moderne Kunst, N√ºrnberg 2012, p. 79. The Austrian art historian Valentina Vlasic termed Afif‚Äôs Fountain Archive as a repetition of the key-moment of the ready-made, the fundamental act of selecting which just as it did at that time for Duchamp, represents a complete artistic achievement. Afif does not do this with real objects, like a normal commercial one, but he uses the artistic object of the Fountain as an illustration from publications. As a charming witticism, Vlasic predicated that there is in addition the fact that Afif leads Duchamp‚Äôs Fountain in a new way back into the museum, a site it had to leave about one hundred years ago through being excluded from the exhibition. For the art historian Elena Filipovic, the high importance of Duchamp‚Äôs Fountain in art history accrued especially because of the reason that the artist understood very well that the reproduction, display, framing, dissemination, and reception of an artwork not only constructs its value and meaning, but also help determine how and if it enters history at all. This comprehension stands also for the background of Sa√¢dane Afif's project of the Fountain Archives. After ‚ÄúR.Mutt‚Äú or Marcel Duchamp Filipovic sees in Afif another person which adopts the white urinal and also conducts the construction of an icon. The Fountain Archives, which contain an image of a Fountain Archive (mise en abyme), is termed as a ‚Äúremake‚Äù by Filipovic. She compares especially these works with the process of signification of Duchamp‚Äôs Fountain in art history.Elena Filipovic, Xavier Hufkens: S√¢adane Afif. Fontaines.

History Luxford house was constructed in the early 16th century as a smoke bay house. During the 1930s it was bought by Sir Hugh Beaver, former Ministry of Works director general and founder of the Guinness Book of Records, who renovated and extended it. It was Grade II listed on 26 November 1953. Following Beaver's death in 1967, ownership of the house passed to his daughter Cerise and son-in-law, Rev Christopher Lawson-Tancred. It was let to rock music manager Tony Stratton Smith who lived there through the early 1970s. He encouraged groups signed to his label, Charisma Records, including Genesis and Van der Graaf Generator, to rehearse there. Genesis wrote their 1971 album Nursery Cryme at Luxford House that summer. A picture of Van der Graaf Generator taken at the house appeared on the inner gatefold sleeve of their 1971 album Pawn Hearts, and the cover of Neil Diamond's album Stones also uses a picture taken on the property‚Äîof a stone wall‚Äîas its cover. Bert Jansch recorded his 1974 album L.A. Turnaround at Luxford House, using the library as the live room, and made a promotional video featuring the premises. In December 2017, the property and estate was put on the market. Architecture Luxford house is set in a estate with several lawns and gardens.

Championed by Austin-based singer Dale Watson, the ameripolitan genre was established for contemporary artists upholding traditional roots-influenced musical formats to distinguish themselves from the formats produced by the mainstream country pop music industry. The Ameripolitan Music Awards were founded in 2014.  Origin  Dale Watson The Ameripolitan term was coined by Dale Watson and Wisconsin promoter, Phil Doran, after finding it difficult to describe the style of music that Watson and some of his select peers play, contending that predefined genres fail to properly categorize it. Labeling it country music, they felt, is misleading relative to the conjured links and attributes as defined by Music Row's country pop music industry. Calling it classic country implies it is retro, rather than new and original. The traditional country label is loosely defined and the perceived definition is often relative to the age of the listening audience. The Americana genre has prominent folk and rock influences and omits the outlaw, rockabilly, hillbilly, western swing and Cajun sounds perfected by traditionalists. Watson believes the entire country music nomenclature has been irrevocably corrupted beyond repair, insisting the newly created Ameripolitan music genre helps rebrand, honor and preserve contemporary music rooted in the earlier traditions of country music. Rebranding efforts heightened after reported remarks were made by contemporary country pop singer, Blake Shelton, during his appearance on an episode of GAC Backstory: Though Shelton later apologized for the comment, his remarks, Watson felt, let the \\"proverbial cat out of the bag\\" and set the internet abuzz with regard to the true feelings of Music Row and the roots of country music, further fueling the fire to rebrand the Ameripolitan music genre, designed to honor and preserve the roots of Country music.

The battle ended with the complete victory of the Greeks. Prelude In August 1821, Greeks began the siege of Tripolitsa. The Ottomans who were besieged in the city attempted several night sallies in order to find supplies. When Theodoros Kolokotronis was called by the besiegers to take over command of the siege, he therefore ordered the digging of a trench (grana) with a depth of one meter and a width of two meters running from Mytikas in the village of Benteni up to the hill near the village of Loukas where the chieftain Ioannis Dagres held the position. This whole project, which covered a distance of about 700 meters, was completed with personal work of the peasants of the region within three days and aimed at the interception of the Ottoman sorties.ŒùŒµœéœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ ŒïŒ≥Œ∫œÖŒ∫ŒªŒøœÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ ŒõŒµŒæŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ ŒóŒªŒØŒøœÖ, vol. 5, p. 632.Dionysios A.

Battle During the night of 9 to 10 August, an Ottoman force of 3000 infantry and cavalrymen sallied from Tripolitsa to Loukas hill in order to attack the force of Ioannis Dagres and also for their usual raid for supplies. After looting several villages in the wider area, they attacked Dagres' force at dawn, bringing the Greeks in a difficult position. Kolokotronis, realising the seriousness of the situation, ordered Plapoutas, Dimitrios Deligiannis, Papazafiropoulos, Christopoulos, George Aulakos and the armed Greeks of Tripolitsa to occupy positions within the trench, while he placed other forces behind the fences of the vineyards, as well as ordering any other troops to come to assistance. Moreover, in order to lessen the pressure on the trench, he ordered a diversionary attack by the forces of Demetrios Ypsilantis, Anagnostaras and Panagiotis Giatrakos.Dionysios A. Kokkinos, 1975, vol. 2, pp. 85‚Äì87. While the forces of Ali Bey had brought Dagres and his men in a difficult position, they realised the imminent danger and retreated in order to avoid being cut off. Reaching the trench, however, they found themselves confronted by the Greeks holding it, and the men of Dagres pursuing them in their rear. The Ottoman situation temporarily improved when the garrison cavalry came to their aid, but both the Ottoman foot troops and the cavalry suffered heavy losses as they tried to cross the trench. At the same time, new Ottoman forces left Tripolitsa in order to reinforce their comrades, leading to a general engagement on two fronts. Kolokotronis, followed by his bodyguard, moved between fronts encouraging his men. Eventually, the Ottomans caved in and retreated in disorder towards Tripolitsa. Losses During the battle, the Ottomans lost about 400 men. Most of them were killed during the failed attempt crossing the trench. Among the dead were several prominent Ottomans of Tripolitsa such as Abdul B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ± (son of the local lord Sheikh Tahir Efendi) and Kabƒ±r Kehaya, while Ali Bey died three days of his wounds. At the same time, all the carts with animals and food that were collected from looting that day were abandoned on the battlefield. On the Greek side, thirty men were killed, including the brother of Ioannis Dagres, Thanasis. There were several wounded, among whom were the minor leaders Apostolis Kolokotronis and Georgios Dritsas, who died a few days later. Aftermath The successful outcome of this battle for the Greek forces, contributed greatly to the acceleration of the subsequent capture of Tripolitsa by the Greek revolutionaries. The Ottomans suffered considerable losses, there was sharp decline in their morale, while they lost the ability to forage for supplies as before.Dionysios A. Kokkinos, 1975, vol. 2, pp. 87‚Äì88.

It is a tradition primarily from the German speaking parts of central Europe which appeared across the region in a variety of forms, chiefly though not exclusively in monasteries and churches. It was at its most widespread between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, and survived more strongly in Roman Catholic regions than in those areas that switched to protestantism, following the interventions of Martin Luther and others. German language terms used for the celebration include Christkindlwiegen: the verb included in that compound word, \\"wiegen\\", indicates both rocking/cradling and weighing/getting the measure of the baby. The celebration involved a form of congregational dancing accompanied by singing around a picture of Jesus placed on a crib or adjacent altar. The performance was led by the priests, and the singing, at least initially, appears to have consisted of duet sung by two priests.‚ÄúJoseph, lieber neve m√Æn, Hilf mir wiegen daz kindel√Æn. Gerne, liebe muome m√Æn, Hilf ich dir wiegen d√Æn kindel√Æn.‚Äù (The sources offer no explanation for the non-standard kinship relationships implicit in these words.) History The first surviving record of a \\"Kindelwiegenfeier\\" appears in \\"De investigatione Antichristi\\", produced in 1161/62 by Gerhoh, the Provost of the Augustinian Cannons at the Monastery of Reichersberg in Upper Austria. According to Gerhoh's description, the location of the ceremony was a monastery church and the participants were monks or \\"secular\\" clerics. The ceremony comprised the singing of several songs, from the book of hours and other unspecified liturgical sources, enriched with various drama-actions by the participants. In later centuries a wider level of congregation participation became the norm. Reformation By the fifteenth century the custom had spread to practically all the churches in Germany. During the sixteenth century it began to be rejected by the more hardline protestant congregations, however, which increasingly rejected the \\"Child Rocking\\" ceremony as one of the fruits of (\\"papist\\") superstition. Nevertheless, even in regions touched by the Protestant Reformation it took a long time for Christkindlwiegen to disappear entirely. Bach biographer Philipp Spitta describes the customs regarding the Kindleinwiegen in Protestant Leipzig before and after the City Council formally abolished the practice in 1702. He starts with a comment on a hymn in German that also uses some Latin words (Virga Jesse floruit, as used by the Leipzig composers Kuhnau and Bach for their Christmas compositions):Spitta 1884, p. 369 ff. Counter reformation There was throughout the centuries considerable variation concerning the details of the ceremony. Even in regions that remained staunchly catholic, as the Counter reformation took hold there was a reaction against some of the Medieval jollity of the earlier celebrations, and the image of Jesus tended to be removed from the crib and placed instead on the altar, which was felt to be more respectful. There was also increasingly use of \\"props\\" such as a Santa Claus doll to supervise proceedings. In another version, each of the young girls from the village dressed up and brought to church their own wax doll of the Baby Jesus. This provides a link to the Christmas nativity scene centred on the crib that became popular in the nineteenth century and remains a focus of Christmas decoration in many churches today. Another surviving link from the Christkindlwiegen custom is the Christmas song ,The melody for \\"Joseph, lieber Joseph mein\\" has supported a range of lyrics over the years, and there is no universally agreed \\"correct\\" version. It is better known to English language choirs by the Latin name Resonet in laudibus, and since the 1960s generally heard in an arrangement by David Willcocks. still popular in German speaking areas, and believed to have originated as one of the songs that would have accompanied the old ceremony.Eduard Hoffmann-Krayer (Ed.):Handw√∂rterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens. Vol 9, Col 878 Revival Although the Christkindlwiegen had generally fallen out of use by the start of the twentieth century, there have been revivals. On January 7, 2012 the Viennese Medieval music expert Eberhard Kummer marked the 850th anniversary of the ceremony's first surviving recorded mention with a revival performance in St Gertrude's Church at Klosterneuburg, a short distance upstream of Vienna. Proceedings involved two altar girls rocking the \\"Christchild\\" in his crib, to the accompaniment of authentic dancing. The ceremony took place again at Klosterneuburg in January 2013 and January 2014.

The brand launched in 2001, under the slogan of \\"Don't Accept Less Than More Than\\". More Than is known in the United Kingdom for its television advertising, including features such as More Than Freeman, Lucky The Dog and the Personal Project Manager ad. History More Than was launched as a subsidiary of Royal & Sun Alliance in 2001. Royal & Sun Alliance formed in 1996, following the merger of Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance.https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02339826 The insurance group set aside ¬£20 million in order to create the new More Than brand. Since its inception, the company has focused on developing small service teams to care for customers in a more personal way. The company also changed the way their call centres functioned by removing scripts, thus enabling claims handlers to actually talk to customers, and encouraged call centre staff to recommend suppliers from the More Than network in order to resolve a problem. In February 2008, it was announced that their parent company, Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group, would be rebranding to RSA Insurance Group. This however had no effect on any of their subsidiaries, including More Than. In 2013, More Than updated their brand promise to 'Where You Mean More' and became an official partner of the RSPCA. By March 2015, the insurance company had donated over ¬£260,000 to help unwanted or neglected animals in England and Wales as well as offering six weeks‚Äô free insurance to those who re home a pet from the RSPCA.

The ads looked like an appeal for information about a lost dog, with the aim of directing people to the website, WheresLucky.com. The advertising campaign, at drawing interest to the newly formed More Than brand. The success of early adverts, one of the first featured \\"Lucky\\" driving his owner‚Äôs car home without crashing it, led the brand to continue using Lucky for another five years. During this five year period, the company used the slogan, More Than Lucky. In March 2002, More Than announced their new ad agency would be Camp Chipperfield Hill Murray (CCHM). In March 2006, More Than aired their first television advert without Lucky, and the new slogan More Than ‚Äì We Do More. In February 2011, the insurance company launched a television advert starring Josh Robert Thompson replicating a similar voice, and speaking style to that of actor Morgan Freeman. The term \\"More Than Freeman\\" was used throughout the advert. In the years that have followed, the television adverts have focused on how More Than assists clients with a more personal touch. These have included the burglary advert, More Than Help, in 2013, which was later followed up with the advert Name Your Price and the advert Personal Project Manager, which aired in February 2015.

While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they have been administratively obsolete since 1898. However, they continue to be used in land registration and in specification, such as in planning permissions.

The Governor of Balƒ±kesir (Turkish: Balƒ±kesir Valiliƒüi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Balƒ±kesir. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Balƒ±kesir is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Balƒ±kesir. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Balƒ±kesir provincial police force and the Balƒ±kesir Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Balƒ±kesir is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Balƒ±kesir is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Balƒ±kesir. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Balƒ±kesir, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Balƒ±kesir Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Balƒ±kesir has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

Part Seven of the UAE Constitution declares Islam as the official state religion. In Dubai, the government appoints all imams, whether Sunni or Shia, as well as regulating religious sermon content preached in mosques. Shia mosques are designated by the government as private, but are able to apply for government funding upon request. Shia Muslims are granted freedom to worship, and maintain their mosques. Shias may also pursue family law cases through a special Shia council. Most Shias are concentrated in the emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah. Society Shia citizens in the UAE, a section of which are of Iranian origin, have historically been an important segment of the business community, as well as enjoying representation in the UAE's political establishment. In recent years, a small number of Shia Muslim expatriates have been deported from the UAE. Some Lebanese Shia families in particular have complained of deportation for allegedly harbouring sympathy for Hezbollah. According to some organizations, the number of such deportees is over 4,000.

Mostly remembered for training his son, International Boxing Hall of Fame member Felix Trinidad, Felix Trinidad Sr. nevertheless was a Featherweight boxer during the middle and late 1970s and the early 1980s, who fought the likes of Salvador Sanchez and Enrique Solis. Boxing career Trinidad Sr. began his professional boxer career by taking on 9-1 Nick Ortiz on March 31, 1975 in San Juan, losing by sixth-round knockout. Three weeks later, he got his first professional boxing win when he defeated a debutant, Francisco Sullivan, by a second-round knockout, also in San Juan. Trinidad Sr. lost two of his next three bouts and took time off boxing from 1976 to 1978, when he returned on January 14 with a victory over 1-2 Fernando Rivera by six rounds decision at Carolina, Puerto Rico. Trinidad Sr. followed that win with three more victories and then he was given a chance at winning the vacant Puerto Rican national featherweight title on November 27 of the same year-1978-as part of the undercard in which Solis lost to Eusebio Pedroza at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan for Pedroza's WBA world Featherweight title. His rival that night, the same Fernando Rivera that Trinidad Sr. had previously defeated, was by now 4‚Äì3 in seven bouts. Trinidad Sr. won the Puerto Rican national Featherweight title by outpointing Rivera again, this time over twelve rounds. Next, Trinidad Sr. had his first fight abroad, against up-and-comer, future WBC world Featherweight champion and International Boxing Hall of Fame member, 31-1-1 Salvador Sanchez. This bout took place on August 7, 1979 at The Summit in Houston, Texas, United States, and Trinidad Sr. lasted until the fifth round, when he was stopped by the young Mexican. A loss to Enrique Solis on December 18 by ninth-round knockout followed, then two more losses, one to future world title challenger, 14-1 Carlos Pinango by a knockout in round eight at Caracas, Venezuela on August 18, 1980, before Trinidad Sr. posted what would turn out to be his last win as a professional boxer, beating 7-2 Fernando Ortiz on January 29, 1981. On February 19, 1981, Trinidad Sr. defended his national Featherweight championship against debuting Dagoberto Agosto. In what would turn out to be his last fight, he lost to Agosto by a twelve-round decision. Trinidad Sr. retired with a record of 8 wins and 8 losses in 16 professional boxing bouts, 5 wins coming by way of knockout. During at least part of his career as a boxer, Trinidad Sr. sparred in a ring with another member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, Wilfred Ben√≠tez. Training career Early in 1990, Trinidad Sr. announced that his son, F√©lix Trinidad Jr., would begin a professional boxing career of his own instead of waiting for the 1992 Summer Olympics due to a dispute with the local amateur boxing authority. He was severely criticized by some on the national press, but the Trinidads went on with their plans. In 1993, F√©lix Trinidad Jr. became Trinidad Sr's first world boxing champion when he knocked out Maurice Blocker in two rounds to win the IBF's world Welterweight title. Eight years later, Trinidad Sr. led Nelson Dieppa to a world championship also. In addition to those two boxers, he also trained his nephew, Juan Gomez Trinidad, Fres Oquendo and Felix Flores. Trinidad Sr. also acted as his son's manager. In 2000, he won the Al Buck Award as the Boxing Writers Association of America's \\"manager of the year\\". Hand-wraps controversy Before his son's fight with Bernard Hopkins on September 29, 2001, Trinidad Sr. wrapped his hands in order to put boxing gloves on them. Hopkins' trainer Nazim Richardson argued that the hand- wrapping technique used by Trinidad Sr. was illegal in New York City, the place where the fight took place. Richardson and Hopkins refused to get into the ring until Trinidad Jr's hands were re-wrapped. This in turn led to a large amount of rumors about Trinidad Sr. In the end, however, it was clarified that Trinidad Sr. was not giving his son an unfair advantage, and Trinidad Sr. and his son were allowed to compete in New York again.

Life  From age 6 to 13 (between 1987 and 1994) he learned and played the violin at the Rudolf Steiner School (Waldorf education) in Pratteln and visited regularly the violin lessons at the Musikschule Basel. At the age of 13 (In 1994), Amadeus came in contact with the then emerging Techno movement in Basel, through his sister. To satisfy his newly developed interest in electronic music, he learned to play the keyboard at the Musikhaus & Musikschule Bonvicini in Basel, as an introduction to the use of synthesizers and studio technology. At that time (around 1995), he began to build a small pre- production studio in the basement of his family home. His former equipment included, among others, an Akai S1100, a Korg Prophecy, a Roland JV-90, a Yamaha QS-300 and some analog classics, e.g. a Roland TB-303 or Roland JX-3P. Starting in 1996, he began working on first contracts for events and multimedia applications, amongst others, through the company of his father W.P.P. expo & event. In order to expand his knowledge, he completed an internship with Daniel Platisa in his Basel based Q-Lab Studio, in the same year. At the age of 17 (in 1997), he founded his own company Amadeus Paulussen Sounddesign, which he later renamed kubus media. His desire to get a monitor system of Klein + Hummel for a trial period at his own studio, required him to present a registered business and this was the reason to found his company at such tender age. The O 100 / O 800 - monitor system is still in operation today in kubus media studio (2015). He published in 1999, together with Daniel Sgubin (DJ Mystery), a first production in a vinyl small series, on a sub- label of DJ Beat (a Swiss vinyl records-chain): Modular Records. Further vinyl releases did follow, with Tihomir Markovic under the pseudonym Pushing Elementz, on the Label Limiter Records. More vinyl and digital releases followed on with Francesco Cal√≠, under the name Paulussen & Cali on DJ C-Rock's Label Lo-Fi Stereo. At the time Christian Rindermann (aka C-Rock) published artists like Ricardo Villalobos, Neville Attree, Steve Bug or Motorcitysoul on his label. In the years 2002-2015, as managing director of kubus media, he could perform numerous jobs, with his team, including Michael Studer among others, in the area of corporate sound for clients such as Swisscom, ALPA, David Klein and Basler Versicherungsgesellschaft. In 2011 he was introduced to the Bern based company PANArt and its instrument, the Hang, through his mother and wife. Today he plays the successor instrument together with his wife, the Gubal, and integrates it regularly in his still electronically-oriented Productions. Since 2014 he runs the kubus media studio in Basel together with Chris Air. In 2015 he published his first solo album \\"1\\" (initially only in digital version). \\"1\\" was produced by Amadeus Paulussen and mixed by Chris Air at kubus media studio.

Early life Anthonius was born in the castle of Ten Walle in Beveren in 1576, son of Philip Triest, knight, lord of Auweghem, and Marie van Royen. He studied at the Augustinian college in Ghent and at Leuven University, graduating Licentiate of Laws. On 8 May 1596 he was appointed to a canonry in St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent, becoming archdeacon in 1599.A. C. De Schrevel, \\"Triest (Antoine)\\", in Biographie nationale de Belgique, vol. 25 (Brussels, 1932), 614‚Äì624. On 5 July 1610 he became dean of the chapter of St. Donatian's Cathedral, Bruges, in which capacity he was delegate of the First Estate in the States of Flanders. Episcopal career On 10 August 1616 Triest was named bishop of Bruges, and he was consecrated as such on 9 July 1617. From 25 November 1617 to 28 January 1618 he was absent from his diocese on a mission to reconcile the Duke of Lorraine and his brother, the Count of Vaudement. On 10 July 1620 he was named bishop of Ghent, in succession to Jacobus Boonen, who had become archbishop of Mechelen. Due to various delays he continued to act as bishop of Bruges until he could be replaced there, and was installed in his new see only on 7 April 1622. As bishop he supported charitable institutions such as the newly established mount of piety (that provided interest-free credit to the poor) and an orphanage for girls, re-organised Sunday schools, encouraged the foundation of confraternities and patronised the arts. In 1623 he acquired a new property to house the Major Seminary of Ghent (first founded 1569). His intelligent interest in the visual arts gained him the friendship of Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony Van Dyck and David Teniers the Younger. He commissioned his own tomb from Fran√ßois Duquesnoy, and it was completed in 1651. Papal interdict Triest fell into disgrace through his refusal to publish the 1643 papal condemnation of Cornelius Jansen's Augustinus. In 1651 he justified his continued resistance by issuing his episcopal order Noveritis, a document which was condemned by the Holy Office. He was summoned to Rome to answer before the Pope, but on 29 August 1652 the Council of Brabant issued an order under the jus de non evocando forbidding him from pleading his case before a foreign tribunal. On 19 December 1652 Innocent X placed Triest, and his colleague Jacobus Boonen, under interdict and suspended them from their episcopal functions. In Cum occasione the Pope formally declared five propositions derived from Augustinus as heretical. Triest submitted and on 23 September 1653 received absolution from the papal internuncio, Andrea Mangelli, and was reinstated in his functions. Triest died in Ghent on 28 May 1657. By his will he left a third of his wealth to the poor of the city.

The tomb is most likely royal and dates to the mid-13th Dynasty. Finds from nearby tombs indicate that S10 suffered extensive state-sanctioned stone and grave robbing during the Second Intermediate Period, only a few decades after its construction, as well as during the later Roman and Coptic periods. These finds also show that S10 was used for an actual burial and belonged to a king \\"Sobekhotep\\", now believed to be pharaoh Sobekhotep IV (fl. c. 1725 BC). According to the Egyptologist Josef W. Wegner who excavated S10, the tomb might originally have been capped by a pyramid, although Aidan Dodson states that it is still unclear whether S10 was a pyramid or a mastaba. Description Abydos, plan of tomb S10, as published in 1904 The tomb structure is part of a royal necropolis dating back to the late Middle Kingdom ‚Äì Second Intermediate Period, which is located close to the ancient town of Wah-Sut, next to the much bigger funerary complex of Senusret III of the 12th Dynasty, at the foot of the so-called Mountain of Anubis, a natural hill in the form of a pyramid. It was first excavated in 1901‚Äì02 by Ayrton, Weigall and Petrie, who found it heavily looted and disturbed. The complex consists of a rectangular brick walled structure, some in size, described by the first excavators as a mastaba, who however gave no evidence supporting this classification. At the north side there is an entrance to a system of underground and limestone paved corridors leading to the burial chamber that was found heavily destroyed. More recent excavations discovered fragments of a canopic jar, demonstrating that the tomb was once used. There is evidence that the tomb was already heavily looted in the Second Intermediate Period. A massive (60-ton) red quartzite sarcophagus quarried at El-Gabal el-Ahmar near the modern Cairo, most likely originally located in this tomb, was found in a later royal tomb in the same necropolis (CS6). Planks from the cedar coffin from tomb S10 were reused by king Senebkay for his own neighboring burial (tomb CS9). The coffin was inscribed on the outside with Coffin Texts spells 777-785. Only few parts of the texts survived, but coffins with these spells are typical for the late Middle Kingdom at Abydos. On the fragments there appears the name of the king Sobekhotep. Nothing was found of the superstructure, but it is possible that there was a pyramid on top. Several fragments of a funerary stele were also found on site, however the stele was most likely reused in the adjacent intrusive tomb of king Senebkay, and none of the fragments were found in context. On the fragments of the stela appears again the name Sobekhotep. Attribution Statue of Sobekhotep IV, for whom S10 might have been built. Since the discovery of the tomb and until 2015, it was unknown who was buried here. Excavations in 2003 and in 2014 made it very likely that the structure was once a royal tomb. At the latter date, during the excavation directed by Josef W. Wegner of the University of Pennsylvania, a fragment of a funerary tomb stela bearing a relief naming a king Sobek[hotep] was found inside the enclosure, on the eastern side of the complex, close to where a small funerary chapel might once have existed. While in early press reports, published just after the discovery, king Sobekhotep I was named as the possible owner of the tomb, further analyses now indicate that this might belong to Sobekhotep IV instead. Indeed, not only do the fragments of wooden sarcophagus uncovered indicate a late Middle Kingdom date for the construction of S10, but its size means that its owner would have had to reign for long enough to complete it. This only leaves Sobekhotep III, IV, and VI as possibilities, with Sobekhotep IV being the most likely as he enjoyed the longest reign of these three kings. In addition, Sobekhotep IV is the only one of these kings for whom it is known with certainty that he undertook other works in Abydos. As a corollary, the nearby and slightly larger tomb S9 most likely belongs to Sobekhotep IV's predecessor and brother, Neferhotep I.

Players take control of the newly elected Vice President of Planet Earth, who must save the Earth by recruiting citizens to fight for him.  Gameplay  Citizens of Earth has been described as \\"a giant spoof on EarthBound\\" in which \\"you must collect your constituents like Pok√©mon\\". In it, you take the role of the newly elected Vice President of Earth, who begins his first day in office facing protestors, a missing President, and a suspicious coffee shop. As the game progresses, characters are added to the party, each with a unique title and personality, like Hippie Guy and Programmer. Enemies are strewn about the overworld map, and should the Vice President get too close, a separate battle screen will open up. He doesn't do any fighting himself, but instead gives commands to his party of up to three characters.  Reception  Meghan Sullivan of IGN gave the game a 6.5/10, saying \\"It charmed me with its blend of old-school RPG and contemporary satire, but nearly lost my vote with its sluggish pacing, irritatingly high enemy encounter rate, and crashes\\".

According to the 1668 canon law a child was to be baptized within eight days after the birth. Ulrika Eleonora and Charles XI had their children baptized in different rounds, first straight after the birth, and then a bit later at the formal ceremony.  History  In 1864 it was determined that all baptisms should take place within six weeks from the birth, a tradition that was maintained by the Royal family until the baptism of Carl XVI Gustaf in 1946. He was baptized first eleven weeks after his birth. The royal children, crown princess Victoria, prince Carl Philip and princess Madeleine were also baptized between eleven and fifteen weeks after they were born. The baptism of royal children is about more than tradition. The order of succession states that all members of the royal family must \\"confess to the true evangelic faith\\", or the right to the throne is lost. Many royal baptisms have taken place in the Royal Chapel, with a few exceptions.  Appearance  Silver was long to equate with the colour white in royal ceremonies. White long had a deep symbolic meaning in Christian contexts, the colour stood for light, virginity and purity. Silver cloths were therefore often used for swaddling infants and to carry as a canopy over parts of the baptism party.  Charles XI's cradle  In 1655 the future Charles XI received a cradle as a christening gift from his mothers parents. It is exhibited at the Royal Armoury in Stockholm, and it is the only item that still is in use. The cradle is made out of sculptured, gold plated and painted wood. The last time it was used was at Princess Estelle's baptism on May 22, 2012. A special parade cradle for princesses had been used since 1830, but when Estelle was born it was as an heir to the throne, so for her baptism Charles XI's cradle was taken out of the Royal Armoury.

The Governor of Bartƒ±n (Turkish: Bartƒ±n Valiliƒüi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Bartƒ±n. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Bartƒ±n is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Bartƒ±n. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Bartƒ±n provincial police force and the Bartƒ±n Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Bartƒ±n is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Bartƒ±n is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Bartƒ±n. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Bartƒ±n, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Bartƒ±n Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Bartƒ±n has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

From 1904 the publishers began arranging annual study weeks (semaines sociales) where Social Catholics could meet and exchange ideas. The parent organization continues to promote training and education about social cooperation, and a related limited company publishes books. Early years The Chronique des Comit√©s du Sud-Est (\\"Chronicle of the Southeast Committees\\") was founded in 1892 by Marius Gonin and Victor Berne. Gonin was a silk worker, celibate and mystic. At first the journal was just a newsletter for the distributors of La Croix, but it soon became the main organ of the Social Catholics in Lyon. It described itself as an \\"organ of social animation.\\" In the first years it promoted church teachings on social action as defined in the encyclical Rerum novarum. The Chronique gave the views of a group of lay Catholics that accepted Christian-democratic principles of social reform, and quickly attracted opposition from conservatives. 1900‚Äì1945 The journal was formally registered in July 1901. The readers were typically clerks, skilled workers and young clergymen. Given the choice of rebuilding the state in a Christian model, reforming society through Christian social, political and professional institutions, or bringing a Christian spirit to a secular society, the journal alternated between the latter two. This reflected the divergent views of its leaders. Berne and Gonin leaned towards the second view, and Critinon, Vialatoux and Hughes towards the third. From 1904 the Chronique sponsored study weeks (semaines sociales) each year that were attended by leading French social catholic activists. Marius Gonin founded the semaines sociales aided by Ad√©odat Boissard and Henri Lorin. For the next five years these \\"social weeks\\" were the main place for exchange of progressive social ideas within the church. Attendees discussed questions such as socialism, class struggle, strikes, factory abuses and liberation of the working classes. Other issues included Labor Contracts (1909, Bordeaux), Economic Role of the State (1922, Strasbourg), Women in Society (1927, Nancy) and The Disorder in the International Economy and Christian Thought (1932, Lille). The Chronique des Comit√©s du Sud-Est became the publishing arm of the Semaine sociale, and the base for its secretariat. It published the Actes des Semaines sociales de France that recorded the proceedings of the annual meetings. The journal changed its name to La Chronique du Sud-Est. Between April 1908 and March 1909 the Chronique du Sud-Est published three articles by Joseph Vialatoux that criticized the right-wing Action Fran√ßaise. The journal became the Chronique sociale in 1909. Victor Carlhian joined the journal before World War I, contributed articles and became a member of the management committee. From 1909 the journal appeared monthly, and would continue to do so during the remainder of the French Third Republic and throughout the French Fourth Republic (1946‚Äì58). A separate but related limited liability company was created in 1920 to undertake publishing. Between 1921 and 1930 twelve regional secretariats were created, federated into a national union. The Chronique sociale de France remained socially progressive. Despite this, in 1932 it published a study of the ideas of the nationalist Catholic Charles Maurras that compared him to Aristotle. Marius Gonin died in 1937 and was succeeded as secretary-general of the Semaines sociales by Joseph Folliet. Folliet directed the Chronique until 1964, and remained involved until his death in 1972. Before World War II (1939-45) the Chronique opposed Franco and the Nazis, often going against public opinion. During the war Folliet was mobilized and taken prisoner. He returned to Lyon in 1942 and devoted himself to the Chronique. Post-War In 1945 the Chronique sociale de France published a special issue Autour du Marxism (About Marxism). The authors tried to remain objective. They discussed Marxist dialectics, Marxism as an expression of the proletariat philosophy and the relationship of Marxism to religion. The journal published the testimony of Pierre Tiberghien in 1952 with a preface that called it a description of the way a Frenchman thought of the activity French Social Catholics, which might not be applicable elsewhere. During the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62) Joseph Folliet and Claude Bernardin established the Lyons Committee for the respect of human rights. The Chronique denounced military and civil abuses in Algeria. Books published during the 1960s included Introduction to family issues (1960), Social security and Victory over Death (1962), Control or Regulation of Birth (1963), Adam and Eve, humanity and sexuality (1966). In the 1960s the journal was concerned with topics such as the future organization of companies and industries, changes in the nature of labor unions, growing specialization of labor and the expanding middle classes. The tone was more that of social engineers than Christians. A board of directors was set up in 1967 to oversee the education and research activities. The Chronique Sociale today has the objectives of raising awareness of social change and encourage cooperation and respect for individuals. It supports the related activities of research, discussion, training and publishing. The books are organized within five main collections: understanding people, understanding society, education and training, communicating and ways of thinking.

A number of hiking trails are also in its vicinity. Geography The main outflow of Lake Rose is an unnamed tributary of Kitchen Creek. One of its main inflows is the spillway from Lake Jean. The lake has an elevation of above sea level. Lake Rose is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Red Rock. It has an area of . Lake Rose is mostly dry, but there is a small pool of water in it. It more closely resembles a swamp than it does a lake. In 1990, Northeastern Geology stated that Lake Rose \\"appears on the map but not in reality\\". Lake Rose was undeveloped in the early 1960s. History and recreation Lake Rose was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1185462. Lake Rose was built by Jesse Dodson, a squatter who made bedsteads out of cherry trees, and built the lake as a log splash pond. In 1905, Colonel R. Bruce Ricketts reinforced the Lake Rose dam. However, due to the dam's poor construction, the lake could not be used for hydroelectric power. In the middle of the 20th century, the state of Pennsylvania condemned the dam and drained the lake. In 1950, some studies were being done by the Division of Dams on dams or dam repairs at Lake Rose. The Ganoga Glen Trail in Ricketts Glen State Park passes near Lake Rose, as does the Highland Trail. Biology A Menziesia pilosa shrub was once observed in the vicinity of Lake Rose. Highbrush blueberry also occurs in the vicinity of the lake. Certain types of wildlife can occur in the vicinity of Lake Rose, depending on the time of year. Birds in this area include white-throated sparrows, mallard ducks, and evening grosbeaks. Insect species include monarch butterflies, sulfur butterflies, and various species of dragonfly. The lake was stocked with fish as late as 1980.

The Governor of Batman (Turkish: Batman Valiliƒüi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Batman. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Batman is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Batman. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Batman provincial police force and the Batman Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Batman is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Batman is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Batman. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Batman, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Batman Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Batman has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order.

Background With its simple musical structure and infectious sing-a-long chorus, \\"Calling You\\" remains one of Williams' most affecting gospel compositions. It was recorded at the singer's first ever recording session on December 11, 1946 for Sterling Records with Fred Rose producing. Williams was backed on the session by the Willis Brothers, who also went by the name of the Oklahoma Wranglers: James \\"Guy\\" Willis (guitar), Vic Wallis (accordion), Charles \\"Skeeter\\" Willis (fiddle), and Charles \\"Indian\\" Wright (bass). In the 2004 book Hank Williams: The Biography, Vic Willis recalls to Colin Escott, \\"Hank was a quiet guy and kinda negative. But he had a hell of a dry sense of humor. Someone asked Hank if he wanted a beer with his meal, and he shook his head. 'You don't know ol' Hank. Hank just don't have one beer.'\\" The uneasy dichotomy between Williams' faith and his often reckless lifestyle would only make him a more compelling figure in years to come, especially in light of the passion he unfailingly displayed when singing spiritual music.

She was captured in May 2015 by US Delta Force soldiers on the mission where they killed her husband, a suspected leader of the Islamic State. During the raid Delta Force soldiers were also reported to have rescued a young Yazidi woman the couple had been keeping as a slave. National Security Council spokesperson Bernadette Meehan stated, \\"We suspect that Umm Sayyaf is a member of ISIL, played an important role in ISIL's terrorist activities, and may have been complicit in the enslavement of the young woman rescued last night.\\" Umm Sayyaf is believed to be an Iraqi citizen. Initial reports said that she was in US custody in Iraq. On August 6, 2015 Umm Sayyaf was turned over to the Kurdish regional authorities in Erbil. James Gordon Meek, of ABC News noted some American prosecutors wanted to try to prosecute her in the US justice system. He characterized the Kurdish justice system as being \\"known for lightning-swift justice.\\" According to John Knefel, reporting for Al Jazeera, legal critics have challenged the Barack Obama administration for a lack of transparency over the justification for holding Umm Sayyaf in extrajudicial detention. He said, \\"The administration's secrecy surrounding the conditions of her imprisonment have led some lawyers and legal analysis to raise questions about what rights and protections she's being afforded, and what policy guidelines will govern treatment of new detainees in what some now refer to as the Forever War.\\" The family of American hostage Kayla Mueller reported that they had been told that, during her captivity, she was imprisoned by Abu Sayyaf and Umm Sayyaf and sexually abused by Abu Sayyaf before she was taken as a wife and sexually abused by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Yazidi girls, who had been held as sex slaves by Abu Sayyaf, and who later escaped, were the first to report that Mueller was also sexually abused before her death. Interrogation of various individuals by intelligence officials seemed to indicate that al-Baghdadi had been Mueller's primary abuser. On February 8, 2016, Sayyaf was charged by American prosecutors in Virginia with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization that resulted in a person's death. The federal charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\\"Kayla Mueller's death results in terrorist charges for ISIS leader's wife\\", by Reuters, via CBC.ca In May 2019, it was reported that she had been cooperating with the CIA and Kurdish intelligence in the hunt for al- Baghdadi.

Background Prior to the beginning of World War I, Liberia was largely impoverished and unstable, and dependent on Germany for around 75% of its foreign trade. The start of the war caused a drop in German trade, with resulting severe effects on the Liberian economy. Although the start of the war globally prevented Liberia from acquiring weapons, the American government consented to sell the Liberians arms at half-price, enabling the Liberian Frontier Force to keep down local insurrections. Participation Following the outbreak of war, the German trade collapsed. However a German telegraph station was maintained until Liberia declared war on Germany on 4 August 1917. At that point, the station's garrison was deported. Liberia had minimal active involvement in the war itself. Monrovia suffered one shelling by a German submarine in June 1918 ‚Äì targeting their former telegraph station ‚Äì and a small number of Liberian troops served in France, though they did not see combat. In April 1918 the Liberian government seized German assets in the country, resulting in yet further economic disruption, particularly as German companies had displaced Liberian businesses in the local economy; this was further exacerbated by a German submarine blockade affecting Liberian ship traffic. As an Allied nation, Liberia received Liberty Loans from the United States, though this financial support decreased greatly after the end of the war. A loan to \\"bolster and replace\\" profits lost as a result of Liberia's involvement was proposed by President Woodrow Wilson, but blocked by the United States Senate.

For a time he and Claude Debussy were both drawn into the orbit of another Rose + Croix defector, Jules Bois, the occultist writer and publisher of the esoteric journal Le coeur. Bois' 1895 book Le satanisme et la magie (Satanism and Magic) and other \\"blasphemous\\" writings pegged him as a Satanist, but he delved into a wide range of ancient and modern religions and superstitions, as well as psychology. While Debussy declined an offer to write incidental music for Bois' play Les Noces de Sathan (1892), the little-known Satie found the association (and the publicity it brought) more congenial. It was in the October 1893 issue of Le coeur that Satie announced the founding of his one-man sect the Metropolitan Church of Art of Jesus the Conductor, and Bois continued to publish items by and about the composer until his journal folded in June 1895. La Porte h√©ro√Øque du ciel would be their only creative collaboration. Jules Bois The plot of Bois' one-act \\"esoteric drama\\" involves a poet who is sent on a mission by Christ to forcibly dethrone the Virgin Mary and replace her with the ancient Egyptian goddess Isis.

Description and history The Hobbs House is located on the south side of Wells Street (Maine State Route 9), just east of its junction with Elm Street (Maine State Route 4) and west of the Great Works River in North Berwick's village center. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and a fieldstone foundation. The main entrance is sheltered by a small hip-roofed portico that is a later addition. The building has no significant styling: its upper windows butting against the eave in a typical Georgian fashion, and it has simple narrow corner boards and window trim. A single-story ell extends to the rear of the main block. The house was built in 1763 for Thomas Hobbs Jr., a veteran of the French and Indian War. It became known locally as The Hostelry, because Hobbs provided food and lodging to travelers. Hobbs and his descendants were also active in local civic affairs, serving in the state legislature, and in the 1819 constitutional convention convened to draft Maine's constitution in advance of statehood.

Sphaerosyllis goorabantennata is distinct by its small size, small and unevenly distributed papillae, as well as by its particularly long antennae and tentacular cirri. Sphaerosyllis minima and S. minima magnapapillata are also small, but their antennae and tentacular cirri are significantly shorter, like its cogenerate species. The species' name is derived from the Aboriginal word gooraba, meaning \\"big\\", alluding to its long antennae. Description The species' body is small, with a total length of and width of , including 26 chaetigers. It possesses few small papillae, somewhat longer on chaetiger 2. Its prostomium is rectangular and wide, showing 4 small eyes in a trapezoidal arrangement. Its antennae are long, longer than the combined length of its prostomium and palps; they have bulbous bases and slender filiform tips. The palps are blunt, longer than its prostomium, fused along their length, possessing a dorsal furrow and few papillae. Its peristomium measures the same as its succeeding segments. Its tentacular cirri are long, however shorter than the antennae; the dorsal cirri are similar to its cogenerates', with bulbous bases and thin tips, being shorter than the tentacular cirri, with slender tips. Its anterior parapodia have 5-6 compound chaetae each, with unidentate blades provided with short spines exhibiting dorsoventral gradation. Posterior parapodia, on the other hand, possess 4 compound chaetae each, with unidentate blades provided with short spines as well. The dorsal simple chaetae from the proventricular segments are unidentate and show marginal spines. Its ventral simple chaetae on the posterior parapodia are sigmoid, smooth and unidentate. Its acicula is bent to a right angle. Sphaerosyllis goorabantennata does not show parapodial glands. The pharynx spans approximately 3 segments and is relatively slender. Its proventricle spans through 1 or 2 segments, with 15 muscle cell rows. Its pygidium is small, with a few small papillae and 2 anal cirri, which are similar to its dorsal cirri but longer. Distribution S. goorabantennata was found in Western Australia, at a depth of between in dead corals. Its distribution is thought to include the whole of WA.

Arabian (December 12, 1934 ‚Äì March 28, 2018) was an American lawyer who served as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of California from February 3, 1990, to February 28, 1996. Early life and education Armand was born in New York City to John and Aghavnie (n√©e Yalian) Arabian, who had immigrated from Armenia following the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Arabian received a B.A. in Psychology from Boston University in 1956. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army from 1956 to 1958. After his discharge, he obtained a J.D. from Boston University School of Law in 1961, and a LL.M. from the University of Southern California Law Center in 1970. Legal and judicial career Before his appointment to the court, Arabian was a Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney, 1962-1963, and an attorney in private practice in Van Nuys, California, 1963-1972. In 1972, Arabian was appointed by Governor Ronald Reagan as a Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge, where he served one year. Arabian was then elevated by Governor Reagan to the Los Angeles County Superior Court, where he presided from 1973 to 1983. In 1979, Arabian's initial appointment to the Court of Appeals was the subject of controversy: \\"When California Governor Jerry Brown left the state to campaign for the presidency in 1979, Lieutenant Governor Mike Curb appointed Armand Arabian to the court of appeal, knowing well that Brown intended to appoint someone else. When Brown returned, he withdrew Arabian's appointment and made his own. The ensuing dispute made it to the state supreme court, which ruled both the appointment and the withdrawal legal.\\" Four years later, Governor George Deukmejian officially appointed Arabian an Associate Justice of the California Court of Appeal, Second District, where he served from 1983 to 1990. In 1990, Deukmejian appointed Arabian the 105th justice to the California Supreme Court, where he served until his retirement in 1996. As a jurist, Arabian was known as a law-and-order conservative. On the court, he was leader in the reform of California rape laws. In a 1973 criminal trial, Arabian declined to instruct the jury to treat skeptically the victim's testimony‚Äîto the effect that a rape charge \\"is easily made and, once made, difficult to defend against\\"‚Äîan instruction the state Supreme Court had ruled was mandatory. In 1994, Arabian wrote the unanimous opinion in People v. Iniguez (1994),People v. Iniguez, 7 Cal.4th 847 (1994) which held that a sexual assault without struggle can be deemed rape, instead of the lesser crime of sexual battery. Since stepping down from the bench, Arabian has worked as a mediator and arbitrator. He has also served on the Board of Visitors at Pepperdine University School of Law. Honors and awards Arabian has received numerous honors and awards. In 1973, the Armenian Professional Society conferred on him its annual Achievement Award. In 1981, Arabian received Boston University School of Law's Silver Shingle Award for Distinguished Service to the Legal Profession, and in 1990, he was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award from Boston University. In 2011, Arabian was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award of the San Fernando Valley Bar Association's Community Legal Foundation. Arabian was given honorary Doctor of Law degrees by several law schools, including: Southwestern School Law, 1990; Pepperdine University, 1990; University of West Los Angeles, 1994; Thomas Jefferson School of Law, 1997; and American College Law, 2001.

He was educated in the public schools of Shasta County, and received an A.B. from Napa College, later affiliated with the College of the Pacific, in 1879, and an LL.B. from the Hastings College of the Law in 1882. Shurtleff commenced the practice of the law in San Francisco, first with Morris M. Estee, a distinguished lawyer who later was appointed United States District Judge for the Territory of Hawaii, and then in 1883 or 1884 with Judge Waldo M. York, the father of Judge John M. York, and with distinguished attorney John M. Whitworth. Shurtleff was active in Republican Party politics, serving in June 1890 on the party's 41st Assembly district club. In November 1890, Shurtleff was appointed as Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of California. After resigning in October 1893 from the U.S. Attorney's Office, Shurtleff returned to private practice. Of his former law partners, Waldo moved to New York, and Whitworth died, leaving Shurtleff to continue his practice with Robert B. Gaylord until 1909, and then with Joseph G. DeForest. On July 1, 1921, Shurtleff was appointed by Governor William Stephens to a seat of the Supreme Court of California vacated by the resignation of Associate Justice Warren Olney Jr. When first offered appointment to the state supreme court, Shurtleff, who was noted for his loyalty to his employees, initially declined because it would cause him to abandon his secretary, who had served him faithfully for many years. The Chief Justice prevailed on Shurtleff by permitting him to bring his secretary to work at the court. In November 1922, he ran for the remainder of Olney's unexpired term, but lost the election. Bar and civic activities Over the course of his career, Shurtleff was active in several bar and civic boards. In the bar, he was a member along with M. C.

Early life Born at Redford, Wayne County, Michigan to Benjamin F. Fox, a farmer of English descent,Leigh Hadley Irvine, A History of the New California: Its Resources and People, Vol. II (1905), p. 668-70. Fox moved to Ann Arbor at the age of fifteen to earn his own living, and to attend the newly opened Ann Arbor University.In Memoriam: Charles Newton Fox, Cal. Reports Vol. 143 (1904). Due to a bout of illness, and unable to afford tuition, he took a job at a printing office, and soon became an editor. He was elected city recorder of Ann Arbor, and acted as mayor of the city a portion of the term. He read law in the office of Kingsley & Morgan, and was admitted to the bar by the Supreme Court of Michigan in 1856. Legal career In August 1857, he moved to San Mateo County, California, was admitted to the California bar in July 1858, and shortly thereafter was appointed to fill a vacancy in the office of the district attorney. He won successive elections to the office for five years, when he declined further election. He was retained by the Spring Valley Water Company to attend to their business in San Mateo County, and succeeded in securing the legal rights and property without involvement in any lawsuits over a ten year period. He then became a local attorney for the newly organized San Francisco and San Jose Railroad Company, securing their right of way through San Mateo County, and thereafter became president and attorney of the Western Pacific Railroad Company. He then moved from Redwood City to San Francisco and was appointed general attorney of the Spring Valley Water Company, and continued to act as one of its legal advisers for nearly forty years. Fox declined several overtures to accept judicial and other positions, but ran for a seat as a Republican in the first session of the legislature held under the 1879 Constitution of California. He was made chairman of the judiciary committee, and used his position to keep bad laws out of the statutes, reportedly causing the postponement of a thousand bills. Very few bills that he opposed ultimately passed, and every one that was passed against his opposition on the ground that it conflicted with the constitution, was eventually pronounced unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. In September 1880, he resigned from the Assembly to serve as an elector for presidential candidate James A. Garfield at the Republican national convention. Fox remained active in civic activities in Oakland. In June 1877, he helped organize a free reading room in the city. In February 1878, he was a founder of the Oakland Law Library. In March 1879, he was elected to the Oakland Board of Education, and served as its president. In 1881, Fox was selected as general counsel for the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company. In June 1889, Governor Robert Waterman appointed Fox as an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court, following the resignation of Justice Jackson Temple. Fox served on the court to the end of the next year. He authored one of the most noted opinions of the term in Jessup's Case,In re Jessup, 81 Cal. 408, 423, 6 L. R. A. 594, 21 Pac. 976. establishing a rule by which an illegitimate child can become legitimized. After leaving the court, he was a member of the law firm of Campbell, Fox & Campbell, then with the firm of Fox, Kellogg & King. This firm became Fox, Kellogg & Gray until 1895, when it became the firm of Fox & Gray. He was working up until the day of his death, leaving his office on April 26, 1903, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and dying before morning had dawned. Clubs Fox became a member of the Odd Fellows at the age of 21, and was active and influential in that organization throughout his life, serving as grand master for the state of California in 1867-68, grand patriarch in 1868-69, and representative to the grand lodge of the United States in 1869-70. He was the first president of the Odd Fellows' home founded under his administration, acting in that capacity from 1893 to 1898. In October 1869, he was elected an officer of the Sons and Daughters of Temperance. Personal life Fox had married Celestia M. Fox in Michigan, but she died in Redwood City, California, on January 29, 1859. On January 1, 1860, he remarried to Lucy Taylor in San Mateo, California. In June 1864, after her death, he remarried to Mary Schwartz Rice, a native of France, who came to California in 1857 and lost her first husband soon after her arrival. He had eight children, but only two survived him: Mrs. Mary Gray and Miss Ida Frances Fox. His two brothers, Benjamin F. and George W. Fox, an attorney, and two sisters also lived in California.

Early life and education Curtis was born on July 18, 1865, in San Bernardino, California, to William Jesse Curtis and Frances Sophia Cowles. They had arrived in 1864 after traveling on the Oregon Trail from Iowa as members of the Pella Company wagon train that included the family of Wyatt Earp. Curtis' family has a long association with the law. Curtis' father was a teacher and lawyer who helped found the San Bernardino Bar Association. Curtis' grandfather, I. C. Curtis, was a lawyer and a member of the Iowa Legislature. Curtis' uncle, William S. Holman, was a Democratic Congressman from Indiana, and Curtis' great-grandfather on his mother's side, Jesse Lynch Holman, sat on the first Indiana Supreme Court and was later a United States District Court judge. Curtis' son, Jesse William Curtis Jr., became a federal court judge, as well. In 1887, Curtis graduated with a Ph.B. in the first class that went completely through the University of Southern California (he was eventually their oldest living alumnus). In 1891, he received a LL.B. from the University of Michigan Law School. He then began private practice in San Bernardino with his father at Curtis, Oster & Curtis, and its progeny, where he remained for 23 years, except for a stint from 1899 to 1903 serving as District Attorney of San Bernardino County. Judicial career In 1915, Curtis was named Judge of the Superior Court of San Bernardino County. On March 26, 1923, Governor Friend W.

Among Curtis' notable cases were a pair of contempt citations for commenting on judicial proceedings: the first against longshoremen union leader Harry Bridges, and the second against the Los Angeles Times. In 1939, the California Supreme Court, in a 5-1 opinion in Bridges v. Superior Court of Los Angeles, affirmed the judgment of contempt.Bridges v. Superior Court of Los Angeles, 94 P.2d 983 (Cal. 1939). In an opinion by Curtis, the court rejected Bridges' contention that he had a First Amendment right to criticize the court. On January 31, 1940, in a 5-2 decision by Curtis, the court also upheld the contempt ruling against the Times. Upon appeal, in a 5-4 opinion by Justice Hugo Black, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed in Bridges v. California. After retiring from the Supreme Court in 1945, Curtis returned to private practice with his son in San Bernardino. Awards and legacy In 1934, Curtis was awarded the Asa Call alumnus achievement trophy by the University of Southern California. He was bestowed honorary law degrees in 1926 by the University of Southern California, in 1928 by Southwestern University, and by the University of Redlands, where his three children had studied and he was a trustee from 1909.

The follow-up single, which was released while \\"Move It on Over\\" was still climbing the charts, was \\"On the Banks of the Old Ponchartrain,\\" with \\"Fly Trouble\\" as the B-side. The single was a disappointment, failing to chart, and moved away from what was arguably Williams' biggest strength: his songwriting. The words to the A-side were written by a woman named Ramona Vincent, who sent the poem to Hank, while \\"Fly Trouble\\" was written by Rose and the blackface comedy team of Bunny Biggs and Honey Wilds, better known as Jamup and Honey. Although Williams would go on to record several humorous songs which showcased his dry sense of humor, \\"Fly Trouble\\" is an anomaly in his canon, as country music historian Colin Escott observes: \\"It seemed to signal Rose's intention of easing Hank uptown. From the hokey lyrics to Sammy Pruett's jazzy guitar breaks, the entire production was precisely what Hank's music was not about, and it was precisely what white sandyland farmers who had just moved to town did not what to hear.\\" The song was recorded at Castle Studio in Nashville on August 4, 1947 with Rose producing. Williams was backed by Tommy Jackson (fiddle), Hermon Herron (steel guitar), Sammy Pruett (lead guitar), Slim Thomas (rhythm guitar), and Lum York (bass).

P11-4 (INCI name Oligopeptide 104) consists of the natural occurring amino acids Glutamine, Glutamic acid, Phenylalanine, Tryptophan and Arginine. The resulting higher molecular structure has a high affinity to tooth mineral. P11-4 has been developed and patented by The University of Leeds (UK). The swiss company credentis has licensed the peptide technology and markets it under the trade names including CUROLOX, REGENAMEL, and EMOFLUOR. They offer three products with this technology. As of June 2016 in Switzerland products are available with new Brand names from Dr. Wild & Co AG. Mechanism of action P11-4 is an Œ±-peptide that self-assembles into Œ≤-sheet amyloids with a hydrogel appearance at low pH. It builds a 3-D bio-matrix with binding sites for calcium ions serving as nucleation point for hydroxyapatite (tooth mineral) formation. The high affinity to tooth mineral is based on matching distances of Ca-ion binding sites on P11-4 and Ca spacing in the crystal lattice of hydroxyapatite. The matrix formation is pH controlled and thus allows control matrix activity and place of formation. P11-4 in dental applications Self assembling properties of P11-4 are used to regenerate early caries lesions. By application of P11-4 on the tooth surface, the peptide diffuse through the intact hypomineralized plate into the early caries lesion body and start, due to the low pH in such a lesion, to self-assemble generating a peptide scaffold mimicking the enamel matrix. Around the newly formed matrix de-novo enamel-crystals are formed from calcium phosphate present in saliva. Through the remineralization caries activity is significantly reduced in comparison with a fluoride treatment alone. In aqueous oral care gels the peptide is present as matrix. It binds directly as matrix to the tooth mineral and forms a stable layer on the teeth. This layer does protect the teeth from acid attacks. It also occludes open dentin tubules and thus reduces the dental sensitivity. Uses * Treatment of initial caries lesions * Regenerating enamel * Dentin hypersensitivity * Acid protection Availability Availability of products containing P11-4 vary by country, with some products available only to dentists, and others available to the retail public.

It is part of the Uniting Church in Australia Synod of Victoria and Tasmania's Centre for Theology & Ministry.  Overview and history  Pilgrim Theological College reflects the multi- denominational background of the Uniting Church and is a provider of ecumenical theological studies, offering undergraduate, post-graduate and audit courses that are focused on theology, ministry, pastoral care, philosophy and research methodology. Additionally, the college focuses on preparing students seeking ordained ministry in the Uniting Church or another denomination as a lay preacher or pastor, and providing higher education and continuing professional development for ordained ministers. Field education has, for some time, been a focus of the College's formation program. Pilgrim Theological College was opened in 2015. It was previously known as the Uniting Church Theological College, which formed part of the United Faculty of Theology - a co-operative venture of the Anglican, Jesuit and Uniting theological colleges that closed in 2014. Until its closure, the Uniting Church Theological College was a member school of the Melbourne College of Divinity that had been in operation since 1910, becoming the University of Divinity in 2011. The change to university status followed the decision by the Melbourne College of Divinity to apply to the Victorian Regulation and Qualifications Authority to operate as an \\"Australian University of Specialisation\\". In 2012 the college began operating as a university. Uniting Church Theological College alumni are considered alumni of Pilgrim Theological College. Location Pilgrim Theological College operates from the Centre for Theology & Ministry building in the grounds of Ormond College in Parkville, Melbourne. The building was designed by Williams Boag Architects and won the Australian Institute of Architects Award for Heritage Architecture (Vic) in 2008. The building also houses the Dalton McCaughey Library - home to the combined collections of the Jesuit Theological College and Ormond Theological Hall as well as additional material from Queen's College and the theological hall of the Victorian Congregational Church following the inception of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977.

Cited in Britton 1978, p. 14. Established in 1786, the Marines saw active service in New South Wales from 1788 to 1792 and was instrumental in establishing the colony's rule of law. Study of the complete New South Wales Marine complement indicates they were chosen from Plymouth and Portsmouth Divisions with only one exception. Beginning with guards arriving with the 2nd and 3rd fleets but officially with the arrival of on 22 September 1791 the New South Wales Marines were relieved by a newly formed British Army regiment of foot, the New South Wales Corps. On 18 December 1791 left Port Jackson taking home the larger part of the still serving New South Wales Marines. Those leaving included Maj Robert Ross, Watkin Tench, William Dawes, and Ralph Clark, and 90 non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and privates. Of the departure, Tench said, \\"we hailed it with rapture and exhilaration\\". There remained in New South Wales a company of active Marines serving under Captain George Johnston, consisting of three officers, eight NCOs, two drummers and 50 privates. Also remaining in the colony were some 90 discharged Marines, many of whom became settlers. The official departure of the last serving Marines from the colony of New South Wales was in December 1792 when Governor Phillip departed aboard Atlantic Transport accompanied by the remaining three Marine lieutenants and some 20 NCOs and privates who received their final discharges at the Marine headquarters in Portsmouth in June 1793, marking the official disbandment of the Corps. Officers were allowed to transfer into other divisions to continue their careers. Establishment The Corps was established on 31 August 1786 with assent from King George III for a force of 160 enlisted marines and accompanying officers to attend the settlement of New South Wales \\"... for the purpose of enforcing subordination and obedience in the settlement [at Botany Bay], as well as for defence of that settlement against the incursions of the natives.\\"Correspondence, The Lords of the Admiralty to His Majesty the King, 21 November 1786. Cited in Bladen (ed.) 1978, pp. 372‚Äì373 Volunteers for the NSW Marine Corps were required to have had a satisfactory prior record of service in the British Marines, to be at least tall and under forty years of age.Moore 1989, pp. 22‚Äì23 Recruits were offered a two-guinea incentive payment if they volunteered for the Corps. A further inducement was that although enlistment as a British Marine was traditionally for life, members of the New South Wales Marine Corps could seek an honourable discharge after three years of colonial service.Moore 1989, p.8 With an eye to the likelihood of delays in setting out, the three-year term would commence on arrival of the Fleet in New South Wales rather than the dates of enlistment in England. Marines who chose this option had no automatic right of return to military service after discharge, but in practice few were refused re-entry when their service expired. Rates of pay were in accordance with those of the British Marines, including routine provision of a subsistence allowance equivalent to two- thirds of daily pay. British Marines received the allowance when in the field (i.e., not serving on board a vessel); the NSW Marines received the allowance for the duration of their three-year enlistment, relieving the Admiralty or the government of the colony of the responsibility of providing messing facilities. New South Wales Marine Corps uniforms consisted of a red long- tailed doublet, white trousers, black headdress, and shoes and gaiters. Officers were authorised to carry swords and sidearms; other ranks were issued Brown Bess muskets. Active service In May 1787 four companies of marines, consisting of 160 Privates with 52 officers and NCO's under Major Robert Ross, accompanied the First Fleet to Botany Bay. In addition there were 34 officers and men serving in Ship's Complement of Marines aboard Sirius and Supply, bringing the total to 246 departed EnglandReturn of the four Companies of Marines detached to serve in the Settlement in NSW - 20 May 1787 (TNA CO201/2, p158-9) The Board of Ordnance had provided one thousand carbines and ten thousand musket flints for Marine use in New South Wales,Moore 1989, p. 27 but due to an oversight in provisioning, the Fleet left Portsmouth without any substantial supply of ammunition.Moore 1989, p. 41 The error was kept a secret from the convicts in order to avoid an uprising, and was addressed via resupply when the fleet made port in Rio de Janeiro midway through the voyage. Security was strictly maintained during the voyage. Bulkheads filled with nails were constructed across each deck to separate the convict quarters from those of the Marines and ship's crew. Marines were routinely stationed at loopholes in these bulkheads in order to fire upon the convicts if necessary. Marines were located behind barricades constructed across the main deck and at each of the hatches leading below. A further Marine detachment was also permanently stationed on the quarterdeck.Mundle 2014, pp. 57‚Äì58 A marine caught in the convict women's tent was drummed out of the Corps on 9 February 1788.

Bogus≈Çaw Szwacz (born 27 March 1912 in Le≈ºajsk, died 24 February 2009 in Warsaw) was a Polish-born artist, painter, sculptor, professor and lecturer at Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts.  Life and education  Hailed as one of the most significant Polish artists of the post-war period, Boguslaw Szwacz first developed his artistic talents in 1924 as a student at the renowned Krzemieniec Lyceum. In addition to studying under W≈Çadys≈Çaw Galimski and Stanis≈Çaw Sheybal, Szwacz pursued a degree at the Krak√≥w Academy of Fine Arts in 1930. Here, he studied in the studios of Ignacy Pie≈Ñkowski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jarocki, Karol Frycz, Jan Hoplinski, Teodor Axentowicz and Xawery Dunikowski, among others. Szwacz graduated with honours in 1937, and was awarded the right to unlimited use of the artistic studios as a grant of the rector. Amidst his studies, Szwacz underwent training at the Infantry Reserve Officer Cadet School in Zambr√≥w. During the Second World War, as a staff officer and commander of an anti-tank battery, he took part in battles around Krak√≥w and his hometown, Lvov (Battle of Lw√≥w). After the Polish surrender, Szwacz escaped to Kowel and made his way back to Krak√≥w. In post-war Poland, Szwacz officially began his artistic career. For a short time, he lived in Tyniec, where he painted a cycle of watercolour landscapes. He then joined the Association of Polish Artists and Designers in Krak√≥w, and together with a group including Tadeusz Kantor and Jerzy Nowosielski, he founded ‚ÄòThe Young Artists.' The group organized a celebrated exhibition of modern painting ‚Äì The Young Artists Group Exhibition in the rooms of the Palace of Art in Krak√≥w in October 1946. The same year, Szwacz became a lecturer at his alma mater. In 1947, Szwacz went to France for a year on a scholarship from the Ministry of Culture and Art. During his time in Paris, he met and befriended several avant-garde artists including Fernand L√©ger, Edouard Pignon, Hans Hartung, Jean Bazaine, Maurice Est√®ve and No√´l Arnaude, who was the editorial secretary of a journal published by the influential artists‚Äô group, \\"Le Surr√©alisme R√©volutionnaire\\" (Revue bimestrielle publi√© par le Bureau International du Surr√©alisme ‚Äì R√©volutionnaire). Impressed with Szwacz, Arnaud enlisted him as a co-founder and correspondent of the magazine. Along with another Parisian artists group, he took part in an exhibition in the Ren√© Breteau gallery and in the III \\"Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles\\" in 1948. When he returned to Poland, Szwacz settled down in Warsaw and began lecturing at PWSSP, which was transformed in 1950 into the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. Soon after joining the Young Artists and Scientists Club in Warsaw, his social-realist paintings gained popularity; he participated in four impressive Modern Art Exhibitions in the city from 1948 to 1959. Szwacz retired from his position as professor in 1982, devoting himself to poetry and perfecting his trademark idea of art ‚Äì Ars Horme. A lover of classical music, astronomy and physics, he played the violin and composed simple fiddle pieces. Mozart Ars ‚Äì Hormegryf, 1976, oil and tempera on canvas, 177x132 cm In 2005, he was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. He had previously been decorated with the Gold Cross of Merit and the Medal of the 10th Anniversary of People's Poland.  Work  Although traditionally trained in realism, Szwacz began to experiment with cubism and in his later years, informel. After 1955, he abandoned figurative art and switched to abstractionism, at which time he developed his trademark concept ‚Äî Ars-Horme, or \\"The Art of Moving the Imagination\\". Szwacz presented the tenets of Ars-Horme in the form of an artistic manifesto in 1977 at an open-air exhibition in Osieki. His characteristic compositions, created in the Ars-Horme style are called ars-hormegryphs and ars-hormegrams. They include watercolours, prints, reliefs, paintings, gouaches. In the 1960s, Szwacz exhibited in the Krzywe Ko≈Ço Gallery in Warsaw and took part in the First Biennale of Spatial Forms in ElblƒÖg (1965), where his sculptures can still be seen in the municipal spaces. In his spare time, he wrote sonnets, which are estimated to number approximately 4000. Some of them were published in 1988 in two volumes. Szwacz took part in many exhibitions around Europe including France, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Serbia, Norway and Turkmenistan. In the 1940s, and again in the 1970s, his work was presented at exhibitions featuring contemporary Polish art in New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C.

He is probably best known for his work designing and building the Hiawatha trains for the Milwaukee Road. Early career Karl Fritjof Nystrom was born in Asba Bruk, Sweden in 1881. He graduated in 1904 as a mechanical engineer from the Mining School at Filipstad, Sweden. To pay for his education he worked summer jobs in machine shops in Stockholm and in steel mills in other parts of the country. Following graduation he went to Germany to study high tensile steel, but before finishing his studies he decided to seek employment in Pittsburgh, the center of the US steel industry. He worked as a ‚Äòblueprint boy‚Äô and then as an engineer at the Midland Steel Company, before obtaining employment for Pressed Steel Car Company as a draftsman. His work at Pressed Steel Car apparently caused Nystrom to decide to focus his career on railcar design and manufacture. It appears that he may have decided to leave Pressed Steel during the Pressed Steel Car strike of 1909, because he joined Pullman in the later part of that year, where he was co-designer of the first steel sleeping car. He also established the specifications for the first all- steel railway post office car. He moved through a fairly rapid succession of railcar jobs, working for the Southern Pacific during the electrification of its Oakland-Alameda line, where he designed and built their first electric interurban cars, for the American Car & Foundry Company, for the Acme Supply Company, for the Grand Trunk (the Canadian National) and for the Canadian Pacific. Milwaukee Road In 1922, Nystrom was appointed engineer of car design for the Milwaukee Road ‚Äì and worked there for the rest of his career. He quickly rose through the ranks, eventually becoming chief mechanical officer of the company. Nystrom had close to 100 patents to his credit. He was an innovator in many aspects of railcar design, but his principal distinction was the development of welded lightweight freight and passenger railcars, for his design of car wheel assemblies (trucks) for passenger railcars which were considered the smoothest riding in the industry, and for the cars for the Hiawatha trails where he played a leading role in designing the well-known bay window cabooses.August Derleth, The Milwaukee Road: Its First Hundred Years, Creative Age Press, New York, 1948, p. 261 He also perfected steam jet air conditioning for passenger cars. By employing high-tensile steels in an all- welded design, the Milwaukee Road was able to achieve significant reductions in weight ‚Äì some of their railcars were as much as 4.5 tons lighter than similar cars of the riveted construction.The Milwaukee Magazine, published by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railway Company, July 1947, p. 10 Other activities Nystrom served for several years on the board of supervisors of Marquette University, where in recognition of distinctive work he received an honorary PhD in mechanical engineering from that university in 1941. He was a consultant for the War Department Transportation Corps and a member of the War Production Board. In 1945 he was elected a Fellow in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ‚Äì only about one percent of ASME members are elected to the grade of Fellow.

Jenike (16 April 1914 ‚Äì 8 August 2003) was an American engineer who developed and expanded the science of bulk material handling. He founded and served as company president for engineering consulting firm Jenike & Johanson, Inc. and published Utah Engineering Experiment Station Bulletins 123 and 108, which introduce the idea of mass flow. Early life Andrew Jenike was born in Poland on April 16, 1914. He graduated from the Warsaw University of Technology with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 1939. Upon graduation, he entered the Polish Army, where he served with distinction as an officer in the Second World War. In peacetime, Jenike attended the University of London where in 1949 he received his Ph.D. in Structural Engineering. While in England, he met his wife Una, and they immigrated to Canada and then to Salt Lake City, Utah in the United States. Career In his early career, Jenike worked for several engineering design firms as a mechanical and structural engineer. At age 39, Jenike began studying the design of bins and hoppers for the storage and flow of bulk solids. He approached the National Science Foundation and other groups for research funding. They required him to be affiliated with a college or university, so Jenike became an associate research professor at the University of Utah where he spent seven years developing basic theories, test equipment, and design procedures. In 1957, he was appointed as vice chairman of the Utah Engineers Council. A combination of some of his crude bin pressure measurements and the idea presented in V. V. Sokolovskii's book, Statics of Soil Media (Butterworth's Scientific, 1960) that soil stress varies directly proportional to the distance from a point gave rise to his Radial Stress Field concept. Jenike is most strongly associated with the Jenike Shear Tester, which bears his name. Jenike developed the continuum mechanics approach to hopper design. He set forth these guiding principles in University of Utah Experimental Station Bulletins 108 and 123, the latter being one of the most cited work in the material handling field today. In these bulletins he defined \\"mass flow,\\" showed how the flow properties of bulk solids could be measured, and how these measurements could be used to design hoppers. Jenike was also the first to recognize the impact feeders play on achieving mass flow in a hopper. Jenike designed the first mass flow bins for iron ore in 1960. In 1962, Jenike moved to Winchester, Massachusetts and entered full-time consulting. Four years later he was joined by Jerry Johanson, who had formerly worked with Jenike in graduate school. In 1966 Jenike incorporated the company Jenike & Johanson, Inc. The company was initially headquartered in the basement of Jenike's house. Jenike was president of the firm until he retired in 1979. He continued to conduct research for about eight years until, in 1987, a serious automobile accident prevented him from working further. Awards and recognitions Jenike received the Humboldt Prize in 1976; in 1989 he was elected Fellow of the ASME; and in 1993 he became the first person outside of the United Kingdom to receive the Solids Handling Award from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In 2007 the British Material Handling Board officially recognized Jenike as the leading Bulk Technology Pioneer of the 20th Century on the grounds of \\"his outstanding contribution that transformed the storage and handling of bulk solids from an empirical industry to a science.\\"  References  1914 births 2003 deaths 20th-century American engineers Warsaw University of Technology alumni Alumni of the University of London University of Utah faculty Alexander von Humboldt Fellows ","title":"Andrew Jenike"},{"id":"47128469","text":"Cape Saint Ann is the northwest extremity of Sherborough Island, Sierra Leone.

He received the UEFA Pro Licence on 30 November 2013 from the Royal Spanish Football Federation. He also holds the A Coaching License since 2009 from Royal Moroccan Football Federation and the UEFA A License since 2010 from the Royal Spanish Football Federation. He is also the holder of First Degree and Second Degree diplomas from Andalusia Football Federation (FAF). La Mojonera He began his managerial career with Divisiones Regionales de F√∫tbol in Andalusia club La Mojonera C.F. in 2000. Polideportivo Ejido In 2002, he moved to El Ejido where he was appointed as the head coach of Segunda Divisi√≥n club, Polideportivo Ejido. In the 2004‚Äì05 Segunda Divisi√≥n, he helped the El Ejido- based club to secure the 13th position in the league table with 52 points from 12 wins and 16 draws and in the 2005‚Äì06 Segunda Divisi√≥n his club secured the 15th position in the league table with 53 points from 15 wins and 8 draws, thus ending his two-year stay at the club. Raja Casablanca He moved back to his home country Morocco where he was appointed as the assistant coach (to Spanish coach Paco Fortes) of the region's topmost club, Raja Casablanca. In his one-year stay at the Casablanca-based club, he along with his senior Paco Fortes lead the club to its first Arab Champions League title in 2006 when his side defeated ENPPI Club of Egypt 3-1 on aggregate in the finals. Fath Union Sport His return to Morocco and the huge achievement with Raja Casablanca saw him being appointed as the head coach and also the technical director of his parent club, Fath Union Sport in 2007. However, the emotional return was not a very successful one for both the club and the Spanish manager as the Rabat-based club was relegated to Botola 2 as the finished in the relegation zone at the 15th position with 26 points from 4 wins and 14 draws in the 2007‚Äì08 Botola. Las Norias C.F. In 2008, he returned to Spain where he was appointed as the head coach of Las Norias C.F. US T√©mara The year 2009 saw the Morocco-born returning to his home country where he was appointed as the head coach of Botola 2 club, US T√©mara. He helped the club secure the 13th position with 39 points from 8 wins and 15 draws in the 2010‚Äì11 GNF 2 (also known as Botola 2). Al-Tali'aa In 2012, he again moved out of Spain and this time to the Middle East and more accurately to Oman where he signed a one-year contract with Oman Elite League club, Al- Tali'aa SC in September 2012 before the beginning of the 2012‚Äì13 Oman Elite League. Fanja Hicham Jadrane - Fanja SC In March 2013, 2011‚Äì12 Oman Elite League winners, Fanja SC appointed him as the head coach of the club for the rest of the 2012-13 season and also for the inaugural season of Oman Professional League in 2013-14. In his very first season at the Muscat-based club, he helped them secure the runners-up position in the 2012‚Äì13 Oman Elite League as his side lost 3-1 against Al-Suwaiq Club in the Championship Play- off (both the clubs finished with 50 points at the end of the season), hence helping them to qualify for the 2014 AFC Cup. Before the beginning of the inaugural season of Oman Professional League, he and his club were very lucky as they got the services of 12 international players who had and are representing Oman in various international competitions. His first match in- charge of the club in the 2013-14 Oman Professional League ended on a disappointing note as his side was held to a 1-1 draw by 2011‚Äì12 Oman Elite League runners-up, Al-Shabab Club. Soon after the match, he was criticized by the fans for not packing his squad with senior players available in the club. Later in the second week of the league, his side hosted newly promoted side Al-Ittihad at the Al-Seeb Stadium and the Morocco-born coach's side well silenced the criticizers as they registered an authoritative 4-2 win over Salalah-based club. The Morocco-born Spanish coach soon became a media star in Oman due to his impressive performances with the club, which included a 5-0 victor over Majees SC and qualification for the 2013 AFC Cup. In his first ever appearance in an Asian Football Confederation tournament as the head coach of any club, the 2013 AFC Cup, he began his campaign in the third week of the tournament in a 1-0 loss against Erbil SC of Iraq. After their first loss in the 2013 edition of the AFC Cup, they next faced the Iraqi side in a home match at Al-Seeb Stadium. The visitors shocked the Omani side as the posted a 4-0 victory over Fanja. His side next faced Al-Ansar SC of Lebanon away at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Beirut, whom they had previously defeated 4-0 at home under Omani coach Mohsin Al-Kharusi. The Lebanese side managed to hold the 2011‚Äì12 Oman Elite League winners to a 0-0 draw. His side faced Al-Ahli Taizz S.C. in their final encounter of the Group Stage and recorded a 3-1 victory over the Yemeni side thus securing a spot in the Round of 16. In the knockout stage, his side were sorted with a tough opponent, Al-Qadsia SC and as expected the home team secured a 4-0 victory over the Omani side thus eliminating Hicham Jardrane's side from contention. In his second consecutive appearance in an Asian Football Confederation tournament as the head coach of any club, the 2014 AFC Cup, he faced a tough competition as his side was drawn with 2012 and 2013 AFC Cup winners, Kuwait SC. In his first AFC Cup match on 26 February 2014 against Syrian club Al- Jaish SC, his side disappointed the whole of nation as they were held to a 0-0 draw against a comparatively lower-leveled side. In their second Group B fixture against defending champions Kuwait SC, Fanja stunned many as they posted a 2-1 victory over the Kuwaiti side. They next faced Nejmeh SC of Lebanon in an away match but the visitors failed to even get a point from the tie as the Lebanese side secured a 1-0 victory over Fanja SC. In their next encounter against the same Lebanese side at home, Fanja managed to secure a point as the match ended in a 0-0 draw at Al-Seeb Stadium. On 5 April 2013, Hicham's side faced relegation threatened Sohar SC in an OPL match at the Sohar Regional Sports Complex and the Spanish coach's side had to face a 1-0 loss against the home side. On 6 April 2013, Hicham stepped down as the head coach of Fanja SC citing medical reasons but the football pundits in Oman claimed that this resignation came as a result of the club's 1-0 loss against Sohar SC. Al-Nahda Al-Nahda Club Al-Nahda Club File:HichamJadraneNahda.jpg File:JadrHichNahda.jpg File:JadraneHichamNahdaT.jpg File:HichamJadraneTra.jpg In June 2015, news speculated that Hicham will return to the Middle East and more accurately to Oman where he would coach Omani giants, Dhofar S.C.S.C. for the 2015‚Äì16 Oman Professional League season. However, this deal failed to materialize and as a result he was appointed as the manager of Al-Buraimi-based Al-Nahda Club. On 21 July 2015, he signed a one-year contract to be appointed as the manager of Al-Nahda Club. His club began the 2015-16 Oman Professional League campaign on a disappointing note as they faced a huge upset from lower-level side, Al- Musannah SC as they lost 2-1 in their home at the Al-Buraimi Sports Complex. Buildcon Football Club In February 2017, Hicham Jadrane Chazouani engaged with the club of Zambian Superleague Buildcon Football Club.

David Karp, LA Times. http://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-marketwatch-20110128-story.html The Dancy originated in 1867, as a seedling grown by Colonel Francis L. Dancy. It was called tangerine because its parent, the Moragne tangerine, was believed to come from Morocco. It has an intense, medium-sweet flavour, and its juice is more strongly-flavoured than orange juice. It is known (and sometimes named) for its loose, pliable peel, which is mainly orange flavedo, with very little bitter white mesocarp (also called albedo or pith). This allows the peel to be eaten fresh and used to flavour dishes like tangerine beef. The Dancy may be a pure mandarin, unlike many commercial citrus cultivars, which are hybrids. Classification Ch≈çzabur≈ç Tanaka classified the Dancy in Citrus tangerina; he thought it was similar or identical to the obenimikan of Japan, and close to the Keonla and Ladu mandarins of India. Under the Swingle classification, the Dancy is classed in Citrus reticulata, the mandarin group. Commercial decline Until the 1970s, most tangerines grown and eaten in the US were Dancys. It is no longer widely commercially grown; it is too delicate to ship well, it is susceptible to Alternaria fungus, and it bears more heavily in alternate years; the thin skin also transpires in storage, and it was difficult to harvest mechanically. Some hybrids are also more cold-hardy than Dancy. 2012 was the first year since 1874 that no Dancys were sold on the US market. The cultivar is still widely sold by nurseries for backyard planting. Hybrid descendants The Dancy is a parent of many hybrid cultivars. Pomelo hybrids * Minneola * Orlando * Sampson * Seminole Orange hybrids * Dweet tangor * Mency tangor * Pixie * Frua (backcrossed with a Pixie) The Dancy has been thought to be the pollen parent of the Orri and Fortune hybrids, but this is not upheld by genetic tests.http://www.ishs.org/ishs-article/1065_55 References Citrus Citrus hybrids ","title":"Dancy (citrus)"},{"id":"47128584","text":"Erigeron latifolius is a rare and little-known Chinese species of flowering plants in the daisy family.

Castle da Rocha Forte is a ruined fort near Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia, Spain. It was first mentioned in written documents from 1253, but it had probably been built earlier. The castle was situated in a strategic location by road from Padr√≥n village to Santiago. Pilgrims followed that route from Portugal. The castle is not on top of a hill as many other forts are, but in a valley where it could control all of the traffic into town. In addition to its purpose for defence, the castle was also a home for the Archbishop, which could provide the men of the local church a shelter from rioting citizens. In 1317, Berenguel de Landoira was nominated as Archbishop. The residents did not like him and started a rebellion. Archbishop Landoira had all the leaders of the rebellion executed. In the 15th century in Irmandi√±o wars the castle was damaged badly and it was abandoned. Later, in 1472 the walls were dismantled. During the Franco era the ruins were used as a hideout. In 1962, an electricity pylon was installed to the castle area.  History  Possible castle reconstruction. The castle was built by Archbishop Juan Arias around 1240 and has since served as an archbishop's and cabildo's residence, witnessing much of the medieval history of Santiago. In the year 1255 appears the first documentary mention of the fortress in relation to the capitular constitutions of Juan Arias. It also preserves the written testimony of the reconstruction carried out by Berenguel de Landoria after the ravages caused by the citizens of Compostela in 1320, in which it was the first documented confrontation of the many that took place between the town of Compostela and The Bishopric in those times. He was in charge of the uprising Alfonso Su√°rez de Deza, a personage of the Deza-Churruchaos family and butler of the son of Sancho IV de Le√≥n and Castile, the infant Felipe. These clashes were collected in the document \\"Acts of Don Berenguel de Landoria\\" in which it is narrated how on the day of the purification the citizens of Compostela attacked and burned the castle, having to be raised again by the archbishop. It also underwent substantive modifications mandated by the southern archbishop Lope de Mendoza.  Current Status  Since 2001, a series of archaeological excavations have been carried out, thanks to an agreement between the City Council of Santiago and the University of Santiago de Compostela, in order to recover the deposit and consolidate it by means of the creation of an Archaeological Park.

The Rybicki‚ÄìPress algorithm is a fast direct algorithm for inverting a matrix, whose entries are given by A(i,j) = exp(-a vert t_i - t_j vert), where a in mathbb{R}. It is a computational optimization of a general set of statistical methods developed to determine whether two noisy, irregularly sampled data sets are, in fact, dimensionally shifted representations of the same underlying function. The most common use of the algorithm is in the detection of periodicity in astronomical observations. Recently, this method has been extended (Generalized Rybicki Press algorithm) for inverting matrices whose entries of the form A(i,j) = sum_{k=1}^p a_k exp(-beta_k vert t_i - t_j vert). The key observation in the Generalized Rybicki Press (GPP) algorithm is that the matrix A is a semi- separable matrix with rank p. More precisely, if the matrix A in mathbb{R}^{ntimes n} has a semi-separable rank is p, the cost for solving the linear system Ax=b and obtaining the determinant of the matrix scales as mathcal{O}left(p^2n right), thereby making it extremely attractive for large matrices. This implementation of the GPP algorithm can be found here. The key idea is that the dense matrix A can be converted into a sparser matrix of a larger size (see figure on the right), whose sparsity structure can be leveraged to reduce the computational complexity. The fact that matrix A is a semi-separable matrix also forms the basis for library, which is a library for fast and scalable Gaussian Process (GP) Regression in one dimension with implementations in C++, Python, and Julia. The method also provides an algorithm for generating samples from a high-dimensional distribution. The method has found attractive applications in a wide range of fields, especially in astronomical data analysis. References .

The Emeco 1006, known as the Navy Chair, has been in continuous production since the 1940s. Today, Emeco manufactures furniture designed by designers and architects such as Philippe Starck and Norman Foster. History Wilton C. Dinges founded the Electric Machine and Equipment Company (Emeco) in 1944 with $300 in savings and a used lathe for machine-work. He started bidding on government manufacturing contracts out of a loft in Baltimore, Maryland, beginning with experimental antennas and jet engine parts. Dinges moved to Hanover, Pennsylvania in 1946 in order to take advantage of the local labor market. He obtained 10,000 pounds of aluminum scrap metal at an attractive price and started using it to build dining table legs. Later he manufactured chair frames and eventually focused completely on aluminum chairs in 1948. The Emeco 1006 chair the company would become known for was one of several furniture products, such as bunks and lockers, Emeco made for the US Navy's fleet during World War II, out of an anodized aluminum material. The business grew by under-bidding other manufacturers on government contracts for office building furniture. By 1953, there were four Emeco factories in Hanover. By 1955, Emeco was producing 200,000 chairs per year. Dinges developed the chairs and Emeco's manufacturing process, but he was not a good businessman and due to the elaborate manufacturing process, found it hard to generate a profit. By 1979 the company was not receiving enough new government contracts to stay in business and was nearing bankruptcy. Emeco was sold that year to Jay Buchbinder who tried unsuccessfully to revive the military end of the business. Buchbinder's son, Gregg, acquired Emeco from his father in 1998. He noticed that Giorgio Armani and other designers showed an interest in the 1006 chair, so he decided to focus on those and similar products. In 1999 the company posted a profit for the first time in more than 20 years. Gregg met French designer Philippe Starck at the 1998 International Contemporary Furniture Fair and the two agreed to collaborate on numerous designer versions of the 1006 Navy chair. By 2004 these accounted for half of Emeco's production, or 46,500 chairs per year.  Use of Recycled & Reclaimed Materials  Emeco is noted for their use of recycled and reclaimed materials. The Coca-Cola Company and Emeco partnered to re-create the Navy Chair using rPET plastic bottles; the 111 Navy Chair became available in 2010. Philippe Starck and Emeco revived a 2001 design, the Broom Chair, making it with a formula combining waste polypropylene and reclaimed wood fiber. Broom was launched in 2012. In 2015, the Emeco Alfi Chair was introduced. The Alfi seat is made of 100% discarded industrial waste ‚Äì 92.5% polypropylene and 7.5% wood fiber.  Legal actions   Restoration Hardware  In October 2012, Emeco filed a lawsuit against Restoration Hardware for allegedly violating their trademark and trade dress by selling look-alikes of the Emeco Navy chair, which Restoration Hardware called the ‚ÄúNaval Chair‚Äù. Restoration Hardware renamed the chair, then removed them from their website. In January 2013, Restoration Hardware agreed to stop selling the disputed chairs and to recycle their existing stock.  IKEA  Emeco filed a design right and copyright infringement case against Swedish furniture giant IKEA in 2015, alleging that IKEA‚Äôs Melltorp dining chair was similar to the Emeco 20-06 Stacking Chair designed by Norman Foster in 2006. In May 2016 Emeco accepted an out-of-court settlement from IKEA, both companies issued a joint statement announcing that a deal had been reached. Details of the deal remain confidential.

It was landmark study that extensively reorganized cactus taxonomy and is still considered a cornerstone of the field. It was illustrated with drawings and color plates principally by the British botanical artist Mary Emily Eaton as well as with black-and-white photographs. History Watercolor of several Opuntia cactus species by Mary Emily Eaton for Britton and Rose's The Cactaceae, 1919 (vol. 1, plate XXXIV). Nathaniel Lord Britton was a Columbia University geology and biology professor who left the university in 1895 to become the founding director of the New York Botanical Garden. Much of his own field work was done in the Caribbean. Joseph Nelson Rose was an authority on several plant families, including parsley (Apiaceae) and cacti (Cactaceae). He had been a plant curator at the Smithsonian since 1896, and while working there he made several field trips to Mexico, collecting specimens for the Smithsonian and for Britton's newly founded New York Botanical Garden. Together, Britton and Rose published many articles on the stonecrop family (Crassulaceae) before embarking in 1904 on research leading towards The Cactaceae. With the support of Douglas T. MacDougal, director of the Carnegie Institution for Science's Desert Botanical Laboratory, the Carnegie Institution agreed to fund the project. Rose took a leave of absence from the Smithsonian to pursue it, and both Rose and Britton were named Carnegie Institution Research Associates in 1912, when more focused work on the project began. Between 1912 and 1916 Rose and Britton did extensive field work, collecting specimens and touring the botanical gardens and notable collections of Europe, the Caribbean, and North, Central, and South America. In this period, cactus taxonomy was in a disorganized state with only a few very large and heterogeneous genera. Britton and Rose broke these old-style catch-all genera into smaller, more defined genera, ultimately classifying 1255 species under 124 genera. It has been argued that with this first major overhaul of cactus genera, they ushered in an era of 'splitting' or liberalism in cactus taxonomy, in contrast to the conservative 'lumping' approach that characterized their predecessors. Britton and Rose defined their genera by the characteristics of the cactus plants' vegetation, flowers, and fruit, as well as by their geographic distribution. They drew on their own and others' field work, as well as on greenhouse studies and specimens in herbaria to describe species included in their exhaustive study. An important aspect of their work was their careful reexamination of existing type specimens, many of which turned out to have been incorrectly identified. Britton and Rose published The Cactaceae in four volumes through the Carnegie Institution between 1919 and 1923. It \\"set new standards in cactus botany\\" and has been called Britton's \\"magnum opus\\". Though it was considered definitive in its own day, the taxonomy of Cactaceae has remained problematic, due in part to difficulties in preserving type specimens of cactus. Several taxonomic reorganizations have succeeded Britton and Rose's work, with the most recent major one dating to 1984. (See Cactus entry for more details.) Despite this, the excellence of their work is reflected in the fact that some 50 of the 79 genera they authored are still considered phylogenetically sound, though some have been redefined. A black-and-white reprint of the second (1937) edition of The Cactaceae was published by Dover Publications in 1963. In 2006, Daniel Schweich undertook a project to digitize the entire book, and all four volumes can now be downloaded in full color. Illustrations Watercolor of three species of Cactaceae by Mary Emily Eaton for Britton and Rose's The Cactaceae, 1919 (vol. 1, plate III). In 1911, the British illustrator Mary Emily Eaton moved to New York, where she was employed by the New York Botanical Garden for two decades. The great majority of color plates in the four volumes of The Cactaceae are by Eaton, with a handful by other artists such as Deborah Griscom Passmore, Helen Adelaide Wood, and Kako Morita. Eaton's compositions are striking and her watercolors are noted for their crispness and accuracy of botanical detail. The color plates are supplemented by black-and-white line drawings as well as by black-and-white photographs of cacti, ranging from long shots taken in the field to close-up details. One contemporary reviewer called The Cactaceae ‚Äúthe most sumptuous botanical publication\\" since William Rickatson Dykes‚Äô 1913 book The Genus Iris.

The Governor of Bayburt (Turkish: Bayburt Valiliƒüi) is the bureaucratic state official responsible for both national government and state affairs in the Province of Bayburt. Similar to the Governors of the 80 other Provinces of Turkey, the Governor of Bayburt is appointed by the Government of Turkey and is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Bayburt. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Bayburt provincial police force and the Bayburt Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Bayburt is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Bayburt is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Bayburt. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Bayburt, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Bayburt Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Bayburt has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

She was bred in Virginia, was sold for a world record price for a foal and sent to race in Europe. As a juvenile she showed very good form, winning three of her five races including a victory over male opposition in the Mill Reef Stakes. In the following year she recorded her most important success when winning the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. She went on to have a long and successful second career as a broodmare. Background Magic of Life was a \\"strong, lengthy\\" bay mare with a white blaze and white socks on her hind legs bred in Virginia by Newstead Farm. She was sired by Seattle Slew who won the American Triple Crown in 1977 before becoming an influential breeding stallion. His other offspring included Swale, Landaluce, Slew o' Gold and A.P. Indy. Magic of Life's dam Larida was a high-class racemare who won ten races including the Orchid Handicap. At the dispersal of the Newstead breeding stock in November 1985, Magic of Life was offered for auction and was sold for $2.5 million, a world record price for a foal which stood for twelve years. She entered the ownership of the Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos and was sent to Europe where she was trained by Jeremy Tree at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. She was ridden in most of her races by the Irish jockey Pat Eddery. Racing career 1987: two-year-old season On her racecourse debut, Magic of Life contested the West Ilsley Maiden Stakes over five furlongs at Newbury Racecourse and won by one and a half lengths from Jodoka. She was then moved up in class and distance for the Group Three Cherry Hinton Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in July. She started the 100/30 second favourite and finished one and a half lengths into second by the Henry Cecil-trained Diminuendo, after appearing to be outpaced by the winner in the closing stages. She was well-fancied for the Princess Margaret Stakes at Ascot later in the month, but after disputing the lead for most of the way she faded in the final furlong and finished third of the five runners behind Bluebook. In August she was dropped in class and won a minor race over six furlongs at Windsor Racecourse. On her final appearance of the season, Magic of Life was matched against colts for the first time in the Group Two Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury. She was made the 4/1 second favourite behind Rahy who had won his two previous starts including the Sirenia Stakes, with the best of the other three runners appearing to be the Gimcrack Stakes runner-up Intimidate. Eddery restrained the filly at the rear of the field before moving into second place behind Intimidate two furlongs out. She moved alongside the leader in the final furlong before drawing ahead to win by three quarters of a length, with a gap of five lengths back to Rahy in third place. 1988: three-year-old season On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Magic of Life ran in the 175th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 28 April. The French-trained filly Ravinella started odds-on favourite ahead of Diminuendo and the Nell Gwyn Stakes winner Ghariba with Magic of Life next in the betting at odds of 12/1. She never looked likely to win and finished seventh of the twelve runners, twelve lengths behind Ravinella. After the race she was found to be suffering from a respiratory infection: in Tree's words she had \\"muck in her lungs\\". The 139th running of the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 15 June was the first time that the race had been run as a Group One race. Ravinella, who had added to her Newmarket success by winning the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches started 4/6 favourite whilst Magic of Life was a 16/1 outsider in the eight-runner field. The other contenders included Ohsomellow, an unbeaten filly from the Luca Cumani stable, Ashayer (winner of the Prix Marcel Boussac), Action Fran√ßaise (Prix de Sandringham) and Harmless Albatross (Prix des Ch√™nes). Magic of Life was restrained by Eddery towards the rear of the field in the early stages and was sixth behind Ohsomellow on the final turn. She made rapid progress when switched to the outside in the straight, took the lead approaching the final furlong, and won by two lengths from the 33/1 outsider Inchmurrin (ridden by Eddery's brother Paul), with a gap of four lengths back to Ravinella in third place. Ravinella's jockey Gary Moore admitted \\"we were beaten on the day by a better filly\\". After a break of more than two months, Magic of Life returned for the Waterford Crystal Mile in which she was matched against colts and older horses and started second favourite alongside Doyoun behind the 1986 winner Then Again. She finished fourth of the six runners behind Prince Rupert, Then Again and Doyoun, beaten three lengths by the winner. On her final appearance, Magic of Life started at odds of 14/1 for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on 24 September. She never looked likely to win and finished seventh of the eight runners behind Warning. Assessment In 1987 the independent Timeform organisation awarded Magic of Life a rating of 113, eight pounds below their best-two-year old filly Ravinella. In the official International Classification she was rated ten pounds inferior to the French filly. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Magic of Life became a broodmare for her Stavros Niarchos's stud, and on his death in 1996 she was transferred to the Niarchos family's Flaxman Holdings breeding organisation. At the Keeneland Sales in November 1998 she was offered for sale and bought for $610,000 by David Nagle's Barronstown Stud. He later foals were officially bred by Padelco, a breeding company connected to the Coolmore Stud. She produced at least thirteen foals and seven winners between 1990 and 2009: *Circle of Chalk, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1990, sired by Kris.

The childhood friends from Magnolia, Texas, write songs about everyday life that are a combination of harmonies that merge Southern country, Americana and Western rock music. Their first album Utah was originally self- released in early 2014 and then re-released by Republic Records later the same year. iTunes named Utah Best of 2014: Singer-Songwriter Album of the Year. Jamestown Revival has been featured in Rolling Stone magazine and covered in the Wall Street Journal. The band has made appearances at music festivals in the U.S., including the South by Southwest (SXSW) music festival in Austin, Texas, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, Austin City Limits Music Festival, and a musical appearance on Conan. History Zach Chance and Jonathan Clay grew up together in Magnolia, Texas, and collaborated on their first song at the age of 15. Each launched solo singer-songwriter careers and were on tour as individual artists who would sing harmonies on each other's work. It was decided to form a band with harmonies at the forefront as it generated positive audience response. Jamestown Revival was formed in 2010 as a duo and expanded to a five-member band. The name Jamestown Revival was derived from one of the first United States settlements, Jamestown, Virginia, homage to Creedence Clearwater Revival, and the concept of leaving behind the old and starting anew. The band wrote music they wanted to hear rather than what appealed to the masses using the music they listened to as a gauge of quality of their work. The band's music inspirations come from storytellers of adventure such as Louis L'Amour, Willie Nelson and John Prine as well as nature, and simplicity. Jamestown Revival's first album, Utah, was named for the band's recording location in the Wasatch mountains, Utah, where while living in a cabin they used minimal recording studio equipment to create a unique style.

The EP would go through years of delays for a multitude of reasons, including extensive touring, prioritizing the completion of their third studio album Out of the Vein, and complications arising from parting ways with Elektra in 2004. The EP itself was never collectively released, though many of the tracks were eventually released elsewhere. Background After the band's six times platinum-selling self-titled Third Eye Blind album, the band reconvened to record a follow up album, Blue, in early 1999. During the Blue sessions, the band recorded a track called \\"Slow Motion\\" which had been used in their 1994 demo tape. However, Elektra, the band's record label, did not approve of the song's lyrical content about a student who shoots a teacher's son, with the Columbine High School massacre having just occurred the same year. The band argued with the label for over four months over the content and its inclusion on the album. The final agreement between the two parties was that the song could only be on the album as an instrumental, but in return, Elektra would finance a separate EP where the song could be placed with its full controversial lyrics. While the arrangement was made just prior to the release of Blue, work on the EP, tentatively titled Black as a companion release to Blue, wasn't set to begin until late 2000, upon completion of the \\"Red Summer Sun Tour\\" in support of Blue. However, in 2000, frontman Stephan Jenkins fell into a state of depression, which led him to recluse himself into a productive period of writing, resulting in over 40 new songs. This activity led the band to focus on releasing another full-length album first - what would become Out of the Vein - with intentions of releasing an EP afterwards. After the Out of the Vein sessions, the band started referring to the EP title as Symphony of Decay. A month after the release of Out of the Vein, in June 2003, Jenkins stated to VH1 that the band planned on releasing the EP as soon as September of the same year. However, the EP was later delayed into 2004, and then again into 2005. Drummer Brad Hargreaves, in late 2004, indicated that the EP had become tied up with difficulties with their record label, with Elektra dropping the band after the low sales of Out of the Vein. Concept The terms of the compromise resulting in the EP's conception gave the band considerable freedom in their work; it was financed by Elektra, but ultimately treated as an independent release, allowing the band creative control. The EP was envisioned as a seven to eight song release where the songs would flow together and collectively have a run-time of about 50 minutes, resulting in lengthier run-times for some songs. Jenkins described the band's intent as wanting to \\"perform like a little symphony\\" to ultimately \\"make something really beautiful\\", while the band's manager at the time, Eric Godtland, stated that they would be \\"stringing together songs\\" to create \\"more of a cohesive vision that flows.\\" Aftermath While the EP was never officially released, a number of the tracks eventually found release in various forms. The full- lyrics version of \\"Slow Motion\\" finally found a vehicle for its official release in the band's 2006 greatest hits album A Collection. The vocals and piano recording of \\"My Time in Exile\\" was also included on A Collection. The track \\"Carnival Barker\\", in its entirety, was released as a free download by the band in 2006, while a brief clip of it was included as the closing track of the band's fourth album, Ursa Major. The track \\"There's No Hurry to Eternity\\" was eventually released on the charity benefit compilation album Live from Nowhere Near You Vol. II in 2011. The track had previously been titled as \\"Elliott Smith\\". \\"Knife in the Water\\", \\"Animal\\", and the full band version of \\"My Time in Exile\\" all unofficially leaked onto the internet between 2005 and 2006. No versions of \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Swimming\\" have ever been released or leaked, although the latter was temporarily listed as a potential track for Ursa Major. In 2008, the band would finally release an EP, the unrelated, politically-themed three track EP Red Star.

Produced by Skybound Entertainment, it was released on August 14, 2015 in the United States. Plot A chemical weapons catastrophe has wiped out most of mankind and rendered the air un-breathable. The US government hastily built a few makeshift underground bunkers in which a few scientists are kept in cryogenic sleep until the air is no longer toxic. Each of those bunkers is kept up by a couple of maintenance workers who are awoken for two hours every six months in order to perform routine tasks and inspections to keep the facility going. The story begins with two workers of one such facility, Cartwright (Hounsou) and Bauer (Reedus). They go about their normal list of tasks during one wake cycle. Cartwright has occasional visions of his wife Abby (Holt) and has conversations with her, to Bauer's annoyance. Just as the two hours are almost over, Cartwright's sleeping chamber is destroyed by a fire that was caused by recent seismic activity. The two frantically locate the valve for the emergency air supply, and then try to find a spare chamber for Cartwright to sleep in. The chamber is operational, and Bauer chooses to use it. However, the chamber malfunctions and almost suffocates Bauer until Cartwright finally appears and cuts him free, destroying the chamber in the process. With no other spare chamber in the facility, Bauer insists that they eject a random sleeping person to allow Cartwright to occupy that chamber. Cartwright refuses to send anyone to their death and insists there is another way. He exits the facility in a hazmat suit in an attempt to enter a nearby sister facility, with Bauer on the radio helping him navigate. Cartwright encounters several corpses as he makes his way through air ducts. When he finally enters the facility, he realizes that everybody there is dead, and has been for a long time already. Although the computer system has reported all facility workers to be alive and well during the previous wake cycles, it is apparent that this was a ruse to make the workers believe they're not alone in order for them to stay sane. At the same time, Bauer reviews the security footage and realizes that Cartwright was standing next to him the entire time while he almost suffocated in the spare chamber, indicating that Cartwright had tried to kill him and only decided against it in the last minute. As Cartwright returns to their own facility, Bauer confronts him with a gun. A chase through the facility ensues, with Cartwright finally getting the upper hand by sneaking up on Bauer and injecting a large dose of morphine into him. Bauer accepts his fate, and makes peace with Cartwright before passing out. In an epilogue, Cartwright wakes up for another cycle, appearing to have aged many decades. The air is breathable again, and the facility's system is automatically waking up all the sleepers who exit their chambers and walk up to the Earth's surface, with Abby among them. Cast * Norman Reedus as Bauer * Djimon Hounsou as Cartwright * Sandrine Holt as Abby * Peter Benson as Anchorman * David Nykl as Sleeper 1 Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 33 from 6 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Alan Scherstuhl at The Village Voice said in his review that the film consisted of \\"too many\\" scenes of \\"dudes chasing each other with guns\\", while Ken Jawororski in The New York Times praised the acting of Hounsou and Reedus, while concluding that \\"the script would benefit from more moments when hard questions are considered and unexpected actions are taken\\". However, Jami Philbrick in Crave Online praised the film, stating that \\"Air succeeds where many sci-fi movies fail, by making an unbelievable story completely believable\\", and commented further that \\"filmmaker Christian Cantamessa makes a stunning directorial debut with his new movie\\".

It is native to North America where it is found in the Upper Mississippi Valley. Sometimes adults of this mayfly are so abundant as to cause a nuisance because of their enormous numbers. The larvae are aquatic and burrow in mud and the adult insects have brief lives. Description When the adults are ready to emerge, the mayfly nymphs (larvae) swim to the surface of the water during the night. Their skin splits and winged subimagos struggle free, usually in less than a minute, and fly to nearby trees to rest. They are a dull gray color and have short, coarse legs, bristly cerci and cloudy, grayish wings. Some eight to eighteen hours later, these subimagos moult into mature adults (imagos). These are altogether more delicate in appearance than the subimagos; the wings are transparent, the legs are longer and more slender, the cerci lack bristles, the eyes are larger and the body is patterned in brown and cream. The females are much larger than the males. Distribution and habitat Hexagenia bilineata occurs in the Upper Mississippi Valley. Adults appear in summer and are found near still and slow-moving water. The nymphs are found burrowing in the mud and silt in shallow lakes and slow-moving streams and rivers. This mayfly is generally more abundant than the closely related Hexagenia limbata, but that species becomes more plentiful from Keokuk, Iowa northwards. When a lock was drained near Keokuk in July 1958, 344 nymphs of H. bilineata were found in of sediment. Ecology Around dusk, male imagos congregate in swarms. They often aggregate in the lee of structures such as buildings or trees, or if there is no wind, all round such a structure. Each male occupies a fixed position facing into the wind, about from the next one, stabilizing its position with its cerci. They do not bob up and down as do males of H. limbata. Any female which flies into a swarm is pursued by males until copulation takes place in the air. The male then returns to the swarm, all the members of which will die before morning. The female deposits two packets, each containing several thousand eggs, into the water where they sink to the bottom and stick to the mud. She dies soon afterwards, and any undeposited egg packets may be extruded from her corpse. Each egg hatches a few weeks later and the newly hatched nymph tunnels into the mud and makes a U-shaped burrow. It creates a water current through the burrow which provides it with the oxygen it needs, and from which it filters the organic detritus on which it feeds. It remains in this burrow until it is ready to emerge the following year. This mayfly may have a shorter life cycle than other members of its genus. In the laboratory when kept at a warm temperature it has been reared from egg to adulthood in thirteen weeks, but in the Keokuk area there is believed to be a single generation per year, whereas in Kentucky Lake there is mixed voltinism, with some adults emerging at 14 months and others at 22 months. Human impact Sometimes H. bilineata adults emerge simultaneously in vast numbers. On July 14, 1958, The Des Moines Register reported that the previous evening: > Fish flies controlled the Dubuque Bridge [at Dubuque, Iowa] for 40 minutes, > then surrendered with heavy losses under an armored counter attack by > highway commission scraper-trucks. Riverside trees on which the insects roosted lost branches, houses were covered, visibility was reduced, and many insects were conveyed hundreds of miles on towboats that were pulling barges on the river. The crews of the riverboats called them \\"those big, black bastards\\". On the evening of July 23, 2014 in the La Crosse, Wisconsin area, the insects were airborne in such large numbers that they were detectable on weather radar, the enormous swarm resembling a rainstorm. They are attracted to lights, and their bodies pile up in yards, on roadways and bridges. A triple vehicle accident injuring two people was reported in nearby Trenton, believed to be caused by the slippery conditions caused by the green slime from the squashed corpses.

From 2013 to 2016 he studied and analyzed the ignorance and lack of communication in the Italian culture (different geographical areas). The project called Quod erat demonstrandum was a sort of global provocative act denouncing the current strength of commonplace generated by a culturally superficial society.

The Governor of Sinop (Turkish: Sinop Valiliƒüi) is responsible for the implementation of government legislation within Sinop Province, Turkey. The governorship is a civil service office appointed by the government of Turkey. The Governor is also the most senior commander of both the Sinop provincial police force and the Sinop Gendarmerie. Appointment The Governor of Sinop is appointed by the President of Turkey, who confirms the appointment after recommendation from the Turkish Government. The Ministry of the Interior first considers and puts forward possible candidates for approval by the cabinet. The Governor of Sinop is therefore not a directly elected position and instead functions as the most senior civil servant in the Province of Sinop. Term limits The Governor is not limited by any term limits and does not serve for a set length of time. Instead, the Governor serves at the pleasure of the Government, which can appoint or reposition the Governor whenever it sees fit. Such decisions are again made by the cabinet of Turkey. The Governor of Sinop, as a civil servant, may not have any close connections or prior experience in Sinop Province. It is not unusual for Governors to alternate between several different Provinces during their bureaucratic career. Functions The Governor of Sinop has both bureaucratic functions and influence over local government. The main role of the Governor is to oversee the implementation of decisions by government ministries, constitutional requirements and legislation passed by Grand National Assembly within the provincial borders. The Governor also has the power to reassign, remove or appoint officials a certain number of public offices and has the right to alter the role of certain public institutions if they see fit. Governors are also the most senior public official within the Province, meaning that they preside over any public ceremonies or provincial celebrations being held due to a national holiday. As the commander of the provincial police and Gendarmerie forces, the Governor can also take decisions designed to limit civil disobedience and preserve public order. Although mayors of municipalities and councillors are elected during local elections, the Governor has the right to re-organise or to inspect the proceedings of local government despite being an unelected position.

It was founded in 2009 by Ross Resnick. History During a study abroad program in 2004 while attending University of Southern California, Ross Resnick became immersed in Asian street food culture. Upon his return, Resnick began developing Roaming Hunger originally as the food truck industry started to emerge in 2009. Resnick took it on himself to compile an online directory of food trucks and carts across the US. Resnick did not initially have a business model. As people began to seek his help to book trucks for events, and marketing campaigns, Resnick realized that he could turn his online directory into a business. As of June 2015, Roaming Hunger operates out of West Hollywood with 35 employees. Divisions Roaming Hunger is split into four divisions: Corporate Catering, Public/Private Catering (which includes weddings and receptions), Takeovers/Promotions and Marketplace designed to sell and lease food trucks. Developments Website Roaming Hunger‚Äôs website displays real-time maps showing current locations of food trucks in many major cities and areas, based on the schedules vendors themselves enter by registering on the site, or by data automatically interpreted from a vendor‚Äôs tweets. Each truck, trailer, and cart on the site has a profile with a picture, short description, and the option for the vendor to upload menus, descriptions, and pictures of the food. It also offers search functions to find vendors in an area, vendors serving specific types of food, or a specific truck, trailer, or cart. Website users may ‚Äúlove‚Äù and review a truck, find the top trucks in their area, set an alert to notify them when a favorite truck is serving in their area, and read articles on the Roaming Hunger blog about vendors, food truck events, and food recipes. They may also suggest new trucks to the site, and submit catering requests. App Roaming Hunger's app launched in June 2011 for iOS and November 2014 for Android, offers the same live maps as the website, as well as functionality to favorite vendors, view menus and photos, and read about each vendor.

The area at the mouth of Gardner Creek was settled as early as 1769. A number of mills, including a sawmill and a gristmill, were constructed on the creek in the early 19th century. Numerous bridges were built over it in the 20th century. The creek experienced streambank erosion during Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972. It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce within it. Course Gardner Creek begins in a valley near Newton Ransom Boulevard in Newton Township. It flows southwest for a short distance and enters Corby Swamp. From the western end of the swamp, it flows west-southwest for a short distance before turning south and entering a much deeper valley. The creek then turns southwest for several tenths of a mile before receiving an unnamed tributary from the left. Its valley then becomes narrower and shallower as it turns south-southwest for a few miles, receiving one unnamed tributary from the left and another from the right. The creek turns south for more than a mile and its valley becomes broader and deeper again as it flows past the base of a mountain known as Pinnacle Rock. The creek receives another unnamed tributary from the left before turning west for several tenths of a mile, still flowing through a deep valley. It turns south-southwest for more than a mile and receives two more unnamed tributaries (one from the left and one from the right). It then abruptly turns west-northwest for several tenths of a mile before receiving an unnamed tributary from the right. It then turns south-southwest for more than a mile before leaving its valley and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Gardner Creek joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. Hydrology Gardner Creek is not designated as an impaired stream. Newton Township once requested a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek. The peak annual discharge of Gardner Creek at its mouth has a 10 percent chance of reaching 2350 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 4850 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 6450 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 12,500 cubic feet per second. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Gardner Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. For most of the length of Gardner Creek, the surficial geology on the floor of its valley consists mainly of alluvium. However, alluvial terrace is present in the lower reaches. The valley walls and surrounding areas have surficial geology consisting of a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till and bedrock consisting of coal, conglomeratic sandstone, sandstone, and shale. Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, fill, alluvial fan, peat, and wetlands also occur in the surficial geology in the vicinity of the creek. Watershed The watershed of Gardner Creek has an area of . The creek's mouth is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Ransom. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Scranton. Gardner Creek is the main source of flooding in Ransom Township. The creek is typically \\"placid\\" but can be transformed into a \\"raging torrent\\" by flooding. The watershed of Gardner Creek is one of three major watersheds in Lackawanna County that is in the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin. The others are the Lackawanna River and Tunkhannock Creek. History Gardner Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1198784. The creek is also known as Gardiners Creek and Gardners Creek. John and Richard Gardner settled at their father's farm at the mouth of Gardner Creek in 1769. The Gardner Ferry was established downstream of the mouth of the creek in 1795. It was renamed to the Ransom Ferry in 1923, but still existed in 1937. Elias Smith came from New Jersey and settled in an undeveloped part of Newton Township in 1816 and purchased a tract of along Gardner Creek. Smith also built the first Newton Township's first sawmill on the creek in 1821. Additionally, the first gristmill in Ransom Township was built on the creek by Phineas Sherwood in 1825. Sherwood sold the mill to Absolom Young, who sold it to Jacob Dershimer. In 1844, Dershimer constructed a new mill on the site. Historically, an aqueduct carried the Tunkhannock Line, a canal running from Wyalusing Creek to the Wyoming Division Canal, crossed over Gardner Creek. The aqueduct had one span and was long. A concrete stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 3005 was constructed over Gardner Creek in 1932. It is long and is in Ransom Township. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 3006 was built over the creek in Newton Township in 1951. It is long. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying the same road was built over the creek in 1958. This bridge is also in Newton Township and is long. A bridge of the same type, but carrying State Route 3002, was built across the creek in 1970. This bridge is long and is situated in Ransom Township. A concrete slab bridge with a length of long and carrying State Route 3009 was built over the creek in 1988 in Ransom Township. A prestressed box beam or girdres bridge with a length of long and carrying State Route 3007/Evergreen Road was built across the creek in 1999 in Ransom Township. Gardner Creek experienced significant flooding during Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972. The flood also caused streambank erosion and the inundation of basements and first floors of homes near the creek. Further rains and flash flooding in October 1976 caused more streambank erosion. For this reason, Ransom Township received $7000 in Federal Disaster Assistance Administration Funds to restore the creek's streambanks. Biology The drainage basin of Gardner Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek from its upper reaches downstream to its mouth. It is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be approved trout waters. The creek has been stocked with brown trout and rainbow trout.

More than 100 militants were reportedly killed by the army during the battle.  Attacks  The attacks started at 6:50 am on that day, with the militants attacking Sheikh Zuweid's police station, and several newly established army checkpoints. The attacks were reportedly carried out by more than 300 militants and targeted 15 different security and army positions. Militants used car bombs to attack five military road checkpoints, and were armed with heavy weapons and anti-aircraft weaponry. Militants also planted IEDs on local highways to ambush military response forces.  Sheikh Zuweid Police Station  The fighting for the police station raged for hours as militants laid a siege around the station and tried to breach it. Security sources said that the militants planted bombs and land mines around it to prevent forces from leaving the station and planted bombs along the road between Sheikh Zuweid and al-Zuhour army camp to prevent the movement of army supplies or reinforcements. In spite of the heavy attack on the police station, the militants failed to breach it and the siege was ended with the help of air strikes conducted by Apache helicopters and F-16 jet fighters.  Security Response  In the army's counterattack, the Egyptian Air Force bombed multiple militant positions, and reinforcements from the Second Army Zone stationed in Ismailia, were deployed to Sheikh Zuweid. Air strikes continued to the next day killing 22 militants. The Egyptian military also intensified its offensive in the region destroying multiple militants headquarters and killing hundreds of the militants.  Casualties  The attack left 21 army soldiers dead, including 4 officers, and 9 wounded. An army statement claimed the killing of more than 100 militants from the attacking force and the destruction of 20 of their vehicles. However, unknown Egyptian security and medical officials reported that up to 64 soldiers had been killed in the attacks.Egypt's Sisi rallies troops in Sinai after IS attacks The militant death toll increased in the following days, due to Egyptian military operations in the region, reaching 241 killed.  Responsibility  Wilayah Sinai, the Sinai branch of ISIL, claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement on a Twitter account. The group also published pictures showing the attacks.  Analysis  Officials claimed that the militants sought to take over the city of Sheikh Zuweid. In addition, the ISIS-affiliated group tried to cut off Egyptian Rafah from al-Arish, but the Egyptian army said it was able to foil their attempt and gain full control of the area. Zack Gold, Middle East analyst, views the battle as a change in strategy from hit and run tactics toward an ISIS-like 'holding' of territory. The Egyptian army accused TV channels, including Qatar's Al Jazeera TV, of aiding the militants and spreading rumors to demoralize Egyptians.
