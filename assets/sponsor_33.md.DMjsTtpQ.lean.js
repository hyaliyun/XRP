IMBA was formed in 1988, when five California-based mountain bike clubs created an alliance to fight widespread trail closures. The founding clubs were the Concerned Off Road Bicyclists Association, Bicycle Trails Council of the East Bay, Bicycle Trails Council of Marin, Sacramento Rough Riders and Responsible Organized Mountain Pedalers. Gibson Anderson, of Sacramento, was elected IMBA's first executive director. In 1993 IMBA hired Tim Blumenthal, a former IMBA board member and cycling journalist, as its executive director. When Blumenthal began, the organization had roughly 1,200 individual members and about 60 affiliated clubs. The headquarters moved to Boulder, Colorado, in 1994. In the late 1990s, IMBA's membership grew in Canada, Europe and Australia. An international summit was held in Switzerland in 1997. Educational outreach programs such as the Trail Care Crews ‚Äì traveling trailbuilding schools sponsored by Subaru car corporation ‚Äì helped expand IMBA's reach. At the end of 1999, IMBA had more than 28,000 individual members, 14 staffers and a budget of $1.2 million. In 2006, IMBA's membership grew to 32,000 members, with more than 600 affiliated clubs and patrols and a staff of 26. International programs, including IMBA Canada, are continuing to grow. In the US, IMBA has established partnership agreements with most major federal land management agencies, and is widely recognized as a leading source of information for trail-based recreation. Trail support and maintenance The IMBA strives to promote mountain biking, trail building, and trail maintenance in a way that enhances the local community, and in a way that considers and minimizes the ecological impact to the environment.

It presently houses the Museo di Roma, the \\"museum of Rome\\", covering the history of the city in the period from the Middle Ages through the nineteenth century. History It was built by the papal nephew Duke Luigi Braschi Onesti,He was the son of Count Girolamo Onesti and Giulia Braschi, sister of Pope Pius VI, who created him Duke of Nemi. to designs by Cosimo Morelli. The site was purchased in 1790 by Braschi, supported by funds from Pope Pius VI;The cultural politics of Pius VI are discussed in Jeffrey L. Collins, Papacy and Politics in Eighteenth-Century Rome: Pius VI and the Arts (Cambridge) 2006; ch. 5 details the erection of obelisks and the building of the Palazzo Braschi for his family. Braschi demolished the 16th-century palace that Giuliano da Sangallo the Younger had built for Francesco Orsini in order to erect his own from the ground up.Palazzo Braschi Construction was suspended in February 1798 during the Napoleonic occupation of the city, when the French temporarily took possession of it until 1802 and confiscated the recently acquired collection of antiquities it contained (though Braschi was reimbursed for them). In 1809, when Rome was declared an Imperial city by Napoleon, Duke Luigi moved into the palace and was declared mayor. On his death in 1816 the palace remained unfinished and the family funds depleted. In 1871 the Braschi Onesti heirs sold the building to the Italian State, who made it the seat of the Ministry of Interior (now moved into Palazzo del Viminale). During the Italian fascist period, it was used as the political headquarters of Benito Mussolini, and was adorned with a giant sculpture of the dictator's face. After the war, it housed 300 refugee families and many of the interior frescoes were seriously damaged by the fires they lit to keep warm. In 1949 the palace passed to the civic authorities and, following extensive conservation in 1952, the present installation of the museum was effected. The main entrance is on Via San Pantaleo (between Piazza Navona and Corso Vittorio Emanuele). The oval hall inside the main entrance overlooks Via San Pantaleo, and leads to the monumental staircase with its eighteen red granite columns which came from the gallery built by the Emperor Caligula on the banks of the River Tiber. Decorating the staircase there are ancient sculptures and fine stuccoes by Luigi Acquisti inspired by the myth of Achilles. On the piazza at the Southwest corner of the palace is the statue of Pasquino. The infamous Mussolini facade, 1934. The \\"SI\\" (Italian for \\"yes\\") refers to the 1934 Italian general election, which was a simple yes-no vote on the Fascist Party list. The Neoclassical architect Giuseppe Valadier designed the chapel on the piano nobile or first floor. He also designed the white marble facade on the adjacent church of San Pantaleo for which is named the piazza in front of the Palazzo Braschi.

It presently covers all of Washington and Jefferson counties, most of Waukesha County, and portions of Dodge, Milwaukee and Walworth counties. It is currently represented by Republican Jim Sensenbrenner, who is not running for re-election in 2020. This is the most Republican district in Wisconsin. George W. Bush carried the district in 2004 with 63% of the vote. The 5th District was the only district in Wisconsin that John McCain won in 2008, giving 57.73% of the vote to McCain and 41.28% to Barack Obama. Prior to the 2000 census (when Wisconsin lost a seat in Congress), the 5th District was a Milwaukee district, with vastly different boundaries and political history, represented often by Democrats or even Socialists. Most of the territory now in the 5th was part of the 9th District from 1965 to 2003. At that time, all of Milwaukee was merged into the 4th District, while the old 9th essentially became the new 5th.

Biography Giuseppe Lazzarotto was born in Carpan√®, Vicenza, Italy, on 24 May 1942. He studied for the priesthood and was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Padua on 1 April 1967. He completed the program of study at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1967 and earned a doctorate in canon law. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1971. Lazzarotto served as part of the delegations in Zambia and Malawi, Belgium, Cuba, and Jerusalem, and in the Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State of the Holy See from 1984 to 1994. He was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and to Iraq on 23 July 1994 and appointed Titular Archbishop of Numana. He was consecrated bishop on 7 October 1994 by Cardinal Angelo Sodano assisted by Archbishop Miroslav Stefan Marusyn and Bishop Antonio Mattiazzo. He was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland on 11 November 2000. He presented his credentials to President Mary McAleese on 18 January 2001. In 2007 a questionnaire about prospective candidates for bishop that Lazzarotto had sent to priests in the Down and Connor Diocese became public. Lazzarotto refused to comment about it saying that \\"all aspects relating to the process of episcopal appointments should be dealt with in the strictest confidentiality. I trust that you will understand that I cannot depart from this practice\\". On 22 December 2007, Pope Benedict XVI named him Apostolic Nuncio to Australia. The Murphy Report into child abuse in the Dublin archdiocese, released in November 2009, criticized Lazzarotto for failing to respond to a request for documents. His refusal was part of an ongoing dispute between the Irish investigators and the Holy See. The Vatican insisted on communication through the Irish Ministry of Foreign Affairs while the Commission viewed itself as independent of the government and not confined to diplomatic channels. On 18 August 2012, Pope Benedict appointed him apostolic nuncio to Israel and apostolic delegate to Jerusalem and Palestine, to which he added the responsibilities of apostolic nuncio to Cyprus on 30 August. He retired from the diplomatic service in August 2017. On 4 October, Pope Francis named him a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. At the end of 2017, he was appointed Assessor of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre by its Grand Master, Cardinal Edwin O'Brien. He resigned that position for health reasons in 2019.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 5 May 1994\\\\. Deckert was given the role of Selina after her third audition for the show. In 1996, Deckert fell ill and Louise Crawford played Selina in her absence. In 1997, Deckert decided to leave the serial, however briefly returned in 1998. Her return was filmed in Ironbridge, Shropshire, as part of the serial's first ever overseas location filming. Selina's last appearance to date was on 30 March 1998, where she agreed to marry Steven. Selina was introduced to the show after she developed a crush on her teacher. Selina was portrayed as a tearaway, who had a reputation for being the \\"town tramp.\\" She often went off the rails, due to arguments with her parents, but she was a good person deep inside. Inside Soap described her as a \\"tart with a heart who's simply misunderstood.\\" Selina was also a tomboy who regularly dressed in tartan shirts and Doc Martens. Deckert revealed that Selina was supposed to be a clich√©d bimbo, so she decided to introduce biker boots to the wardrobe department. Selina later decides to clean up her act and she begins dating Jack Wilson, who she believes is her soul mate. Selina has been central to many \\"bizarre\\" storylines such as having a miscarriage at school, being sexually harassed, stalked and entering a relationship with her school teacher Steven Matheson. The character has received mixed reviews from critics. Deckert earned a nomination for \\"Most Popular Actress\\" at the Logie Awards, for her portrayal of Selina. Casting Deckert auditioned for Home and Away three times in Melbourne. Following her third audition, she was asked to fly to Sydney for a screen test and was told she had the part of Selina. She was asked to return the following day to begin filming and Deckert had to leave her school in order to join the show. In 1996, Deckert fell ill and actress Louise Crawford played Selina during Deckert's temporary absence. In mid-1997, speculation grew around Deckert and whether she had quit the serial, though the Home and Away publicity department did not confirm nor deny her departure. However, Deckert did leave the serial in 1997. She made a brief return to filming in 1998. Character development Upon her arrival, Selina was described as being a tearaway with an attitude. Selina also had a reputation for being the \\"town tramp\\" and Deckert explained that while it was a pretty true description, it was not exactly Selina's fault. She said \\"She's a good person deep down even if she is a bit of a slut.\\" Selina had lived in the Bay with her family all her life. She and her parents spent their time arguing rather than discussing their problems, which led to Selina going off the rails. Deckert told Inside Soap that the reason for Selina's introduction was her crush on teacher Luke Cunningham (John Adam). Selina chases after Luke at the debutante ball, but Luke is not interested in her. Her attempts to seduce him, makes her a household name and reputation falls even further. Selina decides to clean up her act following the fiasco with Luke and she turns out to be a \\"tart with a heart who's simply misunderstood.\\" Selina begins dating fellow wild child Jack Wilson (Daniel Amalm) and Deckert said that the relationship allowed her to portray Selina's softer side. Of this, she said \\"It comes as a big surprise to Selina when she realises that she really does like Jack. She's used to chasing anything in trousers! In fact, she finds herself falling in love, especially when she discovers Jack doesn't have any parents - she warms to him and sees him as a real soul mate.\\" While interviewed by the Daily Mirror Deckert said \\"Selina has always been into boys, in fact, they're her only real interest.\\" Selina regularly dressed in leather jackets, tartan shirts and Doc Martens. Victoria Ross of Inside Soap opined that Selina had a \\"passion for dodgy fashion\\" and was not likely to blend into the background. Deckert said her character was not supposed to be a \\"real grunge chick\\" and explained that Selina was going to be a clich√©d bimbo. The actress introduced the wardrobe department to biker boots and Selina became a real tomboy. Deckert told The Sun-Herald that some viewers were shocked at her real appearance as they thought Selina looked \\"like such a dog\\" in the show. Selina develops a relationship with Curtis Reed (Shane Ammann). Ammann fell ill in real life so producers forced Deckert to have a blood test following kissing scenes. Although it turned out to be minor, changes to filming were made so their characters would not share many kissing scenes. In one storyline Selina discovers she is pregnant after a fling with Damian Roberts (Matt Doran). Deckert said it was a hard storyline and she was shocked because she had no idea what would happen to Selina. When producers informed her that Selina would miscarry, she was happy she would not have to act the birth scenes out. Selina miscarries in the school corridor and Deckert said it was a surprising element, but disliked having twenty extras watching her perform. Deckert later told a reporter from What's on TV that \\"she's always been a failure, but being a mum was something she was determined to do well.\\" Selina had a complicated relationship with her teacher Steven Matheson (Adam Willits). Their romance was rocky and it took many \\"twists\\" throughout its progression. Selina left Steven on their wedding day. Deckert said it was a typical soap wedding with plenty of mishaps along the way. A conclusion to their storyline and Deckert's final appearance to date, was filmed in Ironbridge, Shropshire. This was the first occasion the serial had filmed an episode overseas. The storyline saw Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) arrive to help Selina recover from malaria. She also reunited Selina with Steven, who arrived pledging his love for her. Storylines Selina develops a crush on her teacher Luke Cunningham and is known for an allegedly promiscuous nature. Jack Wilson is attracted to her and they begin dating and attend the school formal together. While sharing a kiss at the dance, they accidentally end up tipping paint over principal Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) and his date Irene. Selina's mother, Dawn (Kim Deacon) tells her they are moving away. Selina offers to sleep with Jack before she leaves, but he tells her she does not have to. Several weeks later, Selina runs away and asks Irene to take her in. Irene cannot officially foster her but the Department of Child Care Services agree she can stay with Irene. Selina discovers that Jack is already dating another girl, Sonia Johnson (Eva Matuik) and punches him. Selina and Jack later resume their relationship but Jack continues to see Sonia and also begins dating Frankie Brooks (Lenka Kripac). When the girls discover Jack's three-timing, they concoct a revenge plan which leaves Jack humiliated in the caravan park but nothing but his boxers. Selina begins looking for a new boyfriend and sets her sights on Curtis. Shannon (Isla Fisher), Curtis' adopted sister and girlfriend is annoyed and this and they fight at a party. Rob Storey (Matthew Lilley) turns a hose on them in order to break it up. Selina backs off and she and Shannon become good friends. Selina briefly dates Irene's nephew, Nelson McFarlane (Laurence Bruels). Irene's son Damian arrives for Shane Parrish (Dieter Brummer) and Angel Brooks' (Melissa George) wedding and Selina is attracted to him. They sleep together and Selina later discovers she is pregnant. Neither are ready for parenthood, so Selina decides to put the baby up for adoption and call her Maddie upon birth. However, Selina later suffers a miscarriage. Curtis and Selina begin dating. On a school trip, Selina stops classmate Joe Lynch (Justin Rosniak) from running away after a bullying incident but this results in Donald finding her with Joe, Jack and Curtis in the boys' dorm. Donald cancels the trip and Selina exacerbates the situation by arguing with him. He tries to unsuccessfully have her expelled and is forced to reinstate her. Selina is later elected school captain and changes her name by deed poll to Roberts. Irene reconciles with her estranged husband, Murdoch (Tom Richards), he begins sexually harassing Selina. Irene discovers the truth and throws Murdoch out. After Murdoch's body is found after a bushfire, Irene and Selina find themselves suspects for his murder but are cleared. Selina has a near-death experience when she is stung in the throat by a bee and has strange visions, including her baby crying and a prophetic projection of Steven and Brian \\"Dodge\\" Forbes (Kelly Dingwall) fighting and falling over a cliff ledge. Selina later ends things with Curtis after this incident, because Curtis found her story to be too unbelievable. Saul Bennett (David Ritchie) becomes obsessed with her and tells her if she has a child with him Maddie would be reincarnated. Irene, Shannon and Alex Bennett (Nick Freedman) all try to prevent her from being brainwashed by Saul. She eventually comes to her senses which results in Saul kidnapping her until Alex saves her. When Selina finds an abandoned baby called Millie on the beach, she is convinced it is fate.

Reception For her portrayal of Selina, Deckert was nominated for \\"Most Popular Actress\\" at the 1997 Logie Awards. Later that year she was nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" at the Inside Soap Awards. Deckert said many viewers felt sorry for Selina because of all the trauma she had faced in her life. She added that she had done some of the \\"weirdest\\" acting thanks to Selina's \\"bizarre life.\\" Dave Lanning writing for The People questioned whether Australia had child welfare when \\"slinky Selina\\" found a baby on the beach and kept it. The Birmingham Post said Selina being kidnapped on her wedding day was a \\"bizarre storyline.\\" The Newcastle Herald included the 1998 episode of Home and Away, in which Selina and Steven returned in their \\"TV Highlights\\" feature. Simon Hughes writing for The Age said the serial was like a \\"pedophile's paradise\\" and that Selina's storyline with Murdoch highlighted this. He opined that Selina's predicament should not be underestimated, and observed Selina as being a \\"typical adolescent\\" because she \\"rolls her eyes, sneers and pouts and purses her lips.\\" He concluded that Home and Away's make-up department made her look like a \\"Puerto Rican whore in a school dress.\\" In Dr. Glyn Davis and Kay Dickinson's book Teen TV: genre, consumption, identity, they said teenage oriented television in the 1990s portrayed many characters appearing to snub university, using Selina as one of their examples.

Although Edgeworth is known for having her novels (Castle Rackrent, The Absentee) address issues of nationalism in an Anglo-Irish context, Leonora instead privileges English manners over French ones. The plot of the novel centers on the newly married Leonora and her decision to bring back to England a woman who had been exiled to France. The woman, Olivia, is known as a \\"coquette,\\" and her controversial behavior with regard to her marriage had driven her to France, where she cultivated an aristocratic, \\"French\\" sensibility that exists apart from conventional morality. The novel is written in an epistolary style, which means all of the action is mediated through personal letters and the letter-writers' points-of-view. By having the main characters tell the story through their own perspectives, the reader gets to read full articulations of competing sensibilities and philosophies, although the narrative clearly prefers Leonora's prudent reserve over Olivia's extravagant emotional displays. Indeed, this novel can be read as a critique of Sensibility, a behavioral phenomenon that tries to correlate a person's emotional sensitivity with her elevated moral sentiments. Olivia, a self-professed woman of Sensibility, often makes dramatic displays of feeling that are described by others as \\"theatrical,\\" or contrived, and in her personal correspondence with her French friend, Gabrielle, Olivia makes grand claims about sentiment and love that, conveniently, justify her insatiable need for attention, particularly male attention. While a conventional reading of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility dismisses the heroine Marianne's Sensibility as romantic teenage folly, Edgeworth's novel Leonora emphasizes Olivia's behavior as hypocritical narcissism. Maria Edgeworth's letter to Mrs. Pruxton at Black Castle, Navan, dated 8 June 1806, reads: \\"------ Lady Olivia in ' Leonora ' is now supposed by all Dublin to be a portrait of Lady Asgill [wife of Sir Charles Asgill, 2nd Baronet] and that wherever they go they have to defend me by asserting that I'm not acquainted with the said Lady Asgill. Very luckily I never did meet her at Lady Holt's where she was intimate. She was educated by Mademoiselle Le Noir who was Miss Bracebridge's governess and who was more like Mademoiselle Panache than Lady Asgill is - to Olivia - at all events this fancy of the Dublin fine world promotes the sale of the book and I am content. -------.\\" Lady Bessborough, writing to Granville Leveson Gower from Paris on Thursday, 23 December 1802, had this to say about Maria Edgeworth: \\"‚Ä¶..I was introduc'd by him [Fran√ßois de la Harpe] to the famous Miss Edgeworth and her Brother (Castle Rackrent &c.; By the by, I am sure she wrote it all herself, for the brother seems a fool and a coxcomb; she very ugly, but delightful.)\\" ReferencesExternal links * 1806 British novels Epistolary novels Novels by Maria Edgeworth Novels about nationalism 19th-century Irish novels ","title":"Leonora (novel)"},{"id":"6319632","text":"Second Noah is a television drama that was broadcast in the United States on ABC television from February 5, 1996 to June 8, 1997. Premise The series stars Daniel Hugh Kelly as Noah Beckett, whose wife Jesse (Betsy Brantley) is a veterinarian at Busch Gardens in Florida. Noah is a former basketball coach who is now a writer working on a second book, to be titled The Ark, after his first effort has sold over 2,000,000 copies. Noah and Jesse have a tendency to take in both stray animals and stray children, having adopted eight. The iguana star in the series and on the cover of the book is Peepers Saccardo. After Peeper's death, he is forever immortalized by taxidermy and sits proudly in front of the owner's fireplace.

He had fathered a child, Ben (Gemini Barnett), when he was fourteen with his girlfriend Kaylie. Noah and Jesse adopted Ben. Kaylie, daughter of a wealthy family, left town during her pregnancy and did not return until after Ben's birth; Kaylie's own father is not aware that she has ever been pregnant or had a child. Ricky and Kaylie were not together for most of the series. Instead, Ricky was with Darby, played by Joey Lauren Adams. The series pilot tells the story of how the Becketts came to adopt children #7 and 8, Roxanna and Luis. Starting with the first non-pilot episode of the show, Roxanna and Luis are played by different actors, Erika Page and Jeffrey Licon respectively. Roxanna is not immediately accepted at her new high school and she and Ricky develop a friendship as he tries to stand up for her. Luis is a chronic liar who tells everyone that Julio Iglesias is his father. Ranny and Danny, played by Jon and Jeremy Torgerson, are twins a little younger than Ricky and Roxanna. They have also been adopted by the Becketts for the longest. Ranny is more of a \\"bad boy\\" who searches for his birth parents. Danny is quieter and shy. Bethany (Zelda Harris - although RuDee Sade played the role of Bethany in the pilot episode) and Hannah (Ashley Gorrell) are the same age but Hannah was adopted later. They are very close to each other and this is highlighted by the fact that Hannah rarely speaks outside of the family and Bethany must speak for her in various situations. Hannah's mother kept her locked in a closet with little human contact prior to her adoption by the Becketts and she continues to seek comfort by hiding in closets during stressful situations. Later in the series, a man is introduced whom Bethany believes to be her father, though the show remains ambiguous on the truth of that claim. It is worthwhile to note that Bethany is Black and Hannah is White and racial tensions are often explored around these characters. In the pilot, the Becketts find a housekeeper, Shirley (Deidre O'Connell), who becomes part of the family. Her son, JoJo (Michael McLafferty), appears in town at some point and we learn that he used to be a drug addict and that Shirley blames him for the death of her other son, Robbie (Russell Breslow). Shirley believed that Robbie got the drugs that killed him from JoJo. There is a romance between Roxanna and Shirley's son in four episodes, \\"The Big Hurt\\"; \\"Faith Hope and Charity\\"; \\"Slings and Arrows\\"; and \\"The Choice\\". Order of adoption According to various conversations throughout episodes, the order of the children's adoption is as follows: In episode 9, \\"The Big Chief\\", when Jesse explained to her father why she and Noah had no biological children, she mentioned how, when on a romantic getaway in New Orleans they saw \\"a newspaper article about two twins whose mother had abandoned them\\", which means that both Ranny and Danny were the first to be adopted. In episode 7, \\"Ghost Story\\", Noah and Jesse reminisce on how they adopted Bethany at \\"two and a half years old\\", when they saw her \\"singing for her supper on the corner of Brighten and Broadway\\" in Tampa. Since Ranny and Danny are only two years older than Bethany, it is clear that Bethany was adopted second. It is vague as to when they adopted Ricky and Hannah, because there is no direct quote explaining it. We know that Ricky fathered Ben at fourteen which was some while after he, himself was adopted. As far as Hannah is concerned, we know that she was adopted at least a year or two before her appearance in the pilot, because of her close relationship with Bethany. After Ben was born, we were told in episode 19 (\\"Heart Matters\\") that Jesse and Noah picked him up from the adoption agency in Boston right after he was born. The reason he was born in Boston is because Kaylie was sent there to boarding school. She did not return for four years, namely the episode \\"Heart Matters.\\" Luis and Roxanna were the last to be adopted. Luis was first, since in the pilot, Jesse and Noah were still trying to find Roxanna. Therefore, the adoption order is as follows: *1. Ranny (Randolph Samson) *2. Danny (Daniel Samson) (as told in episode three, \\"Close Encounters\\") *3. Bethany *4. Ricky (or Hannah) *5. Hannah (or Ricky) *6. Ben *7. Luis *8. Roxanna Animals Many animals have had major roles in various episodes. In episode 2, \\"Hoops and Dreams\\", Jesse took care of a monkey named \\"Caesar\\" after his mother, \\"Chloe\\" had died. In episode 4, \\"Stormy Weather\\", an alligator came into the house through a dog door during Hurricane Betsy. There was also another alligator who almost attacked Luis when he was trying to find their pet pig, Homer. In episode 10, a grey parrot, was found and Jesse brought it home to be Ben's pet. In episode 11, \\"A Dog's Life\\", Ricky saves an abused dog (Buddy) from his owner. In episode 17, \\"Slings and Arrows\\", Jesse is concerned about two rhinos who, like herself at one point, had trouble conceiving. Jesse's pregnancy In episode 14, it was revealed the Jessie, who was suffering from a \\"mysterious ailment\\" in the previous episode (\\"Fly Like a Bird\\"), was finally pregnant at 41 years of age. She revealed that the conception took place when both she and Noah visited New Orleans in episode 4, \\"Stormy Weather.\\" This pregnancy was a major change in the series, because the basic premise for why Jesse and Noah adopted so many children was because of her infertility. At the news of the pregnancy, several people in the house were upset. Bethany was worried that she would become an outcast because of her skin color, asking Jesse during a private moment, \\"It's gonna look like you, isn't it?\\". Ricky was upset, because he figured Noah and Jesse would begin to treat all of them differently. He knew for himself how it felt to biologically father a child, and he was certain that there would be a rift within the family when the baby was born. Ben was upset, because he was no longer going to be the youngest. He even went as far as opening all the animal pins, one of which he let out a bull, which trampled Jesse in her attempt to rescue Ben from danger. Luis was upset, because, as Ranny and Danny stated, \\"Luis, have you ever heard of the phrase, 'Last hired, first fired'?\\" Since he and Roxanna were the last to be adopted, he worried that they would get rid of them on the arrival of the baby. Since the child's birth was never seen due to the show's cancellation, there is no definite way to know the baby's sex. Yet, in episode 14, \\"God's Last Laugh\\", Shirley reveals that she, along with the rest of the household, did the \\"hang the needle test, and the needle don't lie.\\" The needle test said that the baby was going to be a girl. Earlier in the episode, Jesse had the same hunch when she came home from the hospital. She is quoted as saying, \\"She's gonna be ok. I know she's gonna be ok...\\" to which Noah replied, \\"She?\\" In the final episode, Jesse feels the baby kick for the first time. Filming location The series pilot episode was actually filmed in its setting of Tampa, Florida in a house near Bayshore Boulevard. The city of Tampa received a million dollars from SN‚Ä≤s production there. After the show was picked up for season one the location was moved to another Floridian style home on a lake on N. Boulevard in North Tampa where it remained until the series demise. Cancellation Second Noah was cancelled in the summer of 1997 due to low ratings. There was controversy, however. ABC and Disney's venture of The Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World was to open in 1998 and executives did not want to promote Busch Gardens in Tampa, since it would be in direct competition to the new zoological park in Kissimmee. The show's final three episodes aired on May 25, 1997; June 1, 1997; and June 8, 1997, and took place at Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. International broadcast In Canada, the series was shown on CHCH, in simulcast with ABC.

This differs from the spoke-hub distribution paradigm in which the transportation goes to a central location where passengers change to another train, bus, or plane to reach their destination. Use in airlines The point-to-point model is used widely by low cost carriers, including Allegiant Air and Southwest Airlines in the U.S., and European carriers such as Ryanair, easyJet and Wizzair. Many such airlines sell each flight leg independently and have no concept of round-trip ticketing or connecting flights so baggage must be collected and rechecked even to transfer between flights booked at the same time on the same airline. Although there are many point-to-point airlines, most have at least a \\"homebase\\" airport where most flights originate or depart. The United States airport system was point-to-point, controlled by CAB, until deregulation late 1960s/early 1970s, and eventually the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act when they switched to the hub concept, until the advent of low-cost carriers, when point-to-point air transport increased. Some full-service network carriers operate the point-to-point model alongside the hub-and-spoke system for certain high-density routes between focus cities. In Europe, for example, most traditional full-service airlines operate seasonal point-to-point service outside their hubs to serve Mediterranean and Alpine holiday resorts. Advantages * It eliminates the need for connections. * It considerably reduces travel time. * It considerably reduces risk of baggage loss or baggage arriving much later than the passenger, as baggage is not transferred as fast as passengers. * Total fuel and pollution per passenger is lower: a passenger flying directly from Brussels to San Francisco will burn less fuel than flying via London or New York. * Without the need to satisfy connections for passengers, trips in a point-to-point system are less interdependent, but the operational constraints of needing to have sufficient equipment and personnel in each location at the right time to satisfy the timetable remain. That minimizes the risk of the domino effect in which the delayed arrival of one trip into a place leads to delayed departures of the (often) multiple trips with which its passengers had to make connections, cascading delays through the network. Therefore, a point-to-point system is less prone to delays. * It has proven advantageous in the air cargo industry in which freight is carried in the unused baggage hold space on passenger flights (\\"belly cargo\\"). Traditionally, large cargo aircraft are scheduled to fly between large hubs so freight often has to be forwarded on by additional flights or by rail or road. Belly cargo carried point to point can be delivered closer to its final destination. Disadvantages * If a desired origin‚Äìdestination pair is not served, passengers will have to make a connection as in the hub model or travel by another mode of transportation. Low-cost carriers typically do not facilitate or honor connections, even if the consecutive flights are operated by that carrier and arrive and depart from the same airport. * The frequency of trips may be reduced because the number of origin‚Äìdestination pairs is orders of magnitude larger.

Shafiq was the highest-ranking military officer in the Pahlavi family. He worked in the navy of Iran from 1963 to 1979. He served as the commander of the Persian Gulf fleet of Hovercraft before the 1979 revolution. Additionally, Shafiq was the head of Judo and Karate federation of Iran during the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah. Later years and assassination After the revolution of February 1979, he was the only member of the Pahlavi dynasty who stayed in Iran and kept fighting against the revolutionaries, up to the point when he had to flee in a small boat from the Persian Gulf to Kuwait, under heavy fire. He fled Iran in March 1979. After leaving Iran, Shafiq first went to the United States. Then he joined his family in Paris, France, on 14 November 1979, and began organizing a resistance movement against the Islamic Republic. He founded the group, Iran Azad (Free Iran), which was later led by his sister Azadeh with whom he was living in Paris. They both acted as the Pahlavi family‚Äôs principal spokesmen. In Iran, Islamic judge Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali tried and sentenced him and other members of the Pahlavi family in absentia to death in a secret trial in the spring of 1979. He was assassinated in Paris on 7 December 1979, being shot twice in the head by agents of the Islamic Republic on the Rue Pergolese, outside his mother's home. He was aged 34. The attack was carried out by a masked gunman. Ayatollah Khalkhali claimed that the assassination was carried out by one of his death squads and therefore, Shafiq was the first victim of Iran's death squads. The Muslim Liberation Group announced that it was responsible for the assassination. Shahriar's body was not buried, but embalmed and moved to New York where it was kept by his mother.

Her work, using a wide variety of media including sculpture, print, performance art, music, and others, explores the power of language and the mystical nature of the psyche. Dill currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Early life and education Dill was born in 1950 to high school teachers, and was raised in Maine. The natural landscape in Maine served as an inspiration for her work and its impact can be found in several pieces, including the installation piece SHIMMER (2005-2006). Dill received a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1972 from Trinity College and went on to receive a Master of Arts in Teaching from Smith College in 1974. After a period of teaching in public and private schools, Dill went on to receive a Master of Fine Arts from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 1980. It wasn't until her late twenties that Dill began to consider a career as an artist. Growing up, she was an avid reader, and her fascination with language can be found in her art. Before pursuing a career in art, Dill's exposure to art was mostly limited to the crafts practiced by various family members, including ceramics, linocut printing, rug making, and weaving. As a result, some craft practices can be found in her art. In 1985, Dill married filmmaker Ed Robbins, and their life together has played a role in shaping her work, especially in the places they traveled together. Artistic career and style In the eighties, Dill began working in sculpture, creating both wood and cast bronze sculptures. A gift of Emily Dickinson poems in 1990 proved to be important to the development of Dill's style, as she began to work the text of poems directly into her pieces, something that she has continued throughout her career with the works of a variety of poets, including Emily Dickinson, Pablo Neruda, and Salvador Espiru. Another major influence on Dill's work is the time she spent living and working in India with her husband. There she was impacted by the landscape, weather, architecture, clothing, and other sensory aspects of her environment. Her decision to experiment with painting text on human models and photographing these \\"living sculptures\\" was inspired by watching Indian women creating henna designs. Her forays into photography transitioned into working in performance art, with pieces like Speaking Dress (1994). She explores the relationship of text and language to a variety of media, often employing a diverse range of materials.Brooklyn.orgArtspace.com Voices in My Head from 1997, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, demonstrates how the artist combines photography with text, embellishing the work with charcoal and thread. Dill has described language as being \\"...the touchstone, the pivot point of all my work.\\"Quoted on the exhibition website at the Hunter Museum of American Art, http://www.smith.edu/artmuseum/exhibitions/dill/ Her work crosses traditional boundaries between artistic disciplines and includes printmaking, drawing, sculpture, photography and performance art, often used in tandem with one another. Community projects and performances In the 1990s, Dill began a project with Graphicstudio/USF in Tampa, Florida, through which she created several large-scale pieces which were hung as billboards around the city. The billboards reached a broader audience, including many who may not visit traditional museum or gallery settings. In addition to her sculpture and works on paper, Dill is known for her performance work and public projects. In 2000, the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, Winston-Salem presented Lesley Dill, Tongues on Fire: Visions and Ecstasy, the artist's first community-based project, which included a performance done in collaboration with the Emmanuel Baptist Church Spiritual Choir. In 2003, Dill's performance project I Heard a Voice, done in collaboration with Tom Morgan and the Ars Nova Singers, was presented at the Evergreen Cultural Centre (Vancouver). It included the world premiere of the performance piece I Dismantle. Music In 2008, Dill conceived and directed a full-scale opera, Divide Light, based on the language of Emily Dickinson. It premiered in August 2008 at the Montalvo Arts Center, Saratoga, California.Divide Light, Montalvo Arts Center, Saratoga, CA., http://montalvoarts.org/programs/divide_light/ The opera was commissioned by Montalvo Arts Center and was supported in part by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation Multi Arts Production Fund, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. A film of the opera, Divide Light, premiered in New York City at the Anthology Film Archives in April 2009. The music was done in collaboration with composer Richard Marriott. In 2012, Dill began collaborating with Pamela Ordo√±ez on Drunk with the Starry Void, a multimedia musical performance. It premiered in the summer of 2015 at the McNay Museum in San Antonio. In April 2018, Divide Light was re-performed at Dixon Place in New York City by the New Camerata Opera.

History and definition The concept of moment form, and the specific term, originated with the composition Kontakte (1958‚Äì60) by Karlheinz Stockhausen (; ). A \\"moment\\", in Stockhausen's terminology, is any \\"formal unit in a particular composition that is recognizable by a personal and unmistakable character.\\" It can be either an indivisible gestalt, a structure with clear components, or a mixture of the two; and it can be static, or dynamic, or a combination of the two. \\"Depending on their characteristics, they can be as long or as short as you like\\" . \\"Moment forming\\", on the other hand, is a compositional approach in which a narrative overall line is deliberately avoided. The component moments in such a form are related by a nonlinear principle of proportions. If this system of proportions exhausts a set of possibilities, the form is said to be \\"closed\\"; if not, or if the series of proportions is not finite, then the form is \\"open\\". Moment form does not necessarily avoid perceptible goal-directed processes. \\"They simply refuse to participate in a globally directed narrative curve, which is, naturally, not their purpose\\" . In Stockhausen's words, works with this property > neither aim at the climax, nor at prepared (and consequently expected) > multiple climaxes, and the usual introductory, rising, transitional and > fading-away stages are not delineated in a development curve encompassing > the entire duration of the work. On the contrary, these forms are > immediately intense and seek to maintain the level of continued \\"main > points\\", which are constantly equally present, right up until they stop. In > these forms a minimum or a maximum may be expected in every moment, and no > developmental direction can be predicted with certainty from the present > one; they have always already commenced, and could continue forever; in them > either everything present counts, or nothing at all; and each and every Now > is not unremittingly regarded as the mere consequence of the one which > preceded it and as the upbeat to the coming one‚Äîin which one puts one's > hope‚Äîbut rather as something personal, independent and centred, capable of > existing on its own. They are forms in which an instant does not have to be > just a bit of a temporal line, nor a moment just a particle of a measured > duration, but rather in which concentration on the Now‚Äîon every Now‚Äîmakes > vertical slices, as it were, that cut through a horizontal temporal > conception to a timelessness I call eternity: an eternity that does not > begin at the end of time but is attainable in every moment. I am speaking of > musical forms in which apparently nothing less is being attempted than to > explode (even to overthrow) the temporal concept‚Äîor, put more accurately: > the concept of duration. . . . > In works of this kind the start and stop are open and yet they cease after > a certain duration. Representative works Besides Kontakte, works cited by Stockhausen as being particularly concerned with moment forming include the earlier Gesang der J√ºnglinge (1955‚Äì56), as well as the subsequent Carr√© (1960), Momente (1962‚Äì64/69), Mixtur (1964), Mikrophonie I (1964), Mikrophonie II (1965), Telemusik (1966), Hymnen (1966‚Äì67/69), Stimmung (1968), Samstag aus Licht (1981‚Äì83), Michaelion from Mittwoch aus Licht, Himmelfahrt (2004‚Äì05), Freude (2005), and Himmels-T√ºr (2005) (; ; ; ; ). The concept of moment form has often been confused with mobile (or, in Stockhausen's nomenclature, \\"polyvalent\\") forms, because in four of these compositions (Momente, Mixtur, Mikrophonie I, and Stimmung), the component moments can be ordered in different ways. Several other works by Stockhausen have this \\"mobile\\" feature, without falling into his category of moment form, for example, Klavierst√ºck XI (1956), Refrain (1959), Zyklus (1959), and Sirius (1975‚Äì77). Certain works by other composers, both earlier and contemporaneous, such as Istv√°n Anhalt, Earle Brown, Elliott Carter, Barney Childs, Roberto Gerhard, Michael Gielen, Hans Werner Henze, Charles Ives, Witold Lutos≈Çawski, Olivier Messiaen, Morgan Powell, Roger Reynolds, Joseph Schwantner, Roger Sessions, Igor Stravinsky, Anton Webern, Stefan Wolpe, Yehuda Yannay, and Frank Zappa, have also been cited as instances of moment form (; ; ; ).

Railway  In 1873, the Ross and Monmouth Railway line from Ross-on-Wye station to Monmouth Troy was built. It crossed the River Wye at Kerne Bridge on a single-track skew bridge constructed of plate girders. The single-track bridge was built by Edward Finch of Chepstow and was long. Kerne Bridge railway station was the first initially station after leaving Ross-on-Wye, though Walford Halt at Walford was built later between them. The station closed in 1959 when passenger service on the line was withdrawn. Goods services continued to run until 1964, when the bridge was demolished, leaving the masonry abutments.

He specializes in literature, politics and historiography in the early modern period, and in early modern women's writing. He is currently writing a biography and edition of Lucy Hutchinson. He teaches in literary theory and early modern texts, in early modern women writers, and in Shakespeare, Milton and Marvell. Before his current role, he taught at the University of Maryland. Norbrook was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School, the University of Aberdeen and Balliol College, Oxford. He became fellow and tutor in English Language and Literature at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1978, and offered some support to the radical pressure group Oxford English Limited in the late 1980s. He is the author of Poetry and Politics in the English Renaissance, Writing the English Republic: Poetry, Rhetoric and Politics, 1627-1660, and The Penguin Book of Renaissance Verse. Academic studies Professor Norbrook's historiographical studies of Renaissance English Literature explain the poetry, drama and prose writings of the period 1509-1659 in the political context of the period. Renaissance English poetry was closely involved with affairs of state: some poets held high office, others wrote to influence those in power and to sway an increasingly independent public opinion. In Poetry and Politics in the English Renaissance, Norbrook explains the political context and events that influenced writers such as Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, Ben Jonson, and John Milton. Norbrook's work shares a certain affinity with that of Stephen Greenblatt, although Norbrook is not regarded as a member of the new historicist school.

There are two types; non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with the latter also including liver inflammation. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is less dangerous than NASH and usually does not progress to NASH or liver cirrhosis. When NAFLD does progress to NASH, it may eventually lead to complications such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure, or cardiovascular disease. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are strong risk factors for NAFLD. Other risks include being overweight, metabolic syndrome (defined as at least three of the five following medical conditions: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high serum triglycerides, and low serum HDL cholesterol), a diet high in fructose, and older age. NAFLD and alcoholic liver disease are types of fatty liver disease. Obtaining a sample of the liver after excluding other potential causes of fatty liver can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for NAFLD is weight loss by dietary changes and exercise. There is tentative evidence for pioglitazone and vitamin E; bariatric surgery can improve or resolve severe cases. Those with NASH have a 2.6% increased risk of dying per year. NAFLD is the most common liver disorder worldwide and is present in approximately 25% of the world's population. It is also very common in developed nations, such as the United States, and affected about 75 to 100 million Americans in 2017. Over 90% of obese, 60% of diabetic, and up to 20% normal-weight people develop it. NAFLD is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and the second most common reason for liver transplantation in the US and Europe as of 2017. NAFLD affects about 20 to 25% of people in Europe. In the United States, estimates suggest between 30 and 40% of adults have NAFLD, and about 3 to 12% of adults have NASH. The annual economic burden was approximately US$103 billion in the US in 2016. Definition An abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver in the absence of secondary causes of fatty liver, such as significant alcohol use, viral hepatitis, or medications that can induce fatty liver characterizes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The term NAFLD encompasses a continuum of liver abnormalities, from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL, simple steatosis) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These diseases begin with fatty accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). A liver can remain fatty without disturbing liver function (NAFL), but by various mechanisms and possible insults to the liver, it may also progress into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a state in which steatosis is combined with inflammation and sometimes fibrosis (steatohepatitis). NASH can then lead to complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A new name, metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease, was proposed after 70% of a panel of experts expressed support for this name. Signs and symptoms Overview of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease People with NAFLD often have no noticeable symptoms, and NAFLD is often only detected during routine blood tests or unrelated abdominal imaging or liver biopsy. In some cases, NAFLD can cause symptoms related to liver dysfunction such as fatigue, malaise, and dull right-upper-quadrant abdominal discomfort. Mild yellow discoloration of the skin may occur, although this is rare. NASH can severely impair liver function, leading to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Comorbidities NAFLD is strongly associated with or caused by type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome (defined as at least three of the five following medical conditions: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high serum triglycerides, and low serum high-density lipoprotein). It is also associated with hormonal disorders (panhypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, polycystic ovary syndrome), persistently elevated transaminases, increasing age and hypoxia caused by obstructive sleep apnea, with some of these conditions predicting disease progression. The majority of normal-weight people affected by NAFLD (\\"lean NAFLD\\") have impaired insulin sensitivity, are sedentary, and have increased cardiovascular disease risk and increased liver lipid levels. These are the consequences of a decreased capacity for storing fat and reduced mitochondrial function in adipose tissue and increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Risk factors=Genetics Two-thirds of families with a history of diabetes type 2 report more than one family member having NAFLD. There is a higher risk of fibrosis for family members where someone was diagnosed with NASH. Asian populations are more susceptible to metabolic syndrome and NAFLD than their western counterparts. Hispanic persons have a higher prevalence of NAFLD than white individuals, whereas the lowest prevalence is observed in black individuals. NAFLD is twice as prevalent in men compared to women, which might be explained by lower levels of estrogen in men. Genetic variations in two genes are associated with NAFLD: non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PNPLA3 and TM6SF2. Both correlate with NAFLD presence and severity, but their roles for diagnosis remain unclear. Although NAFLD has a genetic component, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) does not recommend screening family members as there is not enough confirmation of heritability, although there is some evidence from familial aggregation and twin studies. Diet According to the Asia-Pacific Working Group (APWG) on NAFLD, overnutrition is a major factor of NAFLD and NASH, particularly for lean NAFLD. Diet composition and quantity, in particular omega-6 fatty acid and fructose, have important roles in disease progression from NAFL to NASH and fibrosis. Choline deficiency can lead to the development of NAFLD. Pathophysiology The primary characteristic of NAFLD is the accumulation of lipids in the liver, largely in the form of triglycerides. However, the mechanisms by which triglycerides accumulate and the reasons that accumulation can lead to liver dysfunction are complex and incompletely understood. NAFLD can include steatosis along with varied signs of liver injury: either lobular or portal inflammation (a form of liver injury) or ballooning degeneration. Similarly, NASH can include histological features such as portal inflammation, polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates, Mallory bodies, apoptotic bodies, clear vacuolated nuclei, microvesicular steatosis, megamitochondria, and perisinusoidal fibrosis. NASH increases hepatocyte death via apoptosis or necroptosis is increased in NASH compared with simple steatosis, and inflammation is a hallmark of NASH. One debated mechanism proposes that hepatic steatosis progresses to steatosis with inflammation following some further injury, or second hit. Oxidative stress, hormonal imbalances, and mitochondrial abnormalities are potential causes of this \\"second hit\\" phenomenon. A further nutrigenomics model named multiple hit extends the second hit model, suggesting that multiple disease biomarkers and factors such as genes and nutrition influence NAFLD and NASH progression. This model attempts to use these factors to predict the impact of lifestyle changes and genetics for the evolution of the NAFLD pathology. Many researchers describe NAFLD as a multisystem disease, as it impacts and is influenced by organs and regulatory pathways other than the liver. The accumulation of senescent cells in the liver is seen in persons with NAFLD. In mice, liver senescent hepatocytes result in increased liver fat deposition. Treatment of NAFLD mice with senolytic agents has been shown to reduce hepatic steatosis. Fructose consumption Non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver disease share similar histological features, which suggests that they might share common pathogenic pathways. Fructose can cause liver inflammation and addiction similarly to ethanol by using similar metabolic pathways, unlike glucose. Therefore, some researchers argue that non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver diseases are more alike than previously thought. Furthermore, high fructose consumption promotes fat accumulation in the liver by stimulating de novo lipogenesis in the liver and reducing the beta-oxidation of fat. Unlike the sugar glucose, the enzyme fructokinase rapidly metabolizes fructose. This leads to a decreased level of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The decrease in ATP increases oxidative stress and impairments in proper protein synthesis and mitochondrial function in the liver. Insulin resistance Insulin resistance contributes to the accumulation of toxic fat in the liver in several ways. First, it promotes the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from adipose tissue into the blood. Typically, adipose tissue stores lipids in the form of triglycerides, slowly releasing them into the bloodstream when insulin is low. In insulin-resistant adipose tissue, such as in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, more triglycerides are broken down into FFAs and released into the bloodstream, promoting uptake by the liver. Second, insulin promotes the production of new FFAs in the liver via de novo lipogenesis; this production of liver fats continues to be stimulated by insulin, even when other tissues are insulin-resistant. These FFAs are combined back into triglycerides in the liver, forming the major constituent of the accumulated fat in the liver. The three sources of free fatty acids that contribute to liver triglyceride accumulation include FFAs circulating in the bloodstream (59%), FFAs derived from carbohydrates such as fructose and glucose (26%), and diet (14%). Despite the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver, they are not directly toxic to liver tissue. Instead, alteration of the profile of the other lipid subtypes present in the liver, such as diacylglycerols, phospholipids, ceramides, and free cholesterol, have a more significant role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Once NAFLD progresses in severity to the point of NASH, this promotes further insulin resistance in the adipose tissue and liver, which results in a harmful cycle of insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation, and inflammation. Adipose tissue dysfunction also decreases secretion of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin in people with NAFLD. Adiponectin has several properties that protect the liver. These properties include improved liver fat metabolism, decreased de novo lipogenesis, decreased glucose production in the liver, anti-inflammatory properties, and anti-fibrotic properties. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance may also play a role in NAFLD. Insulin-resistant skeletal muscle is not as efficient at taking up glucose from the bloodstream after a meal. This inefficient glucose uptake promotes the redistribution of consumed carbohydrates from glucose destined for use in glycogen stores in the skeletal muscles to being used as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis in the liver. Dysbiosis Disruptions in the intestinal microbiota seem to influence NAFLD risk in several ways. People with NASH can have elevated levels of blood ethanol and proteobacteria (which produce alcohol), with dysbiosis proposed as a mechanism for this elevation. Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota may influence NAFLD risk in several ways. These changes appear to increase the permeability of intestinal tissue, thereby facilitating increased liver exposure to harmful substances (e.g., translocated bacteria, bacterial toxins, and inflammatory chemical signals). The increased transport of these harmful substances to the liver promotes liver inflammation, enhances nutrient and calorie absorption, and alters choline metabolism. Higher levels of intestinal bacteria that produce butyrate may be protective. Excessive macronutrient intake contributes to gut inflammation and perturbation of homeostasis, and micronutrients may also be involved. In addition to reducing weight and risk factors, lifestyle changes may prompt positive changes in the gut microbiota. In particular, diet diversity may play a role that was overlooked in animal studies, since they often compare a Western high-fat, low-diversity diet against a low-fat but higher-diversity chow. The health benefits after bariatric surgery may also involve changes in the gut microbiota by increasing gut permeability.

If any of these factors are observed, an investigation into alternative causes of fatty liver unrelated to NAFLD is recommended. A history of chronic alcohol usage is an important consideration. NAFLD comprises two histological categories: NAFL, and the more aggressive form NASH. The presence of at least 5% fatty liver is common to both NAFL and NASH, but the features of substantial lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injuries such as ballooning or Mallory hyaline only occur in NASH. The majority of NAFL cases show minimal or no inflammation. Pericentral and perisinusoidal fibrosis occur more often in adult-onset NASH, whereas portal fibrosis is more common in children with the disorder. NASH represents a more advanced stage of NAFL and is associated with poor outcomes such as cardiovascular events, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. ICD-11 does not use the term NAFL as it was deemed confusing with the family of disorders NAFLD. The preferred descriptions are instead: NAFLD without NASH or simple steatosis and \\"NASH\\". Also, the modifier with or without fibrosis or cirrhosis completes the diagnostic description. Blood tests Elevated liver enzymes are common. According to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, it is disadvised to test enzymes levels to rule out NAFLD, as they are often within the normal range even in advanced disease. Blood tests that are useful to confirm diagnosis or rule out others include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, glucose, albumin, and kidney function. Because the liver is important for making proteins used in blood clotting, coagulation-related studies are often carried out, especially the INR (international normalized ratio). In people with fatty liver with associated inflammatory injury (steatohepatitis) blood tests are usually used to rule out viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C and herpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus), rubella, and autoimmune diseases. Low thyroid activity is more prevalent in people with NASH, which would be detected by determining the thyroid-stimulating hormone. Some biomarker-based blood tests have been developed and may be useful for diagnosis. Although blood tests cannot diagnose NAFLD, circulating serum biomarkers of liver fibrosis can give moderate estimates in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The ratio of the transaminase liver enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelets in the blood, known as the AST/platelet ratio index (APRI score), and Fibrotest are recommended as the preferred noninvasive tests for cirrhosis by the Asian-Pacific Association for Study of the Liver (APASL). Several other scores such as FIB-4 score and NAFLD fibrosis score can also reflect the burden of the fibrosis in the liver, and previous studies have confirmed that these score can predict future development of mortality and liver cancer. Imaging MRI of a healthy liver (top row) and one with severe steatosis (bottom row) A liver ultrasound scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can diagnose steatosis, but not fibrosis and confirmation of early cirrhosis detection by ultrasound by other diagnostic methods is recommended. The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommends screening for steatosis whenever NAFLD is suspected as this is a strong predictor of the disease evolution and predicts future type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular events, and hypertension. These non-invasive methods can be used for NAFLD screening but are not accepted as a substitute for liver biopsy in NAFLD nor NASH clinical trials, as only a liver biopsy can define liver pathology. CT scans and MRIs are more accurate in detecting cirrhosis than conventional ultrasound. Transient elastography is recommended for the initial assessment of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis and helps to predict complications and prognosis, but the interpretation of results is carefully weighed in the presence of limiting factors, such as steatosis, high BMI, lower degrees of hepatic fibrosis and narrow spaces between the ribs (intercostal spaces). However, transient elastography can fail for people with pre-hepatic portal hypertension. Transient elastography is not considered to be a replacement for liver biopsy. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is an emerging method that can accurately assess hepatic fibrosis and is recommended by the APASL. MRE possesses a good sensitivity to quantify hepatic fat and excellent accuracy to detect fibrosis in NAFLD regardless of BMI and inflammation and is suggested as a more reliable alternative to diagnose NAFLD and its progression to NASH compared to ultrasound and blood tests. Liver biopsy biopsy, which is then examined under a microscope Micrograph of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, demonstrating marked steatosis (fat in liver cells appears white; connective tissue, blue). Trichrome stain A liver biopsy (tissue examination) is the only test widely accepted (gold standard) as definitively diagnosing and distinguishing NAFLD (including NAFL and NASH) from other forms of liver disease and can be used to assess the severity of the inflammation and resultant fibrosis. However, since most people affected by NAFLD are likely to be asymptomatic, liver biopsy presents too high a risk for routine diagnosis, so other methods are preferred, such as liver ultrasonography or liver MRI. For young people, guidelines recommend liver ultrasonography, but biopsy remains the best evidence. Liver biopsy is also the gold standard to detect hepatic fibrosis and assess its progression. Routine liver function blood tests are not sensitive enough to detect NAFLD, and biopsy is the only procedure that can reliably differentiate NAFL from NASH. There are several liver biopsy techniques available to obtain liver tissue. Percutaneous liver biopsy remains the most common practice. Biopsies can also be performed via the transvenous route, either during surgery or by laparoscopy, especially for people with contraindications to a percutaneous approach. The liver biopsy can also be image-guided, in real-time or not, which is recommended for some clinical situations such as people with known intra-hepatic lesions, previous intra-abdominal surgery who may have adhesions, a small liver that is difficult to percuss, obese people and people with evident ascites. Vital signs must be monitored frequently afterward (at least every 15 minutes in the hour following the biopsy). According to AASLD guidelines, a liver biopsy may be considered in people with NAFLD who are at increased risk of having steatohepatitis with or without advanced fibrosis, but only when all other competing chronic liver diseases are excluded (such as alcoholic liver disease). The presence of metabolic syndrome, NAFLD Fibrosis Score (FIB-4), or liver stiffness (as measured by Vibration-controlled transient elastography or MRE) can identify the individuals who are at higher risk of steatohepatitis or advanced fibrosis. The AASLD and ICD-11 consider that clinically useful pathology reporting distinguishes \\"between NAFL (steatosis), NAFL with inflammation and NASH (steatosis with lobular and portal inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning)\\" with the presence or absence of fibrosis being described and optionally comment on severity. The EASL recommends the Fatty Liver Inhibition of Progression (FLIP) algorithm to grade the ballooning and classify NAFLD-associated liver injury, and the use of the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) to grade the severity of NASH rather than for its diagnosis. They also consider the steatosis, activity, and fibrosis (SAF) score to be an accurate and reproducible scoring system. The AASLD recommends the use of the NAS scoring system with or without the SAF score if deemed appropriate. The Asia-Pacific Working Group on NAFLD disadvises the use of NAS, as it is considered uninformative for NAFLD and inappropriate to diagnose NASH. For liver fibrosis assessment, percutaneous liver biopsy, with or without image guidance, is contraindicated in uncooperative people. Transjugular liver biopsy is indicated for any person with diffuse liver disease who needs a biopsy but has a contraindication to percutaneous biopsy or needs a hemodynamic evaluation for diagnostic purposes. A transvenous liver biopsy is recommended instead of a percutaneous approach in people with clinically evident ascites, although percutaneous biopsy is an acceptable alternative approach after the removal of ascites. Management NAFLD warrants treatment regardless of whether the affected person is overweight or not. NAFLD is a preventable cause of death. Guidelines are available from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and the Asia-Pacific Working Party on NAFLD. Lifestyle Weight loss is the most effective treatment for NAFLD. A loss of 4% to 10% body weight is recommended, with 10% to 40% weight loss completely reversing NASH without cirrhosis. A structured weight loss program helps people with NAFLD lose more weight compared with advice alone. This type of program also leads to improvements in NAFLD measured using blood tests, ultrasound, imaging, or liver biopsies. Although fibrosis improves with lifestyle interventions and weight loss, there is limited evidence for cirrhosis improvement. A combination of improved diet and exercise, rather than either alone, appears to best help manage NAFLD and reduce insulin resistance. Motivational support, such as with cognitive behavioral therapy, is helpful, as most people with NAFLD do not perceive their condition as a disease, and thus have a low motivation to change. Higher-intensity behavioral weight loss therapies (diet and exercise combined) may produce more weight loss than lower-intensity ones. Weight loss is associated with improvements in biomarkers, NAFLD grade, and reduced chances of NASH, but their impact on long-term health is yet unknown. A 2019 systematic review thus suggests a change of guidelines to recommend these therapies for NAFLD management. =Diet= Treatment of NAFLD typically involves counseling to improve nutrition and calorie restriction. People with NAFLD can benefit from a moderate to low-carbohydrate diet and a low-fat diet. The Mediterranean diet also showed promising results in a 6-week study with a reduction of NASH induced inflammation and fibrosis, independently from weight loss. Tentative evidence supports dietary interventions in individuals with fatty liver who are not overweight. The EASL recommends energy restriction of 500‚Äì1000 kcal per week less than the normal daily diet (a very-low-calorie diet), a target of 7‚Äì10% weight loss for obese/overweight NAFLD, a low- to moderate-fat, and moderate- to high- carbohydrate diet, or a low-carbohydrate ketogenic or high-protein diet such as the Mediterranean diet, and avoiding all beverages and food containing fructose. Alcohol is an aggravating factor, and the AASLD recommends that people with NAFLD or NASH avoid alcohol consumption. The EASL allows alcohol consumption below 30g/day for men and 20g/day for women. The role of coffee consumption for NAFLD treatment is unclear though some studies indicate that regular coffee consumption may have protective effects. Vitamin E does not improve established liver fibrosis in those with NAFLD but seems to improve certain markers of liver function and reduces inflammation and fattiness of the liver in some people with NAFLD. The Asia-Pacific Work Group advises that Vitamin E may improve liver condition and aminotransferase levels, but only in adults without diabetes or cirrhosis who have NASH. The NICE guidelines recommend Vitamin E as an option for children and adults with NAFLD with advanced liver fibrosis, regardless of whether the person has diabetes mellitus. Herbal compounds such as silymarin (a milk thistle seed extract), curcumin, a turmeric extract, and green tea appear to improve NAFLD biomarkers and reduce the grade of NAFLD. Studies suggest an association between microscopic organisms that inhabit the gut (microbiota) and NAFLD. Reviews reported the use of probiotics and synbiotics (combinations of probiotics and prebiotics) were associated with improvement in liver-specific markers of hepatic inflammation, measurements of liver stiffness, and steatosis in persons with NAFLD. =Physical activity= Weight loss may improve NAFLD and is recommended particularly for obese or overweight people; similar physical activities and diets are advisable for overweight people with NAFLD as for other obese and overweight people. Although physical activity is less important for weight loss than dietary adaptations (to reduce caloric intake), the NICE advises physical activity to reduce liver fat even if there is no overall bodyweight reduction. Weight loss, through exercise or diet, is the most effective way to reduce liver fat and help NASH and fibrosis remission. Exercise alone can prevent or reduce hepatic steatosis, but it remains unknown whether it can improve all other aspects of the liver; hence a combined approach with diet and exercise is advised. Aerobic exercise may be more effective than resistance training, although there are contradictory results. Vigorous training is preferable to moderate training, as only the high- intensity exercise reduced the chances of NASH developing into steatohepatitis or advanced fibrosis. The EASL recommends between 150 and 200 min/week in 3 to 5 sessions of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or resistance training. Since both effectively reduce liver fat, a pragmatic approach to the choice of physical activity that accounts for the individual's preferences for what they can maintain in the long-term is preferred. Any engagement in physical activity or increase over previous levels is better than remaining sedentary. Medication Treatment with medications is primarily aimed at improving liver disease and is generally limited to those with biopsy-proven NASH and fibrosis. No medicines specifically for NAFLD or NASH had received approval, , although anti-diabetic medications may help in liver fat loss. While many treatments appear to improve biochemical markers such as alanine transaminase levels, most do not reverse histological abnormalities or improve outcomes. Insulin sensitizers (metformin and thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone) and liraglutide are not specifically recommended for NAFLD as they do not directly improve the liver condition. They can be indicated for diabetic individuals, after a careful assessment of risks, to reduce insulin resistance and risks of complications. Indeed, the side effects associated with thiazolidinedione medications, which include osteopenia, increased fracture risk, fluid retention, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer, and long-term weight gain, have limited their adoption. Due to these side effects, the AASLD recommends the use of pioglitazone only for individuals with biopsy- proven NASH, and the Asia-Pacific Work Group recommends them only for individuals with NAFLD with known diabetic issues. However, the AASLD advises against the use of metformin as studies were inconclusive about the improvement of the liver's histological condition. Although there was an improvement in insulin resistance and serum aminotransferases, this did not translate into NASH improvements. The NICE provides similar guidelines to the AASLD regarding pioglitazone and recommends it be administered in secondary care to adults with advanced liver fibrosis irrespective of whether or not they have diabetes. Statin medications appear to improve liver histology and markers of liver biochemistry in people with NAFLD. Since people with NAFLD are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, statin treatment is indicated. People with NAFLD are not at higher risk for serious liver injury from statins, according to AASLD and EASL. However, even if statins are safe to use in people with NASH cirrhosis, the AASLD suggests avoiding them in people with decompensated cirrhosis. Guidelines recommend statins to treat dyslipidemia for people with NAFLD. According to NICE guidelines, statins can continue unless liver enzyme levels double within three months of starting statins. Treatment with pentoxifylline is not recommended. As of 2018, neither the AASLD nor the Asia-Pacific Working Group recommends obeticholic acid or elafibranor due to inconsistent results for NASH treatment and concerns about safety. Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce liver fat and improve blood lipid profile but do not seem to improve liver histology (fibrosis, cirrhosis, cancer). The NICE does not recommend omega-3 fatty acid supplementation since randomized trials were inconclusive. Previous systematic reviews found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in those with NAFLD/NASH using doses of one gram daily or more (median dose four grams/day with median treatment duration six months) has been associated with improvements in liver fat. According to AASLD guidelines, \\"omega-3 fatty acids should not be used as a specific treatment of NAFLD or NASH, but they may be considered to treat hypertriglyceridemia for patients with NAFLD\\". Surgery severely obese individuals with NAFLD or NASH, bariatric surgery improves or cures the liver disease if there is no cirrhosis nor liver cancer. Bariatric surgery is an effective method for obese and diabetic individuals with NAFLD to induce weight loss and reduce or resolve NASH inflammation, including fibrosis, and improve longevity. For the AASLD, bariatric surgery can be considered only for NASH on a case-by-case basis by an experienced bariatric surgery program. Indeed, some individuals might develop new or worsened features of NAFLD. About 92% of people with NAFLD saw an improvement in steatosis and 70% a complete resolution after bariatric surgery. A preoperative diet such as a low-calorie diet or a very-low-calorie diet is usually recommended to reduce liver volume by 16‚Äì20%. Preoperative weight loss is the only factor associated with postoperative weight loss. Preoperative weight loss can reduce operative time and hospital stay, although there is insufficient evidence whether preoperative weight loss reduces long-term morbidity or complications. Weight loss and decreases in liver size may be independent of the amount of calorie restriction. The APWG on NAFLD recommends bariatric surgery as a treatment option for those with class II obesity (BMI >32.5 kg/m¬≤ for Asians, 35 kg/m¬≤ for Caucasians). They consider its effects on improving liver-related complications as unproven yet, but it effectively increases longevity by improving cardiovascular factors. Surgery carries more risks for individuals with NASH cirrhosis, with a review estimating overall morbidity to be 21%. For people with NAFLD who have undifferentiated cirrhosis, the APWG recommends an investigation to determine the cause of the cirrhosis as well as the person's liver function and whether they have portal hypertension. Screening Cardiovascular system screening is considered mandatory by the EASL, as NAFLD outcomes often result in cardiovascular complications, which can manifest as subclinical atherosclerosis, the cause of the majority of NAFLD-related deaths. People with NAFLD are at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and \\"aggressive modification of cardiovascular disease risk factors is warranted in all patients with NAFLD,\\" according to AASLD. The AASLD further recommends for people with a cirrhotic NASH to be systematically screened for gastric and esophageal varices and liver cancer. They do not recommend routine liver biopsies and screening for liver cancer for non- cirrhotic people with NASH, but such screening sometimes occurs on a case-by- case basis. Also, people with NAFLD may be considered for screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) and gastroesophageal varices. The NICE advises regular screening of NAFLD for advanced liver fibrosis every three years to adults and every two years for children using the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) blood test. Follow-up is recommended for people with obesity and insulin resistance using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). People with NASH with fibrosis and hypertension merit closer monitoring as there is a higher risk of disease progression. Transplantation NAFLD is the second most common indication for liver transplantation in the US and Europe as of 2017. NAFLD/NASH is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation by 2020. For people with NASH and end-stage liver disease, liver failure, or liver cancer, liver transplantation is an accepted procedure according to the EASL. People with NASH cirrhosis NASH who are being considered for a liver transplant warrant systematic evaluation for cardiovascular diseases (whether the symptoms are apparent or not). The overall survival is comparable to transplantation following other diseases. People with NASH cirrhosis who undergo liver transplantation are more likely to die post-transplant because of cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. These people with NASH are often older and are thus more prone to these complications. For these reasons and others, individuals with morbid obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m¬≤) and NASH with cirrhosis may be considered unfit for liver transplantation until they follow lifestyle modifications to reduce bodyweight. Diabetic people with poor glycemic control are at similar risks, and optimal glycemic control is essential before attempting transplantation. The Asia Pacific Working Group guidelines recommend healthcare providers discuss lifestyle modifications before and after transplantation to reduce potential surgery risks and to assist with NAFLD management after the transplant. Simultaneous bariatric surgery and liver transplantation were performed in exceptional circumstances. After transplantation, liver biopsy is the best method to monitor the evolution of post-transplant fibrosis, with significant fibrosis or portal hypertension one year after transplantation predicting rapid progression and graft loss and indicating the need for urgent intervention. Related complications There is no special treatment for liver cancer associated with NAFLD/NASH and are treated according to general guidelines on liver cancers. Prognosis The average progression rate from one stage of liver fibrosis to the next in humans with NASH is estimated to be seven years, compared to 14 years with NAFLD. The course of progression varies with different clinical manifestations among individuals. Fibrosis in humans with NASH progressed more rapidly than in humans with NAFLD. Obesity predicts a worse long-term outcome than for lean individuals. In the Asia-Pacific region, about 25% of NAFLD cases progress to NASH under three years, but only a low proportion (3.7%) develop advanced liver fibrosis. An international study showed that people with NAFLD had a 10‚Äêyear survival rate of 81.5%. NAFLD is a risk factor for fibrosis, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes based on very-low to low-quality evidence from observational studies. Although NAFLD can cause cirrhosis and liver failure and liver cancer, most deaths among people with NAFLD are attributable to cardiovascular disease. According to a meta-analysis of 34,000 people with NAFLD over seven years, these individuals have a 65% increased risk of developing fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events when compared to those without NAFLD. NAFLD and NASH increase the risk of liver cancer. Cirrhosis and liver cancer induced by NAFLD were the second cause of liver transplantation in the US in 2017. Liver cancer develops in NASH in the absence of cirrhosis in 45% in the cases, and people with NASH cirrhosis have an increased risk of liver cancer. The rate of liver cancer associated with NASH increased fourfold between 2002 and 2012 in the US, which is more than any other cause of liver cancer. NAFLD constitutes the third most common risk factor for liver cancer. NAFLD and NASH were found to worsen with cirrhosis in respectively 2‚Äì3% and 15‚Äì20% of the people over a 10‚Äì20 year period. Cirrhosis is found in only about 50% of people with NAFLD and with liver cancer, so that liver cancer and cirrhosis are not always linked. NAFLD may be a precursor of metabolic syndrome, although a bidirectional influence is possible. The presence and stage of fibrosis are the strongest prognostic factors for liver-related events and mortality, in particular for NAFLD. Epidemiology Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease prevalence in 2019 NAFLD incidence is rapidly rising, along with obesity and diabetes, and has become the most common cause of liver disease in developed countries, for adults, teenagers, and children. The percentage of people with NAFLD ranges from 9 to 36.9% in different parts of the world. Approximately 20% of the United States and 25% of the Asia-Pacific populations have non-alcoholic fatty liver. Similar prevalence can be found in Europe, although less data is available. NAFLD is the most common in the Middle East (32%) and South America (30%), while Africa has the lowest rates (13%). Compared to the 2000s, NAFL and NASH respectively increased 2-fold and 2.5-fold in the 2010s in the USA. NAFLD and NASH are more prevalent in Hispanics - which can be attributed to high rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes in Hispanic populations, intermediate in Whites, and lowest in Blacks. NAFLD was observed to be twice as prevalent in men as women. For severely obese individuals, the prevalence of NAFLD rises over 90%, and for those with diabetes, over 60%, and up to 20% for normal-weight people. NAFLD is present in 65% to 90% of people that had bariatric surgery, and up to 75% of them have NASH. Ultrasonography and proton NMR spectroscopy studies suggest about 25% of the population seems to be affected by NAFLD or NASH. Although the disease is commonly associated with obesity, a significant proportion of sufferers are normal weight or lean. Lean NAFLD affects between 10‚Äì20% of Americans and Europeans, and approximately 25% of the Asians, although some countries have a higher incidence (e.g., India has a very high proportion of lean NAFLD and almost no obese NAFLD). PNPLA3 may be relevant for the progression of NAFLD in lean people. Thus, people suffering from NAFLD deserve consideration for treatment regardless of the presence or absence of obesity. In children ages 1 to 19, the prevalence was found to be approximately 8% in the general population up to 34% in studies with data from child obesity clinics. The majority of cryptogenic cirrhosis is believed to be due to NASH. NAFLD prevalence is expected to increase steadily, from 25% in 2018 to a projected 33.5% of people with NAFLD globally in 2030, and from 20% to a projected 27% of those with NAFLD will progress to NASH. History The first acknowledged case of obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver was observed in 1952 by Samuel Zelman. Zelman started investigating after observing a fatty liver in a hospital employee who drank more than twenty bottles of Coca-Cola a day. He then went on to design a trial for a year and a half on 20 obese people who were not alcoholic, finding that about half of them had substantially fatty livers. Fatty liver was, however, linked to diabetes, atherosclerosis, and choline depletion since at least 1784 and sugar in 1949, and was already recognized as a common occurrence in severe diabetes in the 1930s. The name \\"non-alcoholic steatohepatitis\\" (NASH) was later defined in 1980 by Jurgen Ludwig and his colleagues from the Mayo Clinic to raise awareness of the existence of this pathology, as similar reports previously were dismissed as \\"patients' lies\\". This paper was mostly ignored at the time but eventually came to be seen as a landmark paper, and starting in the mid-1990s, the condition began to be intensively studied, with a series of international meetings being held on the topic since 1998. The broader NAFLD term started to be used around 2002. Diagnostic criteria began to be worked out, and in 2005 the Pathology Committee of the NIH NASH Clinical Research Network proposed the NAS scoring system. Society and culture= Political recommendations  EASL recommends Europe's public health authorities to \\"restrict advertising and marketing of sugar-sweetened beverages and industrially processed foods high in saturated fat, sugar, and salt\\", as well as \\"fiscal measures to discourage the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and legislation to ensure that the food industry improves labeling and the composition of processed foods\\", as well as \\"public awareness campaigns on liver disease, highlighting that it is not only linked to excessive consumption of alcohol\\". Lobbying In France, the French syndicate of non-alcoholic beverages \\"Boissons Rafra√Æchissantes de France\\" (that included soft drink producers such as Coca-Cola France, Orangina, PepsiCo France) was denounced by the French journal :fr:Canard Enchain√© for misleading consumers using a communication on their website titled \\"Better understanding the NASH pathology\\", explaining that \\"NASH pathology is sometimes called the soda illness by language abuse or an unfortunate semantic shortcut, as it is not directly linked to the consumption of non-alcoholic beverages\\". This page and others on the same website, such as one titled \\"Say no to disinformation,\\" were since then removed. Children Pediatric NAFLD was first reported in 1983. It is the most common chronic liver disease among children and adolescents since at least 2007, affecting 10 to 20% of them in the US in 2016. NAFLD is associated with metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of risk factors that contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies have demonstrated that abdominal obesity and insulin resistance, in particular, are significant contributors to the development of NAFLD. Coexisting liver diseases, such as hepatitis C and cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, are also associated with an increased risk of NAFLD. Some children were diagnosed as early as two years old, with a mean age of diagnosis between 11‚Äì13 years old. The mean age is usually above 10 years, as children can also report non-specific symptoms and are thus difficult to diagnose for NAFLD. Boys are more likely to be diagnosed with NAFLD than girls. Overweight, or even weight gain, in childhood and adolescence, is associated with an increased risk of NAFLD later in life, with adult NAFLD predicted in a 31-year follow-up study by risk factors during childhood including BMI, plasma insulin levels, male sex, genetic background (PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 variants) and low birth weight, an emerging risk factor for adulthood NAFLD. In a study, simple steatosis was present in up to 45% in children with a clinical suspicion of NAFLD. Children with simple steatosis have a worse prognosis than adults, with significantly more of them progressing from NAFLD to NASH compared to adults. Indeed, 17-25% of children with NAFLD develop a NASH in general, and up to 83% for children with severe obesity (versus 29% for adults), further suggesting that hepatic fibrosis seems to follow a more aggressive clinical course in children compared to adults. Early diagnosis of NAFLD in children may help prevent the development of liver disease during adulthood. This is challenging as most children with NAFLD are asymptomatic, with only 42-59% showing abdominal pain. Other symptoms might be present, such as right upper quadrant pain or acanthosis nigricans, the latter of which is often present in children with NASH. An enlarged liver occurs in 30‚Äì40% of children with NAFLD. The AASLD recommends a diagnostic liver biopsy in children when the diagnosis is unclear or before starting a potentially hepatotoxic medical therapy. The EASL suggests using fibrosis tests such as elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, and serum biomarkers to reduce the number of biopsies. In follow up, NICE guidelines recommend that healthcare providers offer children regular NAFLD screening for advanced liver fibrosis every two years using the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) blood test. Several studies also suggest magnetic resonance elastography as an alternative to the less reliable ultrasonography. Intensive lifestyle modifications, including physical activity and dietary changes, are the first line of treatment according to AASLD and EASL as it improves the liver histology and aminotransferase levels. In terms of pharmacological treatment, the AASLD and EASL do not recommend metformin, but vitamin E may improve liver health for some children. The NICE advises the use of vitamin E for children with advanced liver fibrosis, whether they have diabetes or not. The only treatment shown to be effective in childhood NAFLD is weight loss. Some evidence indicates that maternal undernutrition or overnutrition increases a child's susceptibility to NASH and hastens its progression. Research=Diagnosis and biomarkers Since a NAFLD diagnosis based on a liver biopsy is invasive and makes it difficult to estimate epidemiology, it is a high research priority to find accurate, inexpensive, and noninvasive methods of diagnosing and monitoring NAFLD disease and its progression. The search for these biomarkers of NAFLD, NAFL, and NASH involves lipidomics, medical imaging, proteomics, blood tests, and scoring systems. According to a review, proton density fat fraction estimation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-PDFF) may be considered the most accurate and even gold standard test to quantify hepatic steatosis. They recommend ultrasound-based transient elastography to accurately diagnose both fibrosis and cirrhosis in a routine clinical setting, with more objectivity than ultrasonography but with lower accuracy than magnetic resonance elastography; and plasma cytokeratin 18 (CK18) fragment levels to be a moderately accurate biomarker of steatohepatitis. However, transient elastography can fail for people with pre- hepatic portal hypertension. Medication development Medication development for NASH is very active and advancing rapidly. New medications are being designed to target various intrahepatic sites, from regulating lipids and glucose homeostasis to oxidant stress and mitochondrial targets in hepatocytes, inflammatory signals on hepatocytes, and intracellular targets related to hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis. , clinical trials are underway for cenicriviroc, elafibranor, obeticholic acid, and selonsertib in phase 3, and several others in phase 2. Since NAFLD is a complex disease that involves several organs and tissues, combination therapies (combining compounds) and conjugate therapies (combining drugs and non-pharmacological therapies such as behavioral therapies or lifestyle changes) are investigated as a way to increase the efficiency of medical treatment. However, most trials were relatively short, from three to 18 months, whereas real-world use will involve administration in the long-term.

She released her debut album, Wind-Up Canary, in 2006 on Hush Records. Dienel has also performed and recorded as White Hinterland, whose first album, titled Phylactery Factory, was released on March 4, 2008, by the independent record label Dead Oceans. Dienel plays piano, keyboards and ukulele. Early life and education Casey Dienel spent the bulk of her youth in Scituate, Massachusetts. She took her first piano lessons at age 4, and at age 14 began writing her own pop songs.Casey Dienel: Shining A Floodlight On The Humanness Of Strippers And At Least One Ladies Man While attending Scituate High School, Dienel formed a short-lived band named The Bong Loads. After high school, Dienel moved to Boston to attend the New England Conservatory of Music, having turned down an offer of acceptance from Sarah Lawrence College. After one semester of studying classical vocals, she opted to switch her major to classical composition. Dienel studied with many notable musicians at the conservatory, including jazz vocalist Dominique Eade and composer Lee Hyla. While living in Boston during her conservatory years, Dienel met Dylan Metrano of the band Tiger Saw, and was an occasional member of the band's rotating lineup. After two years at the conservatory, Dienel took an indefinite leave of absence to pursue her own music career. Early solo work=Wind-Up Canary During the winter of 2005, Dienel was offered the chance to record for free at an abandoned caretaker's house on a farm in Leominster, Massachusetts. With some conservatory friends and a piano borrowed from the lobby of a local hotel, she recorded a number of her own songs without any intention of releasing them. Without Dienel's knowledge, a copy of these recordings made its way to Chad Crouch, the head of Hush Records, who contacted her about releasing an album.Hush Records: Casey Dienel - \\"Wind-Up Canary\\" Dienel agreed and Hush released the recordings as Wind-Up Canary in March 2006 to widely favorable reviews. Vessels On November 29, 2006, Casey Dienel announced that she was working with producer Djim Reynolds on recording an EP titled Vessels, and that she hoped to release it in early 2007. Dienel had this to say about the project: To date, Vessels remains unreleased‚Äîhowever, there are live recordings and lyrics for the song available on the Internet. White Hinterland=Phylactery Factory On January 4, 2008, after a few months hinting at \\"change,\\"Musings: Bleating Hearts Dienel announced in her blog that \\"for the present and foreseeable future, there won‚Äôt be any more Casey Dienel.\\"Musings: Ends in the Beginnings. Her blog post coincided with Dead Oceans' announcement of the forthcoming release of White Hinterland's album Phylactery Factory: Luniculaire In 2009, White Hinterland released an EP called Luniculaire. Kairos On March 9, 2010, White Hinterland released its second full-length album, Kairos, via Dead Oceans. Pitchfork rated the album 7.5 on its 10-point scale, with reviewer Patrick Sisson writing that Dienel \\"swoons on 'Cataract' and 'Magnolias', two of the gorgeous tracks in which her sweet tone and confident phrasing, along with unfurled guitar melodies, recall Bitte Orca,\\" the acclaimed 2009 album from the Dirty Projectors. Reviewing \\"Icarus\\", the first single off of Kairos, Brandon Stusoy noted the songs \\"hushed experimental threads\\" and said compared to previous work, Icarus \\"pushes things deeper and then recasts it in a denser electro realm.\\" White Hinterland released videos for Kairos songs \\"Amsterdam,\\" \\"Begin Again,\\" and \\"No Logic\\". In 2010, White Hinterland toured the US and Europe with the album. A song from this album, \\"Icarus\\", was selected by Revlon to be used in their 2010 commercial for Just Bitten Lip Stain, starring Jessica Biel and directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Later the same year, \\"Icarus\\" was featured in an episode of the ABC Family drama \\"Pretty Little Liars,\\" as well the fashion show of the winner of the Project Runway (season 8) finale, Gretchen Jones. The song was also used in the 2010 film It's Kind of a Funny Story. Baby White Hinterland released its third studio album Baby on April 1, 2014 through Dead Oceans.\\"Manic\\" Press release on the new album. Dienel made the ten-song album in a home studio she developed in the basement of her childhood home in Scituate. Controversy In May 2016, it was reported that Justin Bieber and Skrillex were being sued for copyright infringement by White Hinterland, who claims the duo used Dienel's vocal loop from her 2014 song \\"Ring the Bell\\" without permission in the song \\"Sorry\\". Eight seconds of the \\"Ring the Bell\\" riff is allegedly used six times in \\"Sorry.\\" Co-writers are also included in the suit. Producer Skrillex responded to the claim by uploading a video of himself manipulating the vocals of co-writer Julia Michaels. The lawsuit was later dropped.  Further solo work =Imitation Of A Woman To Love On May 18, 2017, Dienel released another album under her own name, entitled Imitation Of A Woman To Love; Dienel served as the album's writer, singer, producer and engineer. She released two singles from the album: \\"High Times\\" (released April 12, 2017; Dienel played every and \\"Thrasher\\" (April 28, 2017). Writing for Rolling Stone, Maura Johnston called the album a \\"sprawling, stunning collection\\".

It is located around the town of Knin. Geography Kninska Krajina is situated between Bukovica in the southwest, Lika in the northwest, Drni≈°ka krajina (in Zagora) in the south, Cetinska krajina in the southwest, and (Zavr≈°je) Bosnia and Herzegovina in the east. History=Middle Ages In the 6th century, the region was settled by Slavs (Sklavenoi). Knin itself was first mentioned by Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus (r. 913‚Äì959) as the centre of a parish under Croatian rule. At the request of King Peter Kre≈°imir IV of Croatia (r. 1058‚Äì1075), Knin became an episcopal see and the bishop of Knin held a title bishop of Croats (episcopus Chroatorum). Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia (r. 1075‚Äì1089) was seated in the town. There are remains of Serbian churches and monasteries in this region dating from 15th century. This suggest that Serb people lived here for several centuries. In the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire occupied the area resulting in most of the native population fleeing the region. It was largely abandoned and devastated as the Ottoman army advanced towards the north and west. The region was administrated into the Sanjak of Kirka. Modern period By the 17th and 18th centuries, the Austrian Empire managed to thwart the Ottoman advances; meanwhile, the area had been slowly repopulated by Eastern Orthodox Christian Serbs since at least the 15th century. These Serbs had fled the Ottomans and were given lands in exchange for military service in the so-called Military Frontier (the Austro-Hungarian- Ottoman buffer zone). In 1990, the Serbian autonomous region known as SAO Kninska Krajina was established with a local government, named after this geographical region. This region, along with other Serb-inhabited autonomous regions were merged to form the Republic of Serbian Krajina which sought to remain in union with Serbia and Montenegro upon Croatia's proclamation of independence in 1991. The area was ethnically cleansed of non-Serbs. In 1995, the Croatian army retook the region in Operation Storm, and the majority of the Serb population fled or was brutally cleansed. Today, the region is sparsely populated due to few economic opportunities. See also *Geography of Croatia References *Dr Jovan Plav≈°a, Stanovni≈°tvo Kninske Krajine, Novi Sad, 1997.

It was developed by UK-based developer Pivotal Games. The game was released on Xbox, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2. Gameplay There are four playable characters in the game each with a special ability. They include MacDonald, who can speak German to pass himself off as a guard; Hendley, who can pick pockets to get papers, keys, etc.; Hilts, who can pick locks to get into buildings; and Sedgwick, who can fix mechanical devices. Captain \\"Virgil\\" Hilts is American with an attitude. Hendley is an American who joined the RAF Eagle Squadron before the US joined the war. The other characters are citizens of Great Britain or the British Empire: MacDonald is Scottish and Sedgwick is Australian. There are 18 levels in the game, most of which have fictional tasks and attacks, most of which did not happen in the movie. The plot-line follows that of the film of the same name, except there are also levels featuring some of the characters first captures and early escape attempts, as well as a changed ending where all four playable characters escape in the end, whereas in the film, only Sedgwick escapes, Hendley and Hilts are recaptured, and MacDonald is executed. Also, despite the cover showing Hilts with a gun hiding from a guard in the camp, this never occurs in the game or film. The front cover may be inspired by a scene late in the film where Hilts disguised in German uniform, holds a gun while hiding behind a shed after trying to escape a German patrol on a motorbike. Cast information Sound bites of Steve McQueen as Hilts were taken from the film and used in the game, famous lines such as \\"250\\", \\"Walking down the road\\" and \\"20 feet short\\" were used to recreate iconic scenes from the film. Two sounds bites of McQueen replying \\"Yeah\\" were also used to respond in the affirmative when talking to other characters. The original film score by Elmer Bernstein is heard throughout the game and adds to the authenticity. Reception The Great Escape received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, where the PlayStation 2 version was ported and published by Marvelous Entertainment under the name on 14 October 2004, Famitsu gave it a score of 27 out of 40.

After many successful years the mill of operation, the mill closed in 1894, after most of Michigan's Lower Peninsula had been effectively deforested. While many lumber mill owners moved their operations to the Pacific Northwest, Hackley remained in Muskegon and focused on urban revitalization of that city. Hackley became Muskegon's biggest philanthropist. In his own words: \\"A rich man to a great extent owes his fortune to the public. He makes money largely through the labor of his employees....Moreover, I believe that it should be expended during the lifetime of the donor, so that he can see that his benefactions do not miscarry and are according to his intent....To a certain extent, I agree with Mr. Carnegie....that it is a crime to die rich.\\" Statue of Charles Hackley in downtown Muskegon Hackley's gifts to the city of Muskegon were valued at $12.0 million in 1905. They included: * Hackley Public Library ‚Äì site, building, contents, and an endowment * Hackley Art Gallery ‚Äì site, building, contents, and an acquisition fund (renamed Muskegon Museum of Art) * Hackley Park ‚Äì park, statues, and soldier's monument * Hackley Manual Training School and Gymnasium ‚Äì site, building, and equipment * Hackley School, later home to Muskegon Community College, renamed Hackley Administration Building * Hackley Athletic Field (renamed Hackley Stadium ‚Äì seats 10,000 for Muskegon High School football games) * Hackley Hospital ‚Äì site, buildings, medical supplies and equipment, and an endowment * City of Muskegon ‚Äì Poor Fund Endowment * Julia E. Hackley Educational Fund Endowment * Muskegon Humane Union Endowment * C. H. Hackley Hose Company No. 2 Hackley was much more than a philanthropist. He and his business partner, Thomas Hume, were strong supporters of the city of Muskegon. Armed with funding from the Muskegon Industrial fund, they were able to convince several companies to open shop in Muskegon (most notably, Brunswick, Central Paper Co (now Sappi Fine Paper) and Continental Motors (now L-3 Communications Inc.)). Growth of these companies would later provide thousands of jobs to Muskegonites for much of the twentieth century. Hackley is not only credited with his gifts to the city but also stopping the ebb of people leaving Muskegon for jobs elsewhere after the lumber industry folded. The Hackley house is a historic site Both Hackley's and Hume's homes are still standing. After a major restoration in the mid-1990s, they are open for tour to community visitors. Also open for tour is The City Barn, which served as the pairs stable for horses and equipment. In addition, a replica of the building that housed the C. H. Hackley Hose Company No. 2 also serves as a museum. All are part of the Muskegon County Museum which is located downtown. Hackley also founded the neighboring city of Muskegon Heights. His portrait was painted in 1904 by artist Herbert A. Collins. The painting was hung in the then newly completed Hackley Hospital.Biography of Herbert Alexander Collins, by Alfred W.

It allows for a broader group of non-citizens to qualify for benefits than just those with green cards. This status is used solely for benefit application purposes and is not recognized as an immigration status by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This category was created by the courts and is a public benefits eligibility category. For a person to be residing \\"under color of law,\\" the USCIS must know of the person‚Äôs presence in the U.S., and must provide the person with written assurance that enforcement of deportation is not planned. A person residing under PRUCOL status cannot directly apply for U.S. citizenship or sponsor family members to obtain U.S. Citizenship. A person from any country, who resides in the United States without current legal immigration status including, but not limited to, citizenship, permanent residency, unexpired immigrant visa, is an undocumented person. Though they are not U.S. citizens, they are considered to have the same rights as legal residents ‚Äòfor welfare eligibility purposes‚Äô. Legal status Under what came to be known as the \\"PRUCOL\\" doctrine, even an alien who was unquestionably present in the United States contrary to law could be PRUCOL. This was expounded by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in In the statutes defining eligibility criteria for federal benefits, the U.S. Congress provided for payment of benefits, not only to lawful immigrants, but to aliens \\"permanently residing under color of law.\\" Thus, if the USCIS is aware of the alien's unlawful presence, but was not actively pursuing his or her deportation, the alien is eligible for benefits. Under this doctrine aliens with no legal right to remain in the United States are nevertheless eligible for public assistance. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (\\"PRWORA\\") basically abolished the PRUCOL Doctrine for means tested federal assistance by creating a new statutory definition of \\"qualified alien.\\" It is true that the expression \\"permanently residing under color of law\\" remains in many Federal, State and City statutes and regulations; but, with a few exceptions clearly specified by statute, an alien \\"who is not a qualified alien is not eligible for any Federal public benefit.\\" Congress has also made aliens ineligible for many public benefits available under State and local law. Children benefits Section 153 of the Federal Immigration Act of 1990 provides Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) to undocumented children who (1) are under 21, (2) are unmarried, (3) have been abandoned, neglected or abused by at least one birth parent, (4) have been declared dependent on the juvenile court (often through a guardianship proceeding) or deemed eligible for long-term foster care, and (5) for whom the court has declared that it is not in the child‚Äôs best interest to be returned to his country of origin. A grant of SIJS does not automatically confer lawful permanent resident status; instead, it makes the child eligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident. Sometimes the derogatory term \\"anchor baby\\" is wrongly used to describe a child under PRUCOL status. The confusion stems from the fact that, because children born in the U.S. of one or two undocumented parents are U.S. citizens; once they become adults they may petition for their parents to gain legal status. The person under PRUCOL status is the parent, not the baby. If a sibling petitions for the family member who entered the US without a visa, a return to and wait in the country of origin is mandatory. Categories In general persons attain PRUCOL status by reason of a court decision of ‚Äústay of deportation‚Äù. In many cases it is left to the individual city or state benefits agency to decide if a person has this status. For additional information on one Agency‚Äôs definition of PRUCOL see Office of the New York City Mayor, Public Health Insurance Options Florida Homestead Exemption - PRUCOL Application Under Florida law, only U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, or a someone holding PRUCOL status is eligible for a Homestead Exemption. A person in the U.S. with asylum or parole refugee status is considered PRUCOL. A person in the US under a temporary visa is NOT eligible for Homestead, pursuant to Rule 12D-7.007(3), Florida Administrative Code. A person in the U.S. under \\"Temporary Protected Status\\" is also not eligible. This is true under Florida law no matter how long you have owned your home and lived/worked in Florida‚Äîand regardless of how many times you are legally able to renew your visa.

It is the home ground of Crusaders, and traditionally hosts the final of the Steel & Sons Cup on Christmas Day. The stadium holds 3,383, and has a 4G playing surface. Seaview has undergone considerable redevelopment in recent seasons, with new changing rooms, dug-outs and main-stand seats being installed. Three new stands at either end of the ground and on its southern side were opened in July 2011 to replace the previous terracing. Location and access Seaview was opened in 1921 as the home venue of Crusaders Football Club and is located on the Shore Road, approximately one mile north of Belfast city centre. The ground is flanked by the Shore Road behind one goal and the Belfast-to-Larne railway behind the other. The main entrance to the ground is on St Vincent Street while the opposite side of the ground backs on to a goods warehouse yard from a side street off the Shore Road. In addition to hosting Crusaders, the ground is the traditional venue for the Christmas Day final of the Steel & Sons Cup, an intermediate competition organised by the County Antrim & District F.A. St Vincent Street stand and club offices and social club The main entrance to Seaview is from its St Vincent Street side and is made up of two distinct structures, the club offices and social club and a covered (partly uncovered) stand which was converted from a terrace to a seated stand in July 2011 and was officially opened on the day of the visit of Fulham F.C. in a UEFA Europa League tie. The partially covered stand runs halfway along the side of the ground from the Shore Road/St Vincent Street corner and in June 2011 was converted from a terrace to an all-seated stand for 1,100 spectators. The stand can be accessed from two new turnstiles on the Shore Road or from entrances on St Vincent Street, located at either side of the social club. The two-tier club offices and social club were opened in 1970 after a fire destroyed the club's previous office location two years earlier. The main entrance to the ground floor is on St Vincent Street and leads directly into the club members' bar, which has a big-screen TV and fruit machines. The remainder of the ground floor is used for the club offices and board room and was formerly where the dressing rooms were located. The first floor is largely made up of the main club function room, which has two bars, a dance-floor and big-screen TV and also serves meals on matchdays. The club has recently submitted plans to build a new 1,246 all-seater stand with provision for offices, changing rooms and car-parking. Main stand The main stand is situated on the opposite side of the ground from the club offices and is a single-tier structure, covering half the length of the field, straddling the halfway line. There is also a small section of open terracing on one side and a small access space with gates and two entrances on its other side. The entrances are rarely, if ever, used and access is normally made from St Vincent Street, via the railway end of the ground. The original main stand was built in the early 1950s and was flanked by open terracing on both sides, but both the stand and terracing on one side was demolished in the early 1970s to make way for the current elevated single-tier stand. Originally, the stand was laid out with bench seating until the early 21st century when one section was laid out in red plastic seats with the letter C spelled out in white. This looked like the beginning of a plan to lay the entire stand out in the same style spelling out the word \\"Crues\\", but financial problems stalled the redevelopment with the completed section restyled as a family enclosure. The entire stand was converted to red seating in 2009, and the stand now spells out the name of the pitch sponsor, TAL, in white. Although the stand is a single tier, it is elevated from the ground and is accessed by two staircases at either end while a third staircase in the middle is closed on matchdays. This is due to the lower concourse being redeveloped in 2009 as the technical area while new dressing rooms were built in the space under the stands. The stand seats 850 spectators A small section of open terrace, which can accommodate fifty spectators remains from the original development of the ground in the 1940s and a small club shop is also located here. The Railway End The Railway End is so called due to it backing directly onto the Belfast-Larne railway line. The small uncovered terrace was laid to steps in the early 1950s but The need for development was highlighted in the mid-2000s when the perimeter exterior wall partially collapsed in a storm. A small elevated viewing lounge for VIPs and invited guests of the club, with a small tuck shop located underneath, once stood at the end of the terrace but this was demolished in May 2011 as part of a major redevelopment of the ground that saw a new 650 all-seated stand erected. New turnstiles were also put in place from the St Vincent Street entrance and a disabled section was added. This too was opened on the night of the Fulham game. There is also a burger bar regularly located in the concourse before the stand. Shore Road End Like the Railway End, the Shore Road End stood for over half a century as a shallow open terrace, which, for safety reasons had been reduced to a capacity of a few hundred. This end too was badly in need of redevelopment and was converted into a brand new stand that was part of the redevelopment of the ground. The new covered stand was also opened for the Fulham game, housing 633 spectators including eight disabled spaces.

He was sentenced in June 2007 to three to ten years in prison. In December 2009, after 30 months in prison, he was released for good behavior at the age of 77. The New York Times, commenting on Garson's conviction, observed: \\"It was news that confirmed every sneaking suspicion, every paranoid fantasy of anyone who had ever felt wronged in a divorce court.\\"Eaton, Leslie, \\"Aggrieved Parties in Divorce Court Get No Relief in Scandal\\", The New York Times, October 12, 2004.

In 1962 he founded the law firm Gerber & Garson, on Court Street in Brooklyn, with Howard Gerber.Brick, Michael, \\"Humbled by Scandal, Judge Begins Prison Term\\", The New York Times, June 29, 2007.

In 1984, Garson was censured by the state Appellate Division for \\"conferring gifts, gratuities and benefits\\", by giving an improper gift to a judge with whom he had a \\"long-standing social relationship\\". Garson and members of his firm regularly appeared before then- New York Civil Court Judge Frank Vaccaro. In 1972, Garson treated Judge Vaccaro and his wife to a weekend vacation at Kutsher's County Club in the Catskills, and falsely registered the judge under an assumed name; later, he lied about the incident to investigators. Vaccaro, by then a New York State Supreme Court Justice, was suspended without pay for six months. Garson was also Treasurer from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s for a political action committee arm of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, the Brooklyn Democrats. He was appointed by his former law practice colleague, Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden. Justice of the NY Supreme Court (1998‚Äì2003) In 1997, Garson was placed on the ballot to be a Democratic Party nominee for the position of Justice of the New York Supreme Court, the highest state court below the appellate level, and the equivalent of county court. He was placed on the ballot by Clarence Norman Jr., a long-time Kings County Democratic Party leader. Garson then won the 1998 general election. He became a Justice of the State Supreme Court, with an annual salary of $136,700. His courtroom was in \\"Matrimonial Part 5B\\", in the Municipal Building on Joralemon Street in Brooklyn Heights. In five years as a Justice, Garson handled 1,100 matrimony cases. He made decisions on child custody, and divided families' financial assets. In an anonymous survey of lawyers, he was described as \\"always well prepared\\", and as having \\"excellent settlement skills.\\" In the 2004‚Äì05 edition of New York Judge Reviews and Court Directory, Garson received the following comments in anonymous reviews, under the section \\"Temperament/Demeanor\\": > Nearly every interviewee complimented Judge Garson's demeanor. 'He's > pleasant, and will let you try your case. He's excellent‚Äîa real lawyer's > judge.' 'He's easy to get along with.' 'He can be pleasant.' 'He's nice and > very competent.' Only one lawyer criticized [him], saying, '[Judge Garson > is] tough, and can be aggressive and impatient.' Garson also received good ratings for his legal knowledge, administration of his courtroom, and handling of trials and settlements. He was rated \\"approved\\" by the local bar association. In 2001, he was applauded by feminists for ordering an Orthodox Jewish man to pay his ex-wife $500-a-week for life, because the man refused to grant her a religious divorce, or get. Indictment, arrest, and related events (2003‚Äì07)=Sting operation, indictment, and arrest In October 2002, Frieda Hanimov, an Israeli √©migr√© nurse, called a hotline at the District Attorney's (DA's) Office. The mother of three, was at the time embroiled in a bitter child-custody dispute that was being heard by Judge Garson. She complained that she had been told that her husband, Yuri Hanimov, had bribed the judge to fix their case, and that he had done so through Nissim Elmann (reputedly a \\"fixer\\", who arranged bribes in divorce and custody cases) and Paul Siminovsky (the divorce lawyer whom Garson had appointed as law guardian for her children). The woman had learned this when she herself met with Elmann, seeking to bribe Garson. Elmann told her that she was too late, inasmuch as her husband had already paid a large bribe to receive a favorable ruling. Within days, the DA's Office had her wearing a wire, meeting with and secretly taping Elmann. Garson was subsequently indicted and arrested in April 2003 outside of his Upper East Side apartment. He was charged with having accepted cash and other gifts from Siminovsky, as payment for preferential treatment. The treatment included Judge Garson privately coaching Siminovsky as to what questions he should ask, and what arguments he should use. Garson would then rule in Siminovsky's favor.\\"February 2006 Calendar\\", State of New York Court of Appeals, 2006. Retrieved July 20, 2010. This violated the rules of judicial conduct, which prohibit a judge from speaking privately with an attorney who has a case pending, without the presence or permission of the opposing attorney. Garson was suspended from the bench without pay on May 22, 2003, by the Court of Appeals of New York. He ultimately resigned and retired.Brick, Michael, \\"Court Theatrics as Lawyers Duel at Ex-Judge's Trial in Brooklyn\\", The New York Times, April 12, 2007. Retrieved July 20, 2010. In 2006, he received, but rejected an offer to plead guilty to two minor felonies, in exchange for a 16-month sentence in a local jail. His trial was delayed as he sought treatment for cancer and underwent surgery, and while pre-trial rulings on the charges against him were litigated. Prosecution of others charged in the scheme Others charged with felonies linked to the Garson bribery scheme were: Siminovsky (who was ultimately sentenced to only one year in prison, as a result of his cooperation and a plea bargain), the \\"fixer\\" (sentenced to 16 months to 5¬Ω years in prison), a court officer (sentenced to 1‚Äì4¬Ω years in prison), two of Siminovsky's clients who paid what they understood were bribes (sentenced to three months in prison and 150 hours of community service, and to 210 hours of community service), and a former Garson court clerk (acquitted). Two long-time employees in the main court clerk's office, who were not arrested, were suspended without pay. =Lawyer= Siminovsky, a lawyer who appeared before Garson in divorce cases, was arrested on February 25, 2003.Newman, Andy, \\"In a Judge‚Äôs Corruption Trial, Tapes Reveal Tips to a Lawyer\\", The New York Times, March 23, 2007. Retrieved July 20, 2010. He had a friendship with Garson going back to 2001 and spent an extraordinary amount of time with him outside of court, taking him out and paying for lunches, dinners, and drinks. In a November 18, 2002, in a recorded telephone conversation, he told Elmann (the \\"fixer\\") that he had just spent two hours getting Garson drunk, and that \\"[h]e'll do what we want.\\" On the morning he was arrested, Siminovsky was taken to the Fort Hamilton army base in Bay Ridge for questioning. He confessed within half an hour, and subsequently confessed to bribery. He made a deal with the investigators, agreeing to cooperate in the investigation of Garson in exchange for a reduced charge (a plea bargain), and the promise of a positive letter from the DA to Siminovsky's sentencing judge.Brick, Michael, \\"Ex-Lawyer Recalls Dealings with Judge in Bribery Case\\", The New York Times, March 28, 2007.

Within hours, he was wearing a hidden body microphone in a sting operation, as he joined Garson for lunch at the Archives Restaurant on Adams Street.Brick, Michael, \\"Sentencing is Epilogue in Corruption Case\\", The New York Times, June 27, 2007. Retrieved July 20, 2010. He continued to wear the wire for weeks in meetings with Garson. Siminovsky testified for 13 days at two different trials. and ultimately helped prosecutors win convictions for nine people. Siminovsky, himself, as part of his plea bargain, pleaded guilty to a Class A misdemeanor for having given unlawful gratuities. In June 2007, Acting Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey G. Berry, a visiting judge from Orange County, New York, sentenced him to a year in prison, the maximum sentence for the misdemeanor. He also lost his license to practice law, and agreed never to apply for reinstatement. =Bribers= Ezra Zifrani and his daughter Esther Weitzner pleaded guilty in February 2004 to one misdemeanor conspiracy charge. They admitted having given $5,000 to Elmann (the \\"fixer\\"), to influence Garson's handling of a custody dispute between Weitzner and her ex-husband involving their five children. They said that Elman \\"clearly implied\\" he was going to bribe Garson. They did not know, however, whether the money was actually paid to Garson. Supreme Court Justice Michael Ambrosio ruled in August 2004 that Weizner was an unfit parent for her children, because she paid the bribe. In exchange for their pleas and their cooperation in the investigation, in August 2007 they were each sentenced to 210 hours of community service and three years of probation. Avraham Levi pleaded guilty in June 2004 to having given the \\"fixer\\" $10,000 in December 2002, to get his case in front of and obtain favorable treatment from Garson (a Class E felony).Newman, Andy, \\"Judge‚Äôs Coaching of a Lawyer Broke the Rules, Jurors are Told\\", The New York Times, March 21, 2007. Retrieved July 20, 2010. There was no evidence that the money ever made its way to Garson. Subsequent to the husband's payment to the fixer, Garson awarded him exclusive custody of the couple's two oldest sons. Garson did not have an opportunity to rule on the couple's house, because he was arrested beforehand. In 2005, after the bribery scandal had broken and the case was moved to another judge, 100% of the marital residence was awarded to the wife. For his role in the corruption scandal, Justice Berry sentenced Levi to three months in jail, 150 hours of community service, and five years' probation following his release. =Court officer and court clerk= Louis Salerno (a 24-year-veteran court officer, who had been placed on modified duty) and Paul Sarnell (Garson's former senior court clerk, who had retired in 2002) were tried for allegedly accepting bribes to steer Simonivsky's cases to Garson. Their five-week trial ended in August 2004. Prosecutors charged that Elmann would send potential clients to Siminovsky, who would then in turn enlist Salerno or Sarnell to steer his clients' divorce cases (which were supposed to be assigned randomly) to Garson. Prosecutors said that when Siminovsky needed a case to come before Garson, the defendants would go to an administrative clerk and tell her that Garson wanted the case reassigned to him. According to the prosecutors, the defendants received thousands of dollars in cash, plane tickets, and plastic bags of electronic equipment from Elmann's warehouse for their efforts. Siminovsky testified at their trial. He said that after Salerno demanded $2,000 in order to have a Siminovsky case assigned to Garson, Siminovsky slipped the money into Salerno's pocket as they stood at adjacent urinals in a public courthouse restroom in Brooklyn. The court officer was also videotaped accepting a DVD player and VCRs from the lawyer in front of the Joralemon Street courthouse on March 27, 2003. Salerno was convicted of two felonies, bribe-receiving and receiving a reward for official misconduct, and sentenced in August 2007 to 1‚Äì4¬Ω years in prison. Sarnell's counsel maintained that anything improper that Sarnell might have done was done on Garson's orders. Sarnell was acquitted. =\\"Fixer\\"= In February 2005, Nissim Elmann, portrayed by prosecutors as a \\"fixer\\", pleaded guilty to seven felonies and six misdemeanors. He had been charged with bribery and conspiracy, for accepting bribes in divorce and child custody cases that he steered to Garson. Elmann was a Crown Heights, Brooklyn, wholesale electronics dealer and salesman, with a business named \\"DVD Trading\\" on Brooklyn Avenue. He himself had appeared before Garson as a divorce litigant in 2000. He subsequently boasted in the Orthodox Jewish community in central Brooklyn, beginning in 2001, that for a price he could help parties in divorce cases make sure their case was heard by a sympathetic judge. Elmann admitted to accepting thousands of dollars of cash (including $24,000 from three divorce litigants), and passing them on to Siminovsky to arrange preferential treatment for litigants in six cases before Garson. Though Elmann had asserted to his potential clients that he had direct contact with Garson (telling one mother, for example: \\"He will do everything for me. The problem is how much [will] you sacrifice?\\"), evidence later showed that he only had contact with Siminovsky, and he later admitted he did not know the judge. Elmann was sentenced in August 2007 to 16 months‚àí5¬Ω years in prison, with Justice Berry saying \\"Justice is not for sale\\". Elmann was denied parole in 2008, and was not eligible to try again until July 2010. Other ramifications Fifty motions to reopen divorce cases that had been handled by Garson were received by New York's chief administrative judge for matrimonial cases. Of those, three or four were granted a hearing, and eventually settled. However, even in cases that involved both Garson and Siminovsky, rulings were not necessarily reviewed or overturned. To receive a hearing, parties were required to demonstrate some likelihood that they had not received a fair trial. Criticizing a process that required parties who did not have subpoena powers or wiretaps to prove corruption in each case, the President of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women said: \\"The burden of proof is going to fall on them to show the case is corrupted; and how are they going to do that?\\" The system of nominating judges was ruled unconstitutional by New York's Second Circuit. However, upon appeal to the Supreme Court that ruling was reversed. https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-766.ZO.html Justice Scalia wrote the opinion. Justice Stevens wrote a concurring opinion in which Justice Souter joined, where he quoted Justice Thurgood Marshall in a scathing criticism of New York State's judicial election laws in that \\"The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.\\" https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-766.ZC.html Prosecutors also complained of a \\"culture of corruption\\" in the court's matrimonial section, and Garson's case led to a widespread political and judicial corruption inquiry in Brooklyn. The TV show Law and Order aired an episode entitled \\"Floater\\" on November 12, 2003, relating to a corruption scandal in Brooklyn Supreme Court in which a judge accepted bribes in return for giving litigants preferential treatment. The episode was \\"ripped from the headlines\\" of the Garson matter. Correspondent Lesley Stahl reported the Garson story for CBS's 48 Hours on February 18, 2005. In addition, Frieda Hanimov was compared to whistle-blower Erin Brockovich, and Warner Brothers purchased the rights to a movie entitled The Frieda Hanimov Story. Democratic Party sting cooperation When Garson was arrested, he was confronted with surveillance videotapes from a video camera that the DA's Office had installed in his robing room chambers' ceiling pursuant to a December 9, 2002, warrant. After seeing the videotapes, he agreed to wear a wire to secretly tape conversations with Democratic Party leaders. His goal was to gather evidence that a seat on the bench could be purchased by paying cash to the county Democratic Party and to Norman, the Democratic Party leader who had helped place Garson on the bench.Brick, Michael, \\"Former Brooklyn Officials Surrender for Prison Terms\\", The New York Times, June 6, 2007. Retrieved July 23, 2010. But he was unsuccessful in his effort to tape Democratic Party officials discussing buying and selling judgeships. Norman was convicted, however, due to information that prosecutors say Garson provided. Norman was sent to prison for extortion, soliciting illegal contributions from a lobbyist, and stealing $5,000 from his re-election committee.Chan, Sewell, \\"Judge Rules That Suit Against ‚ÄòLaw & Order‚Äô Creator May Continue\\", The New York Times, March 20, 2008.

Trial and conviction (2007) New York Supreme Court, Brooklyn, New York The audience for Garson's four-week trial \\"included a good number of displeased divorc√©es\\", observed The New York Times. as well as members of various divorce Advocacy groups including The Alliance to Restore Integrity in Divorce and the National Organization of Women, who daily attended the proceedings. The trial took place in New York State Supreme Court, on Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The prosecution alleged that Garson had an agreement with divorce lawyer Siminovsky whereby the lawyer gave Garson cash, drinks, dinners, and cigars in exchange for courtroom assignments and favored treatment. Videotapes The prosecutors entered into evidence secretly taped video surveillance recordings. In a surveillance videotape made on February 5, 2003, of a private meeting in Garson's chambers, Siminovsky asked Garson if he would award the couple's home to his client, Avraham Levi. Garson responded: \\"I'll award him exclusive use\\". He gave Siminovsky detailed instructions as to how to argue the Levi divorce case before him. He assured Siminovsky that if he followed Garson's instructions: \\"The worst possible scenario is a win ... You're in good shape. You're a winner either way. And your schmuck [Avraham Levi] doesn't deserve it.\\" Garson dictated to Siminovsky the exact language the lawyer should use in a memo to Garson. He urged him to charge his client extra for the memo, saying: \\"I am telling you, charge for it. This is extra; this was not contemplated; the judge made me do it ... Squeeze the guy.\\" Referring to the estranged wife (Sigal Levi), the judge said: \\"She's fucked.\\" Garson also coached Siminovsky as to how to examine a witness regarding the amount of money the wife had earned from a school she operated. He said: > You'll put him on the stand. You go through, 'In evidence is a record book > kept by ba ba boom, there's an average of so many students per month. The > book indicates the approximate rate of $350‚Äì400 a month per student ... ' Garson coached Siminovsky over lunch on February 25, 2003, as to what to have his client say in a case Garson was hearing. With his conversation captured on an audiotape played at the trial, he advised Siminovsky: > Just have [your client] deny a few things. Like, 'Did she give you money > every day to deposit?' 'No.' 'Did she go to the bank every day? She said she > went to the bank every day. Is that true?' 'No.' 'Did you ever, ever take > any cash?' 'Absolutely not.' Romeo y Julieta cigar; Siminovsky gave Garson a box of the Dominican cigars Another recording showed Siminovsky (at this point, part of a sting operation targeting Garson) giving the judge a $250 box of 25 \\"Romeo y Julieta\\" Dominican cigars on March 3, 2010. The cigars were supplied to Siminovsky by the DA's Office. An additional recording showed Siminovsky in the judge's robing room on March 10, 2003. He handed Garson an envelope containing a $1,000 cash \\"referral fee\\". The cash had been supplied to Siminovsky by the DA's Office, as part of the sting operation. Garson initially refused to accept the money. He then tried to return it, suggesting that Siminovsky contribute it to Garson's wife's judicial campaign instead. But Siminovsky threw the money back on the judge's desk, saying he would make a campaign contribution as well, but telling the judge to keep the cash. Garson picked up the money, and tried to hand it to Siminovsky once again, saying \\"I appreciate it. No, no, no ... No.\\" But then, sighing, he put the money in his desk drawer. Siminovsky was instructed by the DA to duck Garson's repeated calls that day and the next, anticipating Garson's attempts to return the money. When Garson was arrested a few days later on his way to work, the envelope containing the sting money was in his pocket. The box of cigars, purchased by the DA's office as part of the sting operation, had been placed in Garson's desk drawer in his robing room by Siminovsky, where they remained unopened and untouched until months later when the DA asked Garson's attorney to retrieve them. The explanation for this was not revealed in court. In another videotaped exchange, they improperly discussed the outcome of a divorce case the lawyer had pending before the judge. Garson assured Siminovsky, saying: \\"You know what? Justice is being done.\\" This was in a case where Garson is heard saying that neither parent was a suitable guardian but that he had no choice. Garson is heard lamenting that Siminovsky's client doesn't deserve it but that the other side didn't have a winning legal position about the shared home. Garson had found that the other side had lied about finances and operation of a daycare center and who had actually paid for the house the family lived in. Segal Levy was a friend of Haminov and had been told about the sting and coached about what to say in court. Other evidence In addition, prosecutors provided financial records as evidence, as well as testimony from Siminovsky. Siminovsky testified that he entertained the judge with lunches, dinners, and drinks, nearly always paying the bill, and gave him money and cigars, in exchange for favorable treatment and 3 more legal assignments than the next highest number of assignments to a lawyer. Siminovsky co-chaired the committee that evaluated and approved attorneys to represent children. The prosecution alleged that before Siminovsky began cooperating with prosecutors, he had already entertained Garson more than 40 times, spending $3,149. The lead prosecutor said that he had asked Garson: \\"Why did you do this with Siminovsky? Why did you take care of him?\\" And that Garson had replied: \\"I like him. And he kind of reminded me of myself.\\" Conviction Garson was convicted in April 2007 of bribery in the third degree, a Class D felony, in violation of New York Penal Law ¬ß 200.10. The jury found that he had accepted thousands of dollars in drinks and meals from Siminovsky in exchange for improperly giving the lawyer advice in a case Siminovsky had before Garson, as well as court-assigned appointments and free access to Garson and \\"showing Siminovsky more courtesy than he did many other lawyers\\". Garson was never accused of \\"fixing\\" cases. Garson was also convicted of two lesser charges, relating to his accepting a box of cigars and $1,000 in cash from Siminovsky for having referred two clients. The charges were for receiving a reward for official misconduct in the second degree (a class E felony; the lowest under New York law, in violation of New York Penal Law ¬ß 200.25). The jury acquitted him on four other counts of receiving rewards for official misconduct in the second degree. Additionally, Garson was automatically disbarred as an attorney as a result of his felony convictions. Sentencing, prison, and release (2007‚Äì09) On June 5, 2007, Justice Berry imposed three consecutive sentences on Garson, which resulted in an aggregate sentence of between 3.5 and 10 years in prison.People v. Garson, \\"Decision & Order\\", Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Second Department, January 5, 2010. Retrieved July 20, 2010. Garson cried in court, and said he was \\"profoundly sorry\\" for his actions. His lawyers pleaded for leniency on the basis of his reported alcoholism, bladder cancer, and other medical conditions. Berry rejected Garson's pleas for leniency, saying: > You should have been beyond reproach. The people of Brooklyn deserve more > from you. You are not some bum. You're an intelligent man. You went to Penn, > and Penn Law School. His lawyer tried to delay his sentence on account of Garson's granddaughter's death, and so he could care for his mentally disabled grown son. He entered an alcohol detoxification program for six days, after which on June 28, 2007, he surrendered at State Supreme Court in Brooklyn to begin serving his sentence. Until May 2009, he was isolated in protective custody at the Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, New York, 180 miles from New York City. From then on, he was in the general population at the Mid-Orange Correctional Facility in Warwick, New York, 60 miles from New York City. Garson was granted an early release from prison, obtaining parole six months before the term of his minimum sentence had run. He was granted parole in his first appearance before the New York State Parole Board, over the DA's Office's strong opposition, and released from a Harlem halfway house on December 23, 2009. He was released early as a result of his completion of a substance abuse program, and good behavior. Conditions of his release included that through June 2017 he abide by curfews set by his probation officer, not associate with any law firms, not drink alcohol, and at the discretion of his parole officer attend an alcohol abuse treatment program and submit to substance abuse testing. A spokesperson for the Parole Board said it was relatively rare for a non- violent felon to receive parole the first time he appeared before the board, as only 21% did so in 2008. If he had been denied parole, he would have had to wait an additional two years before he could re-apply. Garson had also appealed his conviction. But his appeal was denied on January 5, 2010, by the Supreme Court of the State of New York Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department. It opined that the evidence of his guilt was \\"overwhelming\\". Family Garson's second wife is Robin Garson. A Brooklyn Law School graduate, and an election lawyer for the Kings County Democratic Committee (helping eliminate party opponents from the ballot and was a member of the legal team representing DA Hynes in 2001.) and chaired or was a member of several state and local bar committees.

In 1944 many of San Juan's houses were made of adobe and the reconstruction programme prompted the creation of a building code that took into account contemporary knowledge of earthquakes and their effect on buildings. Stronger bricks were used, concrete single-story houses were erected and sidewalks and streets were made wider. Aid and reconstruction The injured are tended to following the collapse of the city hospital There was some debate as to whether it would be advisable to rebuild the city in the same place, or to take advantage of the situation to move it to a less earthquake prone location. The former alternative was adopted. At the start of the reconstruction, emergency homes were built for the population with funds from the national state. This was the first large-scale state-directed construction plan in Argentina, the first stages of which occurred under Peronist rule. Colonel Juan Per√≥n, later to become president, had met his wife Eva Duarte (Evita), during fundraising activities to help the victims. After the 1955 coup d'√©tat ousted Per√≥n, the reconstruction was continued under the de facto President Pedro Eugenio Aramburu. The earthquake caused many families to scatter in the confusion, and left around 1,000 orphaned children. According to historian Mark Healey, the issues surrounding the orphans and the nearly 100,000 homeless had a profound influence on the shaping of social legislation enacted during Per√≥n's first term as president, two years later.Healey, pp. 52‚Äì53Healey, P√°gina 12 interview, August 7, 2006 The modern city As of 2006, San Juan has a population of around 400,000, and 63% of its approximately 90,000 homes, and 100% of its public institutional buildings, were built under seismic safety regulations. This, however, leaves more than a third of houses as non-seismic-resistant. A study of the seismic vulnerability of the city, conducted by the National University of San Juan in 2005, showed that 28% of the outlying neighborhoods present medium risk, and 20% of the city itself can be classified as high or very high vulnerability.

The house is a Grade II* listed building and the estate is Grade I listed on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. Originally built in the 16th century, the house was used as the headquarters of the British 8th Corps in the Second World War. Somerset County Council assumed ownership in 1951 and use the property as an administrative centre. Hestercombe House served as the Emergency Call Centre for the Somerset Area of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service until March 2012. Hestercombe House is surrounded by gardens which have been restored to Gertrude Jekyll's original plans (1904‚Äì07) and have made it \\"one of the best Jekyll-Lutyens gardens open to the public on a regular basis\\", visited by approximately 70,000 people per year. The site also includes a 0.08 hectare (8,600 sq ft) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset, notified in 2000. The site is used as a roost site by Lesser horseshoe bats. Location Hestercombe House is between West Monkton and Cheddon Fitzpaine in the Taunton Deane area in the south of the English county of Somerset. It is on the Quantock Hills which were England‚Äôs first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty being designated in 1956. The south facing gardens offer views of the Blackdown Hills. History In the 11th century Hestercombe was owned by Glastonbury Abbey. Sir John Meriet founded a chantry in the 14th century and in 1392 it passed to John La Ware by marriage and stayed in his family for almost four hundred years. The current house is a Grade II* listed country house which was originally built in the 16th century for the Warre family. Sir Richard Warre (d. 1601) bequeathed it to his son Roger who married Elinor, daughter of Sir John Popham. When their descendant Sir Francis Warre, Bt. died in 1718 he left the estate to his daughter, Margaret, who transferred it to her husband John Bampfylde (1691‚Äì1750). Following his death in 1750 it was inherited by the couple's son, Coplestone Warre Bampfylde, a landscape painter who developed pleasure grounds to the north of the house incorporating cascades, lakes and a series of ornamental structures. The house was enlarged and altered in the 18th century, but this work is no longer visible beneath the refronting and enlargement works carried out around 1875 for Edward Portman, 1st Viscount Portman, who had acquired it in 1873. Second World War Remains of barracks block in the grounds During the early years of the Second World War, the house and gardens were used by the British Army as part of the headquarters for VIII Corps, which was formed to command the defence of Somerset, Devon, Cornwall and Bristol. The VIII Corps main headquarters was at nearby Pyrland Hall, and the rear headquarters established at Hestercombe House, with Personnel and Logistics staff. Hestercombe was the headquarters of the American army 398th General Service Engineer Regiment from July 1943 to April 1944. Eisenhower visited Hestercombe on 18 March 1944 to meet General Gerow and inspect the troops. The Engineers were joined by the 19th District Headquarters of the US Supply Services in July 1943, which stayed until July 1944. Early on 28 March 1944, a few minutes after midnight, a Junkers Ju 88 crashed on the drive to the house after being shot down by cannon fire from a de Havilland Mosquito of No. 219 Squadron Royal Air Force. Hestercombe was the American 801 Hospital Centre after the Normandy landings until the end of the war. A total of 33 barrack huts (various Nissen huts, Romney huts and MOWB (Ministry of Works brick huts) were constructed at Hestercombe during the war. Many were demolished in the 1960s by the Crown Estate, and only one is left standing, in Rook Wood. Post war The 'Great Plat', with the Pergola beyond The house remained in the Portman family until 1944 when it was accepted in lieu of death duties by the Crown Estate, however Mrs Portman remained at the house until her death in 1951. It was leased to the fire service in 1953. A visitor centre opened in the Victorian stables in 2005. Most of the cost of the conversion was funded by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The house was used as the Emergency Call Centre for the Somerset Area of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service with a running cost in 2011 of ¬£675,000 per year. The fire service moved out in 2012 and restoration work was then undertaken. The house today appears an assemblage of several architectural styles popular during the Victorian era. While the overall design and air could be described as Italianate, also present in the same entrance facade are examples of high Victorian Gothic, such as an Italianate seigneurial tower confused in design with a campanile tower. This tower complete with a glazed loggia is crowned by a French-style mansard roof with oversized chimneys masquerading as Renaissance ornament. The centrepiece of the same facade is a porte-coch√®re designed in a heavy neoclassical style. Watermill and dynamo house Watermill and dynamo house In the 18th century a watermill was installed and used to power a sawmill, grind corn and crush apples. There is some evidence that there has been a mill on the site since the late 14th century. The overshot waterwheel, which was in diameter and wide overall, was replaced in 1895, when the attached barn and workshops were expanded. and generated electricity for the estate, which was stored in glass batteries. The waterwheel had deteriorated by the 1980s. From the 1950s until 2009 the buildings were used as a barn for animals and agricultural machinery. It has since been restored and had a biomass boiler installed. During the restoration an unexplained series of unusual pipework was discovered in the floor of the building. The building now acts as a visitor centre, which includes access to the dynamo room where acetylene gas was produced along with a thermalume generator which produced gas from petrol and air. Gardens When the house and gardens were inherited by Coplestone Warre Bampfylde (1720‚Äì91) in the 18th century, a Georgian landscape garden was laid out, containing ponds, a grand cascade, a gothic alcove, a Tuscan temple arbour (1786), and a folly mausoleum. Bampfylde was an amateur architect of talent and a friend and adviser to Henry Hoare who laid out the gardens at Stourhead. Bampfylde also designed a Doric temple for the grounds, which was built around 1786, with an ashlar tetrastyle prostyle fronted by Tuscan columns and a large modillioned pediment. A Victorian formal parterre was added near the house by Henry Hall in the 1870s. The Edwardian garden was laid out by Gertrude Jekyll and Edwin Lutyens between 1904 and 1906 for the Hon E.W.B. Portman, resulting in a garden \\"remarkable for the bold, concise pattern of its layout, and for the minute attention to detail everywhere to be seen in the variety and imaginative handling of contrasting materials, whether cobble, tile, flint, or thinly coursed local stone\\". Jekyll and Lutyens were leading participants of the Arts and Crafts movement. Jekyll is remembered for her outstanding designs and subtle, painterly approach to the arrangement of the gardens she created, particularly her \\"hardy flower borders\\". Jekyll was one of the first of her profession to take into account the colour, texture, and experience of gardens as the prominent authorities in her designs, and she was a lifelong fan of plants of all genres. Her theory of how to design with colour was influenced by painter J. M. W. Turner and by impressionism, and by the theoretical colour wheel. Their collaborative style was first developed at Herstercombe and described by the garden writer and designer Penelope Hobhouse as: The \\"Great Plat\\" combined the patterned features of a parterre with the hardy herbaceous planting espoused by Miss Jekyll. Lutyens also designed the orangery about 50 m east of the main house between 1904‚Äì09, which is now Grade I listed, as are the garden walls, paving and steps on the south front of the house. On either side of the Great Plat are raised terraces with brick water channels. In his 2018 BBC series Paradise Gardens, Monty Don suggested that the garden had many features of the traditional Islamic Paradise Garden. The eastern area is laid out as a Dutch garden laid out with perennial plants such as Large white flowering Yucca gloriosa as groups used vertical elements alternate with purple colored flowering dwarf Lavender (Lavandula), catmint (Nepeta) or silvery colored Zieste (Stachys), Cotton lavender (Santolina), China Rose (Rosa chinensis) or Fuchsia (Fuchsia magellanica). Since October 2003, the landscape and gardens, extending to over , have been managed by the Hestercombe Gardens Trust, a registered charity set up to restore and preserve the site with a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of ¬£3.7M. The gardens featured on BBC TV's Gardens Through Time series, and cover more than , with three different styles of garden ranging from woodland walks to lakes and ponds to formal gardens. The Georgian landscape, Victorian shrubbery and terrace and the formal Edwardian gardens combine to create biodiversity and interest for visitors. The site is used by Lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros) as both a breeding and wintering roost site. Numbers of Lesser Horseshoes at this site are only exceeded by one other site in southwest England. The bats use roofspaces in a former stable block as a maternity site. It has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).

Raven was a co-founder of numerous feminist art organizations in Los Angeles in the 1970s. Life and work Arlene Raven's parents were Joseph and Annette Rubin, middle-class Jewish-American parents, in Baltimore, Maryland. Joseph Rubin Obituary, Baltimore Sun, 20 August 2014. Note that Joseph Rubin's obituary lists Arlene as a decedent family member, but spells the last name \\"Ravan\\". Her father was a bar owner, and her mother a homemaker. Raven earned an Artium Baccalaureatus from Hood College in Maryland in 1965, then went on to complete graduate study. She earned an MFA in painting from George Washington University and completed a PhD in art history from Johns Hopkins University in 1975. Raven was a major figure in the Feminist Art Movement and was part of an effort to educate women artists and provide them with opportunities to make and show work that was specifically about their experiences as women. In 1973, Raven co-founded the Feminist Studio Workshop with Judy Chicago and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville. The goal of the Feminist Studio Workshop, an independent art school ultimately housed in the Los Angeles Woman's Building, was to \\"come together as a community of working individuals whose work grows out of our shared experiences as women and our shared social context,\\" and an emphasis was put on \\"cooperation, collaboration, and sisterhood.\\" That same year, Raven co-founded The Center for Feminist Art Historical Studies with fellow Johns Hopkins-educated art historian Ruth Iskin. The Center was dedicated to serious research on women artists, developing a feminist art historical methodology, and creating a slide archive of work by women. Raven also co-founded and edited the women's culture magazine Chrysalis. In 1976, she was a founding member of The Lesbian Art Project; she herself was a lesbian as well. Members explored lesbianism through artwork, researched lesbian artists of the past, such as the painter Romaine Brooks, and questioned the cultural meaning of the very term \\"lesbian.\\" She was also a founder of the Women‚Äôs Caucus for Art. In addition to the Feminist Studio Workshop, Raven also taught at the California Institute of the Arts, Maryland Institute College of Art, Parsons The New School for Design, UCLA, University of Southern California and The New School for Social Research. In the 1980s she became the chief art critic for the Village Voice. She curated ten exhibitions, including ones for the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Long Beach Museum of Art. One notable exhibition was \\"At Home,\\" \\"which brought together many of the artists and ideas she had championed for the previous decade.\\" In 2000, Raven became critic-in-residence at the Rinehart School of Sculpture at the Maryland Institute College of Art. In 2002, she received the Frank Jewett Mather Award for art criticism from the College Art Association. Raven died of cancer at her home in Brooklyn, New York on August 1, 2006, aged 62. She was survived by her father, her sister Phyllis [Gelman], and Nancy Grossman, her life partner of 23 years.

She made her first appearance on 25 December 2001. She was played by both Annelise Manojlovic from birth in 2001 until 2015, and Jemma Giles from her birth in 2001 until 2002. The role was recast in 2016 to Rosie Bentham. Bentham took a break from the series in 2017 to sit her GCSEs, departing on 17 April 2017. Gabby made her on-screen return on 22 September 2017. Gabby is the daughter of Ashley Thomas (John Middleton) and Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles), the stepdaughter of Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) and Lawrence White (John Bowe) and half-sister to Arthur Thomas (Alfie Clarke) and Dotty Thomas. Gabby's storylines have included her mother Bernice re-entering her life, dealing with her father and stepmother's break up and them eventually reconciling, learning that Ashley has dementia, her teenage rebellion, her friendship with Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele) and her crush on Jacob Gallagher (Joe-Warren Plant). Storylines Gabby is born on Christmas Day 2001, with her paternity in doubt. Her mother, Bernice, had an affair with Carlos Diaz (Gary Turner), the chef at The Woolpack where she was landlady, at the time Gabby was conceived. However, a DNA test reveals Ashley to be the father and he forgives Bernice and the family reunite. However, Bernice does not take to motherhood easily, and decides to leave the village in 2002. Gabby occasionally visits her mother, who later remarries a man named Charlie and has a second daughter, Dee Dee Willis.

Months later it is discovered that Daniel was not the Thomas' biological son, due to a baby swap in hospital. Their biological son is Arthur Doland (Alfie Clarke). The stress of this causes Gabby to lean more on her grandfather, Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower), as Ashley and Laurel briefly separate. In June 2008, a court decides that Arthur should go to his natural parents, and Ashley and Laurel take him home. Gabby finds this difficult, and drops Arthur off in front of the house of Greg (Shaun Prendergast) and Mel Doland (Caroline Strong). Eventually, she is taken to a psychiatrist, who finds out that Gabby was afraid she was switched at birth and would be replaced. She soon bonds with Arthur. When Sally Spode (Si√¢n Reeves) arrived, Gabby was always sent to her bedroom, so she could not see Laurel. At the end of Sally's scheming Gabby became upset.

Bernice tells Gabby the reason there was an atmosphere with Emma is because Ashley witnessed Emma on the bridge during a car crash and Arthur watched a video with Ashley confronting Emma, which she destroyed. Gabby warns Emma to stay away from her family and comforts Laurel. Emma blames Laurel for leaving a prayer card of Ashley's on James Barton's (Bill Ward) grave, but it was Gabby. Gabby spooks Emma in the church by pretending she is God, but Emma finds Gabby's necklace and Gabby breaks into Emma's house to retrieve it. Gabby also finds the memory card and she and Arthur try it out, surprised that it works after being damaged and Gabby witnesses Emma and Ashley's video. Gabby and Arthur play the footage of Emma and Ashley in the church and when Emma catches Gabby, they physically fight and Gabby pushes Emma onto a stone. When Emma Barton is found dead by a viaduct, she is believed to have been murdered and Emma's son, Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan), suspects Gabby and Pete attempts to talk to Gabby. After Gabby is snappy towards Arthur and Bernice is informed of her truancy, Bernice finds Gabby drinking alcohol and Pete watches on as Bernice reprimands Gabby. Upon her return, Frank Clayton (Michael Praed) lets slip to Laurel that Gabby bought roses, assuming they were for her. After Pete witnesses the discussion, he confronts Gabby in front of her family about roses found at the viaduct with an apology note. Gabby denies murdering Emma, but left the roses for the way she treated Emma and Gabby overhears Bernice and Laurel questioning the possibility of Gabby being capable of murder. Gabby is picked up by the police when she attempts to hitchhike and with Bernice present, she is questioned about Emma's murder and she hands in the memory card with the video of Ashley and Emma. Dee Dee (Mia Gibson-Reed) arrives unannounced in Emmerdale and reunites with Bernice, Gabby and Diane. Bernice and Gabby admit to Diane they exaggerated their life to make it seem glamorous to Dee Dee. Bernice buys Gabby and Dee Dee gifts, but when Bernice comes clean about not being rich, Dee Dee decides to return to Australia. Gabby is not happy when Bernice starts a relationship with Daz Spencer (Mark Jordon) and she blackmails alcohol out of him. On Valentine's Day, Liv arranges to meet Jacob at the pavilion on Gabby's behalf and Liv tells Gabby that she is asexual, but kisses Gabby to ensure she is not lesbian. Gabby is infuriated with Liv when she witnesses Jacob and Liv hugging and on her 16th birthday, Gabby gives Liv a henna tattoo and at her party, it is revealed the tattoo says skank. Gabby angrily tells everyone that Liv stole Jacob off her and kissed her. Liv refuses to forgive Gabby, but make up after a fight. For a party, Gabby gets Liv to steal vodka from the pub when she fails to blackmail some out of Daz, who tells Bernice about Gabby and alcohol. Gabby takes ketamine from Vanessa Woodfield's (Michelle Hardwick) bag and Gabby encourages Liv to spike Daz's drink when he talks negatively about Liv, however, Lisa Dingle (Jane Cox) has the drink and suffers a heart attack. Gabby takes responsibility for spiking the drink when the police turn up at the hospital and she is arrested and charged with theft and administering a noxious substance, but when she is caught by her family writing a message to Liv, she admits Liv was involved, but will not implicate her. Liv confesses to being responsible for spiking the drink and is charged, but Gabby still is charged with theft. To make up for stealing ketamine, Gabby decides to work at the vets for free. Casting From the character's birth, Gabby was played by both Annelise Manojlovic and Jemma Giles, however, Manojlovic continued as Gabby until 2015. The character was recast to Rosie Bentham and she appeared from January 2016. Of her casting, Bentham said, \\"I was out shopping with my mate when I found out I'd got the role. I was jumping around in Boots. It was amazing. I went up to Leeds four times because of call backs. I knew I was down to the last five but I wasn't really expecting to get it. It was incredible when I found out. It's a bit weird, but I had been watching Gabby before I started going up there to see what I could find out about her character.\\" Bentham stated that Lucy Pargeter, who plays Chas Dingle and James Hooton, who plays Sam Dingle, helped her as they attended Television Workshop \\"They were both excited when I told them I was from Television Workshop. I couldn't wish for better people to work with. It sounds like a cliche but we're all one big family.\\" She also added \\"It was a bit of a shock for people when I first appeared as Gabby. It happens a lot in television and people get used to it. I just took it as 'I'm not playing this character' and didn't really think about whatever had happened in the past.\\" Bentham is chaperoned by her parents. Development=Early development In 2012, Giles reprised her role of Bernice. Giles said that Bernice will think Gabby will \\"enjoy spending time\\" with her, but will have thought little about the \\"hard time\\" Gabby has endured with Ashley and Laurel's marriage breakdown. Bernice's return will worry Laurel over the \\"affect\\" it will have on her relationship with Gabby. Upon Laurel embarking a relationship with Marlon, Gabby takes \\"a real dislike\\" to Marlon as she views him as the one who has ruined her family, so she claims Marlon assaulted her when an \\"upset\\" Gabby witnesses Laurel and Marlon kissing. Bellamy said Laurel is \\"very upset\\" when Gabby admits to making up to assault and chooses to live with Ashley as Lauren views Gabby as her own daughter, who would \\"happily accept\\" Laurel as her mum again if Ashley and Laurel reunite. Ashley's dementia and death In 2015, it was announced Middleton would be leaving Emmerdale with Ashley being diagnosed with dementia. Ashley \\"desperately tried to put off\\" the \\"terrible prospect\\" of telling Gabby and Arthur the truth. Bellamy explained the \\"sad\\" scene where Ashley tells the children over a picnic. When a \\"wayward\\" Gabby breaks into Victoria's house, resulting in her being injured, and steals Sandy's pension, she \\"hatches a cruel plan against\\" Ashley when he reports her for robbery by reporting him for assault. The allegation causes a \\"rift\\" between Gabby and Ashley as Ashley will not apologise and Gabby is \\"determined not to back down either.\\" Gabby is \\"devastated\\" when she feels \\"denied\\" of the \\"chance to say goodbye\\" to Ashley privately when he dies. Producer Iain MacLeod said, despite the \\"crushing extra blow\\" for Gabby that was \\"added in to make the story more realistic\\", that throughout Gabby's \\"journey\\", she will come to realise that Ashley knew she loved him. With the suggestion Gabby go \\"off the roles\\", MacLeod confirmed it was not the \\"intention\\" as they do not want to \\"inflict any undue anguish on her, it just felt quite truthful.\\" Middleton praised Bentham, calling her \\"a lovely young woman\\" and that he is \\"proud\\" of her and Clarke as \\"they‚Äôve developed so brilliantly.\\" Reception In episodes broadcast in February 2016, Gabby was seen drawing on a Scouse brow with permanent marker as part of her under-age drinking storyline. Many viewers took to social media to ridicule Gabby's look, despite the serious nature of plot. A columnist for Inside Soap commented, \\"Gabby Thomas isn't a bad girl, but she really ought to think twice before listening to sneaky Lachlan.\\" Duncan Lindsay from Metro praised Bentham and her on-screen family for the portrayal of Ashley's dementia, saying their performances \\"continue to be outstanding\\". For her portrayal as Gabby, Bentham was nominated at the 2016 TV Choice Awards for Best Soap Newcomer.

Peter wins free maid service for a week; he intentionally creates extra work for the maid, Joan. Quagmire meets her and instantly falls in love with her, leading him to propose to her after the second date. After the marriage, Quagmire comes to regret his new relationship, but learns that Joan will kill him and herself if he leaves her, so he fakes his own death. The episode was written by Tom Maxwell, Don Woodard and Steve Callaghan and directed by Seth Kearsley. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.06 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Adam Carolla, Stephan Cox, Bryan Cranston, Darrel Heath, Beth Littleford, Christy Carlson Romano, Nicole Sullivan, Fred Tatasciore, Alex Thomas, and Alex Trebek, as well as several recurring voice actors for the series. Plot Peter is a contestant on Wheel of Fortune, advances to the bonus round, and wins, despite choosing Z, 4, three Qs, and the Batman symbol for his consonants and vowel, and taking a self-described \\"shot in the dark\\" with his answer, \\"Alex Karras in Webster\\", managing to get the correct answer on his first try, to Pat's absolute shock (whom Peter believes is Regis Philbin). He chooses, among several other prizes, one week of free maid service. When his maid Joan arrives, Peter has her pull items out of his belly button (including, among other things, a ColecoVision set and a carton of Parliament Cigarettes to the shock of Peter, who says he hasn't smoked in ten years), and rides on her back, like a horse, to the store. Peter decides to over-work Joan on her last night by giving Meg a watermelon filled with chocolate pudding and M-80 firecrackers, which explodes in her face. After being introduced to her by Peter, Quagmire falls in love with her. After dating Joan, Quagmire proposes marriage to her, which she accepts and the couple prepare their marriage ceremony. Lois, Peter and their neighbors visit Quagmire's house, finding that he has changed his personality significantly. Peter still believes this to be a prank and shows Quagmire porn magazines in an attempt to change him back to his former ways. Meanwhile, Lois begins to question whether she should keep breastfeeding Stewie, as he is hurting her when feeding. By the time of Quagmire's wedding, Lois' breasts have gotten very large after deciding to wean Stewie, on the advice of Brian. While at the reception, the top of her shirt rips open. Peter notices that Quagmire is staring at Lois' huge breasts, and deliberately spills champagne on them. Peter then \\"helps\\" Lois by shaking her, which makes her large breasts jiggle. This arouses Quagmire, and he realizes that he has made a mistake by marrying Joan. He informs Joan that some of his friends think they should get an annulment after discussing it with Peter, Joe and Cleveland, but she threatens to cut herself and him if he annuls their marriage. As a result, Peter decides to help Quagmire fake his death. He shows Joan a video of Quagmire being attacked by a ninja (Joe), a Nazi (Cleveland), a \\"pots and pans\\" robot (Peter), and the body being consumed by a dinosaur held by Peter (to the theme of Jurassic Park). Joan is unconvinced by the video. Peter and his friends then operate plan B, which consists of Quagmire pretending to suffer a heart attack and die. Quagmire is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him a short period of time so Peter can return after the funeral has finished and dig him up. However, when Mayor West announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete (to guard against zombies), Peter exclaims that Quagmire is not dead, and brings him out of the coffin, alive. Death shows up to retrieve his body. Joan pleads for Quagmire's life, and touches Death's arm, which kills her instantly. Death takes Joan instead, as \\"she was suicidal and her last name was Quagmire.\\" However, before he leaves, Quagmire asks Death to leave the body for another five minutes, thus turning him back into his old usual self. Meanwhile, Stewie has been having drug-like withdrawals since Lois decided to wean him. He becomes so desperate that when he and Lois are at the park, he jumps on a woman breastfeeding her baby and greedily suckles on her, but is pulled off by Lois. One night, he then tries to milk Lois in her sleep. He pumps her breasts and succeeds, but spills and desperately tries licking it up. Stewie realizes how pathetic he is and accepts his weaning. He comes to Brian and informs that he is now off breast milk, but Lois has other plans. Lois allows Stewie to be breastfed again, thus delighting him. Production Steve Callaghan wrote the episode, along with Tom Maxwell and Don Woodard. \\"I Take Thee Quagmire\\" is the only episode of Family Guy that Maxwell and Woodard wrote. This episode starts by depicting the game show Wheel of Fortune. When Brian is watching Malcolm in the Middle on television, a scene begins showing the mother of the fictional family screaming at the children and father. Jane Kaczmarek was asked to do the voice as she was the original actor in the series; however, she refused. MacFarlane said that he gets a message that Kaczmarek wishes to portray that character as likable, and does not wish to jeopardize that. The father during that scene was voiced by Bryan Cranston, the original actor in the series, who accepted the role. Seth MacFarlane comments that \\"this is the first real Quagmire story we've ever done.\\" A scene was made of Stewie attending a meeting similar to those at Alcoholics Anonymous; however, the meeting was designed for those who are too addicted to breast milk. The format of Wheel of Fortune is somewhat similar to the layout of the modern-day program, but the scene also features several aspects which are now no longer broadcast, such as not automatically being given R, S, T, L, N, and E, and were featured in the 1980s. Two scenes during this episode were censored for television broadcasting. When Quagmire meets Joan and invites her out on a date, Cleveland asks, \\"Is that a banana in your pocket, or an erection in your pocket?\\" Although this entire scene was not censored, Fox Broadcasting Company bleeped \\"erection\\", which, according to DVD commentary, made what Cleveland said sound worse than what was intended. The scene where Peter is promoting 'Crystal Pepsi' was shown only on the DVD, because it is prohibited to promote one product over another on television. There is also a scene after the watermelon exploding trick where Meg was supposed to say \\"Fuck you, asshole! I'll kick your ass to hell!\\", but Fox also censored the line and was replaced by \\"I hate you! I hate you!\\" instead. In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Adam Carolla, actor Stephan Cox, actor Bryan Cranston, actor Darrel Heath, actress Beth Littleford, actress Christy Carlson Romano, voice actress Nicole Sullivan, voice actor Fred Tatasciore, actor Alex Thomas, and game show host Alex Trebek guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actors Ralph Garman, Mike Henry, writer Danny Smith, actress Jennifer Tilly, and writer John Viener made minor appearances in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Patrick Warburton and Adam West made appearances in the episode as well. Cultural references In the opening scene of the episode, Peter is shown playing on the gameshow Wheel of Fortune, with hosts Pat Sajak and Vanna White also appearing. When Mayor West is playing as a contestant on Jeopardy!, he spells the name of the host, Alex Trebek, backwards (Kebert Xela), sending him back to the fifth dimension; this is a reference to when DC Comics supervillain and nemesis to Superman, Mister Mxyzptlk, is sent to the fifth dimension when someone makes him say his own name backwards. A Family Guy fan later did this in a real life episode of Jeopardy!Show #5255, aired 2007-06-15 J! Archive When Peter and the children are flying through space and singing, this is a reference to The Great Space Coaster. The two Asian men who meet Peter at the traffic lights when riding Joan's back speak in a very similar tone to Howard Cosell, a reference to the 1985 cult film Better Off Dead. When Quagmire fantasizes about being alone in the forest with Joan and speaking to her in Elvish, this is a reference to a scene from The Lord of the Rings; Quagmire goes on to imagine himself with Joan dancing dressed as the title characters from Beauty and the Beast, eating a plate of spaghetti similar to that shown in Lady and the Tramp, and flying on a magic carpet dressed as Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. They also fly through Baghdad which is in ruins from the US/British invasion. Adam West's response to seeing the Statue of Liberty is taken from the original Planet of the Apes. Also, there is a scene where Brian watches Malcolm in the Middle. In the scene, Lois nags the boys so much that she will go on strike, so Hal ends up killing her with a refrigerator door and walks away blissfully with the boys. Twice during the episode Quagmire engraves his name with his nose much like Woody Woodpecker. In the end, he engraves \\"giggity giggity goo\\" in the same fashion. Reception Bob Sassone of TV Squad commented that \\"this episode had one of the more hysterical/disturbing images of this TV season: Lois flashing her breasts to Brian after giving Stewie his lunch.\\"Television News, Reviews and TV Show Recaps - HuffPost TV Michael Drucker of IGN noted that \\"the volume four episodes are easily funnier than the volume three ones\\", referring to the episode.Family Guy ‚Äì Volume Four, Drucker, Michael.

It is based on the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), who played for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1976 to 1978 with the help of his coach, Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear). The film was released in the United States on August 25, 2006. Plot In the 1970s, Philadelphia is in chaos as southern portions of the city protest the shutdown of several job sites while their NFL team, the Philadelphia Eagles, endures a string of losing seasons. In 1976, substitute teacher Vince Papale goes to a sandlot one night and joins his friends playing a pick-up football game against another group of young men. After the game ends, Papale goes home and finds his wife Sharon disgusted with his failure to provide proper support. The next morning, Papale is unexpectedly laid off from his job at the school. That night, Papale goes to the bar where he works as a part-time bartender. The bar contains die-hard Eagles fans, who are watching a TV report on Eagles hiring a new head coach, Dick Vermeil, who will be staging open public tryouts for the Eagles; the bar regulars encourage Papale to attend the tryout. Returning home, Papale finds out that Sharon has left him, leaving him a note saying he will never be anything in the world. Distraught, Papale trashes the few remaining belongings that she left behind. The next night at the bar, Papale meets a new co-bartender, Janet Cantrell, who is a Giants fan. Desperate for income in the aftermath of his wife's departure, Papale receives support from his friends and attends the tryout hosted at Veterans Stadium. Papale is competing against several hundred Philadelphia residents, but performs well during the workouts. After the tryouts, Dick Vermeil comes by as Papale is trying to start his car. Vermeil is impressed by Papale's performance and invites him to training camp to compete for a roster spot with the Eagles. Accepting, Papale receives a warm welcome at the bar, and has an interview with a newscaster. The next day, Papale is jogging in the city and stops by his empty home; running into friends, he tells them about joining the Eagles. His father, meanwhile, offers to let Vince stay with him. The following day, he goes to his first training camp with the Eagles. As the days of training camp progress, Papale endures hard training and disrespect from other players. One night, Papale takes Janet out on a date. He is unsure if he can start a new relationship, since he needs to try his best to make the team. Janet claims that she did not know it was a date. She goes back to work and he leaves. As training camp ends, the final roster spot is down to Papale and a veteran. Against his assistants' advice, Vermeil lands the final spot to Papale. As Papale's career with the Eagles begins, the team loses all six preseason games and their regular season opener against the Dallas Cowboys. Papale plays poorly against the Cowboys, and Vermeil faces pressure from the fans and media. After the team returns to Philadelphia, Papale goes to the sandlot where he played with his friends once before. He is invited to play, but he declines because of his upcoming Eagles game and watches for a few minutes. However, as a rainstorm begins, Papale joins his pals and plays against another sandlot team to help his friends. He ends the wet and dirty game by throwing a touchdown pass. When he runs into Janet later, they speak briefly before passionately embracing and tumbling into Papale's home. During the home opener against the New York Giants, Janet's appearance in a Giants shirt angers the Eagles fans. In the locker room, Papale looks again at the note Sharon had left and tears it up. He opens the game by solo-tackling the kickoff returner inside the fifteen-yard line. After an up-and-down game, Papale gets downfield during an Eagles' fourth quarter punt to tackle the returner, forcing a fumble that he recovers and takes into the end zone for a touchdown, giving the Eagles their first win in Papale's career. Eagles fans go wild with joy. During the end credits, media highlights of Papale's career with the Eagles are shown. Papale plays for the team for three seasons and eventually marries Janet while Vermeil succeeds in turning the Eagles into a winning team, culminating in an appearance in Super Bowl XV.

He then played with the semi-pro Aston Green Knights of the Seaboard Football League and two seasons with the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League, one of the NFL's rival leagues on the level of the AFL and the USFL. Papale was a standout special teams star for the Bell, who played at Philadelphia's JFK Stadium. Mark Wahlberg was shorter (5'8\\") than Vince Papale, who stood at 6'2\\" while playing for the Eagles. Mark Wahlberg was closer to Vince Papale's high-school height of 5'7\\". Vince Papale's first wife did leave him, leaving a similar note. However, that happened in 1971, five years before the events of the movie. The movie portrays Vince meeting Janet before the tryouts. In real life, Papale dated and married his second wife, Sandy during the movie's time frame. He was divorced and met Janet after his Eagles career as the couple married in 1993. Papale did participate in an open tryout before earning his spot on the Bell roster, which the filmmakers used as a model for the tryout shown in the movie. For the Eagles, Papale actually participated in a private workout that was by invitation only. The opening scene of the movie features the Eagles' 31‚àí0 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on December 7, 1975. One of the fans makes a comment that the Eagles lost to a team worse than they were. In 1975, the Bengals actually went 11‚Äì3 and were the wild card team in the AFC. The game versus the New York Giants is depicted as being a close defensive struggle, with the Giants scoring first to take a 7‚Äì0 lead. The Eagles actually won easily, 20‚Äì7, with the Giants not scoring until late in the game. The fumble recovery depicted in the climactic scene did occur, but Papale's touchdown did not count, under NFL rules at the time, since the ball could not be advanced. It was still a key play in the victory for the Eagles. Papale never scored a regular-season touchdown in the NFL. His only offensive stat came in the 1977 season, where he had 1 catch for 15 yards. However, he scored his first NFL touchdown against the Patriots in a 1977 exhibition game. As with so many of his breaks, this was a big one‚Äîthe game-winning score. Rookie Quarterback Mike Cordova threw from the Pats' 14, and Cornerback Raymond Clayborn deflected the ball slightly allowing Papale to make a diving catch in the end zone. Filming The preseason/tryout scenes were filmed at Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania, and the Central High School Lancers field during July and August 2005. (For 13 seasons, 1958‚Äì1970, Franklin Field was the home field of the Eagles.) The crew used their locker room and field. The Lancers, who had a preseason, used Fairmount Park in West Philadelphia during this time. The office scenes were filmed in Delaplaine McDaniel Middle School, During renovations to the school at 1801 Moore street South Philadelphia. The carnival scenes were filmed at Our Lady of Mount Carmel School in South Philadelphia at 2329 South Third Street. Some of the street scenes were filmed on location in the city. The remainder of the film was filmed in a former aircraft carrier parts warehouse on Langley Avenue in the Philadelphia Naval Business Center. The crew shared this facility with the floats for the Philadelphia Thanksgiving Day Parade. The film opens with Jim Croce's \\"I Got a Name\\". Box office In opening weekend the movie made approximately $17,031,122 domestically. The movie generated an estimated $57,806,952 domestically. Reception The film received generally positive reviews from critics. It is certified \\"fresh\\" with a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has an average rating of 6.46/10, based on 135 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"As simple and authentic as the gritty South Philly invirons in which it's set in, Invincible sends a uplifting and heartfelt message packed with an athletic enthusiasm that shouldn't be missed\\". On Metacritic, the film reached a score of 63 based on 28 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Common Sense Media gave the film 4 out of 5 stars.

Chlordiazepoxide has a medium to long half-life but its active metabolite has a very long half- life. The drug has amnesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Chlordiazepoxide was patented in 1958 and approved for medical use in 1960. It was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized and the discovery of chlordiazepoxide was by pure chance. Chlordiazepoxide and other benzodiazepines were initially accepted with widespread public approval but were followed with widespread public disapproval and recommendations for more restrictive medical guidelines for its use. Medical uses Chlordiazepoxide is indicated for the short-term (2-4 weeks) treatment of anxiety that is severe and disabling or subjecting the person to unacceptable distress. It is also indicated as a treatment for the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It can sometimes be prescribed to ease symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome combined with clidinium bromide as a fixed dose medication, Librax. Contraindications Use of chlordiazepoxide should be avoided in individuals with the following conditions: * Myasthenia gravis * Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances * Ataxia * Severe hypoventilation * Acute narrow-angle glaucoma * Severe liver deficiencies (hepatitis and liver cirrhosis decrease elimination by a factor of 2) * Severe sleep apnea * Hypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the benzodiazepine class Chlordiazepoxide is generally considered an inappropriate benzodiazepine for the elderly due to its long elimination half-life and the risks of accumulation. Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, pregnancy, children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Pregnancy The research into the safety of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is limited and it is recommended that use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy should be based on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. If chlordiazepoxide is used during pregnancy the risks can be reduced via using the lowest effective dose and for the shortest time possible. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are considered to be among the safer benzodiazepines to use during pregnancy in comparison to other benzodiazepines. Possible adverse effects from benzodiazepine use during pregnancy include, abortion, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, functional deficits, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Caution is also advised during breast feeding as chlordiazepoxide passes into breast milk. Adverse effects Sedative drugs and sleeping pills, including chlordiazepoxide, have been associated with an increased risk of death. The studies had many limitations: possibly tending to overestimate risk, such as possible confounding by indication with other risk factors; confusing hypnotics with drugs having other indications; Common side-effects of chlordiazepoxide include: * Confusion * Constipation * Drowsiness * Fainting * Altered sex drive * Liver problems * Lack of muscle coordination * Minor menstrual irregularities * Nausea * Skin rash or eruptions * Swelling due to fluid retention * Yellow eyes and skin Chlordiazepoxide in laboratory mice studies impairs latent learning. Benzodiazepines impair learning and memory via their action on benzodiazepine receptors, which causes a dysfunction in the cholinergic neuronal system in mice. It was later found that scopolamine impairment in learning was caused by an increase in benzodiazapine/GABA activity (and that benzodiazepines were not associated with the cholinergic system). In tests of various benzodiazepine compounds, chlordiazepoxide was found to cause the most profound reduction in the turnover of 5HT (serotonin) in rats. Serotonin is closely involved in regulating mood and may be one of the causes of feelings of depression in rats using chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines. frame In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. Tolerance and dependenceTolerance= Chronic use of benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide, leads to the development of tolerance, with a decrease in number of benzodiazepine binding sites in mouse forebrain. The Committee of Review of Medicines, who carried out an extensive review of benzodiazepines including chlordiazepoxide, found‚Äîand were in agreement with the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the conclusions of a study carried out by the White House Office of Drug Policy and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (USA)‚Äîthat there was little evidence that long-term use of benzodiazepines were beneficial in the treatment of insomnia due to the development of tolerance. Benzodiazepines tended to lose their sleep-promoting properties within 3-14 days of continuous use, and in the treatment of anxiety the committee found that there was little convincing evidence that benzodiazepines retained efficacy in the treatment of anxiety after 4 months' continuous use due to the development of tolerance. =Dependence= Chlordiazepoxide can cause physical dependence and what is known as the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those seen with alcohol and barbiturates. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible through a slow and gradual dose- reduction regime. Chlordiazepoxide taken during pregnancy can cause a postnatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Overdose An individual who has consumed excess chlordiazepoxide may display some of the following symptoms: * Somnolence (difficulty staying awake) * Mental confusion * Hypotension * Hypoventilation * Impaired motor functions ** Impaired reflexes ** Impaired coordination ** Impaired balance ** Dizziness ** Muscle weakness * Coma In animal models, the oral median lethal dose of chlordiazepoxide is 537 mg/kg. Chlordiazepoxide is a drug that is very frequently involved in drug intoxication, including overdose. Chlordiazepoxide overdose is considered a medical emergency and, in general, requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The antidote for an overdose of chlordiazepoxide (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. Flumazenil should be given with caution as it may precipitate severe withdrawal symptoms in benzodiazepine-dependent individuals. Pharmacology Chlordiazepoxide acts on benzodiazepine allosteric sites that are part of the GABAA receptor/ion-channel complex and this results in an increased binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the GABAA receptor thereby producing inhibitory effects on the central nervous system and body similar to the effects of other benzodiazepines. Chlordiazepoxide is anticonvulsant. There is preferential storage of chlordiazepoxide in some organs including the heart of the neonate. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the neonate. The withdrawal of chlordiazepoxide during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as chlordiazepoxide rapidly crosses the placenta and also is excreted in breast milk. Chlordiazepoxide also decreases prolactin release in rats. Benzodiazepines act via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive Calcium uptake in animal nerve terminal preparations. Chlordiazepoxide inhibits acetylcholine release in mouse hippocampal synaptosomes in vivo. This has been found by measuring sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake in vitro after pretreatment of the mice in vivo with chlordiazepoxide. This may play a role in chlordiazepoxide's anticonvulsant properties. Pharmacokinetics Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine drug. The half-life of Chlordiazepoxide is 5 ‚Äì 30 hours but has an active benzodiazepine metabolite (desmethyldiazepam), which has a half-life of 36 ‚Äì 200 hours. The half-life of chlordiazepoxide increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration. Delayed body clearance of the long half-life active metabolite also occurs in those over 60 years of age, which further prolongs the effects of the drugs with additional accumulation after repeated dosing. Despite its name, chlordiazepoxide is not an epoxide; they are formed from different roots. History Chlordiazepoxide (initially called methaminodiazepoxide) was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized in the mid-1950s. The synthesis was derived from work on a class of dyes, quinazolone-3-oxides. It was discovered by accident when in 1957 tests revealed that the compound had hypnotic, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects. \\"The story of the chemical development of Librium and Valium was told by Sternbach. The serendipity involved in the invention of this class of compounds was matched by the trials and errors of the pharmacologists in the discovery of the tranquilizing activity of the benzodiazepines. The discovery of Librium in 1957 was due largely to the dedicated work and observational ability of a gifted technician, Beryl Kappell. For some seven years she had been screening compounds by simple animal tests for muscle relaxant activity...\\" Three years later chlordiazepoxide was marketed as a therapeutic benzodiazepine medication under the brand name Librium. Following chlordiazepoxide, in 1963 diazepam hit the market under the brand name Valium‚Äîand was followed by many further benzodiazepine compounds over the subsequent years and decades. In 1959 it was used by over 2,000 physicians and more than 20,000 patients. It was described as \\"chemically and clinically different from any of the tranquilizers, psychic energizers or other psychotherapeutic drugs now available.\\" During studies, chlordiazepoxide induced muscle relaxation and a quieting effect on laboratory animals like mice, rats, cats, and dogs. Fear and aggression were eliminated in much smaller doses than those necessary to produce hypnosis. Chlordiazepoxide is similar to phenobarbital in its anticonvulsant properties. However, it lacks the hypnotic effects of barbiturates. Animal tests were conducted in the Boston Zoo and the San Diego Zoo. Forty-two hospital patients admitted for acute and chronic alcoholism, and various psychoses and neuroses were treated with chlordiazepoxide. In a majority of the patients, anxiety, tension, and motor excitement were \\"effectively reduced.\\" The most positive results were observed among alcoholic patients. It was reported that ulcers and dermatologic problems, both of which involving emotional factors, were reduced by chlordiazepoxide. In 1963, approval for use was given to diazepam (Valium), a \\"simplified\\" version of chlordiazepoxide, primarily to counteract anxiety symptoms. Sleep-related problems were treated with nitrazepam (Mogadon), which was introduced in 1972, temazepam (Restoril), which was introduced in 1979, and flurazepam (Dalmane), which was introduced in 1975. Recreational use In 1963, Carl F. Essig of the Addiction Research Center of the National Institute of Mental Health stated that meprobamate, glutethimide, ethinamate, ethchlorvynol, methyprylon and chlordiazepoxide as drugs whose usefulness ‚Äúcan hardly be questioned.‚Äù However, Essig labeled these ‚Äúnewer products‚Äù as ‚Äúdrugs of addiction,‚Äù like barbiturates, whose habit-forming qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of chlordiazepoxide, which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams. Chlordiazepoxide is a drug of potential misuse and is frequently detected in urine samples of drug users who have not been prescribed the drug. Legal status Internationally, chlordiazepoxide is a Schedule IV controlled drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Toxicity=Animal Laboratory tests assessing the toxicity of chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam and diazepam on mice spermatozoa found that chlordiazepoxide produced toxicities in sperm including abnormalities involving both the shape and size of the sperm head. Nitrazepam, however, caused more profound abnormalities than chlordiazepoxide. Availability Chlordiazepoxide is available in various dosage forms, alone or in combination with other drugs, worldwide.

O'Grady is an American animated television series created by Tom Snyder, Carl W. Adams, and Holly Schlesinger for Noggin's teen-oriented programming block, The N. The show was animated at Snyder's Soup2Nuts studio. It features the voices of H. Jon Benjamin, Melissa Bardin Galsky, Patrice O'Neal, and Holly Schlesinger playing a group of four teenagers living in the town of O'Grady. In each episode, the characters experience a different supernatural phenomenon while also facing ordinary high school challenges. Plot The series is set in the fictional town of O'Grady, which is periodically plagued by a force called \\"The Weirdness.\\" The Weirdness affects its residents in strange ways, and its effects usually last for several days. For example, it causes people to project their private thoughts in bubbles over their heads, or produce clones of themselves every time they get angry. The focal characters of the show are four students of O'Grady High: Kevin, Abby, Harold, and Beth. Characters=Main characters * Kevin Harnisch (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) is a slacking teenager who never wants to do hard work. He likes to find ways to use the Weirdness for his own gain. He is in a band with Harold and Iris, but the band has never progressed past a few shows. He has a crush on Abby but would never admit it. * Abby Wilde (voiced by Melissa Bardin Galsky) is a fashion-oriented average teenager. She attempts to improve her life around her by trying to \\"help\\" Beth‚Äôs employer gain business by selling non-eco or vegan friendly items in a local health food store. Abby and Kevin have feelings for each other, as shown in many episodes. Abby's longtime love interest is Pete Klesko, but she never manages to make him feel the same way. * Harold Oscar Jenkins (voiced by Patrice O'Neal) is Kevin's best friend who works at Eets-A-Pizza. He can be a little nerdy and often is uncomfortable with Kevin's various schemes. He is genuinely kindhearted and good-spirited, and he likes hanging around with Kevin because he sees the good in him. * Beth Briggs (voiced by Holly Schlesinger) is a blue-haired environmentalist vegetarian, portrayed as a concerned hippie with big ideas. She is Abby's best friend and is usually shown to be the opposite of Kevin. She has good intentions but is naive. She tends to believe anything she hears and always manages to change the story if she retells it. Supporting characters * Phillip Demorio (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) is the smartest student at O'Grady High. He is nerdy, wealthy, and is almost always seen wearing a tie. He speaks very aristocratically in a British accent. Although Kevin tends to make fun of him when they hang around, Phillip is shown to be very self-confident and enjoys showing off his dancing skills. * Iris (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) is a neurotic German exchange student and a devoted fan of techno music. She is part of Kevin and Harold's band. She speaks with an accent, is obsessed with chocolate, and often misunderstands what others are saying to her. She sometimes speaks entire sentences in German. * Pete Klesko (voiced by Larry Murphy) is the most popular student in school. He plays on the lacrosse team, and Abby has had a crush on him for a long time, despite him not being able to remember her name. He has a very dull personality but is still nice. * Donald Alan Lipschitz (voiced by Larry Murphy) is a monotone-speaking substitute teacher. He says \\"Oh, Lord\\" frequently whenever something bad happens. He also seems to suffer a reverse effect to every Weirdness. He has to teach classes whenever the staff become victims to the Weirdness and is often teaching every class the main characters attend. * Dr. Myers (voiced by Bill Braudis) is the school principal. He has braces and is balding. He is not very intelligent or skilled at running the school. He and Mr. Lipschitz have a somewhat unnatural friendship, with both being a little annoyed of the other.

It originally aired on Fox on September 17, 2006. The episode follows Peter's mother, Thelma, divorcing Peter's father, Francis, and dating news anchorman Tom Tucker. Peter becomes closely attached to Tucker, only for his mother to end the relationship suddenly, leaving Peter feeling abandoned. Meanwhile, Stewie and Brian are employed as DJs on a local radio station, but have creative differences over the tone of the show, which eventually forces Brian to quit. The episode was written by Tom Devanney and directed by James Purdum. It received mixed reviews for its storyline, and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 9.23 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Jon Benjamin, Max Burkholder, Phyllis Diller, Phil LaMarr, Joe Lomonaco, Tamera Mowry, Anne- Michelle Seiler, Tara Strong, Nicole Sullivan, Gore Vidal, Gedde Watanabe, and Wally Wingert along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"Mother Tucker\\" was released on DVD along with twelve other episodes from the season on September 18, 2007. Plot Peter's mother, Thelma, visits the Griffin family home, and alerts her son, Peter that she has finally left his father, Francis. In an attempt to find her a new husband, Peter's wife, Lois, takes her to a meeting for \\"single people,\\" where she meets local news anchor Tom Tucker. Thelma and Tom begin dating, which upsets Peter, causing him to attempt to sabotage the new relationship. He is eventually persuaded by Tom that he should let his mother be happy, and the two begin bonding. Eventually, his mother suddenly ends the relationship, however, causing Peter to believe it is his fault. The next day, Peter learns that it is important for fathers and sons to spend time together, and tells Tom that he should spend more time with his own son, Jake, instead. Meanwhile, after interrupting a broadcast of local radio station WQHG's program \\"Weenie and the Butt\\", Brian gets his own radio talk show, when one of the station's producers compliments his speaking voice. Attempting to have an intelligent dialogue with his listeners, and distancing himself from \\"Weenie and the Butt\\"'s constant overuse of sound effects, Brian is immediately heckled by Stewie's prank phone calls. After first planning to cancel Brian's show, the station's producer announces that he loved the calls, and eventually decides to hire Stewie as co-host. Stewie then turns Brian's sophisticated talk show into a lewd, raucous, shock jock- style comedy show called \\"Dingo and the Baby\\", much to Brian's chagrin, who is reluctant to accept the new format. Upon discovering that people love the new show, however, Brian decides to play along with Stewie's idea. However, when author Gore Vidal, whom Brian had contacted for an interview on his original show, walks into one of his \\"Dingo and the Baby\\" broadcasts and leaves in disgust, Brian quits his job in shame. The show is soon replaced by one featuring Cleveland and Quagmire, entitled \\"Dark Chocolate and the Rod\\". Production H. Jon Benjamin guest starred in the episode. The episode was written by series regular Tom Devanney, and directed by James Purdum. During the \\"Weenie and the Butt\\" scene, several sound effects can be heard. Each of these were recorded individually by people who have sung at such venues as the Academy Awards, and other high publicity events. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane has commented that these sound effect recordings took much longer than expected, as they did not sound professional enough. The episode featured guest performances by actress Phyllis Diller, who has portrayed Peter's mother Thelma in various episodes, and Tamera Mowry in her third appearance. Author Gore Vidal appeared as himself in the episode. In the scene involving Thelma trying to convince Peter to accept that she is dating Tucker, she comments, \\"Tom here has won a local Emmy for his work with the retardeds\\". The Fox Broadcasting Company has a specific rule stating that the word \\"retard\\" or \\"retarded\\" cannot be said on their network, but this scene was nevertheless permitted. MacFarlane has commented that he cannot understand why the word is not permitted on Fox, given that it is allowed on other networks. According to MacFarlane and other episode commentators, the scene provoked an angry reaction among the mental health community. There were several scenes throughout this episode that were removed from the script, and not broadcast. One of these comes just after Tom Tucker apologizes to Peter about losing his temper; it was intended that Jake Tucker would appear, and the origin of his upside-down face would be revealed. The scene with \\"The Peanuts Reunion\\" was originally meant for the season four episode \\"Patriot Games\\", but was moved to this episode to ease time constraints in \\"Patriot Games\\". The scene was described by 20th Century Fox worker Leann Siegel as being depressing. \\"Mother Tucker\\", along with the twelve other episodes from Family Guys fifth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on September 18, 2007. The sets included brief audio commentaries by MacFarlane and various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discusses the process behind drawing Peter Griffin, and mini-feature entitled \\"Toys, Toys Galore\\". In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Jon Benjamin, child actor Max Burkholder, actress Phyllis Diller, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actor Joe Lomonaco, voice actress Tamera Mowry, actress Anne-Michelle Seiler, voice actress Tara Strong, voice actress Nicole Sullivan, author Gore Vidal, actor Gedde Watanabe, and voice actor Wally Wingert guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Chris Cox, Ralph Garman, writer David A. Goodman, writer Mike Henry, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener made minor appearances in the episode. Cultural references The episode opens with the Griffin family attending the local Airshow in Quahog, and are shown to be anxiously awaiting one of the pilots to crash. After a pilot successfully lands, Peter expresses his boredom, and states that he would rather be home watching \\"the tape from The Ring\\". In a flashback, Peter begins playing the film, after first being warned, with the 1987 film Mannequin appearing instead and having the same effect as the cursed tape. Deciding to stay at the airshow to watch their neighbor, Glenn Quagmire perform, he flies his plane through several billboards (specifically through the crotch of the women's images on the boards), including those for Veronica Mars, The Simple Life and On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren (which he can only do after \\"getting some help\\" from a Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey billboard. Returning home, the Griffin family decide to watch a television show entitled Roundtable, featuring guests Al Michaels, Harold Ramis, Ray Romano and Kermit the Frog. Once Thelma appears, and alerts Peter of her split-up with his father, Peter is shocked, stating that the same happened at the Peanuts reunion, with Charlie Brown then appearing as a punk rock drug dealer. When Peter finds Thelma and Tom in bed, a cutaway shows Stewie reading a quotation from the movie Harold and Maude. After Thelma leaves Tom, he begins showing Peter more affection, causing Lois to believe it to be strange. Peter then states that it is no stranger than when Darth Vader from the film franchise Star Wars was a parking attendant. Vader is then shown in the contemporary world as a failure, and making minimum wage. This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright. After Stewie takes over Brian's radio show, the two begin playing random sound clips from various films and television shows, including dialogue from the 1993 drama film Philadelphia, which was acknowledged as a mistake by Stewie. Other movie clips used by Brian and Stewie are ‚ÄúOh sexy girlfriend!‚Äù from Sixteen Candles (1984) and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you do it!‚Äù from An Officer and a Gentleman (1982). In an attempt to rebel against Tom Tucker, Peter decides to reach for the freezer to take out some ice cream during dinner, much to the chagrin of Tucker, who attempts to stop him. As Peter lifts a spoon of ice cream to his mouth, he is warned by Tucker several times not to eat it. When he does, however, Tucker repeatedly spanks him, in reference to the 1979 drama feature Kramer vs. Kramer (even though the spanking does not occur in the movie, but it does occur in the 1995 Indian remake, Akele Hum Akele Tum). After author Gore Vidal appears at the radio station Brian had invited him to speak at, Vidal quickly leaves after he finds the show to be low-brow. This causes Brian to quit the show, noting that he has become \\"worse of a sell-out\\" than when Stewie appeared in a Butterfinger commercial. Stewie is then shown eating a Butterfinger, and says \\"Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger\\", which is a parody of the many Butterfinger commercials featuring Bart Simpson, and utters the annoyed grunt, D'oh!, a phrase used regularly by The Simpsons character Homer Simpson. The bit is also a reference to the negative criticism and similarities between Family Guy and The Simpsons. Reception In a slight decrease from the previous week, the episode was viewed in 9.23 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.3 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, slightly edging out The Simpsons, in addition to series creator Seth MacFarlane's second show American Dad!, in both rating and total viewership. Reviews of the episode were mixed, calling it a \\"slow start to the season.\\" Dan Iverson of IGN reviewed the episode positively, noting that the episode \\"would make even the most anti-Family Guy television viewers out there laugh pretty hard.\\" Iverson went on to comment, however, that \\"it probably won't be remembered as fondly as some of the episodes from the first few seasons.\\" For him, the \\"funniest aspect of the episode\\" was the radio scene, in which \\"we get the impression that [radio jockeys] are immature, simple-minded idiots.\\" Brett Love of TV Squad reviewed the episode slightly more negatively, stating that \\"the whole Peter story just didn't do much for me.\\" Love did find that the \\"Stewie and Brian stuff was the best part of the episode,\\" but went on to proclaim that \\"there are 20 more episodes to get it right.\\" In his review of the Family Guy Volume 5 box set, Francis Rizzo of DVD Talk wrote that the radio subplot is \\"a perfect parody of everything that's wrong in radio.\\" ReferencesExternal links Family Guy (season 5) episodes 2006 American television episodes ","title":"Mother Tucker"},{"id":"6320616","text":"The TIFR Centre in Bangalore is a part of the School of Mathematics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.

Meilland', is a well-known and successful garden rose. By 1992, over one hundred million plants of this hybrid tea had been sold. The cultivar has large flowers of a light yellow to cream color, slightly flushed at the petal edges with crimson-pink. It is hardy and vigorous and relatively resistant to disease, making it popular in gardens as well as in the floral trade. It was developed by French horticulturist Francis Meilland in the years 1935 to 1939. When Meilland foresaw the German invasion of France, he sent cuttings to friends in Italy, Turkey, Germany, and the United States to protect the new rose. It is said that it was sent to the US on the last plane available before the German invasion, where it was safely propagated by the Conard Pyle Co. during the war.  Development  The cultivar was hybridized in 1935, receiving the number 3-35-40 (the third hybridization in 1935, and the 40th cultivar selected for test proliferation). As those first tests produced beautiful flowers in autumn of 1936, the first no. 3-35-40 were grown in Meilland's rose fields in June 1939. That summer, cuttings were sent to partners in other countries. According to Meilland's records, 'Madame A. Meilland' was hybridized from the hybrid tea 'Margaret McGredy' and an unnamed seedling.  Naming  Rosa 'Madame A. Meilland' (Peace) Because Meilland had sent out his cuttings just before the war, communication between the cultivators was not possible, which is why the rose received different names. In France, Francis and Alain Meilland decided to call the cultivar 'Madame A. Meilland', in honor of Francis' deceased mother, Alain Meilland's wife Claudia. This is the formal cultivar name. Other names are considered by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants as trade or selling names. In Italy it was called (Italian for \\"joy\\"), in Germany (Latin for \\"glory of God\\") and in the US, Sweden, and Norway . The rose eventually became known as . In early 1945 rose grower Meilland wrote to Field Marshal Alan Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke) to thank him for his key part in the liberation of France and to ask if Brooke would give his name to the rose. Brooke declined saying that, though he was honored to be asked, his name would soon be forgotten and a much better and more enduring name would be \\"Peace\\". The adoption of the trade name \\"Peace\\" was publicly announced in the United States on 29 April 1945 by the introducers, Conard Pyle Co. This was the very day that Berlin fell, a day considered a turning point in the Second World War in Europe. Later that year Peace roses were given to each of the delegations at the inaugural meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco, each with a note that read: :\\"We hope the 'Peace' rose will influence men‚Äôs thoughts for everlasting world peace\\". Peter Beales, English rose grower and expert, said in his book Roses: :\\"'Peace', without doubt, is the finest Hybrid Tea ever raised and it will remain a standard variety forever\\". 'Mme A. Meilland' bud  Description  'Mme A. Meilland' forms elegant buds that open to large, cupped flowers with a high- centered form and an average diameter of . Their color is a combination of pale yellow and crimson edges that depends on the location, the weather and changes as the flower fades. The durable flowers are very full, with 40 to 43 petals, survive rainy periods, and have a sweet and fruity fragrance that varies in its strength from mild to strong. The cultivar flowers continuously throughout the season up to the first frost. The vigorous shrub grows high and wide, is winter hardy down to (USDA zone 6), half-shade tolerant, and disease resistant. The large, glossy leaves are very dark and leathery. 'Mme A. Meilland' is very versatile‚Äîit is used as cut rose and as garden rose, solitarily or in groups, as standard rose to high, or in containers.  Awards  'Mme A. Meilland' has been granted numerous awards, starting with the selection as Most Beautiful French Rose in Lyon in 1942, gold medals in Lyon (1942), Portland (1944), The Hague (1965) and from the Royal National Rose Society in 1947. In 1944, it was included in the All-America Rose Selection. In 1976, it was the first cultivar to be granted the highest award a rose can be granted when it was selected as World's Favorite Rose and included into the Rose Hall of Fame. In 2018, the U.S. Postal Service issued a new Forever stamp celebrating the Peace Rose. The dedication ceremony was held at The Gardens of the American Rose Center in Shreveport, Louisiana.  Sports and hybrid offspring  As an often cultivated plant, several sports of 'Mme A. Meilland' are known. 'Climbing Peace' (Kordes 1951) has slightly bigger flowers but flowers less well, 'Chicago Peace' (Johnston 1962) differs mainly in its richer colors with a mixture of crimson and apricot, while 'Kronenbourg' (syn. 'Flaming Peace', McGredy 1966) has red petals with yellow backs, creating an interesting contrast. It is also used in the hybridization of new cultivars, and played a role in the development of well known cultivars such as 'Garden Party' (Swim, 1959), 'Super Star' (Tantau, 1960), and 'Pullman Orient Express' (Lim & Twomey, 1991).

Life Pirie was born in Guelph, Upper Canada, to George Pirie (1799‚Äì1870), a native of Aberdeen, Scotland. His mother was Jane Booth (1825‚Äì1895), born in Lonmay Aberdeenshire to a family from the Isle of Noss in the Shetland Islands. George Pirie emigrated to Upper Canada with a group of Aberdeen merchants and businessmen. The family arrived in 1838 and joined the Bon Accord settlement located in the vicinity of Elora. He arrived with his first wife, Mary Robieson, and their children. She died not long after her settlement in Canada, and Mr. Pirie married Miss Jane Booth. In 1848, George Pirie became the publisher of the Guelph Herald newspaper after his attempt at farming in the Bon Accord community. The farm was sold and the family moved to Guelph where he ran the Guelph Herald publishing and printing office on Wyndham Street. The elder Pirie was a staunch conservative and Scottish Canadian poet. As a young man, Alexander Fraser Pirie assisted at his father's newspaper office. The paper struggled to maintain circulation and relied upon job printing work. Imprint magazine later described these early days in a profile of Pirie: > \\"He first saw the light of publication day in his father's office, the > Guelph Herald, in 1849, and was brought up to the sound of the mallet and > planer, the hammering of wooden quoins in the chases and the incessant cry > of \\"Color!\\" on the part of the man who pulled the lever of the Washington > press. The principal event of his early life was stirring the glue and > molasses over a hot fire when the foreman decided to cast a new roller, the > making of a new roller being at that time regarded as an epoch in the > history of all well-regulated country printing offices.\\"Imprint. Toronto & > Winnipeg: Vol. 1., No. 3, July‚ÄìAugust, 1893. At 21 years of age, after his father's death in 1870, Pirie became publisher of The Herald. During this time he took on the numerous duties of a local newspaper which included the issuing of marriage licenses. At this time he received a letter from John A. Macdonald authorizing him as the local agent for these licenses. However, Pirie had a great desire to work as a journalist in a larger city, and two years later moved on to Toronto. In 1924, The Herald was absorbed by the Guelph Mercury. By 1874, Pirie was working at The Toronto SunThis publication had no connection to The Toronto Sun established in 1971. It was an earlier and short-lived Toronto newspaper with the same name. It was published for several years during the 1870s, and soon went out of business. as a columnist. From a circa 1876 article: > \\"The Sun...still retains one of the most fertile humorists in Canada in the > person of Mr. Alexander Pirie, commonly known as the \\"Sun Skit Urchin\\". This > gentleman, who is still very young, finds plenty of work for the scissors of > his contemporaries in a daily column of \\"Sun Skits.\\" They abound in reckless > humor, sparing no one, and have just the pleasant bitterness of a dry > curacoa. They have now flowed forth in an uninterrupted stream for nearly > two years, and neither the supply nor quality shows any signs of falling > off\\". A caricature of Pirie as the \\"Sun Skit Urchin\\" appeared in Grip magazine at this time. Grip magazine was Canada's version of the satirical British magazine Punch. While Pirie was also a contributor to Grip, these contributions were submitted anonymously. He also penned several articles for Saturday Night. \\"Rambles About Rimouski\\" was a story of the history of Rimouski, Quebec. Pirie was a popular editorial columnist, as well as social figure and public speaker. During the 1870s, he lived with his mother and other family members on Mutual Street in Toronto. This house, now demolished, was in the vicinity of where Ryerson University now stands. He was in demand as a public speaker, and known for his use of political humour. Throughout his years in Toronto Pirie was present at many of the city's social events, such as an 1885 reading by Robert Kirkland Kernighan. His speaking engagements ranged from reviews of his European travels to speeches in support of Liberal political candidates. Masonic Certificate, 1875. Pirie was accepted as a Mason on September 1, 1875, at the Grand Lodge at Hamilton, Ontario. This would have enhanced many social connections in Victorian era Toronto. In 1876, Pirie joined the Toronto Telegram. He was best known as the second editor of the Telegram, a role he held until 1888. The Telegram was founded in 1876 by John Ross Robertson as a paper devoted to Toronto's interests, and, as Robertson described it, devoted to \\"today's news to-day\\"The Municipality of Toronto / A History. Toronto, 1923. Pirie spent his first year at the Telegram working under the historian John Charles Dent. After that he took on the role of editor which he held until 1888. A 1923 review of the history of Toronto newspapers commented on Pirie's time at the Telegram: \\"Then came Mr. A. F. Pirie, one of the wittiest and most companionable of men, whose paragraphs, straight-flung and barbed at the point, enlarged public interest in the enterprise\\". In 1886, Pirie participated in a literary debate relating to Canada's role in North America and her relationship with the United States. Articles under the heading \\"Canadian Prospects and Politics\\" were submitted to The North American Review for the January 1886 issue (Volume 142, Issue 350) by the Marquis of Lorne and A. F. Pirie with a brief note from Sir John A. Macdonald. In February 1893, Pirie was elected president of the Canadian Press Association.Hamilton Spectator. February 10, 1893 In this capacity he spoke on behalf of Canadian interests at the World Press Conference in Chicago, Illinois. In a May 29, 1893, article from the Toronto Mail, \\"Good Words for Canada: Plain Talk at the Press Convention\\", it was reported that Canada had the \\"honor of closing the proceedings of the ninth annual convention of the National Editorial Association\\" with the last address delivered by A. F. Pirie. Mr. Pirie also represented the Canadian Press Association at the World's Press Congress. The reporter felt that \\"He said some good words for Canada, reminding his hearers that there were a hundred thousand Canadians in Chicago alone...\\" Also, that Pirie had noted the role women had been taking in the press congress and stated that as the public journals were made for men and women, ...\\"there seemed to be no good reason that women as well as men should not bear a part in making them\\". Finally, he made a strong plea for closer trade relations between the U.S. and Canada: \\"...holding it to be a shame and an outrage that Canadian workmen should be shut out of the United States, and Canadian products subjected to a high duty, after all the Canadians had done for the United States at the time of the civil war, when 40,000 took up arms for the union, and all that Canadians in the States are still doing in building up that country\\". He appealed to the journalists of America for fair play for Canada. Pirie's work attracted many admirers. Imprint magazine, in profiling the new President of the Canadian Press Association wrote in reference to his 1889 William Notman portrait which was published within the article: \\"The portrait does not do justice to its subject: to do so it would require to be a \\"speaking likeness\\", for our friend is just as handy with his tongue as he is with his pen‚Äîhe is a born orator as well as journalist.\\" Commenting on his career, Imprint noted: \\"Mr. Pirie is a writer of great versatility, a capital speaker, one of the best-natured men in the profession, and publishes a model country weekly...\\"; and on his popularity: \\"He is one of the most popular of our Canadian journalists, a believer in his country and its future, and is a good representative of the men who make Canadian newspapers.\\" Mr. & Mrs. A. F. Pirie's residence, Sydenham Lodge, Dundas, Ontario, Canada. Circa 1890s. He married Hester Emma McCausland (1858‚Äì1901) in Toronto on June 12, 1889, at her father's home on Jarvis Street. Miss McCausland's father Joseph McCausland had been in Toronto since the 1820s and was a native of Armagh, Ireland, and founder of a successful Toronto stained glass window firm. The newly married couple moved to Montreal where Pirie briefly worked as an Editor at the Montreal Star. At this time, they were photographed by Canada's top portrait photographer William Notman. By 1889, they returned to Dundas, Ontario and purchased a home on Sydenham Street that they named \\"Sydenham Lodge\\". Four children were born in Dundas during the 1890s: Russell Fraser,Russell Fraser Pirie (1890-1956) served in the first World War with the 41st Battery Canadian Field Artillery. He served again in the Second World War with the Veterans' Guard of Canada. He is buried in Grove Cemetery, Dundas, Ontario. Elsie Gowan, Jean Booth and Goldwin McCausland. In recent years, this home was used for the filming of one episode in Season Six of The West Wing. In 1895, Pirie lost his mother, Jane (Booth) Pirie, who fell ill after a visit to Dundas from her Toronto home. Jane Pirie had actively assisted in her husband's publishing and printing business in Guelph, and in the 1890s had drafted an account of her travels to Western Canada which Mr. Pirie published in the Dundas Banner. Pirie was interested in politics and during the Parliamentary session of 1888 he had represented the Montreal Star in the press gallery at Ottawa.The Hamilton Review, June 14, 1918 In the Provincial General Election of 1898, Pirie had received a Reform nomination as a candidate for North Wentworth.The Canadian Men and Women of the Time. 1st edition. Edited by Henry James Morgan. Toronto: Wm. Briggs, 1898,pg. 822. This was not successful, and afterwards he worked for the Liberal Party of Canada, often appearing as a public speaker, or editing work destined for publication. He appeared in Brantford, Ontario, on behalf of the Hon. William Paterson for the election of 1900. At that time, the audience rose to its feet in a standing ovation. Pirie began his speech noting that his reputation as a humorist preceded him, however, in this case, he had some serious issues to cover.Brantford Expositor, November 1900. Pirie's wife died of pneumonia in 1901 after a brief illness. She was only 43 years old. After this time, Pirie's health broke down and he limited his public engagements. He continued some of his work for the Liberal Party of Canada and public speaking engagements. According to newspaper accounts after his death, his relatives noted that he began to stay indoors for much of the time. His cousin, Robinson Pirie of Hamilton, began to visit him to urge him to get out. In 1901, he attended a conference for the Canadian Press Association held in Charlottetown, P.E.I. Pirie wrote to his sister-in-law in Toronto (Mrs. Boyce Thompson) that many events had lost their lustre. He told her that he and his wife had always dreamt of returning to Toronto after the children grew up. He described the regular visits he made to his wife's grave on Sundays. In July 1903, Pirie visited relatives in Brandon, Manitoba, in conjunction with some work for the Liberal party. Relatives hoped that this trip might improve his state of mind. After his return to Dundas, he died at home on August 15, 1903. This event shocked the community. In a letter preserved at the Whitehern museum archives, Mrs. McQuesten wrote to her son Rev. Calvin McQuesten in Montreal about the event. Pirie's pallbearers included John Ross Robertson of the Toronto Telegram. He was buried in Grove Cemetery next to his wife. Four children were left without parents. The children's guardian was their paternal aunt, Ada L. Pirie (Mrs. Walpole Murdoch), who had been assisting Pirie since the death of her sister-in-law. Pirie's youngest son, Goldwin McCausland PirieSearch Details - Veterans Affairs Canada at www.vac-acc.gc.ca (1894‚Äì1915), died of wounds received at the Second Battle of Ypres during the First World War. A soldier with the 1st Battalion Western Ontario Regiment, Goldwin Pirie was selected to work as a bomb thrower due to his athletic ability. He had attended Trinity College School in Port Hope where he was well respected as a member of their football rugby team. The 1st battalion participated in a counterattack after the gas attacks, and Goldwin Pirie was hit by a shell during this assault. He lay wounded for several days upon the battlefield before he was picked up and transported for further care. He died at Netley (Royal Victoria Hospital) in England about two months after he was wounded. Pirie, known as Goldie, sent several articles back to Dundas for publication in the Dundas Star in 1914 while he was in training at Valcartier Camp, Quebec. He wrote his articles with a humorous bent in the tradition of his father. In 1918, The Hamilton Review published an article on Pirie by Sir John Willison (of The Globe) who had been profiling political and public personalities from Canada's past. He wrote: > \\"But Mr. Pirie was more than a jester. He had qualities of heart and mind > which were seldom revealed and only to those who had his affection and > confidence. These were few, for beneath an apparent openness and spontaneity > there was a reserve which was not easily penetrated. He got much out of > life, but not all that he desired. Happy but often anxious and > foreboding...when I think of Pirie I recall what was said of Shelley: 'He > passed through life like a strange bird upon a great journey, singing always > of the paradise to which he was travelling, and suddenly lost from the sight > of men in the midst of his song.' \\"Sir John Willison, The Hamilton Review, > June 14, 1918 Gallery Image:Original record children of G Pirie and J Booth.jpgOriginal handwritten family record for the children of George Pirie and Jane Booth, Guelph, Ontario.

These cells were discovered by Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel in the late 1950s.D. H. Hubel and T. N. Wiesel Receptive Fields of Single Neurones in the Cat's Striate Cortex J. Physiol. pp. 574-591 (148) 1959 Such cells are tuned to different frequencies and orientations, even with different phase relationships, possibly for extracting disparity (depth) information and to attribute depth to detected lines and edges. This may result in a 3D 'wire- frame' representation as used in computer graphics. The fact that input from the left and right eyes is very close in the so-called cortical hypercolumns is an indication that depth processing occurs at a very early stage, aiding recognition of 3D objects. Later, many other cells with specific functions have been discovered: (a) end-stopped cells which are thought to detect singularities like line and edge crossings, vertices and line endings; (b) bar and grating cells. The latter are not linear operators because a bar cell does not respond when seeing a bar which is part of a periodic grating, and a grating cell does not respond when seeing an isolated bar. Using the mathematical Gabor model with sine and cosine components (phases), complex cells are then modeled by computing the modulus of complex Gabor responses. Both simple and complex cells are linear operators and are seen as filters because they respond selectively to a large number of patterns. However, it has been claimed that the Gabor model does not conform to the anatomical structure of the visual system as it short-cuts the LGN and uses the 2D image as it is projected on the retina. Azzopardi and PetkovG. Azzopardi and N. Petkov A CORF computational model that relies on LGN input outperforms the Gabor function model Biological Cybernetics, vol. 106(3), pp. 177-189, DOI: 10.1007/s00422-012-0486-6, 2012 have proposed a computational model of a simple cell, which combines the responses of model LGN cells with center- surround receptive fields (RFs). They call it Combination of RFs (CORF) model. Besides orientation selectivity, it exhibits cross orientation suppression, contrast invariant orientation tuning and response saturation. These properties are observed in real simple cells but are not possessed by the Gabor model. Using simulated reverse correlation they also demonstrate that the RF map of the CORF model can be divided into elongated excitatory and inhibitory regions typical of simple cells.

Description The Vextra 105mm was classified as an armored reconnaissance vehicle, fire support vehicle, and or anti-tank vehicle. It is manned by a four person crew consisting of, The commander, driver, gunner, and loader It was developed in the early 1990s by former GIAT industries, now Nexter Systems, and was revealed in 1997. The Vextra 105mm was somewhat based on multiple preceding French armored vehicles of similar type. Aluminum armor was used to keep the tank as light as possible (weight was 28t - 33t depending on level of ballistic protection) which was also used on the AMX-10P IFV, an armored vehicle produced starting in 1973. The Vextra 105mm is also a wheeled vehicle, with an 8x8 chassis based on the Vextra IFV, a very similar prototype vehicle with the Dragar one man turret and a 25mm gun. The Vextra 105mm was aimed at both the French army and export customers, but after some successful trials in France, and many successful firepower tests in the United Arab Emirates, the vehicle still received no production orders.http://homepage.tinet.ie/~militaryx/newsite/website/armored/20.htm The Vextra 105mm was equipped with a GIAT TLM 105mm three-man turret and GIAT G2 low recoil 105mm gun. The gun is compatible with NATO standard 105mm shells including armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) ammunition. The vehicle carries a total of 35 shells for the main armament 12 of which are stowed in the turret. The Vextra 105 is also equipped with coaxially mounted 7.62mm machine guns and the Galix close defense system. The Galix close defense system consists of four 80mm launchers on either side of the gun at front, and three on either side at the rear. With 16 total wide dimension tires, light aluminum armor, 600hp Saab Scania diesel engine, and hydropneumatic suspension, the Vextra 105 can reach speeds of 120km/h on road.Hydropneumatic suspension The hydropneumatic suspension system uses large fluid filled spheres to internally compress, and absorb shock. This suspension system rather than one using springs makes for a smooth ride and allows the Vextra 105 to traverse more difficult terrain. The FINDERS system A version of the FINDERS (Fast Information, Navigation, Decision and Reporting System) is installed in the Vextra 105mm and on the Leclerc main battle tank. Also developed by GIAT industries, the FINDERS system performs a variety of functions for their tanks, it displays a color map with positions of the host, allied, and hostile vehicle(s), designated targets, alphanumeric messages, many digital mapping options, communication options, and more. Usage of wheeled chassis At the time of the Vextra 105mm's testing, wheeled armored vehicles were manufactured and used substantially less than tracked vehicles as compared with the present. In many cases wheeled armored vehicles are without a gun/primary armament and are instead used for hauling troops. Tracked vehicles have been used in the military for more time, however recent use of wheeled chassis is increasing because wheeled vehicles are faster, more maneuverable, lighter, and wheeled systems are generally less complicated.

The reserve is located on the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence at the mouth of the Natashquan River, east of Sept-√éles and has been accessible by Route 138 since 1996. The reserve should not be confused with the adjacent but distinct township of Natashquan just to the north and east. The community is serviced by a nursing station, community radio station, municipal water and sewer system, fire station, and an aboriginal police force. The site was mapped in 1684 by Louis Jolliet who called it Noutasco√ºan. It was subsequently spelled as Nontascouanne (1734), Natasquan (1831), Nataskwan (1844), Natashkwan (1846), Natosquan (1857), Nataskouan (1858), and taking its current form, Natashquan, circa 1895. This name, spelled Nutahkuant or Nutashkuan in the contemporary Innu language, is usually translated as \\"where the black bear is taken\\" or \\"where one hunts for bear.\\" History Historically, the nomadic Innu lived on their hunting grounds of the interior during the winter and would move to the coast in the summer for salmon fishing and seal hunting. From as early as 1710, a trading post was established on the left (south) bank of the Natashquan River and later on the opposite bank to conduct fur trade with the indigenous. They gathered at the post during their annual migration and began to settle there permanently. The post was acquired by the Hudson's Bay Company in the middle of the 19th century, but abandoned circa 1914 due to lack of profitability. In 1909, the first land survey was conducted for the creation of a reserve. In 1952, the first of land were bought by the Government of Canada and transferred for the use by the Innu on 31 March 1953. The reserve was incrementally enlarged in 1954, 1970, and 1993.Natural Resources Canada ‚Äì Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review ‚Äì Natashquan land title history Demographics As of December 2009, the band counted 984 members, of which 920 persons lived on the reserve.

Summers are mild and rainy, with mild days and cool nights. Winters are cold with extremely heavy annual snowfall, averaging 140 inches (356 cm). Natashquan receives around 1,900 hours of sunshine per year. Economy Natashquan's economy is mostly based on arts and handicrafts, trapping, tourism, and some construction, transport, and commercial fishing. In all there are some 20 businesses on the reserve. The Band council owns a boat and holds a crab-fishing licence. Local economic development is promoted by and the responsibility of the Corporation de d√©veloppement √©conomique de Natashquan.

Since 1958 it has been owned by the Danvers Historical Society. A National Historic Landmark, it is significant as an extremely rare and well-preserved example of an 18th- century summer house, and also includes some of the earliest American sculpture in the carved wooden figures mounted on its roof. Description and history Samuel McIntire designed this ornate Federal style garden house for Elias Hasket Derby's farm in Salem, Massachusetts. The structure is 20 feet square, 2¬Ω stories high, decorated with pilasters, swags, and Grecian urns, and topped with rustic wood statues of a Reaper and Shepherdess (milkmaid). The ground floor is punctuated by central arched openings on the east and west facades, each flanked with arched windows with wooden keystones. The second floor is ornamented with swags and fluted Ionic pilasters at the corners and between windows. A young lady's diary from 1802 records her contemporary impressions: The summer house was moved to its present location in 1901, about 4 miles from its original site, where it now opens onto a walled rose garden designed by Herbert Browne. Neither of the two statues atop the house are originals. The Shepherdess was missing when the house was transported; after 20 years she was found atop an Andover mill building, damaged by fire. A duplicate was carved in 1924, and the original is now on display in the Peabody Institute. The original Reaper fell in a storm in 1981. It too was reproduced; the original is in the Danvers Historical Society collection. The summer house was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1968. and Image:Derby Summer House (interior) - Danvers, Massachusetts.jpgInterior, second floor.

It is about a woman, played by Ishaa Koppikar, who becomes the first female crime lady in Mumbai. The film was completed in 2005 and was showcased as the opening film at the Rome Film Festival, and was also premiered at the New York Asian Film Festival.Much- Delayed Shabri Gets A Sequel!  Box Office India : India‚Äôs premier film trade magazine The film was officially released worldwide on 26 August 2011.RGV: SHABRI is far superior to SATYA - bollywood news : glamsham.com Plot The film starts with accidental death of Kisnya (younger brother of the villain), who insists that Shabri be handed over to Police for the murder of Inspector Khare, which Murad ( a friendly neighbor of Shabri family who is a bookie) forcefully opposes. Shabri is guilty of murder of a wicked police inspector (Khare) who tried to rape her in police station in front of her younger brother who has already been tortured by Khare. After killing Kisnya, Murad and Shabri (now both murderers) run away from Mumbai to a farmhouse uptown, but are nevertheless traced by Rajdar bhau's gang (who is even helped by a corrupt officer named Inspector Kadam). There is a shoot out. Murad gets shot and is captured by the gang (he is later put to death with two dozen bullets by an angry Rajdhar Bhau, who wants to avenge Kisnya's death). Shabri is taken to Kadam's flat where the drunk officer tries to rape her but Shabri again somehow manages to run away after shooting Kadam in foot and breaking a bottle of beer on his head. Now another friend of the late Murad namely Vilas helps her. Here an interesting character, Irfan Kazi (played by Zakir Hussain) enters the story, interesting because it is not possible to make out if he is good or evil. Nevertheless, he is an encounter cop who is fed up with killing criminals and wishes to do something more creative for his own entertainment. He does this by giving Shabri inside knowhow of Rajdar Bhau's gang where unknown to the egotist Rajdar almost every one, by now fed up with selfishness of their boss, is standing on brink of rebellion. In the climax, Shabri at last comes face to face with Rajdar bhau and he is shocked to learn that Shabri is not there to beg for mercy but to kill him. Each gangster standing around them are now friends of Shabri and ready to kill Rajdar at her signal - their guns are pointed at Rajdar bhau (using her leadership qualities and Kazi's contacts she has convinced all of them that their future and well being is now in getting rid of Rajdar bhau and reorganizing under Shabri's being their chief under whom they will all work as equal partners ). Rajdar Bhau, with Shabri's approval shoots himself.

It is usually powered by a variable-speed electric motor. Padded flooring is often installed around the equipment in order to reduce the likelihood of injury to those thrown off it. A \\"quick stop\\" motor allows the operator to safely control the ride and ensure safety for the rider; this feature allows the operator to stop the ride prior to a rider being thrown. The trained operator at the variable speed control box regulates the unit's Buck-and-Spin speed, as well as spin direction. The equipment has the capability of starting rides very slowly and speeds can be advanced according to a rider's ability. It can go slowly and simply spin for beginners and run at greater speed for experts. Prior to the development of a bucking machine, a simpler device was created by attaching ropes (sometimes a rope-and-pulley system) to the ends of a large barrel, suspending it from four points, often tall posts or the rafters of a barn. A saddle or bucking equipment would be added, and then a rider would straddle the barrel. Two to four other people would move the barrel by pulling on the ropes to emulate the movement of an animal. This \\"bucking barrel\\" is still also used as a less-expensive option for practice and entertainment. Mechanical bulls have existed for decades as a training device for rodeo competitors, as they enable a rider of rough stock (bucking horses and bulls) to enhance rodeo performance and refine skills without the risk and unpredictability of a live animal. Although mechanical bulls are still routinely used for rodeo training, they are also utilized as an amusement ride, both as a mobile rental (i.e., party entertainment) and stationary entertainment found in bars, restaurants, and clubs; these may be surrounded by an blown-air inflated structure similar to a \\"bounce house\\" or foam pits for safety. There is a modified, less dangerous style used for children's parties, usually with a one-minute timer. Children remove their shoes to get on. They hold a rope or peg on the shoulder or neck of the machine, and the person who stays on for the whole minute without falling off wins a small prize. As a form of entertainment, the mechanical bull often includes a saddle (used only in saddle bronc riding, not bareback or bull riding) and often a model head of a bull, complete with horns. One of the earliest uses as a form of entertainment was at Bertrand Island Amusement Park in New Jersey), where a mechanical bucking bronco ride was introduced in the 1930s, under the name of \\"Ride 'Em Cowboy!\\". A woman riding on a mechanical bull The mechanical bull as an entertainment device as well as the commercial use of mechanical bulls gained popular appeal with the release of the 1980 movie Urban Cowboy. In this movie John Travolta and Debra Winger demonstrated the art of riding a mechanical bull to the larger movie-going population. The mechanical bull featured in this movie was the El Toro brand of mechanical bull. This brand of mechanical bull is still in circulation, but does not carry the same safety features that are available on more current models. \\"Bucking bronco\\" or \\"bronc\\" is cowboy slang for a horse that throws a person around. Cultural references Mechanical bulls can be seen in the films Urban Cowboy, Stir Crazy, and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. In the movie Barnyard, in the night barn, a \\"Mechanical Man\\" is seen (as the main characters are cows). In the television show Strangers with Candy, Jerri Blank's P.E. class is seen to have mechanical bull riding. Feeder's 2012 music video for their single \\"Idaho\\", features actor Daniel Mays riding a mechanical bull. James Spader rode one in Boston Legal \\"Death not be Proud\\" episode, aired in 2005. Safety Although injuries from mechanical bulls are relatively rare, there are a variety of ways that a person can be injured while riding a mechanical bull. These injuries can be caused by falling on the ground, striking the bull or getting caught on it, or injuries caused by the bucking motion. In 2003 a 28-year-old man was paralyzed after being thrown from a mechanical bull at a county fair. He sued for $50 million in damages claiming that the ride was deceptive because there was no warning about the steel frame underneath the pad that the man struck when he was thrown from the bull. Because of the risk of injury many venues require varying levels of insurance coverage to keep themselves protected. There are also very few insurance companies that will insure mechanical bulls because of the risk involved. There are however mechanisms in the bulls that keep the risk of injury much lower. Many of the bulls have continuous pressure airbags, rounded padded body designs and controls that control the speed and bucking motion. Operator training on safety is provided through some of the insurance companies that insure mechanical bulls.

He was the William Thompson Sedgwick Professor of Biophysics at MIT (since 1958) and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Rich earned both an A.B. (magna cum laude) and an M.D. (cum laude) from Harvard University. He was a post-doc of Linus Pauling along with James Watson. During this time he was a member of the RNA Tie Club, a social and discussion group which attacked the question of how DNA encodes proteins. He had over 600 publications to his name. Born in Hartford, Connecticut,https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/acdscien/2008/rich2008.pdf Rich was the founder of Alkermes and was a director beginning in 1987. Dr. Rich was Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Repligen Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company. He was also a member of the Board of Directors for Profectus BioSciences, Inc. He also served on the editorial board of Genomics and the Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics.  Personal life  Rich spent his early life in Springfield, Massachusetts. He grew up in a working class family and worked in the U.S. Armory while he was in high school. From 1943 to 1946, Rich was in the U.S. Navy. He obtained a bachelor‚Äôs in biochemical sciences from Harvard University in 1947 and a medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1949. Rich was married to Jane King and is survived by four children: Benjamin, Josiah, Rebecca, and Jessica Rich Sturley. Rich died on April 27, 2015, aged 90.  Academic career  At Harvard, Rich he studied with John Edsall, who inspired him to pursue an academic career. In 1949, he moved to the California Institute of Technology to perform postdoctoral research with Linus Pauling. He met James Watson during his time in Pauling's lab. He stayed in Pauling's group until 1954. Rich worked as a section chief in physical chemistry at the National Institutes of Health from 1954 to 1958. He spent a sabbatical at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge (1955-1956), where he worked with Francis Crick and solved the structure of collagen. He became a professor at MIT in 1958. He worked diligently at MIT until his death in 2015. He still went into lab until two months before his death.  Contributions to science  His work played a pivotal role in the discovery of nucleic acid hybridization. In 1955, Rich and Crick solved the structure of collagen. In 1963, Rich discovered polysomes: clusters of ribosomes which read one strand of mRNA simultaneously. From 1969 to 1980, he was a biology investigator looking for life on mars with NASA's Viking Mission to Mars. In 1973, Rich's lab determined the structure of tRNA. In 1979, Rich and co-workers at MIT grew a crystal of Z-DNA. After 26 years of attempts, Rich et al. finally crystallised the junction box of B- and Z-DNA. Their results were published in an October 2005 Nature journal. Whenever Z-DNA forms, there must be two junction boxes that allow the flip back to the canonical B-form of DNA.

Education Enric Heras de Sicars (later in India he anglicised his Christian name to Henry) was the heir of a well-off rural household from the village of Canet d'Adri, near Girona, in Catalonia. His parents were Pon√ß Heras and Maria Sicars. The Heras family had been established in the property of Adri since the late thirteenth century, but Enric gave up his rights in order to follow his religious vocation. After becoming a Jesuit in 1904, Heras followed the usual course of Jesuit priestly formation: three years of philosophy in Tortosa, three years of teaching History in Orihuela, Alacant, Spain, and the theological course in Sarri√†, Barcelona, at the end of which he was ordained a Catholic priest in 1920. Historian in India On arrival in India (1922) he was appointed to teach history at St Xavier's College, Bombay. He chose to teach Indian history \\"because he wanted to study it\\". This became his favorite subject and field of competence. He wrote a short book on historical methodology, The Writing of History, which became compulsory reading for his students. He founded the Indian Historical Research Institute (1926), which trained numerous historians and Indologists, including Frank Moraes, Dr. Keny, and others. The institute was later renamed the Heras Institute of Indian History and Culture. The Heras Memorial Lecture is held annually at the Institute.British Museum Director to Inaugurate ‚ÄòConservation Centre‚Äô at St. Xavier‚Äôs, xaviers.edu. Retrieved 19 June 2019. Proto-historian and archeologist From 1935 on he turned his attention to the newly excavated archeological sites of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa: he was particularly keen on deciphering the inscriptions of the so-called Indus Valley Civilization. He wrote numerous articles on the topic, summing up finally his research in what will remain his master piece: Studies in Proto-Indo-Mediterranean Culture (1953) in which he proposed a solution to the mysterious script of Mohenjo- Daro, and established cultural links between the Indus Valley Civilization, the Sumerian-Egyptian civilization and the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Though the deciphering he proposed is not yet fully convincing it is \\"gaining ever greater acceptance by the specialists\\".A. L. Basham, Indica, 1978, 2(1). Although, fellow Jesuits in India, like father George Gispert (i.e. Jordi Gispert-Sa√ºch) have expressed that his paramount work was his book on Vijayanagar. Other activities and achievements Heras was also the founder of the Bombay Historical Society and was also actively involved in the Indian Historical Records Commission, Indian History Congress and the International Congress of Historical Sciences. Being totally identified with the culture of the country he chose to become an Indian citizen as soon as possible after the independence of 1947. Among his many students is Dr. S.V. Sohoni, who studied under him in the early twentieth century. The same admiration for Indian culture led him to encourage Christian artists to adopt Indian forms of art and symbols in order to express Christian themes. In painting he enthused over Angelo Fonseca, Olimpio Coleto Rodrigues, et al. In architecture he was personally involved in drawing up the plans of the cathedral of Belgaum. He conducted an exhibition on Indian Christian art for the Holy Year of 1950 in Rome. He is acknowledged to be the \\"Father of Christian Indian Art\\".

Example The rational numbers as an linearly ordered set are a densely ordered set in this sense, as are the algebraic numbers, the real numbers, the dyadic rationals and the decimal fractions. In fact, every Archimedean ordered ring extension of the integers \\\\mathbb{Z}[x] is a densely ordered set. On the other hand, the linear ordering on the integers is not dense. Uniqueness Georg Cantor proved that every two non-empty dense totally ordered countable sets without lower or upper bounds are order- isomorphic.. In particular, there exists an order-isomorphism between the rational numbers and other densely ordered countable sets including the dyadic rationals and the algebraic numbers. The proof of this result uses the back- and-forth method.. Minkowski's question mark function can be used to determine the order isomorphisms between the quadratic algebraic numbers and the rational numbers, and between the rationals and the dyadic rationals.

The STA provides an estimate of a neuron's linear receptive field. It is a useful technique for the analysis of electrophysiological data. Diagram showing how the STA is calculated. A stimulus (consisting here of a checkerboard with random pixels) is presented, and spikes from the neuron are recorded. The stimuli in some time window preceding each spike (here consisting of 3 time bins) are selected (color boxes) and then averaged (here just summed for clarity) to obtain the STA. The STA indicates that this neuron is selective for a bright spot of light just before the spike, located in the top left corner of the checkerboard. Mathematically, the STA is the average stimulus preceding a spike.de Boer and Kuyper (1968) Triggered Correlation. IEEE Transact. Biomed. Eng., 15:169-179Marmarelis, P. Z. and Naka, K. (1972).

Gazzaniga (Ed.) The Cognitive Neurosciences, III (pp. 327-338). MIT press. To compute the STA, the stimulus in the time window preceding each spike is extracted, and the resulting (spike-triggered) stimuli are averaged (see diagram). The STA provides an unbiased estimate of a neuron's receptive field only if the stimulus distribution is spherically symmetric (e.g., Gaussian white noise).Paninski, L. (2003).

Neural Computation 16:223-250 The STA has been used to characterize retinal ganglion cells,Sakai and Naka (1987).Meister, Pine, and Baylor (1994). neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus and simple cells in the striate cortex (V1) .Jones and Palmer (1987).McLean and Palmer (1989). It can be used to estimate the linear stage of the linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) cascade model. The approach has also been used to analyze how transcription factor dynamics control gene regulation within individual cells. Spike-triggered averaging is also commonly referred to as ‚Äúreverse correlation‚Ä≥ or ‚Äúwhite-noise analysis‚Äù. The STA is well known as the first term in the Volterra kernel or Wiener kernel series expansion.Lee and Schetzen (1965). Measurement of the Wiener kernels of a non- linear system by cross-correlation. International Journal of Control, First Series, 2:237-254 It is closely related to linear regression, and identical to it in common circumstances.  Mathematical Definition =Standard STA Let \\\\mathbf{x_i} denote the spatio-temporal stimulus vector preceding the i'th time bin, and y_i the spike count in that bin. The stimuli can be assumed to have zero mean (i.e., E[\\\\mathbf{x}]=0). If not, it can be transformed to have zero-mean by subtracting the mean stimulus from each vector. The STA is given : \\\\mathrm{STA} = \\\\tfrac{1}{n_{sp}}\\\\sum_{i=1}^T y_i \\\\mathbf{x_i}, where n_{sp} = \\\\sum y_i, the total number of spikes. This equation is more easily expressed in matrix notation: let X denote a matrix whose i'th row is the stimulus vector \\\\mathbf{x_i^T} and let \\\\mathbf{y} denote a column vector whose ith element is y_i. Then the STA can be written : \\\\mathrm{STA} = \\\\tfrac{1}{n_{sp}} X^T \\\\mathbf{y}. Whitened STA If the stimulus is not white noise, but instead has non-zero correlation across space or time, the standard STA provides a biased estimate of the linear receptive field. It may therefore be appropriate to whiten the STA by the inverse of the stimulus covariance matrix. This resolves the spatial dependency issue, however we still assume the stimulus is temporally independent. The resulting estimator is known as the whitened STA, which is given by : \\\\mathrm{STA}_w = \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{T}\\\\sum_{i=1}^T\\\\mathbf{x_i}\\\\mathbf{x_i}^T\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{n_{sp}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^T y_i \\\\mathbf{x_i}\\\\right), where the first term is the inverse covariance matrix of the raw stimuli and the second is the standard STA. In matrix notation, this can be written : \\\\mathrm{STA}_w = \\\\tfrac{T}{n_{sp}} \\\\left(X^TX\\\\right)^{-1}X^T \\\\mathbf{y}. The whitened STA is unbiased only if the stimulus distribution can be described by a correlated Gaussian distribution (correlated Gaussian distributions are elliptically symmetric, i.e. can be made spherically symmetric by a linear transformation, but not all elliptically symmetric distributions are Gaussian). This is a weaker condition than spherical symmetry. The whitened STA is equivalent to linear least-squares regression of the stimulus against the spike train. Regularized STA In practice, it may be necessary to regularize the whitened STA, since whitening amplifies noise along stimulus dimensions that are poorly explored by the stimulus (i.e., axes along which the stimulus has low variance). A common approach to this problem is ridge regression. The regularized STA, computed using ridge regression, can be written : \\\\mathrm{STA}_{ridge} = \\\\tfrac{T}{n_{sp}} \\\\left(X^TX + \\\\lambda I\\\\right)^{-1}X^T \\\\mathbf{y}, where I denotes the identity matrix and \\\\lambda is the ridge parameter controlling the amount of regularization. This procedure has a simple Bayesian interpretation: ridge regression is equivalent to placing a prior on the STA elements that says they are drawn i.i.d. from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with covariance proportional to the identity matrix. The ridge parameter sets the inverse variance of this prior, and is usually fit by cross-validation or empirical Bayes. Statistical Properties For responses generated according to an LNP model, the whitened STA provides an estimate of the subspace spanned by the linear receptive field. The properties of this estimate are as follows Consistency The whitened STA is a consistent estimator, i.e., it converges to the true linear subspace, if # The stimulus distribution P(\\\\mathbf{x}) is elliptically symmetric, e.g., Gaussian. (Bussgang's theorem) # The expected STA is not zero, i.e., nonlinearity induces a shift in the spike-triggered stimuli. Optimality The whitened STA is an asymptotically efficient estimator if # The stimulus distribution P(\\\\mathbf{x}) is Gaussian # The neuron's nonlinear response function is the exponential, exp(x). For arbitrary stimuli, the STA is generally not consistent or efficient. For such cases, maximum likelihood and information- based estimators Kouh M. & Sharpee, T.O. (2009). Estimating linear-nonlinear models using R√©nyi divergences, Network: Computation in Neural Systems 20(2): 49‚Äì68 have been developed that are both consistent and efficient.

After careful study of the expedition's journals and of the geography of the Columbia River estuary, Ziak discovered the previously unknown fact that from November 7, 1805 to December 6, the Lewis and Clark expedition stayed in what is now Pacific County, along the Long Beach Peninsula. This finding took six years for Ziak to piece together, using the comments in the expedition's journals to find the locations the explorers stopped at on their trip. A controversy arose between Oregon, long considered the end of the expedition, and Washington's historians over Ziak's findings, with many historians in Washington and elsewhere supporting his discovery and many in Oregon opposing it. In 1999, soon after his announcement, Ziak and David Nicandri, director of the Washington State Historical Society, began petitioning to give the newly found ending location, a camping spot called Station Camp, National Landmark Status. In addition, that year, US Representative Brian Baird had an amendment passed that changed the \\"federal designation of the Lewis and CLark National Historic Trail as ending not in Oregon but in Oregon and Washington.\\" In 2004, Ziak testified before Congress in support of the Lewis and Clark National Historical Park.

N. Annadurai. Dravida Nadu is the name of a hypothetical \\"sovereign state\\" demanded by Justice Party led by E. V. Ramasamy and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) led by C. N. Annadurai for the speakers of the Dravidian languages in South India. Initially, the demand of Dravida Nadu proponents was limited to Tamil-speaking region, but later, it was expanded to include other Indian states with Dravidian-language speakers in majority (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Karnataka). Some of the proponents also included parts of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Orissa and Maharashtra. Other names for the proposed sovereign state included \\"South India\\", \\"Deccan Federation\\" and \\"Dakshinapath\\". The movement for Dravida Nadu was at its height from the 1940s to 1960s, but due to fears of Tamil hegemony, it failed to find any support outside Tamil Nadu. The States Reorganisation Act 1956, which created linguistic States, weakened the demand further. In 1960, the DMK leaders decided to delete the demand of Dravida Nadu from the party programme at a meeting held in the absence of Annadurai. In 1963, the Government of India led by Jawaharlal Nehru, declared secessionism as an illegal act. As a consequence, Annadurai abandoned the \\"claim\\" for Dravida Nadu ‚Äì now geographically limited to modern Tamil Nadu ‚Äì completely in 1963. Background Southern portion of the Madras Presidency in 1909 The concept of Dravida Nadu had its root in the anti-Brahminism movement in Tamil Nadu, whose aim was to end the alleged Brahmin dominance in the Tamil society and government. The early demands of this movement were social equality, and greater power and control. However, over the time, it came to include a separatist movement, demanding a sovereign state for the Tamil people. The major political party backing this movement was the Justice Party, which came to power in the Madras Presidency in 1921. Since the late 19th century, the anti-Brahmin Tamil leaders had stated that the non-Brahmin Tamils were the original inhabitants of the Tamil-speaking region. The Brahmins, on the other hand, were described not only as oppressors, but even as a foreign power, on par with the British colonial rulers. The prominent Tamil leader, E. V. Ramasami (popularly known as \\"Periyar\\") stated that the Tamil society was free of any societal divisions before the arrival of Brahmins, whom he described as Aryan invaders. Periyar was an atheist, and considered the Indian nationalism as \\"an atavistic desire to endow the Hindu past on a more durable and contemporary basis\\". The proponents of Dravida Nadu constructed elaborate historical anthropologies to support their theory that the Dravidian-speaking areas once had a great non-Brahmin polity and civilisation, which had been destroyed by the Aryan conquest and Brahmin hegemony. This led to an idealisation of the ancient Tamil society before its contact with the \\"Aryan race\\", and led to a surge in the Tamil nationalism. Periyar expounded the Hindu epic Ramayana as a disguised historical account of how the Aryans subjugated the Tamils ruled by Ravana. Some of the separatists also posed Saivism as an indigenous, even non-Hindu religion. The Indian National Congress, a majority of whose leaders were Brahmins, came to be identified as a Brahmin party. Periyar, who had joined Congress in 1919, became disillusioned with what he considered as the Brahminic leadership of the party. The link between Brahmins and Congress became a target of the growing Tamil nationalism. In 1925, E.V.Ramasamy launched the Self-respect movement, and by 1930, he was formulating the most radical \\"anti-Aryanism\\". The rapport between the Justice Party and the Self-Respect movement of E.V.Ramasamy (who joined the party in 1935) strengthened the anti-Brahmin and anti-North sentiment. In 1937‚Äì38, Hindi and Hindustani were introduced as new subjects in the schools, when C. Rajagopalachari of Congress became the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency. This led to widespread protests in the Tamil-speaking region, which had a strong independent linguistic identity. Periyar saw the Congress imposition of Hindi in government schools as further proof of an Aryan conspiracy. Characteristics and precursors At the 14th Confederation of the Justice Party held in Madras in 1938, rules and regulations, or precursors of a Dravida Nadu were adopted. The objectives were defined as: to attain Purna Swaraj and complete control for Dravida Nadu in social, economic and industrial, and commercial fields; to liberate Dravida Nadu and Dravidians from exploitation and domination by non-Dravidian foreigners; to acquire for the citizens of Dravida Nadu without discrimination on account of caste and class and inequalities arising there from, in law and society, equal rights and equal opportunities; to remove from the Dravidian people the sense of difference and superstitious beliefs existing in the name of religion, customs, and traditions and unite them as a society of people with a liberal outlook and intellectual development, and to get proportionate representation in all fields till the achievement of these objectives and until the people who have a sense of caste, religious and class differences cooperate with the party in full confidence and goodwill. Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, p. 87. Thus, Periyar also stated that \\"Self Respect should come before self-rule\\".Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Periyar, p. 27. The characteristics of the separate Dravida Nadu was described by E.V.Ramasamy as: the area then comprising Madras Presidency; system of passport to enter the state; duty on goods from other provinces and entry with permit; demarcation of boundaries according to the needs and convenience of Dravida Nadu; and continuing an existing system of defence till grant of full independence. He also assured religious freedom to Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and others within this area.Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, p. 93. On the same accord, the separation of religion and politics was a part of this leaving religion as a matter of individual belief. It was made clear that the political movement should not be used for religious propaganda.Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, p. 98. Justice Party  E.V.Ramasamy with Jinnah and Ambedkar. Bombay, 6 January 1940 In December 1938, the Justice Party Convention passed a resolution stressing Tamil people's right to a separate sovereign state, under the direct control of the Secretary of State for India in London. In 1939, E.V.Ramasamy organised the Dravida Nadu Conference for the advocacy of a separate, sovereign and federal republic of Dravida Nadu. In a speech on 17 December 1939, he raised the slogan \\"Dravida Nadu for Dravidians\\", which replaced the earlier slogan \\"Tamil Nadu for Tamils\\". In 1940, the South Indian Liberal Federation (Justice Party) passed a resolution demanding a sovereign state of Dravida Nadu. E.V.Ramasamy was clear about the concept of a separate multi-linguistic nation, comprising Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada areas, that is roughly corresponding to the then existing Madras Presidency with adjoining areas into a federation guaranteeing protection of minorities, including religious, linguistic, and cultural freedom of the people. The proposition was made with a view to safeguarding the national self-respect of Dravidians threatened by Indo-Aryan culture, language, political leadership, and business interests. A separatist conference was held in June 1940 at Kanchipuram when Periyar released the map of the proposed Dravida Nadu. With the promised grant of full self-government after World War II, and posed another threat to the Indian Freedom Movement However, it failed to get British approval. On the contrary, Periyar received sympathy and support from people such as Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah for his views on the Congress, and for his opposition to Hindi. They then decided to convene a movement to resist the Congress.Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, pp. 89 & 90. By the 1940s, E.V.Ramasamy supported Muslim League's claim for a separate Pakistan, and expected its support in return. In an interview with the Governor of Madras, Jinnah, the main leader of Muslim League, said that India should be divided into four regions: Dravidistan, Hindustan, Bangalistan and Pakistan; Dravidistan would approximately consist of the area under the Madras Presidency. Jinnah stated \\"I have every sympathy and shall do all to help, and you establish Dravidistan where the 7 per cent Muslim population will stretch its hands of friendship and live with you on lines of security, justice and fairplay.\\" In July 1940, a secession committee was formed at the Dravida Nadu Secession Conference held in Kanchipuram. On 24 August 1940, the Tiruvarur Provincial Conference resolved that Dravda Nadu should be an independent state (thani-naadu). The proponents of Dravida Nadu also sought to associate and amalgamate Tamil Islam within a supposedly more ancient Dravidian religion, which threatened the Islamic identity of Tamil Muslims, some of whom had earlier supported the demand for a sovereign Dravida Nadu movement. Dravida Nadu ‚Äì Tamil magazine founded in 1942 by C. N. Annadurai In August 1941, E.V.Ramasamy declared that the agitation for Dravida Nadu was being temporarily stopped. The reason cited was that it was necessary to help the government in its war efforts. The agitation would be renewed after the conclusion of the war. Even though the agitation for Dravida Nadu was being stopped, the demand was very much intact. When the Cripps Mission visited India, a delegation of the Justice Party, comprising E.V.Ramasamy, W. P. A. Soundarapandian Nadar, Samiappa Mudaliar and Muthiah Chettiar, met the members of the Cripps Mission on 30 March 1942, and placed before them the demand for a separate Dravidian nation.Chatterjee, Up Against Caste: Comparative study of Ambedkar and Periyar, p. 43. The demand was rebuffed by Cripps, who told them that such a demand would be possible only through a resolution in the Madras legislature or through a general referendum. In August 1944, E.V.Ramasamy created a new party called Dravidar Kazhagam out of the Justice Party, at the Salem Provincial Conference. The creation of a separate non-Brahmin Dravidian nation was a central aim of the party. In 1944, when E.V.Ramasamy met the Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar to discuss join initiatives, Ambedkar stated that the idea of Dravidistan was applicable to entire India, since \\"Brahminism\\" was \\"a problem for the entire subcontinent\\". At the Dravidar Kazhagam State Conference in Tiruchi in the 1940s, prominent Tamil leader C. N. Annadurai stated that it was necessary to divide India racially to prevent \\"violent revolutions\\" in future, that according to him, had been prevented due to the British occupation of India. On 1 July 1947, the separatist Tamil leaders celebrated the \\"Dravida Nadu Secession Day\\". On 13 July 1947, they passed a resolution in Tiruchirapalli demanding an independent Dravida Nadu. On 16 July, Mahatma Gandhi expressed his opposition to the demand. Also in 1947, Jinnah refused to help E.V.Ramasamy to help create a Dravidastan. When India achieved Independence in August 1947, Periyar saw it as a sad event that marked the transfer of power to \\"Aryans\\", while Annadurai considered as a step towards an independent Dravida Nadu, and celebrated it. Over the time, disputes arose between the two leaders. They fell out after Periyar anointed his young wife as his successor to lead the party, superseding senior party leaders. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Front page of the Dravida Nadu magazine dated 29 September 1946. It depicts Periyar E. V. Ramasamy and his speech in the court during the Anti-Hindi Agitations of 1937‚Äì40 In 1949, Annadurai and other leaders split up and established Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Annadurai was initially more radical than Periyar in his demand for a separate Dravida Nadu. In highlighting the demand for Dravida Nadu, the economics of exploitation by the Hindi-speaking, Aryan, Brahminical North was elaborated upon. It was contended that Dravida Nadu had been transformed into a virtual marketplace for north Indian products. And, thus, Annadurai explained that to change this situation, a separate Dravida Nadu must be demanded. Throughout the 1940s, E.V.Ramasamy spoke along the lines of a trifurcation of India, that is dividing the existing geographical region into Dravida Nadu, Muslim India (Pakistan), and Aryan Land (Hindustan). In public meetings that he addressed between March and June 1940, he projected the three-nation doctrine as the only solution which could end the political impasse in the country.Chatterjee, Debi, [January 1981](2004) Up Against Caste: Comparative study of Ambedkar and Periyar. Rawat Publications: Chennai, p. 42. In 1950, E.V.Ramasamy stated that Dravida Nadu, if it comes into being, will be a friendly and helpful state to India.E. V. Ramaswami. Republic Supplement, 26 January 1950. Quoted in When the political power in Tamil Nadu shifted to the non-Brahmin K. Kamaraj in the 1950s, EVR's DK supported the Congress ministry. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Dravida Nadu proponents changed their demand for an independent Dravida Nadu to an independent Tamil Nadu, as they did not receive any support from the non-Tamil Dravidian-speaking states. Periyar changed the banner in his magazine Viduthalai from \\"Dravida Nadu for Dravidians\\" to \\"Tamil Nadu for Tamils\\". The reorganisation of the Indian states along linguistic lines through the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 weakened the separatist movement. In June‚ÄìJuly 1956, the founder of Kazhagam, E. V. Ramaswamy, declared that he had given up the goal of Dravidistan. However, by this time, DMK had taken over from DK as the main bearer of the separatist theme. Unlike Khalistan and other separatist movements in Republic of India, DMK never considered violence as a serious option to achieve a separate Dravida Nadu. DMK's slogan of Dravida Nadu found no support in any state of India other than Tamil Nadu. The non-Tamil Dravidian speakers perceived the ambitions of the Tamil politicians as hegemonic, ultimately leading to the failure of the Dravida Nadu concept. C. Rajagopalachari, the former Chief Minister of Madras State and a Tamil Brahmin, stated that the DMK plea for Dravida Nadu should not be taken seriously. Decline DMK leaders K. A. Mathialagan, V. P. Raman, C. N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi with Rajaji The decline in support for the Dravida Nadu within the DMK can be traced back to as early as the Tiruchi party conference in 1956, when the party decided to compete in the Tamil Nadu state assembly elections of 1957. E.V.K. Sampath, who was leading a faction within DMK, argued that Dravida Nadu was \\"not feasible\\". However, the party did state Dravida Nadu as a \\"long-range goal\\" during the elections. The political observers doubted the seriousness of their demand for a sovereign state, and stated that the demand for a separate Dravida Nadu was just a side issue, and a slogan to catch the imagination of an emotional public. In the 1957 elections, DMK managed to win only 15 of the 205 seats in the state assembly. In 1958, V. P. Raman, a Brahmin leader, joined the party and became a strong opponent of the Dravida Nadu concept. In November 1960, the DMK leaders, including Raman, decided to delete the demand of Dravida Nadu from the party programme at a meeting held in absence of Annadurai. Political scientist Sten Widmalm writes, \\"It seems that the more the party distanced itself from the demand for Dravida Nadu, the more it was supported.\\" In the 1962 election, DMK more than tripled its seats, winning 50 seats to the State Legislative Assembly, but still could not displace the Congress from power. On 17 September 1960, a \\"Dravida Nadu Separation Day\\" was observed, which resulted in arrests of Annadurai and his associates. The demand for a sovereign Tamil state was considered as a threat of Balkanization to India, and also raised concerns among the Sinhalese politicians in Sri Lanka. In 1962, a Sinhalese M.P. stated in the Parliament: \\"The Sinhalese are the minority in Dravidistan. We are carrying on a struggle for our national existence against the Dravidistan majority.\\"Sri Lanka, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), vol. 48, col. 1313, 3 September 1962. Quoted in Annadurai, who had been elected to the upper house of Indian parliament (Rajya Sabha) in 1962, reiterated DMK's demand for independence for Dravida Nadu in his maiden speech on 1 May 1962. However, at the time of Sino-Indian War of 1962, he proclaimed that his party would stand up for the integrity and unity of India. A faction of DMK contended that the party should publicly abandon the demand for Dravida Nadu. In 1963, on the recommendation of the Committee on National Integration and Regionalism of the National Integration Council, the Indian parliament unanimously passed the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which sought to \\"prevent the fissiparous, secessionist tendency in the country engendered by regional and linguistic loyalties and to preserve the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity\\" of India. This was essentially in response to the separatist movement demanding a sovereign Dravidistan. At a party conference in 1963, DMK formally dropped the secessionist demand, but also asserted that it would continue to address the issues that led it to frame its demand for separation earlier. The Sino-Indian war does not seem to be a decisive factor in dropping the demand for Dravida Nadu; prominent DMK leaders Era Sezhiyan and Murasoli Maran have stated that the demand for Dravida Nadu had been dropped in practice before 1962. Maran explained that there was not really enough support for Dravida Nadu in Tamil Nadu at the time, and it was concluded that there was no use pursuing the demand. He declared \\"I am Tamil first but I am also an Indian. Both can exist together provided there is space for cultural nationalism.\\" Era Sezhiyan declared that it was impossible to continue to demand Dravida Nadu when the policy lacked support even in the Tamil-speaking areas, let alone Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam-speaking areas. Sezhiyan was a member of the committee that wrote the new party programme, which omitted the demand for Dravida Nadu. Sezhiyan stated that it was more practical to demand a higher degree of autonomy for Tamil Nadu instead. After DMK decided to relinquish its demand for Dravida Nadu, it devoted more attention to the language issue (anti-Hindi agitations), and the 1962 election figures were almost exactly reversed in the subsequent 1967 elections. In 1962, the Congress had won the majority of seats, while DMK managed to win only 50 seats. In 1967, DMK won a clear majority of 138 seats, while Congress won only 50 seats. DMK came to power with Annadurai as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Resurgence In the 1980s, a minor militant organisation called Tamil Nadu Liberation Army revived the demand for Dravida Nadu, when the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) was sent to Sri Lanka. In 2017, when the Indian Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change issued a notification banning the sale of cattle for slaughter, Twitter users from the Kerala state (where beef dishes are popular) protested by trending the hashtag #DravidaNadu. The hashtag also received support from Twitter users in Tamil Nadu.Twitterati in Kerala rakes up #DravidaNadu over 'beef ban' The major national political parties refused to support secessionist sentiments.South India‚Äôs mini rebellion over Modi‚Äôs new cattle law kindles an old secessionist spark Several heads of South Indian states and politicians expressed dismay over the Union Government's arrangements of tax revenue distribution to various states, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader M.

When the antenna is not situated close to the transmitter, special transmission lines are required. bushing The most common type of transmission line for this purpose is large-diameter coaxial cable. At high-power transmitters, cage lines are used. Cage lines are a kind of overhead line similar in construction to coaxial cables. The interior conductor is held by insulators mounted on a circular device in the middle. On the circular device, there are wires for the other pole of the line. insulator Cage lines are used at high-power transmitters in Europe, like longwave transmitter Topolna, longwave- transmitter Solec Kujawski and some other high-power transmitters for long-, medium- and shortwave. For UHF and VHF, Goubau lines are sometimes used. They consist of an insulated single wire mounted on insulators. On a Goubau line, the wave travels as longitudinal currents surrounded by transverse EM fields. For microwaves, waveguides are used.

Kentucky Equality Federation is a member of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA). Name Originally called Kentucky Equal Rights, the organization changed its name to Kentucky Equality, with either \\"Association\\" or \\"Federation\\" always appearing afterward. Kentucky Equality has \\"The Equality Party\\", \\"Commonwealth Equality\\", \\"Kentucky Equality Federation\\", and \\"Kentucky Equality Association\\" listed as assumed names with the Kentucky Secretary of State. Mission Kentucky Equality Federation believes all people are endowed with inalienable rights to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment free from oppression, discrimination, school bullying, and hate crimes regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, race, creed, veteran status, political affiliation, or any other defining characteristic. The end of discrimination is not simply the elimination of flagrant abuses, rather it is the ability of a person to fully exercise their Kentucky human rights to the same full extent enjoyed by their peers, without fear of retribution, aspersion, or harm, be that harm political or social. Kentucky Equality Federation assists and acts as public advocate for people who have been bullied, discriminated against, or victimized in addition to assisting them with legal remedies. When the laws have not caught up to the moral needs of society, we will seek their modification, pursuant to the creation of a just society.

Activities and history In March 2007 the Kentucky Equality Federation won a MySpace Impact Award (since 2006) in the area of Social Justice, beating Do Something and Loose Change to Loosen Change. The Federation was awarded a $10,000.00 cash prize and promotional support from MySpace. Boone County High School Kentucky Equality was involved getting the first Gay-Straight Alliance approved at Boone County High School in Northern Kentucky. On July 19, 2006 Boone County High School ended more than a year of stonewalling and avoided a federal and state lawsuit by finally approving the formation of a Gay-Straight Alliance. Jordan Palmer, founder and president of the Kentucky Equality Federation warned school officials that he would file a lawsuit in federal court for violating the federal Equal Access Act which requires schools to treat Gay-Straight Alliance's as they would any other school group, and a separate lawsuit with the Kentucky Court of Justice for violating the Kentucky Education Reform Act. Incident with Representative Fischer Prior to the November 2006 General Election Kentucky Equality Federation President Jordan Palmer verbally attacked Kentucky Representative Joseph Fisher (R) after he stated \\"homosexuals have not experienced the same type of insidious discrimination in housing and employment as blacks and women.\\" In addition, Fischer stated he believed homosexuals could easily change their sexual orientation.By Kevin Eigelbach, Post staff reporter. (25 October 2006) Representative Fischer's (R) statement upsets gays Kentucky Enquirer. Accessed 14 July 2007. Complaint resolution and public advocate On September 7, 2006 the Kentucky Equality Federation announced they would act as a \\"buffer\\" for victims of discrimination, hate crimes, and school bullying establishing a toll-free number, (877) KEF-5775 and an online complaint system to report incidents. The federation stated they believe a lot of incidents go unreported each year throughout Kentucky because of bad experiences in working with law enforcement, while others feared being \\"outed\\" or reprisals would ensue from their perpetrators. Relationship with Kentucky Fairness Alliance On January 9, 2008 Kentucky Equality Federation's General Advisory Council condemned Kentucky Fairness Alliance.Herald Leader Frankfort Bureau (09 January 2008) One state gay rights group breaks ties with another; leadership of Fairness Alliance blamed Lexington Herald-Leader. Accessed 11 January 2008. queerty.com (09 January 2008) Drama destroys activist coalition in Kentucky; No Alliance for Federation Queerty. Accessed 11 January 2008. According to published reports, one reason for the dispute between the two organizations was related to Bluegrass Fairness of Central Kentucky, once a chapter of Kentucky Fairness Alliance. Kentucky Equality Federation's General Advisory Council also cited problems in working with the Executive Director of Kentucky Fairness Alliance. The condemnation was short lived; on April 18, 2008 Kentucky Equality Federation's Board of Directors rescinded the General Advisory Council's condemnation of Kentucky Fairness Alliance and terminated 9 of the 14 members on the General Advisory Council. University of the Cumberlands Kentucky Equality led a protest at the Governor's Annual Derby Breakfast on May 6, 2006. The protest was in response to Governor Ernie Fletcher's refusal to veto funding to the University of the Cumberlands after expelling a student for revealing he was gay on the social networking site MySpace. On July 7, 2009 Kentucky Equality Federation condemned the University of the Cumberlands for uninviting the Broadway Baptist Church of Texas' church choir from participating in its community based Mountain Outreach Program because of their \\"tolerant stance toward homosexuality.\\" The following day Kentucky Equality Federation also condemned $1.2 million in federal funding to expand programs at the university. Federal hate crime conviction On March 15, 2012, the Kentucky State Police assisted the FBI in arresting David Jenkins, Anthony Jenkins, Mable Jenkins, and Alexis Jenkins of Partridge, Kentucky for the beating of Kevin Pennington during a late-night attack in April 2011 at Kingdom Come State Park, near Cumberland. The push came from the gay-rights group Kentucky Equality Federation, whose president, Jordan Palmer, began lobbying Washington, D.C. to prosecute after stating he had no confidence in the Harlan County Commonwealth's Attorney to act. \\"I think the case's notoriety may have derived in large part from the Kentucky Equality Federation efforts,\\" said Kerry Harvey, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Mable Jenkins and Alexis Jenkins plead guilty. Billboard removal On May 25, 2012, a controversial billboard condemning homosexuality and abortion was posted on New Circle Road near Leestown Road in Lexington, KY. That same billboard was later stolen, defaced, and displayed in a local Lexington eatery. The billboard owner replaced the billboard shortly thereafter. The Kentucky Equality Federation, after receiving a complaint, took action. On July 31, 2012, the billboard was confirmed as removed citing complaints launched by Jordan Palmer, President, and Brandon Combs, Chairman of the Board. Marriage equality lawsuit On September 10, 2013 the Kentucky Equality Federation sued the Commonwealth of Kentucky in Franklin Circuit Court claiming Kentucky's 2004 Constitutional Amendment banning same- sex marriage violated sections of the commonwealth's constitution. Case # 13-CI-1074 was assigned by the Franklin County Court Clerk (the location of the Kentucky State Capitol). The lawsuit was conceived by President Jordan Palmer, written and signed by Vice President of Legal Jillian Hall, Esq. Jordan Palmer stated to the media that: =Ruling= On April 16, 2015, Kentucky Equality Federation v. Beshear also known as Kentucky Equality Federation v. Commonwealth of Kentucky was ruled on by Franklin County Circuit Court Judge Thomas D. Wingate. Judge Wingate sided with Kentucky Equality Federation against the Commonwealth and struck down Kentucky Constitutional Amendment banning same-sex marriages. Judge Wingate also struck down all laws passed by the Kentucky General Assembly. At the request of Governor Steve Beshear's legal representation, the Judge also placed a stay on the order pending a ruling from a Kentucky appellate court (such as the Kentucky Court of Appeals or Kentucky's court of last resort, the Kentucky Supreme Court) or the U.S. Supreme Court. The lawsuit was a significant victory for the Kentucky Equality Federation and the same-sex marriage civil rights movement. .

Mission The mission of the California State Student Association (CSSA) is to maintain and enhance the accessibility of an affordable quality education for the people of California, to the California State University. CSSA is the recognized voice for over 450,000 students in the California State University System (CSU), the CSSA is the acknowledged statewide student organization designed to represent, serve and protect the collective interests of students in the CSU system.CSSA Constitution. Revised and Approved by the Board on September 19, 2010. History In 1958, three years before the formation of the California State University (CSU) system, a group of Associated Students presidents founded the Student Presidents Association. This group initially served mostly as an informational forum for the campus student associations, but the fact that a well-organized statewide student association was firmly established when the CSU was founded ensured that the students had a place in the CSU's internal policy making from the beginning. The Student Presidents Association was formally recognized by the CSU Board of Trustees in 1963, three years after the formation of the system itself and two months after the statewide Academic Senate held its very first meeting. The 1970s saw a revival in student governance in the CSU that carried through to the present day. In 1972 the Student Presidents Association sponsored legislation which authorized the expenditure of student body fees to fund a lobbyist for CSU students.Governmental affairs representatives; California Education Code Section 89300. The bill passed the legislature and was signed into law by then Governor Reagan. By 1974, the student leadership had moved beyond the activism of the 1960s to become more articulate, intelligent, and politically astute. The student leaders of this era were quite successful both in the legislature and within the system, and are responsible for much of the foundation of student leadership that still exists today. Through their successes with Governor Brown and many legislators, they started the tradition of seeking victories in the legislature if they are not forthcoming from the system. By 1979 CSSA had become extraordinarily active, and many student body presidents were finding it difficult to fulfill both their campus and CSSA responsibilities and thus began appointing CSSA representatives (a few campuses had already started electing separate representatives). The Association decided to recognize this reality by renaming itself the California State Student Association in 1979. In 2005, CSSA successfully lobbied for an 8% student fee freeze for the CSU that the Governor included in his January budget.\\"Student Advocacy and the CSU Budget.\\" The CSSA Review. Volume II, Number 3. November 2006. In 2009, the California State University faced a $584 million budget cut. The Board of Trustees and the Office of the Chancellor responded by implementing furloughs and work force reductions, a total fee increase of approximately 32%, enrollment caps anticipating a reduction of 40,000 qualified students in the next two academic years and additional campus by campus cuts to cover the remaining $190 million loss. CSSA has continued its dedication to advocacy projects for the betterment of public higher education in California. CSSA continues to maintain regular communication with the California State Legislature, the Office of the Chancellor and the Board of Trustees and representatives from each of the 23 campuses meet on a monthly basis. Standing Committees= Executive Committee  The duty of CSSA Executive Committee is to review, research and make recommendations on the CSSA Budget, CSSA Policies and Procedures and CSSA Personnel matters. The President, Chair, Vice President of University Affairs, Vice President of Legislative Affairs, and Vice President of Finance are voting members of the Executive Committee.CSSA Constitution, Article VIII, Section A(1)(i). The Executive Director serves as an advisor to the Executive Committee.CSSA Constitution, Article VIII, Section A(1)(j).  Legislative Affairs  The job of the Legislative Affairs Committee is to make recommendations to the CSSA board of directors on higher education issues pending in the California State Legislature. Committee members vote to recommend positions on bills and strategies for accomplishing the board's policy objectives. Since 2003, the Legislative Affairs Committee has led the way for CSSA to sponsor legislation that would curtail student fee increases and reform the state financial aid program, called Cal Grants. Members of Legislative Affairs are also leaders in engaging our own campus community on legislation that would affect students by running information-based campaigns on CSU campuses, organizing letter writing and call-in days, and working with local news outlets.‚ÄúLegislative Affairs Committee.‚Äù The CSSA Review. Volume II, Number 1. August 2006. The committee oversees the CSSA Lobby Corps program, which provides the opportunity for students to develop the leadership skills to confidently speak with state senators or assemblymembers and be engaged with civic life.\\"Student Advocacy and the CSU Budget.\\" The CSSA Review. Volume II, Number 3. November 2006.  University Affairs  Former CSSA president Michael Wiafe speaks about affordable access to higher education in 2019. The University Affairs Committee principals are to promote access, affordability and quality of instruction. In addition, the committee seeks to expanding students' role in the decisions that affect the CSU by influencing system wide issues and policies and promoting shared governance through systemwide committee representation.\\"University Affairs Committee.\\" The CSSA Review. Volume II, Number 1. August 2006. Each year these principals are carried out through a policy agenda voted on by the entire CSSA Board. The University Affair Committee creates an action plan on all policy agenda items and all 23 campuses work together to progress the student perspective and quality of education on the campus and system wide level. University Affairs activities include working with CSU and campus administrators including the Academic Senate, testifying in front of the Board of Trustees, writing resolutions and passing them on each individual campus, and implementing information campaigns on system policy or initiative. An example of CSSA activity within University Affairs would be the annual voter registration drives hosted by individual campus's to help encourage a next generation of young people to become involved in the electorate process.Maitre, Michelle. \\"College Students Register 42,000 Brand New Voters.\\" Oakland Tribune.

The committee insures that members of the California State Student Association derive the maximum benefit from their association by ensuring that the board stays focused on student issues.CSSA Constitution, Article VIII, Section A(4).  Social Justice and Equity Committee  The Social Justice and Equity Committee is an official ongoing force of the CSSA to advance and monitor the further development of programs and policies regarding the maintenance and enhancement of the diversity, social justice, and equity within the CSU system and campus communities. Student leaders express their concerns about the need to build supportive rather than hateful environments on CSU campuses and adopt resolutions which recognize these concerns and request the administration to take proactive steps to foster a welcoming and supportive environment.\\"Multicultural Caucus.\\" The CSSA Review.

It is an intramembrane aspartyl protease with the conserved active site motifs 'YD' and 'GxGD' in adjacent transmembrane domains (TMDs). Its sequences is highly conserved in different vertebrate species. SPP cleaves remnant signal peptides left behind in membrane by the action of signal peptidase and also plays key roles in immune surveillance and the maturation of certain viral proteins. Biological function Physiologically SPP processes signal peptides of classical MHC class I preproteins. A nine amino acid-long cleavage fragment is then presented on HLA-E receptors and modulates the activity of natural killer cells. SPP also plays a pathophysiological role; it cleaves the structural nucleocapsid protein (also known as core protein) of the Hepatitis C virus and thus influences viral reproduction rate. In mice, a nonamer peptide originating from the SPP protein serves as minor histocompatibility antigen HM13 that plays a role in transplant rejection The homologous proteases SPPL2A and SPPL2B promote the intramembrane cleavage of TNFŒ± in activated dendritic cells and might play an immunomodulatory role. For SPPL2c and SPPL3 no substrates are known. SPPs do not require cofactors as demonstrated by expression in bacteria and purification of a proteolytically active form. The C-terminal region defines the functional domain, which is in itself sufficient for proteolytic activity. Type IV leader peptidase Another family of signal aspartic endopeptidases was found in bacteria. Bacteria produce a number of protein precursors that undergo post-translational methylation and proteolysis prior to secretion as active proteins. Type IV prepilin leader peptidases are enzymes that mediate this type of post-translational modification. Type IV pilin is a protein found on the surface of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and other Gram-negative pathogens. Pilin subunits attach the infecting organism to the surface of host epithelial cells. They are synthesised as prepilin subunits, which differ from mature pilin by virtue of containing a 6-8 residue leader peptide consisting of charged amino acids. Mature type IV pilins also contain a methylated N-terminal phenylalanine residue. The bifunctional enzyme prepilin peptidase (PilD) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key determinant in both type-IV pilus biogenesis and extracellular protein secretion, in its roles as a leader peptidase and methyl transferase (MTase). It is responsible for endopeptidic cleavage of the unique leader peptides that characterise type-IV pilin precursors, as well as proteins with homologous leader sequences that are essential components of the general secretion pathway found in a variety of Gram-negative pathogens. Following removal of the leader peptides, the same enzyme is responsible for the second posttranslational modification that characterises the type-IV pilins and their homologues, namely N-methylation of the newly exposed N-terminal amino acid residue.

The Kamikaze was created when George Lynch entered an ESP shop in Tokyo while on tour looking for a replacement neck. He learned that ESP also made custom guitars, so he created the Kamikaze. The Kamikaze was the first guitar in ESP's Signature Series. Different Models Kamikaze I- Original kamikaze model with black/tan/yellow/red color scheme, ebony fretboard, maple body and neck. George Lynch's original did not have a recess cavity for the tremolo system, but it is recessed on the ESP signature Series. Kamikaze II- Same specs as the Kamikaze I with a blue/red/white color scheme, the Kamikaze II was the first kamikaze model, and therefore the first signature series guitar, that ESP has put on the market. The Kamikaze II was originally ordered by a guy who worked in a music store in Alexandria, La who wanted a Kamikaze in a different color scheme, but when his guitar arrived at 48th St in New York from Japan, George Lynch happened to be there, saw the guitar and claimed it for himself, so ESP had to make another for the guy in Louisiana. Kamikaze III- Same as others with a White/black/tan color scheme. Kamikaze IV- much different from the other models with a fluorescent color scheme, reverse sawtooth headstock (as opposed to a reverse banana).

BattleMechs (often abbreviated 'Mechs) are large walking war machines that feature prominently in the fictional universe of BattleTech. 'Mechs, which are generally either bipedal or quadrupedal in configuration, are controlled by human pilots and can thus be classified as mecha. Origins BattleMechs debuted in FASA Corporation's BattleTech, a board game of futuristic armored combat played with dice, counters and paper record sheets on a map of hexagonal territories. The game's first edition in 1984 was titled BattleDroids and featured mecha based directly on those in the Japanese animated television series Macross and other Japanese animation from the late '70s and early '80s. Legal impediments with George Lucas over the use of the term \\"droid\\" forced the name of the game to change in the second edition to BattleTech. This, combined with legal troubles with Playmates Toys, led FASA in the 1990s to remove all images of these early designs from subsequent published material. Since FASA retained the rights to all aspects of the 'Mechs except for their visual depictions, they continued to use the 'Mechs and their stats, but did not print images of them until Technical Readout: Project Phoenix canonized new artwork for the designs. This fact led fans to dub these early 'Mechs the \\"Unseen,\\" while their new look is colloquially referred to as the \\"Reseen.\\" 'Mechs in BattleTech vary from one another in many ways, including mass, speed, chassis configuration, armor and armament, resulting in a practically limitless array of legal 'Mech designs. FASA and its successors WizKids, FanPro, and Catalyst Game Labs created hundreds of official BattleMechs to complement the game, the majority published in a long-running series of \\"technical readouts\\". The game's detailed construction rules, which allow players to create legal custom units of their own, has also resulted in untold thousands of additional designs, some published in magazines, on websites, and in various other fan media. As the BattleTech franchise has grown, BattleMechs have increasingly appeared beyond the confines of the board game. A line of figurines, a collectible card game, and numerous computer simulation titles feature the machines; 'Mechs also feature centrally in a prolific series of novels set in the fictional BattleTech universe, as well as an animated spin-off television series. Backstory In the BattleTech universe, the first BattleMech ever developed was the Mackie MSK-6S, described as a 100-ton box with legs. It was developed in 2439 by the Terran Hegemony, first deployed in 2443, and produced throughout the rest of the Inner Sphere after its construction plans were stolen in 2455. Significant development and refinement of the technology followed through subsequent centuries. 'Mech advancement in the Inner Sphere crested during the reign of the Star League, but slowly degraded during the protracted conflicts of the Succession Wars. Much of the infrastructure and expertise necessary to produce the most advanced models was lost, with the result that, by the early 31st century, most Great Houses were fielding models that were centuries old. Star League-era BattleMech technology was preserved during this period of decline by a military faction later known as the Clans. Absent from the Inner Sphere for centuries, they returned in 3049 fielding 'Mechs of considerable sophistication and power. The first confirmed sighting of a Clan 'Mech by an Inner Sphere observer was that of a Timber Wolf (called the Mad Cat by Inner Sphere observers) by the legendary Phelan Kell of the Kell Hounds mercenary unit. The Clan invasion triggered a resurgence of BattleMech-related research and development, both in the Inner Sphere and among the Clans, leading to many new models being introduced during the 3050s and '60s. After the collapse of the 2nd Star League in late 3067, most Battlemech manufactures were damaged or outright destroyed by the Word of Blake Jihad (Holy War). Smaller factories retooled and began manufacturing ancient designs dating back to the Age of War when Mackie was first introduced. The creation of hybrids from these ancient designs and new technologies again led to a slow progress in 'Mech development, despite the return to all-out war and the use of nuclear weaponry.http://www.classicbattletech.com/index.php?action=text&page;=Master_Timeline However, the collapse of the hyperpulse generator network in the early 32nd century disrupted 'Mech advancement. Terminology and nomenclature The term \\"'Mech\\" broadly applies to all mecha within the BattleTech universe. BattleMechs, those that are intended for combat or related operations, are the predominant variety, with the result that the term is frequently applied to all BattleTech mecha. Non-combat models do exist, however, and are generally referred to as WorkMechs or UtilityMechs. These models tend to be specialized to perform a particular task such as harvesting, lumbering, scavenging, repair, etc. OmniMechs are a sub-class of BattleMech that mount weapons and equipment in modular \\"pods\\". The pods are easily swapped or changed, enabling engineers to customize an OmniMech's components for any given mission. With few exceptions, every major model of BattleMech bears both a name and an identifying code. Codes generally use letters from the 'Mech's name, followed by an alphanumeric reference to the submodel or variant. For example, the base model of the 70-ton Warhammer is WHM-6R, with variants WHM-6X, WHM-7A, etc. A single letter is normally used to indicate common variants of an OmniMech. Clan 'Mechs are sometimes known by two different names, one assigned by its Clan creators and one by Inner Sphere observers. An example is the 75-ton Clan Timber Wolf, known in the Inner Sphere as the Mad Cat. This practice generally ceased after the mid 3060s. Configuration BattleMechs range in height from and mass from 20 to 100 tonnes (22 to 110 short tons) in five-ton intervals, with some capable of ground speeds in excess of . Mechs have a torso that can rotate to either side independently from the legs, but few can do a complete 360 twist. Their power is drawn from fusion reactors and are best suited for ground combat, although they are also capable of limited performance underwater and in outer space. Bipedal The majority of BattleMechs are bipedal and can be classed as either humanoid or reverse-joint (\\"chicken walker\\"). Humanoid-type BattleMechs are the most common and include the iconic Atlas and Summoner (Thor). Reverse-joint 'Mechs are slightly less common on the field of battle, being quicker but less stable than the humanoid-type, but include such famous models as the Supernova, Marauder, Catapult, Timber Wolf (Mad Cat) and the Dire Wolf (Daishi). There are a few, however, with digitigrade legs that have a raised ankle and stand on their toes, like the legs of a dog, cat, etc. Examples include the Thanatos and Nova Cat. Quadrupedal Four-legged \\"quad\\" 'Mechs constitute a small segment of official designs, and while they lack the flexibility and speed of bipedal designs, they are considerably more stable and can mount heavier weaponry. Though often maligned, quads experienced a bit of a renaissance in the years after 3060 with several new models released. Notable quad designs include the 25-ton Tarantula, 55-ton Scorpion, and 70-ton Barghest. Land-Air 'Mech (LAM) LAMs are an extremely uncommon form of 'Mech capable of transforming between BattleMech and aircraft configurations, an ability that conveys great speed and flexibility at the cost of power and protection. The design of these LAMs, as well as several other 'Mechs, were leased from mecha designs used in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross and other anime series (see variable fighters); resulting real-world legal conflicts ended their official existence within the franchise. The Wasp, Stinger and Phoenix Hawk are the only published LAMs, found in the unrevised edition of Technical Readout: 3025, along with the other \\"lost\\" or \\"unseen\\" BattleMechs such as the Marauder, Crusader, Warhammer and the non-LAM versions of the Stinger, Wasp, and Phoenix Hawk. BattleMech construction BattleMechs are initially made up of a series of internal structure \\"bones\\" which are connected together to form the skeleton of the 'Mech. An electroactive polymer called myomer, which contracts in the presence of an electric current, is then wrapped around these bones. This powerful myomer transmission system is what gives BattleMechs their speed and agility in even the roughest terrain. The necessary electric current for the myomers is provided by a fusion reactor mounted in the torso. This artificial skeleton and musculature combined with a powerful gyroscope provide stability for the BattleMech. The entire system is controlled by a pilot wearing a neurohelmet that effectively links the 'Mech's central computer to the pilot's sense of balance and nervous system. The neurohelmet also gives feedback by providing a kinesthetic sense of the mech's position for better judgement of balance. The movement of a 'Mech is controlled by a combination of throttle, joysticks, and dual pedal system. All 'Mechs include a cockpit, life support, sensors, engine, gyroscope, and actuator packages. Any space left over after accounting for these components, as well as upgrades to the structure (Endo-steel) and armor (Ferro-Fibrous), may be used for heat sinks, weapon systems, ammunition, or other legal equipment. 'Mechs can carry a variety of weapons, most of which generate heat upon firing. This can become a problem in intense or prolonged fighting, as an overheating 'Mech may shut down or, in extreme cases, explode. To mitigate this, the heat is transferred into massive heat sinks, which help facilitate cooling but do not eliminate the problem entirely. Water is an effective coolant, but impairs movement.

Development of the game William Wilson, Scottish aquatics pioneer and originator of the first rules of water polo.The rules of water polo were originally developed in the mid-nineteenth century in Great Britain by William Wilson. The game originated as a form of rugby football played in rivers and lakes in England and Scotland with a ball constructed of Indian rubber, probably from the 1850s onwards. This ‚Äòwater rugby‚Äô came to be called ‚Äòwater polo‚Äô based on the English pronunciation of the Balti (Tibetan language of Kashmir) word pulu12th FINA World Championship 2007: Classroom Resource Retrieved 20 September 2007polo.

Early play allowed brute strength, wrestling and holding opposing players underwater to recover the ball; the goalie stood outside the playing area and defended the goal by jumping in on any opponent attempting to score by placing the ball on the deck. In the first edition (1893) of their book ‚ÄòSwimming‚Äô, Archibald Sinclair and William Henry state \\"On May 12, 1870, a committee was appointed by the Swimming Association, then known as the London Swimming Association, to draw up a code of rules for the management of the game of ‚Äòfootball in the water.‚Äô \\" This indicates that forms of the sport we now call ‚Äòwater polo‚Äô existed before the current name was in common use. Other names included ‚Äòwater base ball‚Äô and (more frequently) ‚Äòaquatic football‚Äô. For example, in the South Eastern Gazette (in Kent; now closed), on Tues 28 July 1857, it says \\"An aquatic foot-ball match is fixed for to-morrow, Wednesday\\". One of the earliest recorded games of a sport called ‚Äòwater polo‚Äô occurred at the Crystal Palace (London), on 15 September 1873. It was reported in the Morning Post (now closed) and The Standard (later London Evening Standard). The weather was \\"cold and raw\\" according to the Penny Illustrated News. It was held in the boating lake that still exists. It was part of the 4th Open Air Fete of the London Swimming Club (founded in 1859). The modern game also developed in Scotland in the late 19th century, when the first games of water polo were played at the Arlington Baths Club in Glasgow (the Club was founded in 1870, and still exists today). In 1886, the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association (Western) held their first championship, the West Cup. West of Scotland beat South Side 1-0. This is probably the first club tournament in the world, and is still played for today. The Swimming Association of Great Britain (SAGB; forerunner of the Amateur Swimming Association, of England) recognised the sport on 13 April 1885. Canada was one of the first countries outside the United Kingdom to adopt the sport. The Midland (of England) Counties Swimming and Aquatic Football Association probably set up the first water polo league in the world. Their first champions, in 1884, were Birmingham Leander who beat Hanley 1-0. The first national club championships (in England) were played in 1888. Burton Amateur Club defeated Otter Swimming Club 3‚Äì0 in the Old Lambert Baths in London. Burton Amateur was formed in 1878, and still exists today. Otter was formed in London in 1869; and also still exists today, with male and female water polo teams. Though originally it was a male-only swimming club. The London Water Polo League, encouraged by the Otter Club, was formed in 1889. In that year, Nautilus were the first champions, defeating Otter 2-0. The next league was the Northern Counties. Their first champions were Manchester Osborne, who beat Manchester Leaf Street 4-1, in 1892. The longest running single match is the annual one between Oxford and Cambridge universities. This first one was played on 16 October 1891, at the Old Crown Baths, Kensington Oval, London. Oxford won 4‚Äì1. The first international water polo match was between England and Scotland at the Kensington Baths in London, on 28 July 1890. Scotland won 4‚Äì0 Pro Water Polo.com: History and Development of Water Polo, by Yiannis Giannouris Retrieved 4 September 2006. The England team were F Browne, WG Carrey, HF Clark, JF Genders, William Henry, J Finegan and JL Mayger. The referee was Archibald Sinclair (who also founded the London Water Polo league) from Ranelagh Harriers, England. William Henry (1859-1928) and Archibald Sinclair (1866-1922) went on to publish a book called ‚ÄòSwimming‚Äô (Longmans & Co, London) in 1893. It included a chapter on water polo and may be the first book to have a chapter on the subject. Outside England and Scotland By the 1880s, the game stressed swimming, passing, and scoring by shooting into a goal net; players could only be tackled when holding the ball and could not be taken under water. Canada was one of the first countries outside Britain to adopt the sport. The Montreal Swimming Club which had formed in 1876 formed a water polo team in 1887 and games were played in the St. Lawrence River along the shore of St. Helen's Island. In 1888, the sport was brought to the USA, by John Robinson, an English swimming instructor; by organising a team at the Boston Athletic Association. Two years later, J.H. Smith and Arnold Heilban started a team at the Sydenham Swimmers Club (later at the Metropole AC) in Providence, Rhode Island. In the autumn of the same year (1890) the New York Athletic Club (NYAC) introduced the game to members. The first US championships were held on 28 January 1890, in Providence, when Sydenham Swimmers Club defeated Boston Athletic Association by 2:1. Water polo final at the 1908 Summer OlympicsBetween 1890 and 1900, the game developed in Europe, spreading to Hungary in 1889, Belgium in 1890, Austria and Germany in 1894 and France in 1895, using British rules. A different game was being played in the United States, characterized by rough play, holding, diving underwater, and soft, semi-inflated ball that could be gripped tightly and carried underwater. In 1900, the sport of water polo was added to the program of the Olympics ‚Äì the first team sport to be added. Due to the different codes, European teams did not compete. By 1914, most US teams agreed to conform to international rules.USA Water Polo: History of Water Polo Retrieved 4 September 2006 An international water polo committee was formed in 1929, consisting of representatives from Great America and the International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA). Rules were developed for international matches and put into effect in 1930; FINA has been the international governing body for the sport since that time. Over the years, both technical and rule changes affected the character of the game. In 1928, Hungarian water polo coach B√©la Komj√°di invented the \\"air pass,\\" or \\"dry pass\\", a technique in which a player directly passes the ball through the air to another player, who receives it without the ball hitting the water. Previously, players would let the ball drop in the water first and then reach out for it, but the dry pass made the offensive game more dynamic, and contributed to Hungarian dominance of water polo for 60 years.International Swimming Hall of Fame: Bela Komjadi In 1936, James R. (\\"Jimmy\\") Smith, California water polo coach and author of several books on water polo mechanics, developed a water polo ball made with an inflatable bladder and a rubber fabric cover, which improved performance. The previous leather ball absorbed water and became heavier during the game. In 1949, rule changes allowed play to continue uninterrupted after a referee whistled an ordinary foul, speeding up play. In the 1970s, the exclusion foul replaced a point system for major fouls; players guilty of this foul were excluded for a 1-minute penalty and their team forced to play with fewer players. Possession of the ball was limited to 45 seconds before a scoring attempt. Time of penalties and possession has been reduced since then. The direct shot on goal from the seven (7) meter line after a free throw was allowed in 1994, and changed to a five-meter shot in 2005. Local rule variations ;United States In 2006, revisions were made to the NFHS 2006‚Äì2007 swimming/diving and water polo rulebook (USWP and NCAA rules still vary). The four and seven-meter lines were merged to a five-meter line. Under the revised rules, a goalkeeper may use two hands and stand on the bottom of the pool (if shallow) until the 5-meter line, and go beyond the 5-meter line according to the field rules (one hand on the ball no standing), but still not pass the half line. The goalie may strike the ball with a clenched fist, although this is not recommended. New cap rules were also enacted. A goalie cap must now be in quarters alternating red/dark for home and red/white for away. The goalie must be number 1 or 13. For women, a red swim cap must be worn under the goalie cap. A team's dark swim cap is no longer acceptable as it is hard to distinguish a goalie from field players if official cap is off. Olympic competition 2004 Athens Olympics. Men's water polo at the Olympics was the among the first team sports introduced at the 1900 games in Paris (along with cricket, rugby, football (soccer), polo (with horses), rowing and tug of war).International Olympic Committee Water Polo Site Women's water polo became an Olympic sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games after political protests from the Australian women's team. Such protests were rewarded when Australia won the gold medal match against the United States with a \\"buzzer-beater\\" last-minute goal, taken from outside the seven-meter line. Some of the best ever include Spain's Manuel Estiarte who played in a record six Olympics and led in scoring for four of them. Dezs≈ë Gyarmati of Hungary won water polo medals at five successive Olympic Games (gold 1952, 1956, 1964; silver 1948; bronze 1960), a record in water polo.International Olympic Committee Athlete Profile: Deszo Gyarmati Another major figure in the sport was Tam√°s Farag√≥, who led Hungary to Olympic Medals in 1972, 1976 and 1980. The play of American Terry Schroeder led the United States to its first Olympic silver medals in 1984 and 1988. The most famous water polo match in history is probably the 1956 Summer Olympics semi-final match between Hungary and the Soviet Union. As the athletes left for the games, the Hungarian revolution began, and the Soviet army crushed the uprising. Many of the Hungarian athletes vowed never to return home, and felt their only means of fighting back was by victory in the pool. The confrontation was the most bloody and violent water polo game in history, in which the pool reputedly turned red from blood. The Hungarians defeated the Soviets 4‚Äì0 before the game was called off in the final minute to prevent angry Hungarians in the crowd reacting to Valentin Prokopov punching Ervin Zador's eye open. The Hungarians went on to win the Olympic gold medal by defeating Yugoslavia 2‚Äì1 in the final. Half of the Hungarian Olympic delegation defected after the games. A documentary by Lucy Liu, Freedom's Fury, premiered in April 2006, recounting the events of the 1956 Hungarian uprising and climaxing with this politicized game. International play Every 2 to 4 years since 1973, a men's Water Polo World Championship is played together with the World Swimming Championship, under the auspices of FINA. Women's water polo was added in 1986. A second tournament series, the FINA Water Polo World Cup, has been held every other year since 1979. In 2002, FINA organized the sport's first international league, the FINA Water Polo World League, in which the best national teams compete against one another in an annual season format with nearly half a million dollar purse. Internationally, the biggest water polo competition in the world is played in the Netherlands. Prince William of Wales was the captain of his collegiate water polo team at St Andrew's University, Scotland. The annual Varsity Match between Oxford and Cambridge Universities is the sport's longest running rivalry, first played in 1891.Oxford-Cambridge Water Polo: Varsity Match History Results of the major international competitions '''''' Olympic Games Hungary has been the most successful country in men's tournament, while the United States is the only team to win multiple times at the women's tournament since its introduction.

Cutino Award Today club water polo is gaining popularity in the United States. Though the majority of domestic club teams are based in California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas, New England and Missouri preparatory high schools also often field teams. Club water polo teams in the United States often compete in national championships such as Junior Olympics, National Club Championships, and the Speedo Cup. Club teams from Washington, Oregon, Utah, and Michigan were entered at the 2005 USWP Junior Olympics. Aniko Pelle (Hungary) and Sofia Konoukh (Russia) were among the first of an increasing number of international players competing in U.S. collegiate women's water polo. Because of water polo's increased popularity globally, the influence of international coaches like USC's Jovan Vavic from the former Yugoslavia, and the perks of attending an American college, international players are attracted to the premier US colleges. The 2005 Hawaii women's water polo team, coached by Canadian Michel Roy, has nine international players, the most of any team in the nation. Teams from California dominate at the collegiate level. In the United States, water polo players tend to have prestigious academic backgrounds as well. A number of players, including former USA team captain Wolf Wigo, who retired after Athens 2004, Jacqueline Frank DeLuca, bronze medal Olympic goalie, and international phenom Tony Azevedo attended Stanford University. The sport's most notable balancing act to date includes Omar Amr,US Olympic Team Biography of Omar Amr who played on the US National Team while attending Harvard Medical School and recovering from a near career ending knee injury in 2001. ;College championships In the 2008 NCAA Women's Water Polo Championship, the UCLA women beat University of Southern California 6 to 3, for their fourth consecutive championship title. In the 2007 Men's NCAA Finals, the UC Berkeley Golden Bears defended their 2006 title by defeating the No. 1-ranked USC water polo men, 8‚Äì6. The most prestigious individual water polo honor, the Peter J. Cutino Award, was established in 1999 by the San Francisco Olympic Club, and is presented annually to the top American male and female collegiate water polo player. In 2008, Tim Hutten from UC Irvine and Courtney Mathewson from UCLA won the Cutinos.

Career The Playmates, Donald Claps (a.k.a. Donny Conn) drummer and lyricist, Carl Cicchetti (a.k.a. Chic Hetti) pianist music composer and Morey Cohen (a.k.a. Morey Carr) lead vocalist were an instrumental and vocal trio, all from Waterbury, Connecticut, United States and, in the early 1950s, at the University of Connecticut. After graduation in 1952, they began touring small lounges and night clubs in the United States and Canada, originally as \\"the Nitwits\\", later as the Playmates. Signed to Roulette Records in 1958 as the label's first vocal group, and anticipating a Calypso craze, the group recorded an album called Playmates Visit the West Indies. They then released two notable Top 40 singles ‚Äî \\"Jo-Ann\\" and \\"Don't Go Home\\" ‚Äî before having a number 4 hit (July 9, 1958) with the tempo-changing novelty song \\"Beep, Beep\\", which became a regular feature for Dr. Demento. The \\"Beep, Beep\\" song was on the Billboard Top 40 chart for twelve weeks. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Concurrently with this song, American Motors (AMC) was setting production and sales records for the Rambler models. Because of a directive by the BBC at the time that songs did not include brand names in their lyrics, a version of \\"Beep Beep\\" was recorded for the European market, replacing the Cadillac and Nash Rambler with the generic terms limousine and bubble car.

One day, he passed a tiny cottage, which held two sisters, one eighty years old and the other ninety. He saw their small, delicate hands, which had kept white and soft through spinning. He thought they must belong to a beautiful woman, and told the king. The king sent him to try to see her. One of them lied, claiming to be fifteen and her sister twenty, and the king decided to marry her. She said that she had never seen a ray of sun since she was born, and being touched would turn her black; the king had to send a carriage. He did, she went, heavily veiled, and they married. Their wedding night, he saw the old woman he had married and threw her out the window, where she caught on a hook. Four fairies saw her there and mischievously gave her youth, beauty, wisdom, and a tender heart. The king saw her the next morning, thought he must have been blind, and had her rescued. Her sister came to her and plagued her for how she had become young again, until the queen said that she had had her head cut off, or, in other variants, that she had had herself skinned, and a new one had grown in its place.

A total of 4 elected members and five appointed members comprised this council. Radio broadcasts John Parker made national news bring the attention of the council to radio broadcasts from Radio Moscow that were being received with greater clarity in most of the Northwest Territories than broadcasts from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Parker emphasized the danger of northern residents falling victim to the communist propaganda as most of the Inuit did not yet identify Canada as a nation, and other northern residents being susceptible with the limited media coverage that was available in the north at the time. Reforms Commissioner Robert Gordon Robertson the who had been recently appointed in the last session made two critical reforms to the way council operated in this session that had lasting implications. The first reform was introduced at the first session held in the Elks Hall at Yellowknife. The amendment to the Rules in Council permitted members of Council to make a reply to the speech from the throne. The second reform had to do with the Commissioner's lack of Executive Council. Robertson started putting out references for advice to council members to help guide him on critical issues of the day facing the territories. He wanted an Executive Council to advise him as the Lieutenant Governors had prior to 1897 had and this method was the closest he could to achieve that. Legislation The first Legislative Session took place in the basement of the Elks Hall in Yellowknife in the spring of 1954. A total of nine bills were passed, mostly amendments to existing legislation. The second session held in Ottawa saw a total of seventeen bills passed. The biggest issue dealt with during this session was the question relating to sales of liquor for Indians and Inuit which had been prohibited under a Northwest Territories law dating back to the Temporary North-West Council. The Prohibition meant that bootlegging was common place as well as consumption of alternate forms of alcohol such as shoe polish, anti freeze and vanilla extract resulting in needless deaths and endemic social issues. After debate the council agreed to change the regulations to allow liquor privileges to be the same for everyone. The federal government however disagreed and vetoed the changes.

It lies on the route between Santiago and Chile's primary border crossing with Argentina by way of the summit of the Uspallata Pass in the Andes mountain range. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Los Andes spans an area of and has 60,198 inhabitants (30,247 men and 29,951 women). Of these, 55,388 (92%) lived in urban areas and 4,810 (8%) in rural areas. The population grew by 21% (10,451 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a municipality, Los Andes is a third-level administrative division of Chile governed by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008‚Äì2012 alcalde is Mauricio Navarro S.. The council has the following members: * Marta Yochum G. * Oscar Araya S. * Alejandro Tapia C. * Sergio Montenegro P. * Ivan Salinas S. * Julio Lobos L. Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Los Andes is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr. Marco Antonio N√∫√±ez (PDC) and Mr. Gaspar Rivas (RN) as part of the 11th electoral district, (together with San Esteban, Calle Larga, Rinconada, San Felipe, Putaendo, Santa Mar√≠a, Panquehue, Llaillay and Catemu). The commune is represented in the Senate by Ignacio Walker Prieto (PDC) and Lily P√©rez San Mart√≠n (RN) as part of the 5th senatorial constituency (Valpara√≠so-Cordillera). Economy Los Andes principal economy is based on mining and agriculture, with vineyards and grapes being the principal fruit export. Copper and other minor minerals production is handled by Codelco Chile. Until 2004, a Peugeot car plant assembled vehicles in Los Andes (Automotora Franco-Chilena). Peugeot's 404, 504, 505, 205 & 206 models were produced from French and Argentine components, being exported to other Latin American markets. Transport Los Andes stands at the beginning of the now derelict metre gauge Transandine Railway, opened in 1910, which once ran to Mendoza in Argentina, providing a link between the broad gauge line from Valparaiso to Los Andes, operated by the Chilean State Railway, and the broad gauge line from Mendoza to Buenos Aires operated by the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway. It is now being reconstructed. Due to the lack of concrete actions to restore this link, the most recent estimations are that the line could be restored around October, 2009. However, as of June 2011, there is no indication of any restorative work underway.Volvi√≥ el ferrocarril a MendozaReconstruction in Spanish  References  Populated places in Los Andes Province Communes of Chile Capitals of Chilean provinces Populated places established in 1791 1791 establishments in the Spanish Empire ","title":"Los Andes, Chile"},{"id":"6321627","text":"Pieter de Villiers may refer to: * Pieter de Villiers (athlete) (born 1982) * Pieter de Villiers (rugby union) (born 1972) * Peter de Villiers, South African rugby coach * Pieter de Villiers (politician), Namibian politician and mayor of Opuwo, Kunene Region ","title":"Pieter de Villiers"},{"id":"6321630","text":"Only the Lonely is a 1991 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Chris Columbus, and stars John Candy, Maureen O'Hara, Ally Sheedy and Anthony Quinn. The film is a comedic take on the premise established in the 1953 television play Marty and the 1955 film Marty, while the title comes from the song \\"Only the Lonely\\" by Roy Orbison. Plot Danny Muldoon, a 38-year-old Chicago policeman, still lives with his overbearing Irish mother, Rose Muldoon. A lonely bachelor, Danny falls in love with Theresa Luna, an introverted, lonely girl who works in her father's funeral home as a cosmetician. On their first date, he takes her to Comiskey Park and has a picnic on the field. Their courtship eventually becomes very difficult because Rose begins to feel threatened that Theresa is trying to steal her son away; the fact that Theresa is not Irish (she is Sicilian and Polish) only exacerbates the situation. Danny's brother Patrick tries to convince Danny to remain unmarried so that Danny and Rose can move down to Florida, where Danny can take care of her; Salvatore \\"Sal\\" Buonarte, one of Danny's married friends and a fellow police officer, tries to tell Danny that he can do better and not to settle down just yet, as he did. Because of this, Danny begins to feel guilty about his relationship with Theresa, especially towards his mother. This leads to his interrupting dates with Theresa to check on his mother. When Theresa is finally introduced to Rose at a fancy dinner, Rose immediately begins to put her down. Theresa stands up to Rose, and complains to Danny as to why he didn't stand up for her. After Theresa leaves, Danny scolds his mother for being so cruel to Theresa, saying that her way of \\"telling it like it is\\" is really her attempt to hurt people. He then reminds her that she lost a $450,000 account for his late father's company by making anti-Semitic remarks. Danny then tells Rose that he will propose to Theresa, whether she approves or not. That night, Danny apologizes to Theresa and proposes to her from the bucket of a Chicago fire truck. She says yes and the two are set to be married. However, even though Rose finally does approve of Theresa, on the night before the wedding, Danny calls to check on his mother in front of Theresa. Angered at the fact that they might never be alone, Theresa walks off. Both Danny and Theresa fail to show up for the wedding, thus, the two don't marry. A few weeks later, Danny's friends question what caused them to call off the wedding, but Danny gives no answer. When a family friend named Doyle passes away, alone with no wife or children, Danny realizes that he doesn't want to end up that way. Finally, the day Danny and Rose are scheduled to move to Florida, Danny tells Rose that he can't let Theresa go and by leaving her behind, he'd be leaving behind the best thing that ever happened to him. Reluctant at first, Rose finally agrees to Danny's plan and goes to Florida without him, instructing her son to get married, have a family and be happy. Danny then goes to Luna's Funeral Home to look for Theresa. However, her father tells him that she left for New York City by train. Danny contacts the railroad station manager, who agrees to stop the train at a suburban station outside the city. There, Danny apologizes to Theresa and proclaims his love for her. He tells her that he will move to New York with her and join the New York City Police Department. Having no more guilt about his mother, the two re-board the train for New York to live the rest of their lives together. Throughout the film, the Muldoons' Greek neighbor, Nick Acropolis - who has been encouraging Danny to pursue Theresa - attempts to woo Rose. Rose is salty towards Nick in the beginning, but as she gradually softens her stance regarding Danny's relationship with Theresa, she ultimately warms to Nick, who takes Danny's place on the flight to Florida to be with Rose.

It was built in the late 13th century and is constructed of flint with stone dressings with an old tiled roof. The west tower of 1734 is of grey brick with red dressings and is in three stages. Below the louvred bell stage, containing four bells, is a clock on the south side. The church plan consists of nave, chancel, south porch and north aisle. The gabled porch is 19th-century, as are the lean-to north aisle and chancel roof of 1876. In the chancel wall is a 14th-century chest tomb, reused as a monument to Sir Francis Sykes who died in 1804. There is a 15th-century font. The churchyard is notable as the resting place of Jethro Tull, the 18th- century farmer, whose modern gravestone can be seen there. He died in 1741 but according to his gravestone he was buried on 9 March 1740. This apparent confusion is due to the burial date being an Old Style date.

Background When Roma refugees were allowed into Canada in 1997, a protest was staged by 25 neo-Nazis and other people in front of the motel where the refugees were staying. The protest followed weeks of public controversy in which a large number of public officials, members of the press and media, police and the general public spoke and wrote very harsh things about \\"gypsy\\" refugee claimants. Several major newspapers ran news articles and editorials highly critical of gypsy refugees, suggesting a culture of criminality and an abuse by the refugee claimants of Canada's immigration and social services systems. One senior local official was even quoted as saying that gypsies \\"pimp their wives and daughters\\" and train their children to steal. The public mood towards the refugee claimants was especially grim because of ongoing major cuts to social programs, which were already putting local needy families at risk. Three weeks into the controversy, the demonstration occurred, lasting approximately two hours. Protesters held signs that said, for example, \\"Honk if you hate Gypsies\\", \\"Canada is not a Trash Can\\", and \\"G.S.T. ‚Äî Gypsies Suck Taxes\\". (The last is a reference to Canada's unpopular Goods and Services Tax, also known as GST.) The protesters did not refer to \\"Roma\\". Police described the protest as \\"peaceful\\". The trial judge agreed. One of the two lead detectives testified that the \\"essential message\\" of the demonstrators \\"was that \\"gypsy refugee claimants\\" should not be permitted to stay in Canada\\" and that \\"many people were expressing [that] view\\", before and after the demonstration. However, a large number of the protesters wore neo-Nazi paraphernalia. Four months later, after intense public lobbying by pressure groups, the homes of a number of people believed to have been involved in the demonstration were raided by police. Seven people were charged with willful promotion of hatred against an \\"identifiable group\\", a crime under the Criminal Code. All persons charged ranged in age from 15‚Äì20. No public official or members of the media or police were charged. The trial and pre-trial motions lasted 47 days, spread over 16 months, ending in March 2000. The defence called no evidence at trial. Instead, the defence argued that the Crown had failed to prove that the demonstrators specifically targeted \\"Roma\\". They had spoken only of \\"gypsies\\", which may or may not refer to Roma, and the Crown had called no evidence on the point. The Crown responded arguing, among other things, that the defence had already conceded the equivalence of \\"gypsies\\" and \\"Roma\\" and pointed to Exhibit 12, a written defence concession given at the request of the Crown. Attached to Exhibit 12 was an extract of an article authored by one Ian Hancock, which arguably used the words \\"Roma\\" and \\"Gypsies\\" to refer to the same people. The article was selected by the Crown as \\"background\\" to the concession. Exhibit 12 read: \\"On behalf of all accused, [defence counsel] Mr. Gomes and I [defence counsel Lindsay] admit that the Roma people are an identifiable group which were historically persecuted by the Nazis. I agree to admission of the section of the Hancock article entitled 'The Treatment of Roma in Nazi Germany' (pp 7‚Äì8) solely as background to the admission in the previous sentence and not as any further admission. I make no further admission and do not concede to admission of any of the rest of the Hancock article. Mr. Gomes agrees to all of the contents of this fax on behalf of his clients.\\" The trial judge made the following findings of fact with respect to Exhibit 12: \\"The precise and unequivocal concession on the facsimile covering page by both defence counsel is that \\"the roma people are an identifiable group, which were historically persecuted by the Nazis.\\" Solely on the basis of that concession, the defence consented to the admission of the remaining part of the two pages of the exhibit, solely as background to the admission, the previous statement, and nothing more. As a further qualification, the defence writes that there are no further admissions and nothing further is conceded from the rest of the article. A review of the article suggests that the term roma and gypsies may be synonymous. However, whether they are one and the same is not clear. The concession from the defence does not go so far as to concede that they are one and the same, nor that gypsies are an identifiable group, historically persecuted by the Nazis. ... Regardless of what other discussions took place, Exhibit Number 12 is the final result of those discussions, and on its face is clear and unequivocal and would not in my view induce the Crown to believe that it is any more than clearly stated. ... I put directly to Crown counsel in argument the question of which statements on the record made by the defence contributed directly or indirectly to the Crown‚Äôs omission or inadvertence. The Crown was unable to direct me to any particular comments in the transcripts. In my extensive review of the transcripts, I found no such statements.\\" The Crown also pointed to dictionary definitions of \\"gypsy\\" and \\"Roma\\". The defence noted that the dictionary definitions of \\"gypsy\\" included \\"a cunning rogue\\" and that none of the definitions of \\"Roma\\" offered by the Crown referred to the word \\"gypsy\\". The defence won the trial and the Crown appealed. Both the Summary Conviction Appeal Court and later the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the acquittals. The Court of Appeal found that \\"the term gypsy in its broadest sense is often used to refer to people who lead a nomadic life\\" and \\"conjures up unflattering or stereotypical images\\". At the Court of Appeal, the Crown conceded that \\"not all people who are referred to as gypsies are in fact Roma\\". The Crown appealed a third time, to the Supreme Court of Canada. At the Supreme Court of Canada, the Crown conceded that no evidence was tendered at trial showing that the occupants of the motel where the demonstration occurred were in fact \\"Roma\\". Nevertheless, in its judgment several months later, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned the acquittals largely on the basis that, according to witnesses at trial, the motel housed \\"Roma\\". The defence filed a motion for a re-hearing of the appeal. The motion was dismissed, without reasons. Decision The court overturned the dismissal and held, \\"The appeal should be allowed. The acquittals are set aside and new trials ordered.\\" The decision of the Court was written by Justice Louise Charron. She first observed the hate speech law was discussed and held to be constitutional in the case R v Keegstra (1990). In Keegstra, it was found that the definition of the crime was specific enough to be enforceable and its infringement on freedom of expression was minimal. That meant that the Crown was obligated to show the protesters publicly promoted hatred against a racial or religious group. It was not disputed the Roma would be such a group. Moreover, the protesters targeted a specific group. Charron faulted the trial finding as too focussed on the terms \\"Roma\\" and \\"Gypsies,\\" and not on the general question of whether the protesters were attempting to promote hatred of the Roma. Charron emphasized the importance of studying the \\"totality of the evidence\\" and drawing reasonable conclusions to determine whether a group was subject to hate speech.Para. 19. It was suggested that evidence besides the use of the word \\"Gypsies\\" be considered. That included that the Roma were staying at a motel that was targeted, that neo-Nazi displays were used, and that the protesters advocated \\"White Power.\\" Neo- Nazism was particularly important since the Nazi Germans persecuted the Roma in the Holocaust. Finally, Charron noted that use of the words \\"Roma\\" and \\"Gypsies\\" as synonyms need not have been fully proven if it were reasonable enough to believe and not be disputed. The dictionaries used in the case made the use of the synonyms believable and understandable.

The episode was written by George Pelecanos from a story by David Simon & George Pelecanos and was directed by Ernest Dickerson. It originally aired on October 10, 2004. Plot While having dinner with white friends, Carcetti expresses disapproval when they make disparaging comments about African Americans and tells them he intends to run for mayor. He approaches Theresa D'Agostino, a political consultant he knows from law school, and courts her interest in becoming his campaign manager. D'Agostino dismisses his chances since he would be a white candidate running in a majority-black city. Elsewhere, Bunk is unable to find Dozerman's missing gun. He asks McNulty to locate Omar to help with the murders of Tank and Tosha. Later, a drunk McNulty visits Pearlman's house and demands to come inside when he notices Daniels' car out front. Daniels and Pearlman see McNulty through the window. In the Western, Colvin attends a town hall meeting where residents vent their frustrations on rampant crime and the perceived lack of policing. Colvin admits everything they have done has failed; while the residents seem to appreciate his candor, they are enraged that he has put forth no tangible solutions. Later, Colvin looks into working security at Johns Hopkins University following his retirement. When Carver's squad fails to corral the Western's drug crews into Colvin's free zones, Colvin orders school buses to round up the dealers. They are gathered in a school gym and are unwilling to listen to Colvin as he tries to explain how the free zones will operate. Elsewhere, Cutty learns that his landscaping crew is entirely composed of ex-convicts. He approaches Slim Charles, offering himself for anything that pays. McNulty observes a meeting between Bell, developer Andy Krawczyk and State Senator Clay Davis, who discuss plans for revamping Bell's properties as residences in gentrifying areas. Donette tells Bell about McNulty's visit. Avon is granted parole despite Pearlman's protests. Meanwhile, Cutty, Slim Charles, Gerard, and Sapper survey one of their dealers who has been short on his count. Later, Bodie hosts a party where he plies Cutty with drugs and women. At the behest of McNulty and Greggs, Bubbles explores the Barksdale territory in the Western and sees Marlo talking to Fruit, memorizing his license plate number. Back at the detail, Freamon admonishes McNulty and Greggs for showing disloyalty towards Daniels by investigating Bell, despite what the lieutenant has done for them. Freamon and McNulty almost come to blows. Bubbles reports to the detectives about how Marlo has stayed out of the collaboration between the Barksdales and the East Side dealers. Using the license plate number, they pull up Marlo's criminal record. Greggs visits Homicide to talk to Detective Vernon Holley, who describes Marlo as pure evil. She theorizes that Marlo is working for Bell. Greggs spends a day with Bubbles mapping out the territories of the dealers, learning that they are using disposable cell phones. McNulty visits Bell's community college and, using the school's phone records, traces a cell number to Bell. Freamon has Prez check property purchasing records for Bell's front organization. From this information, the detail learns that Bell is trying to build a \\"legitimate\\" business as a property developer, either parallel to or instead of his illicit drug operation. McNulty worries about how they can wiretap Bell's disposable phones. Freamon tells McNulty to swallow his pride and return to the Major Case Unit. Daniels has an awkward drink with McNulty as they discuss Daniels' new relationship with Pearlman. McNulty tells him that he wishes them all the best and Daniels thanks him for making it \\"easy.\\" Production=Title reference Cannabis is legal in the Netherlands (shown in dark blue on this map). The title refers to the Dutch city of Amsterdam, which is famous for its liberal drug laws; Officers Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk and Anthony Colicchio use the city's name as an example to the drug dealers. This subplot was introduced to explore the potential positive effects of de facto \\"legalization\\" of the illegal drug trade, and incidentally prostitution, within the limited boundaries of a few uninhabited city blocks. The posited benefits were reduced street crime citywide and increased outreach of health and social services to at-risk populations. The name \\"Hamsterdam\\" comes from the drug dealers' mishearing Herc when he refers to Amsterdam, although some viewers have noted that the \\"Ham\\" reference may also be a pun based on the dealers' view of the police as \\"pigs.\\" Epigraph Fruit makes this statement in response to Carver and his team trying to move his crew into one of the new drug tolerant zones. This also ties in with Carcetti's announcement of running for mayor in Baltimore, despite his ethnicity, as well as Cutty's difficulty at changing his ways. To a lesser extent, it can apply to McNulty and Rhonda's dysfunctional relationship. Reception Darkroom Productions' \\"Hamsterdam\\" mixtape series, a collection of work from Baltimore rap artists, takes its name from this episode. The second soundtrack compilation Beyond Hamsterdam takes its name from this episode. The term \\"Hamsterdam\\" (or sometimes \\"Hampsterdam\\") has since been used to characterize districts or regions that are ignored by law enforcement agencies. The episode \\"The Foot of Canal Street\\" in the first season of the HBO series Treme contains an inside joke, when Sonny's friends refer to his hometown as \\"Hamsterdam\\" rather than \\"Amsterdam\\".

The darts professional trained their team members at very different venues: Andy trained his team at \\"The Rose\\", a Dartford pub that he runs with his wife, while Bobby trained his at his mansion, George Hall, near Colchester. The four players from Fordham's group competed against each other in a round-robin format and the four players from George's group did the same. The matches consisted of one-leg where the first to reach exactly 501 wins two points. In the event that no player checked out in the time allocated for the match, then the winner was the player who achieved the highest score with 3 darts in a sudden-death shootout.

He is now President of the Breaklife and VII Gems Hip Hop movement in NYC. Ken Swift began B-Boying in 1978 at the age of twelve when he was inspired by dancers on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Widely known in the B-Boy world as \\"the Epitome of a B-Boy,\\" he is universally considered by B-Boys to be the individual who has had the greatest influence on break dancing. Hip Hop Elements article. Retrieved November 10, 2010. Ken Swift is credited with the creation of many dance moves and terminology. His original footwork and \\"freeze style\\" became a foundational part of breaking, which were considered new concepts at the time. Ken Swift has several film credits to his name, including Style Wars, the first Hip Hop documentary, and the first hip-hop major motion picture, Wild Style. His most famous movie was 1983's hit Flashdance, where his two-minute dance with several members of the Rock Steady Crew launched the Hip-Hop scene into international attention. Ken Swift also danced in the motion picture Beat Street. He has since appeared on numerous music videos and documentary films on Hip Hop and breaking. History As a B-Boy, Ken's name originally was \\"Ken Rok\\" and had gone through consistent changes that include \\"Kid Zoom,\\" \\"Ken Ski,\\" \\" and \\"Prince Ken Swift\\" before finally being settled as just \\"Ken Swift\\". He started the Young City Boys in 1978 which included Doze Green, Dante, Deno Rock, Andy, Stevie D, and Disco C among many others. YCB member Ty Fly introduced Ken to Frosty Freeze from Rock City Crew in 1979 and in 1980 they decided together to join the Rock Steady Crew as co-Vice Presidents. The world renowned Rock Steady Crew (RSC) was the first group of Bboys to receive professional recognition from the media and their peers. The Village Voice published the article \\"Breaking is Hard To Do,\\" that included Ken and RSC which influenced a greater audience to garner an interest in Hip Hop and B-Boying. Along with several other members of RSC, Ken Swift performed regularly in local clubs at events such as Negril, Danceteria, the Kitchen, Studio 54 and the Roxy, and he participated in the world's very first International Hip Hop tour \\"New York City Rap\\".

Excavations at Terra Amata found traces of the earliest known domestication of fire in Europe, from 400,000 BC. Middle Palaeolithic Restoration of Mousterian Homo neanderthalensis by Charles R. Knight The Neanderthals are thought to have arrived there around 300,000 BC, but seem to have died out by about by 30,000 BC, presumably unable to compete with modern humans during a period of cold weather. Numerous Neanderthal, or \\"Mousterian\\", artifacts (named after the type site of Le Moustier, a rock shelter in the Dordogne region of France) have been found from this period, some using the \\"Levallois technique\\", a distinctive type of flint knapping developed by hominids during the Lower Palaeolithic but most commonly associated with the Neanderthal industries of the Middle Palaeolithic. Importantly, recent findings suggest that Neandertals and modern humans may have interbred.The date of interbreeding between Neandertals and modern humans Evidence of cannibalism among Neanderthals found in Neanderthal settlements Moula-Guercy and Les Pradelles.The caves that prove Neanderthals were cannibals  Upper Palaeolithic The earliest modern humans ‚Äì Cro-Magnons ‚Äì were present in Europe by 43,000 years ago during a long interglacial period of particularly mild climate, when Europe was relatively warm, and food was plentiful.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/science/fossil-teeth-put-humans- in-europe-earlier-than-thought.html?scp=1&sq;=kents%20cavern&st;=cse When they arrived in Europe, they brought with them sculpture, engraving, painting, body ornamentation, music and the painstaking decoration of utilitarian objects. Some of the oldest works of art in the world, such as the cave paintings at Lascaux in southern France, are datable to shortly after this migration. European Palaeolithic cultures are divided into several chronological subgroups (the names are all based on French type sites, principally in the Dordogne region): *Aurignacian (c. 38,000 - 23,000 BP) ‚Äì responsible for Venus figurines, cave paintings at the Chauvet Cave (continued during the Gravettian period). *P√©rigordian (c. 35,000 - 20,000 BP) ‚Äì use of this term is being debated (the term implies that the following subperiods represent a continuous tradition). **Ch√¢telperronian (c. 39,000 - 29,000 BP) ‚Äì culture derived from the earlier, Neanderthal, Mousterian industry as it made use of Levallois cores and represents the period when Neanderthals and modern humans occupied Europe together. **Gravettian (c. 28,000 - 22,000 BP) ‚Äì responsible for Venus figurines, cave paintings at the Cosquer Cave. *Solutrean (c. 22,000 - 17,000 BP) *Magdalenian (c. 17,000 - 10,000 BP) ‚Äì thought to be responsible for the cave paintings at Pech Merle (in the Lot in Languedoc, dating back to 16,000 BC), Lascaux (located near the village of Montignac, in the Dordogne, dating back to somewhere between 13,000 and 15,000 BC, and perhaps as far back as 25,000 BC), the Trois-Fr√®res cave and the Rouffignac Cave also known as The Cave of the hundred mammoths. It possesses the most extensive cave system of the P√©rigord in France with more than 8 kilometers of underground passageways. Experts sometimes refer to the \\"Franco-Cantabrian region\\" to describe this densely populated region of southern France and northern Spain in the late Palaeolithic.

File:Venus of Brassempouy.jpgFront and side view of the Venus of Brassempouy. The Mesolithic From the Paleolithic to the Mesolithic, the Magdalenian culture evolved. In South-West France and Spain, one finds the Azilian culture of the Late Glacial Maximum which co-existed with similar early Mesolithic European cultures such as the Tjongerian of North-Western, the Ahrensburgian of Northern and the Swiderian of North-Eastern Europe, all succeeding the Federmesser complex. The Azilian culture was followed by the Sauveterrian in Southern France and Switzerland, the Tardenoisian in Northern France, the Maglemosian in Northern Europe. Archeologists are unsure whether Western Europe saw a Mesolithic immigration. If Gravettian or Epipaleolithic immigrants to Europe were indeed Indo-European, then populations speaking non- Indo-European languages are obvious candidates for previous Paleolithic remnants. The Vascons (Basques) of the Pyrenees present the strongest case, since their language is related to none other in the world, and the Basque population has a unique genetic profile. The disappearance of the Doggerland affected the surrounding territories. The Doggerland population had to go as far as northern France and eastern Ireland to escape from the floods. The Neolithic The Neolithic period lasted in northern Europe for approximately 3,000 years (c. 4500 BC-1700 BC). It is characterised by the so-called Neolithic Revolution, a transitional period that included the adoption of agriculture, the development of tools and pottery (Cardium pottery, LBK), and the growth of larger, more complex settlements. There was an expansion of peoples from southwest Asia into Europe; this diffusion across Europe, from the Aegean to Britain, took about 2,500 years (6500 BC‚Äì4000 BC). Some archaeologists believe that this expansion, marking the eclipse of Mesolithic culture, coincided with the introduction of Indo-European speakers, whereas linguists prefer to see Indo-European languages introduced during the succeeding Bronze Age. Within the framework of this latter theory (the Kurgan hypothesis), which remains the most commonly accepted model of Indo-European expansion, Neolithic peoples in Europe are called \\"Pre-Indo-Europeans\\" or \\"Old Europe\\". Many European Neolithic groups share basic characteristics, such as living in small-scale family-based communities, subsisting on domestic plants and animals supplemented with the collection of wild plant foods and with hunting, and producing hand-made pottery (that is made without the potter's wheel). Archeological sites from the Neolithic in France include artifacts from the Linear Pottery culture (c. 5500-4500 BC), the R√∂ssen culture (c. 4500‚Äî4000 BC), and the Chass√©en culture (4,500 - 3,500 BC; named after Chassey-le-Camp in Sa√¥ne-et-Loire), the name given to the late Neolithic pre- Beaker culture that spread throughout the plains and plateaux of France, including the Seine basin and the upper Loire valleys. \\"Armorican\\" (Brittany) and Northern French neolithic culture is based on traditions of the Linear Pottery culture or \\"Limburg pottery\\" in association with the La Hoguette culture. It is most likely from the Neolithic that date the megalithic (large stone) monuments, such as the dolmens, menhirs, stone circles and chamber tombs, found throughout France, the largest selection of which are in the Brittany and Auvergne regions. The most famous of these are the Carnac stones (c. 3300 BC, but may date to as old as 4500 BC) and the stones at Saint- Sulpice-de-Faleyrens.

File:Cairn de Barnenez.JPGCairn of Barnenez is one of the World's oldest monumental grave. The Copper Age During the Chalcolithic or Copper Age, a transitional age from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, France shows evidence of the Seine-Oise-Marne culture and the Beaker culture. The Seine-Oise-Marne culture or \\"SOM culture\\" (c. 3100 to 2400 BC) is the name given by archaeologists to the final culture of the Neolithic in Northern France around the Oise River and Marne River. It is most famous for its gallery grave megalithic tombs which incorporate a port-hole slab separating the entrance from the main burial chamber. In the chalk valley of the Marne River rock-cut tombs were dug to a similar design. Beginning about 2600 BC, the Artenacian culture, a part of the larger European Megalithic Culture, developed in Dordogne, possibly as a reaction to the advance of Danubian peoples (such as SOM) over Western France. Armed with typical arrows, they took over all Atlantic France and Belgium by 2400 BC, establishing a stable border with the Indo-Europeans (Corded Ware) near the Rhine that would remain stable for more than a millennium. In the Southeast, several groups whose culture had evolved from Chass√©en culture also built megaliths. The Beaker culture (c. 2800‚Äì1900 BC) is a wide phenomenon that expanded over most of France, excluding the Massif Central, without significatively altering the pre-existing cultures. The Bronze Age Early Bronze Age daggers from Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur Bronze necklace from Penne, Tarn - Mus√©um de Toulouse. The early Bronze Age archeological cultures in France include the transitional Beaker culture (c. 2800‚Äì1900 BC), the Tumulus culture (c. 1600-1200 BC) and Urnfield culture (c. 1300-800 BC). Bronze Age sites in Brittany are believed to have grown out of Beaker roots, with some Wessex culture and Unetice culture influence. Some scholars think that the Urnfield culture represents an origin for the Celts as a distinct cultural branch of the Indo-European family (see Proto-Celtic). This culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age; the Urnfield period saw a dramatic increase in population in the region, probably due to innovations in technology and agricultural practices. Some archeologists date the arrival of several non-Indo-European peoples to this period, including the Iberians in southern France and Spain, the Ligures on the Mediterranean coast, and the Vascons (Basques) in southwest France and Spain. The Iron Age The spread of iron-working led to the development of the Hallstatt culture (c. 700 to 500 BC) directly from the Urnfield. Proto- Celtic, the latest common ancestor of all known Celtic languages, is generally considered to have been spoken at the time of the late Urnfield or early Hallstatt cultures, in the early 1st millennium BC. The Hallstatt culture was succeeded by the La T√®ne culture, which developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilizations. The La T√®ne culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Farther to the north extended the contemporary Pre-Roman Iron Age culture of Northern Germany and Scandinavia. In subtraction, Greeks and Phoenicians settled outposts like Marseille in this period (c. 600 BC). By the 2nd century BC, Celtic France was called Gaul by the Romans, and its people were called Gauls. The people to the north (in what is present-day Belgium) were called Belgae (scholars believe this may represent a mixture of Celtic and Germanic elements) and the peoples of the south-west of France were called the Aquitani by the Romans, and may have been Celtiberians or Vascons.

Barlett (born July 17, 1936) is an American investigative journalist and author who often collaborates with James B. Steele. According to The Washington Journalism Review, they were a better investigative reporting team than even Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Together they have won two Pulitzer Prizes, two National Magazine Awards and six George Polk Awards. In addition, they have been recognized by their peers with awards from Investigative Reporters and Editors on five separate occasions. They are known for their reporting technique of delving deep into documents and then, after what could be a long investigative period, interviewing the necessary sources. The duo has been working together for over 40 years and is frequently referred to as Barlett and Steele.  Life  Barlett was raised in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. After attending Pennsylvania State University, he served three years as a special agent with the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps until 1956, when he began his journalistic career as a reporter for the Reading (Pennsylvania) Times. Nine years later he became an investigative journalist for The Plain Dealer, and later took similar jobs with The Chicago Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer, where he was to join his collaborator James B. Steele. In 1997, Barlett and Steele became editors-at-large for Time. In 2006, they moved to Vanity Fair as contributing editors. Over the years, Barlett and Steele wrote on such diverse topics as crime, housing, nuclear waste, tax loopholes, the decline of the middle class's standard of living, Howard Hughes, the role of big money in politics, oil prices, immigration, and health care. Barlett and Steele won two Pulitzers and were recognized for their contributions to American journalism for their work while at The Philadelphia Inquirer. In 1972, during one of their earliest collaborations for The Inquirer, Barlett and Steele pioneered the use of computers for the analysis of data on violent crimes. Barlett and Steele won their first Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting and the Gerald Loeb Special Award in 1975 for a series called \\"Auditing the Internal Revenue Service\\" published by The Inquirer. They won their second Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting and the Gerald Loeb Award for Large Newspapers in 1989 at the Inquirer for their coverage of temporary tax breaks embedded in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Their 1991 Inquirer series America: What Went Wrong? was named by the New York University department of journalism as 51st on its list of the 100 best pieces of journalism of the 20th century. Rewritten as a book it became a No. 1 New York Times bestseller. It is one of seven books Barlett and Steele have published, five of which were written while at The Inquirer. After 26 years as a team for The Inquirer, Barlett and Steele left to pursue investigative reporting at Time. It was while they were at Time that the investigative reporting team won their two National Magazine Awards, as well at their record breaking 6th George Polk Award, although this time for excellence in magazine journalism. After leaving Time over monetary issues, Barlett and Steele were hired by Vanity Fair to be contributing editors on the understanding that they would contribute two articles in their signature long-form style each year. In 2007, Barlett and Steele, while still working for Vanity Fair, were featured in the PBS documentary series, Expos√©: America's Investigative Reports, in an episode entitled \\"Friends In High Places,\\" which was about government contracts. When asked on the program how they have managed to work for so many years together, Barlett said, \\"We're both very boring. Who else reads the tax codes?\\" Their lifelong passion for documents have fueled their career and led to important and award-winning journalism. Barlett is married and has a son as well as a stepson.  Impact  Barlett and Steele are used as examples in investigative reporting textbooks as a model of technique and excellence in journalism. As career investigative journalists, Barlett and Steele have become well known for their teamwork, \\"documents state of mind,\\" consistent accuracy, \\"replicability\\" for revealing their sources, and ability to make their work relevant to ordinary people, such as in \\"America: What Went Wrong?\\". Their employers, especially Gene Roberts at The Inquirer, provided them with the opportunity to spend a long period of time reviewing documents in pursuit of journalism with depth and gave them the space to publish their work in lengthy articles in newspapers and magazines. About Barlett and Steele, fellow investigative reporter Bob Woodward said, \\"They're an institution. They have kind of perfected a method of doing their work, and I have the highest regard for it. Systematic, comprehensive - they take a long time, and they don't mind saying what their conclusions are.\\" Both Pulitzer Prize Awards illustrate the auditing function of investigative journalism, whereby the press as \\"The Fourth Estate\\" watches over government. In 1975, they audited the Internal Revenue Service. In 1989, they acted as watchdogs over the House Ways and Means Committee Chair Dan Rostenkowski and the insertion by Democrats and Republicans of temporary tax breaks in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that favored business and saved millions. Barlett and Steele are acknowledged as having affected business investigative journalism throughout their four-decade career, and the Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism established an annual award in their name in 2007.

Steele (born January 3, 1943) is an American investigative journalist and author. With longtime collaborator Donald L. Barlett he has won two Pulitzer Prizes, two National Magazine Awards and five George Polk Awards during their thirty five years of service at The Philadelphia Inquirer, Time, and Vanity Fair. The duo are frequently referred to as Barlett and Steele. Steele was born in Hutchinson, Kansas and was raised in Kansas City, Missouri. He graduated from the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City and began his career at the Kansas City Times, where he covered politics, labor and urban affairs. In 1970 he joined The Philadelphia Inquirer, where he would begin his collaboration with Barlett. In a 1972 collaboration for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Steele and Barlett pioneered the use of computers for the analysis of data on violent crimes. Their story, \\"Auditing the IRS,\\" earned them a Gerald Loeb Special Award in 1975. Twenty years later, they co-authored the series America: What Went Wrong? for The Inquirer, which was named as one of the 100 best pieces of journalism of the 20th century by the New York University School of Journalism. Rewritten into book form, America: What Went Wrong? became a No. 1 New York Times bestseller. It is one of seven books Steele and Barlett have published. In 1989, he and Barlett won the Pulitzer Prize and the Gerald Loeb Award for Large Newspapers for their reporting on the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Barlett and Steele left The Philadelphia Inquirer to become editors-at-large at Time Inc. in 1997. While at Time, they won two National Magazine Awards, the first in 1999 for their three-part series, ‚ÄúWhat Corporate Welfare Costs You,\\" and the second in 2001 for their three-part series in 2000 on campaign finance. In 2006 Barlett and Steele left Time and were hired by Vanity Fair to be contributing editors on the understanding that they would contribute two articles each year. They were available for this new assignment after Time determined that they had insufficient space for the time of long journalistic investigations. In 2007, Barlett and Steele were featured in the PBS documentary series, Expos√©: America's Investigative Reports, in an episode entitled \\"Friends In High Places.\\" In January 2017, it was reported that CNN, as part of \\"a major new initiative in investigative reporting,\\" was hiring Steele along with fellow Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Bernstein as contributing editors, \\"to advise the team on their work and executives on hiring.\\" Steele is married and has a daughter.

History The band was formed initially by former Bored Games members Shayne Carter and Wayne Elsey after the demise of Elsey's other band The Stones in 1983. They employed an old and erratic drum machine (dubbed \\"Herbie Fuckface\\"). Herbie proved too erratic and it was not long before the duo opted to recruit former school friend John Collie to provide a more reliable rhythm section. They took part in the Flying Nun \\"Looney Tour\\" in February 1984, traveling around the country with various other bands, cutting a single, the \\"Double B-side\\" (\\"The Other's Way\\" and \\"Anyone Else Would\\"), in March. Early in 1985, the band recorded an EP, Cut it Out and embarked on a short tour in June. Towards the end of the tour the band were traveling south from Auckland by train, and Elsey, in high spirits, climbed out of a carriage. The train passed under a bridge, killing Elsey instantly. The two remaining members of the band decided not to continue with the name, but later formed the nucleus of Straitjacket Fits.

It is based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Bond girl Pussy Galore and Gert Fr√∂be as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton. The film's plot has Bond investigating gold smuggling by gold magnate Auric Goldfinger and eventually uncovering Goldfinger's plans to contaminate the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. Goldfinger was the first Bond blockbuster, with a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. Principal photography took place from January to July 1964 in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United States. Heralded as the film in the franchise where James Bond \\"comes into focus\\", The release of the film led to a number of promotional licensed tie-in items, including a toy Aston Martin DB5 car from Corgi Toys which became the biggest selling toy of 1964. The promotion also included an image of gold-painted Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson on the cover of Life. Many of the elements introduced in the film appeared in many of the later James Bond films, such as the extensive use of technology and gadgets by Bond, an extensive pre-credits sequence that stood largely alone from the main storyline, multiple foreign locales and tongue-in- cheek humour. Goldfinger was the first Bond film to win an Oscar (for Best Sound Editing) and opened to largely favorable critical reception. The film was a financial success, recouping its budget in two weeks and grossed over $120 million worldwide. In 1999, it was ranked No. 70 on the BFI Top 100 British films list compiled by the British Film Institute. Plot Aerial view of the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository at Fort Knox After destroying a drug laboratory in Latin America, MI6 agent James Bond vacations in Miami Beach. His superior, M, via CIA agent Felix Leiter, directs Bond to observe bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger at the hotel there. Bond discovers Goldfinger cheating at a high-stakes gin rummy game, aided remotely by his employee, Jill Masterson, who prompts him using binoculars and a one-way radio. Bond interrupts Jill and then blackmails Goldfinger into losing. After a night with Jill, Bond is knocked out by Goldfinger's Korean manservant Oddjob. Bond awakens to find Jill dead, covered in gold paint, having died from \\"skin suffocation\\". In London, the governor of the Bank of England and M tell Bond that fluxuating gold prices is allowing someone to profit by selling bullion internationally. Bond's objective is determining how Goldfinger smuggles gold across countries' borders. Q supplies Bond with a modified Aston Martin DB5 and two tracking devices. Bond meets Goldfinger at his country club in Kent and plays a round of golf with him. Goldfinger attempts to cheat, but Bond wins, having bet a recovered Nazi gold bar (provided by MI6). Goldfinger warns Bond against interfering in his affairs, and Oddjob demonstrates his steel- rimmed derby as a deadly weapon. Bond trails Goldfinger to Switzerland. There, Bond meets Jill's sister, Tilly, who attempts and fails to assassinate Goldfinger. Bond sneaks into Goldfinger's refinery and overhears him telling Chinese nuclear physicist, Dr. Ling, that he always travels with his Rolls- Royce Phantom III, hiding some of his gold in secret compartments, and melting the rest to incorporate it into the car's bodywork. Bond also overhears Goldfinger mention \\"Operation Grand Slam\\". Leaving, Bond encounters Tilly, who again tries to kill Goldfinger. An alarm is tripped and Oddjob kills Tilly with his lethal hat. Bond is captured and strapped to a table with an overhead industrial laser, the beam slicing through the surface toward him. Bond lies to Goldfinger, saying that MI6 knows about Operation Grand Slam. Goldfinger spares Bond's life so the MI6 agents surveilling the compound can see him and think 007 is safe. Pilot Pussy Galore flies the captive Bond to Goldfinger's stud farm near Louisville, Kentucky in a private jet. Once there, Bond escapes his cell and witnesses Goldfinger's meeting with American mafiosi, who are supplying materials needed for Operation Grand Slam. Goldfinger plans to breach the U.S. Bullion Depository at Fort Knox by releasing Delta 9 nerve gas into the atmosphere, killing the personnel. Pussy recaptures Bond, and Goldfinger has all the mafiosi executed. Bond tells Goldfinger it would be impossible to move that much gold before American military forces intervened. Goldfinger hints he is not intending to steal it, and Bond deduces that Goldfinger plans to detonate a dirty bomb inside the vault to irradiate the gold, contaminating it with radiation for over half a century. Goldfinger's own gold will then increase in value and the Chinese gain an advantage from the resulting economic chaos. Goldfinger warns that any attempt to locate the bomb or interfere will result in the bomb being detonated at another vital U.S. location. Operation Grand Slam launches with Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spraying gas over Fort Knox, seemingly killing the military guards and government personnel, including Felix Leiter. Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox and accesses the vault as Goldfinger arrives in a helicopter with the bomb. In the vault, Goldfinger's henchman, Kisch, handcuffs Bond to the bomb. Unbeknownst to Goldfinger, Bond seduced Pussy and convinced her to alert the American authorities, after which the gas was replaced with a harmless substance. As the troops attack Goldfinger's men, he locks the vault. He removes his coat to reveal a U.S. Army colonel's uniform and escapes. Bond, Oddjob, and Kisch are trapped inside the vault. Kisch attempts to disarm the bomb, but Oddjob, loyal to Goldfinger, throws him to his death. Bond frees himself, but the physically stronger Oddjob batters him before he can stop the bomb. Bond electrocutes Oddjob to death, then forces open the cabinet containing the bomb but he is unable to disarm the complex mechanism. After killing Goldfinger's men, U.S. troops open the vault. An atomic specialist rushes in, and, with seven seconds left on the countdown clock, simply turns off the device. Bond is being flown to the White House for lunch with the president. En route with Pussy, Goldfinger hijacks the plane. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun fires, shooting out a window, creating an explosive decompression. Goldfinger is blown out through the ruptured window. With the plane out of control, Bond and Pussy parachute safely from the aircraft before it crashes into the ocean. A search helicopter passes overhead the life raft. Bond declares, \\"this is no time to be rescued\\", and draws the parachute over himself and Galore. Cast * Sean Connery as James Bond (007): An MI6 agent who is sent to investigate Auric Goldfinger. Connery reprised the role of Bond for the third time in a row. His salary rose, but a pay dispute later broke out during filming. After he suffered a back injury when filming the scene where Oddjob knocks Bond unconscious in Miami, the dispute was settled: Eon and Connery agreed to a deal where the actor would receive 5% of the gross of each Bond film he starred in. * Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore: Goldfinger's personal pilot and leader of an all-female team of pilots known as Pussy Galore's Flying Circus. Blackman was selected for the role of Pussy Galore because of her role in The Avengers and the script was rewritten to show Blackman's judo abilities. The character's name follows in the tradition of other Bond girls names that are double entendres. Concerned about censors, the producers thought about changing the character's name to \\"Kitty Galore\\", but they and Hamilton decided \\"if you were a ten-year old boy and knew what the name meant, you weren't a ten-year old boy, you were a dirty little bitch. The American censor was concerned, but we got round that by inviting him and his wife out to dinner and [told him] we were big supporters of the Republican Party.\\" During promotion, Blackman took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning the character's name. Whilst the American censors did not interfere with the name in the film, they refused to allow the name \\"Pussy Galore\\" to appear on promotional materials and for the US market she was subsequently called \\"Miss Galore\\" or \\"Goldfinger's personal pilot\\". * Gert Fr√∂be as Auric Goldfinger: A wealthy, psychopathic man obsessed with gold. Orson Welles was considered as Goldfinger, but his financial demands were too high; Theodore Bikel auditioned for the role, but failed. Fr√∂be was cast because the producers saw his performance as a child molester in the German film Es geschah am hellichten Tag. Fr√∂be, who spoke little English, said his lines phonetically, but was too slow. To redub him, he had to double the speed of his performance to get the right tempo. The only time his real voice is heard is during his meeting with members of the Mafia at Auric Stud. Bond is hidden below the model of Fort Knox whilst Fr√∂be's natural voice can be heard above. However, he was redubbed for the rest of the film by stage actor Michael Collins. * Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson: Bond Girl and Goldfinger's aide-de-camp, whom Bond catches helping the villain cheat at a game of cards. He seduces her, but for her betrayal, she is completely painted in gold paint and, according to Bond, dies from \\"skin suffocation\\". Eaton was sent by her agent to meet Harry Saltzman and agreed to take the part if the nudity was done tastefully. It took an hour and a half to apply the paint to her body. Although only a small part in the film, the image of her painted gold was renowned and Eaton appeared on the cover of Life magazine on 6 November 1964. * Tania Mallet as Tilly Masterson: The sister of Jill Masterson, she is on a vendetta to avenge her sister, but is killed by Oddjob. * Harold Sakata as Oddjob: Goldfinger's lethal Korean manservant. Director Guy Hamilton cast Sakata, an Olympic silver medalist weightlifter, as Oddjob after seeing him on a wrestling programme. Hamilton called Sakata an \\"absolutely charming man\\", and found that \\"he had a very unique way of moving, [so] in creating Oddjob I used all of Harold's own characteristics\\". Sakata was badly burned when filming his death scene, in which Oddjob was electrocuted by Bond. Sakata, however, kept holding onto the hat with determination, despite his pain, until the director called \\"Cut!\\" Oddjob has been described as \\"a wordless role, but one of cinema's great villains.\\" * Bernard Lee as M: 007's boss and head of the British Secret Service. * Martin Benson as Mr Solo: The lone gangster who refuses to take part in Operation Grand Slam and is later killed by Oddjob then crushing his dead body in the car in which he is riding. * Cec Linder as Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA liaison in the United States. Linder was the only actor actually on location in Miami. Linder's interpretation of Leiter was that of a somewhat older man than the way the character was played by Jack Lord in Dr. No; in reality, Linder was a year younger than Lord. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the Felix Leiter roleGoldberg, Lee, \\"The Richard Maibaum Interview\\" p. 26, Starlog No. 68, March 1983 in Goldfinger that led the producers to recast the role. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Austin Willis who played cards with Goldfinger. * Austin Willis as Mr Simmons: Goldfinger's gullible gin rummy opponent in Miami. * Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny. * Bill Nagy as Mr Midnight: The gangster whose contributions Goldfinger says helped smuggle the nerve gas across the Canadian border. He initially complains that New York and West Coast mafiosi were also participating, and is the first one to remind Goldfinger that he was specifically promised $1 million. * Michael Mellinger as Kisch: Goldfinger's secondary and quiet henchman and loyal lieutenant who leads his boss's false Army convoy to Fort Knox. * Nadja Regin as Bonita: dancer who sets a trap for Bond in the pre-credit sequence. * Richard Vernon as Colonel Smithers: the Bank of England official. * Burt Kwouk as Mr Ling: A Communist Chinese nuclear fission specialist who provides Goldfinger with the dirty bomb to irradiate the gold inside Fort Knox. * Desmond Llewelyn as Q: The head of Q-Branch, he supplies 007 with a modified Aston Martin DB5. Hamilton told Llewelyn to inject humour into the character, thus beginning the friendly antagonism between Q and Bond that became a hallmark of the series. He had already appeared in the previous Bond film From Russia with Love and, with the exception of Live and Let Die, would continue to play Q in the next 16 Bond films. * Margaret Nolan as Dink: Bond's masseuse from the Miami hotel sequence. Nolan also appeared as the gold-covered body in advertisements for the film and in the opening title sequence as the golden silhouette, described as \\"Gorgeous, iconic, seminal\\". * Gerry Duggan as Hawker: Bond's golf caddy. Production With the court case between Kevin McClory and Fleming surrounding Thunderball still in the High Court, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman turned to Goldfinger as the third Bond film. Goldfinger had what was then considered a large budget of $3 million (US$ million in dollars), the equivalent of the budgets of Dr. No and From Russia with Love combined, and was the first Bond film classified as a box-office blockbuster. Goldfinger was chosen with the American cinema market in mind, as the previous films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe. Terence Young, who directed the previous two films, chose to film The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders instead, after a pay dispute that saw him denied a percentage of the film's profits. Broccoli and Saltzman turned instead to Guy Hamilton to direct. Hamilton, who had turned down directing Dr. No, felt that he needed to make Bond less of a \\"superman\\" by making the villains seem more powerful. Hamilton knew Fleming, as both were involved during intelligence matters in the Royal Navy during World War II. Goldfinger saw the return of two crew members who were not involved with From Russia with Love: stunt coordinator Bob Simmons and production designer Ken Adam. Both played crucial roles in the development of Goldfinger, with Simmons choreographing the fight sequence between Bond and Oddjob in the vault of Fort Knox, which was not just seen as one of the best Bond fights, but also \\"must stand as one of the great cinematic combats\\" whilst Adam's efforts on Goldfinger were \\"luxuriantly baroque\\" and have resulted in the film being called \\"one of his finest pieces of work\\". Writing Richard Maibaum, who co-wrote the previous films, returned to adapt the seventh James Bond novel. Maibaum fixed the novel's heavily criticised plot hole, where Goldfinger actually attempts to empty Fort Knox. In the film, Bond notes it would take twelve days for Goldfinger to steal the gold, before the villain reveals he actually intends to irradiate it with the then topical concept of a Red Chinese atomic bomb. However, Harry Saltzman disliked the first draft, and brought in Paul Dehn to revise it. Hamilton said Dehn \\"brought out the British side of things\\". Connery disliked his draft, so Maibaum returned. Dehn also suggested the pre-credit sequence be an action scene with no relevance to the actual plot. Maibaum, however, based the pre-credit sequence on the opening scene of the novel, where Bond is waiting at Miami Airport contemplating his recent killing of a Latin American drug smuggler. Wolf Mankowitz, an un-credited screenwriter on Dr. No, suggested the scene where Oddjob puts his car into a car crusher to dispose of Mr. Solo's body. Because of the quality of work of Maibaum and Dehn, the script and outline for Goldfinger became the blueprint for future Bond films. Filming Principal photography on Goldfinger commenced on 20 January 1964 in Miami, Florida, at the Fontainebleau Hotel; the crew was small, consisting only of Hamilton, Broccoli, Adam, and cinematographer Ted Moore. Sean Connery never travelled to Florida to film Goldfinger because he was filming Marnie elsewhere in the United States. On the DVD audio commentary, director Guy Hamilton states that other than Cec Linder, who played Felix Leiter, none of the main actors in the Miami sequence were actually there. Connery, Gert Fr√∂be, Shirley Eaton, Margaret Nolan, who played Dink, and Austin Willis, who played Goldfinger's card victim, all filmed their parts on a soundstage at Pinewood Studios when filming moved there. Miami also served as location to the scenes involving Leiter's pursuit of Oddjob. After five days in the US, production moved to England. The primary location was Pinewood Studios, home to, among other sets, a recreation of the Fontainebleau, the South American city of the pre-title sequence and both Goldfinger's estate and factory. Three places near the studio were used: Black Park for the car chase involving Bond's Aston Martin and Goldfinger's henchmen inside the factory complex, RAF Northolt for the American airports and Stoke Park Club for the golf club scene. The end of the chase, when Bond's Aston Martin crashes into a wall because of the mirror, as well as the chase immediately preceding it, were filmed on the road at the rear of Pinewood Studios Sound Stages A and E and the Prop Store. The road is now called Goldfinger Avenue. Southend Airport was used for the scene where Goldfinger flies to Switzerland. Ian Fleming visited the set of Goldfinger in April 1964; he died a few months later in August 1964, shortly before the film's release. The second unit filmed in Kentucky, and these shots were edited into scenes filmed at Pinewood. Principal photography then moved to Switzerland, with the car chase being filmed at the small curved roads near Realp, the exterior of the Pilatus Aircraft factory in Stans serving as Goldfinger's factory, and Tilly Masterson's attempt to snipe Goldfinger being shot in the Furka Pass. Filming wrapped on 11 July at Andermatt, after nineteen weeks of shooting.. \\"Nineteen weeks of principal photography ended with location shooting at Andermatt in Switzerland between 7 and 11 July\\" Just three weeks prior to the film's release, Hamilton and a small team, which included Broccoli's stepson and future producer Michael G. Wilson as assistant director, went for last-minute shoots in Kentucky. Extra people were hired for post-production issues such as dubbing so the film could be finished in time. Broccoli earned permission to film in the Fort Knox area with the help of his friend, Lt. Colonel Charles Russhon. To shoot Pussy Galore's Flying Circus gassing the soldiers, the pilots were only allowed to fly above 3,000 feet. Hamilton recalled this was \\"hopeless\\", so they flew at about 500 feet, and \\"the military went absolutely ape\\". The scenes of people fainting involved the same set of soldiers moving to different locations. For security reasons, filming and photography were not allowed near or inside the United States Bullion Depository. All sets for the interiors of the building were designed and built from scratch at Pinewood Studios. The filmmakers had no clue as to what the interior of the depository looked like, so Ken Adam's imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars. Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian: \\"No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [producer] Cubby Broccoli had some good connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening ‚Äì they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you got out of the car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first.\\" Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built. The comptroller of Fort Knox later sent a letter to Adam and the production team, complimenting them on their imaginative depiction of the vault. United Artists even had irate letters from people wondering \\"how could a British film unit be allowed inside Fort Knox?\\" Adam recalled, \\"In the end I was pleased that I wasn't allowed into Fort Knox, because it allowed me to do whatever I wanted.\\" In fact, the set was deemed so realistic that Pinewood Studios had to post a 24-hour guard to keep the gold bar props from being stolen. Another element which was original was the atomic device, for which Hamilton requested the special effects crew get inventive instead of realistic. Technician Bert Luxford described the end result as looking like an \\"engineering work\\", with a spinning engine, a chronometer and other decorative pieces. Effects alt=A silver-colour car; the plate reads \\"JBZ6007\\". Hamilton remarked, \\"Before [Goldfinger], gadgets were not really a part of Bond's world.\\" Production designer Ken Adam chose the DB5 because it was the latest version of the Aston Martin (in the novel Bond drove a DB Mark III, which he considered England's most sophisticated car). The company was initially reluctant, but was finally convinced to make a product placement deal. In the script, the car was armed only with a smoke screen, but every crew member began suggesting gadgets to install in it: Hamilton conceived the revolving licence plate because he had been getting many parking tickets, while his stepson suggested the ejector seat (which he saw on television). A gadget near the lights that would drop sharp nails was replaced with an oil dispenser because the producers thought the original could be easily copied by viewers. Adam and engineer John Stears overhauled the prototype of the Aston Martin DB5 coupe, installing these and other features into a car over six weeks. The scene where the DB5 crashes was filmed twice, with the second take being used in the film. The first take, in which the car drives through the fake wall, can be seen in the trailer. Two of the gadgets were not installed in the car: the wheel-destroying spikes, inspired by Ben-Hurs scythed chariots, were entirely made in-studio; and the ejector seat used a seat thrown by compressed air, with a dummy sitting atop it. Another car without the gadgets was created, which was eventually furnished for publicity purposes. It was reused for Thunderball. Lasers did not exist in 1959 when the book was written, nor did high-power industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post- production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table to which Bond was strapped. The opening credit sequence was designed by graphic artist Robert Brownjohn, featuring clips of all James Bond films thus far projected on Margaret Nolan's body. Its design was inspired by seeing light projecting on people's bodies as they got up and left a cinema. In 2012, Nolan was interviewed by Playerist Poetry Magazine about her experience as model for the opening credits. alt=A nude woman painted gold lies on a bed. A cushion in the forefront obscures her buttocks. Visually, the film uses many golden motifs, reflecting the novel's treatment of Goldfinger's obsession with the metal. All of Goldfinger's female henchwomen in the film except his private jet's co- pilot (black hair) and stewardess (who is Korean) are red-blonde, or blonde, including Pussy Galore and her Flying Circus crew (both the characters Tilly Masterson and Pussy specifically have black hair in the novel). Goldfinger has a yellow-painted Rolls-Royce with number plate \\"AU 1\\" (\\"Au\\" being the chemical symbol for gold), and also sports yellow or golden items or clothing in every film scene, including a golden pistol, when disguised as a colonel. Jill Masterson is famously killed by being painted with gold, which according to Bond causes her to die of \\"skin suffocation\\". (An entirely fictional cause of death, but the iconic scene caused much of the public to accept it as a medical fact.) Bond is bound to a cutting bench with a sheet of gold on it (as Goldfinger points out to him) before nearly being lasered. Goldfinger's factory henchmen in the film wear yellow sashes, Pussy Galore twice wears a metallic gold vest, and Pussy's pilots all wear yellow sunburst insignia on their uniforms. Goldfinger's Jetstar hostess, Mei-Lei, wears a golden bodice and gold-accented sarong.. \\"Gold seems to persuade every scene, giving it a distinct motif that the other films have lacked\\". The concept of the recurring gold theme running through the film was a design aspect conceived and executed by Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton. The model jet used for wide shots of Goldfinger's Lockheed JetStar was painted differently on the right side to be used as the presidential plane that crashes at the film's end. Several cars were provided by the Ford Motor Company including a Mustang that Tilly Masterson drives, a Ford Country Squire station wagon used to transport Bond from the airport to the stud ranch, a Ford Thunderbird driven by Felix Leiter, and a Lincoln Continental in which Oddjob kills Solo. The Continental had its engine removed before being placed in a car crusher, and the destroyed car had to be partially cut so that the bed of the Ford Falcon Ranchero in which it was deposited could support the weight. Music Since the release date for the film had been pre-determined and filming had finished close to that date, John Barry scored some sequences to rough, non-final versions of the sequences. Barry described his work in Goldfinger as a favourite of his, saying it was \\"the first time I had complete control, writing the score and the song\\". The musical tracks, in keeping with the film's theme of gold and metal, make heavy use of brass, and also metallic chimes. The film's score is described as \\"brassy and raunchy\\" with \\"a sassy sexiness to it\\". Goldfinger began the tradition of Bond theme songs introduced over the opening title sequence, the style of the song from the pop genre and using popular artists. (Although the title song, sung by Matt Monro, in From Russia with Love was introduced in a few phrases on Bond's first appearance, a full rendition on the soundtrack only commenced for the final scene on the waters at Venice and through the following end titles.) Shirley Bassey established the opening title tradition giving her distinguished style to \\"Goldfinger\\", and would sing the theme songs for two future Bond films, Diamonds are Forever and Moonraker. The song Goldfinger was composed by John Barry, with lyrics by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. The track features a young Jimmy Page who was doing many sessions at the time. The lyrics were described in one contemporary newspaper as \\"puerile\\", but what remained undisturbed was the Shirley Bassey interpretation world impact. Like the score, the arrangement makes heavy use of brass, meeting well Miss Bassey's signature belting, and incorporates the Bond theme from Dr. No. Newley recorded the early versions, which were even considered for inclusion in the film. The soundtrack album topped the Billboard 200 chart, and reached 14th place in the UK Albums Chart. The single for \\"Goldfinger\\" was also successful, reaching 8th in the Billboard Hot 100 and 21st in the UK charts. \\"6 Underground\\", a song by the English band Sneaker Pimps from their 1996 studio album Becoming X, uses the harp melody at the beginning of the track \\"Golden Girl\\" from Goldfinger. (\\"Golden Girl\\" plays during a scene when Bond discovers the corpse of Jill Masterson covered in gold paint). Release and reception Goldfinger premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 September 1964, with general release in the United Kingdom the following day. Leicester Square was packed with sightseers and fans and police were unable to control the crowd. A set of glass doors to the cinema was accidentally broken and the premiere was shown ten minutes late because of the confusion. The United States premiere occurred on 21 December 1964, at the DeMille Theatre in New York. The film opened in 64 cinemas across 41 cities and eventually peaked at 485 screens. Goldfinger was temporarily banned in Israel because of Gert Fr√∂be's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fr√∂be for protecting them from persecution during World War II.Associated Press. (6 September 1989). Gert Frobe, an Actor, Dies at 76. Promotion alt=a silver-coloured toy car showing a plastic man being ejected through the roof. The film's marketing campaign began as soon as filming started in Florida, with Eon allowing photographers to enter the set to take pictures of Shirley Eaton painted in gold. Robert Brownjohn, who designed the opening credits, was responsible for the posters for the advertising campaign, which also used actress Margaret Nolan. To promote the film, the two Aston Martin DB5s were showcased at the 1964 New York World's Fair and it was dubbed \\"the most famous car in the world\\"; consequently, sales of the car rose. Corgi Toys began its decades-long relationship with the Bond franchise, producing a toy of the car, which became the biggest selling toy of 1964. The film's success also led to licensed tie-in clothing, dress shoes, action figures, board games, jigsaw puzzles, lunch boxes, toys, record albums, trading cards and slot cars. Critical response Goldfinger was generally a critical success. Derek Prouse of The Sunday Times said of Goldfinger that it was \\"superbly engineered. It is fast, it is most entertainingly preposterous and it is exciting.\\" The reviewer from The Times said \\"All the devices are infinitely sophisticated, and so is the film: the tradition of self-mockery continues, though at times it over-reaches itself\\", also saying that \\"It is the mixture as before, only more so: it is superb hokum.\\" Connery's acting efforts were overlooked by this reviewer, who did say: \\"There is some excellent bit-part playing by Mr. Bernard Lee and Mr. Harold Sakata: Mr. Gert Fr√∂be is astonishingly well cast in the difficult part of Goldfinger.\\" Donald Zec, writing for the Daily Mirror, said of the film that \\"Ken Adam's set designs are brilliant; the direction of Guy Hamilton tautly exciting; Connery is better than ever, and the titles superimposed on the gleaming body of the girl in gold are inspired.\\" Penelope Gilliatt, writing in The Observer, said that the film had \\"a spoofing callousness\\" and that it was \\"absurd, funny and vile\\". The Guardian said that Goldfinger was \\"two hours of unmissable fantasy\\", also saying that the film was \\"the most exciting, the most extravagant of the Bond films: garbage from the gods\\", adding that Connery was \\"better than ever as Bond\\". Alan Dent, writing for The Illustrated London News, thought Goldfinger \\"even tenser, louder, wittier, more ingenious and more impossible than From Russia with Love... [a] brilliant farrago\\", adding that Connery \\"is ineffable\\". Philip Oakes of The Sunday Telegraph said that the film was \\"dazzling in its technical ingenuity\\", while Time said that \\"this picture is a thriller exuberantly travestied.\\" Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times was less enthusiastic about the film, saying that it was \\"tediously apparent\\" that Bond was becoming increasingly reliant on gadgets with less emphasis on \\"the lush temptations of voluptuous females\\", although he did admit that \\"Connery plays the hero with an insultingly cool, commanding air.\\" He saved his praises for other actors in the film, saying that \\"Gert Fr√∂be is aptly fat and feral as the villainous financier, and Honor Blackman is forbiddingly frigid and flashy as the latter's aeronautical accomplice.\\" In Guide for the Film Fanatic, Danny Peary wrote that Goldfinger is \\"the best of the James Bond films starring Sean Connery ... There's lots of humor, gimmicks, excitement, an amusing yet tense golf contest between Bond and Goldfinger, thrilling fights to the death between Bond and Oddjob and Bond and Goldfinger, and a fascinating central crime ... Most enjoyable, but too bad Eaton's part isn't longer and that Fr√∂be's Goldfinger, a heavy but nimble intellectual in the Sydney Greenstreet tradition, never appeared in another Bond film.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times declared this to be his favourite Bond film and later added it to his \\"Great Movies\\" list. The film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a \\"Certified Fresh\\" score of 99% and an average score of 8.6/10 based on 67 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"Goldfinger is where James Bond as we know him comes into focus ‚Äì it features one of 007's most famous lines ('A martini. Shaken, not stirred') and a wide range of gadgets that would become the series' trademark\\". Goldfinger is the highest-rated James Bond film on Rotten Tomatoes. Box office Goldfingers $3 million budget was recouped in two weeks, and it broke box office records in multiple countries around the world. The Guinness Book of World Records went on to list Goldfinger as the fastest grossing film of all time. Demand for the film was so high that the DeMille cinema in New York City had to stay open twenty-four hours a day.. \\"On Christmas Eve, the DeMille officially opened for 24 hours straight and did not close again until after New Year's Day\\" The film closed its original box office run having grossed $23 million in the United States and $46 million worldwide.. \\"Produced at a budget of $3 million, Goldfinger grossed a phenomenal $46 million worldwide the first time around.\\" After reissues, the first being as a double feature with Dr. No in 1966, Goldfinger grossed a total of $51,081,062 in the United States and $73,800,000 elsewhere, for a total worldwide gross of $124,900,000. The film distributor Park Circus re- released Goldfinger in the UK on 27 July 2007 at 150 multiplex cinemas, on digital prints. The re-release put the film twelfth at the weekly box office. Awards and nominations At the 1965 Academy Awards, Norman Wanstall won the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing for his work, making Goldfinger the first Bond film to receive an Academy Award. John Barry was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Score for a Motion Picture, and Ken Adam was nominated for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for Best British Art Direction (Colour), where he also won the award for Best British Art Direction (Black and White) for Dr. Strangelove. The American Film Institute has honoured the film four times: ranking it No. 90 for best movie quote (\\"A martini. Shaken, not stirred\\"), No. 53 for best song (\\"Goldfinger\\"), No. 49 for best villain (Auric Goldfinger), and No. 71 for most thrilling film. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly and IGN both named Goldfinger as the best Bond film, while MSN named it as the second best, behind its predecessor. IGN and EW also named Pussy Galore as the second best Bond girl. In 2008, Total Film named Goldfinger as the best film in the series. The Times placed Goldfinger and Oddjob second and third on their list of the best Bond villains in 2008. They also named the Aston Martin DB5 as the best car in the films. Home media The film was released in 1994 in the US and Europe on Video CD. It was first released on DVD in the US in 1997 by MGM Home Entertainment and in Europe in 2000. 2006 saw the release of the 'Ultimate Edition' DVD, whose video was sourced from a newly-scanned 4K master of the orignal film. In 2008, Goldfinger was made available on Blu-ray Disc. Impact and legacy Goldfingers script became a template for subsequent Bond films. It was the first of the series showing Bond relying heavily on technology, as well as the first to show a pre-credits sequence with only a tangential link to the main story‚Äîin this case allowing Bond to get to Miami after a mission. Also introduced for the first of many appearances is the briefing in Q-branch, allowing the viewer to see the gadgets in development. The subsequent films in the Bond series follow most of Goldfingers basic structure, featuring a henchman with a particular characteristic, a Bond girl who is killed by the villain, big emphasis on the gadgets and a more tongue-in-cheek approach, though trying to balance action and comedy. Goldfinger has been described as perhaps \\"the most highly and consistently praised Bond picture of them all\\" and after Goldfinger, Bond \\"became a true phenomenon.\\" The success of the film led to the emergence of many other works in the espionage genre and parodies of James Bond, such as The Beatles film Help! in 1965 and a spoof of Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1967. Indeed, it has been said that Goldfinger was the cause of the boom in espionage films in the 1960s, so much so that in \\"1966, moviegoers were offered no less than 22 examples of secret agent entertainment, including several blatant attempts to begin competing series, with James Coburn starring as Derek Flint in the film Our Man Flint and Dean Martin as Matt Helm\\". Even within the Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, includes an homage to the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath, and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an ejector seat in a car and using a tuxedo under a drysuit. The success of the film led to Ian Fleming's Bond novels receiving an increase of popularity and nearly 6 million books were sold in the United Kingdom in 1964, including 964,000 copies of Goldfinger alone. Between the years 1962 to 1967 a total of 22,792,000 Bond novels were sold. The 2012 video game 007 Legends features a level based on Goldfinger.

Bell had several accomplishment throughout his career, including winning Super Bowl XLIV as a member of the Saints. Early years Bell went to Desert Horizon before playing for Tolleson Union High School a western suburb of Phoenix, where he both became the second player in Arizona history to have rushed for over 2,000 yards in back to back seasons, as well as obtaining the second-highest career total of 4,692 yards rushing in Arizona.

Bell had a very strong training camp, and before the Broncos first preseason game, Bell was promoted to the starting tailback position. This promotion shocked many, as it was presumed that either Tatum Bell or Ron Dayne would win the Broncos' starting job. However Tatum Bell ended up as the starter for the first regular season game, with Mike Bell also getting carries in a backup role. During week 8 of the 2006 season, in which the Broncos played the undefeated Indianapolis Colts, Tatum Bell was taken out with a turf toe.

It was formed on 1 January 2006 from the municipalities of Willisau Land (W. Country) and Willisau Stadt (W. Town).Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 19 July 2011 History=Foundation There were Roman settlements near Willisau by the 2nd or 3rd century AD. In 893 the Alamannic settlement of Cozeriswilare / Gesserswil was mentioned near modern Willisau. By the 11th century a parish church existed in the area and in 1101 the lords of Honstetten (Hegau) were mentioned as holding the patronage rights over the church at Willineshouwo. In 1245 the Freiherr von Hasenburg held the church and the surrounding lands as a fief for the Habsburgs. In 1302-3 the three Hasenburg brothers, Markward, Heimo and Walter, founded the fortified town of Willisau. The new town was granted the right have a wall and fortifications by the Habsburgs and later the right to hold markets. At the time of its founding it probably had about 150 citizens. Through marriage, in 1367, the Counts of Aarburg inherited the town. However, it still remained a fief under the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1375 Duke Leopold of Austria ordered the poorly fortified city to be burned to prevent its capture by the Guglers, English and French mercenaries who were raiding throughout the region. Just over ten years later, during the Sempach War of 1386, Leopold ordered the town burned again to prevent it falling into Swiss hands. The small villages surrounding Willisau were founded during the Middle Ages and were ruled by a number of different nobles over the centuries. Survival Wall painting commemorating two leaders of alt=Painting of two bearded men in 17th-century dress In 1407 the descendants of the Hasenburg family sold the town to Lucerne. Because the town sat on an important trade route from Lucerne to Bern, it grew into an important regional trade center and center of a district or vogtei. However, initially the vogt remained in Lucerne and ruled through local amtmann or bailiff. In 1471 a fire destroyed much of the town. Over the following centuries, the town gradually gained additional rights and autonomy. After the Swiss peasant war of 1653 the vogt moved from Lucerne to Willisau to better control the countryside, while giving the town increased autonomy. In 1690-95 a large Bailiff's Castle was built by Landvogt Franz Bernhard Feer as a residence and administrative center of the vogt. By the 16th century the town had become the home of many small craftsmen and business owners. While the town remained somewhat prosperous, there were very few wealthy citizens. In 1704 the town was destroyed for a fourth time by a fire. Very few of the residents were wealthy enough to rebuilt their homes and reconstruction was very slow. Division and reunification Before 2006, the municipality was divided into Willisau Stadt (the city, ) and Willisau Land (countryside, ). During the 17th and 18th centuries the town was relatively well off, while Willisau Land was generally poorer. In 1763 a special tax was decreed on the town to help support the poor of the surrounding countryside. Those in Willisau Land were placed under the laws and jurisdiction of the town, but were no longer responsible to care for the poor. In 1798, following the creation of the Helvetic Republic, the special rights of the town's citizens were abolished and the two tax districts became separate municipalities. Following the collapse of the Republic and the 1803 Act of Mediation, the two municipalities became totally autonomous. Despite being two separate communities, Willisau Stadt remained the population and economic center of the area. By the 1990s the two municipalities shared a number of organizations and responsibilities. On 25 January 2004, the population of both municipalities voted for reunification. So, on 1 January 2006 the formerly separate municipalities of Willisau Stadt and Willisau Land merged into the municipality of Willisau.Canton of Lucerne, Office of Municipalities accessed 18 August 2009 Geography Willisau and surrounding hills Aerial view (1949) Willisau has an area, (as of the 2004/09 survey) of .

The entire town of Willisau is part of the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites. Parish church The village of Willisau was founded near the first parish church. That first building was replaced with a Romanesque in the 13th century, of which only the tower remains. In 1805-10 the current church, with extensive classicist columns, was built on the site of the earlier churches. It was designed by Josef Purtschert. In 1929 it was renovated. During the renovation, a large reinforced concrete bell tower was added to the church roof. This tower is considered an architectural achievement in reinforced concrete construction. In 1995-7 the church was renovated and the interior was returned to its original appearance. Holy Blood Church (Heiligblut) The current chapel was built in 1674 on the site of an earlier Gothic chapel and an even earlier wooden chapel. According to legend, on 7 July 1392 three men were playing cards near the chapel site. When one of the men lost all his money, he drew his sword and cursed Christ. Five drops of blood fell on the table and the blasphemer, Ueli Schr√∂ter, was dragged away by the Devil. The second man died as he tried to clean up the five drops of blood and the third fled and died outside the town gates. The table with five drops of holy blood was saved by a local priest and the wooden chapel was built to hold it. The current chapel was built in the Renaissance style with a large Tuscan porch. Three wooden early Baroque altars were added a few years later. The walls are decorated with eight paintings of the legend of the Holy Blood. The ceiling was decorated with 70 paintings by Anton Amberg, showing biblical scenes, the apostles and patrons of the chapel.

It incorporates the long pastern bone (proximal phalanx) and the short pastern bone (middle phalanx), which are held together by two sets of paired ligaments to form the pastern joint (proximal interphalangeal joint). Anatomically homologous to the two largest bones found in the human finger, the pastern was famously mis-defined by Samuel Johnson in his dictionary as \\"the knee of a horse\\". When a lady asked Johnson how this had happened, he gave the much-quoted reply: \\"Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance.\\"James Boswell, The Life of Samuel Johnson LL.D., Chapter 14 Anatomy and importance The pastern consists of two bones, the uppermost called the \\"large pastern bone\\" or proximal phalanx, which begins just under the fetlock joint, and the lower called the \\"small pastern bone\\" or middle phalanx, located between the large pastern bone and the coffin bone, outwardly located at approximately the coronary band. The joint between these two phalangeal bones is aptly called the \\"pastern joint\\". This joint has limited movement, but does help to disperse the concussive forces of the horse's step and also has some influence on the flexion or extension of the entire leg. The pastern is vital in shock absorption. When the horse's front leg is grounded, the elbow and knee are locked. Therefore, the fetlock and pastern are responsible for all the absorption of concussive forces of a footfall. Together, they effectively distribute it among both the bones of the leg and the tendons and ligaments. Matching angles The slope of the shoulder is often the same as the slope of the pastern. The angle of the pastern should also match the angle of the hoof after the latter has been trimmed (the angle will change as the hoof grows and may be off in a few weeks). This keeps the bones of the pastern and coffin joints in proper alignment, with a straight line running through their core. An angle broken forward or back increases the stress on these bones, joints, tendons, and ligaments. If the angle does not match, it could be an indication of poor farrier work, but some horses may have underlying conformational defects that can not be modified through farriery alone. Conformation The pastern joint is evaluated when a horse is studied conformationally, as it will affect the gait of the horse and the soundness of the joints above it. Traditionally, the ideal pastern joint of the front leg was a 45-degree angle. However, this angle has been revised to a slightly steeper angle of 47-55 degrees, as the traditional angle, although it makes for comfortable riding, greatly increases the chance of breakdown. Because there is less need for shock absorption in the hindleg, its pasterns are somewhat more upright than those of the front leg, to increase its strength (about 49-59 degrees). If the hind pasterns are the same angle as the front, or too sloping in general, then they are likely to break down during the horse's career, especially if the horse in employed in strenuous work. The length of the pastern joint is determined by the length of the first phalanx. The short pastern bone is less a determinant because it is smaller, at 2 inches in length, and part of it is encased in the hoof. Long, sloping pasterns Long, sloping pasterns are commonly seen in Thoroughbreds and Saddlebreds. A nicely sloped pastern increases the likelihood of a long career. It improves the animal's ability to travel on uneven terrain, helps it withstand the rigors of a competition or race, and makes the gait more comfortable for the rider. They are desired in a riding horse because they increase the shock-absorption ability of the leg, making the horse's gait smoother and more comfortable for the rider. However, this flexibility also increases the risk of certain connective tissue injuries that are not seen in horses with more upright pasterns. This is because many of the tendons and ligaments that go down the back of the leg continue under the back of the fetlock joint, and attach to either the pastern bones or the coffin bone. When the horse puts weight on his leg, the fetlock sinks closer to the ground, which is a needed response as it helps to absorb the shock of the footfall. However, when the pasterns are too long or sloping it does not support the fetlock enough, and the fetlock may hyper-extend, possibly to the point where the ergot touches the ground. This stresses the soft tissues that run under the fetlock because they are stretched longer. If stretched too much, they may tear or rupture. Medical problems that are more common in horses with long, sloping pasterns include: * Bowed tendon * Sesamoiditis * A fracture of the sesamoid bones found at the back of the fetlock, should the joint hyperextend to the point where it touches the ground. This is especially likely if the horse is tired, such as at the end of a race. * Injury to the suspensory ligament * Ringbone, due to excessive stress on the pastern joint Short, upright pasterns Draft horse with upright (65-degree) pasterns Short, upright pasterns are beneficial in that they decrease the chance that the horse will suffer from soft-tissue injury. However, upright pasterns increase concussion by transmitting more of the shock of footfalls to the bones rather than the tendons. This not only makes the gaits uncomfortable due to the jarring, but also increases the chance of arthritis and may shorten the animal's career. A short, upright pastern also decreases the stride length of the gait, which again makes the gait more uncomfortable and decreases the efficiency of the horse's movement (since he must take more strides per meter than a longer-strided horse). Medical problems linked to short, upright pasterns are usually a result of excess concussion. They include: * Ringbone * Sidebone * Splints * Bucked shins * Knee injuries that result from concussion, including bucked knees * Navicular disease * Windpuffs Short, upright pasterns are often seen in draft horses. This is because draft horses bred for pulling rather than riding (and so they were not selected for smooth gaits of a saddle horse), and because upright pasterns give more leverage to dig into the ground as the horse pulls a heavy load. Short, upright pasterns are also commonly seen in Quarter Horses, Warmbloods, and Paint Horses. However, riding horses are more likely to have problems with upright pasterns than draft horses because they tend to work at faster speeds. Due to the lack of shock absorption, horses that have upright pasterns should be kept off hard surfaces whenever possible.

Andrew Lang included it in The Crimson Fairy Book.Andrew Lang, The Crimson Fairy Book, \\"How to find out a True Friend\\" Synopsis A childless king and queen pledged to St. James that if they had a son, he would make a pilgrimage on his eighteenth birthday. They had a son. When he was twelve, his father died. When his eighteenth birthday grew near, the queen grieved over the thought of not seeing him for a year; she tried to put her son off, but when his consolations for her pretended causes did not work, she had to reveal the truth. He assured her that he would return. The queen gave him apples and told him that he needed a companion, but he should invite any prospect to eat with him, and then he should cut an apple into two unequal parts and reject anyone who did not take the smaller. He met three young men, each of whom also claimed to be going on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James, but the first two wanted the larger part, and the prince feigned illness to be rid of them. The third took the smaller, and they traveled together, having pledged that if one died, the other would bring his body. It took them a year to reach the shrine. At one point, they hired a house to rest before they continued. The king saw them, thought them both handsome but the prince the handsomer, and resolved to marry his daughter to the prince. He invited them both to dinner, and poisoned the friend, thinking that would keep the prince from travelling on. Instead, the prince instantly resolved to go on. The king offered his daughter, but the prince went on, and brought his friend's body with him. The friend was not dead, only sleeping, and when the prince had reached the shrine, he prayed the friend be restored to life, and he was. They returned to the king, and the prince married his daughter. The prince, after a time, declared that he had to return home. The king hated the friend and sent him off with a message, telling him the prince would wait; then he got the prince to leave, assuring him the friend could catch him, he would give him a good horse. When the friend returned, the king sent him after the prince on foot. He was exhausted when he reached the prince, so the prince tended to him like a brother and brought him home. However, no doctor was able to cure him. The prince's wife gave birth to a daughter. One day, a strange old man arrived, and the queen brought him to the friend. He declared that the man could be restored by the daughter's blood. The prince was horror-struck, but since he had declared he would treat his friend as his brother, he did it. The friend was restored, but the daughter lay in her cradle as if dead. The old man returned, revealed he was St. James of Lizia, and restored the girl.

The show stars Greg Giraldo as a Latino lawyer at a mostly white law firm. The series was created by Rob LaZebnik, and produced by Witt/Thomas Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. Due to low ratings, the series was pulled from ABC's schedule after four episodes had aired. Synopsis Common Law focuses on John Alvarez (Greg Giraldo), the seemingly- token Latino at a large, WASPy law firm. John has a degree from Harvard Law School, but never forgets his working-class Queens roots, nor the idea that law is about protecting the \\"little guy\\" from the major corporations that are his firms' key clients. He has started a clandestine affair with fellow attorney Nancy Slaton (Megyn Price), clandestine because the firm forbids lawyers from dating each other to minimize claims of sexual harassment. To the disgust of his barber father, Luis (Gregory Sierra), John wears his hair long and plays guitar; his father views him as a hippie. Greg Giraldo was in reality a graduate of Harvard Law School nearly top of his class, and became a lawyer for a while before becoming a comedian. After a year as an attorney, Giraldo fell out of love with the profession and launched his comedy career, only referring to his law background very occasionally on the stand-up circuit, until he starred in this series. Supporters of Common Law pointed to the Saturday 9:30/8:30 time slot as a factor in its poor ratings and subsequent cancellation despite having the long-running ABC sitcom Coach as its lead-in. The series garnered much praise from the Latino community, who were happy to see a character and entertainer of Latino descent starring in such an upscale role. Subsequently, they gave ABC much backlash when the show was canceled.

History The Capen house was built on a lot in 1694 as the parsonage for the local Congregational Church. It is located at what is now 1 Howlett Street, next to the Topsfield Common. It was first owned by the Reverend Joseph Capen, who had moved to Topsfield from Dorchester. His wife had seen the previous parsonage and was disappointed by its condition. The family lived there for over forty years. At the time that it was built, it was considered to be the best house in the town. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.Patricia Heintzelman and Charles Snell (1975) , National Park Service and It is one of the best preserved homes from its period in New England. The Topsfield Historical Society currently operates it as a historic house museum. Architecture The Capen house was built with English style architecture, and it bears a strong resemblance to many houses in England. The house features overhangs called jetties at the front and sides, but not the rear, of the building. Although many have assumed that the overhangs were intended as protection from Native Americans, they were primarily decorative and also served to shield people from rain. The house has a small entrance hallway leading to the staircase. It contains four rooms, each of which contains a fireplace. It has exposed low ceilings with wooden beams. The house has a pilastered chimney, which was unusual at the time the house was built. That type of chimney was primarily used in English Manor style houses. The house also has casement windows, each of which has 30 panes. These windows were seen as a luxury when the house was built. Hanging wood pendills, ornaments that were carved by the carpenter who built the house, were also used as decoration.

The company was founded by Wilbur Ross and was sold to Platinum Equity in 2016. Current operations ITG's operating companies include: * Cone Denim * Burlington WorldWide Apparel * Burlington House Interior Fabrics * Carlisle Finishing * Automotive Safety Textiles Locations ITG continues to manufacture fabrics in North America, but it has also developed fabric mills in China, Vietnam and Central America. Its best-known fabrics are denim and specialty nylon fabrics used in automotive airbag systems. Denim fabrics are made in the United States, in Greensboro, NC, in Mexico and are also now being made in China and Nicaragua in new company plants. In the summer of 2009, ITG reported that it had closed the Nicaragua mill- which it had just opened- because its main customer moved its cut and sew operation out of Nicaragua. This makes the venture to build the plant almost a total loss to ITG. Many ready-to-wear brands purchase fabrics from Cone Denim, including Levi's, Wrangler and American Eagle Outfitters. The company is also known for its worsted wool fabrics, which are made in North Carolina and in Mexico. The company has developed a source for wool fabrics in India by working with OCM India Limited, a mill in Amritsar, India, which is also owned by funds controlled by W.L. Ross & Co. Customers of the wool fabrics include many well-known makers of wool garments (such as Jos A. Bank and others). The company also produces some technical fabrics, such as fabrics made of polyester and nylon. These fabrics have a variety of uses, such as in uniforms, in performance apparel items and for safety services. Brands The ITG Automotive Group manufactures fabrics and cushion for airbags, which are sold to automotive safety groups, such as Autoliv, TRW and Delphi. Many automobiles throughout the world contain ITG's safety fabrics. The fabrics and cushion are manufactured in various locations (U.S., Germany, Poland, China, Mexico). The company owns the brand BURLINGTON, which is licensed to a company in Germany for a European menswear brand. History The company was founded by Wilbur Ross. WL Ross & Co acquired the assets of the former Burlington Industries out of bankruptcy in late 2003, and the assets of the former Cone Mills Corporation in 2004. In 2006, ITG merged with Safety Components International, Inc., a Greenville, South Carolina company that manufactures nylon fabrics that are used in automotive airbags, that was also controlled by Wilbur Ross. In January 2007, ITG announced that it was selling it mattress fabric product line to Culp, Inc., another U.S. textile company that is based in High Point, NC. Also during 2007, the Company has opened a mill in China that will develop apparel and interior fabrics and the Company is developing a Vietnam venture that will supply apparel fabrics and garments. On April 1, 2007, BST Safety Textiles came into the ITG family of business. By adding BST Safety Textiles ITG's business in automotive components has now grown significantly. However, in the summer of 2009, ITG's air bag unit filed bankruptcy and was taken over by secured creditors. In December 2006, Wilbur Ross completed the purchase of BST Safety Textiles GmbH (BST), previously known as Berger Safety Textiles, of Maulburg, Germany. BST is a producer of flat fabric used in manufacturing automobile airbags, one piece woven (known as OPW) airbags, and narrow fabric used in automobile seatbelts and all types of industrial strapping applications. BST currently operates locations in southern Germany, Poland, and the US in Virginia. BST employs over 1200 persons worldwide. Recently, the company sold certain trademark rights to the BURLINGTON brand in Europe to FALKE, a European high-fashion brand. The company was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.

It is best known for developing science-based seafood recommendations that consumers, chefs, and business professionals use to inform their seafood purchasing decisions. Seafood Watch is a program of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It has roots in the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Fishing for Solutions exhibit, which ran from 1997 to 1999 and produced a list of sustainable seafood. It was one of the first resources for sustainable seafood information together with the Audubon Society's What is a fish lover to eat? which also came out in the late 1990s. Seafood Watch assesses impacts on marine and freshwater ecosystems of fisheries (wild-caught) and aquaculture (farming) operations. The assessments and calculations result in an overall scoring and final rating known as a Seafood Watch Recommendation. There is currently a seafood watch app for the iPhone and Android. One of its features allows people to find restaurants and stores near them that serve ocean-friendly seafood. Sustainable seafood list The organization's recommendations focus on the North American market, suggesting what seafood is a green \\"Best Choice,\\" yellow \\"Good Alternative,\\" or a red \\"Avoid.\\" The \\"Avoid\\" category is for seafood which is overfished or fished or farmed in ways that harm other marine life or the environment. Health alerts for fish with high levels of contaminants (e.g. mercury, dioxins, PCBs) are also noted, although they may appear in any category. The Seafood Watch website includes regional, country-wide, and sushi guides for the United States. Pocket guides are available from the aquarium and further information is on the web site. Several of the regional guides are also available in Spanish. The guides are updated twice annually, while the website is updated more often. Restaurants and retailers are also targeted with an educational program developed by Seafood Watch. In 2010 Seafood Watch added its ‚ÄúSuper Green‚Äù list, which features seafood that it is good for human health and does not harm the oceans. The Super Green list highlights products that are currently on the Seafood Watch \\"Best Choices\\" (green) list, are low in environmental contaminants, and are good sources of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. Seafood Watch partners with zoos, aquariums, science museums, nature centers, and other non-profits to promote sustainable seafood. Its business and culinary initiatives assist seafood buyers, distributors, retailers, food service professionals, and chefs in moving the marketplace towards environmentally responsible fisheries and aquaculture operations. The Monterey Bay Aquarium's Ocean Conservation Policy team works to advance policies and management measures to improve traceability in the global seafood supply chain; eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; strengthen and advocate for fisheries management; and restore shark and Bluefin tuna populations. Industry criticism Industry organizations have pushed back against Seafood Watch's efforts. After publication of a sustainable sushi guide, the National Fisheries Institute, a seafood industry trade group, wrote on its blog that the guides were \\"confusing and contradictory,\\" adding that they didn't fully take into account the economic, environmental and social aspects of seafood sustainability.

The Addington Railway Workshops was a major railway facility established in the Christchurch suburb of Addington in May 1880 by the New Zealand Railways Department. The workshops closed in 1990. Description Addington Railway Workshops were opened in 1877-8 to overhaul and construct railway equipment, and to assemble locomotives being imported from England. In 1889, the workshops were responsible for building the first locomotive to be built by NZR, W 192 and continued to build locomotives up to the early 1920s. As well as railway work, Addington also undertook contract work such as the manufacture of gold dredge components; during the First World War, the workshops produced military equipment including aeroplane components. During the 1920s, Addington was re-geared to manufacture and overhaul rolling stock, although it continued to carry out limited overhauls on steam locomotives and the EC and EO class electric locomotives. Limited locomotive construction resumed in 1962 with the construction of the DSC class centre-cab shunting locomotives. Addington also assembled the Mitsubishi DSA and DSB class diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives in 1967-8 and four of the five Toshiba DSJ class centre-cab shunters in 1984. Due to the rationalisation of the New Zealand Railways Corporation following deregulation in 1987, Addington Workshops closed on 14 December 1990. The site was cleared with the exception of the former water down; due to changes in freight handling the Main North Line was realigned across the former works entrance, while a new Christchurch Railway Station was opened on this site along the realigned stretch of track on 5 April 1993, replacing the former Christchurch railway station on Moorhouse Avenue in central Christchurch. The remainder of the site was sold to NgƒÅi Tahu for redevelopment as a shopping centre, named Tower Junction after the former workshops water tower. The Addington Water Tower is registered with Heritage New Zealand as a Category I heritage building, registration number 5390. Locomotive building Addington Workshops built NZR's first locomotive, W 192. Locomotive building ceased in the 1960s with the DSC class, although four DSJ class locomotives were assembled from imported kitsets in the early 1980s.

There are several styles that can be recognized as an influence: classical composers like Ravel and Debussy; the big bands of the 1940s; and different exotic styles, such as samba, Latin, and calypso jazz. Space Age pop is related to the genres of lounge music, exotica, or beautiful music/easy listening,\\"the 1950s and 1960s - an era obsessed with technological advancements and new frontiers. The covers depict happy families, comfortable homes, and cocktail parties. Space Age Pop is the musical interpretation of these dreams.

Space age pop records often have space related covers, such as rockets, moonscapes, or extra terrestrial-looking graphics. Genre and style Space age pop brought innovation to popular music in several ways. Its LPs in the early 1950s included some of the earliest examples of concept albums,\\"The Beatles 1967 Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is often cited as the first concept album. But Space Age Pop artists were recording them as soon as the LP came out in the late 1940s.\\", Page 10, Exotiquarium: Album Art from the Space Age, Jennifer McKnight-Trontz and Lenny Dee, St. Martin's Press Music/Songbooks, 1999, and embraced the earliest form of four-track recordings introduced in 1957.\\"Between 1957 and the introduction of quadraphonic (four-channel) recordings in the 1970s, Space Age Pop artists made stereo an essential factor in choosing instruments and composing their music.\\", Page 10, Exotiquarium: Album Art from the Space Age, Jennifer McKnight-Trontz and Lenny Dee, St. Martin's Press Music/Songbooks, 1999, Even though the space age pop-music takes on a variety of approaches in style, rhythm, composition and arrangement, it also shows some similarities. For instance, many of the composers associated with the genre used a string orchestra for applying warmth and color to the sound, often combined with a Latin percussion section. A variety of keyboard instruments, from piano to marimbas to organ, are frequently used, and occasionally even the theremin for that out-of-this-world sound. The arrangements of the instruments tend to be highly original, conveying a sense of humor and playful charm. Even the album covers often have space or modernist themes. It is also common for composers to use well-known jazz standards as a basis for their own work and recordings, such as Harlem Nocturne, Caravan and Autumn Leaves. Classical pieces are also popular among space age composers, but almost always arranged in a lighter way than the original. Resurgence in popularity of space age pop in the early 1990s Space age pop, after being largely forgotten after 1963, underwent an enormous surge in popularity in the early 1990s, leading to the release in 1994 of the signature CD compilation of the space age pop music of Juan Garc√≠a Esquivel, Space-Age Bachelor Pad Music, which sold over 70,000 copies. Underground pop band Stereolab, in 1993, released Space Age Batchelor Pad Music [sic], an EP which is said to have factored significantly in raising awareness of the band.

It was adapted from \\"das Pferd Gullfaxi und das Schwert Gunnfj√∂dur\\", a German translation by in his Islandische M√§rchen (1884).. Lang gives Islandische M√§rchen as his source at the end of the tale. Poestion acquired the Icelandic text from his contact, \\"Prof. Steingrimr Thorsteinsson\\". H. J. Ford This tale was the only one in Poestion's book that he did not derive from J√≥n √Årnason's √çslenzkar √ûj√≥√∞s√∂gur og √Üfint√Ωri Vol. 2 (1862‚Äì64), and hence the only one not orally sourced. The Icelandic text, \\"Sagan af hestinum Gullfaxa og sver√∞inu Gunnfj√∂√∞ur\\" was in the manuscript JS 287 4to, dated 1857-1870, now in the possession of the National and University Library of Iceland. Manuscript is titled \\"√ûj√≥√∞s√∂gur 1. hefti (Folktales, 1st book) The Icelandic text was eventually published in volume 4 (1956) of the full expanded edition of J√≥n √Årnason's collection. There are a number of other Icelandic tale specimens in the collection that feature a horse or sword of similar names: Gl√≥faxi og Gunnfj√∂√∞ur, Sagan af hestinum Gullsk√≥ og sver√∞inu Gullfj√∂√∞ur, √ûorsteinn karlsson og hesturinn Gullsk√≥r, Hesturinn Gullsk√≥r og sver√∞i√∞ Dynfj√∂√∞ur. The variants give different names of protagonists, featured motifs, etc. A retold version of it by Ruth Manning- Sanders under the title \\"Sigurd the King's Son\\" is in her anthology, A Book of Ogres and Trolls (1972). Synopsis There was once a kingor \\"petty king\\" whose queen bore her one son named Sigurd (), but she died when the prince was ten years of age. The king grieved his loss for a long time, until one day at the queen's grave (or haugr, a burial mound) he struck friendship with a woman named Ingiborg (Ingibj√∂rg), and some days later the king married her. Sigurd became very fond of his stepmother. One evening Ingiborg spoke to Sigurd and advised him to accompany the king on his hunt the following day. When Sigurd refused, Ingiborg predicted nothing good would come out of his refusal, and hid Sigurd under the bed during the king's absence. In a while, a giantess (or \\"troll-woman\\" in the original) came to visit, addressing Ingiborg as her sister, pressing to know if Sigurd was home. Ingiborg entertained the giantess but persevered in deny Sigurd's presence. The process is repeated the following day, with another giantess asking for Sigurd, without success. The giantess who arrived the third time too would leave empty-handed, so it seemed, but she cleverly managed to lay a spell, which she said would work on Sigurd if he were within earshot. The spell left him horribly disfigured, half scorched and half withered, with an irrepressible longing to seek out the giantess to gain peace of mind. ;Defeating the three giantesses Ingiborg took Sigurd from his hideout under the bed, and chastised his stubbornness, but prescribed a way to remedy the situation. She gave him a ball (or \\"\\" hno√∞a) of string, and three gold rings. If he let the ball of string roll, it would lead him to a giantess,cf. Stith-Thompson motif index D1313.1.1. \\"Magic ball of thread indicates road\\" and though she would threaten to make a meal of him in the pot and seize him with a boat-hook,kr√≥k-stjaki a, m. a boat-hook (Cleasby- Vigfusson dictionary). he should bribe her with the gift of one of the rings. She would then offer to wrestle with him until his strength ran out and offer him a horn to drink out of,Lang says it is \\"wine\\" but this is unspecified in the German or Icelandic originals. which he should accept since a draft of this will make him strong enough to overcome her. He was to repeat the process with her two other giantess sisters. But should Ingiborg's dog appear before him with tears running down its snout, that was the sign that her life was in imminent danger, and he should return to help his stepmother.Lang makes Ingjbj√∂rg's dog a male dog (\\"tears running down his face\\"), but at the conclusion of the Icelandic version, the dog is referred to as \\"the bitch\\" (t√≠kin) He followed her directions, finding all three giantesses in turn, the next giantess increasingly larger and more hideous. Sigurd had to offer a larger ring as bribe at each turn, but he also grew more powerful with the drinking-horn offered by each of the giantesses. ;Befriending Helga, the giant's daughter The last giantess, after her defeat at the end of their bout, now steered Sigurd towards a fresh adventure, declared him \\"stronger than ever you were\\" (that is to say, no longer withered and restored to full health \\"or√∞inn fr√≠skur aftur\\"), and wishing him luck. He was to go to a nearby lake, find a little girl (called Helga) playing with a boat, and befriend her with the gift of a little gold ring that the last giantess provided. Sigurd became the girl's playmate during the day, and when evening fell, persuaded Helga to take him to her home, past her initial objection, on account of her father being a \\"fierce giant\\".The Icelandic original does not state here or anywhere that he is a giant, and instead gives the following: \\"because her father can detect the presence of any strangers in the house\\", √æv√≠ fa√∞ir sinn viti ef nokkur framandi komi √≠ h√∫si√∞. But as soon as they approached the door,Icelandic original has fyrr en hann gengur inn \\"before they entered\\"; German tr. has bevor sie jedoch in das Haus eintrat \\"but before they enter the house\\" Helga brandished her glove (gl√≥fi) over him, transforming him into a bundle of wool (or a \\", or coil\\" of wool, ullar-h√∂nk), which she tossed on her bed. Her father returned, searching every corner,lyktar og leitar \\"sniffing and searching\\" in the original and declared \\"'This place smells of men. What's that you threw on the bed, Helga?\\" (He begins his line with the Icelandic equivalent of \\"Fee-fi-fo-fum..\\" in the original text.Icelandic: Fussum fei, manna√æefur √≠ helli vorum \\"Fie, fy, man's odor in this cave here.\\" (cf. Cleasby-Vigfusson dictionary: fussa \\"to say fie\\"; fussum \\"interj. fie\\"; ADDENDUM fei, fei, \\"fy, fy!\\")) But Helga was able to explain it was just the wool that he smelled. The next day, Helga returned to the lake with the wool bundle and restored Sigurd back to shape with her glove, and they played at the lake during the day. On the third day, her father was going out into town,or kirkju \\"church\\" (acc. sing. of kirkja); German:kirche which meant they had the house to themselves the whole day, and since she was given custody of all the keys, they played games opening every room.In the Icelandic original, they are opening every \\"house\\" h√∫s in the cave-dwelling. Poestion's German version has recast this into opening every \\"room\\" Zimmer in the Haus, and Lang's tale follows suit. But Sigurd noticed there was one key she did not use, and asked her about it. She blushed and did not answer.H√∫n segir √æa√∞ vera aukalykil \\"She answered it was a spare key\\"; German: besonderer Schl√ºssel \\"special key\\". He tried to sway her to show him the unopened room, when he caught glimpse of an iron door, and sweet-talked her into opening it, which she agreed to do so only partially.In Lang, she says \\"if she did open the door it must only be a very tiny chink\\"; in the Icelandic, √≠ h√°lfa g√°tt \\"half open\\". ;Wonderful horse and sword H. J. Ford Inside was a horse named Gullfaxi \\"Golden Mane\\" and a sword named Gunnfoder () \\"Battle-Plume\\".The English translated names for the horse \\"Golden Mane\\" and sword \\"Battle- Feather\\" given here exactly as appended in-text by Lang. Poestion's German tr. also parenthetically gave the meaning of the names as \\"Goldm√§hne\\" and \\"Kampffeder\\". The sword was richly ornamented,or gull-b√∫i√∞ \\"ornamented with gold\\" (neuter form of gull-b√∫inn). German tr. also has ein reich mit Gold verziertes Schwert\\". and had an inscription on its that read \\"He who rides this horse and wears this sword will find happiness\\"(). Sigurd wanted to take a ride on the horse with all its trappings for one circuit, and Helga refused at first but eventually relented and revealed the name of the horse and sword. Much of the exchanged dialogue inserted here by Lang are his embellishments (e.g., \\"'My father is a king, but he has not got any sword so beautiful as that. Why, the jewels in the scabbard are more splendid than the big ruby in his crown! Has it got a name? Some swords have, you know.\\") Helga gave him \\"the stick and the stone and the twig\\" that belonged as a set with the rest.sem me√∞ fylgja has the sense \\"to belong with\\"; German zu dem √úbringen geh√∂ren. Whoever is on the horse's back can throw the twig and have a great forest appear to hinder his pursuer. If the enemy is not foiled, then he can strike (or prick) the stone with the stick and a hailstrom will kill the foe.According to the Icelandic and German versions, the rider must \\"prick the other side of the stone, which is white\\" in order to bring about the hailstorm properly against his enemy, rather than receiving a self-inflicted attack himself. Lang supplies embellishment about the hails being the size of \\"pigeons' eggs\\" and slaying everyone \\"twenty miles around.\\" Helga finally relented under the condition Sigurd would only ride once around, but at the end of the circuit, Sigurd rode away. Helga's father returned to discover the theft and ran after Sigurd riding away on Gullfaxi. (Lang's tale calls the father a giant, but the original merely refers to him as a man or \\"carl\\".. Lang follows the German tr. which designates him as a Riesen \\"giant\\".). Sigurd cast the twig to make a thickly wooded forest emerge, hoping to block his pursuer, but the giant retrieved an axe to cut it down, and was hot on his tail. So Sigurd hit (or poked) the stone causing the hailstorm killing the giant. Had Sigurd hit the stone without turning it over on the other side, he himself would have been struck and killed by the hail. As Sigurd was riding towards his home, his stepmother's dog came running for him, and he hastened back to find nine man-servants (or √ær√¶lar \\"thralls\\") ready to burn Ingiborg at the stake.

Jackson is also a former New Zealand rugby union player. During his playing career, he was a first five-eighth. Domestically, he represented Bay of Plenty and Waikato in the NPC and the Saracens in the UK's Guinness Premiership. His strong performances saw him named in the Chiefs squad for the 1999 Super Rugby season and had international experience as well with New Zealand MƒÅori (now known as the MƒÅori All Blacks) and the Barbarians. Playing career Jackson was part of the 2004 Bay of Plenty Steamers team when they won the Ranfurly Shield. He made his debut for the Chiefs in the opening round of the 1999 Super 12 season. Jackson made his final appearance for the Chiefs in a 2004 Super 12 semi-final defeat to the Brumbies. Jackson was a member of the New Zealand MƒÅori side that won the 2004 Churchill Cup. He signed for Saracens in 2004. In 2007 he was voted The Professional Rugby Players' Association player of the year after being leading points scorer in the 2006‚Äì07 Guinness Premiership. In 2009 he played for the Barbarians. Jackson played his final game for Saracens against Leicester Tigers in the final of the 2009‚Äì10 Guinness Premiership. Referee In 2010 Jackson retired to become a professional referee in his native New Zealand. He was fast-tracked into the professional rugby ranks by Lyndon Bray, then the head of referees for the New Zealand Rugby Union (now known as New Zealand Rugby) and later in the same role with SANZAAR, organiser of Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri Nations). Within a year of Jackson's return to New Zealand, he went from refereeing provincial rugby games in the Heartland Championship to officiating in the ITM Cup at the top provincial level to being an assistant referee in Super Rugby competition. By the end of the 2011 Super Rugby season, he had worked his first match as referee in that competition, having presided over the Hurricanes‚àíWestern Force match on 27 May. Shortly after the end of that season, he made his international officiating debut as television match official for the Bledisloe Cup Test between New Zealand and Australia on 6 August. On 15 February 2015 he made his Six Nations refereeing debut when he took charge of the Scotland- Wales match at Murrayfield. Jackson was the first New Zealander to play and referee 100 first class fixtures when he took charge of the Argentina v South Africa match on 15 August 2015.

Port Simpson), B.C. The name Giluts'aaw means literally \\"people of the inside\\" (referring to their traditional village site behind a small island on a slough along the Skeena). Their traditional territory is the area around Lakelse Lake, near present-day Terrace, B.C., at the Skeena River. Since 1834, they have been based at Lax Kw'alaams, when a Hudson's Bay Company fort was established there. When the village around the fort was laid out into tribal \\"neighborhoods,\\" the Giluts'aaw were the one tribe situated on the shore east of the fort rather than to the west. However, one Giluts'aaw house-group (extended matrilineal family), the House of Niskiimas (belonging to the Ganhada or Raven clan), has members who are today associated with the Kitsumkalum community. In the late nineteenth century the chieftainship of the Giluts'aaw was held by Victoria Young, a key convert of Lax Kw'alaams's Methodist missionary Thomas Crosby. She succeeded to the Giluts'aaw Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) name-title Niis≈Çg√ºmiik of the House of Niis≈Çg√ºmiik, Giluts'aaw's leading royal house, when no male heirs were available. However, despite marrying a holder of the Gispaxlo'ots chieftainship Ligeex, she bore no children and after her death in 1898 the name Niis≈Çg√ºmiik was bequeathed to a brother's son of a different clan whom she had adopted into the Gispwudwada. This person may be Herbert Swanson, whom the anthropologist Marius Barbeau described in 1950 as having been, in 1915, the holder of Niis≈Çg√ºmiik, living at Metlakatla, B.C.. In 1915 the anthropologist Marius Barbeau photographed what remained of a \\"Prince of the Grizzlies\\" totem pole belonging to the Giluts'aaw Gispwuwada House of Niisnawaa at Lax Kw'alaams. The anthropologist Viola Garfield reported in 1938 that the Giluts'aaw was at that point in the situation of having two chiefs. One, Niisnawa, was likely, she wrote, to see his line die out with him as he had no heirs. The second, Niis≈Çg√ºmiik, i.e. Victoria Young's nephew, Garfield considered a \\"subchief\\" to Niisnawa. In 1935 William Beynon recorded that Giluts'aaw people in Lax Kw'alaams included 29 members of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) and 2 members of the Ganhada (Raven). Another house-group, with no members during this period, was the House of Laa'is, of the Laxgibuu (Wolf) clan.

Since 1834, they have been based at Lax Kw'alaams, when a Hudson's Bay Company fort was established there. History The anthropologist Viola Garfield wrote in 1938 that the then- current head chief of the Ginadoiks, Cecil Ross, Niisweexs (\\"Grandfather of Weexs\\"), had come from the Tsimshian community of Kitkatla three generations earlier \\"when his 'brother' usurped his place and took the ... chieftainship\\" of the Kitkatla tribe. The leading, royal house of the Ginadoiks had become extinct, allowing the Kitkatla man to accede to the name Niisweexs. He was succeeded by a \\"house 'nephew'\\", who was in turn succeeded by his sister's son, in accordance with rules of matrilineal succession. One of these last two Niisweexses was Henry Nelson, who died in 1925 and whose mortuary rites are described in detail in Garfield's monograph. In 1935 William Beynon recorded that Ginadoiks people in Lax Kw'alaams included 2 members of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) (i.e. the House of Niisweexs), 7 members of the Ganhada (Raven) (two house-groups, including the House of Niisganaas, with only 2 members), and 18 members of the Laxgibuu (Wolf) (one house-group). One holder of the name Niisganaas, and therefore head of the House of Niisganaas, was Lewis Gray (c. 1857‚Äì1934), was a key informant of Garfield's during her 1932 fieldwork season. He was a shaman whose fame had spread as far as the Nass River, his supernatural gifts having been evident at his birth since he had been born with a caul. Since he had no matrilineal heirs, shortly before his death he adopted his own wife into his house-group as his sister so that she could inherit the prerogatives of the House of Niisganaas.

The film, a music-drama, is centered on a fading country singer's return to his hometown near a military base in Tennessee where several young men who were killed in a training exercise on the base were from. He is reunited with his former sweetheart and estranged daughter, who returns to the town as well. Plot Bo Price (Keith), a down-and-out country singer, has returned home for his brother's funeral following a military training accident. While there, he reunites with his true love, Angela Delton (Preston), a Miami news reporter who has also returned home for her brother's funeral. Bo also meets their 16-year-old daughter, Dixie Leigh Delton (Haun), for the first time. Since Bo walked away from Angela while she was still pregnant, Dixie has never met him or his side of the family. Dixie has experimented with alcohol, but is able to break free with the help of her now- sober father. With her father's musical blood running through her veins, Dixie closes the movie by singing a song she wrote at the memorial for the fallen soldiers. Critical reaction Overall critical reaction was negative. Most critics cited Toby Keith's wooden acting, as well as the blatant product placement by Keith's sponsor, Ford, as major detriments to the film. The general negative consensus was reflected by the poor box office gross of $252,539 in four weeks of release. However, the film has sold over $8 million in DVD sales, and repeated often on CMT, Country Music Television.

Since 1834, they have been based at Lax Kw'alaams, when a Hudson's Bay Company fort was established there. The leadership of the Ginaxangiik resided once in the hereditary name-title 'Alamlaxha and by the early nineteenth century in the hereditary name Txagaaxs. Later, the name 'Wiiseeks, a name belonging to the same royal Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) house-group (extended matrilineal family) as 'Alamlaxha and Txagaaxs, became the leading name. The anthropologist Viola Garfield reported that Albert McMillan held 'Wiiseeks in the 1890s and was thus chief of the Ginaxangiik. McMillan bequeathed the name to a sister's son, who died in 1935 and was succeeded by his brother, a previous holder of 'Alamlaxha. Garfield added in 1938 that in the previous century the Ginaxangiik tribe had had eight tribal chiefs. Garfield has described how in 1929 a holder of the name 'Alamlaxha held a potlatch feast at which a flagpole was erected in lieu of a totem pole, in an attempt to move away from traditional forms. In 1935 William Beynon recorded that Ginaxangiik people in Lax Kw'alaams included 41 members of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) (4 house-groups) and 10 members of the Ganhada (Raven) (1 house-group). The one Ginaxangiik Ganhada house-group in the 1930s was the House of Midiiks. It was headed at the time by Mark Luther, who held the name Midiiks and was a key informant during Garfield's fieldwork. Some of the last living members after Mark Luther were, Robert Sampson, and George Henry, George died in January 1938, and Robert passed some years before. However, well before Robert Sampson died he adopted his three children into the house; William, Matilda, and Elizabeth. Of this adoption five male heirs were the result, the last of which died in 2002. In 2008 a matrilineal descendant of the house returned to Lax Kw'alaams and the house again has members.

In legal terms, Spiritist centres are ordinary non-profit associations, whose members are in charge of providing funds to run the centre itself and the various charity activities kept by it. Each centre is run by a president or one or more directors elected for a term. Spiritist centres differ from Spiritualist churches in that they are not formally organized as ecclesiastical bodies. In addition to the legal and corporeal aspects of its existence, a Spiritist centre is also believed by its members to have an informal and incorporeal level of existence in the spirit world which comprises its patron and a series of protector spirits (which may be shared by other centres in the world). Types of societies There are many types of Spiritist organisations, depending on their goals, formal organisation, size, etc. * Familiar societies (often termed Spiritist Groups) do not have legal existence and conduct their meetings in private homes. Most of the social works provided by such societies is also informal and irregular. * Public societies (the Spiritist centres in the proper sense) must have legal existence and host their meetings in dedicated buildings. They have a fairly large number of members (ranging from about 100 to thousands) and usually provide significant social work, in form of schools, clinics, food distribution for the poor, etc. * Regional and national entities are groups that organise and coordinate the activities of Spiritism state or nationwide. * Virtual societies; these exist only on the internet and provide basic services, including directories of actual meeting places as outlined above. Activities Spiritist centres are complex to define because they are not, in the strictest sense, ordinary religious entities. The activities carried on by a Spiritist centres are of many types: Formation Spiritist centre may be founded by anyone well-versed in Spiritist doctrine. Courses of Instruction Doctrinal classes have a twofold goal: 1) to share the knowledge available in the books and brought by the founders 2) to identify potential mediums and workers. Most Spiritist centres conduct the following courses: * Basic course for beginners‚Äîintended for newcomers, are based on the general aspects of the doctrine. * Study of The Spirits Book * Study of The Mediums Book * Studies of the Gospels and/or The Gospel According to Spiritism * Advanced studies (including The Genesis According to Spiritism, Heaven and Hell, and works of other writers, like L√©on Denis, Chico Xavier, Gabriel Delanne and others, which are regarded as complementary to Allan Kardec. * Basic course for children * Short courses‚Äîmeetings in which other books are studied. The first three courses are almost universal. Proselytism The only form of proselytism found in Spiritism is the disclosure of the doctrine (or aspects of it) to the general public. Divulgation of doctrine is carried on in many ways: * Workshops * Radio transmissions * Websites * Staging of plays featuring the doctrine * Management of a public library containing mostly books on the doctrine or written by mediums Spiritual assistance Spiritists understand the term Spiritual assistance very literally, meaning \\"assistance to the spirit\\" of either a living person or a deceased one. Spiritual assistance offered at Spiritist centres includes disobsession, healing, and blessing (directed to the followers and occasional visitors) as well as medium meetings in which several types of spiritual assistance is directed to spirits of deceased people. Spiritual assistance is intended to fight the four greatest foes of mankind -- suicide, murder (which includes abortion), addiction and envy (which is the cause of most other problems) -- thus reducing the suffering of mankind. The ultimate goal of spiritual assistance is to help our planet to make it through its current stage of evolution, ceasing to be a world of penance to become a happier one. Material assistance Spiritist centres also carry on social works directed to outsiders which are \\"in need of help\\". Material assistance is intended to provide relief to the immediate needs of the poor and the unhappy. In Brazil, Spiritist centres characteristically maintain the following types of charities: * Creches * Kindergartens * Orphanages * Distribution of food for the homeless * Distribution of medicines for the ill (including contraceptives for the poor) Bigger centres may keep clinics, schools, publishing houses, etc. In spite of their respect for homoeopathy, the kind of medicine practised in clinics maintained by spiritist centres and the medicines they give to the poor are both nearly always mainstream.

Port Simpson), B.C. The name Gispaxlo'ots means literally \\"people of the place of elderberries.\\" Their traditional territory includes an area on the Skeena River between present-day Terrace and Prince Rupert. Since 1834, when a Hudson's Bay Company trading fort was established at Lax Kw'alaams, they have been based there. Their chief Ligeex permitted the HBC to build on Gispaxlo'ots territory. Traditionally, the Gispaxlo'ots have been the most powerful of the Tsimshian tribes, due to the exploits and wealth of Ligeex, a great trading chief. As part of the negotiations with the HBC, he arranged in 1832 for his daughter Sudaa≈Ç to marry Dr. John Frederick Kennedy, the first HBC partner of the fort. The House of Ligeex belongs to the Laxsgiik (Eagle clan). Other house-groups (extended matrilineal families) of the Gispaxlo'ots include: * House of Spooxs -- Laxsgiik (Eagle clan) (this house has members associated today with the Kitsumkalum community) * House of Suhalaayt -- Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) (a totem pole belonging to this house was standing in Lax Kw'alaams as recently as the 1930s) * House of T'amks -- Gispwudwada (headed by Arthur Wellington Clah until his death, 1916) * House of 'Wiigyet‚ÄîGispwudada (Killerwhale clan) In 1935 William Beynon recorded that Gispaxlo'ots people in Lax Kw'alaams included 18 members of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) (2 house-groups), 24 members of the Ganhada (Raven) (1 house-group), and 63 members of the Laxsgiik (Eagle) (6 house-groups).

She was a servant for John and Elizabeth Proctor. Renouncing her claims after being threatened to be hanged, she was later arrested for allegedly practicing witchcraft herself, but did not confess. Her life after the trials is unknown. Accusations and involvement in the trials In early March 1692, Warren began having fits, claiming that she saw the ghost of Giles Corey. John Proctor told her she was just seeing his shadow, and put her to work at the spinning wheel, threatening to beat her if she pretended to have any more fits. For some time, she did not report any more sightings, but she started to have fits again. Warren was kept hard at work at the Proctor home and was told that if she ran into fire or water during one of her fits, she would not be rescued. When her seizures did stop, she posted a note at the Meeting House one Sabbath eve to request prayers of thanks. That night, Warren stated that John Proctor woke her to torment her about posting the note. On April 3, 1692, Samuel Parris read Mary's note to the church members, who began to question Warren after the Sunday services. Some took her answers to their questions to mean that the girls had lied. Warren told them she felt better now and could tell the difference between reality and visions. The other girls became angry with Mary and began accusing her of being a witch because she had told the high court that all the girls were lying that they saw the devil. She was formally accused of witchcraft on April 18, 1692.Mary Warren profile, etext.virginia.edu; accessed December 25, 2014. Under questioning she continued to have fits, confessing under duress to witchcraft and began to accuse various people, including the Proctors, of witchcraft. The Crucible Mary Warren is a character in the play The Crucible by Arthur Miller. True to the historical record, she is a maid for John Proctor, and becomes involved in the Salem witch hunt as one of the accusers, led by Abigail Williams. Mary Warren has a very weak character, giving in to pressure a number of times. Proctor manages to convince her to reveal that she and the other accusers have been fabricating their stories and \\"supernatural experiences\\" that have resulted in the arrest of many innocents. However, Warren‚Äôs confession comes to nothing. Williams accuses Warren of witchcraft, which leads to Warren to renounce her confession and accuse Proctor of forcing her to make it. Proctor is later hanged as he renounces his confession to save his heart and soul. In the 1957 and 1996 film adaptations of Miller's play, she was depicted by Pascale Petit and Karron Graves, respectively.

It was first presented as a series of lectures during ‚ÄúWhither Marxism?‚Äù, a conference on the future of Marxism held at the University of California, Riverside in 1993. Summary The title Spectres of Marx is an allusion to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' statement at the beginning of The Communist Manifesto that a \\"spectre [is] haunting Europe.\\" For Derrida, the spirit of Marx is even more relevant now since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the demise of communism. With its death the spectre of communism begins to make visits on the Earth. Derrida seeks to do the work of inheriting from Marx, that is, not communism, but of the philosophy of responsibility, and of Marx's spirit of radical critique. Derrida first notes that, in the wake of the fall of communism, many in the west had become triumphalist, as is evidenced in the formation of a neoconservative grouping and the displacement of the left in third way political formations. At the intellectual level, it is apparent in Francis Fukuyama's proclamation of the end of ideology. Derrida commented on the reasons for that spectre of Marx: :For it must be cried out, at a time when some have the audacity to neo-evangelise in the name of the ideal of a liberal democracy that has finally realised itself as the ideal of human history: never have violence, inequality, exclusion, famine, and thus economic oppression affected as many human beings in the history of the earth and of humanity. Instead of singing the advent of the ideal of liberal democracy and of the capitalist market in the euphoria of the end of history, instead of celebrating the ‚Äòend of ideologies‚Äô and the end of the great emancipatory discourses, let us never neglect this obvious macroscopic fact, made up of innumerable singular sites of suffering: no degree of progress allows one to ignore that never before, in absolute figures, have so many men, women and children been subjugated, starved or exterminated on the earth.Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International, translated by Peggy Kamuf, Routledge 1994 Derrida went on, in his talks on this topic, to list 10 plagues of the capital or global system. And then to an account of the claim the creation of a new grouping of activism, called the \\"New International\\". Derrida's ten plagues are: # Employment has undergone a change of kind, i.e. underemployment, and requires ‚Äòanother concept‚Äô. # Deportation of immigrants. Reinforcement of territories in a world of supposed freedom of movement. As in, Fortress Europe and in the number of new walls and barriers being erected around the world, in effect multiplying the \\"fallen\\" Berlin Wall manifold. # Economic war. Both between countries and between international trade blocs: United States - Japan - Europe. # Contradictions of the free market. The undecidable conflicts between protectionism and free trade. The unstoppable flow of illegal drugs, arms, etc.. # Foreign debt. In effect the basis for mass starvation and demoralisation for developing countries. Often the loans benefiting only a small elite, for luxury items, e.g., cars, air conditioning etc. but being paid back by poorer workers. # The arms trade. The inability to control to any meaningful extent trade within the biggest ‚Äòblack market‚Äô # Spread of nuclear weapons. The restriction of nuclear capacity can no longer be maintained by leading states since it is only knowledge and cannot be contained. # Inter- ethnic wars. The phantom of mythic national identities fueling tension in semi-developed countries. # Phantom-states within organised crime. In particular the non-democratic power gained by drug cartels. # International law and its institutions. The hypocrisy of such statutes in the face of unilateral aggression on the part of the economically dominant states. International law is mainly exercised against the weaker nations. On the New International, Derrida has this to say: :The ‚ÄòNew International‚Äô is an untimely link, without status ... without coordination, without party, without country, without national community, without co-citizenship, without common belonging to a class. The name of New International is given here to what calls to the friendship of an alliance without institution among those who ... continue to be inspired by at least one of the spirits of Marx or of Marxism. It is a call for them to ally themselves, in a new, concrete and real way, even if this alliance no longer takes the form of a party or a workers‚Äô international, in the critique of the state of international law, the concepts of State and nation, and so forth: in order to renew this critique, and especially to radicalise it.

She was one of a handful of AKA's manned by a Coast Guard crew. USS Sheliak served as a commissioned ship for 17 months. Sheliak (AKA-62) was laid down on 19 June 1944 under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 214) by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Kearny, N.J.; launched on 17 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Nellie Blanch Regan; and commissioned on 1 December 1944, Comdr. Searcy J. Lowrey, USCG, in command. Service history Sheliak arrived in Hampton Roads on 14 December 1944 and underwent shakedown training there from 15 to 21 December. After repairs at Norfolk, Virginia, she arrived at Bayonne, New Jersey, on 28 December to load cargo for the Pacific. Departing Bayonne on 4 January 1945, Sheliak delivered her cargo to Pearl Harbor on 25 January. From 2 to 5 February, she underwent training at Pearl Harbor; and, from 5 to 13 February, she received 1,827 tons of Tenth Army equipment, plus other cargo and 201 troops. Departing Pearl Harbor on 15 February, Sheliak arrived at Tulagi on 25 February and underwent pre-invasion training there. Departing Tulagi on 15 March, she arrived at Ulithi on the 21st and sailed from there for the Okinawa invasion on 27 March. Sheliak arrived off the beach at Okinawa on 1 April; and, for the first seven days, provided cargo on call to troops ashore. After general unloading was ordered, she put the Tenth Army cargo ashore between 8 and 17 April. During these operations, she shot down one Japanese aircraft on 15 April. Sheliak departed Okinawa on 19 April; and, sailing via Ulithi and Pearl Harbor, arrived at San Francisco on 14 May. There, her crew altered her cargo spaces to carry ammunition; and, between 28 May and 5 July, she made two round-trips carrying ammunition from Port Chicago, California to Pearl Harbor. She was unloading her third cargo of ammunition at Pearl Harbor when the Pacific War ended, and she returned the ammunition still on board to San Francisco. On 1 October, the cargo ship delivered 18 landing craft to Monterey, California; and, on 15 October, she sailed from San Francisco with general cargo and passengers for various Pacific bases. She called at Pearl Harbor, Manus, Samar, Subic Bay, and Guam before returning to San Francisco on 22 February 1946. On 15 March, she sailed from San Francisco and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 3 April for deactivation. Decommissioning and sale Sheliak was decommissioned on 10 May 1946, transferred to the War Shipping Administration the following day, and struck from the Navy List on 21 May. Sold into mercantile service as SS Pioneer Isle in 1948, she was renamed Australian Isle in 1965 and Transluna in 1969 before being scrapped later that year. Awards Sheliak received one Battle Star for her World War II service.

After the 2010 Census, the number of districts decreased again to 18. On January 22, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania v. the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that the congressional districts were an unlawful partisan gerrymander in violation of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The General Assembly and governor failed to reach an agreement for a revised district map. Therefore, on February 19, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court released a new congressional map. That map is estimated to have a partisan balance of 10 Republican-leaning and 8 Democratic-leaning seats. The court-mandated map was set to apply beginning with the primary elections on May 15, 2018. Republican lawmakers in the state asked for a stay from the United States Supreme Court and brought suit in federal court, seeking an injunction against using the court-drawn map in the upcoming congressional elections. Both attempts failed on March 19, 2018, following rulings by the Supreme Court and a Pennsylvania federal district court. Current districts and representatives The congressional delegation from Pennsylvania consists of 18 members. In the current delegation, 9 representatives are Republicans and 9 are Democrats. Prior to the 2018 House elections, the Republicans had held 12 seats to 6 for the Democrats, and prior to the March 2018 special election in the 18th district, the delegation had consisted of 13 Republicans and 5 Democrats.

In 2012, Pennsylvania realigned a number of districts. A number of sitting congressional representatives had their districts modified or merged as part of the redistricting. The merger of districts 4 and 12 forced a primary runoff between the two sitting congressional representatives. The 2012 redistricting process resulted in a map that disproportionately favored Republican candidates. In the 2012 congressional elections, Democratic candidates won 50.5% of the total votes cast. However, only five of the state's 18 Federal Representatives (27.78%) were Democrats. On June 14, 2017, the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit, alleging that the district boundaries constituted an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The case was eventually appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. On January 22, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the congressional districts were unlawfully gerrymandered in violation of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The court ordered the General Assembly and the governor to adopt a remedied map, to be used for the 2018 congressional elections. Pennsylvania Republicans requested a stay from the United States Supreme Court, to delay the drawing of new district boundaries; however, that request was denied on February 5, 2018. The governor and General Assembly failed to reach an agreement regarding the district boundaries, thus the Pennsylvania Supreme Court drew its own remedial map. On February 19, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court released a new congressional map, to take effect for the May 15, 2018, primaries. The Court voted to implement the new map by a 4‚Äì3 vote. The map was designed with the assistance of Stanford University law professor Nathaniel Persily. The districts in the Court's map were significantly more compact, and its map split fewer municipalities and counties than the prior Republican-drawn map. While the GOP-drawn map had favored Republican candidates, the court-drawn map is expected not to favor one party over the other. Republican lawmakers from Pennsylvania requested that the Supreme Court block the implementation of the court-drawn map; however, on March 19, 2018, the United States Supreme Court denied their request. A Pennsylvania federal district court dismissed a parallel suit on the same day.

The novel is set in Derry, Northern Ireland and extends from February 1945 through July 1971.Deane, Seamus. Reading in the Dark. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. New York: 1996. p.3, p.240 The book won the 1996 Guardian Fiction Prize and the 1996 South Bank Show Annual Award for Literature, is a New York Times Notable Book, won the Irish Times International Fiction Prize and the Irish Literature Prize in 1997, besides being shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1996.http://www.randomhouse.com/book/38182/reading-in-the-dark-by-seamus-deane It has been translated into 20 languages. Plot, structure and themes The story is told from the point of view of an unnamed young Irish Catholic boy living in a poor area of Derry. This novel-in-stories is about both the boy's coming of age and the Troubles of Northern Ireland, from the partition of the island in the early 1920s until July 1971, just after the violent Battle of the Bogside took place in Derry. The setting mirrors mid-twentieth century Derry leading into the Troubles. While the narrator is surrounded with violence, chaos, and sectarian division, Derry serves as the place where he grows up, both physically and mentally. Despite the surrounding events, the narrator's tone never slips into complete despair, but maintains a sense of hope and humour throughout. The main focus of the novel is the young narrator‚Äôs gradual uncovering of a family secret and the effect of this knowledge on him, and on members of his family. A quote in the frontispiece reads: The people were saying no two were e'er wed But one had a sorrow that never was said. The book is divided into three main parts, of two chapters each. These chapters are further subdivided into a series of short stories in strict chronological order, anchored in time by month and year, with short precise titles such as \\"Feet\\"; ‚ÄúFather‚Äù; ‚ÄúMother‚Äù; and ‚ÄúCrazy Joe‚Äù. This structure provides the reader with telling glimpses of crucial events in the narrator‚Äôs life: the gloom of grinding poverty and injustice is relieved at times by hilarious and vivacious dialogue. There is a strong emphasis on the division between Catholics and Protestants and how it affected everyone. The power of the Church and the authority of police, atheism versus faith, the nature of courage, subjugation by various hierarchies, family loves and loyalties, the yearning for education, and the impact of economic hardship are central themes . Seamus Deane has often been asked why \\"Reading in the Dark\\" was not called a memoir rather than a novel, because Deane's upbringing was almost identical to that of the main protagonist, but he usually avoids giving a straight answer, which raises the question for some readers about how much truth lies in fiction. Critique and commentary Reading in the Dark has been the subject of an essay by Dermot Kelly in Moments of Moment: Aspects of the Literary Epiphany.Moments of moment: Aspects of the Literary Epiphany, Wim Tigges, ed., DQR Studies in Literature 25, Rodopi 1999 Kelly describes the work as a \\"metaphysical detective story in which the clues add up to an epiphany of entrapment...Deane's novel excavates nationalist alienation with devastating singlemindedness\\" (p. 435). He also comments on Deane's art as a poet, \\"rehears[ing] certain images until they become emblematic\\", in this case a confrontation between republican gunmen and loyalist police. In Secret Hauntings The Contemporary Irish Novel: Critical Readings Linden Peach, ed., Palgrave 2004 Linden Peach highlights the secrecy which \\"has been such a feature of Irish cultural life\\", and which is portrayed in this work with great poignancy. Deane is concerned with \\"the impact of concealment\\" particularly on \\"the mother figure upon which this burden is most spectacularly visited... Deane's novel seems all the more terrible for being located in an apparently ordinary domestic setting\\". Peach also discusses the way in which Deane's novel incorporates religious symbolism - not only in the way the characters lead their lives, but also in the similarities between Biblical events such as Christ's betrayal and burial and the betrayal and entombment of Uncle Eddie at the Fort. (p. 50). The novel has also been discussed by Amy McGuff Skinner in her 2007 Ph. D. dissertation Intimate Terror: Gender, Domesticity, and Violence in Irish and Indian Novels of Partition.Chapel Hill, 2007 ProQuest Here Deane is quoted as saying: \\"What we misleadingly call ordinary life is destroyed by politics in our part of the world, generation after generation. I had to show how that happens.\\" (p. 161) and further: \\"There's no talking cure, no implication that by revealing everything you will somehow overcome it\\". (p. 176) In her work, McGuff Skinner cites critical writing by Elmer Kennedy-Andrews,(De)-constructing the North: Fiction and the Northern Ireland Troubles since 1969, Four Courts Press 2003 Gerry Smyth,Space and the Irish Cultural Imagination, Palgrave Macmillan 2001 as well as a review by Andrew O'Hehir at SalonIrish Ghost Stories 'Salon', http://www.salon.com/1997/04/11/reading/ History Lessons: Post-colonialism and Seamus Deane's Reading in the Dark, by Liam Harte:Irish University Review, Vol. 30, No I, Special Issue, Contemporary Irish Fiction, (spring-Summer 2000)pp. 149-162\\"...an analysis of the inter-relationship of Irish history, politics, and culture\\".

Born in Southwark to a family which was often in poverty, Dash left school at 14 to work as a page boy at a Lyons Corner House. He later became a hod carrier for a bricklayer, and worked in other jobs for short periods in between which he was unemployed. He enlisted in the Royal Army Service Corps and served for two years; he also became a professional boxer, fighting about a dozen bouts.\\"Jack Dash\\" (obituary), The Times, 9 June 1989. Dash joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1936 and also joined its front organisation, the National Unemployed Workers' Movement. After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 he joined the Auxiliary Fire Service while waiting to join the Royal Navy, although eventually he remained in the AFS (later the National Fire Service) for the rest of the war. In 1945, he found a long-term job as a docker and a member of the Transport and General Workers Union and the National Dock Labour Board. Dash prided himself on having been involved in every London dock strike from 1945 to 1969, stating that all but one had been worthwhile; the exception was an inter-union dispute. He was regarded by some as a firebrand and an agitator and was vilified as a bogeyman by the conservative media in the same manner as Derek Robinson and Arthur Scargill would later be. Dash, who was interested in poetry and would quote Samuel Butler or Robert Browning in his speeches, was often invited to address prestigious bodies: he spoke at 40 student meetings, and opposed the motion 'This House would outlaw unofficial strikes' at the Oxford Union debating society. Jack Dash was the outstanding rank and file leader of his generation in the London docks. Between 1959 and 1972, the wages of dockers trebled.

After a life-time of struggle, Jack retired to become an official London tourist guide and devote more time to his other hobbies of writing and painting. In retirement, Dash became an advocate for pensioners' rights. He was commemorated by the naming of \\"Jack Dash House\\", a municipal office building on the Isle of Dogs. Built by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1990 to honour the London dockers' Communist leader, it houses local council offices and the Jack Dash Gallery which holds regular exhibitions of contemporary art from Britain and around the world. Jack Dash died in London in 1989 at the age of 82. His autobiography Good Morning Brothers!, published in 1969, was a testimony to his work as a militant trade unionist and his lifelong membership of the Communist Party.

Marc Heal took over as vocalist following the departure of original front-man Bill Colbourne, after the recording of a self-titled CD that was released by Canadian label Brouhaha in 1988. The line up in early 1990 was Marc Heal on vocals, Si Rapley on guitar, Graham Rayner on keyboards, and Mick Caddick on drums. In June 1990, Westwon signed to UK metal label Music for Nations on the FAA imprint, releasing two singles: \\"National Radio\\" (1991) and \\"Control\\" (1992). The dance remixes of \\"Control\\" were fair sized club hit. By the time of the single releases, the band became a two-piece with only Heal and Rapley remaining. A second album was recorded but never released. Westwon disbanded in 1992 and Heal went on to form Cubanate with Graham Rayner. Demo Chart interview, 1990 Demo Chart magazine was a short-lived title that promoted unsigned UK acts. An interview with Heal appeared in the May 1990 edition when Westwon reached number one in the magazine's chart. The Canadian label that Heal refers to, Brouhaha, called the interview \\"both fascinating and one-eyed\\". The Head of A&R; for the label at the time claimed \\"the facts are that the label spent in excess of ¬£70,000 recording and mixing, but Westwon refused to promote the first, eponymous album by insisting on a complete remix which would have cost an additional ¬£25,000.

The company borrows money, primarily via short term repurchase agreements, and reinvests the proceeds in asset-backed securities. As of December 31, 2019, 94.2% of the company's assets were mortgage-backed securities issued by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The company generates profits from the net interest spread between the interest earned from its assets and its borrowing costs, which is amplified from the use of leverage. As of December 31, 2019, the company had a debt-to-equity ratio of 11.2. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted average days to maturity of its repurchase agreements was 23.7 days. History The company was founded as Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc. in 1989 by Emmanuel Friedman, Eric Billings, and Russ Ramsey. In 1997, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $206 million. Ramsey left the company in 2001. Following the early 2000s recession, FBR Group invested heavily in subprime mortgages. During the subprime mortgage crisis, the company incurred severe losses related to its underperforming mortgage origination platform and widespread problems in subprime mortgage lending, which led to a sale of ownership in FBR's subprime subsidiary, First NLC Financial Services, in the summer of 2007. Friedman left FBR Group in 2005. In June 2007, FBR Capital Markets was formed through a corporate spin-off from FBR Group. From its founding through 2008, FBR Group was taxed as a real estate investment trust. Starting in 2009, the company converted to a C corporation to use its net operating loss carry-forwards and net capital loss carry-forwards to shield substantially all of its income from income taxes. In May 2009, FBR Group sold a portion of its investment in FBR Capital Markets for $72.5 million. In October 2009, the remaining investment in FBR Capital Markets was sold for $84.1 million. In June 2009, the company changed its name to Arlington Asset Investment Corp. In October 2010, the company settled a shareholder lawsuit in which it was accused of paying substantial bonuses to executives despite poor performance. In June 2014, Eric Billings stepped down as CEO and J. Rock Tonkel, Jr. was appointed CEO with Billings continuing as Executive Chairman. Tonkel previously served as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer. Effective in 2019, the company converted back to a real estate investment trust after it had used its net operating loss carry-forwards. Effective December 31, 2019, Eric Billings retired. Sponsorship The company sponsored the Phoenix Open PGA golf tournament held in Scottsdale, Arizona from 2004 until 2009.

It was formed in 1958, and became an independent non-profit organization in 1973, headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 2018, BSCS changed its name to BSCS Science Learning.BSCS name change announcement History Soon after receiving a National Science Foundation grant in 1958, the American Institute of Biological Sciences established the base for BSCS activities at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Arnold Grobman, a herpetologist, served as the first director of BSCS, from 1958 until 1965. Hiram Bentley Glass, a geneticist, chaired the first Steering Committee (later the Board) from 1959 until 1965. The BSCS leadership during its first decade of operation was mainly made up of professional biologists. These professional biologists worked with high school educators and administrators to develop and implement new curriculum materials. During the first Steering Committee meetings in 1959, the BSCS decided to target high school biology, mainly at the tenth- grade level, for improvement. In the summer of 1960, the BSCS convened an intensive summer writing conference in Boulder, at which three new high school biology textbooks were developed. The three versions were: Blue, a molecular biology approach; Green, an ecology approach; and Yellow, a cellular biology approach. These three versions, and their corresponding newly developed laboratory exercises, were piloted at high schools around the United States during the 1960‚Äì61 school year. The curriculum materials were then revised during the summer of 1961 based on feedback from teachers, students and professional biologists, and tested again during 1961‚Äì62. In 1963, the three textbook versions were published commercially. All three BSCS curriculum versions stressed key biological themes, such as science as inquiry, the complementarity of structure and function, genetic continuity and evolution. The BSCS textbooks emphasized evolution as a major scientific theory at a time when it was largely omitted from existing high school curricula, and the BSCS organization has remained committed to the teaching of evolution since its inception. The BSCS also expanded its work beyond standard tenth-grade biology curriculum to produce educational materials for exceptional students, for teachers, and for all educational levels, from kindergarten to adult. Products To advance the teaching of science, BSCS developed a lesson structure they call the \\"BSCS 5E Instructional Model\\", standing for the different sections of a lesson. It is important to note that it is NOT considered that these 5 sections‚Äîthat this lesson‚Äîwould be done in a single 50-60 minute class period. These 5 E's include: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate. * The five phases of the BSCS 5E Instructional Model are designed to facilitate the process of conceptual change. The use of this model brings coherence to different teaching strategies, provides connections among educational activities, and helps science teachers make decisions about interactions with students. Each phase of the model and a short phrase to indicate its purpose from a student perspective are: Engagement - students‚Äô prior knowledge accessed and interest engaged in the phenomenon Exploration - students participate in an activity that facilitates conceptual change Explanation - students generate an explanation of the phenomenon Elaboration - students' understanding of the phenomenon challenged and deepened through new experiences Evaluation - students assess their understanding of the phenomenon Evolution controversy During the Cold War, in 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first Earth orbiting artificial satellite, Sputnik I. The event triggered alarm in United States by heightening fears there that the Soviet Union were achieving technological and strategic superiority. One response to what the Americans termed the Sputnik crisis was to invest money and expertise towards a re-invigoration of the country's science and technological educational system. It was during this period that the BSCS was engaged to develop updated high school biology textbooks. The biology texts they developed covered evolutionary theory, which was by this time overwhelmingly accepted as biology's central organizing principle. These books became widely used in the nation's high schools, and as a consequence, the public controversy about the teaching of evolution in public schools re- ignited. After a 1968 Supreme Court decision nullified decades-old laws prohibiting the teaching of evolution in many places of the country, some evolution opponents turned their efforts against the public funding of evolutionary teaching, including publicly funded textbooks. The BSCS textbooks were featured in the 1973 case Willoughby v. Stever, a suit filed by an evangelical opponent of evolution who attempted, and failed, to have the evolution instruction in the textbook legally recognized as an unconstitutional establishment of religious secularism. The case was dismissed as meritless, and was cited as legal precedent in other groundbreaking decisions in the American cultural battle over evolution in the schools.

In 1979 two open letters were published in French newspapers defending individuals arrested under charges of statutory rape, in the context of abolition of age of consent laws. Background Michel Foucault argued that children are able to give consent to sexual relations, saying that assuming ‚Äúthat a child is incapable of explaining what happened and was incapable of giving his consent are two abuses that are intolerable, quite unacceptable.‚Äù Foucault, Sartre, and newspapers such as Lib√©ration and Le Monde each defended the idea of child-adult sexual relationships. The petition Michel Foucault stated that the petition was signed by himself, by the novelist/gay activist Guy Hocquenghem, the actor/play-writer/jurist Jean Danet, pediatrician and child psychoanalyst Fran√ßoise Dolto and also by people belonging to a wide range of political positions.Sexual Morality and the Law, Chapter 16 of Politics, Philosophy, Culture ‚ÄìInterviews and Other Writings 1977-1984. Edited by Lawrence D. Krizman. New York/London: 1990, Routledge, , p.275 On April 4, 1978, a conversation detailing the reasons for their pro- abolition positions was broadcast by radio France Culture in the program \\"Dialogues\\". The participants, Michel Foucault, Jean Danet and Guy Hocquenghem, had all signed the 1977 petition, along with other intellectuals. They believed that the penal system was replacing the punishment of criminal acts by the creation of the figure of the individual dangerous to society (regardless of any actual crime), and predicted that a \\"society of dangers\\" would come. They also have defined the idea of legal consent as a contractual notion and a \\"trap\\", since \\"no one makes a contract before making love\\". The conversation has been published as ‚ÄúSexual Morality and the Law‚Äù and later reprinted as \\"The Danger of Child Sexuality\\". Publication of open letters An open letter signed by 69 people, including Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Fran√ßoise Dolto, Philippe Sollers, Alain Robbe-Grillet and Louis Aragon was published in Le Monde, on the eve of the trial of three Frenchmen, (Bernard Dejager, Jean-Claude Gallien, and Jean Burckardt), all accused of having sex with 13- and 14-year-old girls and boys. Two of them had then been in temporary custody since 1973 and the letter referred to this fact as scandalous. The letter claimed there was a disproportion between the qualification of their acts as a crime and the nature of the reproached acts, and also a contradiction since adolescents in France were fully responsible for their acts from the age of 13. The text also opined that if 13-year-old girls in France had the right to receive the pill, then they also should be able to consent, arguing for the right of \\"12- and 13-year-olds\\" \\"to have relations with whomever they choose.\\" A similar letter was published in the paper Lib√©ration in 1979, supporting G√©rard R., an accused child sex criminal awaiting his trial for eighteen months, signed by 63 persons, stating that G√©rard R. lived with young girls aged 6 to 12 and that they were happy with the situation.

Once locally owned, the paper is now part of Morris Multimedia. The editor is Dennis Wyatt.  Community newspaper  The Bulletin is a community newspaper and places a heavy emphasis on local news. Like many community newspapers, the Bulletin does not report national or wire service news on its front page. However, the Bulletin will often localize national news if the story has a local impact, or to get local perspective. Non-local news is typically relegated to the inside pages and is often limited in scope.  Early history  To promote a large-scale water project that was the forerunner to today‚Äôs South San Joaquin Irrigation District, two men - F.L. Wurster and A.L. Cowell - joined forces to print the Irrigation Bulletin in November 1908. Originally printed in Stockton, California, the Bulletin was essentially a series of flyers distributed statewide promoting the irrigation of of sandy loam soil around Manteca. With the help of the South San Joaquin Chamber of Commerce, the Bulletin expanded into a standard-size weekly newspaper on June 3, 1910, when it was moved from Stockton to Ripon. The paper continued to promote the South San Joaquin Irrigation District, which was founded in 1909, and carried news of the district's bond sales to investors throughout California. Water began flowing in 1915 and the South County's population boomed. Several newspapers arose to serve this community, among them the Escalon Times, Lathrop Sun and Ripon Record. The Bulletin changed its name to the Manteca Bulletin on November 6, 1914, and merged on March 22, 1918, with the Manteca Enterprise, which had been founded November 1, 1911. In 1923, George Murphy Sr. partnered with Louis Meyer to purchase the Manteca Bulletin. This began 50 years of ownership by the Murphy family; on April 1, 1972, when George Murphy Jr. sold the Bulletin to Charles Morris and his family-owned Morris Multimedia.  Opinions and plagiarism  In response to an outcry over plagiarism in the newspaper's opinion pages, the Bulletin published an editorial acknowledging the problem in 2009. The newspaper's editorials are characterized by a conservative stance on immigration and social issues. For example, Managing Editor Dennis Wyatt wrote that if immigrants \\"preferred their lives in whatever country they heralded where they weren‚Äôt required to speak English to communicate in a business, in school, on a job or with the government then perhaps they should have thought twice about coming to the United States.\\"  Competition  The paper competes locally with the Modesto Bee, The Record, and the San Joaquin Herald, as well as the weekly Ripon Record.

Even before it became a park, the area, and particularly Hurrah Lake, was the center of leisure activities since the early 1880s. Recreational activities The park has such amenities as bicycling, birding, canoeing, fishing, hiking, horse trails, picnicking areas, wildlife viewing and full camping facilities. Especially known for its mountain biking, it has advanced trails in an area of the park that was once a phosphorus strip mine. The mountain bike trails were originally created and maintained by the SouthWest Association of Mountain Bike Pedalers (SWAMP) club, but are now maintained by the Friends of Alafia club. The forest has grown back. The mine was abandoned before remediation laws took effect, and the area where mountain biking exists is an erratic mixture of pond depressions and abrupt hills jutting from the surface.  Mountain Biking  Alafia State Park is home to 17 miles of bike trails that range from novice to highly advanced sections. The trails are rated Epic by the International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA). The trailhead parking lot consists of bathrooms, bicycle rinsing stations, shaded pavilions, a volleyball net and a playground. Alafia Trails are maintained and kept in safe conditions by the Friends of Alafia on a regular basis. The trails are solely preserved by volunteers so that park staff can focus on resource management tasks and other maintenance.

Contrary to early 8-bit operating systems it is based on a microkernel, which provides preemptive and priority-oriented multitasking and manages random-access memory (RAM) with a size of up to 1024 KB. SymbOS contains a Microsoft Windows like graphical user interface (GUI), supports hard disks with a capacity of up to 128 GB and can already be booted on an unexpanded Amstrad CPC-6128, a 128K-MSX2 and an Amstrad PCW. As of August 30th 2017 it is available for the Amstrad CPC series of computers, all MSX models starting from the MSX2 standard, MSX with V9990 graphics chip, all Amstrad PCW models, CPC-TREX, C-ONE and the Enterprise 64/128 computers.  Motivation and rationale  SymbOS was originally started as an experiment to find out to what extent it is possible to implement a multitasking operating system with a windowed GUI on an 8-bit computer from 1985. GEOS contributed to the motivation, but the structure and features of SymbOS aren't similar to that system. The release in 2006 proved that such a \\"mini windows\\" system is possible on a then 20-year- old home computer with only quantitative limitations. SymbOS is one of the largest retro computing software projects of recent years. One of the goals of the project is to allow these old machines to be used like a modern PC, using hardware extensions. Although only an 8-bit CPU, the Z80 can run a preemptive multitasking operating system. Features such as memory protection, which the Z80 lacks, are not essential in such an OS. For example, AmigaOS also lacks memory protection. The MP/M OS proved that multitasking on the Z80 CPU was possible. Yet, it was generally unavailable for home computers. While the MOS Technology 6502 cannot move the stack pointer, the Z80 can freely relocate it to any position in memory, which makes it easier to implement preemptive multitasking. The existence of an alternative register set accelerates context switching between tasks dramatically. The restriction of Z80 system to a 64 KB address space can be solved with bank switching. In this way, computers like the Amstrad CPC and PCW, MSX, Enterprise or SAM Coup√© can access hundreds or thousands of kilobytes of memory.  Design  SymbOS includes a microkernel, which can perform task management, memory management and inter-process communication.  Task management  For task management, a combination of preemptive and cooperative multitasking was chosen, which makes different task priorities possible. Preemptive means that tasks are interrupted after a certain amount of time by the operating system, in order to share the CPU time with other tasks. Cooperatively means that a task stops using CPU time by itself. It does that, if it's finished with its current job or waiting for a certain event. Because of this combination it is possible to assign priorities. Tasks with low priority get CPU time only if all tasks with higher priorities are not then working.  Memory and banking management  Memory management divides the entire RAM into small 256 byte blocks, which can be assigned dynamically. Applications are always running in a secondary 64 KB RAM bank, where no memory space is occupied by the operating system or the video memory. That makes it possible to reserve up to 63 KB in one piece. Banking management ensures that the system can administer memory with a size of up to one megabyte, even though the Z80 CPU has only a 16-bit address bus. It makes transparent access to memory and functions placed in other 64 KB banks possible.  Interprocess communication  Communication between different tasks and the operating system usually does not take place via calls, but is done via messages. This is necessary inside a multitasking environment to avoid organization problems with the stack, global variables and shared system resources. The SymbOS kernel supports synchronous and asynchronous IPC.  File system management  SymbOS supports the file systems CP/M, AMSDOS, and File Allocation Table (FAT) 12-16-32, on all platforms. With the last one, SymbOS can address mass storage devices with a capacity of up to 128 GB. Also, the ability to administer files with a size of up to 2 GB is uncommon for an 8-bit system. Because of the FAT support data exchange with other computers is quite easy, as most 32 and 64 bit operating systems do support the three FAT file systems.  Interface  Screenshot of the MSX version of SymbOS The graphical user interface (GUI) of SymbOS works in a fully object-oriented manner. The look and feel mimics that of Microsoft Windows. It contains the well-known task bar with the clock and the \\"start\\" menu and can open up to 32 windows that can be moved, resized and scrolled. The whole system is written in optimized assembly language, meaning that the GUI runs as fast as the host machine supports. Content of a window is defined with \\"controls\\" that are primitive GUI elements such as sliders, check boxes, text lines, buttons or graphics. The background or invisible areas of a window don't need to be saved in a separate bitmap buffer. If an area needs to be restored on the display, its contents will be redrawn instead. This makes SymbOS GUI much more memory- friendly compared to most other 8-bit GUIs.  Applications  There are several standard applications available for SymbOS, which are designed to resemble similar software available on other operating systems. Examples include Notepad, SymCommander (similar to Norton Commander), SymShell (cmd.exe), SymZilla (Mozilla Firefox), SymPlay (QuickTime), SymAmp (Winamp) and Minesweeper.  Commands  The following list of commands is supported by SymShell.http://www.symbos.de/appinfo.htm?00025 * ATTRIB * CD * CLS * COLOR * COPY * DATE * DEL * DIR * ECHO * EXIT * FULL * HELP * MD * MOVE * PAUSE * RD * REM * REN * SIZE * TIME * TYPE * VER  Development and release  SymbOS was originally developed for the Amstrad CPC. Its modular structure, with strict separation of general and hardware components, makes porting to other Z80-based systems comparatively easy. The MSX computers starting with the MSX2 standard have been supported since summer 2006. The Amstrad PCW port has been available since August 2007. Versions for the Enterprise 128, the SAM Coup√© and such clones of ZXSpectrum as ATM-turbo 2+ and ZX-Evolution/BaseConf are possible, too, as they fulfill the requirements for SymbOS. By keeping a basic condition for an operating system, the strict separation of hardware and application software by an intermediate layer, SymbOS applications run platform-independently on each computer and need not be adapted for different systems, with the obvious exception of applications that directly access particular hardware.

At the moment the area of the forest is continuously decreasing, both in surface and ecologically. In early 21st century the area is estimated under 35%. Despite the fact that there are still several big forests that have been preserved, including some designated as national parks, the country currently suffers from acute insufficiency of forests (with respect to its normal ecology), translated into poorer and less water for human and irrigation use.

The radio announcer is describing the events happening. The scene then switches to a Kurdish village a few weeks before the Halabja poison gas attack where Ako, a young Kurdish man, is forced to join the Iraqi Army, while he is dreaming of escaping the country. A few dramatic scenes follow, some of them being flashbacks of home. Ako is sent to the frontline with a few Kurdish comrades and is subject to abuse by the other Iraqi soldiers, due to his Kurdish background. There are other scenes depicting abuse also. In one, a man is beaten for refusing to run laps with the others. In another, a firing squad is seen in executing captured Kurdish guerillas. When Ako is given a mission to escort the coffin of a dead Iraqi soldier to his family, an unexpected opportunity for escaping comes up. His driver turns out to be an Arab with strong feeling against the Kurds. They are given a small car with the coffin draped in an Iraqi flag, strapped to the top. The two set out for the long journey across the Iraqi landscape, and encounter a few happenings along the way. In one, they are confronted by a screaming Iraqi woman who is convinced that the dead soldier is her husband. In another, the two men are sitting together as they take a break, and the driver refuses to let Ako look at a picture of his wife. As the journey goes on, Ako does his best to trick the driver into heading toward Kurdistan. He eventually finds his village, now destroyed and abandoned. However, he finds his wife, but their reunion is cut short by an Iraqi bombardment. The setting switches to Ako and his wife in 2003. They discuss how much they lost during the war, and hear the news that Baghdad has fallen to Coalition troops. They are overjoyed, and celebrate their newfound freedom.

Known for most of its length as Fort Smallwood Road, the state highway runs from Fort Smallwood Park near Jacobsville north to MD 2 in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Baltimore. MD 173 connects the beach communities of Riviera Beach and Orchard Beach in northeastern Anne Arundel County and Interstate 695 (I-695) with industrial areas in the Baltimore neighborhoods of Hawkins Point and Curtis Bay, including the United States Coast Guard Yard. MD 173 was mostly constructed in the 1920s and early 1930s. The state highway was put in its modern form with the completion of the bridge over Stony Creek in the late 1940s and expansion to a divided highway between Orchard Beach and Curtis Bay in the late 1970s. Route description View north along MD 173 just south of Riviera BeachMD 173 begins at the entrance to Fort Smallwood Park northeast of Jacobsville. The state highway heads south as Fort Smallwood Road, a two-lane undivided road that passes by several small beach communities on the Hog Neck peninsula. After intersecting Bayside Beach Road, MD 173 turns southwest and passes along the northern edge of Jacobsville, where the highway meets the northern end of MD 607 (Hog Neck Road). The state highway crosses Rock Creek and meets the northern end of Edwin Raynor Boulevard, where the highway turns north onto a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane. MD 173 passes Northeast Senior High School in Riviera Beach before the highway reduces to a two-lane road with center turn lane at its intersection with Duvall Highway. MD 173 continues north into Riviera Beach. At its intersection with Riviera Drive and Bar Harbor Road, the state highway turns west and crosses Stony Creek on a drawbridge. In Orchard Beach, MD 173 intersects the western end of its old alignment, MD 642 (Greenland Beach Road), then expands to a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane. Passing Cox Creek, the state highway becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes the Herbert A. Wagner Generating Station and the adjacent Brandon Shores Generating Station. MD 173 turns north at Solley Road and passes Marley Neck Boulevard before entering the city of Baltimore. Upon entering the Hawkins Point area, the state highway meets Fort Armistead Road, which leads to Fort Armistead Park and an entrance ramp to eastbound I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). MD 173 turns west and its name changes to Hawkins Point Road before the highway intersects Quarantine Road, which leads to a three-quarter diamond interchange with I-695. View south along MD 173 at Patapsco Avenue in Baltimore MD 173 continues west as a four- lane undivided highway through the industrial area of Hawkins Point. The state highway passes MD 172 (Arundel Cove Road) and then the access road to the U.S. Coast Guard Yard. MD 173 crosses a CSX railroad line and expands to a divided highway. The state highway, now named Pennington Avenue, passes under I-695 and then over Curtis Creek on a drawbridge. The state highway meets MD 710 (Ordnance Road) before reducing to an undivided highway and crossing Cabin Branch on twin bridges. MD 173 intersects a CSX rail line at-grade and enters the neighborhood of Curtis Bay. The northbound direction of MD 173 makes a pair of right-angle turns, east onto Birch Street and then north onto Curtis Avenue; the southbound direction uses Pennington Avenue through the neighborhood. Curtis Avenue divides the residential and industrial portions of the neighborhood. MD 173 meets MD 171 (Church Street) within Curtis Bay. At the northern end of the neighborhood, the one-way pair ends and MD 173 turns west onto Patapsco Avenue to pass through Brooklyn as a four-lane undivided street. The westbound highway has an entrance ramp to I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) immediately before reaching its northern terminus at MD 2 (Potee Street). Patapsco Avenue continues as a municipal highway across the Patapsco River toward Southwest Baltimore. MD 173 is part of the National Highway System as an intermodal connector between Quarantine Road in Hawkins Point and Patapsco Avenue in Curtis Bay. The highway is also a National Highway System principal arterial from MD 607 in Jacobsville to Quarantine Road and from Patapsco Avenue to its northern terminus in Baltimore. History Patapsco Avenue was under construction as a wide macadam road by 1911 and completed by 1915. Pennington Avenue from Patapsco Avenue south to Birch Street at the south end of the Curtis Bay neighborhood was paved with wide bituminous concrete by 1915. Both streets and Hawkins Point Road were in Anne Arundel County until the Baltimore city limits expanded to their present boundaries in 1919. MD 173 from the city limit south of Fort Armistead Road to Marley Neck Road was paved in concrete in 1924 and 1925. The adjacent city portion of the state highway was paved northwest to Arundel Cove Avenue in 1925 and 1926. The pavement was extended from Marley Neck Road to the west side of Stony Creek in Orchard Beach in 1928. MD 173 was paved from the east side of Stony Creek east and south to the southern end of Riviera Beach starting in 1930. That segment and the remainder of the highway to Fort Smallwood were complete in 1932. The gap in MD 173 between Arundel Cove Avenue and the south end of the Curtis Bay neighborhood was filled in 1935, completing the wide concrete highway from Baltimore to Fort Smallwood. MD 173's original bridge over Stony Creek between Riviera Beach and Orchard Beach was replaced with a new structure in 1948, replacing a wooden one-lane structure. The approach to the defunct bridge became MD 642. MD 173 was widened to and resurfaced south of Riviera Beach that same year. MD 173 was relocated at its crossing of Curtis Creek contemporaneously with the construction of the Baltimore Beltway through the area. The highway's new four-lane drawbridge over the creek was completed and the highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from MD 710 east to the city limit in 1976. MD 173 was expanded to a divided highway from the city limit southeast to Orchard Beach in 1978. The highway's new dual bridges over Cabin Branch were completed in 1986. Junction listAuxiliary route MD 173A is the unsigned designation for a bypassed section of MD 173 near the intersection of that highway and Edwin Raynor Boulevard. MD 173A runs from MD 173 north to Rock Hill Road near Jacobsville. The state highway was assigned in 2001 when the intersection of MD 173 and Edwin Raynor Boulevard was rebuilt so the roads meet at a right angle.

It is governed by the Censorship of Publications Acts of 1929, 1946 and 1967. The Board has the authority to prohibit any book or periodical that they find to be obscene. This makes it illegal to buy, sell or distribute that publication in the Republic of Ireland. The Board prohibited a large number of publications in the past, including books by respected authors. However, since the 1990s it does not prohibit publications very often.  Establishment  On 2 October 1925, the Minister for Justice, Kevin O'Higgins stated in D√°il √âireann that the existing censorship laws were sufficient to deal with the sale and distribution of obscene literature and that it was not the State's duty to decide what was proper for the Irish public to read. The public disagreed with this, however, and public pressure caused O'Higgins to appoint a Committee on Evil Literature to discover whether it was necessary to extend the government's existing censorship powers so that public morality could be safeguarded. The Committee, initially consisting of a professor of English literature, two members of parliament, a Church of Ireland clergyman and a Roman Catholic priest heard submissions from individuals, organisations and institutions, including religious and social institutions. Its report, which expressed dissatisfaction with the existing laws, was presented to the minister on 28 December 1926. One problem was that the vast majority of the publishers of offensive material operated outside Ireland, leaving only individual booksellers and distributors liable to prosecution. Their prosecution did not have any real impact on the availability of objectionable material. Another problem was that powers of customs and postal authorities to seize this material was ill-defined and seizure was thus ineffectual. The Committee concluded that it was the Irish state's duty to prevent the circulation of publications that were considered to be obscene and morally corrupting. The Committee proposed the introduction of new legislation and the establishment of a censorship board to advise the minister on which publications should be prohibited. The new legislation ‚Äì the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 ‚Äì established the Censorship of Publications Board.  Role and makeup  The Censorship of Publications Board can examine any book or periodical that is for sale in the Republic of Ireland. A publication found to be obscene can be prohibited, making its buying, selling or distribution in Ireland illegal. A prohibition can be appealed to the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board. The Censorship of Publications Board and the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board have five members each. The current Board lasts for five years and its members' term of office will expire in November 2006. None of the members are paid for their services. The members of both boards are appointed by the Minister for Justice. However, both boards are independent authorities and no minister has power over their decisions.  Rules  The Censorship of Publications Board examines any book or periodical referred to it by a Customs and Excise officer or by a member of the public. It can also examine any such publication on its own initiative. If the Board finds a certain publication to be obscene, it can be prohibited for a period of time. During this period any buying, selling or distribution of the publication in the Republic of Ireland is banned. Every member of the board must read the publication in question before deciding whether to prohibit it. For a book to be prohibited, at least three members of the Board must agree with the decision and only one member can dissent. If a prohibition is passed, it comes into effect as soon as it is announced in Iris Oifigi√∫il, Ireland's official State gazette. A book can be prohibited by the Censorship of Publications Board if they consider it to be indecent or obscene. A periodical can be prohibited if it is considered to be frequently or usually indecent or obscene, or if the Board is of the opinion that an unduly large proportion of space in the periodical is given to matters related to crime. A book or periodical may also be prohibited if the Board considers that they advocate abortion or ways of carrying out abortions. Most of the publications considered by the Board have been reported because of obscenity. When considering a book, the Board measures its literary, scientific and historical merit and takes note of its general tenor, the language in which it is written and its likely circulation and audience. A prohibition order on a book lasts for a period of twelve years. A first prohibition order on a periodical is for a period of three, six or twelve months, depending on how often it is published. A second or subsequent prohibition order on a periodical causes it to be permanently banned. A prohibition order can be appealed against by the author, editor or publisher of the book, the publisher of the periodical or by any five members of the Oireachtas. A person convicted of possessing prohibited publications is liable for a fine of ‚Ç¨63.49 or six months imprisonment.  History =Censorship of Publications Act 1929 The laws enacted by the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 were introduced in an era of political isolationism and cultural and economic protectionism. Ireland's culture was very moral and religious. Catholicism ‚Äì the religion of 93% of the population ‚Äì was the fundamental philosophy behind the censorship laws. A main aim of the new legislation was to prevent the introduction of unwholesome foreign influences like materialism, consumerism and immorality from abroad. Specifically, this meant works that were considered to be indecent or obscene, newspapers whose content relied too much on crime, and works that promoted the \\"unnatural\\" prevention of conception or that advocated abortion.Iris Oifig√∫il, 14 May 1930 Irish writers who were found offensive were officially regarded as agents of decadence and social disintegration who were striking at the roots of family life and moral decency. For example, Father P.J. Gannon thought that the Act was 'but a simple measure of moral hygiene, forced upon the Irish public by a veritable spate of filth never surpassed'. He thought that all literature must provide 'noble ground for noble emotion'. President √âamon de Valera felt that the arts in Ireland were to be encouraged when they observed the 'holiest traditions', but should be censored when they failed to live up to this ideal. Although the new laws were typical of censorship laws in many other countries in the 1920s and 1930s, they were implemented with an eagerness which gradually alienated and embittered many Irish writers. It caused some writers to leave the country. The author Mervyn Wall explains that during the 1930s there was 'a general intolerant attitude to writing, painting and sculpture. These were thought dangerous, likely to corrupt faith and morals...One encountered frequently among ordinary people bitter hostility to writers...Obscurantism had settled on the country like a fog, so of course anyone who had eyes to see and the heart to feel, was rebellious.' The Academy of Letters established by William Butler Yeats attempted to fight censorship with solidarity among writers, but it achieved little in this field. The fight against literary censorship was fought mainly by isolated figures. Se√°n √ì Faol√°in, perhaps the most vociferous critic of the censorship laws, wrote: 'Our Censorship...tries to keep the mind in a state of perpetual adolescence in the midst of all the influences that must, in spite of it, pour in from the adult world.' Among the first 13 books to be banned (announced in the Iris Oifig√∫il, in May 1930) were Point Counter Point by Aldous Huxley, The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall and several books on sex and marriage by Margaret Sanger and Marie Stopes. Surprisingly, none of James Joyce's writings were ever banned by the Board, while copies of his works were burnt by the British Customs, and Ulysses was banned in the U.S. for several years.  Emergency Powers Act 1939  The Emergency Powers Act 1939 contained provisions for the censorship of newspapers and periodicals during World War II.  Censorship of Publications Act 1946  In 1942 Eric Cross' book The Tailor and Ansty was banned by the Board. The book was a collection of stories and sayings from an old country tailor called Timothy Buckley and his wife Anastasia that the author had recorded. Although they were exactly the type of Irish people romanticised by de Valera, their real- life language was too broad and racy for the Censorship Board. After the book was banned, three priests forced Buckely to go on his knees and burn the book in his own fireplace. In November 1942 there was an important debate about the censorship system in the Oireachtas. Sir John Keane moved that the Censorship Board be reconstituted. Three banned publications in particular were debated. Sir John Keane was against their censorship, while Professor William Magennis was in favour. Keane read passages from The Tailor and Ansty. The Chairman of the Senate instructed that these passages were deleted from the public report of the debate. The Censorship of Publications Act, 1946 made \\"further and better provision\\" for the censorship of publications. Periodicals that had a large amount of matter related to crime were able to be banned. The Act also established the Appeals Board. The first application made to the Appeals Board involved Brian Merriman's Irish language book The Midnight Court, which had been translated into English by Frank O'Connor. The appeal was dismissed without a hearing for the appealing parties. Many important works of literature continued to be banned by the Board, including East of Eden by John Steinbeck, The Heart of the Matter by Graham Greene and The African Queen by C. S. Forester. Other authors banned included Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert Graves, Ernest Hemingway, D. H. Lawrence, Wyndham Lewis, Thomas Mann, John Cowper Powys, Somerset Maugham and Evelyn Waugh. Irish writers who were censored included Austin Clarke, Benedict Kiely, Edna O'Brien, Kate O'Brien, Frank O'Connor and Se√°n √ì Faol√°in. In 1950, Robert Graves described the Irish censorship laws as 'the fiercest literary censorship this side of the Iron Curtain.'  Arts Council  The Arts Council of Ireland, an autonomous body established by the government to promote, fund and advise the government on the arts, was created in 1951. It was initially headed by Father O'Sullivan, a Catholic priest. The Council took a strong anti-censorship stance and awarded innovative young artists, musicians and writers as winners of the Macaulay Prize, a fellowship, including Noel Sheridan, Se√≥irse Bodley, Brian Friel and John McGahern. McGahern was awarded the Macauley Prize for his first novel The Barracks. He took a year's leave of absence from his position as a teacher in a Dublin primary school to take up the fellowship. However, the Censorship Board banned his second novel The Dark because of its themes of parental and clerical child abuse in June 1965 and he was not allowed to resume his job. The 'McGahern case' became a cause c√©l√®bre and was a significant factor in encouraging the Fianna F√°il government to again amend the censorship law. Censorship of Publications Act 1967 Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Justice, sponsored the Censorship of Publications Act, 1967. This act limited the period of prohibition orders of books to twelve years (although books released after this period could be banned again by the Board). The act thus allowed the immediate sale of over 5,000 previously banned books. Amendments to the 1967 Act In 1976, the Censorship of Publications Board banned the Irish Family Planning Association's booklet Family Planning ‚Äì A Guide for Parents and Prospective Parents ‚Äì the Board considered the booklet \\"indecent or obscene\\". The Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 deleted references to \\"the unnatural prevention of conception\\" in the 1929 and 1949 Acts, thus allowing publications with information about contraception to be distributed in Ireland. The Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for the Termination of Pregnancies) Act, 1995 modified the 1929, 1946 and 1967 Acts to allow publications with information about \\"services provided outside the State for the termination of pregnancies\\". However, no publications that advocated or promoted abortions were permitted. Since 2000 On 11 August 1999, the entertainment listings magazine In Dublin was banned for six months because it was found to 'have been usually or frequently indecent or obscene.' It was investigated after complaints from the public regarding advertisements in the magazine for brothels posing as health studios. However, the Board did not suggest that the magazine's publishers were aware that they were brothels. The High Court lifted the ban, stating that its publishers should have been given the opportunity to state their case before the Board before the ban was implemented. On 18 May 2006 Lee Dunne's novel Paddy Maguire is Dead, a semi- autobiographical novel about a writer's descent into alcoholism, was released in Ireland after being banned for thirty-four years. The book was originally published in the United Kingdom in 1972, but was banned in Ireland on its release because it was thought to be indecent and obscene. The next six of his novels were also banned, making Dunne the most banned author in Ireland. He was unable to get a new book published in Ireland until the late 1980s. From 2000 to January 2018, a total of 34 periodicals and 11 books were referred to the board, of which 7 publications (all in 2003) were prohibited, and one book: \\"The Raped Little Runaway\\", for containing \\"numerous explicit descriptions of the rape of a child\\", the first book banned since 1998. Criticisms The Censorship of Publications Act, 1967 remains in force even though the Irish social climate has greatly changed in the interim. Some current criticisms of the board include the fact that its meetings are held in secret, that all complaints must be considered by the board (for example, the Bible had to be considered when it was submitted in 1988), and that the board operates generally on the basis of standards and criteria that are vague and ill-defined. A thoroughly researched critical study was published in 1968 by Michael Adams, Censorship: the Irish experience, University of Alabama Press.

McBride also represented both Scotland and the Scottish League. Career McBride was born in Govan, just 200 yards from Ibrox Park, the home of Rangers. He attended St. Gerard's RC Secondary, Govan and was a prolific goalscorer for their teams (where he played alongside future banker and football chairman Brian Quinn). He signed for Kilmarnock when he was 15, and was loaned out to Junior sides Shettleston and Kirkintilloch Rob Roy.

McBride quickly regained his goalscoring form with Hibs, scoring on his debut against Rangers, followed by a hat-trick in his second match against Lokomotive Leipzig, and four goals in his third match against Morton.

It was a practical joke program purporting to be a chess game in high-resolution (hi-res) graphics, but which actually contained no chess or graphics. When the unsuspecting user tried to run the program, it promptly crashed with a syntax error, appearing to return the user to the Applesoft BASIC command line input mode. However, when the user attempted to use any BASIC or Apple DOS commands, there would be humorous results, since the program was actually still running and only pretending to be the Apple's command line processor. Many different commands were \\"parodied\\", with silly error messages resulting. \\"Tog\\" later expanded the program to include both the LISP and UCSD Pascal language syntax, redistributing it under the name \\"Cattlecar Galactica.\\"An Interview with Krakowicz, by Jason Scott, ASCII, TEXTFILES.COM, February, 2005, ...The most forgotten program is likely ‚ÄúCattlecar Galactica.‚Äù Bruce Tognazzini...put together a hilarious, comprehensive disk that took command-line inputs and corrupted them in very funny and clever ways. If you typed in ‚ÄúHGR,‚Äù the response was ‚ÄúRCH,‚Äù the acronym for the smallest known measurement in the English language. The original disk was copyable, but when you tried to load it, it switched back and forth between two disk modes, and just went ‚Äúswish- swish‚Äù endlessly in the drive. You had to sector-read it and fix the intentional error to play the game‚Äìin other words, you had to be an Apple cognoscenti in order to appreciate his humor and genius. One instruction would give the plaintive response ‚ÄúFree the Milpitas 8!‚Äù...RIAG Crate 010: 114 Volume 114, Internet Archive, ...Disk directory for 114_Volume_114.dsk:...I 012 CATTLECAR GALACTICA 3.0... The program's name appeared in the directory of the floppy disk, but opening and listing this file revealed no useful contents. Instead, the user found only hundreds of page-feed commands and a small amount of seemingly random code. That's because that's all there was. The actual program on the disk was hidden in plain sight. It was called \\"Applesoft,\\" for Applesoft BASIC, the name of Microsoft's floating point BASIC licensed by Apple in the early years. Because programmers expected to see a copy of Applesoft on every disk, they would never even suspect they should look there for the program. Naive users, on the other hand, were just as likely to look there as anywhere else, giving them the upper hand in discovering the actual program. The way out of the program‚Äîthe goal of the game‚Äîwas equally stacked against programmers. The magic word for escaping the program and gaining access to the code was \\"egress,\\" with sufficient clues that English majors could easily escape, but programmers unfamiliar with the word could not. (English majors often found their way out within about 30 minutes; some programmers took a week or more, working their way through the disk by track and sector, looking for clues in the underlying code.) Tog had barely started on the program when a group of other Apple programmers gathered around to play with it. Steve Jobs happened upon them, yelled that it was a complete waste of time, and sent everyone back to work, forbidding Tog to work on it any more. Based on this admonishment, Tog did little else but work on it for the next seven weeks, releasing it free to the Apple II user groups, which rapidly spread it around the world. The story of Steve's intervention appeared in the movie, Pirates of Silicon Valley, where the program was referred to as \\"a parody of BASIC.\\" References 1978 video games Apple II games Apple II-only games Parody video games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Super Hi-Res Chess"},{"id":"6323445","text":"Dr. Marc J.

Pinched or compressed nerves may result from herniated discs, lumbar spinal stenosis, or spondylolisthesis. The traditional technique for decompression of lumbar nerves is laminectomy, a surgical procedure developed in the early 1900s. In laminectomy, the paraspinal muscles are dissected off the spine bilaterally, that is on the left and right sides of the spinal column. The lamina and spinous process are then removed to gain access to the nerves contained within the spinal canal. The structures that are compressing the nerves (usually ligamentum flavum and herniated disc) are then trimmed until the nerves are free from compression. Laminectomy is an effective procedure for relieving pressure on spinal nerves, but during the procedure, many spinal stabilizing structures are destroyed even though they are not directly compressing the nerves (lamina, spinous process, interspinous ligament, supraspinous ligament). The reason for that is that these structures are \\"in the way,\\" that is they block the surgeon's access to the spinal canal. In some patients, excessive spinal destabilization and muscle damage from laminectomy results in \\"postlaminectomy syndrome.\\" This medical condition is characterized by chronic back pain and weakness. During the 1980s spinal surgeons began to use operating microscopes in order to improve visualization of the spinal nerves during surgery. The use of the operating microscope in spinal surgery allows the procedure to be performed through a smaller incision and with greater safety because the surgeon's visualization of nerve tissue is improved. Around this time, Dr. John A. McCulloch developed a technique for decompressing spinal nerves while minimizing the amount of \\"collateral damage\\" to supporting spinal ligaments, bones, and muscles. In contrast to traditional laminectomy, the lamina, spinous process, inter- and supraspinous ligaments are preserved. Also, the spinal musculature is dissected away from the spinal bones only on one side, rather than on the left and right sides. Despite the fact that microsurgical lumbar laminoplasty is an effective and less-invasive method for decompressing spinal nerves compared to traditional laminectomy, few surgeons have adopted it because the technique is more time consuming and requires specialized training and equipment (operating microscope). Practitioners of microsurgical lumbar laminoplasty include Dr. Nima Salari of Desert Institute for Spine Care (Phoenix, Arizona), Dr. Russel C. Huang of the Hospital for Special Surgery (New York, NY), Dr. K. Daniel Riew of Washington University (St. Louis, MO), Dr. Bradley K. Weiner (Akron, OH), and Dr. David A. Wong of the Denver Spine Center (Denver, CO).

The cats would be arranged according to the natural tone of their voices.  Origins  There is no official record of a cat organ actually being built; rather it is described in literature as a bizarre concept. \\"The details of the cat organ present it clearly as an instrument cat lovers might wish was a fictional horror.\\"Betancourt, Michael (2011). The instrument is used in stories which criticize the cruelty of royalty while the piganino, a similar instrument using pigs, has been used to criticize the poor. from J-B. Weckerlin, Musiciana (1877) This instrument was described by the French writer Jean- Baptiste Weckerlin in his book Musiciana, extraits d'ouvrages rares ou bizarres (Musiciana, descriptions of rare or bizarre inventions):Weckerlin, Jean-Baptiste (1877). Musiciana, extraits d'ouvrages rares ou bizarres, p.349. Paris: Garnier Freres. Cited in The instrument was described by German physician Johann Christian Reil (1759‚Äì1813) for the purpose of treating patients who had lost the ability to focus their attention. Reil believed that if they were forced to see and listen to this instrument, it would inevitably capture their attention and they would be cured: \\"A fugue played on this instrument--when the ill person is so placed that he cannot miss the expression on their faces and the play of these animals--must bring Lot's wife herself from her fixed state into conscious awareness.\\" from Richards, Robert J. \\"Rhapsodies on a Cat-Piano, or Johann Christian Reil and the Foundations of Romantic Psychiatry\\", 1998. The instrument was first described by Athanasius Kircher in his 1650 work Musurgia Universalis, though the lack of an image may have left doubt in the minds of some writers. (The New York Times, for example, has carried an article claiming he described the instrument, and another stating he did not describe it in Musurgia Universalis.). His description appears in Book 6, Part 4, Chapter 1, under the heading \\"Corollaria,\\" (emphasis added): from Gaspar Schott, Magia Naturalis (1657) The citation is noted by Kircher's student Gaspar Schott in Magia Naturalis naturae et artis, Part 2, Book 6, Pragmatia 2, titled \\"Felium Musicam exhibere [Cat Concert].\\": Text and Image at Linda Hall Library.  Modern citations and reconstructions  Michael Betancourt compares the sampling of cats' meows used in Jingle Cats' albums, Meowy Christmas (1993) and Here Comes Santa Claws (1994), to the cat organ, in that both require cats, but diminish each performer's importance. Kircher notes that the instrument can be used to reduce the melancholy of princes by moving them to laughter, almost exactly the situation that occurred in 2010 when Prince Charles was greatly amused by a performance of the tune \\"Over the Rainbow\\" on an instrument recreated using squeaky toy cats by Henry Dagg for a garden party held at Clarence House supporting Charles's Start initiative for sustainable living. In 2009, The People's Republic of Animation, a professional animation studio, released an animation titled The Cat Piano. This work tells the tale of a city of cats whose musicians are kidnapped by a human in order to make a cat piano. This short film has received several awards, as well as nominations for awards.

This allows use of the Media Center and its features (such as view photos, videos, listen to music, watch live television and use DVR functions, watch recorded TV, etc.) on a television receiver or other electronic visual display. The advantage with these devices is that a household's primary computer, hosting Media Center, need not be near the device used for display. Additionally, with an Extender, the Media Center can be accessed at the same time by several users. The Xbox 360 gaming console has Media Center Extender functionality. The Ceton Echo is a stand-alone extender. Technology Media Center Extenders (MCX) can either be dedicated hardware devices, such as set top boxes or televisions, or software based implementations such as the Xbox 360. First generation hardware based devices were based on the Windows CE operating system whereas the second generation devices can use other embedded OSs such as Linux as well. The Extender creates its own user account on the host PC(MCX1, MCX2, etc.) and then uses a version of Fast User Switching to enable the use of the host computer and Extenders at the same time. Version 1 Extenders only support Media Center versions up to Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 Update Rollup 2 - they cannot support the version of Media Center incorporated in Windows Vista Home Premium/Ultimate Edition and later. The server software, which runs on the host PC and streams the media, is built into Windows Media Center. An MCX device must be paired with the MCE software before use; this is done by pairing the MCE software with an identifying number generated by the MCX device. The MCE software makes the user interface available via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP, which is also used by Remote Desktop client). All processing done by the MCE software and plug-ins happen at the host computer; only the user interface is streamed to the MCX devices. As such, the device can render the interface even though the Media Center-specific software (or the plug-ins) might not be installed there. However, the media files are streamed over a different protocol. To render the media, an implementation of the codec used to package the media must be locally installed on the Extender; having the codec on the host computer is not enough. Alternatively media can be trans-coded on the fly by the host computer to a codec that is supported by the Extender. In Windows 7 this is now a standard feature which will probably relieve Extender vendors in the future from having to include such a wide variety of codecs. Version 1 Extenders * HP x5400 * Linksys WMCE54AG * Xbox with Media Center Extender Add-On All Version 1 Extenders have been discontinued and are not supported in Windows Vista. Version 2 Extenders For quite some time, the Xbox 360 was the only Version 2 Extender available that could work with Windows Vista. When connecting an Xbox 360 to a Windows XP Media Center Edition PC, a free download is required to connect for the first time. When connecting an Xbox 360 to a Windows Vista PC, no download is necessary as all required components are built into Windows Vista. Microsoft eventually announced the v2 Media Center Extenders from partners (Linksys, D-Link and Niveus Media) on 5 September 2007.Microsoft Press release on Windows Media Center V2 Extenders Version 2 capable Extenders support animated transitions between screens and additional capabilities of Windows Vista to handle newer video formats, notably, DivX, Xvid, Windows Media Video HD and H.264. They can stream HDTV (including 1080p) through HDMI like the Xbox 360, can stream protected content and many incorporate draft 802.11n wireless connectivity. In addition to these updates, Extender manufacturers will be able to integrate Extender technology into other popular consumer electronics devices. Examples include DVD players, HDTVs, HD DVD players, Blu-ray players, etc. Windows Media Connect and Windows Media Player Network Sharing are able to connect to them on Windows XP; however, they do not work with Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 as extenders.V2 Extenders To Be Vista Only Xbox 360 is the only device that can work as an extender with both Windows XP Media Center as well as Windows Vista.

The Ceton Echo claims to use less than 5 W. Energy cost depends upon electricity prices, model, and use, but for an Xbox 360 running continuously can be a significant fraction of the purchase price every year.

Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. He is a young turkey vulture (commonly called a \\"buzzard\\" in the United States) with black body feathers and a white tuft around his throat. His neck is long and thin, bending 90 degrees at an enormous Adam's apple. His neck and head are featherless, and his beak is large and yellow or orange, depending on the cartoon. The character is depicted as simpleminded with drawled speech, a perpetual silly grin, and partially-closed eyes. Beaky was partly based on Edgar Bergen's puppet Mortimer Snerd. Short subjects The character first appeared in the 1942 cartoon Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid, directed by Bob Clampett. The cartoon's plot revolves around the hopeless attempts of the brainless buzzard, here called Killer, to catch Bugs Bunny for his domineering Italian mother back at the nest. Beaky's voice was reminiscent of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen's character Mortimer Snerd (his in-studio name was in fact \\"Snerd Bird\\", bestowed by Bob Clampett himself; he was not named \\"Beaky\\" on-screen in this first appearance). The voice itself was provided by voice actor Kent Rogers. Clampett brought the character back in the 1945 film The Bashful Buzzard, a cartoon that closely mirrors its predecessor, only this time featuring Beaky's hapless hunting (contrasting with the war-like formation flying and dive bombing of his brothers) without Bugs as an antagonist. Rogers reprised his role as the character's voice for the film, but he was killed in a Naval aviation training accident at Pensacola, Florida before finishing all his dialogue, so Stan Freberg was brought in to finish the work. Clampett left the studio in 1946, ending Beaky's career for a time. The character was eventually brought back in the 1950 Friz Freleng film The Lion's Busy, now voiced by Mel Blanc. Freleng made the buzzard smarter, pitting him against a dim-witted lion named Leo. Bob McKimson also featured the character in a film that year, Strife with Father. McKimson's Beaky is again back to his idiotic self, this time under the tutelage of his adoptive father, a sparrow who is trying to teach Beaky how to survive in the wild. Later minor appearances Beaky has had minor roles in various Warner Bros. projects, such as Tiny Toon Adventures, where he plays the mentor of the character Concord Condor, and the movies Space Jam (1996) and 2003's Looney Tunes: Back in Action as an Acme pilot, voiced by Joe Alaskey. Beaky Buzzard appeared in The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries in the episode \\"3 Days & 2 Nights of the Condor\\", where he was voiced by Jeff Bennett. Beaky's mother, who appeared in many of his original shorts, also appeared in an episode of the show (voiced by Tress MacNeille). Beaky's most recent appearance was in an episode of Looney Tunes Cartoons, namely \\"Buzzard School\\", where Bugs Bunny teaches Beaky how to hunt rabbits. Comics and merchandising Beaky is featured in several issues of Dell Comics' Looney Tunes comic book series, usually paired with another minor player, Henery Hawk, and additionally appeared in a print spinoff of Space Jam in 1997. The character was licensed for Looney Tunes merchandise such as a metal coin bank, and, in 1973, a collectible Pepsi bottle.

The facility is located next to the community of Sonyea in Groveland on the site of a former Shaker community. The town is south of Rochester, Monroe County, New York, near Interstate 390. The prison is divided into 2 parts, upper and lower, with a fence and sally port to restrict movement between the two. Dorms C-J, the prison hospital and food service are on the upper. Dorms K and L, as well as the commissary, school, church and recreation yards are on the lower. The recreation yards feature 3 softball diamonds, a weight yard and horseshoe pits. In the past, female prisoners were held at Groveland, but it is currently a male facility. As of 2010 Groveland had a working capacity of 1106. History The Shakers owned the Groveland Shaker Village after 1836, when they moved from Sodus in Wayne County, New York to escape worldly influences. When the membership of the sect declined, the Shakers sold the land to the state after they were assured it would be used for good purpose. Several of the Shaker buildings are still used today. At the end of the 19th century, the state opened a facility epileptics here.

The Fivefold Scapular, also known as Redemptorist Scapular, is a sacramental made up of the five most popular scapulars in the Catholic Church: the Brown Scapular, the Blue Scapular, the Black Scapular, the Red Scapular, and the White Scapular. History The Fivefold Scapular originally was a four-fold scapular (Brown, Black, Blue, and white), and is known as Redemptorist Scapular, since the Redemptorist Fathers were first granted special faculties, in perpetuity, by the Holy See to bless and invest the scapulars in 1803 and to enroll the faithful into the respective confraternities. In 1847, the Red Passionist Scapular was added to the other four to become the current form of Fivefold Scapular, and in 1886 Pope Leo XIII gave permission to bless and enroll the five scapulars cumulatively, and later the Church extended the faculty (to bless and enroll the Fivefold Scapular) to any priest.  The Brown Scapular  The Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (Brown Scapular). The Brown Scapular (also known as the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, or simply as the Scapular) is the most popular scapular. It was given to Simon Stock by Our Lady of Mount Carmel, who promised him that \\"whoever dies clothed in this scapular shall not suffer the eternal flames.\\" Later, she appeared to Pope John XXII as the Mediatrix of all graces, promising him that \\"whoever shall wear my Scapular faithfully, pray the Divine Office [various indults have applied in the past and apply today], and exercise chastity in their state of life shall not suffer Hell, and if they should go to Purgatory, I shall bring them to Heaven on the First Saturday after their death\\" (Sabbatine Privilege). The Brown Scapular has been praised by numerous popes. Venerable Pope Pius XII said that the Brown Scapular is \\"a sign of consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary\\" and that \\"the scapular is not superstitious... One is not saved from Hell merely by wearing it. No, for it is a sign that they must live their lives in total obedience to God and trust in him, through and with the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\\" In 1917, the Virgin Mary appeared in F√°tima, Portugal, as Our Lady of the Rosary, holding not only the Holy Rosary but also the Brown Scapular. Moreover, in her final apparition, during the Miracle of the Sun, one of the three seers, after known as Sister L√∫cia, saw Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Furthermore, it was to Saint Dominic that the Virgin Mary appeared with the Rosary and the Brown Scapular, her arms outstretched (a gesture of prayer), saying, \\"One day by the Rosary and the Scapular I will save the world\\". Finally, the members of the Blue Army of Our Lady of F√°tima wear the Brown Scapular as a sign of personal consecration to Our Lady of F√°tima.  The Blue Scapular  The Blue Scapular (also known as the Scapular of the Immaculate Conception) is due to Venerable Ursula Benicasa, founder of the Order of Theatine Nuns, when a group of wealthy young women who had given up their wealth in order to live for Jesus Christ had wanted to honor the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Virgin Mary had promised Benicasa that whoever wore her Scapular would be under her special protection and receive special graces through her maternal intercession. The Blue Scapular was highly praised by Pope Clement X.  The Black Scapular  The Black Scapular (also known as the Scapular of the Seven Sorrows of Mary) was revealed to Pope Alexander IV shortly after he had sanctified the Servite Order in 1255. Our Lady of Sorrows had promised that whoever meditated upon her seven dolors would receive her special protection at the hour of death.  The Red Scapular  Scapular of the Passion. The Red Scapular (also known as the Scapular of the Passion of Our Lord and the Sacred Hearts and Jesus and Mary) was revealed to Sister Apolline Andriveau, a Daughter of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, in 1846. The Lord promised that whoever wore his Scapular would be granted a great increase of faith, hope, and charity every Friday (the office day of the Passion). The apparition was repeated several times, and in the following year Pope Pius IX sanctified the sacramental on June 25, 1857.  The White Scapular  Scapular of the Most Holy Trinity (White Scapular). The White Scapular (also known as the Scapular of the Most Holy Trinity) is the usual habit of the Secular Third Order of the Most Holy Trinity and is worn also by members of the Confraternity of the same Order (the Trinitarians). Saint John de Matha during his first Mass (around 1193) had a vision of Christ between two captives (http://www.trinitari.org). The Christian captive had a staff with a red and blue cross on the top in the Greek form (+).

The crash was caused by Senator Edward M. (Ted) Kennedy's negligence and resulted in the death of his 28-year-old passenger Mary Jo Kopechne, who was trapped inside the vehicle. Kennedy left a party on Chappaquiddick at 11:15p.m. Friday, with Kopechne. He maintained his intent was to immediately take Kopechne to a ferry landing and return to Edgartown, but that he accidentally made a wrong turn onto a dirt road leading to a one-lane bridge. After his car skidded off the bridge into Poucha Pond, Kennedy swam free, and maintained he tried to rescue Kopechne from the submerged car, but he could not. Kopechne's death could have happened any time between about 11:30p.m. Friday and 1a.m. Saturday, as an off-duty deputy sheriff maintained he saw a car matching Kennedy's at 12:40a.m. Kennedy left the scene and did not report the crash to police until after 10a.m. Saturday. Meanwhile, a diver recovered Kopechne's body from Kennedy's car shortly before 9a.m. Saturday. At a July 25, 1969 court hearing, Kennedy pled guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and received a two-month suspended jail sentence. In a televised statement that same evening, he said his conduct immediately after the crash \\"made no sense to me at all\\", and that he regarded his failure to report the crash immediately as \\"indefensible\\". A January 5, 1970 judicial inquest concluded Kennedy and Kopechne did not intend to take the ferry, and that Kennedy intentionally turned toward the bridge, operating his vehicle negligently, if not recklessly, at too high a rate of speed for the hazard which the bridge posed in the dark. The judge stopped short of recommending charges, and a grand jury convened on April 6, 1970, returning no indictments. On May 27, 1970, a Registry of Motor Vehicles hearing resulted in Kennedy's driver's license being suspended for a total of sixteen months after the crash. The Chappaquiddick incident became national news that influenced Kennedy's decision not to run for President in 1972 and 1976, and it was said to have undermined his chances of ever becoming President.NY Daily News: Kennedy's Legacy: Chappaquiddick was the end of one Ted Kennedy and the beginning of another Kennedy ultimately decided to enter the 1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries, but earned only 37.6% of the vote and lost the nomination to incumbent President Jimmy Carter. Background U.S. Senator Edward M. (Ted) Kennedy, age 37, and his cousin Joseph Gargan, 39, planned to race Kennedy's sailboat Victura in the 1969 Edgartown Yacht Club Regatta on Friday and Saturday, July 18 and 19, 1969, after having forgone the previous year's Regatta because of the assassination of Kennedy's brother Robert that June.Damore, p. 69. Gargan rented secluded Lawrence Cottage for the weekend on Chappaquiddick Island,Damore, pp. 69‚Äì70. which is a tiny island accessible by ferry from Edgartown on Martha's Vineyard. They hosted a cookout party at the cottage at 8:30p.m that eveningKessler, p. 418. as a reunion for the \\"Boiler Room Girls\\", women who had served on Robert Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Six of these attended the party: Mary Jo Kopechne, Rosemary Keough, Esther Newberg, sisters Nance and Mary Ellen Lyons, and Susan Tannenbaum. All were in their twenties and single. The men at the party included the crew of Kennedy's sailboat entered in the regatta: Gargan; Paul Markham, a school friend of Gargan who had previously served as the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts;Wills, pp. 117‚Äì120. and John B. Crimmins, 63, a long-time political associate of Kennedy who served as his chauffeur for the weekend. Also there were attorney Charles Tretter, a Kennedy advisor; and Raymond LaRosa, who had worked on Kennedy's senate campaigns. All the men were married except Crimmins; wives were not invited to the Chappaquiddick weekend.Bly, pp. 202‚Äì206. Other friends and campaign workers, male and female, had been invited, but for various reasons did not attend. Markham and Crimmins intended to spend the night at the cottage, while the other men had rooms at the Shiretown Inn one block from the Edgartown ferry slip, and the women had rooms at the Katama Shores motor inn about south of the ferry slip.Boyle, p. 124 Sequence of events=The crash The Dike Bridge is accessible only by a dirt road, and leads to dead-end sand dunes past Poucha Pond. The guardrail was not present in 1969. According to Kennedy, Kopechne asked him to give her a ride back to her hotel in Katama. Kennedy requested the keys to his car (which he did not usually drive) from his chauffeur Crimmins.Boyle, pp. 26‚Äì27, reported at Damore, p. 357. Kennedy put this time at \\"approximately 11:15p.m.\\", although he was not wearing a watch; the time came from Crimmins' watch.Damore, p. 357. Returning to Edgartown and Katama required making the last ferry, which left the island at midnight, or else calling to arrange a later ferry. Kopechne told no one else that she was leaving for the night with Kennedy, and in fact left her purse and hotel key at the party. The exact time the crash occurred is unknown, due to a conflict between the testimony of Kennedy and a deputy sheriff who claimed to have seen his car at a later time. Kennedy claimed as soon as he left the party, he immediately drove north on Chappaquiddick Road headed for the ferry landing, and mistakenly made a wrong turn right onto the dirt Dike Road, instead of bearing left to stay on the paved Chappaquiddick Road for another . There is also a northbound dirt Cemetery Road, at this intersection. Part-time Deputy Sheriff Christopher \\"Huck\\" Look left work by 12:30a.m. on Saturday as a gate guard in uniform for the regatta dance, returned to Chappaquiddick Island in the yacht club's private boat, and drove east and south on Chappaquiddick Road toward his home. At around 12:40a.m., after he passed the intersection with Dike Road, he saw a dark four-door sedan driven by a man with a woman in the front seat, approaching and passing slowly in front of him. The car drove off the pavement onto Cemetery Road, and stopped. Thinking the occupants of the car might be lost, Look stopped and walked towards the other vehicle. When he was away, the car reversed and started backing up towards him. As he called out to offer help, the car moved forward and veered quickly eastward onto Dike Road, speeding away and leaving a cloud of dust.Exhumation hearing, p. 59, reported at Damore, p. 103. Look recalled that the car's license plate began with an L and contained two 7s, consistent with Kennedy's license L78‚Äì207 on his Oldsmobile Delmont 88. He returned to his car and continued on his way south. Look's version, if true, leaves over an hour of Kennedy's time with Kopechne unaccounted for, before the crash. About a minute later, Look saw Kennedy's party guests Nance and Mary Ellen Lyons, and Ray LaRosa, dancing in a conga line down the middle of Chappaquiddick Road, a short distance south of Dike bridge. He stopped to ask if they needed a lift, which they declined. LaRosa and the Lyons sisters corroborated Look's testimony about meeting him in the road and the verbal exchange, but they were unsure of the time. They also said they saw a vehicle driving north on Chappaquiddick Road, which they could not describe in any detail. Dike Road leads to Dike Bridge,Boyle, p. 123 a wooden structure angled obliquely to the road, crossing the channel connecting Cape Pogue Pond to the north and Pogue Pond to the south, leading eastward to a barrier beach known as Tom's Neck Point. At the time, the bridge was not fitted with guardrails. A fraction of a second before Kennedy reached the bridge, he applied his brakes and lost control of the car, which launched over the southern end of the bridge, plunged nose-first into the channel, and flipped over, resting on its roof. Rescue attempts Dike House along Dike Road is 150 yards from the bridge. Kennedy was able to swim free of the vehicle, but Kopechne was not. Kennedy said that he called her name several times from the shore and tried to swim down to reach her seven or eight times. He then rested on the bank for around 15 minutes before he returned on foot to Lawrence Cottage. He denied seeing any house with a light on during his 15-minute walk back.Boyle, p. 56‚Äì60, reported at Damore, p. 360. His route back took him past four houses from which he could have telephoned to summon help before he reached the cottage, but he did not attempt to contact the local residents.Anderson & Gibson, p 138‚Äì140. The first of the houses was Dike House, from the bridge and occupied by Sylvia Malm and her family. Malm stated later that she was home, she had a phone, and she had left a light on at the residence when she retired that evening. Kennedy returned to the cottage, where the party was still in progress, but rather than alerting all of the guests to the crash, he quietly summoned Gargan and Markham, and collapsed in the back seat of a rented Plymouth Valiant parked in the driveway. Gargan drove the three to the site of the crash in order to try to rescue Kopechne from Kennedy's overturned car. Gargan and Markham jumped into the pond and tried repeatedly to rescue her, but were not able to due to the strong tidal current. After they recovered, Gargan drove Kennedy and Markham to the ferry landing. The three were all lawyers, and they discussed what they should do while standing next to a public phone booth at the landing. Gargan and Markham insisted multiple times that the crash had to be reported to the authorities.Boyle, p. 63, reported at Damore, p. 362. Kennedy's reaction Kennedy suddenly dove into the channel, swam the across to Edgartown and returned to his hotel room, where he removed his clothes and collapsed on his bed. He later put on dry clothes, left his room, and asked someone what the time was; it was somewhere around 2:30 a.m., he recalled. Meanwhile, Gargan and Markham had driven the rental car back to the cottage; they entered the cottage at approximately 2 a.m. but told no one what had happened. When questioned by the guests, they said that Kennedy had swum back to Edgartown, and Kopechne was probably at her hotel. Gargan then told everyone to get some sleep. By 7:30 a.m., Kennedy was talking casually to the winner of the previous day's sailing race and gave no indication that anything was amiss. At 8 a.m., Gargan and Markham had crossed back to Edgartown on the ferry and met Kennedy. Recovery of body A short time after 8 a.m., a man and fifteen- year-old boy who went fishing off Tom's Neck Point, saw Kennedy's submerged car in Poucha Pond and notified the residents of the cottage nearest the scene, who in turn called the authorities at about 8:20 a.m.Damore, p. 1. Edgartown Police Chief Dominick James Arena arrived at the scene about 10 or 15 minutes later.Cutler, p. 10, 42. He attempted to examine the interior of the submerged vehicle,Lange & DeWitt, p. 40‚Äì41. then summoned a trained scuba diver and equipment capable of towing or winching the vehicle out of the water. John Farrar, captain of the Edgartown Fire Rescue unit, arrived at 8:45 a.m. equipped with scuba gear and discovered Kopechne's body in the back seat; he extricated it from the vehicle within 10 minutes.Damore, p. 6.Cutler, p. 10. Police checked the car's license plate and saw that it was registered to Kennedy. Rosemary Keough's purse was found in the front passenger compartment of the car, causing Arena to misidentify Kopechne.Damore, p. 8. Meanwhile, Kennedy, Gargan, and Markham crossed back to Chappaquiddick Island on the ferry, where Kennedy made a series of telephone calls from a pay phone near the ferry crossing‚Äîthe same phone that the three men had stood by approximately six hours earlier discussing Kennedy's options. Kennedy called friends and lawyers for advice, however, instead of notifying the authorities that he was the operator of the vehicle, which was still upside down in Poucha Pond. He called his brother-in-law Stephen Edward Smith, congressman John V. Tunney, and others that morning, but he still did not report the accident to authorities. Kennedy was still at the pay phone when he heard that his car and Kopechne's body had been discovered; he then crossed back to Edgartown to go to the police station with Markham. Meanwhile Gargan went to the Katama Shores to inform the Boiler Room Girls of the incident. Kennedy entered the police station at approximately 9:50a.m.. He asked to make some telephone calls, and was told he could use Arena's office. When Arena returned to the station at 10:00, he was \\"stunned\\" to learn Kennedy already knew of the accident and the true identity of the victim, and admitted he was the driver.Arena's personal notes, p. 1, cited in Damore, p. 16. Arena led Kennedy to another empty office where he could privately dictate his statement to Markham, who wrote it out in long hand. Arena then typed out the statement:Damore, pp.21‚Äì22. > On July 18, 1969, at approximately 11:15 p.m. in Chappaquiddick, Martha's > Vineyard, Massachusetts, I was driving my car on Main Street on my way to > get the ferry back to Edgartown. I was unfamiliar with the road and turned > right onto Dyke [sic] Road, instead of bearing hard left on Main Street. > After proceeding for approximately one-half mile on Dyke [sic] Road I > descended a hill and came upon a narrow bridge . The car went off the side > of the bridge. There was one passenger with me, one Miss Mary___, a former > secretary of my brother Sen. Robert Kennedy. The car turned over and sank > into the water and landed with the roof resting on the bottom. I attempted > to open the door and the window of the car but have no recollection of how I > got out of the car. I came to the surface and then repeatedly dove down to > the car in an attempt to see if the passenger was still in the car. I was > unsuccessful in the attempt. I was exhausted and in a state of shock. I > recall walking back to where my friends were eating. There was a car parked > in front of the cottage and I climbed into the backseat. I then asked for > someone to bring me back to Edgartown. I remember walking around for a > period and then going back to my hotel room. When I fully realized what had > happened this morning, I immediately contacted the police. Kennedy said the statement was correct as Arena typed it, but did not sign it.Boyle, p. 125. As the Medical Examiner Dr. Robert Nevin had the day off, Associate Medical Examiner Dr. Donald Mills was called to the crash site to examine the body. He was satisfied that the cause of death was accidental drowning, but asked the District Attorney's office for direction on whether an autopsy was necessary, and was told it wasn't as long as there were no signs of foul play and he was satisfied it was a drowning. He signed the death certificate to that effect and released the body for embalming, and directed that a blood sample be collected and sent to the State Police for analysis of alcohol content.Damore, p. 31 The result was 0.09%, which Mills mistakenly thought represented only a \\"moderate\\" level, but in fact indicated in a person of Kopechne's weight, up to five drinks of liquor within an hour prior to death.Damore, p. 178 Kopechne's body was released to her family, and the funeral was held on Tuesday, July 22, in Plymouth, Pennsylvania.Damore, p. v. ME Nevin strongly disagreed with Mills' decision to forgo autopsy,Damore, pp. 174‚Äì175. believing that ruling out foul play would work to Kennedy's advantage by laying prurient public speculation to rest.Damore, p. 270. Disputed cause of death Farrar, who recovered Kopechne's body from the submerged car,John Farrar interview on the Howie Carr Show believed that Kopechne died from suffocation rather than from drowning or from the impact of the overturned vehicle, based upon the posture in which he found the body in the well of the back seat of the car, where an air pocket would have formed. Rigor mortis was apparent, her hands were clasping the back seat, and her face was turned upward.Klein, p. 93. Bob Molla, an inspector for the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles who investigated the crash at the time, said that parts of the roof and the trunk appeared to be dry. Farrar publicly asserted that Kopechne would have probably survived if a more timely rescue attempt had been conducted.Kappel. Defense strategy Edgartown and Chappaquiddick Island in relation to the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, south of Cape Cod Kennedy returned to his family's compound in Hyannis Port. Stephen Smith, Robert McNamara, Ted Sorensen, Richard N. Goodwin, Lem Billings, Milton Gwirtzman, David W. Burke, John Culver, Tunney, Gargan, Markham, and others arrived to advise him. Smith, the Kennedy family business manager and \\"master fixer\\", resigned himself to the fact that the political damage had been done, and Kennedy's chance of running for President at the next available window, 1972, was gone. The problem remained how to protect him from a charge of manslaughter. Arraignment Kennedy's court hearing was held before Massachusetts District Court Judge James Boyle on July 25, seven days after the incident. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident causing bodily injury. His attorneys argued that any jail sentence should be suspended, and the prosecutors agreed by citing his age (37), character, and prior reputation.Damore, pp. 192‚Äì193. \\"Considering the unblemished record of the defendant, and insofar as the Commonwealth represents this is not a case where he was really trying to conceal his identity...\\", Boyle sentenced him to the statutory minimum two months in prison, which he suspended, saying that he \\"has already been, and will continue to be punished far beyond anything this court can impose.\\"Damore, p. 193. Despite an Associated Press story published that morning, Boyle was unaware that Kennedy's driving record was, in fact, far from \\"unblemished\\". While attending University of Virginia School of Law (1956‚Äì1959), he had compiled a record of reckless driving and driving without a license. In one particular March 14, 1958, incident, Kennedy ran a red light, then cut his tail lights and raced to avoid a highway patrol officer. When Kennedy was caught, he was cited for reckless driving, racing to avoid pursuit, and driving without a license.Damore, pp. 169‚Äì170. Kennedy's wife Joan was pregnant at the time of the Chappaquiddick incident. She was confined to bed because of two previous miscarriages, but she attended Kopechne's funeral and stood beside her husband in court.Taraborrelli, p. 395‚Äì96, 399. Soon after, she suffered a third miscarriage,Taraborrelli, p. 192. which she blamed on the Chappaquiddick incident. Kennedy's televised statement At 7:30 p.m. on July 25, Kennedy delivered a lengthy speech about the incident, prepared by SorensenDamore, pp. 173, 200 and broadcast live by the three television networks. He began by reading the speech off a prepared manuscript.The entire speech was inquest exhibit #3 and can be found at Damore, pp. 203‚Äì206. Kennedy explained that his wife did not accompany him to the regatta due to \\"reasons of health\\". He denied he engaged in any \\"immoral conduct\\" with Kopechne or driving under the influence of alcohol that evening. He said that his conduct during the hours immediately after the accident \\"made no sense to me at all\\" and said his doctors had informed him he had suffered \\"cerebral concussion and shock\\". He said he regarded his failure to report the accident to the police immediately as \\"indefensible\\". To the horror of Gargan's attorney, his statement revealed his enlistment of the help of Gargan and Markham to try to rescue Kopechne (despite assurances he had made to the effect that he would not involve them). He said \\"all kinds of scrambled thoughts\\" went through his mind after the accident, including \\"whether the girl might still be alive somewhere out of that immediate area\\", whether \\"some awful curse actually did hang over all the Kennedys\\", whether there was \\"some justifiable reason for me to doubt what had happened and to delay my report\\", and whether \\"somehow the awful weight of this incredible incident might in some way pass from my shoulders.\\" He said he was overcome \\"by a jumble of emotions‚Äîgrief, fear, doubt, exhaustion, panic, confusion, and shock.\\" He said he instructed Gargan and Markham \\"not to alarm Mary Jo's friends that night,\\" then returned to the ferry with the two men and \\"suddenly jumped into the water and impulsively swam across, nearly drowning once again in the effort, returning to my hotel around 2 a.m. and collapsed in my room.\\" Kennedy then put down his manuscript (though he continued reading from cue cards), and asked the people of Massachusetts to decide whether he should resign: The speech concluded with a passage quoted from John F. Kennedy's book Profiles in Courage (ghostwritten by Sorensen): \\"A man does what he must‚Äîin spite of personal consequences\\".Damore, pp. 206, 208. Critical reaction to the speech was immediate and negative. NBC newsman John Chancellor compared it to Richard Nixon's 1952 Checkers speech. Kennedy admirer David Halberstam wrote in Harper's magazine that it was \\"of such cheapness and bathos as to be a rejection of everything the Kennedys had stood for in candor and style. It was as if these men had forgotten everything which made the Kennedys distinctive in American politics and simply told the youngest brother that he could get away with whatever he wanted because he was a Kennedy in Massachusetts.\\" Inquest Although Kennedy received many messages from voters opposed to him resigning from the Senate, reaction in much of the news media, and of District Attorney Edmund Dinis, was that Kennedy's televised speech left many questions unanswered about how the accident happened, and his delay in reporting it. On July 31, 1969, the same day Kennedy returned to his Senate seat,Damore, p. 240. Dinis wrote to the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court, Joseph Tauro, asking for a judicial inquest into Kopechne's death.Damore, pp. 239‚Äì240. He received a response the next day that such inquests are under jurisdiction of the District Court. Dinis then sent his request to Kenneth Nash, the Chief Justice of the lower court.Damore, p. vi. Nash advised Dinis that a grand jury investigation had more \\"teeth\\" than an inquest, as it had the power to indict defendants, whereas an inquest was only authorized to determine if a crime has been committed. Dinis met with Edgartown District Court Judge James Boyle on August 8 to explain his reasons for requesting the inquest. Boyle did not recuse himself, even though he had presided over the hearing at which Kennedy pled guilty.Damore, p. 266. Boyle announced the inquest was scheduled to start on September 3, and would be open to the press.Damore, p. 267. On September 2, Kennedy's lawyers petitioned the Massachusetts Supreme Court for a temporary injunction against the inquest, which was granted. Exhumation battle Dinis petitioned for an exhumation and autopsy of Kopechne's body, and on September 18, 1969, he publicly disclosed that blood had been found on her long-sleeved blouse and in her mouth and nose, \\"which may or may not be consistent with death by drowning\\",Damore, p. 307. when her clothes were given to authorities by the funeral director. Judge Bernard Brominski of the Court of Common Pleas in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, held a hearing on the request on October 20‚Äì21. The request was opposed by Kopechne's parents. Forensic pathologist Werner Spitz testified on behalf of Joseph and Gwen Kopechne that the autopsy was unnecessary and the available evidence was sufficient to conclude that Kopechne died from drowning. Judge Brominski ruled against the exhumation on December 1, saying that there was \\"no evidence\\" that \\"anything other than drowning had caused the death of Mary Jo Kopechne.\\"Damore, p. 343. The inquestChappaquiddick Inquest - Boston.com convened in Edgartown in January 1970. At the request of Kennedy's lawyers, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ordered it to be performed secretlyTrotta, p. 184.Bly, p. 213. with Judge James A. Boyle presiding, and the 763-page transcript was released four months later. Kennedy's testimony Kennedy testified, when he was about to leave the party, Kopechne told him \\"that she was desirous of leaving\\" and asked \\"if I would be kind enough to drop her back at her hotel.\\" Crimmins and some other guests \\"were concluding their meal, enjoying the fellowship and it didn't appear to be necessary to require him to bring me back to Edgartown.\\" Witnesses at the party variously placed the time of Kennedy and Kopechne's departure between 11:00 and 11:45p.m.. Kennedy also testified that he never stopped on Cemetery Road, never backed up, never saw the deputy, and never saw another car or person after he left the cottage with Kopechne. He further claimed that after he turned onto Dike Road, he was driving and did not realize that he was no longer headed west toward the ferry landing but was instead heading east toward the barrier beach. Kennedy estimated his speed at the time of the accident to be \\"approximately \\".Boyle, p. 35, reported at Damore, p. 358. Kennedy testified that he had \\"full intention of reporting it. And I mentioned to Gargan and Markham something like, 'You take care of the other girls; I will take care of the accident!'‚Äîthat is what I said and I dove into the water.\\" Kennedy had told Gargan and Markham not to tell the other women anything about the incident \\"because I felt strongly that if these girls were notified that an accident had taken place and Mary Jo had, in fact, drowned, that it would only be a matter of seconds before all of those girls, who were long and dear friends of Mary Jo's, would go to the scene of the accident and enter the water with, I felt, a good chance that some serious mishap might have occurred to any one of them.\\"Boyle, p. 80, reported at Damore, p. 363. Kennedy testified that he was back at the hotel and \\"almost tossed and turned and walked around that room.... I had not given up hope all night long that, by some miracle, Mary Jo would have escaped from the car.\\"Boyle, p. 70, reported at Damore, p. 364. Kennedy complained to the hotel owner at 2:55 a.m. that he had been awakened by a noisy party.Boyle, p. 70, reported at Damore, p. 364. At 8 a.m., Gargan and Markham found him at his hotel where they had a \\"heated conversation\\" in Kennedy's room. According to Kennedy's testimony, the two men asked why he had not reported the accident, and he responded by telling them \\"about my own thoughts and feelings as I swam across that channel... that somehow when they arrived in the morning that they were going to say that Mary Jo was still alive.\\" Gargan and Markham's testimony Markham testified that after their rescue attempt, Kennedy was sobbing and on the verge of becoming crazed.Boyle, p. 322, reported at Damore, p. 375. Gargan and Markham testified that they assumed that Kennedy was going to inform the authorities about the accident once he got back to Edgartown, and so they did not do the reporting themselves. In an October 15, 1994, interview for Ronald Kessler's book The Sins of the Father: Joseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty He Founded, Gargan said that he and Markham returned to the scene of the accident with Kennedy, they both urged Kennedy to report the accident to the police. \\"The conversation was brief about having to report\\", Gargan told Kessler, a former The Washington Post reporter, for the book. \\"I was insistent on it. Paul Markham was backing me up on it. Ted said, 'Okay, okay, Joey, okay. I've got the point, I've got the point.' Then he took a few steps and dove into the water, leaving Markham and I expecting that he would carry out the conversation.\\"Kessler, p. 419. Farrar's testimony Farrar testified: Farrar testified that Kopechne's body was pressed up in the car in the spot where an air bubble would have formed. He interpreted that to mean that she had survived in the air bubble after the car submerged, and he concluded that: Farrar believed that Kopechne \\"lived for at least two hours down there.\\" Findings Judge Boyle released the following findings in his report:Dinis, p. 391‚Äì392. *\\"Death probably occurred between 11:30p.m. on July 18 and 1:00a.m. on July 19, 1969.\\" *\\"Kennedy and Kopechne did not intend to return to Edgartown at that time; ... Kennedy did not intend to drive to the ferry slip and his turn onto Dyke [sic] Road had been intentional.\\" *\\"A speed of twenty miles per hour as Kennedy testified to, operating the car as large as his Oldsmobile, would be at least be negligent and, possibly, reckless. If Kennedy knew of this hazard, his operation of the vehicle constituted criminal conduct.\\" *\\"Earlier on July 18, he had been driven over Chappaquiddick Road three times, and over Dyke Road and Dyke Bridge twice. Kopechne had been driven over Chappaquiddick road five times and over Dyke Road and Dyke Bridge twice.\\" *\\"I believe it probable that Kennedy knew of the hazard that lay ahead of him on Dyke Road, but that, for some reason not apparent from the testimony, he failed to exercise due care as he approached the bridge.\\" *\\"I, therefor [sic], find there is probable cause to believe that Edward M. Kennedy operated his motor vehicle negligently‚Ä¶ and that such operation appears to have contributed to the death of Mary Jo Kopechne.\\" Having found probable cause of a crime, under Massachusetts law Boyle could have issued a warrant for his arrest, but he did not do so.Dinis, p. 392. Despite Boyle's findings, Dinis chose not to prosecute Kennedy for manslaughter. The Kopechne family did not bring any legal action against him but did receive a payment of $90,904 from him personally and $50,000 from his insurance company.Bly, p. 216. The Kopechnes later explained their decision not to take legal action by saying, \\"We figured that people would think we were looking for blood money.\\" Grand jury investigation On April 6, 1970, a Dukes County grand jury assembled in special session to investigate Kopechne's death. Judge Wilfred Paquet instructed the members of the grand jury that they could consider only matters brought to their attention by the superior court, the district attorney, or their personal knowledge. He cited the orders of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and told the grand jury that it could not see the evidence or Boyle's report from the inquest, which were still impounded. Dinis had attended the inquest and seen Boyle's report, and he told the grand jury that there was not enough evidence to indict Kennedy on potential charges of manslaughter, perjury, or driving to endanger. The grand jury called four witnesses who had not testified at the inquest; they testified for a total of 20 minutes, but no indictments were issued. Motor Vehicles investigation On July 23, 1969, the registrar of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles informed Kennedy that his license would be suspended until there was a statutory hearing concerning the accident.Press release of Registrar McLaughlin, July 23, 1969, reported at Damore, p. 165. The suspension was required by Massachusetts law for any fatal motor vehicle accident if there were no witnesses. The in camera hearing was held May 18, 1970, and found that \\"operation was too fast for existing conditions.\\" On May 27, the registrar informed Kennedy in a letter that \\"I am unable to find that the fatal accident in which a motor vehicle operated by you was involved, was without serious fault on your part\\" and so his driver's license was suspended for a further six months.Facsimiles of the hearing report and the letter are at Damore, pp. 449‚Äì50. Fringe theories Journalist Jack Olsen wrote the first investigative book on the case, The Bridge at Chappaquiddick, in 1970, attempting to solve the unanswered questions of the incident. Lieutenant Bernie Flynn, a state police detective assigned to the Cape Cod district attorney's office, was a Kennedy admirer who came up with a theory which he couldn't prove: that Kennedy got out of the car, and Kopechne drove herself off the bridge. \\"Ted Kennedy didn't want to admit being drunk with a broad in a car late at night. When he saw 'Huck' Look he got scared. He thought a cop was coming after him.\\" Flynn claimed to have told this theory to Olsen, who didn't seem to be very impressed.Damore, p. 309 Although Olsen denied having ever talked to Flynn, he related this theory in his book.Damore, p. 350 Kopechne was , a foot shorter than Kennedy, and Olsen argued that she might possibly not have seen the bridge as she drove Kennedy's car over unfamiliar roads at night with no external lighting, and after she had consumed several alcoholic drinks. He wrote that Kopechne normally drove a Volkswagen Beetle, which was much smaller, lighter and easier to handle than Kennedy's larger Oldsmobile 88.Olsen. A BBC Inside Story episode titled \\"Chappaquiddick\\", broadcast on July 20, 1994 (the 25th anniversary of the incident), repeated Flynn's theory. The episode argued that the explanation would account for Kennedy's lack of concern the next morning, as he was unaware of the accident, and for the forensic evidence of the injuries to Kopechne being inconsistent with her sitting in the passenger seat. Chappaquiddick resident Bill Pinney, in his 2017 book Chappaquiddick Speaks, presents a theory that Kopechne was seriously injured in an earlier crash, and then the bridge accident was faked. Aftermath National Lampoon fake VW Beetle ad mocking the incident. Visit Print Magazine for a higher-resolution image where the ad copy is legible The case evoked much satire of Kennedy. For example, Time magazine reported immediately after the incident that \\"one sick joke already visualizes a Democrat asking about Nixon during the 1972 presidential campaign: 'Would you let this man sell you a used car?' Answer: 'Yes, but I sure wouldn't let that Teddy drive it. A mock advertisement in National Lampoon magazine showed a floating Volkswagen Beetle, itself a parody of a Volkswagen advertisement showing that the vehicle's underside was so well sealed that it would float on water, but with the caption \\"If Ted Kennedy drove a Volkswagen, he'd be President today.\\" The satire resulted in legal action by Volkswagen, claiming unauthorized use of its trademark; the matter was later settled out of court. Following his televised speech on July 25 regarding the incident, supporters responded with telephone calls and telegrams to newspapers and to the Kennedy family. They were heavily in favor of his remaining in office, and he was re- elected in 1970 with 62% of the vote, a margin of nearly a half million votes but it was down from 74% in the previous election in 1964. The incident severely damaged Kennedy's national reputation and reputation for judgment. One analyst asked, \\"Can we really trust him if the Russians come over the ice cap? Can he make the kind of split-second decisions the astronauts had to make in their landing on the moon?\\" Before Chappaquiddick, public polls showed that a large majority expected Kennedy to run for the presidency in 1972, but he pledged not to run in 1972. Further, Kennedy declined to serve as George McGovern's running mate that year. In 1974, he pledged not to run in 1976, in part because of the renewed media interest in Chappaquiddick. The incident robbed Chappaquiddick of its traditional peace and privacy, attracting large tourist groups wanting to view the sites connected with the tragedy, as lamented by a 4th-generation resident, Bill Pinney, author of Chappaquiddick Speaks (2017).Pinney, Bill. Chappaquiddick Speaks, Stormy Weather Press, 2017. . p. vii-viii. In late 1979, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency when he challenged President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for the 1980 election. On November 4, 1979, CBS broadcast a one- hour television special presented by Roger Mudd, titled Teddy. The program consisted of an interview with Kennedy; the interview was interspersed with visual materials. Much of the show was devoted to the Chappaquiddick incident. During the interview, Mudd questioned Kennedy repeatedly about the incident and at one point directly accused him of lying.Barry, p. 182. Kennedy also gave what one author described as an \\"incoherent and repetitive\\" answer to the question, \\"Why do you want to be President?\\" The program inflicted serious political damage on Kennedy.Boller, p. 355.Barry, p. 188.Baughman, p. 169.Jamieson, p. 379‚Äì81. Carter alluded to the Chappaquiddick incident twice in five days, once declaring that he had not \\"panicked in the crisis.\\" Kennedy lost the Democratic nomination to Carter, who, in turn, lost the general election to Ronald Reagan by a landslide. After the incident, he won seven re- elections to the US Senate. Kennedy remained a senator until his death in 2009. After Kennedy's death, New York Times Magazine editor Ed Klein stated that Kennedy asked people, \\"Have you heard any new jokes about Chappaquiddick?\\" \\"It's not that he didn't feel remorse about the death of Mary Jo Kopechne,\\" Klein argued, \\"But that he still always saw the other side of everything and the ridiculous side of things, too.\\" The Dike Bridge became an unwanted tourist attraction and the object of souvenir hunters. Nance Lyons stated in a 2008 interview that the women present at Chappaquiddick had suffered both professionally and personally.  Media  The incident is fictionalized in Joyce Carol Oates' novella Black Water (1992). It is the central subject of John Curran's film Chappaquiddick (2017). A similar, fictional incident inspired by the Chappaquiddick incident takes place and is covered up in the season 1 finale of Succession.

Pomori≈°je (Serbian Cyrillic: –ü–æ–º–æ—Ä–∏—à—ò–µ) is a historical geographical region on the banks of the river Mure≈ü that in the past has had a sizable ethnic Serb population. The region is mostly divided between Romania and Hungary, with small part of it in northern Serbia. Today, a Serb minority is present in parts of the region that are part of Romania and Hungary. Geography Pomori≈°je does not have exactly defined geographical borders and term generally defines areas near the river Mure»ô. Different definitions would provide different views of how far from the Mure»ô Pomori≈°je might extend. Sometimes, term could refer to areas on the both banks of the Mure»ô (including northern parts of Banat along the southern bank of Mure»ô and southern parts of Cri»ôana along the northern bank of Mure»ô), while sometimes it can historically define only northern bank of the Mure»ô, therefore, excluding areas that are parts of the Banat. The region is mostly situated in what is now Arad County of Romania, and the smaller parts of it are situated in the Timi»ô County of Romania and Csongr√°d County of Hungary. In its wider meaning, it also include Szeged (in the Csongr√°d County of Hungary) and Novi Kne≈æevac (in the North Banat District of Serbia), although these areas are rather seen as part of Potisje instead of Pomori≈°je. Name The name Pomori≈°je means \\"a land near the river Mure»ô\\" in Serbian. Similar names such as Potisje, Podunavlje, Posavina, etc. are used in Serbian as a designation for areas near rivers (Tisa, Danube and Sava, respectively). Today, most of this region is not home to a significant ethnic Serb population, thus the name Pomori≈°je is rarely used; however, the Serb communities still inhabit both the Hungarian and Romanian part of Pomori≈°je, as well as the wider area of Pomori≈°je that includes Novi Kne≈æevac municipality in Serbia (nevertheless, since the latter municipality is currently not directly connected to the Mure»ô river, inhabitants of this area are generally viewed as living in Potisje -- that is, near the river Tisa; Novi Kne≈æevac municipality was connected to the Mure»ô before 1919-1920, when current state borders were defined). In the Hungarian part of Pomori≈°je, relatively large Serb communities live in the villages of Deszk, Sz≈ëreg, etc. History Military Frontier in Pomori≈°je in 1745 Ethnic territory of the Serbs in Pomori≈°je between 16th and 18th century (according to Jovan Cvijiƒá and Dr Du≈°an J. Popoviƒá) Historically, the population of Pomori≈°je was mostly composed of Romanians, Serbs and Hungarians. A large Serb population in this region had existed since the 16th century. During the Ottoman rule (16th-17th century), the region belonged to the Province of Teme≈üvar. After the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), northern Pomori≈°je belonged to the Habsburg Monarchy, and, between 1702 and 1751, it was part of the Tisa-Mure»ô (Potisje-Pomori≈°je) section of the Habsburg Military Frontier. During this period, the Serb population in the region was still significant. In 1720, the population of Arad, the main city of the region, numbered 177 Romanian, 162 Serbian, and 35 Hungarian families. Other important cities in Pomori≈°je were Lipova, Mak√≥, and Szeged. Roughly, the area between Szeged and Arad was mainly populated by Serbs, while area in the east of Arad mainly by Romanians. In 1720, the population of Szeged numbered 193 houses, of which 99 were Serbian. Remainder of Pomori≈°je was passed from Ottomans to Austrians after Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718. After the Tisa-Mure»ô section of the Military Frontier was abolished, many Serbs from Pomori≈°je and Potisje left these regions and immigrated to the Russian Empire (notably to Nova Serbia and Slavo-Serbia) in 1752. The main leaders of this migration were Jovan Albanez and Jovan ≈†eviƒá. In their place, Hungarians, Swabians, Slovaks and Romanians settled in the region. According to the 1910 census in Austria-Hungary, the population of Pomori≈°je (roughly including municipalities connected to the Mure»ô river, together with Szeged and Novi Kne≈æevac) was 670,726 people, of whom 33,355 were ethnic Serbs. The southern part of Pomori≈°je (including the municipalities of northern Banat, together with Novi Kne≈æevac) had a population of 245,276 people, of whom 29,175 were ethnic Serbs, while the northern part (including Szeged) had a population of 425,450 people, of whom 4,180 were ethnic Serbs.

The college traces its origins to 1856 when banker, philanthropist, and communal leader Hyman Gratz and the Hebrew Education Society of Philadelphia (established in 1849 by Rebecca Gratz and Isaac Leeser) joined together to establish a trust to create a Hebrew teachers college. Gratz is a private liberal arts college located in a suburban setting and is primarily a commuter campus with online courses. In addition to its undergraduate, graduate certificate, master's, and doctoral programs, Gratz also runs cultural programs, adult education offerings, a Jewish Community High School, and the Tuttleman Library for Jewish studies. Gratz also operates distance learning programs, including the first online Master of Arts in Holocaust and Genocide Studies. In addition, Gratz College is \\"the only institution in the United States to offer an actual Doctor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies degree, as opposed to a Ph.D. in a related discipline, like history or sociology.\\" The newly available doctorate is the first-ever online Ph.D. in Holocaust and Genocide Studies. History In 1856, Hyman Gratz signed a Deed of Trust to create a college after his death if various heirs died without children. The trust provided for \\"the establishment and support of a college for the education of Jews residing in the city and county of Philadelphia‚Äù. Hyman Gratz died on January 27, 1857, at age 81, and on October 15, 1893 the last heir named in the will died without any children. Thus the Gratz estate became available to create the college. On March 20, 1895, the trustees responsible for creating the college received slightly over $105,000 from the trust to create the college. The college was officially founded in February, 1895. Starting in October 1895, the college sponsored various lectures and other educational programs. Early Academic History In 1897, under the leadership of Board President, Moses A. Dropsie, Gratz College hired the first three faculty members: Henry M. Speaker (Principal, Jewish Literature), Arthur A. Dembitz (Jewish History), Isaac Husik (Hebrew Language). Classes officially began in January, 1898. Henry M. Speaker was an 1894 graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America where he studied Jewish Education. Isaac Husik, while teaching at Gratz, received his Ph.D. in Philosophy from University of Pennsylvania in 1902. He remained on the Gratz faculty until 1916 when he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania. Arthur Dembitz was the first cousin of Louis Dembitz Brandeis who at the time was one of the leading Jewish attorneys in the United States and in 1916 became the first Jew to serve on the US Supreme Court. Following the model of the early Jewish educator, Rebecca Gratz (Hyman's sister), the first classes at Gratz College were focused on the training of teachers. Women were accepted and educated on the same basis as men. There were eight women and five men in the first 'afternoon' class and the first evening class had twelve women and nine men. Women were inspired to gain training and enrolled in Gratz to become teachers of various aspects of Jewish culture, literature, history and language. Academics=Graduate programs Gratz College has two doctoral programs: Doctor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies (Ph.D.) and Doctor of Education in Leadership (Ed.D.). Gratz master's degree (MA and MS) programs include: Master of Arts in Education (MAEd), Master of Arts in Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Master of Arts in Jewish Professional Studies, Master of Arts in Jewish Communal Service, Master of Arts in Jewish Studies, and Master of Science in Nonprofit Management. In 2018, Gratz initiated a new program, a Master of Arts in Interfaith Leadership, and in 2019 the school initiated an Master of Science in Camp Administration and Leadership. Undergraduate programs Gratz offers undergraduate degree programs in Jewish Professional Studies and Jewish Studies. In addition, an undergraduate certificate in Jewish Education is offered as a starting point or boost to those already in Jewish educational settings and an Early Childhood Director Credential Certificate. Graduate Certificate Programs In addition to their full degree programs, Gratz offers Graduate Certificate Programs in Education, Master's Plus in Distinguished Teaching and Learning (Education), Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Jewish Nonprofit Management, Jewish Studies, Jewish Communal Service, and Nonprofit Management. Adult Continuing Education Professional Development courses for educators (CEU) and Continuing Legal Education (CLE) opportunities are offered every year to surrounding area professionals. In addition, the local community is offered 'Lunch and Learn', an educational speaker series held monthly. Organization and Administration Gratz College is a not-for-profit educational institution governed by a 31-member Board of Governors. The current chair is Rabbi Lance J. Sussman, Ph.D., the immediate past chair is Michelle Portnoff, J.D.. Historically, most members of the Board of Governors lived in greater Philadelphia, however the current board also has members in Georgia, Florida, Maryland and British Columbia. The current president of Gratz College is Paul Finkelman, Ph.D who took office in November, 2017. Accreditation Gratz is regionally accredited through the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Gratz was first accredited in 1967 and in 2019 was reaccredited. .

He achieved fame throughout the country for being the first of the daimyo to convert to Christianity following the arrival of the Jesuit missionaries in the mid-16th century. Following his baptism, he became known as \\"Dom Bartolomeu\\". Sumitada is also known as the lord who opened the port of Nagasaki to foreign trade.  Early life  ≈åmura Sumitada was born in 1533, the son of Arima Haruzumi, lord of Shimabara, and his wife, who was a daughter of ≈åmura Sumiyoshi. His childhood name was Sh≈çd≈çmaru ÂãùÁ´•‰∏∏. At age 5, he was adopted by his uncle ≈åmura Sumisaki, and succeeded to the ≈åmura family headship in 1550. As Sumisaki had no legitimate heirs, and the ≈åmura clan had its origins in the family line of the Arima, Sumisaki readily adopted the young Shodomaru, who took the name Sumitada at the time of his succession.  Career  Following his succession, he was immediately faced with a multitude of pressures, the greatest of which was the attack from Ry≈´z≈çji Takanobu of Hizen-Saga. Sumitada found the answer to his problems in the form of Christianity. In 1561, following the murder of foreigners in Hirado (in the area of influence of the Matsura clan), the Portuguese began to look for other ports where they could trade. In response to their search, Sumitada offered them safe haven in his domain, at Yokoseura. This cast a great impression on the Portuguese, and particularly on the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). This they readily agreed to, and soon after, in 1563, Sumitada and his retainers became Christian, and Sumitada took the baptismal name Bartolomeu. However, Sumitada was radical in his faith, razing Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, defacing his ancestors' graves, and because he forced Christianity on his retainers and the people of his domain, he ran the serious risk of a general uprising. There is also a view that Sumitada pursued Christianity mainly to profit from Portuguese technology and weapons. To illustrate Sumitada's devotion to Christianity, the Portuguese Jesuit father Lu√≠s Fr√≥is had once wrote: from The Samurai Sourcebook  Opening Nagasaki  Goto Takaakira, an illegitimate son of ≈åmura Sumisaki who hated Sumitada, led an uprising against him. During the chaos, Yokoseura was burned, ending the foreign trade there. As a result, in 1570, Sumitada opened the port of Nagasaki to the Portuguese and sponsored its development. When the Ry≈´z≈çji attacked Nagasaki in 1578, the Portuguese assisted Sumitada in repulsing them. Following this event, on June 9, 1580 Sumitada ceded Nagasaki \\"in perpetuity\\" to the Society of Jesus. Following Toyotomi Hideyoshi's campaign against the Shimazu clan, the ≈åmura were confirmed in their holdings, though Nagasaki was taken from the Jesuits and made into a chokkatsu-ryo, or direct landholding, of the Toyotomi administration.  Later life  Sumitada handed over domainal administration to his son Omura Yoshiaki and retired, living in a mansion at Sakaguchi. He died there of tuberculosis, on June 23, 1587.

Typical components include a water source, a centrifugal pump, foam concentrate tanks, a direct-injection foam proportioning system on the discharge side of the pump, a mixing chamber or device, a rotary air compressor, and control systems to ensure the correct mixes of concentrate, water, and air. Description A CAFS tanker of the Australian Capital Territory Fire Brigade A compressed air foam system is defined as a standard water pumping system that has an entry point where compressed air can be added to a foam solution to generate foam. The air compressor also provides energy, which, gallon for gallon, propels compressed air foam farther than aspirated or standard water nozzles. It is proven that CAFS attacks all three sides of the fire triangle simultaneously. The foam blankets the fuel, thereby reducing the fuel‚Äôs capacity to seek out a source of oxygen. The CAFS solution adheres to ceilings and walls, more readily aiding in rapid reduction in heat. Also, the opaque surfaces of the foam, as it adheres to walls and ceilings, shield the fuel source from radiant energy. (Brooks, 2005; Brooks, 2006) - Later disproven in NIST Study, see below. CAFS may also refer to any pressurized water style extinguisher that is charged with foam and pressurized with compressed air. It has later been proven, that CAFS is no more effective at extinguishing fires than regular water and may actually be detrimental to interior attacks. It also had the habit of burning firefighters during offensive interior operations due to introducing air (part of the fire tetrahedron) and generating more steam when attempting to combat initial fires. Weinschenk, Craig, et al. ‚ÄúExamination of Compressed Air Foam (CAF) for Interior Fire Fighting .‚Äù NIST Technical Note 1927, NIST, Jan. 2017, nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1927.pdf. History The idea that water is not a perfect tool for fire extinguishment has been long noted, as by W. E. Clark (1991), \\"The process of extinguishing fire by water is cumbersome and generally costly ‚Ä¶ the cost of installing water mains large enough for required flow, the installation and maintenance of fire hydrants, and the acquisition and maintenance of fire department pumpers, fire hose, and nozzles, make water a fairly expensive extinguishing agent ‚Ä¶ the use of water is hardly the ideal way to extinguish fire ‚Ä¶ there must be a better method waiting to be discovered.\\" (p. 75) Liebson (1996) adds, \\"Water is an inefficient extinguishing agent. It requires the use of large quantities at costs both financial and physical. These costs are imposed on the firefighter and the community.\\" (p. 5) The use of foam additives to water for extinguishment dates back to an English patent in 1877 for a method to produce chemical foam (Liebson, 1991, p. xi). The Royal Navy experimented with agents foamed by means of compressed air in the 1930s (Darley, 1994) and the United States Navy was using compressed air foam systems (CAFS) in the 1940s for flammable liquid fires. By the 1960s do-it-yourself car washes were using CAFS with low pressure and small-diameter hoses and nozzles, which flowed about per minute of solution and per minute of compressed air, with a nozzle reach of about (Rochna and Schlobohm, 1992). In the mid 1970s Mark Cummins, while working for the Texas Forest Service, developed a water expansion system known as the Texas Snow Job. Mr. Cummins invented the CAFS and was issued the US Patent 4318443 in 1982. This pioneering Class A CAFS used dish-washing detergents or a pine soap derivative, which was readily available as waste from local paper manufacturing industries, as a foaming agent mixed as 8 to 9 parts agent to 91 to 92 parts water, flowing up to per minute. The duration was limited by the use of compressed air cylinders rather than compressors (The US and foreign patent issued to Mark Cummins also included all types of air compressors and inert gas generators). By the mid-1980s, research by the United States Bureau of Land Management in co-operation with Mark Cummins, led to modern design features of rotary air compressors, centrifugal pumps, and direct-injection foam-proportioning systems (Fornell, 1991; IFSTA, 1966). CAFS received national attention in 1988 during the Yellowstone Park wildfires when the four-story Old Faithful Inn was successfully protected by blanketing it with compressed air foam (Darley, 1994). In the spring of 1994, a compressed air foam demonstration vehicle manufactured by W.S. Darley & Co., was driven from coast to coast in North America by Troy Carothers. The purpose was to spread the word about CAFS and display this relatively new technology to United States and Canadian firefighting services. Many years earlier Darley Co. teamed up with Cummins on the WEPS (water expansion pumping system) demonstration vehicle. The 1994 Darley demo vehicle was operated by Troy Carothers who was involved with the initial design and assembly of the Darley AutoCAFS product. Carothers is now the Darley AutoCAFS Manager and oversees all aspects of CAFS development for Darley Co. This demonstration vehicle concept has continued annually since 1994. Foam types CAFS is able to deliver a range of useful foam consistencies, labeled from type 1 (very dry) to type 5 (wet), which are controlled by the air-to-solution ratio, and, to a lesser extent, by the concentrate-to-water percentage. Type 1 and 2 foams have long drain times, meaning the bubbles do not burst and give up their water quickly, and long duration. Wet foams, such as type 4 and 5, drain more quickly in the presence of heat. A major advantage of using CAFS is having the unique ability to produce a wide range of foam qualities or foam types to provide the most appropriate foam response to individual fire situations. This gives the fire officer the advantage of custom tailoring the best foam type for the tactical use and fire problem at hand.. After testing a dry type 2 foam in several situations, Johnny Murdock notes, \\"The emerging consensus is that the dryer foams (type II; maybe type I) should be used to suppress vapors, protect unburned structures, build wildland fire lines involving unburned fuels; ‚Ä¶ and that structural fire suppression requires a wetter foam (type IV or type V); and that both structural and wildland overhaul require type V foam.\\" For structural firefighting with compressed air foam, Dominic Colletti recommends utilizing a per minute to per minute \\"air to foam solution\\" ratio, with a 0.5% class A foam proportioning rate. This would produce flow rates from a typical 1-3/4\\" inch hose of per minute of foam solution and per minute of compressed air. This air to foam solution ratio produces a wet, quick draining finished foam that will quickly knockdown flame and reduce fire compartment temperature. This ratio also allows for a higher relative foam solution (liquid) flow rate to help maintain the highest levels of firefighter safety possible. (The Compressed Air Foam Systems Handbook, Colletti 2005.) While Colletti's claims for flows are not agreed upon by many industry experts, as exhibited at the CAFS symposium held in Rosenberg, Texas in February 2007. A panel there agreed that flows of per minute foam solution in tandem with per minute air produce the most effective blanket. It was further agreed that the maximum combination of air flow mixed with foam solution flow out of a 1-3/4\\" line under normal pump pressures of 100‚Äì125 PSI could not physically exceed a total of 140‚Äì150. In other words, the simultaneous flow of per minute of air and per minute of water is approaching the maximum limit or carrying capacity of that diameter hose (1.75 inches). (Texas CAFS Symposium February, 2007) Water can conversion Air pressurized water (APW) fire extinguishers are commonly converted into makeshift CAFS extinguishers by drilling two 1/8-1/16 inch holes in the pickup tube above the water line. The unit is then filled with of water and class A foam, AFFF, FFFP or commercial detergent is added to the water in a 1% ratio for class A fires and a 3%-6% ratio for class B fires. Typically, the tip of the smooth-bore application nozzle is then cut off to allow the foam to properly expand. Keeping the nozzle will result in wetter foam but longer range. Cutting the nozzle will result in an expanded, dry foam but will lack the range of the standard water nozzle. CAFS extinguishers can also be fitted with air aspirators, commonly used on AFFF and FFFP foam extinguishers, which will result in a more expanded foam but will lack the heat resistance of non- aspirated foam, which does not break the bubbles. Problems On 17 December 2005 two firefighters from T√ºbingen, Germany, died inside a burning building when one of the hoses inside the building burst and they were left without extinguishing agent. In the following reconstruction of the tragedy, experts were surprised to find out that CAFS filled hoses are more likely to burst under heat because the foam is unable to cool the hoses sufficiently. Some fire district engines have experienced that CAFS filled hoses have a higher incidence of clogging and decrease in pressure.

It was founded in 1930 and led until his death in 1935 by Syrian-born Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam,Strike Terror: The Story of Fatah, Ehud Yaari, Sabra Books, 1970, p.41-42 whose preaching was instrumental in laying the foundations for the formation of the Black Hand, which he used to proclaim jihad and attack Jewish settlers.Baruch Kimmerling, Joel S. Migdal, The Palestinian People: A History,Harvard University Press, 2003 p.65. The idea for such a group appeared to crystallize after the 1929 riots, though one source says a decision was taken after the Day of Atonement incitement at the Wailing Wall in September 1928. From the outset a split occurred in the organization, with one militant group led by Abu Ibrahim arguing for immediate militant attacks, while the other headed by al-Qassam thought an armed revolt premature, and risked exposing the group's preparations. According to Subhi Yasin, the militant attacks in the north were executed by the dissident group in defiance of Qassam, though in 1969 Abu Ibrahim denied these allegations. The ensuing militant campaign began with the ambush and murder of three members of Kibbutz Yagur, 11 April 1931, a failed bombing attack on outlying Jewish homes in Haifa, in early 1932, and several operations that killed or wounded some four members of northern Jewish settlements. It climaxed with the deaths of a Jewish father and son in Nahalal, from a bomb thrown into their home, on 22 December 1932.:Lachman, on the basis of evidence amassed by contemporary Jewish investigations, propends for Abu Ibrahim's version. After the failure of the 1921 Syrian revolt that he led, al-Qassam escaped to Haifa. According to Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often cooperated with Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammad Amin al- Husayni. They were on good terms, and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, in which one source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell out in the mid-thirties, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line of activism.. When the Mufti rejected his plans to divert funding marked for mosque repairs for the purchase of weaponry, Qassam found support in the Arab Nationalist Istiqlal Party. Qassam continued his attempts to forge an alliance with the Mufti in order to attack the British. He was not successful for the Mufti, who headed the Supreme Muslim Council, was still committed to a diplomatic approach at the time. Qassam went ahead with his plans to attack the British on his own. The Black Hand was preceded by a group calling itself Green Hand that existed briefly in Safad and Acre districts and which was active for a few months during the winter of 1929/1930. Al-Qassam justified violence on religious grounds. After the 1929 Hebron massacre, he intensified his anti-Zionist and anti-British agitation and obtained a fatwa from Sheikh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the Mufti of Damascus, authorizing the armed resistance against the British and the Jews. Operations By 1935, Black Hand had several hundred men - the figures differ from 200 to 800 - organised in cells of 5 men, and arranged military training for peasants.Beverly Milton-Edwards, Islamic Politics in Palestine, p.18. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they used to raid Jewish settlements and sabotage British-constructed rail lines. Though striking a responsive chord among the rural poor and urban underclass, his movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities.Baruch Kimmerling, Joel S. Migdal, The Palestinian People: A History, p.66. In various acts of violence Black Hand targeted Jewish targets in northern Palestine between 1930 and 1935 and killed at least eight Jews. In one instance three members of kibbutz Yagur were killed, 11 April 1931,Kayyali, Abdul-Wahhab Said (no date) Palestine. A Modern History Croom Helm. . p.164 and in another a father and son were killed in Nahalal, 22 December 1932. On November 20, 1935, after killing a Palestine police officer, al-Qassam was surrounded by British police in a cave near Jenin and killed in a gunbattle along with three of his fighters. Some of the Black Hand's surviving members participated in the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine.War, Peace and Terror in the Middle East, Raphael Israeli, Routledge, 2003, p.7 Legacy Although al-Qassam's revolt was unsuccessful in his lifetime, many organizations gained inspiration from his revolutionary example. He became a popular hero and an inspiration to later Arab militants, who in the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt, called themselves Qassamiyun, followers of al-Qassam. Black Hand was the name used by members of the 'Azazme Negev Bedouin who were believed to be responsible for the killing of eleven Israelis at Scorpion Pass, 17 March 1954. Another account describes another group using the Black Hand name which was active around Jaffa in 1919. According to this account it was founded by Wadi'al Bustani and was believed to have the support of the British military governor of Jaffa.Cohen, Aharon (1970) Israel and the Arab World. W.H.

Founded in 1987, it is part of the Moreno Valley Unified School District. In both 1988 & 1994 Canyon Springs High School won the CIF-SS Football Championship. In 1994 the football team was voted as State Champions for Division 2. It also won the IE league championships in 2006 for Cross Country. Canyon Springs Wrestling has also won fixed CIF tournament titles (1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 2002) and 3 CIF dual meet titles (1993, 1994, and 2002). Canyon Springs won the 2008 IEC Championship sophomore title. Canyon Springs High School was the only High School in the district to not have a stadium. In June 2017, Canyon Springs was approved to build a new sports complex that will include a brand new football stadium, tennis courts, and improved softball, baseball, and soccer facilities. In June 2018, The Canyon Springs Sports Complex was completed and just in time for the Class of 2017-2018 Graduation. In early 2019, The Moreno Valley Unified School district began to prepare plans to modernize the facilities at Canyon Springs. This modernization would be a step in the Measure M plan. The modernization is separated into four Phases. Phase I of the modernization plan includes a 2-Story Classroom building with 8 Science Classrooms and 16 standard classrooms. A new Multipurpose room is also being added to Canyon Springs as the campus does not have a multi-purpose room. The multi-purpose room will include a replacement kitchen and a new music room for the music program. Phase II also includes new solar panels in the parking lots for anyone at Canyon Springs. Phase II includes the modernization of the Administration building, as well as the classrooms in Building A. Phase III includes the modernization of the Cougar Canyon Gymnasium as well as existing classrooms and science labs on the facility. Phase IV includes the modernization of the library as well as the removal of portables. It is expected that the Canyon Springs modernization will be completed by late 2022 or early 2023. Canyon Springs offers a variety of programs. Some of the most notable programs at Canyon Springs includes: Canyon Springs Business Academy, Health Academy, Academy of Creative Technology (ACT), JROTC, Cyberpatriot, AVID, Career Technical Education, Canyon Springs Band and Pageantry, Canyon Springs Choir and the International Baccalaureate Program (IB). Canyon Springs also had a variety of different clubs ranging from Ballet Folkl√≥rico to Associated Student Body (ASB). Canyon Springs also included a Sports Program. Sports include: Football, Volleyball, Tennis, Soccer, Water Polo, Basketball, Cheer, Swimming, Baseball, Track, and Wrestling. The Canyon Springs Football Team has been in decline for the last few years following defeat after defeat. Fortunately, The Sports Program has been improving each year as they are slowly bringing Victory to Canyon Springs High.

It used to serve as the seat of local government until 1939, and now houses a museum. The town hall was originally built in the late 13th century following the founding of the medieval city in 1253; it was rebuilt in roughly its present-day form, in mannerist style, with an ornate loggia, by Giovanni Battista di Quadro in 1550-1560\\\\. The display of mechanical fighting goats, played out daily at noon above the clock on the front wall of the building, is one of the city's main tourist attractions. History The town hall was originally constructed as the administrative building of the city founded on the left bank of the Warta in 1253 (see History of Pozna≈Ñ). It was completed around 1300, during the reign of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, and was first documented in Latin in 1310 as Domus Consulum.\\"Town Hall\\" Pozna≈Ñ Tourism, undated, retrieved on 2008-06-11. It was a one-storey Gothic building built upon a raised quadrangle. The cellars remain from this period of construction. The building was extended in the 15th century, and at the turn of the century a tower was built at the north-western corner. The interior was remodeled between 1504 and 1508. Town Hall about 1910, during the German rule In 1536 the city suffered a major fire, which did serious damage to the town hall. Repair work was carried out in 1540‚Äì1542, particularly to the tower, but it remained unsafe. In 1550 the city' council commissioned Giovanni Battista di Quadro to carry out a major rebuilding. The work lasted until 1560. Di Quadro added an upper storey, extended the building towards the west, and added attic walls and a three- storey loggia. A new clock (installed 1551) was made with three full faces and one half-face, and with goats added as a \\"comic element\\" (see next section). In 1675 the tower, clock and goats were destroyed by lightning. The tower was rebuilt in 1690 to a height of . The top of the tower was destroyed in a hurricane of 1725. In 1781-1784 major renovation was carried out on the building thanks to the efforts of the city's \\"Committee of Good Order\\", and it obtained the basic form which it presents today. A Classical-style tower roof was designed by Bonawentura Solari, and on the top was a white eagle with a two-metre wing span. On the eastern elevation Franciszek Cielecki painted Jagiellonian kings, and under the central turret was placed a cartouche with the king's initials \\"SAR\\" (Stanislaus Augustus Rex). The next major renovation was carried out in 1910-1913 (during the period of German rule), when black rustication was used to give the building a more \\"northern German\\" style. The original late renaissance polychromy was destroyed. An additional storey was addedwww.poznan.pl and the goats, which had been absent since 1675, were restored to the tower in 1913. In October 1943 the Town Hall was the scene of Heinrich Himmler's Posen speeches. Following major damage in the Battle of Pozna≈Ñ (1945), the Town Hall was again rebuilt in 1945-1954, when the Renaissance character of the elevations was restored (and extracts from the constitution of the Polish People's Republic were added to the text displayed on the attic wall). The eagle, which had been kept hidden during the war, was returned to the tower in 1947. The mechanism that drives the goats was replaced in 1954, and again at the end of the century. Renovation carried out in 1992-2002 largely restored the building to its post-1784 appearance. The goats and bugle call The mechanized goats, which butt heads daily at noon Today the mechanical goats' butting display is performed daily at noon, preceded by the striking of the clock and the playing of a traditional bugle call (hejna≈Ç). At other hours between 7 am and 9 pm the same call is played on a carillon, installed in the tower in 2003. The daily appearance of the goats is one of Pozna≈Ñ's best-known tourist attractions. Pozna≈Ñ bugle call A legend behind the original addition of the goats to the clock mechanism states that a cook, while preparing a banquet for the voivode and other dignitaries, had burnt a roast deer, and attempted to replace it by stealing two goats from a nearby meadow. The goats escaped and ran up the town hall tower, where they attracted the attention of the townspeople when they began to butt each other (according to some versions, this drew attention to a fire which might otherwise have done significant damage). Because of the entertainment provided, the voivode pardoned both the cook and the goats, and ordered that two mechanical goats be incorporated into the new clock being made for the building. Kozio≈Çki in the Museum of History of Pozna≈Ñ City Another legend is associated with the hejna≈Ç. This says that Bolko, son of the tower's trumpeter, once took care of a crow whose wing had been shot through. The boy was then awoken at night by a gnome wearing a crown and purple cape, who thanked the boy for his kindness and handed him a small gold trumpet, telling him to blow it when in danger. After these words the gnome transformed into a crow and flew away. Years later, after Bolko had taken his father's place as trumpeter, when an attacking army was scaling Pozna≈Ñ's walls, Bolko remembered the present, ran to the top of the tower and began to play the trumpet. Dark clouds began to gather on the horizon, which turned out to be an enormous flock of crows that fell upon the attacking army and forced it to retreat. The trumpet was lost when Bolko dropped it in his astonishment, but the call which he played is still performed. Rooms The interior of the town hall consists of cellars, a ground floor and two upper storeys. The building currently serves as a Museum of the History of the City of Pozna≈Ñ (Muzeum Historii Miasta Poznania), a subdivision of the National Museum in Pozna≈Ñ. Cellars and ground floor The cellars were built between the 13th and 14th centuries. There was originally one large room with a supporting column in the centre; this was later divided into four rooms. Keystones feature the coat of arms of Pozna≈Ñ (crossed keys) and the Bohemian coat of arms (white lion with double tail) dating from the times of Wac≈Çaw II Czeski. Until the 17th century the cellars were used to store goods, and in the 17th and 18th centuries they contained a prison and torture chamber. In the 19th century they were in use as a restaurant. They were later used as museum rooms, and are currently being renovated. The ground-floor rooms were originally built in Gothic style, but rebuilt in Renaissance style by G. B. di Quadro; only one room retains the original vault. The architect also added two rooms with lunette vaults. One of the original uses of these rooms was for the town archives.  Upper floors  The second floor of the building was originally used for utility functions; following World War II damage it was rebuilt as exhibition space, with ceilings modelled on those from the houses on the Old Market Square. However the first floor contained the grandest rooms, used for official purposes by the city's authorities - these include the Great Hall (Vestibule), the Royal Hall and the Courtroom, described below. = Great Hall = Renaissance stucco decorations in the Great Hall The Great Hall or Vestibule is designed in Renaissance style by G. B. di Quadro. It was originally used for important sittings of the city court. Over the entrance is a quotation from Aristotle's Politics, and on the hall side a quotation from the Third Psalm. The hall retains its original vaults with lunettes, supported by two columns and by corbels. The coffers and columns are ornamented (the ornamentation on the ceiling is sgraffito). The coffers in the northern part of the room have polychrome stucco decoration showing Hercules and Samson, David and Goliath, and Marcus Curtius. The lower coffers show the coats of arms of Poland, Lithuania, the House of Sforza (Bona Sforza was Polish queen consort to 1548), the Habsburgs (Catherine Habsburg was queen consort from 1553) and Pozna≈Ñ, as well as an angel holding a board with the date 1555, the year the work was completed. Artists' signatures, house marks and representations of their tools can also be found. The southern part contains representations of animals and legendary creatures (elephant, lion, leopard, aegle, rhinoceros, griffin, Pegasus) and deities signifying heavenly bodies (the sun, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn in the Ptolemeic system. Also in cross-shaped coffers are the heads of Moses and of Christ, the latter accompanied by another house mark. On the western wall are two portals dating from 1508, which combine Gothic and Renaissance features. Gold-plated doors contain the Bohemian coat of arms, possibly dating from the time of Wac≈Çaw II Czeski. Notable exhibits include a Venetian globe (1688), and busts of Roman emperors from the 3rd and 4th centuries, excavated in Italy in the 18th century. The hall is currently used for concerts and for special weddings. = Royal Hall = The Royal Hall (Sala Kr√≥lewska) was once richly decorated similarly to the Great Hall, and was used for meetings of the city council. It was partly restored in 1954 following war damage. Its name derives from the portraits of kings which once decorated the hall (the portraits on display today come from the National Museum's collections). The hall features a Renaissance sandstone fireplace (1541), moved here from the adjoining weighing house when that building was demolished in 1890 (it was rebuilt in its original style after World War II). There is also a portal dating from 1536, moved from a house on the Old Market Square (Stary Rynek 87). = Courtroom = The sala sƒÖdowa (courtroom) was used for minor court hearings. It retains Renaissance \\"mirror vaults\\", with polychrome decoration dating from between the late 16th and early 19th centuries. On the northern wall are personifications of four continents. On the wall to the right of the entrance is the painting Aeropagus Maioris Poloniae by Wac≈Çaw Graff, which alludes to a court of 1726. Opposite the entrance is a marble statue of king Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus, dating from 1783. External features View of the building from the north-east The front of the building, facing east, features an ornately decorated, three-storey loggia. Between the arcade columns on the ground floor are five pairs of female figures, the first four pairs representing virtues: patience (paciencia), with a lamb and prudence (prudencia) with a mirror; charity (charitas) with two children and justice (iusticia) with scales and a sword; faith (fides) with a chalice and sword and hope (spes) with a thurible and the sun; and courage (fortitudo) with a broken column and temperance (temperancia) pouring water from a vase into a bowl. The last pair is of two famous women from the Ancient World: Lucretia (Lucrecia) with a spear through her own breast, and Cleopatra (Cleapairi), with snakes twisted around her arms. Between the ground and first floors runs a fresco in Latin text serving as a warning to judges. Below the first floor there is a series of medallions with figures from the Ancient World: the brothers Gaius Gracchus and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, Lucius Junius Brutus, Archimedes, Vitruvius, Virgil, Homer, Justinian I, Horace, Spartacus, and the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogeiton. Above the loggia is an attic wall, which features a list of rulers of the Jagiellonian Dynasty from W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço and Jadwiga of Poland to Sigismund II Augustus.

Before and after image manipulation IAF F-16 deploying a single flare over Southern Lebanon; the flare was digitally duplicated to make it appear that several missiles were being fired. The Adnan Hajj photographs controversy (also called Reutersgate) involves digitally manipulated photographs taken by Adnan Hajj, a Lebanese freelance photographer based in the Middle East, who had worked for Reuters over a period of more than ten years. Hajj's photographs were presented as part of Reuters' news coverage of the 2006 Lebanon War, but Reuters has admitted that at least two were significantly altered before being published. Timeline The first image was discovered on August 5, 2006 when blogger Charles Johnson of Little Green Footballs wrote that the first image \\"shows blatant evidence of manipulation\\" (Adobe Photoshop clone stamp), Reuters removed all of Hajj's photographs from their site; Hajj claimed to not have intentionally altered the photo but was trying to remove \\"dust marks\\". Reuters did not stand by the photographer and admitted that Hajj had altered it, saying \\"photo editing software was improperly used on this image. A corrected version will immediately follow this advisory. We are sorry for any inconvenience.\\" Head of PR Moira Whittle said: \\"Reuters takes such matters extremely seriously as it is strictly against company editorial policy to alter pictures.\\" The second manipulated image was reported by the pseudonymous blogger \\"Dr. Rusty Shackleford\\" on his blog \\"The Jawa Report\\". Reuters captioned it as showing an Israeli F-16 fighter jet firing ground-attack missiles \\"during an air strike on Nabatiyeh\\", but the F-16 was actually deploying one defensive flare, and the original photograph showed only one flare.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HS4zAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=dAgGAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2021,2902823&dq;=jawa- report&hl;=en The photo had been doctored to increase the number of flares falling from the F-16 from one to three, and misidentified them as missiles. On August 6, Reuters announced it would stop all cooperation with Adnan Hajj. Hajj claimed he had just been trying to remove dust marks, and that he made mistakes due to the bad lighting conditions he was working under. Critics point out that this is impossible, as Hajj's doctored image added an entire plume of smoke, duplicated several buildings, and showed a repeating pattern indicating that one plume of smoke was \\"cloned\\" several times.Bad Photoshopping saves the day LAYOUT editor's blog, August 14, 2006 On August 7, Reuters decided to withdraw all 920 photos by Hajj from sale. As of May 11, 2008, Reuters had removed all of Hajj's images from its site. On January 18, 2007 Reuters reported that an internal investigation into the Adnan Hajj photomanipulation had led to a top Reuters photo editor being fired. The charges against Hajj took place within a larger context of many allegations about misleading photographs coming out of the Israel‚ÄìLebanon conflict; see 2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies.

The Herbarium is linked to the Western Australian 'Regional Herbaria Network' ‚Äì which links approximately 84 regional community groups which have local reference collections. In 2000, with the Wildflower Society of Western Australia and the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority it published The Western Australian Flora ‚Äì A Descriptive Catalogue. History The Herbarium was formed as the amalgamation of three separate government department herbaria: those of the Western Australian Museum, the Department of Agriculture, and the \\"forest herbarium\\" maintained by the Conservator of Forests. The first of these was formed by Bernard Henry Woodward, Director of the Museum and Art Gallery, probably around 1895; the second was probably formed with the appointment of Alexander Morrison as botanist to the Department of Agriculture in 1897. In 1906 the Department of Agriculture handed its herbarium over to the Museum, but reclaimed it in 1911. The \\"forest herbarium\\" commenced in 1916. Around 1928, the Government took the decision to amalgamate the three into a single State Herbarium, to be managed by the Department of Agriculture. The \\"forest herbarium\\" was handed over more or less immediately, but the Museum was opposed to the merger, and did not finally hand over its specimens until around 1959. In 1988 departmental responsibility was shifted from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Conservation and Land Management, the Department of Parks and Wildlife, and now the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.

It is set in a future post scarcity dystopian world in which everyone is considered an \\"ugly,\\" but then turned \\"Pretty\\" by extreme cosmetic surgery when they reach the age of 16. It tells the story of teenager Tally Youngblood who rebels against society's enforced conformity, after her friends Shay and David show her the downsides to becoming a \\"Pretty,\\" even though it is obvious to most people. Written for young adults, Uglies deals with themes of change, both emotional and physical. The book is the first installment in what was originally a trilogy, the Uglies series, which also includes the books Pretties, Specials, and Extras. In 2018, four new installments within the Uglies Universe were announced, to be titled the Imposters Series. Plot Three hundred years in the future, the government provides for everything, including plastic surgery operations. Everyone on their sixteenth birthday receives the ‚Äúpretty‚Äù operation which transforms them into the society's standard of beautiful.Westerfeld, p. 83 After the operation, new Pretties cross the river that divides the city and lead a new life with no responsibilities or obligations. There are two other operations available, one to transform Pretties into ‚ÄúMiddle-Pretties‚Äù (adults with a job), and another to transform Middle-Pretties into \\"Crumblies\\". Former cities have decayed after bacteria infected the world's petroleum, making it unstable. The old society, so dependent on oil, fell apart when cars and oil fields exploded and food could no longer be transported. People who lived before this catastrophe are called \\"Rusties.\\"http://scottwesterfeld.com/books/uglies/ Tally Youngblood is almost sixteen. Like every other Ugly, she awaits the operation with great anticipation. Her best friend, Peris, has already had the operation and, motivated by her desire to see him, Tally sneaks across the river to New Pretty Town. There she meets Shay, another Ugly. They become friends and Shay teaches Tally how to ride a hoverboard. Shay also mentions rebelling against the operation. At first, Tally ignores the idea, but is forced to deal with it when Shay runs away a few days before their shared sixteenth birthday, leaving behind cryptic directions to her destination, a ‚Äúrenegade settlement‚Äù called the Smoke, where city runaways go to escape the operation. On the day of Tally's operation, she is taken to Special Circumstances, a division that is likened to ‚Äúgremlins‚Äù and, ‚Äú[blamed] when anything weird happens.\\"Westerfeld, p. 120 Dr. Cable, a woman who is described as ‚Äúa cruel pretty‚Äù,Westerfeld, p. 191 is the head of Special Circumstances. She gives Tally an ultimatum to either help locate Shay and the Smoke, or never become a pretty. Tally cooperates and Dr. Cable gives her a hoverboard and all the needed supplies to survive in the wild, along with a heart locket that contains a tracking device. Once activated, it will show the location of the Smoke to Special Circumstances. Following Shay's clues, Tally sets off to find her friend. When Tally arrives at the Smoke, she finds Shay, her friend David and an entire community of runaway Uglies. She is reluctant to activate the pendant and it eventually becomes clear that David is in love with her. David takes her to meet his parents, Maddy and Az, who are the original runaways from the city. They explain how the operation does more than ‚Äúcosmetic nipping and tucking.‚Äù It also causes lesions in the brain to make the people placid, or ‚Äúpretty- minded.‚Äù Horrified, Tally decides to keep the Smoke secret and throws the locket into a fire to destroy it. However, the flames' heat causes the tracker to activate, giving away the Smoke's location. The following morning, Special Circumstances arrives at the camp and Tally makes an effort to escape. She does not succeed and is caught and taken to a rabbit pen, where other caught Smokies are kept, tied up. Eye scans are taken of all the captured Smokies, identifying from which city they fled. Tally is then taken to Dr. Cable, who explains how they found the Smoke. Because of how long it took to activate the pendant, Dr. Cable suspects that Tally betrayed her but activated it by accident. Dr. Cable tests Tally by ordering her to retrieve the locket, which should be intact. Tally escapes on a hoverboard. After a long and stressful chase, she manages to hide in a cave where they cannot track her heat signature. There she finds David also hiding and together, they begin to plan a rescue. Tally and David go back to his house, where they find evidence that Special Circumstances took Maddy and Az. David leads Tally to a secret stash of survival equipmentWesterfeld, p. 338 where they find everything they need, and load them onto the four hoverboards stashed there. As Tally and David travel back to the city to free their friends, they fall in love. Arriving at the Special Circumstances complex, they discover that Shay has already been ‚Äúturned‚Äù and is now a Pretty.Westerfeld, p. 364 After meeting Dr. Cable, David knocks her out and takes her work tablet, which contains all the necessary information to reverse the brain lesions created by the Pretty operation. Tally and David then free all the Smokies held in the complex. As they escape the complex, Maddy tells David that his father, Az, is dead. Once everyone is safe, Maddy begins working on a cure using Dr. Cable's tablet.Westerfeld, p. 388 She then offers it to Shay, who refuses, not wanting to become a ‚Äúvegetable.‚ÄùWesterfeld, p. 397 Since Tally feels responsible for her betrayal, she decides to become a Pretty and take the cure as a ‚Äúwilling subject‚Äù.Westerfeld, p. 395 To convince David to let her go back to the city, she tells him about her involvement with Special Circumstances and searching for the Smoke to betray them. While David is absorbing what Tally admitted, Maddy advises Tally to go back with Shay before she changes her mind. Once there, Tally announces to a Middle Pretty, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Tally Youngblood. Make me pretty,‚Äù the final phrase of the novel.Westerfeld, p. 406 Characters=Uglies *Tally Youngblood is the main character of the story. She is clever and loves tricks. Her Ugly nickname is Squint. As the story progresses, she begins to stray from the rules of her city, and her assignment. She falls in love with David at the Smoke. Together, Tally and David rescue the Smokies after the Smoke is captured by Special Circumstances. In the end, she gives herself up to be Pretty and help Shay. *Shay is Tally's new friend in Uglyville. She is an Ugly nicknamed Skinny. They meet while Tally is fleeing from New Pretty City. Shay teaches Tally how to hoverboard and more about the outside world and the Rusties. Shay prefers to refer to Tally by her name, however, they occasionally call each other by their Ugly nicknames to provoke each other. After a fight, Shay decides to \\"grow up\\" and go to the Smoke. Shay grows jealous of Tally's presence in the Smoke, especially of her relationship with David. Shay realizes Tally's ultimate betrayal, but no longer cares once she is made Pretty. Smokies *David, the son of the founders of the Smoke, was not born in any city. Shay has an interest in David but he does not reciprocate her feelings. After Tally arrives at the Smoke, his interest in her makes Shay jealous. David helps change Tally's feeling towards the cities. He wears hand-sewn clothing, made from animal skins, and has survival skills which he passes on to Tally. *Maddy is David's mother. She tells Tally about the brain lesions caused by the Pretty surgery, and later develops a cure for the lesions. She is a founder of the Smoke. *Az is David's father and dies in an operation. As part of the Pretty Special Committee, he discovered the brain lesions that the Pretty surgery causes and suspects the lesions are intentional. He is a founder of the Smoke. *Croy is another Smokie. He is originally from Uglyville and knows Shay. He is originally suspicious of Tally, but grows to trust her. *The Boss: Although he is called the \\"Boss\\", he is not in charge of the Smoke (Actually, no one is); however, he is in charge of the library. Died when the Specials arrive. Specials *Dr. Cable is the head of Special Circumstances, and the one who denies Tally the operation until she finds Shay. She sends Specials to destroy the Smoke. She is described as having an aquiline nose, non-reflective gray eyes, a razor-like voice, and sharp teeth. Pretties *Peris, Tally's best friend, is three months older than Tally and thus has become a Pretty. He helps Tally decide to betray Shay. His Ugly nickname was Nose. *Ellie Youngblood is Tally's mother who helps Tally decide to turn in Shay. She is a Middle Pretty. *Sol Youngblood is Tally's father who helps Tally decide to turn in Shay. He is a Middle Pretty. Major motifs=Identity According to critics, Uglies contains themes of identity, particularly regarding teenagers. Phillip Gough said the government of Tally's city, which controls what happens within the operation, ‚Äúremoves responsibility for identity, ‚Äù creating sameness and uniformity. By placing heavy emphasis on the role of individualism, the novel shows the importance of teen's self-concept. Because identity is formed by ‚Äúdisplacement,‚Äù and all citizens are carefully sheltered, there is no chance for them to branch out into independence. ‚ÄúPhysical identity is determined by committees,\\" noted Gough in his essay discussing Westerfeld's novel. Due to the lack of choice, all ‚Äúmarkers of physical identity‚Äù are destroyed by their government. Beauty Kristi N. Scott and M. Heather Dragoo note that another recurring theme in the ‚Äúimage-obsessed society,‚Äù is beauty, and its recurring relationship with individuality. Gough agreed, commenting that ‚Äúwhen everyone is equal, beauty loses its meaning‚Äù. Beauty went hand in hand with identity: Uglies were taught to think of their bodies and faces as ‚Äútemporary‚Äù, something that would be replaced later with cosmetic surgery. A strong line is drawn to connect features with personality, and one critic stated that the characters develop ‚Äúugly‚Äù and ‚Äúpretty‚Äù personalities with each stage of their operations. Dystopian society A ‚Äúutopia resting on ruthless suppression of individual freedom‚Äù was Amanda Craig of The Times's description of Tally's city. Many critics identified the trend of a controlling government in the novel. People in the protagonist's world are ‚Äúprogrammed and designed by the Pretty committee, ‚Äù with no say-so in their operation, and identity is placed firmly ‚Äúin the hands of the state‚Äù. Dragoo and Scott point out how segregated the city is, with Pretties, Uglies, Middlies, and Crumblies neatly divided into different sections. Many reviewers have commented on the way in which the city manipulates its inhabitants, including the supposedly rebellious uglies, who are nothing more than ‚Äúdocile bodies‚Äù. Bedies, the dystopian society depicted by Westerfeld includes a particularly common trope in the genre: the duality of spaces, the metropolis representing the totalitarian civilization and nature as a field for freedom. Humanity Various critics also found a theme of humanity within Uglies. Phillip Gough noted that Pretties and Specials (those who worked for Special Circumstances) are ‚Äúposthuman‚Äù because of their operations. Others, including Scott and Dragoo, argued against this, claiming ‚Äúthe human body provides an artistic and political canvas for intentional manipulation,\\" and that this physical transformation can be an ‚Äúoutlet for humanity‚Äù. The novel Uglies seems to take no definite stance on it, though clearer points are shown in Pretties and Specials, the following books in the trilogy. Background When asked how he came up with the idea of Uglies, Westerfeld said, \\"the inspiration came from a friend whose dentist asked him to consider getting cosmetic surgery.\\" He is the son of a computer programmer for Univac, which meant he grew up familiar with the cutting edge of 1960s technology. Amanda Craig said that \\"it is his prescient perception of how such inventions will lead to absolute loss of privacy which has elicited as much fan-mail as the issue of how looks dominate our lives.\\" The book shares many themes with the 1964 The Twilight Zone episode \\"Number 12 Looks Just Like You\\". The author of the books noted that he saw the episode in his childhood but had forgotten the details. In the dedication page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: ‚ÄúThis novel was shaped by a series of e-mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story ‚ÄúLiking What You See: A Documentary.‚Äù His input on the manuscript was also invaluable.‚Äù In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves. Reception The novel has received mostly positive reviews. The Baroque Body praised the novel as having ‚Äúcreative slang, unique technical gadgets, and defining characteristics of personhood.‚Äù Cory Doctorow complimented its ‚Äúperfect parables of adolescent life,‚Äù and stated that it is ‚Äúfine science fiction for youth.\\" Jennifer Mattson claimed it to be ‚Äúingenious. ‚Äù Reed Business Information praised the ‚Äúconvincing plot‚Äù and noted that it is ‚Äúhighly readable.‚Äù However, Publishers Weekly commented that Tally was a ‚Äúrather passive protagonist,‚Äù and the United Kingdom Times complained that ‚ÄúTally herself is a bit too vague as a character.‚Äù Critic Jennifer Mattson noted that the brisk pace of the novel as being ‚Äúbad for convincing relationships.‚Äù The novel sparked discussion over the use of plastic surgery to improve one's looks. The author said he has ‚Äúreceived many letters from girls who have decided against having surgery since reading Uglies,‚Äù while others, sparked by Uglies, have started to ponder the ethics of changing your body's appearance. Westerfeld has theorized that ‚Äúhaving extreme cosmetic surgery will be like buying a $1,000 Gucci bag, an indication that you are a member of the privileged class.\\" Critics echo his opinion. However, Westerfeld has also stated he ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt hesitate [to use plastic surgery] if he had a kid with port-wine stain. We have all been altering our appearances ever since clothing was invented.‚Äù Other critics have stated that while altering one's appearance with plastic surgery can be ethically debatable, the benefits of it to people who have need for it are tremendous. There is also some moderate debate sparked by Uglies over the issue of monitoring people. The state has started to track teens through their cell phones and on occasion through dental implants. Westerfeld feels that this will ‚Äúresult in a total loss of privacy,‚Äù however, others feel that this technology is necessary to properly supervise people. Adaptations=Film 20th Century Fox and producer John Davis (Eragon) bought the film rights to the novel in 2006. The movie was originally supposed to be released in 2011, according to the Internet Movie Database, but the release date was pushed back. In September 2020, it was announced that Netflix had acquired the rights for a movie based on Uglies. Joey King, who had previously worked with Netflix on The Kissing Booth, was chosen as the movie's executive producer; she is also set to act in it. McG is set to be the director. Graphic novel Steven Cummings illustrated Uglies in a manga-style graphic novel written by Westerfeld and Devin K. Grayson called Shay's Story which tells the story from Shay's perspective. It was published in a black-and-white 5¬æ x 8¬º inches format by Del Rey Manga in 2012. Publication history The novel Uglies was first published in 2006, and re-released in 2011 with a new cover.Westerfeld Publication Page It is the first part of a trilogy, with sequels Pretties, and Specials, and another book Extras.

Early and family life John Echols was born in Lynchburg, Virginia. He joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1840 and resigned in the next year; being made an honorary graduate in 1843. He received further education at Washington College and at Harvard College. A tall imposing man, standing 6 feet 4 inches tall, Echols quickly became a leader among his peers. Echols married twice. His first wife was a sister of Senator Allen T. Caperton (also of what became West Virginia). After she died, he married Mrs. Mary Helen Cochran Reid, a widow from New York City. Early legal and political career On becoming a lawyer in 1843 he settled in Union, Monroe County (now West Virginia). Echols represented Monroe County in the Virginia House of Delegates 1852-1853 and in the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861.Sullivan, Ken (ed.), The West Virginia Encyclopedia, The West Virginia Humanities Council, 2006, pg. 210. Confederate service Both Echols and Allen T. Caperton voted for Virginia's secession from the United States on April 17, 1861 at the Richmond convention.How Virginia Convention Delegates Voted on Secession on, April 4 and April 17, 1861 When the secession ordinance was put to public vote on May 23 Monroe County voted 1,085 to 79 in favor of secession.Curry, Richard Orr, A House Divided, A Study of Statehood Politics and the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia, Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pg. 146 Echols offered his service to Virginia. He gathered a group of volunteers and was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel. On May 6, 1861, General Robert E. Lee ordered Lieutenant Colonel Echols to call out and muster in volunteer forces, not to exceed two regiments, to rendezvous these men at Staunton for Joseph E. Johnston's fledgling army.The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1, Vol. 2, Washington, DC, 1880, pg. 808 Echols was then assigned command of the 27th Virginia Infantry, leading the regiment in the fighting at the First Battle of Manassas under Stonewall Jackson. He was soon promoted to colonel, serving in the Valley Campaign. He was severely wounded at the First Battle of Kernstown on March 23, disabling him for several weeks. Echols was promoted to brigadier general on April 16, 1862Eicher, p. 222. during his convalescence. Later in the year, he was assigned to command a brigade of the army of Western Virginia. He participated as a brigade commander in William W. Loring's occupation of the Kanawha Valley in September. After Loring withdrew to the mountains, Echols replaced him in command of the Department of Western Virginia. He promptly reoccupied Charleston, but was forced to retreat by a superior enemy force. Echols resigned his departmental command in the fall of 1862, and, during the following summer, served upon the three-man court of inquiry held in Richmond to investigate the cause of the fall of Vicksburg. Later in the year, he commanded the Confederate forces in the Battle of Droop Mountain, stubbornly resisting a series of Federal attacks. In May 1864, he commanded John C. Breckinridge's right wing at the Battle of New Market in the Shenandoah Valley. General Robert E. Lee recalled Echols' Brigade was recalled to rejoin the Army of Northern Virginia near Cold Harbor during the Siege of Petersburg. On August 22, 1864, he was given charge of the District of Southwestern Virginia, and on March 29, 1865, Echols was assigned command of the western department of Virginia, relieving General Breckinridge, who had joined the staff of President Jefferson Davis. On April 2, Echols, with nearly 7,000 men, began a hasty march to unite with Lee. He reached Christiansburg, Virginia, on April 10, where he received a telegram announcing Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse. At a solemn council of war, Echols decided to march to unite with Johnston's army, and Echols led two brigades southward towards North Carolina. Subsequently, he accompanied President Davis to Augusta, Georgia. Postwar career Monroe County had been included in the new state of West Virginia without its consent and the new state government would not allow ex-Confederates to practice law.Morton, Oren F., A History of Monroe County, West Virginia, Ruebush-Elkins Co., Dayton, VA, 1916, pg. 156 Ambler, Charles Henry, A History of West Virginia. Prentice-Hall, 1933, pg. 363 After the war, Echols resumed the practice of law in Staunton. He helped select the members of the Committee of Nine, a group of state leaders who worked to ensure that the state be readmitted into the Union and former Confederates could once again hold political office. Echols returned to the Virginia House of Delegates 1878-1881, representing Staunton and Augusta County. While there, he sided with the Funders against the Readjusters, which briefly reunited Republicans and liberal Democrats, and tried to allocate some of Virginia's massive wartime debt to West Virginia and had supported Reconstruction. He rebuilt his fortune and became President of the Staunton National Valley Bank. When the hastily agglomerated Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern Railroad went bankrupt, he became its Receiver and General Manager. He lived in Kentucky the last ten years of his life as he managed the railroad's affairs. Death and legacy He died at Oakdene the residence of his son, Edward Echols (later lieutenant governor of Virginia), at Staunton, where he is buried in Thornrose Cemetery. The General Echols House located in Union, Monroe County, West Virginia, is significant for its association with John Echols, A Brigadier General in the army of the Confederate States of America. The house possesses additional distinction as one of Monroe County's oldest and best preserved examples of Greek Revival architecture.

The Rome diagnostic criteria are set forth by Rome Foundation, a not for profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. History Several systematic approaches attempted to classify functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). As a result, there were several key events which ultimately led to the current Rome Classification. In 1962, Chaudhary and Truelove published their study of IBS patients in Oxford, England. This was the first attempt to classify the new field of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Much of what they reported has persisted to the present day.Chaudhary NA, Truelove SC.

Subsequently, in 1978 came the \\"Manning Criteria\\" developed by Heaton and colleagues in Bristol. This characterized IBS-D (IBS with predominant diarrhea), but importantly, a cluster of symptoms which were characteristic for this disorder.

The functional gastrointestinal disorders: diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment. McLean (VA): Degnon Associates, 1994. The Rome criteria have been evolving from the first set of criteria issued in 1989 (The Rome Guidelines for IBS) through the Rome Classification System for functional gastrointestinal disorders (1990), or Rome-1, the Rome I Criteria for IBS (1992) and the functional gastrointestinal disorders (1994), the Rome II Criteria for IBS (1999) and the functional gastrointestinal disorders (1999) to the Rome III Criteria (2006). \\"Rome II\\" and \\"Rome III\\" incorporated pediatric criteria to the consensus. The Rome IV update was published 10 years later in May 2016. This covers epidemiology, pathophysiology, psychosocial and clinical features, and diagnostic evaluation and treatment recommendations for 33 adult and 17 pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders. Process The Rome criteria are achieved and finally issued through a consensual process, using the Delphi method (or Delphi technique).

The foundation provides support for activities which foster clinical research, data and educational information which aid in the diagnosis and treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders.\\"Meet the Rome Foundation,\\" 2017. Retrieved from https://theromefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Meet-The-Rome- Foundation-2017-web.pdfhttps://theromefoundation.org/presentations-videos/ Over the last 25 years, the Rome organization has sought to legitimize and update the knowledge of functional GI disorders. This has been accomplished by bringing together scientists and clinicians from around the world to classify and critically appraise the science of gastrointestinal function and dysfunction. This knowledge permits clinical scientists to make recommendations for diagnosis and treatment that can be applied in research and clinical practice. The mission is to improve the lives of people with these disorders. The goals of the Rome Foundation are to promote global recognition and legitimization of FGIDs, advance the scientific understanding of their pathophysiology, optimize clinical management for these patients and develop and provide educational resources to accomplish these goals. Definition of functional gastrointestinal disorders/disorders of gut-brain interaction  Using the Delphi method, the Rome Foundation and its board of directors, chairs and co-chairs of the ROME IV committees developed the current definition for disorders of gut-brain interaction. A group of disorders classified by GI symptoms related to any combination of: * Motility disturbance * Visceral hypersensitivity * Altered mucosal and immune function * Altered gut microbiota * Altered central nervous system (CNS) processing Evolution of Rome criteria=Rome I In 1994, Rome I was published as The Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders:Diagnosis, Pathophysiology, and Treatment‚ÄîA Multinational Consensus. Rome II By the mid-1990s, the concept of FGID classification and the use of diagnostic criteria was promoted due to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended the use of the IBS criteria for selection into pharmaceutical studies, and the pharmaceutical companies took interest in supporting the efforts of the Rome Foundation to improve the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of FGIDs and to also apply the use of these criteria in their pharmaceutical studies. In Rome II, the pediatric population of FGIDs was added. Rome III After publication of Rome II, the number of studies published using the Rome criteria in clinical trials grew tremendously over the next 15 years. Rome III differed from Rome I and II by the use of more evidence-based rather than consensus-based data. Rome IV After publication of Rome III in 2006, the Rome Foundation was well recognized as the authoritative body developing diagnostic criteria for research and also for providing education about the FGIDs. Rome IV tried to address the limitations of a symptom-based criteria in several ways: * Some criteria have been simplified and cases not meeting criteria for research can still be identified and treated. * Global education on FGIDs help to understand and characterize the cross-cultural differences in symptom reporting. * Provide translations into other languages * Creation of diagnostic algorithms for a functional GI disorder diagnosis or other diagnosis # To address the severity and variability of clinical presentation, a Multidimensional Clinical Profile (MDCP) system has been created that incorporates the diagnostic criteria with additional clinical, quality of life, psychosocial, and physiological (including biomarker) parameters to more precisely create an individualized treatment plan for the patient. * To help clinicians be better trained in the diagnostic algorithms and the MDCP, the Rome Foundation is developing an interactive, intelligent software platform that will help clinicians make real-time treatment decisions using the diagnostic algorithms and MDCP knowledge base.Drossman DA.

Rome IV functional gastrointestinal disorders: disorders of gut-brain interaction.I. Raleigh, NC: The Rome Foundation; 2016. pp 1‚Äì32. In Rome IV, the classification moved from a physiologically based classification to a symptom-based classification. The classifications were based upon organ regions (i.e. esophageal, gastroduodenal, bowel, biliary, anorectal).  Rome IV criteria/classification  The original Rome classification was first published in 1990 and has since been modified with each iteration to develop the subsequent classifications with Rome II, III and IV. Beginning with the original publication in 1990 and leading to Rome I, the classification moved from a physiologically based classification to a symptom-based classification with additional classifications based upon organ regions (i.e. esophageal, gastroduodenal, bowel, biliary, anorectal). The current Rome IV classification is the culmination of the evolution of a series of iterations (Rome I, Rome II,Drossman DA, Corazziari E, Talley NJ, et al., eds. Rome II: the functional gastrointestinal disorders. 2nd ed. McLean (VA): Degnon Associates, 2000. and Rome IIIDrossman DA, Corazziari E, Delvaux M, et al., eds. Rome III: the functional gastrointestinal disorders. 3rd ed. McLean (VA): Degnon Associates, 2006.) with its inception as Rome I. The Rome criteria are a set of criteria used by clinicians to classify a diagnosis of a patient with an FGID (disorder of gut-brain interaction). These Rome criteria are updated every 6‚Äì10 years. The current Rome IV classification, published in 2016, is as follows: A. Esophageal Disorders *A1. Functional chest pain *A2. Functional heartburn *A3. Reflux hypersensitivity *A4. Globus *A5. Functional dysphagia B. Gastroduodenal Disorders *B1. Functional dyspepsia **B1a. Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) **B1b. Epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) *B2. Belching disorders **B2a. Excessive supragastric belching **B2b. Excessive gastric belching *B3. Nausea and vomiting disorders **B3a. Chronic nausea vomiting syndrome (CNVS) **B3b. Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) **B3c.

Nonretentive fecal incontinence Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) FGIDs share in common any of several physiological features including increased motor reactivity, enhanced visceral hypersensitivity, altered mucosal immune and inflammatory function (associated with bacterial dysbiosis), and altered central nervous system and enteric nervous system (CNS-ENS) regulation. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of FGID has been best conceptualized using biopsychosocial model help to explain the relationships between an individual factors in their early life that intern can influence their psychosocial factor and physiological functioning. This model also shows the complex interactions between these factors through the brain-gut axis.Drossman DA. Biopsychosocial issues in gastroenterology. In: Feldman M, Friedman LS, and Brandt LJ ads. Sleisenger and Fordtran's gastrointestinal and liver disease. 10th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier, 2015:349‚Äì362.Mayer EA, Savage T, Shulman RJ. Brain-gut microbiome interactions and functional bowel disorders. Gastroenterology 2014;146:1500‚Äì1512.Jones MP, Dilley JB, Crowell MD et al. Brain-gut connections in functional GI disorders: anatomic and physiological relationships. Neurogastroenterol Motel 2006; 18:91‚Äì103Drossman DA. Presidential Address Address: Gastrointestinal Illness and the Biopsychosocial Model. Psychosomatic Medicine 1998;60:258‚Äì267 These factors affect how FGID manifest in terms of symptoms but also affect the clinical outcome. These factors are interconnected and the influences on these factors are bidirectional and mutually interactive. Early life factors Early life factors include genetic factors, psychophysiological and sociocultural factors, and environmental exposures. * Genetics ‚Äì Several polymorphisms and candidate genes may predispose individuals to develop FGID. These include alpha-2 adrenergic and 5-HT receptors; serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT, NET); inflammatory markers interleukin-(IL)10, tumor necrosis factor-(TNF) alpha, and TNF super family member 15 (TNF-SF15); intracellular cell signaling (G proteins); and ion channels (SCN5A).Saito YA, TAlley NJ. Genetics of irritable bowel syndrome. Am J Gastroenterol 2008;103:2100‚Äì2104. However, the expression of a FGID requires the influence of additional environmental exposures such as infection, illness modeling and other factors. * Psychophysiological factors may affect the expression of these genes, thus leading to symptoms production associated with FGID.Tran L, Chaloner A, Sawalha AH, et al. Importance of epigenetic mechanisms in visceral pain induced by chronic water avoidance stress. Psychoneuroendocrinology 2013;38:898‚Äì906 * Sociocultural factors and family interactions have been shown to shape later reporting of symptoms, the development of FGIDs, and health care seeking. The expression of pain varies across cultures as well including denial of symptoms to dramatic expression.Zborowski M. Cultural components in responses to pain. J Social Issues 1952;8:16‚Äì30. * Environmental exposures ‚Äì Prior studies have shown the effect of environmental exposures in relation to the development of FGIDs. Environmental exposures such as childhood salmonella infection can be a risk factor for IBS in adulthood.Cremon C, Stanghellini V, Pallotti F, et al. Salmonella gastroenteritis during childhood is a risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome in adulthood. Gastroenterology 2014:147:69‚Äì77 Psychosocial factors Psychosocial factors influence the functioning of the GI tract through the brain-gut axis (motility, sensitivity, barrier function). They also affect experience and behavior, treatment selection and the clinical outcome. Psychological stress or one's emotional response to stress exacerbates gastrointestinal symptoms and may contribute to FGID development.Drossman DA. The Rome IV Committees, editor. Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders and the Rome IV process. In: Drossman DA, Chang L, Chey WD, Kellow J, Tack J, Whitehead WE, editors. Rome IV functional gastrointestinal disorders: disorders of gut-brain interaction. I. Raleigh, NC: The Rome Foundation; 2016. pp 1‚Äì32.Collins SM, Chang C, Mearin F. Postinfectious chronic gut dysfunction: from bench to bedside. Am J Gastroenterol Suppl 2012;1:2‚Äì8 Physiology The physiology of FGID is characterized by abnormal motility, visceral hypersensitivity as well as dysregulation of the immune system and barrier function of the GI tract as well as inflammatory changes. * Abnormal motility Studies have shown altered muscle contractility and tone, bowel compliance, and transit may contribute to many of the gastrointestinal symptoms of FGID which may include diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting.Camilleri M. Peripheral mechanisms in irritable bowel syndrome. N Engl J Med 2012;367:1626‚Äì1635 * Visceral hypersensitivity In FGID there is poor association of pain with GI motility in many functional GI disorders. These patient often have a lower pain threshold with balloon distension of the bowel (visceral hyperalgesia), or they have increased sensitivity even to normal intestinal function; Visceral hypersensitivity may be amplified in patients with FGIDs.Delgado-Aros S, Camilleri M. Visceral hypersensitivity. J Clin Gastronenterol 2005;39:S194-S203Mayer EA, Gebhart GF. Basic and clinical aspects of visceral hyperalgesia. Gastroenterology 1994;107:271‚Äì293 * Immune dysregulation, inflammation, and barrier dysfunction Studies on postinfectious IBS have shown that factors such as mucosal membrane permeability, the intestinal flora, and altered mucosal immune function. Ultimately leading to visceral hypersensitivity. Factors contributing to this occurrence include genetics, psychological stress, and altered receptor sensitivity at the gut mucosa and myenteric plexus, which are enabled by mucosal immune dysfunction.Zhou Q, Zhang B, Verne GE. Intestinal membrane permeability and hypersensitivity in the irritable bowel syndrome. Pain 2009;146:41‚Äì46Camilleri M, Madsen K, Spiller R, et al. Intestinal barrier function in health and gastrointestinal disease. Neurogastroenterol Motil 2012; 24:503‚Äì512 * Microbiome There has been increased attention to the role of bacteria and the microbiome in overall health and disease. There is evidence for a group of microorganisms which play a role in the brain-gut axis.Mayer EA, Savage T, Shulman RJ. Brain- gut micro biome interactions and functional bowel disorders. Gastroenterology 2014;146:1500‚Äì1512. Studies have revealed that the bacterial composition of the gastrointestinal tract in IBS patient differs from healthy individuals (e.g., increased Firmicutes and reduced Bacteroidetes and Bifidobacteria)Simr√©n M, Barbara G, Flint HJ, et al. Intestinal microbiota in functional bowel disorders: a Rome Foundation working team report. Gut 2013;1:159‚Äì176 However, further research is needed to determine the role of the microbiome in FGIDs. * Food and diet The types of food consumed and diet consumed plays a role in the manifestation of FGIDChey WD. The role of food in the functional gastrointestinal disorders: introduction to a manuscript series. Am J Gastroenterol 2013;108:694‚Äì697. and also their relationship to intestinal microbiota.Rajilic-Stojanavic M, Jonkers DM, Salonen A, et al. Intestinal microbiota and diet in IBS: causes, consequences, or epiphenomena? Am J Gastroenterol 2015; 110:278‚Äì287. Studies have shown that specific changes in diet (e.g., low FODMAP‚Äîfermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols, or gluten restriction in some patients) may help and reduce the symptom burden in FGID. However, no one diet has been shown to be recommended for all people. Brain-gut axis The brain-gut axis is the mechanism in which the psychosocial factors influence the GI tract and vice versa. There is communication between emotional and cognitive centers of the brain to the GI tract and vice versa.Gaman A, Kuo B. Neuromodulatory processes of the brain-gut axis. Neuromodulation 2008; 11:249‚Äì259 Emotions have been shown to stimulate colon motor function and result in decreased colonic transit time, increased contractile activity, the induction of defecation, and symptoms of diarrhea.

In 2005, it was awarded the Essen Feather. The main character of the game is Pedro. He begins the game on the centre of a small island that is surrounded by water infested with piranhas. Each player has an identical hand of 12 cards - three of which move him up, three of which move him down, three of which move him left, and three of which move him right. One card for each direction moves three spaces in that direction, one moves two, and one moves one. One player is chosen to be the initial starting player, and all players choose a card to play. Simultaneously, players reveal their cards. The starting player has his or her card take effect first - they move Pedro the number of spaces in the direction indicated on the card. The next player then plays the effect of their card, and so on, until all cards have been played, or a player is eaten by piranhas. If a player moves Pedro onto a water space, they must spend a rock. Each player begins with four rocks. They place the rock in the water space on which they moved onto. Rocks can be safely moved over without spending another rock. If the player has no rocks left, Pedro drowns, and is eaten by piranhas. The player whose card made Pedro drown takes one of the piranhas off the board, which counts as a point towards them. If a card causes Pedro to move onto one of the piranhas on the board, Pedro is eaten by that piranha. If a player moves off the grid on the board, Pedro drowns and is eaten by piranhas. Once a player drowns, all players discard their leftover stones, then check the cards they did not play. They receive one stone for each card that moves Pedro one space which they did not play, 1/2 for each card that moves Pedro two spaces for which they did not play (rounded down), and none for each card that moves Pedro three spaces. Once a player has been eaten by piranhas twice and receives two points, they lose, and all the other players win. If all the cards played take effect, then all players choose another card to play, and so on, until a player is eaten by piranhas. If players run out of cards, then they receive their hands back. The game is heavily based around the concept of second-guessing.

Career Born in Nevis, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Walwyn had trials for Barnsley and Preston North End before playing for Guiseley from 1977 to 1978. Following a trial with Bradford City he joined Winterton Rangers in 1979 before signing for Chesterfield in November 1979 for a fee of ¬£5,000. He appeared only three times for the club's first team, scoring two goals, despite being a regular scorer in the reserve team. He was signed by York City for a fee of ¬£4,000 in July 1981. During his time with the club, Walwyn played 291 games and scored 140 goals (119 in the league), becoming the club's second all-time top scorer behind Norman Wilkinson. This tally included 25 goals in City's historic 1983‚Äì84 Fourth Division championship-winning side. He won the Clubman of the Year trophy for the 1981‚Äì82 and 1986‚Äì87 seasons. He was transferred to Blackpool for a transfer tribunal-set fee of ¬£35,000 in July 1987, and scored 16 league goals in 69 appearances for the club. He moved next, in July 1989, to Carlisle United, who would prove to be his last League club. The final club he played for was non-League side Kettering Town, whom he signed for in February 1991. He made seven appearances and scored one goal for Kettering in the Football Conference. He was forced to quit playing in March after he collapsed in a match against Altrincham. He later had a pacemaker fitted. Post-football and death After his footballing career ended, Walwyn opened a sports store in the Preston area. In August 2002, he was guest of honour at the opening of Blackpool's new ¬£7 million West Stand when Blackburn Rovers visited Bloomfield Road.

History  Derhak's earliest known time performing as a member of a band was on Halloween 1989, playing at a party with guitarist Chuck Garvey and a drummer named Ray Schwartz. He officially formed a band with Garvey, Schwartz, and others, in the Winter of 1990, calling themselves \\"Five Guys Named Moe\\", after the Louis Jordan song. They played several shows in the Buffalo, New York area. By the fall of 1990 the band was officially called moe., with the full stop being added the following year. Derhak went to college at State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY) where the band moe. was solidified. Derhak was diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer in July 2017, prompting moe. to go on indefinite hiatus to allow time for his treatment. Derhak was declared cancer-free in December 2017 which coincided with moe. announcing a 2018 return to live performance. Moe returned to the stage at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester NY on February 2, 2018 and have since resumed a regular touring schedule.

Located approximately east of Ho Chi Minh City, it has been approved to start construction by the Vietnamese government on April 1, 2021. And the Vietnamese government has decided to begin construction in May 2021 and it will be finished by 2025. https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/economy/work-on-long-thanh-airport-can- begin-in-may-2021-acv-4085116.html It will serve over 100 million passengers annually when built to the maximum designed capacity. History=Urgent necessity for a new airport Tan Son Nhat International Airport is the only international airport in the planned Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area (covering , with an estimated population of 20-22 million inhabitants by 2020, of which there will be 16 - 17 million urban inhabitants, accounting for 77 - 80% of total population). Tan Son Nhat airport was built during the Vietnam War to support war transportation, hence its location inside the crowded Ho Chi Minh City where growth is limited. Due to location and safety issues, it is difficult to expand to meet the increasing annual growth of passengers. The maximum design capacity of Tan Son Nhat is 25 million passengers per annum but in 2016 it handled 32.5 million.Long Thanh Airport on Dong Nai government official website The flow of international tourists to the South of Vietnam is increasing dramatically, by 15 to 20 percent annually. Promoting the domestic market (current population of 87 million, forecast of 100 million by 2020) by building a new airport that can adapt to future needs is necessary. Tan Son Nhat airport will serve the international and domestic flights until the completion of the new Long Thanh International Airport. The airport will be able to handle the world's biggest commercial aircraft. Under current plans by the Vietnamese government, the Airports Corporation of Vietnam will be the main investor and operator of the airport. Master Plan The Master Plan for Long Thanh International Airport was approved by the Prime Minister Phan VƒÉn Kh·∫£i in 2006 and several adjustments have been made through time. The project faced mixed public reaction for its expensive cost and far distance from the center of Ho Chi Minh City. Based on the demand of transportation, the investment will be divided in phases. The Southern Airports Corporation (a company under the Ministry of Transport (Vietnam)) is in charge of development of this project. Phase 1 (2019 ‚Äì 2025) The first phase is estimated to cost US$7.8billion and will be divided into 3 sub-phases. =Phase 1A (2019 ‚Äì 2023)= According to the original plan, the airport would handle 25 million passengers per year after this phase is completed; however, the proposed capacity was later lowered to 17 million passengers per year to reduce construction cost. US$5.6billion will be allocated to this phase. One terminal will be built along with a single runway. =Phase 1B (2023 ‚Äì 2025)= Another runway will be built and increase the total capacity to 25 million passengers per annum. =Phase 1C (2025)= The rest of necessary facilities will be built and land-clearance for future phases will be made. The airport will begin operating in 2025. Phase 2 (2025 ‚Äì 2035) The capacity will be doubled to 50 million passengers per annum and the third runway will be added when the phase is finished, which is scheduled to be in 2035. Phase 3 (After 2035) The airport will reach its maximum designed capacity at 80-100 million passengers and 5 million tonnes of cargo per year. Four runways will be operational after the third phase. Ground transportation=Road The airport will be accessible via the National Highway 51, Bien Hoa-Vung Tau Expressway and Ho Chi Minh City‚ÄìLong Thanh‚ÄìDau Giay Expressway, construction is expected be completed before the airport opens in 2025. A third road is planned east of the airport and will connect with the Dau Giay‚ÄìPhan Thiet Expressway as part of the second phase of the airport plan from 2025. The airport will also be accessible via the future Bien Hoa‚ÄìVung Tau Expressway. Rail A new high-speed railway service is proposed to be connected to the new airport as part of the Ho Chi Minh City‚ÄìNha Trang section of the North- South high-speed railway line. Airport planners propose a high-speed railway line be built to the airport as it will give passengers a more direct and efficient transit option to Ho Chi Minh City than by road which is already congested closer to the city centre. There are also future plans for a light metro line connecting the airport to Thu Thiem.

She escapes from Caliban on the monorail and hides with two willing young male collaborators, who enjoy the intrigue Risque brings. Caliban finally catches up with her in a maintenance tunnel but he collapses. This was due to numerous biological tampering done to him over the years. Risque initially desires to flee before calling for 9-1-1, but her conscience forces her to stay behind and tend to the injured mutant. Her reluctance to leave when she had the chance caused her to be captured by the remaining members of X-Force, who initially believe she has harmed Caliban. By the time X-Force arrives, a two and a half hour ride in their Pacrat, Warpath reveals that he was not held captive and was ready to leave, with Sledge's offer fresh on his mind. Risque tries to make amends with Warpath but to no avail; pleading her case concerning her debt to Sledge does not work. Unfortunately, her betrayal of Warpath's trust mars their relationship, as she had feared it would. As their relationship seemed to be finished, a joyful Siryn smirks in the distance.X-Force v.1 #66 Reunion with X-Force Months later, Risque ran into X-Force again while she was helping the Vanisher steal the Heart of Pele, a sacred Hawaiian gem. However, when she is attacked by one of the Lava Men, Warpath saves her and gets X-Force involved in the quest for the stone. They eventually return the stone to Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of the volcano. This prevents the Lava Men from using the Gem to activate ancient 'Deviant' machinery. Every volcano on Earth would have erupted if the Lava Men plan succeeded. It turns out, though, that 'Risque' was in fact Pele herself and the real Risque, who had come to find the Heart, was still asleep on the beach. The team reunites with the real Gloria Mu√±oz and vacation on the island together.X-Force v.1 #81 Shortly after the incident in Hawaii, the psychic and physical connection between Danielle Moonstar and Arcadia spawns a new Demon Bear that rampaged through Sledge's warehouse. Risque is sent to help X-Force defeat the bear in San Francisco. Unfortunately, she is of very little help, and spends most of the time flirting with Warpath.X-Force v.1 #99-100 X-Corporation and \\"Death\\" After the Xavier Institute became outed as a mutant organization, Risque was apparently contacted by Charles Xavier, who made her part of his X-Corporation monitoring mutant rights violations in Asia. Risque finds out about a company trafficking in mutant body parts. Unfortunately, she was ambushed by the U-Men, followers of John Sublime, founder of the Third Species movement. Risque did manage to compress one of her attackers into the size of a baseball, but could not fend them all off and was slain. Her death scene was never seen on-panel nor was a body ever shown, but her seeming demise was supported by her former X-Force ally and X-Corporation teammate Domino.New X-Men Annual 2001 Possible Return Risque was among a list of possible candidates to join the superhero group the Lady Liberators.Hulk #9 It is not known if this is the original Risque or a new hero re-using her moniker. Necrosha Risque is among the dead mutants resurrected by the transmode virus that Selene sends to attack X-Force. She is one of the few mutants who regained control of her body and was able to warn Warpath to escape before succumbing to the virus and resuming her assault.X-Force (Vol.3) #21 Gloria's final fate is uncertain as it is unknown whether she was among the mutants teleported to Genosha by Blink to serve as sacrifices for the newly deified Selene or if she was among the mutants who managed to escape Utopia. Powers and abilities Risque can create localized gravity fields to affect inorganic matter, placing a gravitronic charge within an object to compress it into a small, high-density mass and then maneuver that gravity charge to propel the object at high velocities. She could also use her powers to project concussive blasts. As part of her gravity- manipulation powers, she could also levitate the objects she was compressing.

Its home is a four-sheet facility located in Ferndale, Michigan. It is one of the oldest curling clubs in the United States, founded in 1840. The present-day club was founded in 1885.  Origins and history  The Detroit Curling Club was founded by local farmers and was one of several organizations that had been formed in the Detroit area post-civil war. These groups largely contested their games on a frozen Orchard Lake - in recent years, divers have found curling rocks from these games at the lake's bottom. The club first moved to an outside facility next to the Detroit Athletic Club and built its first indoor facility in 1906 at 1236 Forest Avenue in Detroit. In 1979, the facility was bought out by an expanding Wayne State University, and the club moved to a new home in West Bloomfield, Michigan. Hard times fell on the club in the mid-1990s when small membership numbers and high taxes threatened the life of the club. For a few years, the club looked for a new, dedicated facility that would suit the club for years to come. An arrangement was drawn up with the city of Ferndale, the club purchased land in Martin Road Park, then donated the land back to the city, and leased the property for 99 years. This allowed the club to build a new rink with curling in mind. The current facility opened in January 2002. With network coverage of curling during the 2002 and 2006 winter Olympics, membership has soared and in February 2006, a single day open house drew a crowd of 500 first-time curlers. The facility also doubles as a community center in the summer time when the club does not curl as it is too difficult to maintain the ice during the summer heat. The club is a founding member of the Ontario Curling Association despite being in a different country. Members are allowed to play in provincial championships in Ontario.

She was named interim leader of the Wildrose Party on December 22, 2014, following the defection of the previous leader, Danielle Smith, and eight other MLAs. Forsyth is a former member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the constituency of Calgary-Fish Creek as a Wildrose Alliance representative. She was a Progressive Conservative until she crossed the floor on January 4, 2010. In the 2012 Alberta general election, Forsyth was reelected along with 16 other Wildrose MLAs to form the Official Opposition. Wildrose Leader Danielle Smith then appointed Forsyth as Health Critic. Forsyth retired from Alberta politics in 2015 after her stint as interim leader of the Wildrose Party.  Political work  Heather Forsyth was first elected on June 15, 1993 and served for a total of 21 years, 10 months and 21 days. She spent the entire length of her political career representing the Calgary-Fish Creek constituency. Forsyth was a member of the Progressive Conservative party from June 15, 1993 until January 4, 2010 until she crossed the floor to the Wildrose Party, which she remained a part of until her retirement in 2015. While in office, she served as member, chair and deputy chair of numerous standing committees, 56 in total. Forsyth also held positions such as Critic for Service Alberta, Health, Critic for Culture and Community Services, Critic for Employment and Immigration, Critic for Health and Wellness as well as Critic for Seniors. Forsyth also held the position of Solicitor General from March 19, 2001 until November 24, 2004, and was Minister of Children's Services from November 25, 2004 until December 14, 2006. In 1997, Forsyth led the Task Force on Children Involved in Prostitution and helped submit a report that recommended changes to the Child Welfare Act entitled, Children Involved In Prostitution: Report by The Task Force on Children Involved in Prostitution. In 2000, Forsyth was chair of the Alberta Advisory Committee on Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation and was involved with the report entitled A Framework for Action: A Coordinated and Integrated Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplant System for Alberta. In 2007, Forsyth led the Crime Reduction and Safe Communities Task Force as chair and submitted the report entitled Keeping Communities Safe: Report and Recommendations. Forsyth was successful in winning 6 elections over her political career. Typically, Forsyth was elected with substantial leads over her opponents but notably, one of her narrowest victories occurred in the 2012 Alberta general election, where she edged out her main competitor from the Progressive Conservative Party, Wendelin Fraser, by a count of 38 votes. Forsyth is perhaps best known for being named Interim Leader of the Wildrose Party, which occurred after the departure of former Wildrose leader, Danielle Smith and nine other former Wildrose MLAs to the Progressive Conservative party. At the time, Forsyth knew that she would not be seeking reelection due to family reasons, but said that she would be willing to offer her leadership until the next election that would eventually take place on May 5, 2015.  Charity work  Heather Forsyth is also known for her charity golf tournament: The Peanut Butter Classic. The tournament is an annual women's charity golf tournament. Forsyth founded the charity, which collects and donates jars of peanut butter for the Calgary Food Bank in 2003. Since its foundation, the Peanut Butter Classic has also raised over 1.7 million dollars for charities in the Calgary area including Alcove, an addictions recovery centre for women that offers accommodations for women and children to keep them together. The charity is entirely oranzized and operated by volunteers. Calgary firefighters have been involved in volunteering at the event since its earliest days. The tournament gives 98% of its proceeds to charity.

They have been referred to as the \\"East Asian pygmies\\". They are allegedly descended from an ethnic group concentrated in China known as Derung who migrated to Burma from Tibet in the 1880s. Like the Pygmies of Central Africa and the Negritos of Southeast Asia, the Tarons are very small, averaging less than 129.5 cm (4 feet and 3 inches). Evolutionary history The Tarons have received their name from their original homeland, the headwaters of the Taron River (Derong/Dulong). Leaving their original homeland around 200 years ago, the Tarons moved into Burma territory through the Thalalarkha mountain pass. They settled in Kachin State, in the lower Adunlaung River valley in the Naung Mun Township of Putao District. The landscape is dense forests and difficult terrain, with torrential streams and snow-clad mountains that are home to rare wild animals such as the blue sheep and the leaf deer. In the 1960s, a Burmese research expedition found over 50 pure-blood pygmies, and although cases of cretinism, mental retardation, goiter, and other physical and mental ailments were noted, they felt as though the community would sustain itself. A 1997 field trip commissioned by the Kachin State Peace and Development Council revealed that only eight individuals of pure Taron stock remained. It makes the Taron one of the most highly endangered human populations in the world today. Alan Rabinowitz visited their village to learn about the Taron pygmies in the late 1990s, and discovered the fate of the tribe. Dawi, age 39, the youngest remaining Taron pure-blood, explained that Taron babies were being born with increasingly severe birth defects, without any known cause. The Taron elders decided that rather than risk any more misshapen children, their race would go extinct. As a child, Dawi's father demanded that he would not marry or have children. Rabinowitz's visit was followed by anthropologist P. Christiaan Klieger of the California Academy of Sciences in 2003. Then, Dawi announced he would travel to Tibet or Yunnan in order to search for a wife, since many Taron/Dulong people lived there. Link with the Derung people It has been proposed by Richard D. Fisher that the Taron people are descended from the Derung people who are based in the Dulong Valley in Yunnan, China. There are currently approximately 5,000 ethnic Derung people living in six designated villages within the valley. This is based on Klieger's work. Derung is simply a Chinese term for Taron or T'rung. Genetic similarities between the two ethnic groups have been observed, and it has been purported that all the Taron people were derived from three Derung people who migrated from Tibet to Myanmar in the 1880s.

Johnny Seven O.M.A. was the best selling boys' toy of 1964,(according to sales reports provided by two industry magazines of that year, Playthings and Toys & Novelties) and was marketed heavily on children's television. It has a unique number of features, including seven different actions (thus the \\"Seven\\" in the name). The toy is no longer made, and has become a collector's item.eBay Guides - A Topper Toys Johnny Seven One Man Army Tutorial  Functions  All of the firing mechanisms are attached to the main rifle assembly, the pistol inserts from the bottom to provide the rifle grip (the pistol also holds caps for authentic firing sounds). The \\"Rifle\\" function shot twelve white bullets one at a time via a bolt action spring mechanism through the silver barrel. Three different \\"rockets\\" (The green Armour Piercing shell, Anti Bunker and the red Anti Tank fired via spring action on the main barrel. The Grenade Launcher was on top of the gun. Johnny Seven also featured a bipod that provided stability for the various rockets and grenade. The stock could be removed to shorten the weapon while in the \\"Tommy Gun\\" mode. The toy when fully assembled was over three feet long, and weighed about four pounds. Grenade Launcher A grenade launcher is located on top of the main body, above the pistol grip. The launcher extends upwards, and the spring loaded grenade is launched by depressing a button on the side of the rifle. Anti Tank Rocket The red \\"Armour Piercing\\" missile is fired from a launcher located on the right of the body of the gun. The firing button is placed underneath the launcher. Armour Piercing Shell / Anti Bunker Missile The two large green shells were fired from the front of the rifle directly above the Rifle barrel. The firing button is on the left side of the rifle. Repeating Rifle Twelve white bullets are fired from a fixed magazine on the rifle. The bullets are fed into the chamber by a spring- loaded bolt, one at a time. Tommy Gun Pull the lever back towards the stock, press the release button and you get a \\"rat-a-tat\\" machine gun noise. Automatic Pistol The cap firing pistol could be removed from the gun. Accessories To replace lost components, Topper also marketed an additional spare ammunition pack that comprised a complete set of four grenade/missiles and twelve bullets. Additional toy accessories were marketed under the \\"Johnny Seven\\" banner including a helmet and walkie-talkies. Deluxe Reading used the Topper Toys brand to add a modern flair to their new product lines. Deluxe Reading was famous for creating huge package playsets that could be seen by children when viewing the top, unusable shelf in grocery store chains. By creating large, colorful boxes, the space could be used to market to the children that always accompanied parents while food shopping, an unusual marketing \\"trick\\" that worked well for Deluxe Reading and later copycat toy companies, such as Remco. The \\"Johnny Seven\\" box came in two variations, one a standard box showing a boy looking through the sights of the gun, and the second (Rare now for collectors) showed a \\"Battle field\\" scenario behind the mounted gun with a see through plastic lid. The Johnny Seven gun was manufactured in four countries, and in order of rarity for collectors purposes, they were Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada (in a dual-language box) and the American version. Deluxe Reading Deluxe Reading produced many memorable toys including the Johnny Lightning cars (similar to Mattel's Hot Wheels), the Crime Buster Gun (similar to the O.M.A, only geared towards kids play acting cops and robbers), the Operation X 500 Space Base and others.

Biography  Bust of Claude-Joseph Vernet, 1783 CE. From Paris, France. By Louis-Simon Boizot. The Victoria and Albert Museum, London The Toilet of Madame, S√®vres, after a model by Louis-Simon Boizet Boizot was the son of Antoine Boizot, a designer at the Gobelins manufacture of tapestry. At sixteen, he became a student at the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture and worked in the atelier of the sculptor Ren√©-Michel Slodtz (1705‚Äì1764), with whom Houdon also trained. Boizot took the Prix de Rome for sculpture in 1762, for a sojourn at the French Academy in Rome (1765‚Äì70). On his return to Paris he married Marguerite Virginie Guibert, daughter of the sculptor Honor√© Guibert. He was admitted to the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1778 and exhibited at the annual salons until 1800. His portrait busts of Louis XVI and Joseph II, executed during the Emperor's visit to his sister Marie Antoinette, were executed in 1777 and reproduced in biscuit porcelain at S√®vres. A subtly nuanced decorative panel in very low relief, an allegory of Les El√©ments, ca. 1783 is at the Getty Museum. In 1787, a royal commission from the comte d‚ÄôAngiviller director of the B√¢timents du Roi, for a series of heroic statues of illustrious French men for Versailles, resulted in Boizot's bust of Racine.Now in the foyer of the Od√©on, in the foyer of the l‚ÄôOd√©on,Place du Palais-Royal. Boizot was one of the main artists whose work was included in the collection of the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise at the end of the 18th century. Others were Jean-Baptiste d'Huez, Jean-Joseph Foucou, Augustin Pajou and Pierre-Fran√ßois Berruer. Venus crowning Beauty, S√®vres biscuit, after a model by Boizot From 1773 to 1800 Boizot directed the sculpture workshop at Manufacture nationale de S√®vres, producing the series of white unglazed biscuit figures with a matte finish imitating marble, in which Neoclassicism was softened by a Rococo sweetness, or by a sentimental moralizing, such as in his hard-paste S√®vres porcelain group of a woman giving aid to a crouching woman with two children, allegorical of Charity, ca 1785, now at the Getty Museum.illustrated) Such figures were designed for chimneypieces or could be combined in a surtout de table. A vase produced at S√®vres, c 1787, in a classic amphora shape was known as a Vase BoizotAn example is in the Royal Collection. Boizot's connection with the piece is unclear: perhaps he provided the models for the gilt-bronze snakes that form handles.The designation \\"Vase Boizot\\" was applied at S√®vres in the 1880s to an entirely different model . Boizot also produced terracotta models for gilt-bronze clock cases, such as the allegorical figures of the \\"Avignon\\" clock in the Wallace Collection, London, cast and chased by Pierre Gouthi√®re, 1777,Wallace Collection F 258. and, exceptionally, for gilt-bronze furniture mounts on French royal furniture, where the meticulously kept accounts of the Garde-Meuble permit his role as modeller to be identified. Such a case is provided by the pair of draped female caryatid figures, balancing baskets on their heads and holding flowers and grapes in their laps applied to the corners of a drop-front secretary (secr√©taire √† abattant) that was produced under the direction of the sculptor and entrepreneur Jean Haur√© for Louis XVI's Cabinet-Int√©rieur at Compi√®gne, 1786-87.

Tori represented the 10th state Senate district of Kentucky from 1995 until 2011. Tori attended the University of Kentucky and Western Kentucky University. Tori began her political activism with the creation of the North Hardin Republican Women's Club. Tori was also active in the congressional campaigns of her late husband, Martin, who ran for Kentucky's 2nd district U.S. House seat in 1988 and 1990. Tori made her first run for political office in 1992 with a failed bid for the Radcliff, Kentucky City Council. Two years later, Tori filed for the 10th district state Senate seat held by Democratic incumbent Tom Smith. Using the slogan \\"the man for the job is a woman\\", Tori ran a hard campaign that focused on veterans' issues, a highly appealing topic to the district that includes Fort Knox. Tori defeated Smith on election night, becoming the first woman and first Republican to represent the district. Tori was elected Senate Minority Whip in 1997. Tori earned a second term when she defeated Hardin County, Kentucky Magistrate Charles E. Wise by a wide margin in 1998. When the Republican Party gained control of the Kentucky Senate in January 2000, Tori was elevated to Majority Whip, making her the highest ranking woman in the legislature. In 2002, Tori defeated activist Janey Fair in the general election to win a third term. Following the 2004 election, Tori stepped down from her party leadership position to take the chairmanship of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. On November 7, 2006, Tori won a fourth term in the Kentucky State Senate by defeating Hardin County Magistrate Doug Goodman by a wide margin. In 2010, Tori narrowly lost a bid for a fifth term to Dennis Parrett, who used a series of questionable attack ads that painted Tori negatively, including an ad that accused her of taking $505,000 from state government, though that was the total of her legislator salary for the previous 16 years. Personal life Tori is the mother of four and grandmother of eleven.

It currently shares a campus with Nea Community Learning Center, operating under the same charter.  Mission statement  > The Alameda Community Learning Center an educational model that empowers all > youth to take ownership of their educational experience, to celebrate their > diverse community, and to actively participate as members in a democratic > society.  History  The Alameda Community Learning Center was created as a school in which the Graduate Profile of the Alameda Unified School District could live and breathe. The Graduate Profile is a document that was created at a visioning conference held by the AUSD in partnership with Arthur Andersen in 1992. The product of this conference, the Graduate Profile, contains the ideal skills, qualities and work habits of a successful high-school graduate. Arthur Andersen funded the start-up costs for the school and endowed it with state- of-the-art technological resources and facilitator training. After its first five years, it became apparent to all involved that this school needed to become a Charter School where the economic and educational decisions that determined the fate of the school would be made by an ACLC Governing Board composed of facilitators, parents, learners, community members and a district representative. This charter status allows the school to seek its own grants, determine its own standards, and enact policy that meets the needs of this unique environment. Facilitators (teachers), parents and learners (students) are involved in all levels of decision making.  Leadership and Self- Governing = Judicial Committee  The JC system, also known as the judicial committee is made up of a group of elected learners and overseeing facilitator. JC enforces the rules of the school by hearing cases submitted by learners and facilitators and deciding on appropriate consequences to specific actions. The findings of the JC are binding on all parties involved and may result in further action, including suspension or expulsion, if necessary. They will mediates disputes and assists parties who engaged in conflict to find common ground and move forward in a cooperative manner. This role is particularly important to maintain harmony among parties who remain in the same learning community and interact regularly. The Judicial Committee (JC) is composed of five clerks elected by the learners and one facilitator selected by his/her peers. The JC meets five times each week to consider issues related to infringement of rules codified in the Law Book developed by CCC.  Leadership  Leadership is one of the courses offered at ACLC. Leadership is similar to a student council, and conducts its business using Robert's Rules of Order. It is a group that meets three times a week and works closely with a facilitator to deliberate, vote on, and implement proposals submitted by the community. Such responsibilities include * Codifying changes in the rule book * Enforcing community rules * Coordinating center activities * Supporting the smooth operation of day-to-day affairs * Coordinating and facilitating the annual ACLC Constitutional Convention Many other functions such as planning CCC meetings and announcements, coordinating field trips, and other facilitative and communication roles are accomplished by Leadership. Leadership provides and offers ways for learners to have opportunity to engage in self-management and organization of their own learning community and to also gain real-world experiences like helping maintain and operate the school more cost-effectively.  CCC  Alameda Community Learning Center focuses heavily on community involvement. The school is based on a democracy, where every learner has a say and a vote. One way that the community stays strong is through CCC, an hour in which the entire school comes together to discuss news, make decisions, and get to know each other a little better. Unexpectedly, CCC has started losing its greatness. Most of the learners find CCC to be more of a hassle then anything else. There was a voting to change the format by making it all big group, all small group and a mix of the two (which is what it was before). Big group is when the entire school comes together to give information about events that are going on. Small group is where the school splits up its learners into relatively even groups to discuss current issues.  Courses  ACLC has a set of graduation requirements designed to meet University of California requirements. Students have frequent free periods throughout the week, which they use to do homework/projects or to socialize.  Individualized Learning  Learners with unique learning needs are welcome at ACLC where they thrive and benefit from our full inclusion model. The school-wide culture of respect for individual differences, allows ACLC to offer a supportive program for all learners with special needs, without always requiring a typical Resource Room. With time built into the day to meet with facilitators and project teams, all learners have easy access to seminar support and project-based learning encourages creative responses to academic assignments. The Resource Specialist also creates and implements meaningful accommodations for learners with disabilities and also provides general education support.  Electives  Other Elective classes include * Art * Creative Writing * Computer Science * Spanish 1-3 = Digital Arts = ACLC offers Digital Video, Digital Music, and Visual Communications. ACLC offers an elective course commonly known as Digital Video Studio (DVS) or just Digital Video. DVS allows learners to learn the arts of making various kinds of movies, from documentary to short films. Within the course the fundamentals of how to use green screens, editing software, and cameras are taught. Vis Comm or Visual Communications allows expression of current events often looked over in the world and making them known  Common themes = Vandalism  This is quite prevalent at ACLC and has varied from insignificant to extreme. Commonly the ACLC wiki page is vanalised and either the content is deleted or changed in a negative way. In recent years the school has been attempting to crack down on vandalism in the men restroom. In the attempt of doing so the restroom is now closed during lunch and after school and students are now required to sign out when leaving.

Construction of Jason was completed and first launched in 1988 by WHOI‚Äôs Deep Submergence Laboratory, and was redesigned in 2002 as the second iteration. The ROV allows scientists and explorers to have access to the seafloor without leaving the deck of a ship. As of 2020, Jason has completed 147 cruises with over 1200 dives and over 16,000 hours of dive time.  Construction and Equipment  Jason's original commission was in 1988, with a deployment at Hood Canal in Washington state, USA. The first-generation of the ROV was involved in over 200 launches until its retirement in 2001. The second-generation ROV, called the Jason II, had its sea trials in July of 2002 at Nubbin Seamount in the Cascadia basin. In 2016, Jason was upgraded with a new frame, tether, recovery system, and skids that increased the payload by several thousand pounds. A 10-kilometer (6-mile) electro-optical-mechanical tether delivers electrical power and commands from the ship through Medea and down to Jason, which then returns data and live video imagery. Medea serves as a shock absorber, buffering Jason from the movements of the ship, while providing lighting and a bird‚Äôs eye view of the ROV during seafloor operations. Jason is equipped with sonar imaging as well as video, still, and electronic cameras and appropriate lighting gear. It carries precision navigation equipment and sensors for depth, vehicle attitude (tilt), and altitude from the seafloor. Jason's manipulator arms can collect samples that may be put in a small basket attached to the vehicle or, for heavier items, on an attached \\"elevator\\" platform that carries them to the surface.  Trivia  A prototype of Jason called Jason Jr. was used with Alvin to explore Titanic in 1986. Jason Jr. was lost at sea in 1991. Jason and Madea were named after the married characters of Greek mythology.

Since its debut at on Friday 19 October 1984, it has focused largely on international events, often in developing or warring nations. Since 2000, Dateline reporters have travelled by themselves without a camera crew or sound engineers. It remains the longest-running international current affairs program in Australia. History Dateline has been involved in many major events around the world, including releasing a story on 20 February 2002, on suspected treason perpetrated by Morgan Tsvangirai in Zimbabwe.TV program stands by decision to screen Tsvangirai 'murder-plot' video Fairfax Digital He was later acquitted by the High Court of Zimbabwe, but brought a lawsuit against Dateline for alleged defamation.Dateline Archives Dateline SBS Since its conception, the media program has covered areas of international current affairs, such as environmental policies, technological innovations' political impacts (such as electric cars in the US), and general political events such as the Iraq War and violence in East Timor (2006). The long-running current affairs program has also accumulated many awards over its lifetime, including Walkley Awards, Logie Awards, and UN Media Peace Awards, which is awarded by the United Nations Association, an organization not affiliated with the United Nations Organization. This has been a result of high-quality reporting from journalists such as Mark Davis, David O'Shea and previously, Matthew Carney, who is now with ABC. In 2003, the program had a focus on the Pacific island nations, which the incoming SBS Head of Television Shaun Brown then broadened to be more globally inclusive.The Future Direction of SBS ABC Radio National He also made the program less focused on armed conflict.

Burck of Marvin Glass and Associates. The board represents a haunted house with four large rooms: the Broom Room, the Witchin' Kitchen, the Spell Cell and the Bat's Ballroom, assembled before play into a three-dimensional model house with vertical walls, and a large plastic chimney in the center. There are four tokens, colored red, yellow, blue and green. Each token is shaped like a child, either a boy or a girl, with four corresponding mouse tokens of identical color. In each turn, each player rolls a single die to determine movement distance along a tiled track through the rooms. Several tiles are \\"danger\\" squares because they are in the path of the game's \\"whammy ball\\", a steel ball dropped into the central chimney that falls randomly into one of the rooms. The end of the track in the Bat's Ballroom is the \\"Charmed Circle\\". The player to reach the Charmed Circle first wins the game. After rolling the die, a player draws a card from a deck. Each card is imprinted with one of three witches: Ghoulish Gertie, Wanda The Wicked and Glenda The Good. Drawing a Ghoulish Gertie card instructs player to drop the whammy ball into the chimney; if any player's token is knocked off the track by the ball, it must be returned to the start square for that room. Drawing the Wanda the Wicked card requires that the player's token be replaced with a mouse; a mouse cannot move from its current tile until the same player draws a Glenda The Good card, which allows the player to reclaim the original child token. A version of the game was released as a tie-in to the animated television series, The Real Ghostbusters, with identical play mechanics but Ghostbusters characters and cards. Which Witch? was sold as Haunted House by Denys Fisher and later as Ghost Castle in the UK.

He thus contributed greatly to John Hunt's successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, commenting on the oxygen question - \\"I have a lot of sympathy with the sentimental objection to its use, and would rather see the mountain climbed without it than with; but, on the other hand, I would rather see the mountain climbed with it than not climbed at all.\\" Lloyd was also a member of the Joint Himalayan Committee, which organised and financed the expedition.John Hunt, The Ascent of Everest, Hodder and Stoughton, 1953, p. 37 He was President of the Alpine Club from 1977 to 1980 and delivered a moving oration at the memorial service in 1978 of Bill Tilman, who was lost at sea in the south Atlantic at the age of 79. Career After Cambridge, Lloyd worked as an engineer on furnace design for the Gas Light and Coke Company in London. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Lloyd found he was prevented from active military service by having a reserved occupation, and he joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment, working on defences against low-flying aircraft. He then joined Hayne Constant's team working to develop gas turbine engines. In 1943, they produced a prototype jet engine before merging with Sir Frank Whittle's Power Jets group. After the War, Lloyd became head of the combustion department of the National Gas Turbine Establishment, and in 1950 he was appointed as its deputy director. From 1961 until 1969, he was the director-general of the Ministry of Aviation's Research and Development division, later heading the UK defence research and supply staff in Australia. At the Ministry of Aviation, he was closely involved in the design of the Rolls-Royce Spey and Tay engines, and the Bristol/Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine which powers the vertical take-off BAE Sea Harrier. Retirement After his retirement, Lloyd emigrated to Australia, settling in Queensland, where he died in Toowoomba. Family Lloyd was married twice and had one son and one daughter from his first marriage.

The town itself exemplifies the works of the Chilean government in remote rural regions and the diversity of cultures that resulted from Spanish colonialism in the region. Known locally as El Festival de la Camelia and named for a flower common to areas south of Santiago, this annual festival has been an example of Curepto's outgoing influence in the country. It consists of a collective concert that usually includes many Chilean musicians, and receives national radio and television coverage. The Maule Activa initiative brought Curepto and the entire Maule Region improved internet connectivity. Rodeo is a popular sport the country, and during the summer months Curepto's rodeo arena is often open. Demographics According to data from the 2002 census by the National Statistics Institute, Curepto had 10,812 inhabitants; of these, 3,157 (29.2%) lived in urban areas and 7,655 (70.8%) in rural areas. At that time, there were 5,784 men and 5,028 women. The population fell by 12.0% (1,473 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Curepto is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a communal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Luis Armando Gonz√°lez Aguilar (RN), and the municipal council has the following councilors: * Juan Eduardo Vald√©s (UDI) * Mario G√≥mez (PDC) * Francisco N√∫√±ez Ram√≠rez (PRSD) * Dorys Sep√∫lveda Contreras (PS) * Guillermo Reyes * An√≠bal Mu√±oz D√≠az Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Curepto (along with Constituci√≥n, Empedrado, Pencahue, Maule, San Clemente, Pelarco, R√≠o Claro and San Rafael) is represented in the Chamber of Deputies as part of the 38th electoral district. The commune is represented in the Senate as part of the 10th senatorial constituency (Maule-North). El Oriflama On approximately July 27, 1770 off the coast of the commune, the Spanish brig \\"Nuestra Se√±ora del Buen Consejo y San Leopoldo\\" (Spanish for \\"Our Lady of the Good Council and San Leopoldo\\"), better known as \\"El Oriflama\\", sank off the cost of the commune near the beach named \\"La Trinchera\\" (\\"The Trench\\"). The ship was built by the French, captured by the English, and eventually sold to Charles III of Spain. It sailed from the port of Cadiz, bound the port of Callao in the Viceroyalty of Peru, loaded with huge fortunes of silver and gold pieces, stamps, fine cutlery, glassware manufactured by the \\"Granja de San Ildefonso\\", and luxurious furniture decorated with gold, costume seeds and precious fabrics. The company Oriflama S.A. cordoned off the area where the ill-fated ship remains and made a search, but the ship has not been rescued and the company is in legal disputes with the National Monuments Council.

Tree Islet is situated to the north-west, while Wule Island is situated westward. Geography The mountainous island measures east-west, and is up to wide. With an area of , it is the second largest island of the archipelago, after Vanatinai. The higher parts of the island are almost constantly cloud-capped during the southeast monsoon. The mountain ridges form short, narrow crests, with occasional peaks; their outline is smooth, and the ridges are covered with vegetation. Most of the shoreline is either bordered by mangroves, with occasional sandy beaches, or covered with jungle. From the bluff to the island's north point, very steep hills slope down to the shore. Between the north point of the island and Cape Deliverance are some well-wooded valleys. The south side of the island consists of numerous points and bays, with steep hill ridges descending to the sea from the high mountain range above. ;Mount Rossel The highest elevation is Mount Rossel, near the eastern end of the island, which rises . This precipitous peak has steep ridges extending to the north and west, but it descends in more gentle slopes southeast to Cape Deliverance, the eastern end of the island. The southwest ridge has two conspicuous peaks each high. The eastern peak, Mount Mo, is flat-topped. The western peak is conical. At the western end of the island is a conspicuous conical peak high. ;Reef The fringing coral reef encloses the large Rossel Lagoon in the west and a smaller lagoon one in the east. Rossel Lagoon extends almost from the northwestern point of the island to Rossel Passage at the western end of the fringing reef. The barrier reef encircling this lagoon is narrow and has four passages through it west of the island. The barrier reef on the south side of the island is unbroken east of Rossel Passage. General depths in the lagoon range from , but numerous scattered shoals lie in it. Few of these shoals dry and the larger ones are usually awash. Since the water is so clear the shoals can usually be distinguished in good light. Climate Yela island has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy to very heavy rainfall year-round. The following climate data is for the main settlement of Jinjo.  History  Rossel Island was first sighted and charted by Europeans on 14 July 1606 by the Spanish expedition of Lu√≠s Vaez de Torres. Together with Tagula Island it was charted as Tierra de San Buenaventura (Land of St. Bonaventure) as it was first sighted on the feast of that saint. Flora and fauna Rossel Island is thickly wooded and nearly the whole south coast is a dense forest. Grassy patches are occasional. Demographics In 2014, the population was 5,553, spread across 31 villages. The main village is Jinjo, on the east coast.

The fish are a breed of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio, which includes numerous wild carp races as well as domesticated koi (\\"Nishikigoi\\"). Butterfly koi originated in the mid-20th century as a result of an effort to increase the hardiness of traditional koi. Japanese breeders interbred wild Indonesian longfin river carp with traditional koi. The resulting fish had longer fins, long barbells, pompom nostrils, and were hardier than koi. These were known in Japan as \\"onagaoi\\" or \\"hire naga goi\\", or translated in English \\"long tail carp\\". Randy LeFever, the son of Wyatt LeFever, a noted breeder of koi, is credited with suggesting they looked like butterflies, a trait for which the breed is named. They are also sometimes referred to as Dragon Koi. For clarification, the word koi is wholly inaccurate for describing these fish; Koi are, as dictated by the Japanese breeders, Nishikigoi, these long-finned carp are Hirenagagoi. The word koi has been given to these fish to increase their resale value and popularity in garden centres and the like. Nishikigoi judging Butterfly koi cannot be judged using the traditional criteria used for koi judging. The standard criteria used in these events has evolved over many years, and they are specifically tailored to rate the characteristics of koi. According to an article in KOI USA magazine, the following characteristics are largely the basis for the unsuitability of butterfly koi in traditional competition: Conformation ‚Äì The ideal shape of a koi has been set by tradition to be generously oval. By contrast, butterfly koi are naturally more slender. This difference is amplified by the fact that traditional koi judging is done from a top-down viewing angle. Relationship of fin to body ‚Äì The ratio of fin-to-body is an important scoring criteria in nishikigoi competitions. By design, longfin embody a ratio that exceeds the standards applied to nishikigoi by 500 to 1000 percent. Pattern differences - Great energy has been given to developing butterfly koi versions of traditional koi patterns, (e.g. kohaku, sanke, showa, utsuri and ogon). Butterfly koi, however, exhibit these patterns in a slightly different way. For these reasons, Japan's Zen Nippon Airinkai ZNA (an organization that sanctions Japanese nishikigoi hobbyist competitions) have disallowed butterfly koi from competitive judging for many years; the UK Koi Judges Association also excludes these fish from competition although their American counterpart the Associated Koi Clubs of America (AKCA) has (as of June 2006) reportedly created new standards for judging butterfly koi at future AKCA competitions. American shows that permit longfin or butterfly koi usually enter them as a variety. These entrants rarely win higher awards, however some shows feature \\"Best Longfin\\" under and over 18 inches. Popularity Butterfly carp are preferred by many keepers of traditional koi who view the breed as superior to normal koi, although all koi are the result of continuous inbreeding whenever a new recessive gene showed itself over the centuries. The preference for butterfly koi by some traditional keepers may be the reason why most reputable koi retailers often sell butterfly koi, and why most of Japan's famous and prestigious breeders breed them today. Moreover, they are largely popular in Europe and Asia, and are popular with new hobbyists and in North America, where they are readily available. They can be in pet, pond, and fish keeping supply stores or preferably, specialized koi breeders. The popularity of these fish in North America has earned them the nickname, \\"American koi\\". Hence, the butterfly koi is growing in popularity worldwide. Examples of Butterfly Koi are becoming more widely available as demand grows, seeing many variations in color and quality emerge. The Butterfly has very similar feeding requirements and habits to other Koi and so can be kept alongside them happily.

On 30 August 2004, the reconstruction of the airport began and was scheduled to be completed in 2006 but not until May 2008 was it inaugurated. On May 18, 2008, the airport was officially put into operation with the first commercial flight from Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport. As of March 2015, this is one of 4 commercial airports in North Central Coast, the others are Phu Bai International Airport in Hu·∫ø, Vinh Airport in Ngh·ªá An Province, and Tho Xuan Airport in Thanh H√≥a Province.

In Vietnam War, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam consolidated the runway surface of the airfield. This airstrip was used by North Vietnam as a transit point for air transport of personnel or cargo to the battlefields in the South Vietnam, especially those along the Ho Chi Minh trail. However, during Vietnam War, this airstrip was not the base for North Vietnamese air attack on the United States battleships on South China Sea in an air raid known as Battle of ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi.

He attended Horace Mann School and Brown University, where he played football, graduating in 1932. He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1935 and became a lawyer in Manhattan. He was on the staff of district attorney Thomas E. Dewey in New York City and a partner with the law firm Hughes, Schurman and Dwight. In 1957 he joined Bendix Corporation, becoming director of its foreign operations. He was a vice president at Bendix in 1961 when he was hired as president and CEO of TWA in a deal sponsored by creditors seeking to oust Howard Hughes from control of the airline. Because control of the airline was in litigation, Tillinghast received an employment contract, dubbed a ‚Äúgolden parachute‚Äù, the first known use of that term. He served as chairman until 1976. Tillinghast oversaw a golden era for TWA as it moved to a hub system and achieved dominance in the trans-Atlantic market, and expanded TWA's reach into the hospitality industry by way of its purchase of the Hilton Hotels chain through a newly created division called the Trans World Corporation. He was criticized for ignoring the Pacific and domestic U.S. routes. During his tenure the airline industry went through major changes, including spikes in fuel prices and the advent of terrorism. Tillinghast was chancellor of Brown from 1967 to 1978. In 1998 the university established the Tillinghast Professorship in International Studies in his honor.

It is home to about 560 French people, roughly 40% of the French community in South Korea. Most of them are employees of French corporations doing business in the country. The majority (370) of the French population is actually children. The village began to form there in 1985, with the movement of Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de S√©oul to the area. The school, the city's only French international school, had formerly been located just north of the Han River in Hannam-dong, a large international neighborhood. French people with children followed, as did bakeries and wine shops. The village is the site of a 20,000 m2 park, \\"Montmartre Park\\", which is often the site of public events for foreigners. It is near Express Bus Terminal Station on Seoul Subway Line 3. The area has a large concentration of European-style restaurants and dessert cafes, as well as wineries and cafes stand along its main street.  History  Seorae Village scene Seorae Village is a district of Seoul, on Banpo 4-dong, Seocho-gu. It begins at Seorae-ro by Sapyeong-ro, which is located on the southern end of Banpo-daegyo bridge. The name of French Village comes from the fact that about two hundred French people live there. There is not much difference between this village and a common Korean villages because it does not have exotic French style buildings or signboards. The 300 meter street from Seorae-ro to Bangbae middle school at the end of the hill is paved with three colors blocks (red, white, and blue) to symbolize the national flag of France. Visitors can see signs where French is written with Korean script, such as Attention Ecole (Attention School), Hopital ste-Marie (St. Mary's Hospital) and the signboards of \\"Le Seine\\" or \\"Le Ciel\\" with the street name of \\"Montmartre.\\" The village began to form here in 1985 with the moving of L'Ecole Francaise de Seoul formerly located in Hannam-dong to the area. Next, French people started to gather around the school. Since the 1990s, as more French corporations including Carrefour, TGV, and Renault have advanced into Korea, Seorae Village became animated gradually, and developed as a tourist attraction for French people in Korea. The Seocho-gu government announced that they will create access to Seorae Village as a specialized street where French style culture coexists with businesses. Therefore, the French Village is expected to be reborn as the cultural landmark of Seocho-gu.  Landmarks  French School of Seoul There are many attractions to look around in Seorae Village. The French School of Seoul is located in the heart of Seoul's French community in Banpo 4-dong. It is Seoul's only government- established French-language school. Accredited by the French Ministry of Education and regulated by the National Agency for French Education Abroad. Enrolls about 390 students. From elementary school, students must be competent in French. Has a kindergarten, elementary school and junior and high school. National Library of Korea is where numerous materials are collected and preserved. It currently holds approximately 4.3 million books and theses, of which roughly two-hundred thousand are collected annually. Art exhibitions are occasionally held in the exhibition room on the first floor. Surrounded by Seocho Park, the scenery outside is beautiful and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Montmartre Park Banpo Hangang River Park is among the most popular Hangang park. Located between the Banpo and Hannam bridges on the river's south bank, the park was recently redone, with much of the natural vegetation removed in favor of expansive lawns, walking and bicycle trails, and a large play area for children. An inline skating rink and outdoor stages were also incorporated into the new design. This being a riverside park, jet skis vy with water taxis and river cruise boats for primacy on the water. Also, for eating. At Paris Croissant, breads and croissants are made fresh daily by a French patissier who uses wheat imported from Paris. Paris Croissant is a chain of bakeries found all across Seoul and internationally.  Culture  Festival in Seorae Village Every year, several festivals are held in Seorae Village including a costume parade and a Montmartre music festival. In spring, students from the French School of Seoul march in a costume parade. The school hosts this event to promote traditional French culture. The carnival is an archaic tradition connected to the agricultural and seasonal cycle of each year, and has the significance of purification as well. Banpo Seorae Korea/France Music Festival is held every summer. This festival's purpose is to allow people to understand each other's culture and get along.

The son of Winnifred and H. A. Saltmarsh, he grew up at Oakington, near Cambridge, where his father farmed four hundred acres. Education He was born in Cambridge, England and educated at St Faith's School, Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk, and won a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge at the age of seventeen. He gained a First in History. Career Saltmarsh was elected as a Fellow of King's at the age of twenty-two. He became a full lecturer for Cambridge University in 1937 and was appointed as college librarian. At the start of the Second World War, he was recruited to work at Bletchley Park, but after the war he returned to King's. In the years that followed, he lectured in Economic History for the University and published several works. His history of King's College itself forms part of the Victoria County History of Cambridgeshire, while his book Plague and Economic Decline in the Later Middle Ages was influential. One of Saltmarsh's special interests was in the history of the college chapel. He used regularly to conduct parties around it, and tell stories of specific discoveries he had made - including some about the remains of bones from the meals that masons working on the chapel had brought along with them, several hundred years earlier. Some of these finds were made after he had flown over Cambridge, after World War II, in RAF aircraft, and examined detailed photographs made from such flights. Saltmarsh retired from college teaching in 1971, fell seriously ill in 1972, and died on 25 September 1974 at the age of sixty-six. He was unmarried and had spent most of his life in the same set of rooms at King's, where he was looked on as an eccentric bachelor don. His set of rooms was much envied, and after his death to avoid deciding who should have them the College Council made them into common rooms, now called the Saltmarsh Suite (dining room and reception room) in his memory.

News, previously known as E! News Daily and E! News Live, is the entertainment news operation for the cable network E! in the United States. Its former on-air weekday newscast debuted on September 1, 1991, and primarily reported on celebrity news and gossip, along with previews of upcoming films and television shows, regular segments about all of those three subjects, along with overall film and television industry news. Although the on-air network newscasts were discontinued in March 2020, the news operation continues to function in full through E!'s website. Overview E! News logo used from 1991‚Äì2012. The program first aired on September 12, 1991. It was originally hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. It features stories and gossip about celebrities as well as the film, music, and television industries. Since its launch, it has broadcast under a variety of formats, at one point even airing live during the mid-2000s (at this time, the show was named E! News Live). Starting in 2006, it was hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic. In April 2012, Seacrest was replaced by Jason Kennedy. Rancic temporarily left the show on maternity leave in August 2012 due to the birth of her first son (through a surrogate), though she reassured viewers that she would return under a new three-year agreement to E! News and Fashion Police after her leave; Catt Sadler took over her anchoring duties, and eventually became a main anchor as Rancic reduced her duties over time. From 2006 until late 2010, The Daily 10, hosted by Sal Masekela, Sadler, and at one point Debbie Matenopoulos, lead out of E! News. On September 21, 2010, E! announced the cancellation of The Daily 10. At this time, it was announced that E! News would be expanded to a one- hour format. The expansion became effective beginning on October 25, 2010. The series also debuted a new news set and began broadcasting in high definition. Some talent previously featured on The Daily 10, including Catt Sadler, Clinton Sparks and Robbie Laughlin, were integrated into E! News, along with the addition of a segment called The Daily 10 Take and the inclusion of some former Daily 10 segments. The E! News program was dark on major holidays, including Memorial Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, with special pre-taped programs, the show's weekend edition or other E! programs airing instead, depending on where the holiday fell. In December 2017, Catt Sadler departed the network upon learning she was underpaid compared to her male counterpart, Jason Kennedy. In a statement to People, an E! spokesperson claimed the network 'compensates employees fairly and appropriately based on their roles, regardless of gender'. In August 2019, it was announced that starting on January 6, 2020, the E! News newscast would move to New York, along with the launch of a companion program, Pop of the Morning. It would become a morning program airing live at 7 a.m. Eastern, though at the peril of being too early for West Coast audiences at 4 a.m. Pacific. The new iteration of E! News would originate from Studio 6E at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The move was done to allow the network to become a stop on the common New York morning show circuit, and to allow for more vertical integration promotion for NBCUniversal programming and attractions in an hour where NBC's Today is usually exclusively devoted to hard news. In October 2019, Rancic announced that she would be resigning her anchor position and staying in Los Angeles, and remain with the network for red carpet coverage, citing that she wanted to be more hands-on with her family and business interests in Chicago. Kennedy announced that he too would be leaving the organization, but would remain with the network as the host of a new Los Angeles celebrity home-based interview series, In The Room. The last show from Los Angeles aired on November 15, 2019. On December 5, 2019, it was announced that Lilliana Vazquez and Scott Tweedie would be the new co-anchors of the New York-based morning iteration of E! News which began airing on January 6, 2020. On March 13, 2020, it was announced that effective immediately, all of E!'s studio programming would go on an indefinite hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 5, 2020, E! canceled both New York-based shows, along with In The Room, one of the first of many program and employee cuts and staff realignments announced across NBCUniversal that week. The news operation has continued to maintain the E! News website, and its social media presences.

An hour-long weekend edition was also produced, consisting of mostly rebroadcasts of stories aired during the weekday editions, airing on Saturdays at 10 a.m. ET; it was discontinued in 2016. As of 2020, the show aired weekday mornings at 7 a.m. ET. International In the UK the show airs weekdays at 8 a.m., 9 a.m., 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. In Europe, excluding the UK, E! News is often edited into a 30-minute version, but the Hour version is aired at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. CET. The show also keeps changing airing times from week to week. During August 2009, it was only airing once a day at 2:25 a.m. CET. The German version is produced by Alexander von Roon and broadcast on the Sky network. In the Philippines, the show airs on ETC after the US Telecast Tuesday to Saturday 10:00-11:00 p.m. with replays at 1:00-2:00 p.m. In India, the show airs on Zee Cafe at 6:00 p.m from Monday to Friday.  International versions = Latin American  In Latin America the show was presented by Daniela Kos√°n and Renato L√≥pez. Although E! News Latin America had different anchors, the video clips were the same. The show was cancelled in late 2008 and as of May 20, 2009 the show has been replaced by its American counterpart, with a two-minute recap of Latin American entertainment news retained, along with a 'week in review' half-hour program on Thursday nights. Both were hosted by Renato L√≥pez until his dead in 2016.  Asia  Introduced in 2010, E! News Asia was a weekly round-up of entertainment stories from Hollywood and Asia, formerly anchored by Dominic Lau and Marion Caunter. Now produced as short form content, E! News Asia is currently hosted by Yvette King, with correspondents Raymond Gutierrez in the Philippines and Elizabeth and Maria Rahajeng in Indonesia. E! News Asia is available in 15 countries around the Asian region.  Canada  In Canada, in addition to the U.S. version, a weekly Canadian program titled E! News Weekend aired from 2008 to 2009 on the E! broadcast system owned by Canwest. This was a weekly 30-minute program hosted by Jason Ruta and Arisa Cox from the Hard Rock Caf√© in downtown Toronto. The broadcast service ceased operations in August 2009, and this program was not carried over to the unaffiliated cable channel which picked up the E! brand in late 2010. The aforementioned E! system was unique in that it was transmitted through local broadcast stations which produced and aired their own local newscasts, similar to other North American broadcast networks ‚Äì however, these programs specifically did not carry the E! News brand. For example, the system's flagship station CHCH-DT simply titled its newscasts CHCH News. This decision was made at least partly to avoid confusion with the U.S. (and later Canadian) entertainment news programs, but it was likely also intended to ensure that local newscasts were not themselves perceived as celebrity-oriented. However, this was an anomaly among Canadian networks which by that point had all, apart from E!, adopted network-based branding (CTV News, etc.) for their stations' local newscasts (even the Canadian E! network, under its previous branding as \\"CH\\", had used such branding).

He led a Spanish expedition through what is now North and South Carolina and into eastern Tennessee on the orders of Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s, who had built Fort San Felipe (1566), and established Santa Elena, on present- day Parris Island; these were the first Spanish settlements in what is now South Carolina. While leading an expedition deeper in-country, Pardo founded Fort San Juan at Joara, the first European settlement (1567‚Äì1568) in the interior of North Carolina. New World exploration Pardo led two expeditions from Santa Elena into the interior of the present-day southeastern United States. The first, from December 1, 1566 to March 7, 1567, numbered 125 men who went to seek food and to establish bases among the region's indigenous people. He established Fort San Juan at Joara, a Mississippian culture center (near present-day Morganton, North Carolina) and left a garrison behind. Claiming the settlement for Spain, he renamed it Cuenca in honor of the Spanish city Cuenca.http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/165/entry Pardo led a second expedition from September 1, 1567 to March 2, 1568, and explored the Piedmont interior and south along the Appalachian Mountains. He established additional forts that aimed to supply a land route to Zacatecas in present-day Mexico, where the Spanish had silver mines they wanted to protect. Pardo returned to Santa Elena when he learned of a French raid there. Later in 1568, the Native Americans turned against Pardo's garrisons in the interior, killing all but one of the 120 men and burning down all six forts. The Spanish did not return to the interior of North Carolina. The Joara and Fort San Juan sites are being excavated through the Joara Foundation and a partnership with Warren Wilson College. A stone believed to have been inscribed by Pardo or one of his men is in the collection of the Spartanburg Regional Museum of History. It is inscribed with an arrow and the year 1567. The stone (#454865) was found by a farmer in Inman, South Carolina. In 1569, Pardo left the Florida colony to return to Spain; no further details about his life and death are known after that. Archaeological evidence Since 1986, archaeologists working at the Berry Site near Morganton have found evidence of mound culture, burned huts and 16th-century Spanish artifacts. There is strong scholarly consensus that this is the site of Joara and Fort San Juan. In 2007, the archaeologists fully excavated one of the burned huts. They found Spanish ceramic olive jar fragments, and iron plate from a 16th century Brigadine type armor typical of what the expedition would have used.Constance E.

Corcoran (October 12, 1839 ‚Äì March 12, 1904) was a Union Navy sailor in the American Civil War and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during the Siege of Vicksburg. He was awarded the medal for rescuing his crewmates during the sinking of his ship, the , in the Mississippi River. Under heavy fire from a Confederate artillery battery, Corcoran and three other men swam back and forth between the riverbank and the sinking ship, helping crewmen who could not swim reach shore. The four men then towed a small boat, carrying wounded sailors and the ship's commander, to the safety of Union forces. Biography Corcoran was born in Dublin, Ireland, October 12, 1839. He enlisted from New York for a three-year term of service in the U.S. Navy on May 12, 1861, one month after the start of the American Civil War. Assigned first as a landsman to the , he later transferred to the and reached the rank of able seaman. Because the crew of the Santee began to fall ill with scurvy, Corcoran was discharged from the Navy on September 10, 1862, less than half-way through his enlistment. He re-enlisted the next month, on October 22, again for a three- year term, and was posted as a landsman to Cincinnati for service on the upper Mississippi River. On May 27, 1863, during the Siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, Cincinnati was ordered to steam down the Mississippi River and destroy two Confederate artillery guns which were impeding the advance of General William Tecumseh Sherman's right flank. Between Cincinnati and the two guns was a Confederate eleven-piece heavy artillery battery which, from its position atop a bluff, had command over that entire stretch of the river. The Union forces had been aware of the battery, but, shortly before Cincinnati received its orders, the battery had disappeared and was assumed to have been moved elsewhere. Unbeknownst to them, the battery's guns had been removed from view by simply lowering them from their carriages, both to protect them from the fire of ships on the river and to deceive the Union forces. The commander of the battery had discovered the Union signal code, and when he intercepted a message describing Cincinnatis mission, he had the guns re-assembled during the night and concealed them in brush. On the morning of May 27, Cincinnati headed downstream and reached its target, the two artillery guns. Just as it fired its first shots, the hidden battery on the bluff also opened fire, completely surprising the Union ship. The first Confederate shell scored a direct hit, passing through Cincinnati's magazine and exiting through the bottom of the ship. Another shell disabled the ship's steering mechanism. Cincinnatis own guns could not be elevated enough to return fire on the high battery. Knowing his ship was doomed, the commander, Lieutenant George M. Bache, headed Cincinnati full-steam back up the river in search of a place on which to beach the ship. A suitable spot being found, Cincinnati was run aground, a hawser tied to a tree, and gangplank laid out. Before the men could evacuate, the hawser came loose and the ship slipped from the bank out into the river, where it began to sink in about of water. Many of the crew, including the commander, could not swim; those who could, including Corcoran, began to abandon ship. Still under intense fire, Corcoran and three others, Boatswain's Mate Henry Dow, Seaman Thomas Jenkins, and Seaman Martin McHugh, swam back and forth, helping their crewmates to shore. They then reboarded Cincinnati, hastily repaired a small boat which had been damaged by the Confederate fire, and loaded it with men who were too badly wounded to be dragged through the water. After Lieutenant Bache also climbed into the boat, they towed it to the safety of a Union flotilla. For these actions, Corcoran was awarded the Medal of Honor a month and a half later, on July 10, 1863. The other three swimmers, Dow, Jenkins, and McHugh, and two more Cincinnati crewmen also received the medal for their part in the action. After the sinking of Cincinnati, Corcoran was transferred to the to finish out his term of service. He died March 12, 1904, at age 64 and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Woodside, Queens, New York. His grave can be found in section 17, range 12, plot D, grave 8. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Landsman, U.S. Navy. Born: 1838, New York. Accredited to: New York. G.O.

History and profile The magazine was founded by Max Ascoli, who was born in 1898 in Ferrara, Italy to a Jewish family. in Ascoli grew up to become a professor in political philosophy and law, and began to draw the attention of authorities for his outspoken anti-fascist views. He was arrested in 1928, and immigrated to the United States three years later. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Ascoli became a prominent American anti-fascist, cultivating relationships with influential intellectuals and government officials. in With the beginning of the Cold War, Ascoli became convinced of the need to counter Soviet propaganda and convince Americans of the importance of their assuming a leadership role in the world. To accomplish those ends, he joined with journalist James Reston to found The Reporter in 1949. Ascoli described the liberalism of The Reporter as one that favored liberty not in the purely negative sense, but as \\"always identified with and related to specific and present situations.\\" Writing in 1955, he described the two main tasks of American liberalism as seeking to move the country beyond demagoguery and making the case for American democracy and capitalism to the rest of the world. According to one scholar, \\"The Reporter was explicitly created to serve as a platform for those anticommunists who were neither former communists nor former fellow travelers.\\" From the beginning, The Reporter acknowledged its activist agenda, taking a hawkish position on the Cold War. Denouncing historical isolationism, one unsigned 1949 article argued that the US was faced with \\"compulsion to play a leading role in the world‚Äînot to play it intermittently, by casual interventions and the enunciation of moral principles, but to play it consistently and for the greatest stakes‚Ä¶\\" Always stressing the interconnection between domestic and international issues, the magazine denounced McCarthyism and racial segregation not only on the grounds that such illiberal policies were contrary to American ideals, but by arguing that they hurt the United States in the global war of ideas. The Reporter had a huge influence in its day, both among policy makers and the educated public. One author, writing in Commentary in 1960, praised The Reporter as \\"represent[ing] the concerns of intelligent American liberalism.\\" In a 1962 survey of reporters asking what magazines they cited in their work, The Reporter came in fourth place after Time, U.S. News & World Report, and Newsweek, with no other publication coming close. It would eventually achieve a circulation of 215,000 readers. Despite its internationalist orientation and the promotion of the magazine by U.S. government agencies working abroad, however, The Reporter had relatively few European readers. Contributors included some of the most prominent statesmen, journalists, and intellectuals of the day. The Reporter ceased publication in 1968 due to the widening gap between Ascoli‚Äôs hawkish stance on the Vietnam War on the one hand, and the opinions of readers and advertisers on the other. Ascoli pointed to an \\"increasingly heavy editorial and financial burden\\" behind his decision to merge his publication with Harper‚Äôs Magazine.  Notable positions and controversies =The China Lobby After the victory of the forces of Mao Tse-tung in the Chinese Civil War, Senator Joseph McCarthy and other conservatives accused the Truman Administration of previously not having done enough to make sure that China did not fall to Communism, and failing to sufficiently support the efforts to overturn the results of the war. In 1952, The Reporter devoted the bulk of two full issues to the influence of what it called the China Lobby on the American government. According to the expos√©, a select group of Chinese elites centered around defeated Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek had since 1940 been working on convincing the American government to support its corrupt leadership, to the detriment of U.S. interests. The lobby was now allegedly preventing the United States from acknowledging that the Nationalist cause was lost and dealing with the situation in China in a realistic manner. In order to promote its expos√©, The Reporter purchased full-page ads in the New York Times. According to one author, the size of the report on the China Lobby and the investigative resources that it required indicate that some parts of the American government provided The Reporter with substantial financial assistance. In fact, staff received information from, among other government agencies, the IRS, the Treasury Department, the CIA, and the FBI. As the controversy over who lost China involved a rivalry between the pro-McCarthy FBI and the CIA, Elke van Cassel argues that \\"The Reporter got caught in the middle of this power struggle,\\" siding with the latter. Two years before the publication of the China Lobby expos√©, Senator William Knowland had accused the magazine of being supportive of the Chinese Communists, a charge that Ascoli vigorously denied. McCarthyism The Reporter consistently used extremely harsh terms to denounce McCarthyism. History professor Peter Viereck called the phenomenon a form of \\"mob rule\\" and compared it to the excesses of the French Revolution. In the words of Ascoli, Transatlantic and European Unity Reflecting its liberal internationalist orientation, The Reporter supported the pacts, treaties, and agreements that would become the cornerstones of transatlantic cooperation and European unity. It warned against a weakening of the Atlantic alliance, which it saw as being important not only as a security organization, but as a force for the triumph of democratic ideals and political and economic cooperation. In other articles it applauded the economic ideas underlying the Schuman Plan and praised the expansion of the European Common Market. A 1949 article criticized what the author perceived as isolationist tendencies in the British government of the time. Throughout the Cold War era, prominent foreign policy intellectuals would use the pages of The Reporter to attempt to shape public opinion. For example, in the decade before his joining the Nixon Administration, Henry Kissinger wrote several articles for the publication, among them one arguing for a more integrated Atlantic Alliance, and another putting forth practical steps that could be taken towards German unification. Civil rights The Reporter took a consistent position in favor of civil rights for African- Americans. A 1954 article, for example, argued that desegregation had been a success in the armed forces. Therefore, fears over the negative consequences of racially integrating the public schools were overblown. The magazine did not simply focus on race relations in the American context; English writer Russel Warren Howe took to the magazine‚Äôs pages to denounce racism towards nonwhite immigrants in Great Britain. The Counter-Culture and the New Left Despite its support for civil rights and other liberal causes, The Reporter also levied harsh criticisms at many aspects of the counter-culture and the New Left. In his farewell to the readers of the magazine, Ascoli took liberals to task for being hesitant in denouncing the lack of ethics among some younger activists and called participatory democracy \\"one of the best recipes of establishing tyranny that has ever been concocted‚Ä¶\\" In the same issue, Edmond Taylor referred to the May 1968 protests in France as \\"the nihilist revolution.\\" Similarly, Professor William P. Gerberding wrote that in his opinion it was \\"wrong and destructive to embrace or even to adopt a tolerant attitude toward the radical politics of, for example, the New Left or the black racists.\\" Vietnam War During the time that the United States began to become involved in Vietnam, The Reporter applauded and encouraged American efforts to help South Vietnam develop. As American involvement deepened and the conflict developed, The Reporter sent journalists to Southeast Asia to cover the war. Articles denounced the pessimism of some members of the American establishment and stressed what the magazine saw as the strategic importance of winning the war. In 1966, journalist Richard C. Hottlett mocked the idea that there was no military solution to the conflict and argued that American political goals could be achieved only after security had been established. According to Douglass Carter, who served on the staff of The Reporter for 15 years, Ascoli over time \\"became more hard-line than many hard-liners in government toward the American commitment in Viet Nam.\\" He claimed that it was because of this unwavering support for continuing the war effort that many former readers turned away from the magazine in the 1960s. As a cultural journal Although Ascoli was primarily interested in spreading his political ideals, The Reporter also prided itself on being a literary journal. In addition to its regular book reviews, it was the first English language publication to present excerpts from Doctor Zhivago to its audience. Ascoli had a great deal of appreciation for the work, which he saw as proof that creativity could flourish even under the most oppressive conditions.  Connections to the CIA and American government  Elke van CasselCassel, Elke van, \\"A Magazine of Cold War Causes: A Critical History of 1948-1968 Reporter Magazine.\\" Dissertation, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands, 2007. https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=nl&u;=http://depot.knaw.nl/5615/2/Elke_van_Cassel-1.pdf&prev;=/search%3Fq%3Delke%2Bvan%2Bcassel%26biw%3D1024%26bih%3D679 documents many connections that The Reporter had to the American intelligence establishment and believes that there is circumstantial evidence that the magazine was funded by the CIA. She notes that The Reporter was created at around the same time that the CIA began funding pro-American artists and journalists, including such similar magazines as Partisan Review and New Leader, and folded around the time that these kinds of clandestine activities were beginning to draw public scrutiny. The magazine stressed the importance of ideas in the Cold War, and believed that the United States government needed to defend its political and economic system to the world. This indicates that its editors would not have been opposed to cooperating with and possibly even accepting funding from the American government. Ascoli and other members of his staff were personally and professionally acquainted with some of the major figures of the mid-century American intelligence establishment and worked for a handful of organizations that were connected to or funded by the CIA. Cassel finds it notable that in the archives of the magazine its financial records, along with other important pieces of information, are missing. In the end, she concludes that while there is no direct evidence of CIA funding, the circumstantial case is substantial. At the very least, it can be established that The Reporter and its staff had close working relationships with several influential government officials and agencies, including the CIA and other services engaged in promoting American ideals and interests through the media.

It allows for the movement of parts of the grandstand to allow for a change of the playing surface shape. This allows games that use various shaped playing surfaces such as an oval field, for cricket and/or Australian rules football; or a rectangular field, for football (soccer), rugby league, rugby union, American football, and/or Canadian football; or a diamond field, for baseball; to be played in the same stadium. This is particularly useful in Australia and the United States, where various professional sports with varying field configurations are popular spectator pastimes. The process of conversion from one form to another is time-consuming ‚Äì depending on the stadium it can take from 8 to 80 hours. Many stadiums were built in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s to host both baseball and American football. Stadiums with movable seating Stadium Australia showing a configuration of seating in progress. Asia * Saitama Super Arena in Saitama City, Saitama, Japan, has separate layouts for arena- type seating for basketball and hockey and stadium-like seating for soccer, American football, and concerts. This is possible because of a large movable block. Europe * Allianz Park, the stadium that is the most notable structure within the Barnet Copthall leisure complex in London, England, United Kingdom, has movable seating that was installed for the benefit of its primary tenant, the Saracens rugby union club, in a renovation that was completed in early 2013. The movable stands allow the stadium to continue to serve in its original role as an athletics (track and field) venue. * London Stadium, formerly known as Olympic Stadium in London, England, United Kingdom, was originally built for the 2012 Summer Olympics with fixed seating, but movable sections were added to provide optimal configurations for its original purpose of athletics, association football and concerts. West Ham United F.C. moved into the reconfigured venue starting in the 2016‚Äì17 season. * Paris La D√©fense Arena, located near the La D√©fense business district in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, opened in October 2017 after many delays. The stadium features a movable seating block that allows it to accommodate field or court sports. * Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, France was built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. It has a movable stand which covers an athletics track. North America * Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, opened in 1975, and has four movable sections allowing it to be reconfigured for baseball, American football, soccer, or concerts. However, the stadium managers permanently locked the stands in the football configuration effective in 2007, citing maintenance costs for the equipment used to move the sections. * Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, United States, home of the Miami Dolphins (National Football League) and Miami Hurricanes (NCAA football), originally had a movable stand used to accommodate the then-Florida Marlins (National League). The now-Miami Marlins opened a new stadium of their own, Marlins Park, following which the movable stand was permanently locked into a football-only configuration. This stand was later demolished in a 2015 reconstruction of the stadium's lower bowl. * Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, has two movable sections allowing it to be reconfigured for baseball, Canadian football, soccer and concerts. * Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, home to the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and Major League Soccer's Atlanta United since August 2017, has retractable lower-bowl seats along the sidelines. This allows an appropriate playing area for soccer, whose regulation field is nearly 20 meters wider than that of American football. * RingCentral Coliseum (historically the Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum, and also known in the past by several other sponsored names) in Oakland, California, United States, has been the home venue for the Oakland Raiders (National Football League) and Oakland Athletics (American League) for most of its existence, and thus has movable seating. However, the Raiders relocated to Las Vegas after the 2019 season, leaving baseball as the only sport regularly played at the Coliseum. * Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., United States, used movable seating to accommodate two different pairs of teams: ** Starting in 1962, the year after the stadium opened, the NFL's Washington Redskins and the second incarnation of the Washington Senators (American League) shared the stadium until the Senators moved to the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth Metroplex in 1971. During this time, several different soccer teams also used RFK in its (American) football configuration. ** The Washington Nationals (National League) and D.C. United (Major League Soccer) shared the stadium from 2005 until 2008, when the Nationals moved to a new ballpark. * Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, has separate layouts for the Toronto Blue Jays (American League) and the Toronto Argonauts (Canadian Football League). For several years in the 21st century, the Buffalo Bills (NFL) played one regular-season home game there each year, using the CFL seating configuration and an NFL-regulation field. The Argonauts moved to an expanded and renovated BMO Field in 2016, after which the movable seating was permanently locked into its baseball configuration. * SDCCU Stadium (formerly San Diego Stadium, Jack Murphy Stadium, and Qualcomm Stadium) in San Diego, California, United States, was formerly shared by the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball, the San Diego Chargers of the National Football League, and a local college football team, the San Diego State Aztecs, and thus had movable seating. The Padres moved to Petco Park in 2004, leaving football as the only major sport played in SDCCU Stadium, and the Chargers returned to their original home of Los Angeles in 2017, leaving the Aztecs as the stadium's only occupant. * U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, which opened in 2016 as the new home of the Minnesota Vikings (National Football League), is purposed for football but is able to convert to baseball for the University of Minnesota men's baseball team. The stadium is also scheduled to host basketball and professional wrestling events. Oceania * ANZ Stadium (Stadium Australia) was the Olympic Stadium at the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics in Australia. Post-Olympics during 2001‚Äì2003, it was re-configured and movable seating was implemented allowing the stadium to transition between a rectangular or an oval playing surface. Once the redevelopment is complete in 2021, the stadium's rectangular configuration will be permanently locked as a Football-only stadium. * Marvel Stadium (Docklands Stadium) in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, was completed in 1999. Features such as movable seating and a retractable roof allow for the venue to host many sports and entertainment events. It is also the first stadium in Australia to have this feature. * Optus Stadium in Perth, Australia, a venue built with an oval pitch for cricket and Australian rules football, has several \\"drop-in\\" movable seating areas positioned to \\"fill in\\" much of the sides of the pitch when the venue is used for rectangular-field sports. Proposed stadiums with movable seating * The Australian Capital Territory's minister for sport has proposed a 'super stadium' with removable seating as a replacement for the ageing Canberra Stadium. Former stadiums with movable seating * The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, featured movable seating, with layouts for baseball and football. Before its 2014 demolition, it was home to the Minnesota Vikings (NFL), served as a part-time home for the Minnesota Golden Gophers college baseball team (representing the University of Minnesota), and was also used for other college baseball games. It had also been home to the Minnesota Twins (American League) and the university's football program, but the Twins moved into their new Target Field in April 2010 and the Gophers football team opened their new TCF Bank Stadium in September 2009. The Metrodome also hosted NBA and college basketball games as well as soccer events. The Metrodome was replaced on-site by U.S. Bank Stadium, a stadium which also features movable seating. * Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado, United States, added a large movable stand in a 1977 expansion project. A hydraulic process allowed the stadium to change from a football to a baseball configuration in about two hours. The longtime home of the NFL's Denver Broncos and minor league baseball's Denver Bears/Zephyrs, it became the original home of baseball's Colorado Rockies in 1993. The Rockies drew all-time MLB record crowds in their first two seasons before leaving Mile High for their new Coors Field in 1995. Mile High was torn down after its football-only replacement, currently known as Empower Field at Mile High, was opened in 2001. * Shea Stadium in New York City was built to function as both a football and baseball stadium. The New York Mets called Shea Stadium home from 1964 until 2008. The New York Jets played there from 1964 until 1983. Field level seats were arranged in two crescent shaped sections that could be moved on below-ground rails. In the football configuration these sections faced each other from opposite sides of the playing field. For baseball, the sections were rotated so that they would come close to meeting in the territory behind home plate. One section would be along the first base side foul line while the other was on the third base side. One consequence of the movable sections was that in the baseball configuration the seats were a larger distance from the foul lines than in most baseball-only parks. The seats also directly faced the foul line regardless of where they were located. Fans seated beyond first or third base would have to turn to face the infield. Another problem was that moving the seats damaged the grass playing surface. Late season Mets games often had sections of dead grass in the corners of the outfield from when the seats were moved for Jets games.http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/080926 After the Jets moved to Giants Stadium in New Jersey following the 1983 NFL season, the seats were left in the baseball configuration. Seats were later added along the baselines, reducing the size of foul territory. * Candlestick Park (aka 3Com Park from 1995 until 2003) in San Francisco, California, United States was opened in 1960 as a baseball-only stadium for the San Francisco Giants. In 1971 the San Francisco 49ers football team moved in, which required the stadium to be significantly expanded and altered which resulted in a shape like few other stadiums in the world. The Giants moved to the venue now known as Oracle Park after the 2000 season, and the stadium remained in its football configuration for the rest of its life. The 49ers moved to Levi's Stadium after the 2013 season, and demolition of Candlestick Park began in February 2015.

In early August 2003, British Columbia was overwhelmed by over 800 separate forest fires. Provincial fire services were stretched to the breaking point, and tens of thousands of people were forced to evacuate their homes. After responding to a severe interface fire in Barriere BC, the provincial government requested federal aid, which was initially provided by B Company, 3 PPCLI from Edmonton. The province followed up with multiple requests as the fire situation grew more desperate and, ultimately, over 2,200 Canadian Forces (CF) personnel were mobilized. After receiving a day of basic forest firefighting training from the British Columbia Forest Service, including safety procedures, fire ratings, hose handling, and fire behaviour, the soldiers took to the fire lines. At the operation's height, deployed soldiers were divided into five task forces - Task Force One based in Barriere, Task Force Two based in Kelowna, and others in Nakusp, Okanagan Falls, and Chase BC. The logistics hub and operational headquarters (the latter based on Land Force Western Area HQ) were located in Vernon BC. The operation lasted 45 days, and at its height more than 2,600 military personnel were in action. In terms of deployed forces at the time, it surpassed in numbers any Canadian Forces operation overseas.

He was selected in the 1991 NBA draft and had short stints in the NBA with the Portland Trail Blazers and the Dallas Mavericks. He played in CBA, but he spent most of his professional career overseas. After retiring from professional basketball, he took coaching positions in high school basketball teams. Early life Born in Nansemond County, Virginia, Strothers‚Äô parents Calvin and Brenda separated when he was three years old. His mother was later remarried to a supportive military man when he was five. His brother, Calvin Jr., played football and basketball at New Hampshire. Later he joined the military where he was selected to play on their elite basketball team as a power forward. Lamont also has a younger sister, Janell Joyner, whom he trained and she played basketball from Pee-Wee league thru high school as a point guard. Amateur career Strothers was a shooter for the Forest Glen high school varsity in Suffolk, Virginia. As a senior in 1986, his vision was impaired after being struck in the left eye by brass knuckles in a fistfight. After a year, Strothers was barred from signing up for the military because of his impaired vision. He then worked at a meatpacking plant and played in recreational leagues. Strothers turned down a partial scholarship offer from Georgia because of difficulty paying half the tuition.

For leading his team to a 21‚Äì4 record ten route to the Dixie Conference championship, he was named first-team All-American and Division III Player of the Year by Basketball Times in 1991. Strothers finished his collegiate career as the third all-time leading scorer in Division III history. Professional career In the 1991 NBA Draft, the Golden State Warriors drafted him in the 2nd round ‚Äî 43rd overall ‚Äî making him the highest-ever draft pick for an NCAA Division III player. He was subsequently traded to the Portland Trail Blazers. He spent parts of two seasons with Portland and the Dallas Mavericks, amassing an NBA career average of 4.6 points per game in a total of 13 games. Strothers played most of his career overseas and enjoyed success in the Philippines as an import for the San Miguel Beermen from 1996‚Äì2002. He was voted Best Import in the 1999 PBA Governors Cup. For his second title with the franchise, he led his sixth-seeded team to the 2000 Governor's Cup title. Strothers finished his PBA career with over 3,900 points.http://www.newsflash.org/2002/05/sp/sp001944.htm Coaching career Strothers, in 2006‚Äì07, was the head coach of a 15‚Äì8 team at Bethel.

A short tandem repeat is a microsatellite with repeat units that are 2 to 7 base pairs in length, with the number of repeats varying among individuals, making STRs effective for human identification purposes. This method differs from restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) since STR analysis does not cut the DNA with restriction enzymes. Instead, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is employed to discover the lengths of the short tandem repeats based on the length of the PCR product. Forensic uses STR analysis is a tool in forensic analysis that evaluates specific STR regions found on nuclear DNA. The variable (polymorphic) nature of the STR regions that are analyzed for forensic testing intensifies the discrimination between one DNA profile and another. Scientific tools such as FBI approved STRmix incorporate this research technique.https://dfs.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dfs/page_content/attachments/STRmix%20Validation.pdf Forensic science takes advantage of the population's variability in STR lengths, enabling scientists to distinguish one DNA sample from another. The system of DNA profiling used today is based on PCR and uses simple sequences or short tandem repeats (STR). This method uses highly polymorphic regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA (the most common is 4 bases repeated, but there are other lengths in use, including 3 and 5 bases). Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of repeat units, STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals. These STR loci (locations on a chromosome) are targeted with sequence-specific primers and amplified using PCR. The DNA fragments that result are then separated and detected using electrophoresis. There are two common methods of separation and detection, capillary electrophoresis (CE) and gel electrophoresis. Each STR is polymorphic, but the number of alleles is very small. Typically each STR allele will be shared by around 5 - 20% of individuals. The power of STR analysis comes from looking at multiple STR loci simultaneously. The pattern of alleles can identify an individual quite accurately. Thus STR analysis provides an excellent identification tool. The more STR regions that are tested in an individual the more discriminating the test becomes. From country to country, different STR-based DNA-profiling systems are in use. In North America, systems that amplify the CODIS 13 core loci are almost universal, whereas in the United Kingdom the DNA-17 17 loci system (which is compatible with The National DNA Database) is in use. Whichever system is used, many of the STR regions used are the same. These DNA-profiling systems are based on multiplex reactions, whereby many STR regions will be tested at the same time. The true power of STR analysis is in its statistical power of discrimination. Because the 13 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are independently assorted (having a certain number of repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the product rule for probabilities can be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, we can say that the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x1018) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches. Moreover, since there are about 12 million monozygotic twins on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate. In practice, the risk of contaminated-matching is much greater than matching a distant relative, such as contamination of a sample from nearby objects, or from left-over cells transferred from a prior test. The risk is greater for matching the most common person in the samples: Everything collected from, or in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are typically tested in order to ensure that they stayed clean, when prepared during the same period as the actual test samples. Unexpected matches (or variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of contamination for the actual test samples. In a relationship test, the full DNA profiles should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person was not matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.

Early life Yamao was born in Aio-Futajima, a village in Ch≈çsh≈´ domain (present day Yamaguchi prefecture), and received a traditional training as a Samurai. He was eager to learn science, and entered the Egawa School in Edo, then continued studying under Takeda Hishisaburo, a samurai engineer at Hakodate. In the end of 1862, he joined extremist group of Ch≈çsh≈´ domain, and set fire to newly completed British Legation building on Gotenyama. Five of the young Choshu samurais, so called Ch≈çsh≈´ Five soon left Japan for London from Nagasaki to study western knowledge in 1863 with help of Thomas Blake Glover. Study in the Britain Before being able to study at the University College London, the members of the Choshu Five studied English for a year. Two of his colleagues It≈ç Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru returned to Japan to try and stop Ch≈çsh≈´ domain going to war with the Western powers, but Yamao and two other remained and studied science and industry at University College London. After two years, Yamao moved to Glasgow to receive technical training at Napier's shipyard on the Clyde. He lived in the home of Colin Brown, a friend of Hugh Matheson, and attended evening classes at Anderson's College (now the University of Strathclyde). Henry Dyer also attended at the college and said he has seen Yamao, although they did not become personally acquainted at that time. Brown remembered that Yamao worked hard everyday from early in the morning for future of Japan at Glasgow, and could not help calling Yamao \\"Real Hero\\" when he was informed that Yamao took a position of responsibility in the Meiji government by C.A. McVeanBrown's Letter to Rev. Donald McVean, November 15, 1870, McVean Archives.. Return to Japan Soon after the Meiji Restoration took place, Yamao returned to Japan and joined the new Meiji government. He first took charge of the Yokosuka Shipyard (former Yokosuka Arsenal) and Yokohama Iron- works. Meanwhile Edmund Morel, a chief engineer for railway construction, proposed the new government to found the Ministry of Public Works, and Ito Hirobumi and Yamao endeavoured to create the new ministry. As Morel emphasised importance of engineers education and Colin Alexander McVean advised Yamao to set up survey department, Yamao successfully added these two departments into the new ministry in September 1871. After Morel passed away in October 1871, Yamao had to find new advisor for establishment of the engineering college, and eventually contacted Hugh Matheson again through good offices of McVeanHideo Izumida: Reconsideration of Foundation of the Imperial College of Engineering, Transaction of Architectural Institute of Japan, 2017.. Matheson kindly arranged appointment of teaching staff for the college lead by Henry Dyer through his connection with Lewis Gordon - William Rankine - William Thomson. Before arriving to Japan in June 1873, Dyer arranged calendar and syllabus for the engineering college on the board, which was accepted by Yamao without any revision. Yamao successfully established the college, which was officially renamed the Imperial College of Engineering in 1877. He also set up a school for the blind and deaf and is said to have introduced the idea of sign language to Japan. Yamao was elevated to the rank of shishaku (viscount) in the kazoku peerage system. Auld Lang Syne Colin Brown was Euing Lecturer of Music in the Andersonian College, and compiled \\"Songs of Scotland: New Symphonies and Accompaniments (1873)\\" together with J. Pittman, \\"Auld Langsyne\\" on page 21. Yamao has surely used to listen to this song at Colin Brown's home and it is possible that Yamao introduced Auld Lang Syne to Japan where it is called Hotaru no Hikari (The Light of the Fireflies) and is sung at high school graduation ceremonies.

Biography The eldest son of Mayes Wigg, a bank manager, and Agnes Wigg (formerly Sudbury), he grew up at Watton and Cromer in Norfolk and was educated at Gresham's School. In 1911, he arrived at the Norwich School of Art and later studied with Frank Spenlove-Spenlove at his Yellow Door School of Art in Beckenham, Kent. During the First World War, Wigg served with the British Army and saw active service at Gaza. In 1916, he was invalided out of the army with severe leg injuries, and was left with a disability for the rest of his life. Returning to his career as an artist and illustrator, he subsequently found life afloat easier than life on land and for many years lived and painted in a house- boat on the Norfolk Broads. He also had studios at The Thatched House, Brundall, his parents' home, and at Rose Cottage, Barton Turf. In 1952, Wigg married his mother's nurse, but this was disastrous for his artistic career. His new wife prevented him from painting, breaking his brushes and burning his paintings. Later, he tried to take up his work again but failed to achieve what he wanted. He died at St Mary's Hospital, Eastbourne, on 2 March 1969, leaving an estate of ¬£47,510. At the time of his death, he was living at East Hoathly, Sussex.Wigg Wills - C at ancestry.com, accessed 18 November 2008 Works Wigg was a landscape artist working mostly in watercolours and as an etcher, with only occasional paintings in oils. The Norfolk coast and scenery of the Broads gave him the subjects for his work, and his etchings were mostly of boats. He exhibited regularly at the Norwich Art Circle between 1909 and 1936, at the Royal Academy in 1915 and also with the British Water-colour Society.

He also served briefly as the Director-General of the Department of Transport and Main Roads in the state government of Queensland, Australia until he was sacked by Premier Campbell Newman. Caltabiano was referred to the parliamentarian ethics committee in October 2012, after comments he made two year ago's estimates committee hearing about the employment of Ben Gommers, the son of then arts minister Ros Bates. Early life Caltabiano studied engineering at James Cook University and a Master of Philosophy at Nottingham University (UK) and completed a Graduate Diploma of Business at Queensland University of Technology. He worked as a civil engineer and company director. Political career He was appointed as a replacement Liberal Party Councillor for Chandler Ward of the Brisbane City Council in 1996. Caltabiano replaced Liberal Graeme McDougall, who was elected to the Commonwealth seat of Griffith and had to resign his Council seat. Caltabiano subsequently won the 1997, 2000 and 2004 elections. Caltabiano served as Leader of the Opposition in Brisbane City Council from 2000 until 2002, when he was ousted during a factional deal involving a dispute over representation on the State Liberal Council. He was replaced by Margaret De Wit in 2002, who was in turn replaced by Graham Quirk in 2003. He was responsible for writing many of the policies for Lord Mayoral candidate Campbell Newman and was directly responsible for writing the 2004-05 Budget as presented to Council (normally this is the Lord Mayor's duty; however Newman preferred to leave this responsibility to other Liberal councillors.). He was also actively involved in party politics, serving as Queensland state president of the Liberal Party from 2003 to 2006. In mid-2005, Labor Deputy Premier Terry Mackenroth resigned from politics, sparking a by-election in the seat of Chatsworth, which included Caltabiano's council ward. Caltabiano was preselected as the Liberal candidate, and faced Labor candidate Chris Forrester, who he had defeated in the previous council election. The Labor government was struggling in the polls at the time, and Caltabiano won the seat with 52.35% of the vote. Caltabiano was appointed to the shadow ministry upon his election, taking on the role of Shadow Minister for Transport. He was widely viewed as a rising star in the party, and had been tipped as a future Liberal leader. In August 2006, following the accession of Bruce Flegg to the Liberal leadership, Caltabiano was promoted to Shadow Treasurer. Premier Peter Beattie called an election for 9 September 2006 and Labor preselected Chris Bombolas, a high-profile sports presenter, as its candidate. The Liberals struggled with a series of early gaffes. After a close race, Bombolas succeeded in taking the seat by several hundred votes. His wife Andrea was defeated as the Liberal National Party candidate in Chatsworth for the 2009 state election. Following the landslide Liberal National Party win in the 2012 state election, newly elected Premier Campbell Newman announced that Caltabiano would be appointed as Director-General of the Department of Transport and Main Roads. Investigation On 25 October 2012, Caltabiano was stood down as Director-General of the Department of Transport and Main Roads pending the result of an investigation into allegations of lying to parliament in budget estimate hearings Industrial career Caltabiano was involved with a political consultancy firm, Entree Vous. From June 2008 until he took over as Director-General of the Department of Transport and Main Roads, he was managing director of Infrastructure Delivery Pty Ltd. Following his being stood down (see 'Investigation' above) he became CEO of the Australian Asphalt Pavement Association in January 2014. In October 2016, the ARRB Group (formerly the Australian Road Research Board) announced that Caltabiano would be its next CEO, even though he had only been a board member since June of that year. He replaced retiring managing director, Gerald Waldron, in November 2016.

History Jet Set Satellite was founded in 1998 by singer/guitarist Trevor Tuminski and multi-instrumentalist/producer Dave Swiecicki. The pair released their debut album \\"Blueprint\\" in March, 2000, via Nettwerk Records. Touring with three hired musicians, the duo celebrated two Top 20 Canadian hit singles, \\"Best Way to Die\\" and \\"Baby, Cool Your Jets\\", at rock radio, and tie- in videos that received regular rotation on MuchMusic and MTV Europe that year.\\"Winnipeg‚Äôs one-hit wonders. They were supposed to be the next big thing. Where did they go?\\". The Uniter, Catherine van Reenen, March 31, 2011 Guitarist Mike Keller would soon become a member and, in 2001, bass player Tery Kazakoff and drummer Rich Reid were added to the group's lineup. In 2003, Tuminski and Swiecicki exercised an escape clause in their contract with Nettwerk so that the five band members could work on a second album with more creative freedom. During this time, Jet Set Satellite's music appeared in various media, including feature films \\"American Outlaws\\" and \\"Soul Survivors,\\" and video game EA Sports' NHL 2002. By mid-2004, the band would also part ways with Kazakoff, before releasing an independent follow-up to \\"Blueprint\\", entitled \\"Vegas,\\" on October 25, 2005, and distributed by Fusion 3. The title track (for which there is also a music video), \\"Together,\\" \\"Remover\\" and \\"Please Capture Me\\" were released as radio singles.

Distortion is most commonly used with the electric guitar, but may also be used with other electric instruments such as bass guitar, electric piano, and Hammond organ. Guitarists playing electric blues originally obtained an overdriven sound by turning up their vacuum tube-powered guitar amplifiers to high volumes, which caused the signal to distort. While overdriven tube amps are still used to obtain overdrive, especially in genres like blues and rockabilly, a number of other ways to produce distortion have been developed since the 1960s, such as distortion effect pedals. The growling tone of a distorted electric guitar is a key part of many genres, including blues and many rock music genres, notably hard rock, punk rock, hardcore punk, acid rock, and heavy metal music, while the use of distorted bass has been essential in a genre of hip hop music and alternative hip hop known as \\"SoundCloud rap\\".https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/look-at-me- the-noisy-blown-out-soundcloud-revolution-redefining-rap-123887/ The effects alter the instrument sound by clipping the signal (pushing it past its maximum, which shears off the peaks and troughs of the signal waves), adding sustain and harmonic and inharmonic overtones and leading to a compressed sound that is often described as \\"warm\\" and \\"dirty\\", depending on the type and intensity of distortion used. The terms distortion and overdrive are often used interchangeably; where a distinction is made, distortion is a more extreme version of the effect than overdrive. Fuzz is a particular form of extreme distortion originally created by guitarists using faulty equipment (such as a misaligned valve tube, see below), which has been emulated since the 1960s by a number of \\"fuzzbox\\" effects pedals. Distortion, overdrive, and fuzz can be produced by effects pedals, rackmounts, pre-amplifiers, power amplifiers (a potentially speaker-blowing approach), speakers and (since the 2000s) by digital amplifier modeling devices and audio software.Aikin, Jim (2004). Power Tools for Synthesizer Programming, Hal Leonard. p. 171. These effects are used with electric guitars, electric basses (fuzz bass), electronic keyboards, and more rarely as a special effect with vocals. While distortion is often created intentionally as a musical effect, musicians and sound engineers sometimes take steps to avoid distortion, particularly when using PA systems to amplify vocals or when playing back prerecorded music. History The guitar solo on Chuck Berry's 1955 single \\"Maybellene\\" features \\"warm\\" overtone distortion produced by an inexpensive valve (tube) amplifier. Early uses of amplified distortion The first guitar amplifiers were relatively low-fidelity, and would often produce distortion when their volume (gain) was increased beyond their design limit or if they sustained minor damage. Around 1945, Western-swing guitarist Junior Barnard began experimenting with a rudimentary humbucker pick-up and a small amplifier to obtain his signature \\"low-down and dirty\\" bluesy sound. Many electric blues guitarists, including Chicago bluesmen such as Elmore James and Buddy Guy, experimented in order to get a guitar sound that paralleled the rawness of blues singers such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf,Michael Campbell & James Brody, Rock and Roll: An Introduction, pages 80-81 replacing often their originals with the powerful Valco \\"Chicagoan\\" pick-ups, originally created for lap-steel, to obtain a louder and fatter tone. In early rock music, Goree Carter's \\"Rock Awhile\\" (1949) featured an over-driven electric guitar style similar to that of Chuck Berry several years later,Robert Palmer, \\"Church of the Sonic Guitar\\", pp. 13-38 in Anthony DeCurtis, Present Tense, Duke University Press, 1992, p. 19. . as well as Joe Hill Louis' \\"Boogie in the Park\\" (1950). In the early 1950s, pioneering rock guitarist Willie Johnson of Howlin' Wolf‚Ä≤s band began deliberately increasing gain beyond its intended levels to produce \\"warm\\" distorted sounds. Guitar Slim also experimented with distorted overtones, which can be heard in his hit electric blues song \\"The Things That I Used to Do\\" (1953). Chuck Berry's 1955 classic \\"Maybellene\\" features a guitar solo with warm overtones created by his small valve amplifier. Pat Hare produced heavily distorted power chords on his electric guitar for records such as James Cotton's \\"Cotton Crop Blues\\" (1954) as well as his own \\"I'm Gonna Murder My Baby\\" (1954), creating \\"a grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound,\\"Robert Palmer, \\"Church of the Sonic Guitar\\", pp. 13-38 in Anthony DeCurtis, Present Tense, Duke University Press, 1992, pp. 24-27. . accomplished by turning the volume knob on his amplifier \\"all the way to the right until the speaker was screaming.\\" In the mid-1950s, guitar distortion sounds started to evolve based on sounds created earlier in the decade by accidental damage to amps, such as in the popular early recording of the 1951 Ike Turner and the Kings of Rhythm song \\"Rocket 88\\", where guitarist Willie Kizart used a vacuum tube amplifier that had a speaker cone slightly damaged in transport. Rock guitarists began intentionally \\"doctoring\\" amplifiers and speakers in order to emulate this form of distortion. In 1956, guitarist Paul Burlison of the Johnny Burnette Trio deliberately dislodged a vacuum tube in his amplifier to record \\"The Train Kept A-Rollin\\" after a reviewer raved about the sound Burlison's damaged amplifier produced during a live performance. According to other sources Burlison's amp had a partially broken loudspeaker cone. Pop-oriented producers were horrified by that eerie \\"two-tone\\" sound, quite clean on trebles but strongly distorted on basses, but Burnette insisted to publish the sessions, arguing that \\"that guitar sounds like a nice horn section\\". In the late 1950s, Guitarist Link Wray began intentionally manipulating his amplifiers' vacuum tubes to create a \\"noisy\\" and \\"dirty\\" sound for his solos after a similarly accidental discovery. Wray also poked holes in his speaker cones with pencils to further distort his tone, used electronic echo chambers (then usually employed by singers), the recent powerful and \\"fat\\" Gibson humbucker pickups, and controlled \\"feedback\\" (Larsen effect). The resultant sound can be heard on his highly influential 1958 instrumental, \\"Rumble\\" and Rawhide. 1960s: fuzz, distortion, and introduction of commercial devices In 1961, Grady Martin scored a hit with a fuzzy tone caused by a faulty preamplifier that distorted his guitar playing on the Marty Robbins song \\"Don't Worry\\". Later that year Martin recorded an instrumental tune under his own name, using the same faulty preamp. The song, on the Decca label, was called \\"The Fuzz.\\" Martin is generally credited as the discoverer of the \\"fuzz effect.\\" Big Muff fuzzboxes: a NYC re-issue (L) and a Russian Sovtek version (R) Shortly thereafter, the American instrumental rock band The Ventures asked their friend, session musician and electronics enthusiast Orville \\"Red\\" Rhodes for help recreating the Grady Martin \\"fuzz\\" sound. Rhodes offered The Ventures a fuzzbox he had made, which they used to record \\"2000 Pound Bee\\" in 1962. The best-known early commercial distortion circuit was the Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone, manufactured by Gibson, released in 1962. Also in the early 1960s, surf rock guitarist Dick Dale, who produced hits such as \\"Let's Go Trippin'\\" (1961) and \\"Misirlou\\" (1962), worked closely with Fender to push the limits of electric amplification technology, producing the first 100-watt guitar amplifier.History, Dick Dale official website In 1964, a fuzzy and somewhat distorted sound gained widespread popularity after guitarist Dave Davies of The Kinks used a razor blade to slash his speaker cones for the band's single \\"You Really Got Me\\".Walser 1993, p. 9 In May 1965 Keith Richards used a Gibson Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone to record \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\". The song's success greatly boosted sales of the device, and all available stock sold out by the end of 1965. Other early fuzzboxes include the Mosrite FuzzRITE and Arbiter Group Fuzz Face used by Jimi Hendrix, the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi used by Hendrix and Carlos Santana, and the Vox Tone Bender used by Paul McCartney to play fuzz bass on \\"Think for Yourself\\" and other Beatles recordings. In 1966, Jim Marshall of the British company Marshall Amplification began modifying the electronic circuitry of his amplifiers so as to achieve a \\"brighter, louder\\" sound and fuller distortion capabilities. Also in 1966, Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd created the song Interstellar Overdrive, a song made entirely in electric distortion. It was released a year later in modified form on their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. In the late 1960s and early 1970s hard rock bands such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath forged what would eventually become the heavy metal sound through a combined use of high volumes and heavy distortion. Theory and circuits Waveform plot showing the different types of clipping. Valve overdrive is a form of soft limiting, while transistor clipping or extremely overdriven valves resemble hard clipping. The word distortion refers to any modification of wave form of a signal, but in music it is used to refer to nonlinear distortion (excluding filters) and particularly to the introduction of new frequencies by memoryless nonlinearities. In music the different forms of linear distortion have specific names describing them. The simplest of these is a distortion process known as \\"volume adjustment\\", which involves distorting the amplitude of a sound wave in a proportional (or ‚Äòlinear‚Äô) way in order to increase or decrease the volume of the sound without affecting the tone quality. In the context of music, the most common source of (nonlinear) distortion is clipping in amplifier circuits and is most commonly known as overdrive. Clipping is a non-linear process that produces frequencies not originally present in the audio signal. These frequencies can be harmonic overtones, meaning they are whole number multiples of one of the signal's original frequencies, or \\"inharmonic\\", resulting from general intermodulation distortion. The same nonlinear device will produce both types of distortion, depending on the input signal. Intermodulation occurs whenever the input frequencies are not already harmonically related. For instance, playing a power chord through distortion results in intermodulation that produces new subharmonics. \\"Soft clipping\\" gradually flattens the peaks of a signal which creates a number of higher harmonics which share a harmonic relationship with the original tone. \\"Hard clipping\\" flattens peaks abruptly, resulting in higher power in higher harmonics. As clipping increases, a tone input progressively begins to resemble a square wave which has odd number harmonics. This is generally described as sounding \\"harsh\\". Distortion and overdrive circuits each 'clip' the signal before it reaches the main amplifier (clean boost circuits do not necessarily create 'clipping') as well as boost signals to levels that cause distortion to occur at the main amplifier's front end stage (by exceeding the ordinary input signal amplitude, thus overdriving the amplifier) Note : product names may not accurately reflect type of circuit involved - see above. A fuzz box alters an audio signal until it is nearly a square wave and adds complex overtones by way of a frequency multiplier. Valve overdrive Triode valve Vacuum tube or \\"valve\\" distortion is achieved by \\"overdriving\\" the valves in an amplifier. In layman's terms, overdriving is pushing the tubes beyond their normal rated maximum. Valve amplifiers‚Äîparticularly those using class-A triodes‚Äîtend to produce asymmetric soft clipping that creates both even and odd harmonics. The increase in even harmonics is considered to create \\"warm\\"-sounding overdrive effects. A basic triode valve (tube) contains a cathode, a plate and a grid. When a positive voltage is applied to the plate, a current of negatively charged electrons flows to it from the heated cathode through the grid. This increases the voltage of the audio signal, amplifying its volume. The grid regulates the extent to which plate voltage is increased. A small negative voltage applied to the grid causes a large decrease in plate voltage. Valve amplification is more or less linear‚Äîmeaning the parameters (amplitude, frequency, phase) of the amplified signal are proportional to the input signal‚Äîso long as the voltage of the input signal does not exceed the valve's \\"linear region of operation\\". The linear region falls between 1. the saturation region: the voltages at which plate current stops responding to positive increases in grid voltage and 2. the cutoff region: the voltages at which the charge of the grid is too negative for electrons to flow to the plate. If a valve is biased within the linear region and the input signal's voltage exceeds this region, overdrive and non-linear clipping will occur. Multiple stages of valve gain/clipping can be \\"cascaded\\" to produce a thicker and more complex distortion sound. In layperson's terms, a musician will plug a fuzz pedal into a tube amp that is being \\"cranked\\" to a clipping \\"overdriven\\" condition; as such, the musician will get the distortion from the fuzz which is then distorted further by the amp. During the 1990s, some Seattle grunge guitarists chained together as many as four fuzz pedals to create a thick \\"wall of sound\\" of distortion. In some modern valve effects, the \\"dirty\\" or \\"gritty\\" tone is actually achieved not by high voltage, but by running the circuit at voltages that are too low for the circuit components, resulting in greater non- linearity and distortion. These designs are referred to as \\"starved plate\\" configurations, and result in an \\"amp death\\" sound. Solid-state distortion Solid-state amplifiers incorporating transistors and/or op amps can be made to produce hard clipping. When symmetrical, this adds additional high-amplitude odd harmonics, creating a \\"dirty\\" or \\"gritty\\" tone. When asymmetrical, it produces both even and odd harmonics. Electronically, this is usually achieved by either amplifying the signal to a point where it is clipped by the DC voltage limitation of the power supply rail, or by clipping the signal with diodes. Many solid-state distortion devices attempt to emulate the sound of overdriven vacuum valves using additional solid-state circuitry. Some amplifiers (notably the Marshall JCM 900) utilize hybrid designs that employ both valve and solid-state components. Approaches Guitar distortion can be produced by many components of the guitar's signal path, including effects pedals, the pre-amplifier, power amplifier, and speakers. Many players use a combination of these to obtain their \\"signature\\" tone. Pre-amplifier distortion The pre-amplifier section of a guitar amplifier serves to amplify a weak instrument signal to a level that can drive the power amplifier. It often also contains circuitry to shape the tone of the instrument, including equalization and gain controls. Often multiple cascading gain/clipping stages are employed to generate distortion. Because the first component in a valve amplifier is a valve gain stage, the output level of the preceding elements of the signal chain has a strong influence on the distortion created by that stage. The output level of the guitar's pickups, the setting of the guitar's volume knob, how hard the strings are plucked, and the use of volume-boosting effects pedals can drive this stage harder and create more distortion. During the 1980s and 1990s, most valve amps featured a \\"master volume\\" control, an adjustable attenuator between the preamp section and the power amp. When the preamp volume is set high to generate high distortion levels, the master volume lowered, keeping the output volume at manageable levels. Overdrive/distortion pedals The Ibanez TS9 Tube Screamer is a popular overdrive pedal Analog overdrive/distortion pedals work on similar principles to preamplifier distortion. Because most effects pedals are designed to operate from battery voltages, using vacuum tubes to generate distortion and overdrive is impractical; instead, most pedals use solid-state transistors, op-amps and diodes. Classic examples of overdrive/distortion pedals include the Boss OD series (overdrives), the Ibanez Tube Screamer (an overdrive), the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi (a fuzz box) and the Pro Co RAT (a distortion). Typically, \\"overdrive\\" pedals are designed to produce sounds associated with classic rock or blues, with \\"distortion\\" pedals producing the \\"high gain, scooped mids\\" sounds associated with heavy metal; fuzz boxes are designed to emulate the distinctive sound of the earliest overdrive pedals such as the Big Muff and the Fuzz Face. Most overdrive/distortion pedals can be used in two ways: a pedal can be used as a \\"boost\\" with an already overdriven amplifier to drive it further into saturation and \\"color\\" the tone, or it can be used with a completely clean amplifier to generate the whole overdrive/distortion effect. With care‚Äîand with appropriately chosen pedals‚Äîit is possible to \\"stack\\" multiple overdrive/distortion pedals together, allowing one pedal to act as a 'boost' for another. Fuzz boxes and other heavy distortions can produce unwanted dissonances when playing chords. To get around this, guitar players (and keyboard players) using these effects may restrict their playing to single notes and simple \\"power chords\\" (root, fifth, and octave). Indeed, with the most extreme fuzz pedals, players may choose to play mostly single notes, because the fuzz can make even single notes sound very thick and heavy. Heavy distortion also tends to limit the player's control of dynamics (loudness and softness)‚Äîsimilar to the limitations imposed on a Hammond organ player (Hammond organ does not produce louder or softer sounds depending on how hard or soft the performer plays the keys; however, the performer can still control the volume with drawbars and the expression pedal). Heavy metal music has evolved around these restrictions, using complex rhythms and timing for expression and excitement. Lighter distortions and overdrives can be used with triadic chords and seventh chords; as well, lighter overdrive allows more control of dynamics. Power amplifier distortion A pair of 6L6GC power valves, often used in American-made amplifiers Power valves (tubes) can be overdriven in the same way that pre- amplifier valves can, but because these valves are designed to output more power, the distortion and character they add to the guitar's tone is unique. During the 1960s to early 1970s, distortion was primarily created by overdriving the power valves. Because they have become accustomed to this sound , many guitar players favour this type of distortion, and thus set their amps to maximum levels in order to drive the power section hard. Many valve- based amplifiers in common use have a push-pull output configuration in their power section, with matched pairs of tubes driving the output transformer. Power amplifier distortion is normally entirely symmetric, generating predominantly odd-order harmonics. Because driving the power valves this hard also means maximum volume, which can be difficult to manage in a small recording or rehearsal space, many solutions have emerged that in some way divert some of this power valve output from the speakers, and allow the player to generate power valve distortion without excessive volume. These include built-in or separate power attenuators and power-supply-based power attenuation, such as a VVR, or Variable Voltage Regulator to drop the voltage on the valves' plates, to increase distortion whilst lowering volume. Guitarists such as Eddie Van Halen have been known to use variacs before VVR technology was invented. Lower-power valve amps (such as a quarter-watt or less), speaker isolation cabinets, and low-efficiency guitar speakers are also used to tame the volume. Power-valve distortion can also be produced in a dedicated rackmount valve power amp. A modular rackmount setup often involves a rackmount preamp, a rackmount valve power amp, and a rackmount dummy load to attenuate the output to desired volume levels. Some effects pedals internally produce power-valve distortion, including an optional dummy load for use as a power-valve distortion pedal. Such effects units can use a preamp valve such as the 12AX7 in a power-valve circuit configuration (as in the Stephenson's Stage Hog), or use a conventional power valve, such as the EL84 (as in the H&K; Crunch Master compact tabletop unit). However, because these are usually placed before the pre-amplifier in the signal chain, they contribute to the overall tone in a different way. Power amplifier distortion may damage speakers. A Direct Inject signal can capture the power-tube distortion sound without the direct coloration of a guitar speaker and microphone. This DI signal can be blended with a miked guitar speaker, with the DI providing a more present, immediate, bright sound, and the miked guitar speaker providing a colored, remote, darker sound. The DI signal can be obtained from a DI jack on the guitar amp, or from the Line Out jack of a power attenuator. Output transformer distortion The output transformer sits between the power valves and the speaker, serving to match impedance. When a transformer's ferromagnetic core becomes electromagnetically saturated a loss of inductance takes place, since the back E.M.F. is reliant on a change in flux in the core. As the core reaches saturation, the flux levels off and cannot increase any further. With no change in flux there is no back E.M.F. and hence no reflected impedance. The transformer and valve combination then generate large 3rd order harmonics. So long as the core does not go into saturation, the valves will clip naturally as they drop the available voltage across them. In single ended systems the output harmonics will be largely even ordered due to the valve's relatively non linear characteristics at large signal swings. This is only true however if the magnetic core does NOT saturate.transformer design Power supply \\"sag\\" Early valve amplifiers used unregulated power supplies. This was due to the high cost associated with high-quality high- voltage power supplies. The typical anode (plate) supply was simply a rectifier, an inductor and a capacitor. When the valve amplifier was operated at high volume, the power supply voltage would dip, reducing power output and causing signal attenuation and compression. This dipping effect is known as \\"sag\\", and is sought-after by some electric guitarists. Sag only occurs in class-AB amplifiers. This is because, technically, sag results from more current being drawn from the power supply, causing a greater voltage drop over the rectifier valve. , so sag does not occur. As this effect is more pronounced with higher input signals, the harder \\"attack\\" of a note will be compressed more heavily than the lower-voltage \\"decay\\", making the latter seem louder and thereby improving sustain. Additionally, because the level of compression is affected by input volume, the player can control it via their playing intensity: playing harder results in more compression or \\"sag\\". In contrast, modern amplifiers often use high-quality, well-regulated power supplies. Speaker distortion Guitar loudspeakers are designed differently from high fidelity stereo speakers or public address system speakers. While hi-fi and public address speakers are designed to reproduce the sound with as little distortion as possible, guitar speakers are usually designed so that they will shape or color the tone of the guitar, either by enhancing some frequencies or attenuating unwanted frequencies. When the power delivered to a guitar speaker approaches its maximum rated power, the speaker's performance degrades, causing the speaker to \\"break up\\", adding further distortion and colouration to the signal. Some speakers are designed to have much clean headroom, while others are designed to break up early to deliver grit and growl. Amp modeling for distortion emulation A Line 6 modeling amplifier shown from above. Note the various amplifier and speaker emulations selectable via the rotary knob on the left. Guitar amp modeling devices and software can reproduce various guitar-specific distortion qualities that are associated with a range of popular \\"stomp box\\" pedals and amplifiers. Amp modeling devices typically use digital signal processing to recreate the sound of plugging into analogue pedals and overdriven valve amplifiers. The most sophisticated devices allow the user to customize the simulated results of using different preamp, power-tube, speaker distortion, speaker cabinet, and microphone placement combinations. For example, a guitarist using a small amp modeling pedal could simulate the sound of plugging their electric guitar into a heavy vintage valve amplifier and a stack of 8 X 10\\" speaker cabinets. Voicing with equalization Guitar distortion is obtained and shaped at various points in the signal processing chain, including multiple stages of preamp distortion, power valve distortion, output and power transformer distortion, and guitar speaker distortion. Much of the distortion character or voicing is controlled by the frequency response before and after each distortion stage. This dependency of distortion voicing on frequency response can be heard in the effect that a wah pedal has on the subsequent distortion stage, or by using tone controls built into the guitar, the preamp or an EQ pedal to favor the bass or treble components of the guitar pickup signal prior to the first distortion stage. Some guitarists place an equalizer pedal after the distortion effect, to emphasize or de-emphasize different frequencies in the distorted signal. Increasing the bass and treble while reducing or eliminating the centre midrange (750 Hz) results in what is popularly known as a \\"scooped\\" sound (since the midrange frequencies are \\"scooped\\" out). Conversely, decreasing the bass while increasing the midrange and treble creates a punchy, harsher sound. Rolling off all of the treble produces a dark, heavy sound. Avoiding distortion audio compression devices, such as this DBX 566, are used by audio engineers to prevent signal peaks from causing unwanted distortion. While musicians intentionally create or add distortion to electric instrument signals or vocals to create a musical effect, there are some musical styles and musical applications where as little distortion as possible is sought. When DJs are playing recorded music in a nightclub, they typically seek to reproduce the recordings with little or no distortion. In many musical styles, including pop music, country music and even genres where the electric guitars are almost always distorted, such as metal and hard rock, sound engineers usually take a number of steps to ensure that the vocals sounding through the sound reinforcement system are undistorted (the exception is the rare cases where distortion is purposely added to vocals in a song as a special effect). Sound engineers prevent unwanted, unintended distortion and clipping using a number of methods. They may reduce the gain on microphone preamplifiers on the audio console; use attenuation \\"pads\\" (a button on audio console channel strips, DI unit and some bass amplifiers); and use electronic audio compressor effects and limiters to prevent sudden volume peaks from vocal mics from causing unwanted distortion. Though some bass guitar players in metal and punk bands intentionally use fuzz bass to distort their bass sound, in other genres of music, such as pop, big band jazz and traditional country music, bass players typically seek an undistorted bass sound. To obtain a clear, undistorted bass sound, professional bass players in these genres use high-powered amplifiers with a lot of \\"headroom\\" and they may also use audio compressors to prevent sudden volume peaks from causing distortion. In many cases, musicians playing stage pianos or synthesizers use keyboard amplifiers that are designed to reproduce the audio signal with as little distortion as possible. The exceptions with keyboards are the Hammond organ as used in blues and the Fender Rhodes as used in rock music; with these instruments and genres, keyboardists often purposely overdrive a tube amplifier to get a natural overdrive sound. Another example of instrument amplification where as little distortion as possible is sought is with acoustic instrument amplifiers, designed for musicians playing instruments such as the mandolin or fiddle in a folk or bluegrass style.

Explanation  Musicians playing through vacuum tube guitar amplifiers sometimes want to produce distortion by overdriving the amplifier's output stage. Under such a condition, the amplifier is close to or at its maximum output power. The resulting volume level is unsuitable for many playing conditions. By reducing the power to the speaker, a power attenuator reduces the volume without altering the overdriven quality of the tone. The most common approach to power attenuation is a power soaker, which absorbs a portion of the power and dissipates it as heat. This device connects between the amplifier output and the guitar speaker. A typical attenuator circuit is the L pad. A variable L pad is a power divider circuit that provides an adjustable power level to a speaker while maintaining a constant load impedance on the amplifier. Another approach uses a variac or power scaling circuit, which reduces the B+ supply voltage available to the power tubes thus producing power tube distortion at a reduced level, while all available output power still goes to the guitar speaker. The Variac method bears the risk that voltage to the tubes can damage the filament or cathode if operated beyond manufacturer specifications. In a power scaling circuit, by decreasing just the B+ plate voltage, the cathode bias and screen grid voltage decrease proportionately, while the filament voltage stays constant. However the term power attenuator may be a misnomer for this type of power control, because lowering B+ voltage tends to increase distortion, where by convention, an attenuator should not introduce distortion. Power damping is an output level control method that involves the phase inverter and a potentiometer. The potentiometer lets the musician overdrive that at reduced output, similar to a post phase inverter master volume (PPIMV) control.  Description  A power attenuator can be either purely resistive, or mostly resistive and partly reactive. The original guitar amp power attenuator, the Altair Attenuator, was primarily resistive, used a rotary switch to select taps on a toaster coil with low inductance windings. Another early model, simply called 'Power Attenuator' by Active Guitar Electronics, used continuously variable power rheostats. Other models, such as the Marshall Power Brake, add some electrical inductance or capacitance to the electrical load (including fans, light bulbs and coils). There is debate about whether reactive attenuators do a better job of preserving a guitar amplifier's tone. A guitar amplifier power attenuator may also offer a line- level output jack for sending the distortion-processed signal through an effects chain, to a recording console, or for the purpose of re-amplifying signal through a larger or smaller amplifier. If the amplifier is designed to accommodate routine full power use, an attenuator neither increases nor reduces the potential for amplifier damage. An early guitar amplifier that included a power attenuator was the Jim Kelley amplifier, which came with its own L-pad type attenuator. Some production attenuators are the Scholz Power Soak, the Marshall Power Brake, THD Hot Plate, Weber MASS, Audiostorm HotBox and ARACOM.

When \\"striking\\" one isn't required to be a seaman, but must belong to one of three undesignated rates: Fireman (FN), Seaman (SN), or Airman (AN). (Striking is no longer authorized in the USCG) It is also possible cross rate to Gunner's Mate. Cross rating refers to the act of an enlisted sailor \\"crossing\\" from their current rating to another rating of their choice, provided their ASVAB scores are high enough and there are open slots for the rate. The Gunner's Mate \\"A\\" school is held at Naval Training Center Great Lakes, Illinois and Yorktown, VA for the USCG. In its early years, the school was very hands-on, but it is now primarily conducted through technical educational tools, such as self-study computer-based training (CBT). Training focuses on the operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of naval guns, missile launchers and torpedoes as well as a strong emphasis on basic explosives, guidance and tracking systems, small arms, Naval ammunition classification, and safety. Upon completion of this basic training, enlisted members often continue on to a specialized \\"C\\" school, where they learn a particular weapons system. A Gunner's Mate fires a shot line with an M14 rifle from the to . A GM will specialize in a multitude of weapons varieties; arms such as, shotguns, semiautomatic and automatic rifles, pistols, submachine guns, machine guns, explosives, both portable and large-scale, mounted weapons systems, and various rockets, torpedoes, and missiles. As well as this, GMs care for and assist in operating shooting ranges, armories, and the storage and maintenance of arms. On February 26, 2007 the Chief of Naval Operations approved the merger of the gunner‚Äôs mate (GM) and torpedoman‚Äôs mate (TM) ratings into the GM rating. The move was made to leverage the strengths, knowledge, skills and abilities found in the two ratings to meet current and future strategic mission needs. ‚ÄúThe training sailors receive after basic training for their ratings on an apprentice level has been the same for both gunner's and torpedomen's mates,‚Äù said Senior Chief Torpedoman's Mate, Sherry Secrease of the Navy Personnel Command. ‚ÄúThis makes the merger easier to accomplish.‚ÄùTorpedoman's Mate and Gunner's Mate Ratings Merge, at navy.mil. The Gunner's Mate rating is primarily surface warfare- based. Closely associated Naval occupational ratings are Fire Controlman (FC), Aviation Ordnanceman (AO), Missile Technician (MT), Mineman (MN). The Gunner's Mate rating is one of the original ratings created as a result of the Naval Armament Act of 1794. The others include Boatswain's Mate (BM), Quartermasters (QM), Master-at-Arms (MA), and Yeoman (YN). The rating is also among the top five source ratings for enlisted Naval Special Warfare candidates.

It was a byproduct of a land boom period and a victim of the land bust that occurred soon thereafter. It opened officially on January 31, 1888. Inception The service was originally organized as the Pasadena Railway Company in 1887 by investors John Woodbury, James Swartout, and the two prominent and wealthy Altadenans, Andrew McNally and Colonel George Gill Green, mutual friends of McNally from Chicago and Green from Woodbury, New Jersey. Swartout had a large estate between New York Dr. and Boston St. near Maiden Lane which lies in a lower section of Altadena near the Pasadena border. He already owned the horse drawn Highland Railroad Company which accessed his property. Brothers John and Frederick Woodbury were the developers of the Altadena community located north of Pasadena against the San Gabriel Mountains. Frederick had a Ranch house near the Piedmont (Altadena Drive) and John had proposed building a mansion near the homes of McNally and Green. Andrew McNally was the co-founder of the famed map making company Rand McNally in Chicago and had retired to Altadena in 1887. Green had made his fortunes in patent medicines and elixirs with his company based in Woodbury, New Jersey and was invited by McNally to move to Altadena in the same year. McNally and Green were heavily invested in the small railway, and each had a siding for his own private car to be pulled up alongside their properties which stood on either side of Santa Rosa Avenue from each other. Route description 100px Route in 1894 The railway originated at a terminus near the Raymond Station by the Raymond Hotel which was the premier Pasadena winter residence for many eastern magnates. The rails roughly paralleled Fair Oaks Avenue, then crossed Lincoln Avenue to the east then again to the west and headed toward the Arroyo Seco. It turned northward to an area called Las Casitas (the little houses) then swung wide to the east to an alignment with today's Harriet Street in Altadena and ran between Mendocino and Calaveras streets to a terminus on Lake Avenue which would align with the present-day Altadena Post Office building. This right-of-way agrees with the original plan of a railroad on Woodbury's 1887 plot map, and lends support to the idea that this railroad had greater purpose than that of appeasing a couple of millionaires, even though they were often the only riders. Depending on which end of the railway one might live, the line was called either the Pasadena Railroad or the Altadena Railroad. The Altadena terminus when adjoined by Professor Lowe's Mount Lowe Railway was then named \\"Mountain Junction.\\" Expansion of the line By 1890 the Pasadena/Altadena Railway was assumed by a couple of other failing rail lines that connected it to Los Angeles. It became an immediate success. In July 1891 it was joined again with a line that connected it to San Pedro. The line was renamed the Los Angeles Terminal Railway, and subsequently so was its San Pedro terminus at Rattlesnake Island, now Terminal Island. The original Woodbury plan to have a line run from an Altadena railroad yard to Salt Lake City, Utah, was still in the offing, but the railway's financial difficulties made such an expansion impossible. In 1891 the principals of the Los Angeles Terminal Railway, including Los Angeles mayor William Workman were again thinking of building a road to Salt Lake City. Up to this time there were many railroads that had gone so far as to plot their plans on paper. Union Pacific Railroad (UP) was alone in any effort at all to construct this line. However, only one titan was willing to put his money into action, William Andrews Clark, a wealthy Montana mining magnate and banker. In August, newspapers announced that the Los Angeles Terminal Railway had been purchased by Clark and that Henry Hawkgood had started surveys for Clark. Little known until this point was that Clark had also obtained all rights to the Utah and California Railroad (U&C;), a line planned to build from Salt Lake City to the Nevada state line. Although the U&C; was only a railroad on paper, it provided Clark with valuable information and location maps. Incorporated in Salt Lake City in 1901 as the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, the line offered state-of-art passenger amenities even though its main attraction for Clark was the potential in freight services. E. H. Harriman (then President of Union Pacific) took immediate notice. This new \\"Salt Lake Route\\" utilized trackage in Utah originally constructed for the UP, and the UP held an equity interest in the new line. Renamed the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad in 1916, the Salt Lake line was eventually absorbed into the UP system, and remains an integral part of that railroad today. Quarrying in the Arroyo Seco By 1901 a spur track had been laid into the Arroyo Seco near Devil's Gate for the purpose of quarrying rock for the construction of the Los Angeles Harbor breakwater. By 1903 the trans-Altadena service was abandoned and the rails were pulled up. It took decades for the bordering properties to assume the abandoned right-of-way, and to this day slight traces of where the rail line passed through can be sleuthed out. Abandonment By 1916 quarrying in the Arroyo had been abandoned since the rock material proved to be too unstable for its intended purposes, and by 1921 the Arroyo-Windsor lines were taken up. Shortly thereafter, there being found no viable use for the railway, the remainder of the original line was abandoned altogether. Today only a fenced right of way can be seen passing between the buildings and houses between Windsor and El Sol Avenues in Altadena. A fenced-in section can also be seen adjacent to the northbound Lincoln Avenue off ramp of Interstate 210, where the train used to head toward the Las Casitas flats.

They were sold as the Nissan Junior Microbus and Caball Microbus respectively. In June 1960, reflecting model changes for the Junior and Caball (now B140 and C140), the Caball and Junior Microbuses were also updated and the GC140 Caball Microbus became a regularly available model. In 1961 the GC140 was renamed Caball Echo; the Junior-based buses seem to have been discontinued around this time. In 1962 the engine was changed to the 1.9-liter H engine and the name shortened to just \\"Echo.\\" The chassis number was changed to GC141. In 1963 there was a light facelift, with higher mounted headlights and round rather than rectangular indicators. A long wheelbase model (GHC141) was also introduced. In January 1964 the SD22 diesel engine (GQC/GHQC141) joined the lineup. In November 1964 and October 1965 there were another two light facelifts; the second one also brought changes to the cooling system and the chassis code switched to 142.

Some visible parts were shared with the Caball, such as the headlight bezels. In October 1968 there were modifications inside and out, including a padded dashboard and large combination taillights. In April 1969 a twin rear- tire model was added, and a 1970 facelift brought headlights integrated with the grille and headrests for all seats. After a series of high publicity accidents involving failing propshafts, followed by a hearing in the Diet, Nissan developed a two-piece propshaft. Nonetheless, the \\"Echo\\" name had received bad connotations and in September 1971 the C240 Echo was renamed \\"Civilian.\\" Engines remained the 2-liter H20 petrol unit and the SD22 diesel.

Dillon (1819 - 27 June 1881) was an English actor-manager and tragedienne. In 1840, he appeared at the City Theatre, London, as Hamlet, giving a performance which attracted some critical attention. He toured extensively, to improve his reputation. Becoming actor-manager of the Theatre Royal, Wolverhampton in 1848, in partnership with comedian Henry Widdicombe. In 1856, at age 37, he returned to London, acting at Sadler's Wells, his success was decisive. From \\"the Wells\\" he went to the Lyceum, where he became manager on 29 September 1856, becoming manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1857. In 1860-61, he left England with his wife, Clara, for a tour around the world. They reached America and on 18 April 1861, he appeared at the Winter Garden, as Belph√©gor. The War of the Rebellion began at that time, affecting trade in the theatres. In 1863, Dillon was in California. He performed for 100 consecutive nights at the Metropolitan Theatre, San Francisco, and was the recipient of much public favour. He then spent two years touring Australia. In 1865, he returned to America and filled engagements throughout the country, reaching New York in the spring of 1866. On 16 May he appeared at Niblo's Garden, as Belph√©gor.

D. Eastman published by Random House Books for Young Readers on June 12, 1960, as part of its Beginner Books series. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\\" It was one of the \\"Top 100 Picture Books\\" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal. Plot summary Are You My Mother? is the story about a hatchling bird. His mother, thinking her egg will stay in her nest where she left it, leaves her egg alone and flies off to find food. The baby bird hatches. He does not understand where his mother is so he goes to look for her. As he lacks the ability to fly, he walks, and in his search, he asks a kitten (who says nothing), a hen, a dog, and a cow if they are his mother, but none of them are. Refusing to give up, he sees an old car, which he realizes certainly cannot be his mother. In desperation, the hatchling calls out to a boat and a plane (neither responds), and at last, he approaches and climbs onto the teeth of an enormous power shovel. It belches \\"SNORT\\" from its exhaust stack, prompting the bird to cry, \\"You are not my mother! You are a Snort!\\" As the machine shudders and grinds into motion, he cannot escape. \\"I want my mother!\\" he sobs. At that moment, the Snort drops the hatchling into his nest, and his mother returns. The two are reunited, much to their delight, and the baby bird recounts to his mother the adventures he had looking for her.

Normal fruitless function is required for proper development of several anatomical structures necessary for courtship, including motor neurons which innervate muscles needed for fly sexual behaviors. The gene does not have an obvious mammalian homolog, but appears to function in sex determination in species as distant as the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. fruitless serves as an example of how a gene or a group of genes may regulate the development and/or function of neurons involved in innate behavior. Research on fruitless has received attention in the popular press, since it provokes discussion on genetics of human sexual orientation, and behaviors such as gender-specific aggression.  Function  Male flies with mutations in the fruitless gene display altered sexual behavior. Fruitfly courtship, which involves a complex male-initiated ritual, may be disrupted in many ways by mutated fru alleles; fru is necessary for every step in the ritual. Some alleles prevent courting entirely, while others disrupt individual components. Notably, some loss-of-function alleles change or remove sexual preference. Although many genes are known to be involved in male courtship behavior, the fruitless gene has been considered noteworthy because it exhibits sex-specific alternative splicing. When females produce the male-spliced gene product, they behave as males. Males that do not produce the male-specific product do not court females and are infertile. In the brain, a subset (ca. 2,000) of neurons express fruitless and fruitless expression is sufficient to instruct sexually dimorphic connectivity. fruitless has at least four promoters, each encoding proteins containing both a BTB (Broad complex/tramtrack/bric-a-brac) domain and a zinc finger motif. Alternative splicing occurs at both the 5' and 3' ends, and there are several variants (other than the male- and female-specific splicing patterns). The fruitless gene locus also controls the expression of hundreds of other genes, any subset of which may actually regulate behavior. Name Early work refers to the gene as fruity, an apparent pun on both the common name of D. melanogaster, the fruit fly, as well as a slang word for homosexual. As social attitudes towards homosexuality changed, fruity came to be regarded as offensive, or at best, not politically correct. Thus, the gene was re-dubbed fruitless, alluding to the lack of offspring produced by flies with the mutation. However, despite the original name and a continuing history of misleading inferences by the popular media, fruitless mutants primarily show defects in male-female courtship, though certain mutants cause male-male or female-female courtship.

He attended public schools and earned his Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy from Southwestern Oklahoma State University in Weatherford, Oklahoma in 1968. He was initiated into Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, and was a member of the United States Army Reserves from 1966 to 1971. He married Mary Sue \\"Suzie\\" Nelson in 1963, and the couple had three children, Balynda Karel, Betsy Kecia, and Bradley Kent. On January 31, 1990, Betsy Kecia and Bradley Kent died in a plane crash with friends of the family. After college graduation, Brewster moved to Colleyville, Texas, where, as a licensed pharmacist, he owned and operated the Colleyville Drug until 1977. In 1968 he also began a career as a cattleman and rancher when he started Brewster Angus Farms; as well as owning a real estate business. In the late 1970s he settled in Marietta, Oklahoma. Entry into politics In 1983, Brewster was elected to a seat in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. He was re-elected in 1984, and served until 1990, when he chose, instead, to run for an open seat to the U.S. House of Representatives (District 3 ‚Äî then Congressman Wes Watkins had decided to retire from Congress and run for Governor of Oklahoma). Brewster won the heavily contested Democratic party nomination against Lieutenant Governor Robert S.

The state of Kerala was created on 1 November 1956, long after the Independence of India. Before this, it was three major provinces and several outlying regions under various rulers. Timeline Prior to 1956, Kerala had been divided into three regions: Malabar, Cochin and Travancore. Malabar comprises the northern coastal region around Cannanore and Calicut. This region had been ruled by the Zamorin of Calicut before being conquered by Tipu Sultan. It was then ceded to the British East India Company after the Anglo-Mysore Wars, and annexed to the British Madras Presidency. The coastal town of Mahe remained a French enclave until the early 1950s when it was integrated into the Union Territory of Puducherry. The central region comprised the erstwhile Kingdom of Cochin, administered from Thrissur. The southernmost province was the Kingdom of Travancore, based in the city of Thiruvananthapuram. While Cochin had been a vassal state under the British Raj, Travancore Kingdom was administered under suzerainty. Early in the 20th century, the Mappila Muslims of the Calicut region revolted against the Hindu zamindars and the British Raj.. In the following years, agitations for political rights and a popular government took place in Travancore and Cochin as well. After India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan, Travancore and Cochin, part of India were merged on 1 July 1949 to form Travancore-Cochin. A popular movement known as Aikya Kerala (United Kerala), for the formation of the State of Kerala, gave an impetus to the reorganisation of the state on a linguistic basis.http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi- bin/mmonline.dll/portal/ep/gulfContentView.do?contentId=732939&programId;=1073751464&channelId;=-1073750346&BV;_ID=@@@ On 1 November 1956, the taluk of Kasargod in the South Kanara district of Madras, the Malabar district of Madras, and Travancore-Cochin, without four southern taluks (which joined Tamil Nadu), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act. A Communist-led government under E. M. S. Namboodiripad came to power following the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957.

This support was one of the features that initially distinguished it from other systems.  Fonts = System fonts  The primary system font in OS X El Capitan and above is San Francisco. OS X Yosemite used Helvetica Neue, and preceding versions largely employed Lucida Grande. For labels and other small text, 10 pt Lucida Grande was typically used. Lucida Grande is almost identical in appearance to the prevalent Windows font Lucida Sans, and contains a larger variety of glyphs. MacOS ships with multiple typefaces, for multiple scripts, licensed from several sources. MacOS includes Roman, Japanese and Chinese fonts. It also supports sophisticated font techniques, such as ligatures and filtering. Many of the classic Macintosh typefaces included with previous versions remained available, including the serif typefaces New York, Palatino, and Times, the sans-serif Charcoal and Chicago, Monaco, Geneva and Helvetica. Courier, a monospaced font, also remained. In the initial publicly released version of Mac OS X (March 2001), font support for scripts was limited to Lucida Grande and a few fonts for the major Japanese scripts. With each major revision of the OS, fonts supporting additional scripts were added.  Zapfino  Demonstration of alternate letters, including the full-word ligature for the name of the Zapfino typefaceZapfino is a calligraphic typeface designed by and named after renowned typeface designer Hermann Zapf for Linotype. Zapfino utilizes advanced typographic features of the Apple Advanced Typography (AAT) \\"morx\\" table format and is included in OS X partially as a technology demo. Ligatures and character variations are extensively used. The font is based on a calligraphic example by Zapf in 1944. The version included with macOS is a single weight. Since then, Linotype has introduced ‚ÄúLinotype Zapfino Extra‚Äù which includes the additional ‚ÄúForte‚Äù weight with more options and alternates. Several of the GX fonts that Apple commissioned and originally shipped with System 7.5 were ported to use AAT and shipped with Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3. Hoefler Text, Apple Chancery and Skia are examples of fonts of this heritage. Other typefaces were licensed from the general offerings of leading font vendors.  LastResort  Sample glyphs from the LastResort font.The LastResort font is invisible to the end user, but is used by the system to display reference glyphs in the event that glyphs needed to display a given character are not found in any other available font. The symbols provided by the LastResort font place glyphs into categories based on their location in the Unicode system and provide a hint to the user about which font or script is required to view unavailable characters. Designed by Apple and extended by Michael Everson of Evertype for Unicode 4.1 coverage, the symbols adhere to a unified design. The glyphs are square with rounded corners with a bold outline. On the left and right sides of the outline, the Unicode range that the character belongs to is given using hexadecimal digits. Top and bottom are used for one or two descriptions of the Unicode block name. A symbol representative of the block is centered inside the square. The typeface used for the text cutouts in the outline is Chicago, otherwise not included with macOS. LastResort has been part of Mac OS since version 8.5, but the limited success of Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging (ATSUI) on the classic Mac OS means that only users of macOS are regularly exposed to it.  Lucida Grande  Of the fonts that ship with macOS, Lucida Grande has the broadest character repertoire. This font provides a relatively complete set of Arabic, Roman, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Thai and Greek letters and an assortment of common symbols. All in all, it contains a bit more than 2800 glyphs (including ligatures). In macOS v10.3 (\\"Panther\\"), a font called Apple Symbols was introduced. It complements the set of symbols from Lucida Grande, but also contains glyphs only accessible by glyph ID (that is, they have not been assigned Unicode code points). A hidden font called .Keyboard contains 92 visible glyphs, most of which appear on Apple keyboards.  Font management = System 6.0.8 and earlier  Originally, the Macintosh QuickDraw system software supported only bitmapped fonts. The original font set was custom designed for the Macintosh and was intended to provide a screen legibility. These system fonts were named after large cities, e.g. New York, Chicago, and Geneva. (See Fonts of the Original Macintosh.) Bitmapped fonts were stored as resources within the System file. A utility called Font/DA Mover was used to install fonts into or remove fonts from the System file. Fonts could be embedded into Macintosh applications and other file types, such as a HyperCard stack. Unused fonts were stored in a suitcase file. The ImageWriter printer supported a higher resolution mode where bitmap fonts with twice the screen resolution were automatically substituted for 'near letter quality' printing. (For example, a 24-point bitmapped font would be used for 12-point printing.) This feature was sometimes called two-times font printing. Some later Apple QuickDraw-based laser printers supported four-times font printing for letter quality output. With the introduction of the LaserWriter and support for PostScript-compatible printers, the Mac system software initially supported outline fonts for printing only. These outline fonts could be printed in letter quality at any size. PostScript fonts came with two files; a bitmap font was installed into the System file, and an outline font file was stored in the System Folder. Some of the bitmapped ‚Äúcity‚Äù fonts were automatically replaced by PostScript fonts by the printer driver. Commercial typefaces such as Times and Helvetica began to be distributed by Apple, Adobe Systems and others. The Adobe Type Manager (ATM) system extension allowed PostScript outline fonts to be displayed on screen and used with all printers (PostScript or not). This allowed for true WYSIWYG printing in a much broader set of circumstances than the base system software, however with a noticeable speed penalty, especially on Motorola 68000-based machines. After the release of System 7, Apple added System 6 support for TrueType outline fonts through a freely available system extension, providing functionality similar to ATM. Apple provided TrueType outline files for the bitmapped 'city' system fonts, allowing letter quality WYSIWYG printing. A reboot was required after installing new fonts unless using a font management utility such as Suitcase, FontJuggler or MasterJuggler.  System 7 - Mac OS 9  A highly touted feature of System 7 was integrated TrueType outline font support, which received industry support from Microsoft. Fonts were still stored in the System file but could be installed using drag-and-drop. To install new fonts, one had to quit all applications. Despite this, ATM and PostScript Type 1 fonts continued to be widely used, especially for professional desktop publishing. Eventually Adobe released a free version of their utility, called ATM Light. In System 7.1, a separate Fonts folder appeared in the System Folder. Fonts were automatically installed when dropped on the System Folder, and became available to applications after they were restarted. Font resources were generally grouped in suitcase files. However, rules for storing printer fonts varied greatly between different system, printer and application configurations until the advent of the new Fonts folder. Typically, they had to be stored directly in the System Folder or in the Extensions Folder. System 7.5 added the QuickDraw GX graphics engine. TrueType GX supported ligatures and other advanced typography features. However little software supported these features and PostScript remained the standard. Starting with Mac OS 8.5, the operating system supported data fork fonts, including Windows TrueType and OpenType. In addition, Apple created a new format, called data-fork suitcases. At the same time, support was added for TrueType collection files, conventionally with the filename extension . System versions 7 to 9 supported a maximum of 128 font suitcases, each storing multiple fonts. Starting with version 7.1, Apple unified the implementation of non-roman script systems in a programming interface called WorldScript. WorldScript I was used for all one- byte character sets and WorldScript II for two-byte sets. Support for new script systems was added by so-called Language Kits. Some kits were provided with the system software, and others were sold by Apple and third parties. Application support for WorldScript was not universal, since support was a significant task. Good international support gave a marketing edge to word- processing programs such as Nisus Writer and programs using the WASTE text engine, since Microsoft Word was not WorldScript aware. Beginning in 1996, Apple included Microsoft's Core fonts for the Web, which included common Windows fonts as well as new ones, resolving cross-platform font issues. In 8.5, full Unicode support was added to Mac OS through an API called ATSUI. However, WorldScript remained the dominant technology for international text on the classic MacOS, because few applications used ATSUI.  Mac OS X / macOS  OS X / macOS 10.x supports a wide variety of font formats. It supports most of the font formats used on earlier systems, where the fonts were typically stored in the resource fork of the file. In addition to the data-fork version of TrueType and the Adobe/Microsoft OpenType fonts, OS X also supports Apple's own data-fork-based TrueType format, called data-fork suitcases with the filename extension . Data-fork suitcases are old-style Mac TrueType fonts with all the data from the resource fork transferred unchanged to the data fork. The system also supports the instances created using the \\"multiple master\\" PostScript variant. Fonts in the folder and the folder are available to all users. Fonts stored in a user's folder are available to only that user. Previously, up to OS X 10.4, both Mac OS 9 applications running in the legacy Classic Environment and native applications could access fonts stored in the Mac OS 9 system folder macOS includes a software rasterizer that supports PostScript. Thus eliminating the need for the Adobe Type Manager Light program. The built-in text editing supports advanced typesetting features such as adjustable kerning and baseline, as well as a few OpenType features. Support for QuickDraw GX fonts was dropped in macOS in favor of TrueType fonts using AAT features. Bitmap fonts are only used on screen if there is a corresponding vector form (which is always used in printing). Since OS X v10.3 (Panther), a utility called Font Book has been included with the operating system allowing users to easily install fonts and do basic font management.  Third-party font managers  As desktop publishing took off and PostScript and other outline font formats joined the bitmap fonts, the need for unified font management grew. A number of third parties have created tools, such as Suitcase, for managing font sets. For example, they allowed enabling or disabling fonts on-the-fly, and storing fonts outside of their normal locations. Some even allow the use of Windows .ttf font files natively on systems prior to macOS.  Font technology = TrueType and PostScript  TrueType is an outline font standard developed by Apple in the late 1980s, and later licensed to Microsoft, as a competitor to Adobe's Type 1 fonts used in PostScript, which dominated desktop publishing. The outlines of the characters in TrueType fonts are made of straight line segments and quadratic B√©zier curves, rather than the cubic B√©zier curves in Type 1 fonts. While the underlying mathematics of TrueType is thus simpler, many type developers prefer to work with cubic curves because they are easier to draw and edit. While earlier versions of the Mac OS required additional software to work with Type 1 fonts (as well as at least one bitmap copy of each Type 1 font to be used), macOS now includes native support for a variety of font technologies, including both TrueType and PostScript Type 1. Microsoft, together with Adobe, created an extended TrueType format, called OpenType. Apple, however, continued to develop TrueType. A table, for example, maps composite glyphs to characters and vice versa and adds other features. The table was named after typeface creator Hermann Zapf with permission.  QuickDraw GX  QuickDraw GX was a complete overhaul of the Macintosh graphics system, including the font system, which was rolled out for System 7.5 in 1995. QuickDraw GX fonts could be in either TrueType or PostScript Type 1 formats and included additional information about the glyphs and their purpose. Advanced features, such as ligatures, glyph variations, kerning information and small caps, could be used by any GX enabled application. Previously, they had typically been reserved for advanced typesetting applications. Microsoft was refused a license to GX technology and chose to develop OpenType instead. GX typography and GX technology as a whole never saw widespread adoption. Support for GX was dropped in later versions. AAT covers much of the same ground as OpenType. It incorporates concepts from the Multiple Master font format, which allows multiple axes of traits to be defined and an n-dimensional number of glyphs to be accessible within that space. AAT features do not alter the underlying characters, but do affect their representation during glyph conversion. AAT is supported in IBM‚Äôs open source ICU library, which implements support for AAT fonts under Linux and other open source operating systems.  Hinting technology  Hinting is the process by which TrueType fonts are adjusted to the limited resolution of a screen or a relatively low resolution printer. Undesired features in the rendered text, such as lack of symmetry or broken strokes, can be reduced. Hinting is performed by a virtual machine that distorts the control points that define the glyph shapes so that they fit the grid defined by the screen better. Hinting is particularly important when rendering text at low effective resolution: that is, with few pixels per character. Hinting is part of the TrueType specification, but Apple held three patents in the United States relating to the process: * (filed May 8, 1989) * (filed May 8, 1989) * (filed May 28, 1992) Until they expired, Apple offered licensing of these patents. Microsoft had access to Apple's TrueType patents through cross-licensing. These patents have proven problematic to developers and vendors of open source software for TrueType rendering, such as FreeType. To avoid infringing on the patents, some software disregarded the hinting information present in fonts, resulting in visual artefacts. FreeType developed an automatic hinting engine, but it is difficult to beat the explicit hinting guidelines provided by the typeface designer. The problem of lacking hinting could also be compensated for by using anti-aliasing, although a combination of the two produces the best result.  Subpixel rendering  Expanded version, with explanations. OS X/macOS uses subpixel rendering. Version 10.2 introduced subpixel rendering of type and Quartz vector graphics. This feature is enabled using the System Preferences panel \\"General\\" (10.2) or \\"Appearance\\" (10.3), by setting the font smoothing style to \\"Medium -- best for Flat Panel\\". OS X 10.4 introduced an \\"Automatic\\" setting which transparently chooses either \\"Medium\\" or \\"Standard,\\" depending on the type of main display. The quality of the rendering compared to Microsoft's ClearType and FreeType is contested, and is largely a matter of reader preference. However, Apple's approach differs from that of ClearType and FreeType in that TrueType hinting instructions are discarded for all but the smallest type sizes. This results in more consistency of rendering on Mac OS at the expense of allowing type designers a level of fine tuning through hints.  Fonts of the original Macintosh  Approximately 12 fonts were included with the classic Mac OS (versions 1‚Äì9). With the sole exception of Bill Atkinson's Venice typeface, the fonts included with the original Macintosh were designed by Susan Kare, who also designed most of the Macintosh's original icons. right The Macintosh was an early example of a mainstream computer using fonts featuring characters of different widths, often referred to as proportional fonts. Previously, most computer systems were limited to using monospaced fonts, requiring, for example, i and m to be exactly the same width. Vector- based fonts had yet to appear in the personal computer arena, at least for screen use, so all the original Mac's typefaces were bitmaps. Fonts were available in multiple sizes; those sizes installed on a system would be displayed in the font menu in an outline style. From System 1 through Mac OS 7.6, the default system fonts for Mac OS were Chicago for menus and window titles and Geneva for Finder icons, and they could not be customized. The fonts for Finder icons became customizable starting in System 7. It is accessible in the \\"Views\\" control panel. In Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9, the default system font was changed to Charcoal menus and window titles, but it could be customized in Preferences.  Naming  After designing the first few fonts, the team decided to adopt a naming convention. First, they settled on using the names of stops along the Paoli, Pennsylvania, commuter rail line: Overbrook, Merion, Ardmore, and Rosemont. Steve Jobs had liked the idea of using cities as the names, but they had to be \\"world class\\" cities.  Variants  rightVariants of each font were algorithmically generated on-the- fly from the standard fonts. Bold, italic, outlined, underlined and shadowed variations were the most common, though some applications also included subscript and superscript. Outline, shadow and underline are not always supported by modern software and fonts.  Apple logo  Apple's fonts and the Mac OS Roman character set include a solid Apple logo. One reason for including a trademark in a font is that the copyright status of fonts and typefaces is a complicated and uncertain matter. Trademark law, on the other hand, is much stronger. Third parties cannot include the Apple logo in fonts without permission from Apple. Apple states in the MacRoman to Unicode mapping file that: > On regular US QWERTY keyboards, the logo character can be typed using the > key combination Shift Option K (‚áß‚å•K). In MacRoman, the Apple logo has a hex > value of 0xF0. The Apple logo has not been assigned a dedicated Unicode code > point, but Apple uses U+F8FF () in the Private Use Area. Note that the logo does have a unique PostScript name in the Adobe Glyph List - /apple, mapping to F8FF.

It was intended to have the same radar signature as the Strategic Air Command's B-36 bomber, thereby allowing it to disrupt the enemy's air defenses and dilute their effort to shoot down an incoming bomber fleet. Convair built the first prototype using their own funds, but received an official development contract from the United States Air Force on 16 August 1954. The project designation was MX-2224. When the Air Force decided to put the project into production, it received the designation GAM-71.\\"Convair Development Department Annual Report 1953\\" (1954-05-27), page 7, and \\"Convair Development Department Fourth Annual Report\\" (1955-09-08), page 23. Cited by Jenkins. Both may be found at the Aerospace Education Center, Little Rock, Arkansas. As initially envisioned by the Air Force, one B-36 in the typical three-plane attack formation would be filled entirely with GAM-71s, carrying a total of seven. A total of two decoys could be carried in each bomb bay (except three), and a mixed load was also possible although the Air Force did not specify that it intended to use mixed loads. To fit in the bomb bay of a B-36, the GAM-71 was relatively small; its wings were folded when it was stowed in the bay. To mimic the radar cross-section of the B-36, it carried radar reflectors. In February 1955, glide tests of XGAM-71 prototypes began using a modified B-29 Superfortress as the mothership. However, the program was delayed due to funding issues. Convair also had higher priorities. A total of seven flights were conducted before the program was cancelled in January 1956, an event that Jenkins attributes to the imminent B-36 phase-out.

He also hosts MTP Daily on MSNBC and is the Political Director for NBC News. Before taking the helm of Meet the Press, Todd was Chief White House correspondent for NBC as well as host of The Daily Rundown on MSNBC. He also serves as NBC News' on- air political analyst for NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and Today. Early life and education Todd was born on April 8, 1972, in Miami, Florida, the son of Lois Cheri (n√©e Bernstein) and Stephen Randolph Todd. He is Jewish on his mother's side, and was raised Jewish. He graduated from Miami Killian Senior High School in Kendall, an unincorporated suburban community in greater Miami. Todd attended George Washington University from 1990 to 1994. He declared a major in political science and a minor in music, but did not earn a degree. Career=Political campaigns Before entering the world of political reporting and analysis, Todd earned practical political experience on initiative campaigns in Florida and various national campaigns based in Washington, D.C. While in college, Todd worked for the 1992 presidential campaign of Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and later started working part-time at National Journal's The Hotline. The Hotline From 1992 until March 12, 2007, Todd worked for National Journal's The Hotline, where he was editor-in- chief for six years. As part of his position, Todd also co-hosted, with John Mercurio, the webcast series Hotline TV, consisting of a daily show lasting between three and seven minutes and a weekly show ranging between 20 and 30 minutes. He became a frequent guest on political discussion shows, such as Hardball with Chris Matthews and Inside Politics with Judy Woodruff. NBC News Todd (age 36) covering the 2008 Democratic National Convention for MSNBC. Tim Russert brought Todd to NBC from The Hotline in March 2007. He became the NBC News political director at that time. In this role, Todd often provided on-air political analysis on political discussion shows, including Morning Joe, Hardball with Chris Matthews, Meet the Press, NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, and The Rachel Maddow Show and blogged for MSNBC.com at \\"First Read\\". He also did a weekly Question and Answer (\\"Q&A;\\") session with users at Newsvine. After Tim Russert's death in June 2008, Todd was a candidate to replace him as the host of NBC's Meet the Press, but David Gregory was ultimately selected for the job. On December 18, 2008, NBC announced that Todd would succeed Gregory as NBC News Chief White House Correspondent, partnering with Savannah Guthrie on the news beat. He retained his title as NBC News Political Director and was also named Contributing Editor to Meet the Press. Todd was a focus of an August 2008 Los Angeles Times article paralleling Todd's rise to the rise of cable news networks in coverage of U.S. politics. The article noted the emergence of Todd's fans, deemed \\"Chuckolytes\\". On July 6, 2009, former MSNBC television personality Dan Abrams launched a website service, Mediaite, reporting on media figures. The site ranks all TV-based journalists in America by influence. Todd ranked, as of October 2009, right before Mike Wallace as number five. Todd rose to number two as of December 21, 2011, but fell to 90 as of January 9, 2013. On January 11, 2010, Todd became co-host, with Savannah Guthrie, of The Daily Rundown on MSNBC, airing weekday mornings from 09:00 to 10:00 ET. On August 14, 2014, NBC announced that Todd would take over as the host of Meet the Press beginning September 7, 2014. While remaining as NBC News political director, Todd left his role as chief White House correspondent as well as anchor of The Daily Rundown. On July 23, 2015, MSNBC announced Todd would return to the network with a daily political show called MTP Daily, which was airing weekdays at 17:00 ET. The show was an extension of Meet the Press. Todd continued moderating Meet the Press on NBC. On January 22, 2017, Todd interviewed Kellyanne Conway on Meet the Press, the day after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer accused the media of deliberately under-reporting the crowd size at President Trump's inaugural ceremony. In a response to Todd's question about the claims, Conway said: > \\"Our press secretary, Sean Spicer, gave alternative facts to that [i.e., > Donald Trump's inaugural crowd size], but the point remains that...\\" Todd interrupted her by saying: > \\"Wait a minute.

Merely understanding a question and being unable to answer it is not sufficient to create intellectual need‚Äîintellectual need arises when a person believes the question to be interesting or important, and usually this involves fitting the question into a framework of well-understood ideas. A common critique of certain educational systems is that students are expected to learn facts and ideas in the absence of any intellectual need.

This gives rise to a whole series of problems, ranging from boredom to academic dishonesty.

Ltd that was exhibited at the 48th Geneva Auto Show in 1978. The Dome project was started by Minoru Hayashi in 1975, with the goal of producing sports cars using knowledge gained from auto racing. The Zero was to be their first production road car and Dome planned to produce a limited number for sale in Japan. Despite multiple prototypes and homologation efforts, the Zero was never approved by regulatory bodies for sale in Japan or overseas. As a result, the project was not commercially viable and the Zero never entered series production. Road car prototypes Rear view of Dome Zero prototype Design work on the Dome Zero began in 1976 and the prototype was completed in 1978. The creation of the car was motivated by Hayashi's desire to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a prospect that had full support from his employees, most of whom had professional backgrounds in auto racing. In addition to developing the Zero into a race car, Hayashi intended to fund entry into Le Mans competition by selling cars to the public. The Dome Zero represented a technological leap forward for small-scale Japanese automakers. The unusual design of the Zero required an extensive engineering process, incorporating newly designed components and off-the-shelf items from other Japanese auto manufacturers. It had a strikingly modern wedge-shaped exterior reminiscent of the Lancia Stratos Zero, Lamborghini Countach and Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer. It was rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout with a chassis of square-section steel tube. The 2.8L Nissan L28E SOHC straight-six engine produced . This engine was also used in the Datsun 280Z and 280ZX. With this engine and a curb weight of , the Dome Zero offered a power-to-weight ratio that matched contemporary Porsche models. The prototype also incorporated a ZF 5-speed transmission, independent double-wishbone suspension and four-wheel disk brakes, mounted inboard at the rear. The Dome Zero prototype was completed in time for the 48th Geneva Motor Show in 1978 where its striking design received a lot of attention from various investors and interested buyers. Despite this interest, the manufacturer was unable to achieve Japanese road certification for the prototype. This led to more energy being committed to a second prototype road car for the international market, the Zero P2. It is not clear what the exact reasons were for Zero's failure to achieve Japanese homologation. However, homologation rules were very strict at that time in Japan, and Dome did not have the funds to sustain the length and costly homologation procedure that was routine for well-funded mainstream Japanese auto makers. The Zero's appearance at the Geneva Motor Show resulted in Dome signing several deals with toy manufacturers to license the car's appearance. The funding from these deals enabled Dome to expand their headquarters and continue to develop road and racing cars. Zero P2 Dome Zero P2 The original prototype's failure to achieve Japanese market homologation led to the development of the Dome Zero P2 prototype, a car made specifically for export and sale in countries such as the United States. Hayashi believed this would also allow sales to the Japanese market without regulatory approval. At the time, it was relatively simple for Japanese buyers to obtain \\"export only\\" vehicles via grey market re-imports. The P2 had large front and rear bumpers added (for the US market) and various other structural modifications which altered the appearance of the car. The P2 used the same Nissan L28E engine as the first prototype, but the press reported that turbocharged Nissan or Toyota straight-6 engines were being considered for production cars. The car was shown at the Chicago and Los Angeles motor shows in 1979 and was positively reviewed by Road & Track magazine. When introduced, the Dome Zero P2 was estimated to have a retail price between US$30,000 to US$60,000. Efforts to homologate the P2 for sale in Japan and overseas failed, and it was never produced for commercial sale.  Racing  Following difficulties with road homologation of the Zero, Hayashi decided to develop a race car, the Zero RL. This was intended to help publicize road cars and to realize Hayashi and his employees' ambitions of racing at the 24 hours of Le Mans. The 1979 Zero RL was powered by a Cosworth DFV V8 engine with an aluminum twin-tube monocoque chassis. The dimensions of the car were unusual for a Le Mans prototype, with a very narrow track () and long body (). It is unclear the degree to which the Zero RL was derived from the road Zero, as chassis, body and engine all substantially differed from the road version. The Zero RL first raced at the 1979 6 Hours of Silverstone, driven by Chris Craft and Gordon Spice. Although it was third-fastest in practice, the Zero RL finished 12th of 13. Two Zero RLs raced at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans motor race (#6, driven by Craft/Spice, #7 by Tony Trimmer/Bob Evans) but both failed to finish. Dome returned to Le Mans with new versions of the car in subsequent years. In 1980 the RL-80 was driven by Craft/Evans and also ended with a DNF. This was repeated with the RL-81 in 1981, again driven by Craft/Evans and ending with a DNF. This ended Dome's racing efforts with the Zero RL, although the company would continue racing with other cars. In popular culture *The Dome Zero was the inspiration behind the Transformers Classics series figure of the Generation 1 character Hot Rod in 2006, labeled with the character's alternate name Rodimus due to trademark issues with \\"Hot Rod\\". *A silver Dome Zero is featured as a special prize car in the Xbox game Sega GT 2002 and is drivable from the start of Sega GT Online. *It also makes an appearance in Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 as a prize for getting all gold medals in the International A license.

Founded by Peter Hamilton and Pippin Osborne in 1986 and originally based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Syncros had its heyday in the early 1990s as one of the earliest and most sought-after brands of high end aftermarket off-road bicycle parts. In the late 1990s, the company had financial difficulties and was sold to the large U.S.-based bicycle company GT. Shortly thereafter, GT itself was purchased by Schwinn, which in turn was purchased by Pacific Cycle which is now owned by Dorel Industries in Canada. Pacific was quick to try to capitalize on the Syncros brand name, and used the Syncros label on many cheaply produced OEM parts, severely damaging the brand's reputation. Due to a lapse in trademark registration in the early 2000s, the Syncros brand name was briefly grabbed in the UK by Super Cycles of Nottingham. However, a settlement was reached between Super Cycles and Pacific, resulting in Pacific regaining control of the brand name. Among Syncros' most successful and well known products from their early Canadian period were the Cattleprod and Cattlehead stems, noted for their innovative used of shaped and machined aluminum and titanium at a time when most welded stems were made of steel, and the ProSeries seatpost, featuring an often- copied two-bolt micro-adjust system for saddle positioning. The seat post design, as copied by such companies as Thomson, remains popular today on high end bicycles. Syncros was purchased in 2003 from Pacific by Tom Ritchey, who re-established the brand with Marshall Cant, former Product Manager at Rocky Mountain Bicycles, in the position of Brand Manager. Under the guidance of Tom Ritchey, Syncros has returned to its roots as a leading designer and manufacturer of high end mountain bike components. The original micro adjust 2 bolt seatpost is still manufactured but is the only original product still in the line up. In January 2012, Syncros was purchased by Scott Sports.

After being featured in the Sundance Film Festival in January 2005, it later had a limited theatrical release in November 2005. The film's plot centers on the title character (Schwimmer), an alcoholic whose life is spiraling downward rapidly after his divorce from Linda (Garofalo). Plot Duane Hopwood is a floor manager at Caesars Palace casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. His slip into alcoholism has resulted in his divorce from his wife Linda, who holds custody over their two daughters, Mary and Katie, while Duane holds only visitation rights. One night, a drunken Duane is pulled over after swerving across the road, and it is discovered that Katie is in the backseat. Duane is banned from driving and is forced to borrow a bicycle from Linda as his main means of travel. At the casino, Duane has to deal with a difficult customer, Mr Alonso, whom he illegally gives a few quarters to play a few more slots, resulting in Alonso winning the jackpot prize. Duane later meets Linda and she tells him that Mary would like to talk to him and also informs him that her lawyer has suggested she revoke his visitation rights because of his drunk driving incident, but also expresses her own desire for Duane to refrain from drinking around their children. When Duane returns to the casino, he is taken into his boss Carl's office to explain his part in a disagreement between Alonso and an old lady, Mrs Fillipi, who claims that she was initially using Alonso's machine and that she saw Duane give Alonso the quarters to use it. Duane falsely claims that it was Alonso's own money which was used to win the jackpot; Mrs Fillipi loses the dispute. Duane visits Mary, who tells him she wants to live with him due to Katie calling her fat and Linda's new boyfriend, Bob, encouraging her to go running and lose weight. Duane asks Linda if she will call off her lawyer if he stops drinking altogether. He later confronts her and Bob about the latter's role in Mary's unhappiness; the confrontation escalates and Duane picks up a baseball bat and moves towards Bob, but backs off and leaves after realising the children are watching. That night, Duane later goes to a bar and gets drunk, where he meets Gina, a barmaid. She gives him a ride home, but rejects his drunken advances. However, her car fails to start, so she remains at his house overnight, and although Duane refrains from hitting on her any further, a mutual attraction grows. The next day, Carl shows Duane a tape of him giving the quarters to Alonso. Carl, under pressure from his own boss, is forced to fire Duane. Duane spends the rest of his day getting drunk, before going home and having sex with Gina. However, he admits to her that he still loves Linda, causing Gina to leave. Duane attends a support group for his alcoholism, but becomes too emotional to stay for long. When he later attends the court hearing on his visitation rights, he explains to the judge that he needs to be able to see his daughters because they are the only thing he has left to live for. However, Linda's lawyer produces the bat that Duane had threatened Bob with. Shortly after the hearing, Duane's lawyer, Steve, grimly shows up on Duane's doorstep, saying simply \\"Let's talk.\\" Fearing the worst, Duane drives to Linda's house but finds it empty. He later gets drunk, goes to his friend and housemate Anthony's stand-up gig at the casino and proceeds to ruin it, before being restrained and made to leave. The next morning, Duane apologizes to Anthony for sabotaging his show. Linda turns up and explains that she, Bob and the two girls are moving to South Carolina, where Bob has a job co-running a gym. Duane accepts responsibility for the breakup of the family, and Linda asks him to come and say goodbye before the move, promising to arrange for him to visit the girls in South Carolina once they have settled. The next day, Linda, Bob and the two girls wait at the house for a while, but Duane does not show, so they drive off, only for Duane to cycle up next to the car, wearing a turkey costume that Anthony had used for one of his stand-up acts. After giving them all a proper goodbye, Duane contently watches them leave. Having moved on from Linda, Duane reunites with Gina, with whom he and Anthony attend a thanksgiving meal. The film ends with a scene of a toast, with everyone then drinking wine, except Duane, who drinks water.

Early west-coast trade centres are few in number as they were overshadowed by Kedah. Her nearness to the entrances to the Straits of Malacca ‚Äî and more importantly ‚Äî being on latitude 6¬∞ north of the equator, the same as Ceylon to the south of India, meant that ships sailing the Bay of Bengal in a sea lane heading due east or west between the two were in little danger of becoming lost. The early transpeninsular routeway is part of the sea trade route of the Spice Route for Arab, Persian, Tamil Nadu and India-to-China traders, as the route through the Straits does not seem to have been in general use. Early sea traders from the west, upon reaching the coast, engaged porters to transport goods by raft, elephant and man-carry along the rivers (Kelantan River, Pattani River, Pahang River, Muda River, Bernam River, Muar River, and others) to the opposite coast. The Sungai Muda in particular favoured the development of Kedah. After the 7th century, Srivijaya subjugated Kedah, but due to her fame, Indian sources continue to depict Kedah. Early Kedah also supplied its own tin, and jungle products such as rattan, resin, honey, beeswax, elephants, ivory, areca nuts, sepang wood and black woods, as well as profiting from tax collections. The early history of Kedah can be traced from various sources, from the prehistoric period to the archaeological site of Bujang Valley, the early maritime trade of India, Persia, and the Arabs to the written works of early Chinese pilgrims and early Chinese records, the Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa (known as Kedah Annals) to Al-Tarikh Salasilah Negeri Kedah.  Origins  Austronesians began migrating to the Malay Archipelago approximately 3,500 years before present. It is now accepted that Taiwan is the cradle of Austronesian languages. Some 4,000 years ago, Austronesian began to migrate to the Philippines. Later, some of their descendants started to migrate southwards to what is now Indonesia and eastwards to the Pacific islands. Ancient history Sketch of an 8th- century seafaring ship taken from Borobodur bas relief in central Java, Indonesia Austronesians were great seafarers, colonising as far as New Zealand, Hawaii and Madagascar. In some regions they intermarried with the local inhabitants (Orang Asli), becoming the Deutero-Malays. Possibly as early as the 4th century BCE, Austronesians started to sail westwards in search of new markets for their products. They reached the eastern coast of southern India, initiating trade. Gradually, rulers from western Indonesia began to adopt Tamil-Indian cultural and political models. However, the earliest evidence of such models found so far have been dated to only the early 5th century. Some Greco-Roman merchants in the 1st century CE described huge non- Indian ships coming from the east with rich cargoes, possibly from the Malay Archipelago. This would indicate that the Malay participated actively in Indian Ocean trade, and likely handled much of the traffic between Southeast Asia and India. Three kinds of craft are described by the author of the Periplus: light coasting boats for local traffic, larger vessels of a more complicated structure and greater carrying capacity, and lastly the big ocean- going vessels that made the voyages to Malaya, Sumatra, and the Ganges. Flag of Kedah in the 18th century Medieval history Map of early sea trade route (in red) and the early transpeninsula routeways of the Malay Peninsula Early in the Medieval era, Kedah became part of Srivijaya (the dominant Malay state and a major power in the Indian Ocean trade). This led to rivalries with the Indian states, especially the Chola Empire from the 9th to 13th centuries CE. The Cholas had a powerful merchant and naval fleet in the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. In the early 11th century, Tamil Chola King Rajendra Chola I sent an expedition to attack Kedah (Sri Vijaya) on behalf of one of its rulers who sought his assistance to gain the throne. In ancient Kedah there is an important and unmistakably Hindu settlement which has been known for about a century now from the discoveries reported 1840s by Col. James Low, later subjected to a fairly exhaustive investigation by Dr. Quaritch Wales. Dr. Wales investigated no fewer than thirty sites round about Kedah . The results show this site was in continuous occupation for centuries, by people who under strong South Indian, Buddhist and Hindu influences. An inscribed stone bar, rectangular in shape, bears the Ye Dharma Hetu formula in South Indian characters of the 4th century CE, thus proclaiming the Buddhist character of the shrine near the find-spot (site I) of which only the basement survives. It is inscribed on three faces in Pallava script, or Vatteluttu rounded writing of the 6th century CE, possibly earlier. One of the early inscription stones discovered by James Low, at Bukit Meriam and in Muda River, mention of Raktamrrtika. The word Raktamrrtika means ‚ÄòRed Earth‚Äô (Tanah Merah). Inscriptions, both in Tamil and Sanskrit, relate to the activities of the people and rulers of the Tamil country of South India. The Tamil inscriptions are at least four centuries posterior to the Sanskrit inscriptions, from which the early Tamils themselves were patronizers of the Sanskrit language. In Kedah, an inscription in Sanskrit dated 1086 CE has been found. This was left by Kulothunga Chola I (of the Chola empire, Tamil country). This too shows the commercial contacts the Chola Empire had with Malaya. An indigenous style develops The Tamils coming from Southern India and the local Malays were already using the rounded script, or Vatteluttu writing styles which differed from the Devanagari script of Northern India. Vatteluttu was also commonly known as the Pallava script by scholars of Southeast Asian studies such as George Coedes and D.G.E. Hall. The Tamil script of Vatteluttu later evolved into Old Kawi script which was used in Java, the Philippines, and Bali as well. There are stone inscriptions which indicate that the Kedah region at 400 CE or before was already an established trade centre. One of the early Malay texts include the karma verses refers to a king named Ramaunibham, who may be the first local ruler whose name is recorded in history. The history of this period showed the influence of Indian cultures on the region while the locals in return, influenced the Indians in their living skills on the sea and in the hills.

The novel is the first in the four volume The History of the Runestaff. Plot summary The novel is set at some indeterminate time in a post-nuclear holocaust future, where science and sorcery co-exist and the Dark Empire of Granbretan (Great Britain) is expanding across Europe. Book one Count Brass, Lord Guardian of the Kamarg (a territory that had once been a part of a nation called France), inspects his territories. On his return journey to his castle at Aigues-Mortes he is attacked by a 'baragoon' ‚Äì a swamp monster created from transformed slaves by the previous Lord Guardian ‚Äì and kills it. Count Brass arrives at Castle Brass in Aigues-Mortes and is welcomed by his daughter Yisselda and philosopher-poet friend Bowgentle. Bowgentle argues that the evil of Granbretan should be fought, but Count Brass believes that a united Europe will ultimately know peace. Brass, Yisselda, Bowgentle and the Count's chief lieutenant von Villach attend the opening of the Great Festival, where Count Brass enters the bullring to save the life of the injured bullfighter Mahtan Just. Back at the castle Count Brass receives an emissary from Granbretan ‚Äì Baron Meliadus ‚Äì who attempts in vain to persuade him to give up his knowledge of the various courts of Europe. Baron Meliadus begins to court Yisselda, but she refuses to elope with him knowing that her father would not agree to their marriage. Meliadus attempts to kidnap her, wounding Bowgentle in the attempt, but is defeated by Count Brass and expelled from Kamarg. Meliadus swears an oath on the legendary Runestaff to gain power over Count Brass, gain Yisselda and destroy the Kamarg. Book two In the German province of K√∂ln a rebellion against the Dark Empire led by Duke Dorian Hawkmoon is put down, and the captured Hawkmoon is brought to the Granbretan capital Londra as a prisoner. Hawkmoon is kept in luxurious captivity and offered a bargain for his life and freedom by Baron Meliadus. First to judge his suitability he is tested on the mentality machine by Baron Kalan, and judged sane. Meliadus offers him freedom for himself and K√∂ln if he travels to Kamarg and kidnaps Yisselda from Count Brass: Hawkmoon agrees to the bargain. To ensure Hawkmoon's loyalty a Black Jewel is inserted in his forehead: this jewel will relay Hawkmoon's sight back to Londra, and will eat his brain should Hawkmoon attempt treachery. Before he departs Hawkmoon is granted an audience with the immortal King-Emperor of Granbretan. The plan is that Hawkmoon shall journey to Kamarg dressed as Meliadus, with the story that he drugged him and thus secured passage undetected. Thus Hawkmoon travels from Granbretan across the Silver Bridge to the Crystal City of Parye, Lyon, Valence and finally arrives at Castle Brass. Along the way he catches a glimpse of a mysterious Warrior in Jet and Gold. Count Brass realises the nature of the Black Jewel and by physical and sorcerous means manages to capture the life force of the jewel, rendering it safe. The reprieve is only temporary, but Brass informs Hawkmoon that a sorcerer from the East called Malagigi of Hamadan may possess the power to remove the jewel if Hawkmoon can find him in time. Led by Baron Meliadus the army of Granbretan advances on the Kamarg, harried by sniping attacks led by Hawkmoon. At the battle of the Kamarg the Granbretan army is defeated by the exotic war towers of Count Brass and Meliadus flees. Following the battle Yisselda pledges her love to Hawkmoon and persuades him to seek the sorcerer Malagigi to free himself from the Black Jewel. Book three Hawkmoon rides one of Count Brass's giant flamingos towards the East, but is accidentally shot down by a furry midget crossbreed of a human/mountain giant pairing named Oladahn. Hawkmoon and Oladahn are attacked by a band of brigands but manage to steal two of their goats and ride off. A month later Hawkmoon and Oladahn come upon the freak-show caravan of 900-year-old sorcerer Agonosvos. As an ex-inhabitant of K√∂ln Hawkmoon expects Agonosvos to show loyalty to his duke, but instead Agonsovos kidnaps Hawkmoon to sell him to Baron Meliadus. Hawkmoon is rescued by Oladahn and the pair flee from Agonosvos, who swears vengeance upon them. Hawkmoon and Oladahn take a ship to Turkia, narrowly avoiding ships from the Dark Empire's warfleet, before heading further into Persia. A month later the pair are attacked by a group of 20 Granbretan warriors but are rescued by the mysterious Warrior in Jet and Gold, who accompanies them towards Hamadan. Arriving in Hamadan they find that ruler Queen Frawbra has been ousted by her brother Nahak in league with the forces of the Dark Empire. Hawkmoon finds sorcerer Malagigi but he refuses to help him and, spotting his enemy Baron Meliadus, Hawkmoon flees the city. Hawkmoon persuades Queen Frawbra and her followers to lead an assault to re-take the city, and together with Oladahn and the Warrior in Jet and Gold they attack Hamadan. During the battle Hawkmoon finds himself pitched against Baron Meliadus, and the two fight till they both collapse. Meliadus is later presumed dead, though his body is nowhere to be found. Queen Frawbra's forces succeed in recapturing the city with Frawbra killing her brother Nahak. Malagigi is finally persuaded to help Hawkmoon and succeeds in drawing out the life in the Black Jewel, though Hawkmoon elects to continue to wear the inactive jewel in his forehead as a symbol of hatred. The Warrior in Jet and Gold informs Hawkmoon that he is a servant of the Runestaff, though Hawkmoon dismisses this as a legend. Queen Frawbra offers marriage to Hawkmoon but he refuses and, accompanied by Oladahn, begins the return journey to Kamarg and Yisselda.

The ink cartridges used are also shown. CcMmYK, sometimes referred to as CMYKLcLm or CMYKcm, is a six-color printing process used in some inkjet printers optimized for photo printing. It complements the more common four color CMYK process, which stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key (black), by adding light cyan and light magenta. Individually, light cyan is often abbreviated to Lc or c, and light magenta is represented as Lm or m.  Advantages of CcMmYK over CMYK  The most noticeable result of using light cyan and light magenta inks is the removal of a distinct and harsh halftone or dither dot appearance that appears in prints that use light shades of cyan or magenta on the pure CMYK ink configuration. Usually when printing a dark color the printer will saturate the area with colored ink dots, but will use fewer ink dots to create the effect of a light color. The result is hard to notice with yellow because yellow is perceived as a very light color. However, the individual cyan and magenta ink dots will stand out in a sparse pattern due to their darker color against a white background; the result is undesirable when it is noticed. By using light cyan or magenta, the printer can saturate areas that would typically use halftoning with these inks to remove the look of sparse magenta and cyan dots. The downside is the printer needs approximately twice as much light cyan and magenta ink in areas to achieve the same saturation as pure cyan/magenta which can lead to excess ink usage. The end result, however, is significantly better for some photos. CcMmYK colorants reduce graininess in the middle tone region. This reduced graininess typically improves the photographic appearance of blue skies and some flesh tones.

B3. and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.  Geography of Oregon City  The city of Oregon City includes dramatic changes in elevation. The city's central business district is sandwiched between the Willamette River and a basalt cliff, and is only several blocks wide. At the top of the cliff lies another neighborhood. Indian trails negotiating the cliffside were used originally to connect the two areas beginning with the founding of the town in 1829. Numerous stairways were built in the mid-1860s, but a better transportation solution was needed.  Initial elevator Depiction of original Oregon City elevator The original elevator that was constructed in this area was built as a means of transportation for the residents in the city. The alternative option before the build, would have been walking the stairs from the base to the top of the cliff which consisted of 722 steps. The first bond issued \\"A public elevator at the bluff\\". A bond measure to raise $12,000 for construction was put to voters in July 1912. This levy failed, but a second referendum passed in December of the same year. Sara Chase was the owner of the planned building site. After the city went through the supreme court it was ruled that they could create a right-of-way to the elevator. She agreed to give up a narrow portion of her land. The elevator opened to the public in 1915, delayed by politics. The original elevator was water-powered and took three minutes for the ride. The elevator took three years to build and was constructed out of wood and steel. When the elevator stopped working during the ride, passengers would have to exit through a trap door that had a narrow ladder where the passengers would climb down to safety. Located at the top of the elevator was a catwalk that extended 35 feet stretching across and connecting the elevator to the cliffside. The elevator was so popular that most of the cliffside stairs were removed. The elevator was converted to electric drive in 1924, which reduced the time to 30 seconds. After many years of use in the 1950s it was decided that the elevator would be replaced with a new one.  Current elevator West Linn and the Abernethy Bridge Lower entrance, in Oregon City's historic downtown After 40 years of service, a replacement was authorized by a $175,000 bond by a special election held May 1952. The specifications called for the design to be \\"as plain as possible, without ornament\\". The new elevator, designed by Gordon E. Trapp, engineered by Ervin Aksel S√∂√∂t, and manufactured by Otis Elevator, featured push-button operation and automatic doors, and shortened the ride to about 15 seconds. It was dedicated May 5, 1955 and remains in service today. The machine room was upgraded with a digital controller in 2004. The elevator essentially serves as 7th Street, as both entrances (top and bottom) are on S. 7th Street, a major thoroughfare on both ends. The lower entrance is at the intersection of 7th Street (Oregon Route 43) and Railroad Avenue; a short pedestrian tunnel runs under the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, and into the elevator itself. The upper entrance is accessed from S. High Street, a short distance from the intersection with 7th Street and Singer Hill (a road which descends the side of the cliff, connecting 7th Street on the top with S. 10th Street on the bottom). The upper level includes an observation deck, from which one can see Willamette Falls, the Oregon City Bridge, and the Abernethy Bridge. The elevator has an operator. It is open 7 AM to 7 PM, Monday through Saturday (7 AM to 9:30 PM Wednesday through Saturday from June to September and 7 AM to 8 PM on Wednesdays in October); 10 AM to 7 PM Sunday Pacific Time.According to sign posted at bottom of elevator, see this photo. There is no charge to use the elevator. It was carrying an average of 500 people per day as of 1989, and by 2008 this had grown to nearly 800. Ridership is as high as 1,300 people per day during the city's summer tourist season. Currently the elevator has received a \\"facelift\\" of sorts at the hands of numerous private and public partnerships and a National Endowment for the Arts Our Town grant. The \\"Illuminate Oregon City\\" project has turned the elevator in to a massive video screen, showcasing video and images from area sites. The video mapping program is slated to run until 2015.

Spears used by ancient Tamils in warfare were also commonly referred to by this name. \\"Vetrivel! Veeravel!\\" (\\"Victorious Vel, Courageous Vel\\") was a commonly used battle cry by ancient Tamil kings and soldiers. Hindu mythology According to Hindu mythology, Goddess Parvati presented the Vel to her son Murugan as an embodiment of her shakti or power in order to vanquish the evil asura Soorapadman. According to the Skanda Purana, in the war between Murugan and Soorapadman, Murugan used the Vel to defeat all the evil forces of Soorapadman. When a complete defeat for Soorapadman was imminent, the asura transformed himself into a huge mango tree to evade detection by Murugan. But not fooled by Asura's trick, Murugan hurled his Vel and split the mango tree into two halves, one becoming Seval (a rooster) and the other Mayil (‡ÆÆ‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç-‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç) Tamil (a peacock). Henceforth, the peacock became his vahana or mount and vehicle and the rooster became the emblem on his battle flag. Vel, as a symbol of divinity, is an object of worship in the temples dedicated to Murugan. The annual Thaipusam festival celebrates the occasion when Murugan received the divine Vel from his mother. During this festival, some of the devotees pierce their skin, tongue or cheeks with vel skewers while they undertake a procession towards the Murugan temple. Adi-Vel is a major festival observed in Sri Lanka by Tamil Hindus in the month of July/August, known as Adi. The festival take place cities such as Kathirakamam and Colombo. The alternative interpretation of Vel is that it is a symbol of wisdom/knowledge. It symbolically shows that wisdom/knowledge should be sharp as in the Vel's tip, broad as in the vel's breadth and run deep as in the height. Only such wisdom can destroy the darkness of ignorance.

As late as 12 November 2006 the single remained fifteenth in the Canadian singles chart, having spent a total of 16 weeks in the top 20. The band closed their set with tracks 2 and 3 from this single during their spring 2003 tour, calling the two songs \\"Sm√°sk√≠fa\\" (single) on their set list. Track 2 was originally meant to be a remix of \\"Vaka\\" but it turned out into a different song altogether, although some remnants of \\"Vaka\\"'s melody can still be heard. Track 3 features a solo on piano by drummer Orri P√°ll D√Ωrason. Track 4 is the music looped before and after Sigur R√≥s' live shows. The single was released as a 3\\" limited mini CD, 5\\" CD with DVD, and as a 10\\" limited vinyl gatefold sleeve with an artwork stencil. The 3\\" mini CD was only released in Europe, and is labeled as featuring a new 12 minute track though there are four separate tracks on the disc. The DVD accompanying the 5\\" CD contains the first three music videos the band has made: \\"Svefn-g-englar\\", \\"Vi√∞rar vel til loft√°r√°sa\\" and \\"Vaka\\". The menu screen has a video which the band shot of some birds on a wire, with track four from the single playing.  Music video  Directed by Floria Sigismondi, the music video shows a post-apocalyptic world in which children, attending school, get ready to go outside and play. The children, after having their ears and mouths inspected by the faculty, putting on many layers of clothes as well as ominous gas-masks, exit the school building and emerge to a yard covered in black ash, which falls from the red sky like snow. The children play in the ash, throwing it at one another and making snowmen out of it as well as roughhousing with each other, causing one of the kids to lose her gas mask. Her classmates gather around her as she falls to the ground and eventually closes her eyes. The video won the \\"Best Video\\" award at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards in Edinburgh, Scotland. The music video was originally planned for another song on the album, \\"untitled #4\\" (a.k.a. \\"Nj√≥nsav√©lin\\"). The song is also used extensively in the film After the Wedding.

Tent revivals have had both local and national ministries. The tent revival is generally a large tent or tents erected for a community gathering in which people gather to hear a preacher in hopes of healing, peace, forgiveness etc. In the continental United States, from an administrative perspective tent revivals have ranged from small, locally based tents holding as few as a hundred people to large organizations with a fleet of trucks and tents able to hold thousands. From a relational perspective whether one tent or thousands The Tent Revival has been and is a place where all are welcome to come and meet with the God of Christians. Most tent revivals in the U.S. have been held by Methodist and Holiness Christians, as well as Pentecostal Christians. As radio and television began to play an increasingly important part in American culture, some preachers such as Oral Roberts, a very successful tent revivalist, made the transition to these media. Such pioneers were the early televangelists. Other evangelists who have been noted for their continued use of tents in crusades include David Terrell, R.W. Schambach, Reinhard Bonnke and J. A.

The airport currently has no scheduled commercial flights, with Air New Zealand having ceased flights to the airport in 2013, but it serves as a base for scenic and charter flights to destinations such as Milford Sound and Mount Aspiring National Park. The airport is located beside , on a plateau above the small village of Luggate, and is 10 km south-east of Wanaka township. It was originally a private airstrip owned by Tim Wallis, but in 1985 it became the main commercial airport for Wanaka, replacing Mt Iron Aerodrome. The Warbirds over Wanaka air show has been held biennially at the airport since 1988, regularly attracting crowds of more than 50,000 people. Other attractions, including the National Transport and Toy Museum and the Warbirds & Wheels Museum, are also located at the airport. History Wanaka was originally served by Mt Iron Aerodrome, but by the early 1980s it was clear that a new airport would be needed to serve the town's growing tourism industry, as Mount Iron's runway was not long enough for commercial aircraft, and there was no room to extend it. In 1984, the local council decided to create a new airport for the town by expanding a private airstrip to the south-east of the town, which had been owned by Tim Wallis. On 19 March 2004, Air New Zealand began scheduled services from Wanaka to Christchurch International Airport through its subsidiary Eagle Airways, using 19 seater Beechcraft 1900D aircraft. Larger aircraft, such as the Dash8-Q300, were occasionally used during periods of increased demand, including airshow weekends. Air New Zealand ended scheduled services to Wanaka on 30 January 2013, stating that the route had never been profitable and was showing no signs of improvement. Following the withdrawal of the national carrier, local businesses attempted to run a charter service during the ski season and have asked Air New Zealand to consider re-instating services on a seasonal basis using larger aircraft, although neither of these efforts proved successful. Operations Scenic and charter operators are the main commercial users of the airport, and include Aspiring Air, Glenorchy Air and Southernalpsair. There are also extensive skydiving and helicopter operations, and a large number of general aviation aircraft are based at the airport. Although scheduled services have been withdrawn, Air New Zealand operates limited charter services to the airport during air show weekends. Two aircraft used for scenic flights at Wanaka Airport. Limitations The runway's Pavement Classification Number (PCN) value is too low to cope with heavier aircraft, and the length of the runway prevents certain aircraft from using the airport. However, the airport has consent rights to extend the current runway westward by 500 meters, with an additional 240 meters for standard overrun requirements. The size of the terminal limits the passenger capacity of aircraft serving the airport; larger aircraft (such as Dash8-Q300 and ATR 72) are still able to operate into the airport, but the airport's facilities are not designed to cope with the larger number of the passengers these aircraft carry. The lack of a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon at the airport poses an issue, as few aircraft have appropriate GPS systems to enable non- precision instrument approaches in bad weather.

It was the first feature film directed by Shyam Benegal and the debut of Indian actors Ananth Nag and Shabana Azmi. Ananth Nag was introduced in Ankur by Shyam Benegal after his higher education in Mumbai. The film was shot in Hyderabad. Though Shabana Azmi had acted in other films as well, Ankur was her first release.Shabana Azmi interview Like many others of Benegal's films, Ankur belongs to the genre of Indian art films, or more precisely, Indian Parallel Cinema. The plot is based on a true story that occurred in Hyderabad, apparently in the 1950s. It was filmed almost entirely on location. Ankur has won three National Film Awards and 43 other prizes, both in India and abroad. It was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 24th Berlin International Film Festival. This film includes one whipping scene and more profanity than is usually found in Indian films. Plot Ankur is a complex film that analyzes human behaviour in general and heavily stresses characterisation (though the story is not fictional). The story revolves around two characters, Lakshmi and Surya. Lakshmi (Shabana Azmi) lives in a village with her husband Kishtayya (Sadhu Meher), a deaf-mute alcoholic potter who communicates using gestures. The couple is poor and belongs to the lowly Dalit caste. Lakshmi attends a village festival and prays faithfully to the Goddess, stating that her only desire in life is to have a child. Surya (Anant Nag), the son of the village landlord, has just finished his studies in the nearby city of Hyderabad and arrives back home. Surya's father (Khader Ali Beg) has a mistress named Kaushalya with whom he has an illegitimate son named Pratap. Surya's father claims to have given Kaushalya \\"the best land in the village\\", a gift which serves as both a token of his affection and also keeps Kaushalya quiet and satisfied. Surya is forced by his father into a child marriage with the under aged Saru (Priya Tendulkar), and begins to feel extremely sexually frustrated due to the fact that they cannot have sex until Saru reaches puberty. Surya reluctantly takes over the administrative responsibilities of his share of land in the village. Alone, he moves into a different, older house, and Lakshmi and Kishtayya are sent as his servants. Not long after his arrival, he begins to exert his authority by introducing a number of different laws and measures, many of which are controversial among the village people. Almost immediately, Surya starts to form an attraction towards Lakshmi, and gives her the task of cooking his meals and serving him tea. This does not sit well with the village priest, a man who traditionally delivers food to the landowner, though at a higher price than Lakshmi asks. Surya also hires Kishtayya to ride his bullock cart and run his errands. The following day, he has Kishtayya collect fertilizer from the landlord's house. Surya then uses Kishtayya's absence to flirt with Lakshmi, but she fails to reciprocate. In the meantime, the villagers have begun to gossip, and many (most notably the overseer, Police Officer Patel Sheikh Chand) believe that Surya has already slept with Lakshmi, and will act in the same way that his father did - try to conceal the scandal by giving his mistress a vast plot of land. Kishtayya is caught stealing toddy, after which he is publicly humiliated, and he decides to leave the village due to the embarrassment. In his absence, Surya and Lakshmi sleep together. Some time later, Saru arrives at the village, in order to live with her husband. Saru does not approve of Lakshmi's presence, partly because Lakshmi is a Dalit and partly because Saru has heard the villagers' rumours. The next morning, Lakshmi has morning sickness, and Saru fires her, claiming that she is too sick to work. Many days go by, and eventually Kishtayya returns, having cured himself of his alcoholism and made some money. Lakshmi is overwhelmed with a feeling of guilt, because she believes that she has betrayed her husband. On discovering Lakshmi's pregnancy, he salutes the village goddess at her temple, acknowledging that his wife's wish has been granted. He then decides to return to work and hopefully ride the bullock cart once again for Surya. Surya sees Kishtayya and mistakenly believes that Kishtayya is seeking revenge from him due to his infidelity with Lakshmi. Surya orders three men to grab hold of Kishtayya and then proceeds to whip him with a rope used for lynching. The commotion attracts others, including Sheikh Chand and Pratap, to the scene, and Lakshmi rushes to defend her husband. She angrily curses Surya, then slowly returns home with Kishtayya. In the final scene, after the others have left, a young child throws a stone at Surya's glass window and runs away.Shyam Benegal at filmreference''' Characters The plot is portrayed through the perspectives of Surya and Lakshmi. However, several other major characters and relatively minor characters also enhance the plot, each in his own way. Surya During his wedding, Surya glances first at Kaushalya and Pratap (who are sitting together), then at his own mother. Kaushalya is smiling because her son's wedding is to be held with Surya's, but Surya's mother appears relatively resigned. This is how he always saw marriage: the legitimate wife who suffers and the mistress who prospers. Formerly an inhabitant of the city, he is not accustomed to the ways of the village. When Sheikh Chand expresses his hopes that the village will improve with Surya's presence, Surya's only reply is: \\"Yeah, well, they better.\\" It is for this reason that Surya begins making changes as he deems fit. In addition, Surya's father gives Pratap the \\"best\\" land in the village while Surya lives in an old house. As a result, Surya's second change in the village is to stop water from flowing into Pratap's and Kaushalya's fields. Kaushalya requests a reason from Surya, who points out that he is not her son. She responds, \\"I think of you that way\\" - a remark that makes Surya even more angry. At least two days later, Pratap asks Surya to restore the water flow into his fields. When Surya refuses, Pratap threatens to report Surya's actions to their father. Surya initially dismisses this warning but is surprised when his father eventually does show up. Surya tries to defend his actions but is unsuccessful in doing so. Before his father arrived (but after Pratap's visit), Surya had promised to take care of Lakshmi \\"forever.\\" However, when he finds out that she is pregnant, he coaxes her to abort the child and refuses to take responsibility over the baby. She refuses to have an abortion because she always wanted a child, so Surya tells her to leave. When Saru announces to Surya that she has caught Lakshmi stealing rice, he warns Lakshmi that he would have whipped her until she began bleeding if she were not a woman. Then he forbids her to come near his house again. Sheikh Chand requests Surya to consider Lakshmi's situation more thoroughly. Surya refuses while nervously wiping his hands. Lakshmi Lakshmi readily serves Surya as a servant, albeit at a low wage. That is what she is expected to do. However, the villagers did not realize that Surya would find her attractive and ask her to do additional chores. She often appears to be worried: first about Kishtayya's alcoholism, then about where he has gone and how to live without him, and finally, about her loyalty to him. It is clear that Lakshmi had an extended affair with Surya which seems to have started when she places her head on Surya's shoulder and the scene ends abruptly. After that there are several occasions when we see her dressing up or her lying next to Surya in bed. Rajamma Two days after Kishtayya's departure, Lakshmi witnesses (from a distance) two men dragging a village woman to the panchayat. The woman, Rajamma, refuses to go while the men accuse her of \\"dishonouring our brother.\\" At the panchayat, the men reveal that she has committed adultery. Her brothers-in-law argue that they have \\"two wells\\" and \\"two crops a year,\\" maintaining that Rajamma could not want more. Rajamma explains that she wants a child (Lakshmi immediately realizes the similarity to her own desires). \\"My not having a child,\\" she claims, \\"is because of him, my husband.\\" She threatens suicide if she is forced to live with her husband, Yadgiri. When asked what his argument is, Yadgiri simply allows the judges to make a decision. Before Rajamma expresses her views, the judges reprimand her for disgracing \\"your house, your family, and your village\\" by living with another man. At this point, Surya looks at Lakshmi, who already lives with him. The final verdict is that Rajamma must live with her husband and that Yadgiri's brothers should compensate if she is dissatisfied. After the trial, Rajamma commits suicide. Lakshmi can identify closely with Rajamma. After Rajamma's suicide, she tells Surya that she wishes to return to Kishtayya. However, she realizes that this is impossible, and Surya promises to look after her. Saru As soon as Saru arrives, she bows before Surya, and Lakshmi garlands her. She immediately begins adding decorations to the house, namely a frame with the message \\"Good Luck\\" (in English) and a picture from her wedding. She also puts a garland around a framed picture of two Hindu deities, and prays to them. She knows about Surya's affair with Lakshmi, but she is puzzled when she sees Lakshmi cursing Surya since she does not know about Kishtayya. Saru is rarely shown smiling until she sacks Lakshmi. In fact, the very first day, just as Surya is hanging up the wedding picture and Lakshmi is walking into her room, she points out Lakshmi's presence by silently staring at him and nodding slightly towards Lakshmi's room. When Surya tries to avoid discussion of the affair by criticizing how he looks in the picture, Saru does not speak to him and does not even allow him to touch her. That same night, she suggests that he sack Lakshmi; an unconcerned Surya tells her to do as she wishes. Saru is a supporter of the caste system. When Lakshmi makes tea for the new couple, Surya accepts his glass. Saru, on the other hand, refuses hers before expressing her surprise at Surya (not realizing that he was the one who had Lakshmi make tea in the first place). She then refuses to have \\"anything she [Lakshmi] has touched.\\" Surya's father If not for Surya's father, Surya would have been far less likely to meet Lakshmi, change the village's rhythm of life, and cause a revolt. However, he insists that Surya control his share of land. He does not believe in hiring others to administer the land for him because he thinks they will \\"get rich at our cost\\" and seize the land for themselves. Kaushalya Though she always smiles when speaking to Surya, Kaushalya does not like him very much. In his absence, she calls him a \\"spoiled brat\\" and a \\"mere boy.\\" She always calls him her \\"son\\", as if his legitimate wife was nonexistent. She has become rich at Surya's mother's cost. Many, if not all, of these facts provoke Surya to try to put an end to her progress by cutting off the water supply. Pratap Pratap does not seem to consider Surya's feelings about Kaushalya very thoroughly. He also does not hesitate to enter his half-brother's house without permission. However, he is perhaps more enraged than any of the other villagers when he observes the injured Kishtayya at the end of the film. In that scene, he appears to stay and stare at Surya's window longer than any of the other villagers. Sheikh Chand Sheikh Chand (played by Agha Mohammed Hussain) is the Muslim overseer of the landlord's property. When Surya arrives in the village, he is initially hopeful that the new arrival might improve the village. These hopes seem to disappear within a day: Surya monopolizes the toddy trade and demands that Sheikh Chand guard the toddy. Sheikh Chand promises to punish anyone who steals the toddy severely, but once Surya leaves, the expression on his face changes from a smile to a straight face. Kishtayya Kishtayya is strong both physically and mentally. It is because of Kishtayya's physical strength that Surya is afraid of him, and his mental strength is demonstrated by his ability to overcome alcoholism (facilities for alcoholics were generally not available in India during the 1950s, particularly not in villages). Surya, however, exploits Kishtayya's weaknesses (i.e. the fact that Kishtayya is deaf-mute, alcoholic, poor, and a Dalit). Kishtayya's alcoholism allows Surya to humiliate him so that Surya can be closer to Lakshmi. Kishtayya's physical handicap prevents him from understanding what is happening when Surya proceeds to beat him in the end, and his poverty and caste do not permit him to complain about Surya's actions. In spite of his weaknesses, Kishtayya uses his job as a cart-driver to drive willing schoolchildren to their homes at the end of the day. The Boy One of the characters is an anonymous boy who first appears in the scene in which Kishtayya steals toddy. The boy is the one who reports the theft to Surya; from that day until the end of the film, they seem to be on friendly terms (just before Kishtayya is beaten, the boy is shown flying kites with Surya). However, at the end of the film, he suddenly turns against Surya by breaking his window. Motif of the seedling In addition to being the title of the film, the seedling makes various appearances (both physically and metaphorically) in the film and is used as a motif. * In the first scene, a village woman appears to offer the seedling of a fruit to the goddess while Lakshmi prays for a child. (As she offers the seedling, it seems that the first word she utters is pandlu which means \\"fruits\\" in Telugu.) * The seedling may also represent the child that Lakshmi desires. * Not long before Kishtayya is caught stealing toddy, there is a scene in which Lakshmi is cooking dinner. Suddenly, near the doorstep, she notices a pot containing a seedling. The implication is that Kishtayya has gone out to drink again and has left Lakshmi the seedling as compensation. She steps outside the doorstep, finds Kishtayya staggering home, and breaks the pot in front of him before returning inside. * Metaphorically speaking, the seedling of popular rebellion sprouts at the end of the film (the villagers begin to protest the village's social hierarchy). Social issues Many reviewers suggest that Ankur makes a statement concerning one particular social issue. In reality, it addresses several, including (but not necessarily limited to) those listed below: * Alcoholism: Kishtayya used to be a \\"good potter,\\" Lakshmi tells Surya. However, demand for his clay pots decreased as aluminium vessels were becoming increasingly popular. As he could not sell many pots, he began to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Lakshmi claims that Kishtayya is a \\"good man\\" whose \\"only fault is drinking.\\" Two scenes show Kishtayya returning home after a night of drinking while Lakshmi cooks dinner. In both scenes, a worried Lakshmi scolds her husband, trying to discourage him from drinking. Kishtayya's only response is to go to bed on a hungry stomach. He does not overcome his alcoholism until he abandons Lakshmi. * Casteism: The film provides a deeper insight into the ugliness of Indian caste system, particularly visible in the rural areas.Casteism through Benegal's eyes Times of India, 12 November 2007 The villagers expect Lakshmi to work as Surya's servant. However, being a Dalit, tradition forbids that she cook meals for Surya. Thus, when Surya asks Lakshmi to cook his meals, the villagers (particularly the Hindu greengrocer) begin to disapprove of him. When Saru moves to Surya's house, she refuses to touch \\"anything that she (Lakshmi) has touched.\\" * Rich vs. poor: The first time Lakshmi is shown scolding Kishtayya, she claims that she is obliged to commit petty theft in order to care for herself and her husband. She initially steals no more than three handfuls a day of rice from Surya. Some time after she is dismissed from her job, she returns to Surya's house to look for work again. Saru offers Lakshmi food instead of work, and Lakshmi attempts to steal a little more rice than usual (as she is pregnant). Saru catches her red-handed as she brings a meal, then forces her to put back the rice, saying, \\"You people starve because you steal.\\" In the end, Lakshmi refuses \\"your [Surya's] jobs, your money, anything of yours!\\" thus suggesting that poverty does not concern her in this context. * Parent vs. child: The relationship between Surya and his father appears to be rather unsteady; neither of them smiles when they are together. Surya tries to spend more time with his friends by asking his father for permission to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree. However, his father (who already knows what Surya is trying to do) refuses him permission and forces him to marry Saru. Little does Surya's father initially know what the consequences of these actions of his will be. * Sexual drive: Surya, Lakshmi, and Rajamma have all engaged in adultery. Each has his own reasons. Surya is sexually frustrated, and Rajamma wants a child. Lakshmi's reasons are unclear, for Ankur does not reveal when her affair with Surya began. (See the Unanswered Questions section of this article.) * Changing loyalties: Saru is perhaps the only character who does not change her loyalty to something (in her case, tradition). Surya pretends to be loyal to Lakshmi but abandons her once she becomes pregnant. Lakshmi is loyal to her husband until she sleeps with Surya. We do not know whether Kishtayya has remained loyal to his wife in his absence (though it seems improbable considering his general respect for Lakshmi, adultery on his part might explain why he forgives her). Certainly, he has abandoned his loyalty to alcohol but remains supportive of his wife. * Religious differences: This less predominant issue characterizes the relationship between two of the minor characters, namely Sheikh Chand and the greengrocer. Their religious differences encourages them to play nonviolent practical jokes on one another. The greengrocer tricks Sheikh Chand into getting Surya's car out of the mud; later, Sheikh Chand reciprocates by stealing a few betel leaves from the greengrocer. * Dowry: This issue is a relatively minor one in the film. It is addressed only in one quote, when Lakshmi explains why she married Kishtayya. After Surya asks why Lakshmi chose to marry a \\"drunken deaf-mute,\\" she answers that no one else would marry her as she could not afford to pay dowry. She then points out that Kishtayya was not yet a drunkard. Production The characters in Ankur often speak the Dakhani language, a variant of Standard Hindi-Urdu spoken in Southern India (particularly in the Hyderabad area). For example, when Surya asks Lakshmi where Kishtayya is, she responds, \\"Mereku naheeN maaluum\\" in Dakhani instead of \\"Mujhe naheeN maaluum\\" (I don't know) in Standard Hindi. (See Muslim culture of Hyderabad for more examples of Dakhani.) Shabana Azmi, a fresh graduate from Film and Television Institute of India, Pune (FTII), wasn't the first choice for the role of Lakshmi. Benegal had earlier approached Waheeda Rehman, Anju Mahendru and Sharada, all of whom had refused his offer. Thereafter, he chose Shabana Azmi; he had to alter the script a bit to suit the younger-looking Lakshmi.Ankur Review Upperstall.com. Benegal was initially reluctant to hire Azmi, thinking she was a model and perhaps unsuitable for the role of a humble villager. Music Being an Indian art film, Ankur is a \\"straight\\" feature without musical sequences. However, Surya plays parts of two records over the course of the film. The first recording consists of the third stanza of the song \\"Yahi To Hai Woh\\" by Mohd. Rafi from Solvan Saal (1958). The fourth stanza is then played in the background while Surya talks to Lakshmi. The film also includes several scenes in which villagers sing folk songs, mostly in Telugu.

The school enrolled 1,044 students in the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, who primarily come from feeder schools in the Scottsdale Unified School District. History Coronado High School, named for the Spanish conquistador Francisco V√°squez de Coronado, opened in fall 1961 as a public comprehensive high school, grades 9-12, with emphasis on college preparatory and vocational/technical curriculum. The school mascot is the Coronado Don, don being the name for a Spanish nobleman. Architecture Ralph Haver, the noted Phoenix mid-century architect, designed the original school, mostly made of pre-cast concrete.http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/2011/09/20/20110920scottsdale- coronado-high-school-50th-anniversary-quiz-prog.html Haver also designed numerous public and commercial buildings, as well as tract homes and private residences in Phoenix and Scottsdale, during the 1950s and 1960s. The neighboring residential community of Town and Country, also featuring classic contemporary ranch style tract homes designed by Haver, was designated as historic by the City of Scottsdale in 2005. Coronado High was overhauled by DLR Group for the 2008‚Äì09 school year, though the white folded plate motif was kept in the new structures as a nod to the former appearance. Shield The Heart Shield, the original logo of the school The Coronado Shield has been a symbol of the school for many years. It was originally designed by Joe Gatti, who also created another symbol of the school, the Seven Arts mosaic on the auditorium. Gatti was an art teacher at Coronado from its opening in 1961 until 1984. He felt that this shield design fit the idea of Coronado's namesake. Notable alumni *J. D.

It was used as the high school that Bill and Ted attended in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, although the high school in the movie was named San Dimas High School (San Dimas was actually the site of the Bill & Ted sequel). The movie finale (Bill and Ted's final on-stage report with historical figures) was filmed in Coronado's auditorium which was torn down for remodeling in 2006. Disney used the school twice, as Coronado was the site of filming for ABC's Not Quite Human, a film featuring Jay Underwood, Robyn Lively and Alan Thicke. Another movie, Just Perfect (featuring Jennie Garth), was filmed for the Mickey Mouse Club in 1989. The final football game shown in the movie was actually between Coronado's varsity and junior varsity teams. The 1985 movie Just One of the Guys, starring Joyce Hyser, was filmed at the now-demolished Scottsdale High School as well as at Coronado High School. Scenes for the made-for-TV movie \\"Down Will Come Baby\\" starring Meredith Baxter was filmed on the campus in 1998.

Overview All his films are made in Australia with predominantly Australian casts. He has made only three films in two decades, yet they have been some of the most critically acclaimed works in Australian cinema during that time. He is famous for his one-take shoots and use of natural light. He makes commercials in between films. Early life Lawrence was born in London, England, the son of a painter who painted the royal coaches at Buckingham Palace, and later spray painted London buses for double the salary. He moved to Australia with his family in 1958 at age 11 and they settled in Victor Harbor, South Australia after spending three years in a migrant hostel in Gawler.Janet Hawley, \\"Ray of truth\\", The Age, 24 June 2006, Good Weekend, p. 24 When he left school he moved to Sydney and began working in advertising. He worked for a number of years in London producing commercials. Then he returned home, established Window Productions with Glen Thomas, and became one of Australia's top directors of TV commercials.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p172-173 Career Lawrence's unique cinematic style has established him as one of the most respected dramatic directors of contemporary Australian cinema. While only producing three films in his 25-year career as a feature film director, all of his features have meditated around the slippery and often painful nature of 'real' human interaction. It is Lawrence's ability to illustrate intensely personal interactions between characters as they navigate through the less than 'cinematic' terrain of real life situations that has engaged his audience and earned the respect among cinema goers and critics alike. His second feature, Lantana (2001), is one of the highest grossing Australian films ever made winning critical and popular recognition including Best film, Australian Film Institute (AFI) Awards. Examining human relationships and the notion of trust, the film weaves the mysterious disappearance of a wealthy psychiatrist across the fabric of three Australian families, with each family representative of a different social class existent in contemporary Australian society.Lantana scoops AFI awards Private life His son, Ben Lawrence, is also a film director.

The player must first examine evidence, then interview witnesses, and finally go to trial to secure a conviction. The program was developed by Peter Adair and Haney Armstrong of Adair and Armstrong. The promotional tagline was \\"Someone's dead. Someone's lying. Can you prove Murder One?\\" Plot James Tobin is a struggling artist in San Francisco who owns an art gallery with his business partner, Zachary Barnes. For some time, the gallery is a lucrative business. However, after a new series of Tobin's paintings fail to sell, the gallery struggles financially. Tensions rise further when a burglary occurs at the gallery and Tobin's new series of paintings are stolen. During this time, unrelatedly, Barnes and Tobin's girlfriend, Ruby Garcia, have a one-night stand. One morning a few weeks later, an incident occurs between Tobin and Barnes at the gallery and Tobin shoots Barnes dead. Tobin claims that he killed Barnes in self-defense following an argument and a struggle. The police do not accept this claim and believe the killing to be an act of premeditation. They believe that the burglary several weeks before Barnes' death was carried out by Tobin himself, that he stole his own paintings to gain the insurance money to save the struggling gallery. Saying that Tobin killed Barnes not only to cover up his crime but also as an act of revenge for Barnes' affair with his girlfriend, the police arrest Tobin and charge him with grand theft and murder in the first degree. Three months later District Attorney Sterling Granger is summoned by Inspector Looper who provides him with substantial evidence with which he has to establish concrete proof that Tobin is guilty of the charges and present them at court, while trying to withstand doubts cast by Tobin's expert Defense Attorney Cynthia Charleston. Gameplay The game is played through the eyes of San Francisco District Attorney Sterling Granger. The game begins with a video clip in which the homicide is announced on the news. After that, police detective Inspector Looper briefs the player on some of the facts of the case that have been discovered in her investigation. (Like all character interactions in this game, the briefing by Looper is full motion video, with the player having a first-person view.) The player is then taken to Granger's office, where the player can choose to examine various evidence documents and photographs; view videos from Looper's interrogations of Tobin, Ruby, Barnes' wife Yvonne, or gallery employee Simon Lee; interview each of them (except Tobin) directly; or go to trial. The main gameplay is the pre- trial interviewing and the direct or cross-examination of witnesses at trial. During interviews (and during the trial), the player is given a choice of questions to ask, each of which elicits a different response from the witness. Based on these questions and their responses, new questions become available. Only if the player asks the proper questions (and, sometimes, in the proper order) will the necessary information come out during the trial to secure a conviction against Tobin. (For example, if the player fails to make Ruby comfortable about discussing her affair with Barnes during the initial interview, she may deny ever having the affair when asked about it at trial.) In asking questions, the player also has to deal with the witnesses' different personality types and their relationships with Barnes, with Tobin, and with each other. (For example, Barnes' widow Yvonne, who works as the press secretary for San Francisco's mayor, speaks in a relatively calm and dignified manner, whereas Tobin's girlfriend Ruby is quick-tempered and can become very hostile.) During the trial portion of the game, a video clip of a local newscast follows each witness' testimony. In those clips, reporters analyze the prosecutor's performance (and, thus, the player's performance) in the examination of that particular witness. The player's examination of a witness also can have an effect on the kinds of questions asked by Tobin's attorney and the witness' response to them. Based on the player's overall performance, there are several possible outcomes to the game. The worst possible outcome is that the case is simply dismissed. The game may also end in Tobin's acquittal or with Tobin being convicted of lesser crimes (i.e. manslaughter or second- degree murder), with or without a grand theft conviction. The best possible outcome is a conviction for both grand theft and first-degree murder. Development This game served as a departure from what Broderbund usually published, and was the first in their catalogue to tackle human drama and film-making in this way. The San Francisco City Hall Courthouse was used for the courthouse setting, and the actors were filmed separately in front of a bluescreen. The shot was composited later using computer software. San Francisco assistant district attorney Al Giannini was a legal consultant during the script writing and filming. Reception GameSpot praised its \\" originality and accessibility\\". CD-Rom Today wrote \\" The interface is blessedly simple, the writing is snappy and realistic, and the acting is generally believable and only occasionally hammy. And the graphics are well- designed and rendered.\\" From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and Computer Games wrote that the game is less about solving the mystery about more about making a strong case. Often one may know the truth, but the witness hasn't yet been convinced to tell the truth on the stand. Therefore, the game is more about emotions and relationships, rather than facts. In the 1st Degree was nominated for the Codie awards' 1996 \\"Best Adventure/Role Playing Software\\" prize, which ultimately went to Oregon Trail II. It was the second-place finalist for Computer Game Reviews 1995 \\"Best FMV of the Year\\" award, which went to Phantasmagoria. The editors wrote, \\"In the 1st Degree was able to captivate the player with FMV sequences that looked as good as anything from a highly publicized murder trial of several months ago.\\" Legacy In 1995, In the 1st Degree was adapted into a novel of the same name by screenwriter Domenic Stansberry (under the pen name \\"Dominic Stone\\"), who had worked on the screenwriting for the game.

In 2003 special operations troops were armed with the 7.62 mm 6S11 sniper system comprising the SV-98 sniper rifle (index 6V10) and 7N14 sniper enhanced penetration round. The rifle has been used in combat during operations in Chechnya. Design details The SV-98 sniper rifle is based on the Record full bore sport shooting rifle series also made by Izhmash. Izhmash also produces Record target rifles chambered in .308 Winchester, 7.62√ó54mmR and .338 Lapua Magnum which are similar to the SV-98. According to the manufacturer the SV-98 sniper rifle is designed to engage various targets at a range up to . The heart of the SV-98 is a cold-hammer forged receiver and a cold-hammer forged free-floating heavy barrel which can be chrome lined to order. The manually operated bolt action has a rotating bolt with three symmetrically-spaced frontal lugs. The barrel has 4 grooves right-hand rifling and a 320 mm (1 in 12.6 in) twist rate and features a threaded muzzle which can accept the standard provided conical birdcage- pattern muzzle brake or a specially designed 23db (A) suppressor that requires the use of subsonic ammunition. The rifle was developed to fire 7.62√ó54mmR 7N1 standard sniper, 7N14 enhanced penetration sniper or \\"Extra\\" match grade sports cartridges. The SV-98 is equipped with iron sights (shrouded front and an up to in increments adjustable tangent-type rear sight) and a Picatinny rail on top of the receiver that can be used to mount Russian and foreign made telescopic sights and other aiming optics with an appropriate rail interface system. According to several internet sources, a standard telescopic sight used on this rifle is the PKS-07 7√ó fixed-magnification scope. The manufacturer however states the Russian made 1P69 3-10√ó42 variable magnification telescopic sight with a sighting range of up to is used as standard day light optical sight. The 1PN113 3.7√ó fixed magnification night sight is used as the standard low light optical sight. The ambidextrous laminated plywood stock features an adjustable butt plate that can be regulated for length of pull, height and pitch and has a height and length adjustable cheek comb. A fiber glass reinforced polymer stock was also offered. A front attachment point is situated at the foreend for mounting an integral folding bipod and the stock is prepared for mounting an integral rear monopod. The length of both bipod legs is independently adjustable and the rear monopod folds into the stock. A carrying handle can be attached to the stock in order to prevent the operator from grasping the rifle by its aiming optics during quick position changes or on the march. The trigger mechanism displays an adjustable trigger pull of . The safety lever is located behind the bolt handle and the safety locks the trigger, immobilizes the sear and prevents the rotary bolt from turning. The staggered (or double) column detachable box magazine is made out of glass fiber reinforced nylon with metal inserts and holds 10 rounds. To reduce recoil, jump, flash and sound signature, the SV-98 can be supplied with a TGP-V tactical suppressor. An anti-mirage strap can be fixed between the front and rear sights. Internet sources report differing information regarding the attainable accuracy of fire, though the quality of the ammunition used is often mentioned as a very important factor in obtaining good accuracy. Variants= Upgraded SV-98  Multiple SV-98s placed for the Armourers Day sniping competition Kalashnikov SV-98 fitted with a 1P69 Hyperon 3‚Äì10√ó42 optical scope, which features an adjustable lightweight aluminum skeleton type stock Record .338 Lapua Magnum rifle (bottom) In 2013 an upgraded SV-98 variant was developed by Izhmash featuring an adjustable aluminum skeleton type stock. Izhmash expects the upgraded variant to be more economical to produce and offer improved maintainability and accuracy of fire. It has been tested by Izhmash since 2013. The upgraded sniper rifle features an aluminum alloy receiver providing enhanced performance and lower cost of production. The adjustable stock is ambidextrous. The buttstock length is adjustable and the position of the butt plate and comb adjusts by length and height. It also features a bipod in the forearm and a leg in the buttstock; adjustment of each leg is independent. In travel position the bipod is folded into the forearm, and the rear leg ‚Äì into the buttstock, and, thus, do not enlarge the overall dimensions of the weapon. The upgraded SV-98 can also be equipped with a tactical suppressor to reduce the sound blast, blowback and flash when it is being fired. It also features a Picatinny rail on top of the receiver to mount Russian-made and foreign-made optics. It comes with a standard 1P69 optical sight with a 3‚Äì10√ó variable magnification and is equipped with an open sight. The rifle safety catch locks the trigger, inerts the sear and prevents the rotary bolt from turning (unlocking). In 2017 Kalashnikov Concern took over production of the SV-98. It has a lightweight skeleton stock made of aluminium alloys, a Picatinny rail for optical scopes on the top of its upper receiver, a folding stock, and an integrated bipod. It is chambered for the 7N1 or 7N14 7.62√ó54mmR sniper cartridges and has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds. The sniper rifle has a combat weight of 7.8 kg, a length of 1,200 mm (including a barrel of 650 mm), and an effective firing range of 1,000 m. It can be equipped with a suppressor instead of the organic muzzle brake to reduce the sound blast, blowback and flash when it is being fired. It is primarily intended for the snipers of the Russian Ground Forces. According to a source in the local defence industry, the military has ordered a small batch of SV-98 sniper rifles for operational test and evaluation.

A hasty attack can be executed while the troop is engaged with a zone reconnaissance mission or movement to contact.\\" The hasty attack stands in contrast to a deliberate attack, an offensive mission conducted to defeat enemy forces in prepared defensive positions or strongpoints, employing detailed tactical planning and rehearsal of the attack, or a raid which is an attack into enemy territory for a specific purpose, with no intent to gain or hold terrain, and where the unit returns to friendly lines after the attack. A textbook example of a hasty attack was the Battle of 73 Easting. There the cavalry troop commander Captain H. R. McMaster upon advancing into an Iraqi Armor Brigade assembly area ordered his unit to advance and engage the Iraqis, exploiting surprise and momentum to win a decisive victory over a much larger and heavily armed force.  Critical tasks  In executing a successful hasty attack, the following tasks are considered critical: * Reconnaissance to determine the size, composition, and orientation of the enemy force. * Determining the level of support the objective enemy force may receive from other nearby units. * Finding a high-speed concealed approach into the enemy's flank(s). * Establish a maneuver element within the unit to move to a position of advantage over the enemy and attack him by direct fire. * Establish a base-of-fire element within the unit to defeat or suppress enemy anti-tank weapons with long-range direct and indirect fires before the maneuver element begins its attack. * Isolate the enemy's forces from other mutually supporting units with indirect fires. * Attack the enemy by fire or by fire and movement, and defeat him. * Once the attack is completed, immediately establish hasty defensive positions and observation posts on high-speed avenues of approach to the position.  Hasty attack techniques  Successful hasty attacks rely much upon the commander's sense of timing in executing the critical tasks in the proper sequence. The ability to synchronize, concentrate and apply all the different forms of offensive capability available against the enemy at the right times and places is crucial to a good hasty attack. The decision to conduct a hasty attack is usually made after reconnaissance of an enemy force shows that the element of surprise has presented a compelling opportunity or winning requires a quick strike with little preparation. According to FM 17-97, tactics for conducting a hasty attack have three common features: * Known or suspected enemy heavy weapons are suppressed and destroyed with direct and/or indirect fire before the maneuver force is committed. * The enemy is forced to fight in two directions. * The enemy is suppressed and unable to react.  Preparing for hasty attack  The commander may first become aware of the possibility for hasty attack when scouts in contact with the enemy recommend a hasty attack as a course of action. The unit commander may then decide to execute the recommended course of action. In that case the commander will then issue orders to position forces to execute an attack with minimal planning and preparation. Leading up to the hasty attack, the reconnaissance element in contact with the enemy will generally continue to reconnoiter the enemy's position and perform their tasks. Often one section will remain in contact with the enemy while another will continue its reconnaissance up to a limit of advance established by the commander. Both reconnaissance elements are looking for the presence of other enemy units, to the flanks or rear, supporting the objective enemy unit. Immediately prior to the attack the commander may choose to direct the battle from the position of the reconnaissance element in overwatch. In a hasty attack often a fire support team will be positioned in such a way that allows it to oversee the battlefield to control the indirect fire. Any organic fire support, like mortar sections, will establish firing positions and prepare to suppress the enemy position. The size and strength of the enemy may require the use of tank and/or anti-tank units.

It is located in Bhadravati, an industrial town and taluk in the Shimoga District of Karnataka state, India. It is situated at a distance of about 255 km from the state capital Bangalore and at about 20 km from the district headquarters Shimoga. The art historian Adam Hardy categorizes the architectural style as a triple shrine (vimana) construction with two \\"exceptional\\" stellate forms, one for the shrine facing west and one for the shrines facing north and south, the basic building material being Soap stone. The temple stands on a jagati and the outer wall exhibits a two tier decorative plan.Hardy (1995), p.325 The monument is protected by the Karnataka state division of Archaeological Survey of India. Temple plan According to art historian Gerard Foekema, being a triple vimana (cella or shrine) construction it qualifies as a trikuta, which less commonly exhibits a tower one each of the three shrines. The temple is built on a jagati (a platform that is about a meter high) which serves the purpose of pradakshinapatha (circumambulation) as the shrine has no such arrangement in Hoysala temples.Kamath (2001), p.135 The entrance to the temple is through an open pillared hall or porch (mukhamantapa) followed by a closed hall (mantapa or navaranga).Foekema (1996), p.25 The porch consists of an awning supported by lathe turned half pillars and parapets on either side.Foekema (1996), p.24 The inner wall of the shrine is square and plain where as the outer wall is stellate (star shaped) with numerous recesses and projections that are used for decorative relief. The closed central hall which has no windows connects to the three sanctum via a vestibule (called sukhanasi). The vestibule also as a tower (also called sukhanasi) which looks like a low protrusion of the main tower over the shrine. The outer wall of the vestibule is decorative but inconspicuous because it appears like a short continuation of the shrine outer wall. The ceiling of the closed hall is supported by lathe turned pillars.Foekema (1996), pp.21-22 With regards to outer wall decoration, what Hardy calls \\"two tier\\", Foekema designates as the \\"old style\\" with two sets of eves: one eaves runs around the temple where the superstructure meets the outer wall of the shrines, below which are miniature decorative towers on pilasters (called aedicula). Below this is a second eves followed by a panel of Hindu deities in relief and finally a set of moldings at the base.Foekema (1996), p93 The design of the tower, according to art historian Percy Brown, is a characteristic feature to the Hoysala art. According to Brown, the stellate form of the base of the shrine with its projections and recesses is carried through the tower giving it a \\"fluted effect\\". The tower is divided into tiers with each tier diminishing in height and culminating in an umbrella like structure.Brown in Kamath (1980), pp.134-135 Brown also claims the lathe turned pillars with four brackets above are a signature style of the 11th-13th century Chalukya-Hoysala architectural idiom.Brown in Kamath (1980), p.134  Notes References * Gerard Foekema, A Complete Guide to Hoysala Temples, Abhinav, 1996, New Delhi, Adam Hardy, Indian Temple Architecture: Form and Transformation : the Kar·πáƒÅ·π≠a DrƒÅvi·∏ça Tradition, 7th to 13th Centuries, Abhinav, 1995, New Delhi, .

Oki was an original member of the Z-Boys, and competed with the Zephyr Competition Team in the 1970s. She was the only female member of the Z-Boys. Early life and education Oki was born in Los Angeles, California, to Ben Oki and Sadako Oki (n√©e Haramoto). Oki's father was a Sacramento-born Nisei. Oki's family is originally from Hiroshima, Japan. Oki grew up in West Los Angeles, in an area later called Dogtown. Her father bought Oki (and her brother) her first skateboard when she was 10 years old from the Fedco department store. She said it was a Black Knight skateboard with \\"Fred Flintstone (stone-age) rock wheels\\". In 1973, Oki graduated from Venice High School. Oki has an AA in biology from Santa Monica City College. She has an AA in fine and studio arts (with Honors) from Santa Barbara City College. Oki received a BFA in painting from the College of Creative Studies at UCSB with an emphasis on environmental art. Career In the 1970s, while attending Santa Monica City College, Oki began skating on the original Zephyr Competition Team also known Z-Boys. Oki, who was a surfer and motocross rider, met skateboarder Jay Adams, who asked her if she wanted to join the Zephyr team. Oki went to Jeff Ho's shop Jeff Ho Surfboards and Zephyr Productions on Main Street in Venice, where the team was based, and joined the team. Oki's skateboarding style was described as raw and gritty. In March 1975, Oki took first place in Women's Freestyle at the Del Mar Nationals skateboarding competition. Oki said that she did not enjoy the politics of competing or the wait time involved where there wasn't much skating happening, so stopped shortly after the Del Mar event. Since 1998, Oki has worked as a freelance illustrator and graphic designer selling fine art cards as Oki Designs. Oki has also worked freelance in the fields of landscape and architectural design. In 2001, Oki appeared in the film Dogtown and Z-Boys. From 2003 to 2008, Oki taught art at Santa Barbara City College, Continuing Education and youth art programs through the Carpinteria Valley Arts Council.

AsAP was developed by researchers in the VLSI Computation Laboratory (VCL) at the University of California, Davis and achieves high performance and energy-efficiency, while using a relatively small circuit area. AsAP processors are well suited for implementation in future fabrication technologies, and are clocked in a globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) fashion. Individual oscillators fully halt (leakage only) in 9 cycles when there is no work to do, and restart at full speed in less than one cycle after work is available. The chip requires no crystal oscillators, phase-locked loops, delay-locked loops, global clock signal, or any global frequency or phase-related signals whatsoever. The multi-processor architecture efficiently makes use of task- level parallelism in many complex DSP applications, and also efficiently computes many large tasks using fine-grained parallelism. Key features Block diagrams of a single AsAP processor and the 6x6 AsAP 1.0 chip AsAP uses several novel key features, of which four are: * Chip multi-processor (CMP) architecture designed to achieve high performance and low power for many DSP applications. * Small memories and a simple architecture in each processor to achieve high energy efficiency. * Globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) clocking simplifies the clock design, greatly increases ease of scalability, and can be used to further reduce power dissipation. * Inter- processor communication is performed by a nearest neighbor network to avoid long global wires and increase scalability to large arrays and in advanced fabrication technologies. Each processor can receive data from any two neighbors and send data to any combination of its four neighbors. AsAP 1 chip: 36 processors Die photograph of the first generation 36-processor AsAP chip A chip containing 36 (6x6) programmable processors was taped-out in May 2005 in 0.18Œºm CMOS using a synthesized standard cell technology and is fully functional. Processors on the chip operate at clock rates from 520 MHz to 540 MHz at 1.8V and each processor dissipates 32 mW on average while executing applications at 475 MHz. Most processors run at clock rates over 600 MHz at 2.0V, which makes AsAP among the highest known clock rate fabricated processors (programmable or non-programmable) ever designed in a university; it is the second highest known in published research papers. At 0.9V, the average application power per processor is 2.4 mW at 116 MHz. Each processor occupies only 0.66mm¬≤. AsAP 2 chip: 167 processors Die photograph of the second generation 167-processor AsAP 2 chip A second generation 65 nm CMOS design contains 167 processors with dedicated fast Fourier transform (FFT), Viterbi decoder, and video motion estimation processors; 16 KB shared memories; and long-distance inter-processor interconnect. The programmable processors can individually and dynamically change their supply voltage and clock frequency. The chip is fully functional. Processors operate up to 1.2 GHz at 1.3 V which is believed to be the highest clock rate fabricated processor designed in any university. At 1.2 V, they operate at 1.07 GHz and 47 mW when 100% active. At 0.675 V, they operate at 66 MHz and 608 ŒºW when 100% active. This operating point enables 1 trillion MAC or arithmetic logic unit (ALU) ops/sec with a power dissipation of only 9.2 watts. Due to its MIMD architecture and fine-grain clock oscillator stalling, this energy efficiency per operation is almost perfectly constant across widely varying workloads, which is not the case for many architectures. Applications The coding of many DSP and general tasks for AsAP has been completed. Mapped tasks include: filters, convolutional coders, interleavers, sorting, square root, CORDIC sin/cos/arcsin/arccos, matrix multiplication, pseudo random number generators, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) of lengths 32‚Äì1024, a complete k=7 Viterbi decoder, a JPEG encoder, a complete fully compliant baseband processor for an IEEE 802.11a/g wireless LAN transmitter and receiver, and a complete CAVLC compression block for an H.264 encoder. Blocks plug directly together with no required modifications. Power, throughput, and area results are typically many times better than existing programmable DSP processors.

The school mascot is the Pioneer, specifically Pioneer Pete, in honor of the city being founded in 1850 by a group of Mormon pioneers. The school has progressed from 3A to 5A in the last five years due to recent growth in nearby Saratoga Springs, Lehi, and Eagle Mountain. History In the late 1800s, the students met in the attic of the old Central School, but as patrons demanded more structure and formality for their students in the secondary grades, Lehi High School was created in 1908. The mascot was originally the Wolverine, and the school colors were blue and white. When a new grammar school was constructed, Central School became exclusively a high school. In 1912, the colors were changed from blue and white to purple and white, but it was not until 1925 that the mascot was changed to the Pelicans because newspaper reporters in Salt Lake City felt a wolverine was too violent to be a high school mascot. In 1934‚Äì35, the student body voted to change the mascot to a pioneer, an image symbolic of Lehi's pioneer heritage.. In 1921, a new high school was constructed for $92,834 and was subsequently renovated to include an auditorium. Several additions came later including a grandstand, an auto mechanics shop, a choral music/band room, and an office area. Students thrived as new and varied opportunities became available. Junior high and senior high students together attended the two-story high school. In the early 1950s, it became apparent that new high schools were needed to accommodate the growth in the area. Three high schools were planned for Alpine School District in Pleasant Grove, American Fork, and Lehi. All schools were similar in architecture. The three schools opened in the fall of 1959. Lehi High School has undergone several renovations since its initial opening to accommodate the increase in student population and to meet seismic requirements.LHS History - Information from the article ‚ÄúLehi High School Celebrates 100 Years‚Äù by Donna Barnes An aerial view of Lehi High School in 2019 In 2009, the school was reduced to a 4A with the opening of Westlake High School in Saratoga Springs. In 2011, with growth in the Lehi area, the school again returned to 5A. However, in Fall 2016, a new school was built in Northern Lehi: Skyridge High School. Also, in the later months of 2016, it was announced that in the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, a 6A region would be introduced. As a result of these two changes, it was announced that in the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, Lehi High School will move to 4A again. Lehi High School will move to 4A for every sport except for football where they will remain in the 5A region. Academics Lehi High School was ranked in the top-scoring 50 high schools in Utah, based on students' scores in Utah's Criterion Referenced Tests (CRT). The percentage of students who met proficiency standards were as follows: Language Arts 88.28%, Mathematics 67.99%, and Science 58.81%, all above average for the state. The Advanced Placement participation rate at Lehi High is 28% with an 81% passing rate. Lehi High School has a student to teacher ratio of 24:1. Student body As of 2016, Lehi High School had a total student enrollment of 2,604. 88% of those students were Caucasian, 7% Hispanic, 1% American Indian, 1% Pacific Islander, 1% Black, and 1% Asian. 51% of the student population were male, 49% female. 16% of students came from economically disadvantaged families.

After graduating from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1911, Horii served in China before undertaking a variety of regimental appointments. Following Japan's entry into World War II, he commanded a division during the capture of Guam before commanding the Japanese force that had been given the task of capturing Port Moresby. In November 1942, in the retreat from Oivi‚ÄìGorari, Horii drowned while attempting to canoe down the Kumusi River to reach Japanese forces defending Buna‚ÄìGona. His canoe was swept out to sea and capsized. Biography Born in Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Horii became an infantry officer following his graduation from the 23rd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1911. He was later assigned to the headquarters of the Shanghai Expeditionary Army, and in early 1932 during the prelude to the Second Sino-Japanese War, was involved in the January 28 Incident. From 1935 to 1937, Horii was attached to the IJA 12th Infantry Regiment, having previously attended Waseda University. He became commander of the IJA 78th Infantry Regiment in 1938, after his promotion to colonel the previous year. In March 1940, Horii was promoted to major general. The following year Horii was appointed commander of the Nankai-Detachment (Nankai-ShitaiÔºàÂçóÊµ∑ÊîØÈöäÔºâ) of the IJA 55th Division, part of the South Seas Force. Horii led this organization in the Japanese invasion and subsequent capture of Guam during December 8‚Äì10, 1941; following this engagement, Horii served briefly as the Japanese military Governor of Guam. During the New Guinea campaign, Horii and his South Seas Force were assigned to the invasion of Port Moresby, but were turned back after the escorting naval force was attacked by Allied forces during the Battle of the Coral Sea. The Japanese then planned an overland attack to capture the town by advancing from the north coast. In July 1942, they landed to established beachheads at Buna, Gona and Sanananda. This marked the beginning of the Kokoda Track campaign. The South Seas Force, under Horii's command, advanced using the Kokoda Track to cross the rugged Owen Stanley Range. By 16 September, after heavy fighting against a small Australian Army force, Horii's command had advanced as far as Ioribaiwa, and was close enough to see the lights of Port Moresby. In light of reverses at Guadalcanal, the Japanese command determined it could not support both battles and, on 23 September, Horii was ordered to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided. Limited provision had been made for the resupply of Horii's force and, by this time, the situation had reached a crisis. On 26 September, the Japanese commenced to withdraw from the front line. They fought a well-ordered rear-guard action back over the Owen Stanley Range, with the Australian forces in close pursuit. Horii's force had been severely depleted by lack of supply but at Oivi, near the northern end of the Kokoda Track, Horii's force received both resupply and reinforcement. The Japanese suffered heavily in the battle around Oivi‚ÄìGorari from 4 to 11 November, and the well-ordered withdrawal that had been planned quickly disintegrated into a rout. The Australians crossed the Kumusi River at Wairopi on 16 November and were now about 65 km (40 mi) from Buna‚ÄìGona. The flooded river blocked the retreat of Horii's force. Horii decided to raft down the river with a small party so he might more quickly reach the Buna‚ÄìGona positions that were being threatened by the Australian advance. Gunfire had been heard from the coast. When the raft became snagged on trees, he took to a canoe that was found by the river's edge. The canoe was swept out to sea and capsized during a storm. Horii drowned but his orderly survived to report his death. Horii was posthumously promoted to lieutenant general. cited in .

Commissioned reviews = SET for Success  In March 2001, the UK Government commissioned Roberts to undertake a review into the supply of science and engineering skills in the UK. The final report, entitled SET for Success was published on 15 April 2003. The report set out thirty-seven recommendations to the Government, employers and other organisations about how to maintain and develop the supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematical skills into research and industry. All his recommendations were accepted by the Government. These included providing additional resources for schools, universities and research bodies, and the promotion of school/business links. The review led to increase of the stipend paid to PhD students, and a number of initiatives to encourage women and young people to consider a career in science. The review of research assessment In June 2002, after the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) of 2001, the four funding bodies for UK higher education commissioned Sir Gareth Roberts to review the future of research assessment in the UK. The report \\"The review of research assessment\\" was issued for consultation in May 2003. Many of Roberts' recommendations were implemented for the 2008 RAE, the first review following the completion of the consultation exercise.

The fee was established by the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act of 1986 (AB 2020, Margolin), and since 2010 the program has been administered by the Cal/EPA California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) (it was previously administered by the California Department of Conservation, Division of Recycling). Other states have similar bottle bills/deposit laws, including Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont. Regulatory system The bottler pays CRV for beverages with aluminum, plastic, glass, and bimetal containers and anyone can receive the same amount in exchange for the container by bringing it to a recycling center. The symbol on beverage containers eligible for reimbursement is \\"CA CRV\\". Currently, CRV is 5 cents for containers less than and 10 cents for containers or larger. The state also allows recyclers to pay by weight, for which the state also sets a separate minimum price per pound (kg). When redeeming in quantities up to 50 containers, the consumer has the right to be paid by count on request. In larger quantities, the recycler has discretion. Recyclers have the right to refuse or offer a reduced price for contaminated materials. It is illegal to bring in out of state cans or bottles to California to recoup the CRV and violators can be charged with fraud, a felony. The charge for California Redemption Value is similar to bottle bill deposits used in other states, but is technically a fee imposed on the distributor of the beverage. The fee tends to be passed along to the retailer and to the consumer via normal market forces. Distributors and retailers usually break out the CRV as a distinct part of the purchase price in advertising and on receipts (for example the charge for a 50-cent bottle of soda may appear on the receipt as \\"45 cents plus 5 cents CRV\\"). One way the difference between CRV and a system in which the consumer pays a deposit or tax shows up is that sales tax applies to the CRV amount, if the item is subject to sales tax. If it were not part of the basic price of the product, sales tax would not apply to it. Accordingly, when the State of California raised the CRV from $0.04 on 2 L bottles and $0.02 on cans to $0.08 and $0.04, respectively, then again to $0.10 and $0.05, respectively, it was also raising California's sales tax revenue gained on the imposed fee. Types of beverages CRV is paid on the following types of beverages: * Carbonated and noncarbonated water * Carbonated and noncarbonated soft drinks, energy drinks, and sport drinks * Coffee and tea drinks * Beer and other malt beverages * Distilled Spirits Coolers (not distilled spirits) * 100% fruit juice in containers smaller than . CRV is not paid on the following: * Milk, white or flavored * Medical food * Infant formula * Wine * Distilled spirits * 100% fruit juice in containers or more * 100% vegetable juice in containers more than * Products not in liquid or \\"ready to drink\\" form * Products not intended for human consumption * Containers not made of glass, metal, or plastic Recycling centers In August 2019, California's largest recycling redemption and processing centers operator, RePlanet, announced closing all 284 of its remaining centers, ceasing operations, terminating 750 employees, and beginning the process of liquidating assets to pay creditors, because of continued reduction in State fees, the depressed pricing of recycled aluminum and PET plastic, minimum wage increases, and the rise in operating costs. In February 2016, RePlanet had closed 191 recycling centers and terminated nearly 300 employees in smaller communities across California, due to the same causes. Issues with implementation Fresno State had trash bins along with dedicated beverage containers recycling receptacles. Despite their best effort to secure them against theft including keeping them under lock and key, they were forced to remove the beverage receptacles as for \\"vagrants would break the locks and steal the contents\\", according to Fresno State's manager for office of environmental health safety, risk management and sustainability.  Declining value of materials From recyclable containers  The falling market value of materials that redeemable containers are made of such as metal, plastic or glass has lead to a decrease in the viability of many local recycling centers. CalRecycle, the agency that overseas the CRV program, reported in 2016 that recycling rates had declined below their goal of 80%. It is estimated that around 1.7 million containers were not recycled as a result of the decline over the past five years, ending up in dumps instead. Barriers to ease of recycling has effectively caused consumers to lose, as the LA Times reported, \\"at least $308 million in 5-cent deposits on cans and bottles in 2018\\". The incentive to process the containers has decreased in monetary amount along with inflation further devaluing the incentive. A later bill, The California beverage container recycling law, attempted to solve the initial shortcomings by requiring that when not within half of a mile from a recycling center, that the markets themselves must accept CRV qualified containers or be fined a daily rate. This has not completely solved the issue as many companies choose not to accept recycles but do not pay the fine, similar to the litigation between the state of California and CVS as recent as December of 2019.
